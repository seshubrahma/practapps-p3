Students at Forest Grove High School in Oregon protested Thursday over a banner hung briefly in the school hallway this week that read "build a wall," per a report by Oregon Live.  Chief of staff for the Forest Grove School District Connie Potter said the sign, which was put up on Wednesday, was up briefly, but prompted a rather quick response by the reportedly about half Latino student body. Potter said the sign was put up after the school’s Unity Week. According to her, students had put up "  signs," and then a "build the wall" sign was hung over one of the posters. She added that a teacher was able to remove the sign swiftly. "It was immediately taken down, within literally a minute or two, and the students who hung it have been disciplined," she said. Students offended by the banner organized a demonstration and have taken to Twitter and Instagram to express their anger using the hashtag, #standupFG. Hundreds of students from reportedly at least five other high schools walked out of class and marched on Main Street near Forest Grove. "Build a wall" references presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s intentions to build a wall at the United   border. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
