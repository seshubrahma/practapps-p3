Authorities are suspecting terrorism as the cause of the Egyptian jet crash over the Mediterranean Sea early this morning, but the White House doesn’t want to jump to conclusions. [White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest released a statement reminding Americans that it was unclear what caused the crash.  "At this time we do not yet know definitively what caused the disappearance of Flight 804," he said, while offering the country’s "deepest condolences" to the 66 people who were killed aboard the flight. The statement was released after a full day of investigating the crash, and a cautious response from the White House. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump quickly signaled on Twitter this morning that the event looked like terrorism, and criticized the Obama administration for failing to take the threat seriously. "When will we get tough, smart and vigilant?" he said. "Great hate and sickness!" When asked about Trump’s message, Earnest declined to engage the billionaire presidential candidate. "I don’t have a specific reaction to that Tweet," he said. "Obviously we believe that this investigation should move forward, and move forward expeditiously, and if conclusions point toward specific security concerns, then I’m confident that our security professionals will address it. " President Barack Obama has not yet personally responded to the crash. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addressed the crash several hours later in an afternoon interview with CNN. "It does appear that it was an act of terrorism," she said. "Exactly how, of course, the investigation will have to determine. "
