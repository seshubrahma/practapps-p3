Comedian and   activist Chelsea Handler took to Twitter Saturday and posted a vulgar message questioning the sex lives of Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Mitch McConell, and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. ["I can’t believe @tedcruz wife still fucks him," Handler’s wrote. "Is anyone fucking @SpeakerRyan ? Oh, right. @MitchMcConell takes care of that. "  I can’t believe @tedcruz wife still fucks him.

In a tweet which appeared to condone a Saturday Night Live writer’s attack on the    son of the president and first lady, Handler wrote: "It’s interesting that a writer on SNL is held to a higher standard of language than the man we elected @POTUS @katiemaryrich #stupid.

Handler sported a pussyhat and led a large group of demonstrators at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah for the Women’s March on Main, a march to protest Trump’s inauguration.
