Sunday on NBC’s "Meet the Press," MSNBC anchor, and commentator Andrea Mitchell said, the "awful egging of the Trump supporter in San Jose" can not be separated "from the egging on" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does at his rallies.  Mitchell  said, "I just came back from California and, I’m heading back there tonight. The fact is that there is tremendous antipathy right now around this whole race. Yet when they closed the registration for California, on Friday night, Sacramento secretary of state announced it is unprecedented, historic, almost 18 million people now registered.   percent of those eligible have registered to vote. And this is, I think, really generated by the concern that the Hispanics and others have about Donald Trump.  That awful awful egging of the Trump supporter in San Jose is, I think, you can’t separate it from the egging on, no pun intended, in North Carolina and elsewhere, that he did at his rallies. And what we have come to is a really bad place. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
