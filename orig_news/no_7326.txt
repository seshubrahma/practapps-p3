"  "It was really a sneak   …     it was really something that they didn’t want publicized, as I understand it, is that correct?" Trump added, "Wow. " "I think it’s so terrible. I think it’s so horrible. I think it’s   …     one of the big stories of this week, of this month, of this year," Trump suggested. Trump was commenting on a short meeting on a private plane between Lynch and Clinton earlier this week.
