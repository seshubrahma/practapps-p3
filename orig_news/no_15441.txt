July 5, 2016   Says he will not recommend charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state.

July 7, 2016   Testifies that he has been a registered Republican for most of his adult life but that he is "not registered any longer." He says the FBI is "resolutely apolitical." October 28, 2016   Eleven days before the presidential election, Comey informs Congress in a letter that the FBI is reviewing new emails related to Clinton’s time as secretary of state. The emails are discovered as part of an investigation into former Congressman Anthony Weiner and were sent or received by Clinton aide Huma Abedin, Weiner’s wife.

Comey also revealed that he orchestrated the leak of accounts of conversations with President Donald Trump because he thought it might lead to the appointment of a special prosecutor to lead the Russia investigation.
