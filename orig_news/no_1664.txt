(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump continued to battle it out, making sequential   appearances at a forum on national security. Ahead of the event, Mr. Trump proposed ending caps on military spending. Both candidates lay claim to major backing from the military. If you feel whipsawed by polls that seem uncertain about how much Mr. Trump has gained on Mrs. Clinton, one of our   experts explains the fluctuations and reassures us that   polls over the next few weeks are likely to be highly predictive. _____ 2. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter lashed out at Russia, which the F. B. I. believes hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s computer systems. In a speech at Oxford University, he accused Vladimir Putin’s government of demonstrating a "clear ambition to erode" international order and warned that the U. S. "will not ignore attempts to interfere with our democratic processes. " Above, the secretary last month. _____ 3. Win or lose in November, Donald Trump is coming to Pennsylvania Avenue. The Trump International Hotel, Washington D. C. will bring   service and stratospheric prices to the historic Old Post Office, six blocks from the White House. But it’s also as polarizing as many other aspects of Mr. Trump. The preservationist architect on the project, who resigned last year over differences, said, "He does not deserve this building. " _____ 4. Apple announced a range of updates and improvements across its full line at its annual product showcase, but the big focus was the new iPhone 7. Its lack of a headphone jack means the device can be   (oh be joyful) the company can sell wireless earbuds (ouch, $160) and the future looks a lot less like a tangle of wires. Our tech columnist sees a telling lack of dazzle. _____ 5. The Paralympic Games opened in Rio. Some 4, 300 athletes representing 161 nations and a team representing the world’s refugees will compete over the next 10 days. Shortfalls in ticket sales and sponsorships forced cuts in the number of workers, transportation options and sports venues, but not the number of events (live streaming on TeamUSA. org). _____ 6. At the U. S. Open, it’s the last of the quarterfinals. Kei Nishikori beat Andy Murray, so he’ll face the winner of tonight’s match between Stan Wawrinka and Juan Martin del Potro. And Serena Williams beat Simona Halep, bringing her in sight of her seventh U. S. Open crown and a record 23rd Grand Slam singles title. Looking at Williams’s backhand step by step reveals some of the secrets of her power. Here’s our full coverage of the tournament. _____ 7. Britain and France agreed to wall in an access road to the French port of Calais, to keep migrants from climbing aboard trucks and other vehicles in a bid to get to England. At least eight migrants have died trying to do so this year, despite miles of fences, barbed wire and surveillance cameras already in place. _____ 8. Signs of fall are everywhere: Leaves are turning, football is nigh, and New York has begun Fashion Week. Kanye West commanded a fleet of buses to move models, above, and guests to his Yeezy line’s fourth season show on Roosevelt Island, and Tom Ford led the breakaway movement to use the fall shows to  —   show fall clothes. It’s part of a     model cracking through long tradition at the fashion shows. Speaking of tradition, check out our   oral history of more than 70 years of New York Fashion Week, with the voices of Diane von Furstenberg, Donna Karan, Michael Kors and more. _____ 9. New details emerged of Edward Snowden’s path after he fled the U. S. in 2013 with details of how the National Security Agency’s vast program of surveillance had swept in millions of Americans. Four men and women, all asylum seekers and clients of one of Mr. Snowden’s Hong Kong lawyers, spoke of harboring him in cramped apartments in poor districts. One said she didn’t know who he was until she bought him a paper. "Oh my God, unbelievable," she recalled saying to herself. "The most wanted man in the world is in my house. " _____ 10. Finally, a veteran of a World War   unit of female pilots was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. Elaine Harmon, who died last year at the age of 95, served with the Women Airforce Service Pilots, who performed many flying tasks, some in great danger, to free male pilots for combat. The role is now congressionally recognized as warranting the honor of burial at Arlington. A chaplain read from a poem written by a WASP: "Thank God that now her flight can be to heights her eyes had   she can race with comets, and buzz the rainbow’s span.
