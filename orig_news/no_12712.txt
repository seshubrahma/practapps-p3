During Saturday’s Republican presidential debate on CBS, GOP presidential candidates Donald Trump and former Gov. Jeb Bush ( ) battled over Russia’s involvement in taking down ISIS.  First, Bush said he would take down Syrian President Bashar Assad and it would be "absolutely ludicrous" to believe Russia could be a partner of the United States. "Let me just tell you this. Jeb is so wrong," Trump said to the tune of boos from the crowd. " You know what that is? That’s Jeb’s special interests and lobbyists talking. Look, let me just tell you something Jeb is so wrong. You’ve got to fight ISIS first. You fight ISIS first. Right now, you have Russia. You have Iran. You have them with Assad and you have them with Syria. You have to knock out ISIS. They’re chopping off heads. These are animals. You have to knock them out. You have to knock them off strong. You decide what to do after. You can’t fight two wars at one time. If you listen to [Jeb Bush] and listen to some of the folks that I’ve been listening to  —   that’s why we’ve been in the Middle East for 15 years and we haven’t won anything. We’ve spent $5 trillion in the Middle East because of thinking like that. " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
