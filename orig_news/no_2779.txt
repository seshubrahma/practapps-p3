(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Signs of friction threatened to undercut a deal between Ted Cruz and John Kasich to coordinate against Donald Trump. Mr. Trump is expected to dominate in Tuesday’s primaries in five northeastern states, but his delegate count could fall short if he loses in Indiana next week, allowing the rivals to fight it out at the convention. Polls show Bernie Sanders gaining on Hillary Clinton in Rhode Island, Connecticut and Indiana, though she appears ahead in Pennsylvania and Maryland. _____ 2. President Obama, wrapping up a   trip to Europe, said he would send 250 more U. S. military personnel to Syria to help local forces fight the Islamic State. Addressing Europe’s economic and migration problems, he appeared to refer to Mr. Trump’s divisive politics. Mr. Obama said challenging conditions opened the door to "those who would try to exploit those fears and frustrations and channel them in a destructive way. " _____ 3. The family of Tamir Rice, the    fatally shot by the Cleveland police in 2014, is set to receive $6 million if a court approves. It’s the latest in a series of   settlements made by major cities over the deaths of   at the hands of the police. _____ 4. Beyoncé’s surprise album, "Lemonade," and an accompanying video focus on the harm men have done to black women, insinuated that her husband, Jay Z, had an affair. (Above, the couple last year.) Her admirers  —   the Beyhive  —   took the other woman identified in song as "Becky with the good hair" to be the designer Rachel Roy. But, oops, some accidentally exacted their social media revenge on the Food Network star Rachael Ray. (Also oops, we spelled her name Rachel earlier.) _____ 5. Tough news for the Golden State Warriors. Stephen Curry is likely to be out for at least two weeks because of a sprained right knee. The king of   will miss, at minimum, the start of the second round of the N. B. A. playoffs. He took a positive tone on Twitter: "Thanks 4 all the prayers  messages. Can feel all the positive energy. God is Great! All things considered I’m Gonna be alright!" _____ 6. Football made headlines off the field. A U. S. appeals court reinstated Tom Brady’s   suspension in the Deflategate case, agreeing that the N. F. L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, had broad discretion to suspend players. And Johnny Manziel, the      quarterback, pictured above in December, was indicted on a misdemeanor assault charge. Commentary on his fall, our reporter says, exposes "the underbelly of fandom. " _____ 7. At North Carolina’s statehouse, supporters and critics held battling protests over a law blocking protections for gay people and limiting transgender people’s bathroom access. _____ 8. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced a "road map for  " to help those leaving prison stay out. The plan includes a federal focus on job training and substance abuse treatment before release, and closer monitoring after. And Ms. Lynch urged states to allow the newly released to trade their prisoner IDs for   IDs. Above, an auto repair training shop at the Louisiana state penitentiary in Angola. _____ 9. An international panel’s  report on 43 missing Mexican students reverberated through the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto. The students had been engaged in a night of confrontation with the police that turned unexpectedly violent before they disappeared, the report said, countering the official narrative that they fell victim to a drug gang. _____ 10. China halted plans for    power stations in many parts of the country after signing the Paris climate accord. That means about planned 200 plants, with a combined generating capacity of 105 gigawatts, may not be built. "It’s a lot of power," a coal specialist said. "It’s a heck of a lot of power. " _____ 11. Finally, meet a few of the dwindling population of the world’s largest primate, Grauer’s gorilla. Conservationists say years of conflict in the jungles of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have eased, enabling them to make a head count that confirmed their fears. With fewer than 3, 800 remaining, extinction is possible. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
