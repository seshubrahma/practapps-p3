NASA’s top climate scientist Gavin Schmidt has warned   Donald Trump that the planet just won’t stand for having a   climate denier in the White House. [Good luck with that one, Gavin. Or "Toast" as we’ll shortly be calling you  …      Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) told the Independent: According to Bob Walker, who has advised Mr Trump on space policy, Nasa has been reduced to "a logistics agency concentrating on space station resupply and politically correct environmental monitoring". Mr Walker, a former congressman who chaired President George W. Bush’s Commission on the Future of the US Aerospace Industry, told The Telegraph: "We would start by having a stretch goal of exploring the entire solar system by the end of the century. "You stretch your technology experts and create technologies that wouldn’t otherwise be needed. I think aspirational goals are a good thing. Fifty years ago it was the ability to go to the moon. " I guess that’s bye bye Gavin Schmidt then. He’s beginning to sound very much like a luxury the U. S. taxpayer cannot afford.
