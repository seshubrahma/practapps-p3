Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump argued that Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton can only offer welfare checks during a speech before The Economic Club of New York in New York City, NY on Thursday.  Trump said, "The only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton are the donors and the special interests, but bad for our country. In Hillary Clinton’s America we have surrendered our status as the world’s great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries. We take care of them better than we take care of ourselves. Not one single idea she’s got will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can offer is a welfare check. That’s about it. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they’re going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed or underemployed.
