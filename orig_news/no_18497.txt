’  ’ ’   US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley  that President Donald Trump believes "the climate is   changing" during an interview that will air on Sunday.  ’ ’   Tapper initially asked Haley to confirm whether or not Trump   still believed his famous 2013 claim that global warming was a   hoax "invented by and for the Chinese" in order to hurt US   manufacturing. ’ ’   "What I will tell you is the regulations from the Paris Agreement   were [a disadvantage to] our companies. We know that," Haley   said. "I knew that as a governor, we know that now. The jobs were   not attainable as long as we had to live under those   regulations."  ’ ’   She added that the US would continue to be a leader on   environmental protection. "The rest of the world wanted to tell   us how to do it. We’’re saying, ’’We will do it, but we’’ll do it   under our terms,’’" Haley said.  ’ ’   Tapper replied and said that the standards Haley was referring to   were set by the US and not by other countries. ’ ’’ ’   "No, the standards were set by President Obama and not passed   through the Senate because the standards couldn’’t have been   achieved," Haley interjected. ’ ’   "Yeah, but my point is, you said the world was imposing standards   on the United States," Tapper replied.
