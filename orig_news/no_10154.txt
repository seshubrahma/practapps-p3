Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos spoke to GQ Australia in a recent feature about his support of Donald Trump, his anti Muslim views, and the   political movement. [The piece gives a brief synopsis of Milo’s personal history and childhood, his career as a journalist, and the multitude of fans that adore him as well as the detractors who don’t. Describing Milo, the piece says:  The global   could hardly have engineered a more exquisitely suited vessel for its messaging than Milo Yiannopoulos. 33 years old, stylish and photogenic, he’s flamboyantly gay (the gleeful   defence to cries of discrimination) charismatic and witty. He’s also mercilessly unflappable on nearly every   political topic.   …     If you’ve ever met a true narcissist, you’ve met Milo. Extreme   and an ability to twist anything to conform his superiority are familiar traits  —   concentric layers of   defences to ensure that his core, whatever it may be, is never exposed to danger. Milo’s response: I think I’m the best human that I know. I’m the best at being a person, a successful,   person. I’m incredibly   disciplined, driven, successful, handsome, popular, funny. I’m really good at being a person. There’s really not very much I dislike about myself. The article tends to agree with Milo’s description of himself, saying, "Yiannopoulos is also witty, annoyingly charming and highly entertaining  —   a most fucked up mutation of joie de vivre, his flair and callousness that of a teen anarchist who never grew up.
