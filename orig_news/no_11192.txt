A day of reckoning is coming for both presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her mysterious aide Huma Abedin. This issue: Hillary Clinton’s relationship with Saudi Arabia, a U. S. "ally" that the 28 Pages report just brought into the bright sunlight. [(Don’t blame me for putting the scare quotes around "ally"  —   it’s right there, in scare quotes, in the report itself on the page numbered 415.)  Hillary Clinton is going to have to answer to media or (more likely, since the media doesn’t do their job) she can answer on live TV in front of millions of Americans when Donald Trump hits her a question about Saudi Arabia and Huma at one of the debates. With the political convention season upon us, the silent majority of Americans who don’t pay close attention to politics are about to start tuning in. Those good Americans will find out that both Huma and Hillary have a lot of explaining to do about Saudi Arabia, the big money that the Kingdom has given to the Clintons, and why Hillary knew the Saudis were funding terrorism and didn’t do anything about it. The public will have questions about Saudi   Huma Abedin, a woman who I’ve already said I believe is a Saudi plant. If our media even TRIED to do their job and tell citizens the truth, the 28 Pages would sink Hillary Clinton faster than Ted Kennedy’s car sank in the dark waters of Chappaquiddick one July night. An issue like the Saudi influence on the government and the Kingdom’s support for terrorism is where Donald Trump’s populism comes into all its glory. I don’t care whether you’re a staunch conservative or proud progressive, almost nobody likes or trusts Saudi Arabia. Everyone knows that the Saudis are out for themselves and are our "ally" in the same way a scorpion is an ally to a frog when it needs to get across the river. The 28 Pages report confirms this in a section that’s title says it all: Lack of Cooperation in Counterterrorism Investigations. The problem has been that Clinton, Bush, and Obama have all been in Saudi Arabia’s pocket. (Do those bedsheets they wear even have pockets? I’m a fashion expert, so I SHOULD know these things!) When you have an issue with the political elites of both parties on one side and most of the American people on the other, it’s exactly why Donald J. Trump is the ideal man for his time. It’s been over 200 days since Hillary Clinton did a press conference. She didn’t do a single presser since last year. Not one since voting started in the primaries. Even the Washington Post slammed her for it, calling it: " remarkable. And remarkably bad. " And when Hillary loses the Washington Post’s cheerleading on anything, that is remarkably bad. Why has Hillary avoided the press? Because, just like Hillary sucked at being Secretary of State, she sucks at answering questions from the media. Take the last presser she did, all the way back in December 2015. Andrea Mitchell asked Hillary a question about the Saudis and couldn’t help fawn like a schoolgirl: "  …    could you answer the questions that have been raised about foreign contributions from Middle Eastern countries, like Saudi Arabia, that abuse women or permit violence against women to the family foundation and whether that disturbs you as you are rightly celebrating 20 years of leadership on this issue?" I’ll quote Hillary’s whole answer because it’s just remarkably bad: With respect to the foundation, I am very proud of the work the foundation does. I’m very proud of the hundreds of thousands of people who support the work of the foundation and the results that have been achieved for people here at home and around the world. And I think that we are very clear about where we stand, certainly where I stand, on all of these issues. There can’t be any mistake about my passion concerning women’s rights here at home and around the world. So I think that people who want to support the foundation know full well what it is we stand for and what we’re working on. Read it again. That’s not an answer. Hillary doesn’t even mention the Saudis by name. She just rattles on about how great the work her foundation does. For a lefty like Hillary, saying you have good intentions gets you off every hook. It’s a serious issue, especially given Huma Abedin’s Saudi connections, so let’s go further than Andrea Mitchell did: Bill and Hillary took many millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia  —   a country that violates the   rights of women, men, gays, Christians, Shi’ite Muslims, and anyone else it feels like with punishments like public beheadings  —   and Hillary Clinton took that Saudi money knowing that they sponsor terrorism. Hillary knew they sponsored the Taliban,   and Hamas and she still took their money. A 2011 email exchange between   of State Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin shows that both women had personal knowledge of reports from State Department that the Saudis and UAE were spending an estimated $100, 000, 000 a year funding the spread of the Sunni Wahhabism that drives all the world’s major Islamist terrorism. The email from Huma Abedin was dated Sunday, May 22, 2011, 08:04 AM and it quoted a Reuters story: Islamic charities from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates financed a network in U. S. ally Pakistan that recruited children as young as eight to wage holy war, a local newspaper reported on Sunday, citing Wikileaks. A U. S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks said financial support estimated at $100 million a year was making its way from those Gulf Arab states to a jihadist recruitment network in Pakistan’s Punjab province, Dawn newspaper reported. The November 2008 dispatch by Bryan Hunt, the then principal officer at the U. S. consulate in Lahore, was based on discussions with local government and   sources during trips to Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province. It said those sources claimed that financial aid from Saudi and United Arab Emirates was coming from"missionary" and "Islamic charitable" organisations ostensibly with the direct support of those countries’ governments. Saudi Arabia, the United States and Pakistan heavily supported the Afghan mujahideen against Soviet occupation troops in the 1980s. More than a month later, on Tuesday, June 28, 2011, at 6:52 AM, Hillary Clinton then forwarded the email from her ClintonEmail. com account to another aide at the State Department with the instructions "PIs print. " [sic] As a post on Foreign Policy in Focus reported: Bryan Hunt,   officer at the US consulate in Lahore, reported a string of troubling findings on his forays into southern Punjab, where he "was repeatedly told that a sophisticated jihadi recruitment network had been developed in the Multan, Bahawalpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan Divisions. "  …     Saudi Arabia, home to the fundamentalist Wahhabi brand of Islam, is seen as funding some of Pakistan’s hardline religious seminaries, or madrassas, which churn out young men eager for holy war, posing a threat to the stability of the region. "At these madrassas, children are denied contact with the outside world and taught sectarian extremism, hatred for   and     government philosophy," said the cable. In that November 13th, 2008, cable, Bryan Hunt made the claim: Government and   sources claimed that financial support estimated at nearly 100 million USD annually was making its way to Deobandi and    clerics in the region from ""missionary"" and ""Islamic charitable"" organizations in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ostensibly with the direct support of those governments. Need more proof that Hillary knew about Saudi funding of terrorism? The claim that Saudi Arabia was funding terrorism would be related with even more specificity the very next year by Hillary Clinton’s own State Department. It’s not like Hillary Clinton didn’t know about the threat of the Muslim World League. A memo went out in her own name about it. As Breitbart News Lead Investigative Reporter Lee Stranahan revealed for the first time this past week, a 2009 email from the Secretary of States office showed that during the Obama administration, Clinton’s department believed Saudi Arabia was funding terrorism through charities including a Saudi NGO called the Muslim World League. As that 2009 email said, the Saudis were only fighting terrorism inside their own borders but didn’t restrict funds for:   …    multilateral organizations such as the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO) Muslim World League (MWL) and the World Assembly of Muslim Youth (WAMY.) Intelligence suggests that these groups continue to send money overseas and, at times, fund extremism overseas. The specific mention of the Muslim World League is deeply troubling since Clinton’s closest aide Huma Abedin, as well as both her parents, her brother, and sister all worked for the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs, a group created by Saudi Arabia through the Muslim Word League to spread Wahhabism. As Stranahan also broke, the offices of Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs that none other thanVanity Fair called the "Abedin family business" are located in the London office of the Muslim World League and WAMY, the group mentioned by name in 28 pages. Both the 2008 email sent by Huma Abedin to Hillary Clinton and the 2009 email sent by Clinton’s own State Department agreed with previous assessments that the Saudi Arabia was a  . But it goes back even further  —   all the way back to Bill Clinton’s administration. The Muslim World League was named in an assessment during the Clinton administration in 1995. The Saudis spread their influence to George W. Bush, as well. The Muslim World League was removed from a list of terror funders less than a month after the   attack, Newsweek reported: Two interrelated global charities directly financed by the Saudi government —  the International Islamic Relief Organization and the Muslim World League  —  have been used by bin Laden to finance his operations. The organizations were left off the list of groups sanctioned by the United States last week, U. S. officials hinted to NEWSWEEK, in order to avoid embarrassing the Saudi government. Now, the revelations in the 28 Pages does even more damage: as Stranahan reports this week, it shows that the buried report ALSO says the parent group of Abedin’s "family business"  —   the Muslim World League’s WAMY  —   was known to have funded terrorism. As much as the MSM would like to write all of this off as a conspiracy theory, they just can’t dispute the fact that Hillary’s top aide is connected to a group that Hillary Clinton said is funding terrorism, that Bill Clinton’s administration to terror, that Bush connected to terror, and that the 28 Pages connect to terror. The media can’t dispute those facts, so they simply ignore the story and hope it goes away. So far, so good for Hillary and Huma. But how is Hillary Clinton going to avoid the Trump Train heading down the tracks and straight at her?
