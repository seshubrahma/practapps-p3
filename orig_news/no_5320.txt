Monday in Miami after attending a Martin Luther King Day event, while commenting on the controversy over Rep. John Lewis ( ) saying of   Donald Trump he didn’t "see the   as a legitimate president" and Trump’s tweeted response, Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) said he "hoped" the Trump would have responded differently "given everything that John Lewis means to our country. "  Rubio said, "I have tremendous admiration for Congressman Lewis, not only for what he has done but what he stand for, and that remains undiminished. I don’t agree with him that   Trump is illegitimate. I believe it was a legitimate election and that he was elected through that electoral process. I also don’t agree with his decision not to attend the inaugural although it certainly is his right because it is not about   Trump, it’s a peaceful transfer of power which is a distinguishing characteristic of our republic. That said, I also hoped the   would have responded differently given everything that John Lewis means to our country. But people make their own decisions and that’s were we stand, but that’s how I feel about it. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
