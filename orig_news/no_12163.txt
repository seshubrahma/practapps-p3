This article first appeared in The Harpers blog:  During a recent visit to the Dominican Republic, I gave a lot of thought to "globalization" —  a concept much discussed and much disputed in the current U.

Donald Trump denounces almost everything that comes from outside the U. S. (excluding, of course, his wife, Melania). From   agreements negotiated by "losers" at America’s expense to the insidious Mexican immigrants who are poaching our jobs to the numerous overseas military stupidities committed by both Republican and Democratic governments, the   billionaire paints a horrendous portrait of the lands beyond our borders. "We’re living in a very vicious world," he declared to Anderson Cooper of CNN last Tuesday. "You look at what the world is doing to us at every level, whether it’s militarily or in trade . . . The world is taking advantage of us, and it’s driving us into literally being a Third World nation. " Therefore Trump would like to withdraw from this   world, which persecutes innocent America, and erect barriers. "We’re a poor country now," he told the editorial board of the Washington Post. Bernie Sanders seems to be less scared, globally speaking. He often refers to his Polish roots, and his older brother immigrated to England. But Sanders also rails against free trade and the invasion of Iraq, even though he’s more sympathetic than Trump toward people perceived as "the other. " Both men affirm their determination to rebuild an America weakened by unhealthy relationships with the outside world. You can read the rest of the story here.
