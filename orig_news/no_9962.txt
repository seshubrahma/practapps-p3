Pollster and analyst Pat Caddell joined Breitbart New Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Monday to discuss the closing days of the election, including new revelations suggesting collusion between CNN and the Democratic National Committee. [Breitbart News reported the revelation on Monday: "A new WikiLeaks dump of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails shows CNN asked the party’s political operatives to draft questions for anchors Wolf Blitzer and Jake Tapper to interview Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. "  Caddell said Monday, "That’s why [CNN] did not want to have an investigation about Donna Brazile —  because they know what they’ve all been doing. The media has been blatant. " He also discussed polling he conducted on the issue as part of Breitbart News’ larger political polling initiative. "On the question if this is normal behavior or bias, regardless of how you vote, 64 percent of people have an opinion on this, with about 21 percent undecided," he said. The majority believe the bias is "so incredible that it constitutes a threat to the people’s right to know, and it’s a threat to democracy," concluded Caddell, calling it "terrifying.
