Actress Salma Hayek cut a   encouraging Latino voters to head to the polls in November and to vote for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. ["To all Latinos in the United States of America: We cannot allow them to insult and abuse us anymore," the       actress said in the   ad released by the Clinton campaign Thursday.  Hayek says Latinos can show GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and the rest of America that there is a "mighty community" of active Latino voters. "The Latino vote is extremely important. We can prove that we are a mighty community. We have to vote. Vote for Hillary Clinton," the Sausage Party star said in the ad. "Also, those of us who can vote owe it to the undocumented immigrants who donâ€™t have a voice. " An outspoken supporter of Clinton, Hayek said in April that Clinton is the "only person" who can lead the fight against ISIS. A constant critic of Republican candidate Donald Trump, the   actress recently offered to lend Trump a copy of U. S. History for Dummies.  "Mr. Trump, I recommend to you to read this book," Hayek said during an August appearance on The Late Late Show With James Corden. "I will gladly lend you my copy," she added while holding up a copy of the book.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
