’  ’ "   The FBI reportedly rejected a White House request to debunk   stories about alleged communications between Russian operatives   and people within President Donald Trump’s inner circle,  on Thursday evening. " ’   Trump administration officials wanted the FBI to disavow the   reports and say that there was no contact between people   associated with Trump and Russia, the network said, citing   multiple US officials familiar with the discussions. ’ ’   According to one unnamed   official, the   conversations began with White House chief of staff Reince   Priebus and FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe one day after the   stories were published. FBI director James Comey reportedly   barred the agency from weighing in on media reports, CNN said,   citing its sources. ’ ’   White House officials denied suggestions that it tried to goad   the FBI into debunking news reports, CNN said. Additionally, the   Trump administration has forcefully rejected allegations of   contact with the Kremlin  —   and  for using   anonymous sources in their reporting. ’ ’   A bombshell report from The New York Times and CNN last week   asserted that during the US election, the Trump campaign . ’ ’   Citing US   and intelligence agencies, The Times   said in its report that the contact between Trump associates and   Russian officials was discovered during a concurrent FBI   investigation into cyberattacks the US has said Russia carried   out targeting Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National   Committee. ’ ’  ’ "   Paul Manafort, a former campaign manager to Trump who was also an   adviser to a   political party in Ukraine, was the only   American named in The Times’ report on February 14.
