Iowa GOP state Chairman Jeff Kauffman called in as a guest on "The Cats Roundtable" on New York’s   on Sunday.  He told show host John Catsimatidis GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz’s opposition to ethanol is a definitely a "factor" with Iowa voters. "It’s an important issue out here. I don’t think it’s an issue that will sink or allow one candidate to rise necessarily, but, I mean, it is a factor. Everybody has an opinion out here. If Senator Cruz wants to explain his position, and I know he has an explanation for that, he can take it right to the people out here, and I’m guessing that he will. " Kaufmann was then asked who would win the election if it was tomorrow, but he refused to answer, only saying Cruz and Donald Trump both have the "inside track.
