More than 4, 500 people gathered in Tampa, Florida, at a Donald Trump campaign rally on Saturday morning, where the Republican nominee touted several polls that show him tied or leading his opponent, Hillary Clinton. ["We don’t have enough time to talk about it now," Trump said about the recent polls that are favorable to him. "There’s too many of them. "  "We’re killing them in Texas," he added, mocking pundits who claimed Texas was a state in play for Democrats this election. "I think we’re going to win Pennsylvania," Trump continued, after telling the crowd that he is doing well in North Carolina and Ohio: @realDonaldTrump in Tampa #FL: "we are doing well in   Democratic strongholds. We are going to Minnesota" (CO, MI WI PA NH NV)  —   Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 5, 2016,  Trump announced on stage that he is going to go to Minnesota before Election Day,  —   Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) November 5, 2016,  Although Trump said he was going to Minnesota, no campaign rally is scheduled there ahead of the election, according to Trump’s campaign website schedule, which has him traveling to Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire —  all before Tuesday. "I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we are about to say. When we win on November 8, we are going to drain the swamp," Trump declared, before continuing to discuss rising Obamacare premiums, job numbers, and trade. Trump’s campaign rally in Tampa was his first of four events, as he is also holding campaign rallies in North Carolina, Nevada, and Colorado on Saturday.
