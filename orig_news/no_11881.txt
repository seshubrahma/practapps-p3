Tuesday on "Fox  Friends," Republican presidential   Donald Trump continued his attacks on his opponent Sen. Marco Rubio ( ).  Trump, who is up by     points over Florida’s junior senator according to the the Real Clear Politics average, expressed his skepticism of Rubio’s electoral chances in his home state. "Little Marco Rubio, let me tell you  —   he’s been a disaster for Florida," Trump said. "Doesn’t show up to vote. He’s got the highest miss record in the United States Senate.
