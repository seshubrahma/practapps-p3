The White House issued a statement vowing to file for an emergency stay of a federal judge’s order to block President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting immigration and refugees from high risk countries from the Middle East. ["At the earliest possible time, the Department of Justice intends to file an emergency stay of this order and defend the executive order of the President, which we believe is lawful and appropriate," read a statement from Sean Spicer to reporters.  The statement explained that Trump’s order was issued under his constitutional authority to protect the American people. U. S. District Court Judge James Robart took the unusual step of issuing a emergency stay of Trump’s order as the attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota filed a lawsuit to overturn the legislation. The plaintiffs argue that Trump’s order violates the U. S. Constitution and federal law, including what they say is discrimination against a particular religion. But Trump defied the order, sending a message on Twitter on Saturday. "The opinion of this   judge, which essentially takes   away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!" he wrote.
