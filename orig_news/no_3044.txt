President Donald Trump reacted to the massive rioting at   in response to a scheduled campus speech by Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos. ["If U. C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view  â€”   NO FEDERAL FUNDS?" Trump wrote on Twitter early Thursday morning.  News of the rioting made cable news last night as students smashed ATMs and bank windows, looted a Starbucks, beat Trump supporters, pepper sprayed innocent individuals, and set fires in the street. Others spray painted the words "Kill Trump" on storefronts. The speech was canceled by   police as security failed. Yiannopoulos was evacuated from the area. "The left is profoundly antithetical to free speech these days, does not want to hear alternative points of view, and will do anything to shut it down," Yiannopoulos told Fox News host Tucker Carlson in an interview on Wednesday night. "My point is being proven over and over and over again. "
