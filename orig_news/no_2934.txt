" A   tabloid said his grasp of foreign policy was "like a child. " Our reporter analyzed five ways the Chinese could make life difficult for a Trump administration. Mr. Trump also faces a domestic split. Prominent Republicans are calling for investigations into intelligence findings that Russian cyberattacks supported Mr. Trump’s presidential bid, an assessment he has dismissed.

" The photographer Ashley Gilbertson wrote those words after spending a week with our   columnist Roger Cohen, documenting the misery of asylum seekers detained at Australia’s request on a remote island in Papua New Guinea.

S. stocks were lower.
