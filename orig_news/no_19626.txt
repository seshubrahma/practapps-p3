’  ’ ’   Despite the fact that he was  and  for his role in   sanctioning racial profiling, Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff   Joe Arpaio hasn’t gotten the message that he should go away.   Instead, he’s peddling more of the garbage that eventually led to   his downfall. ’ ’   On Thursday, "America’s Toughest Sheriff"  and announced that   President Barack Obama’s birth certificate is a "a fraudulently   created document that has been represented as an official copy of   the original. " ’ ’   Yeah, this birther crap again. ’ ’ ’ ’   Flanked by mustachioed Maricopa County Chief Investigator Mike   Zullo, Arpaio insisted he was not interested in where President   Obama was born (America) but rather, "we were going to   investigate a possibly forged document. " ’ ’   Citing nine points of alleged forgery in President Obama’s birth   certificate confirmed, he claimed, by two separate forensic   investigations, Zullo concluded that "we’re pretty confident with   these results. " ’ ’   Arpaio, one of the predominant figures in the   "birther"   movement that sought to discredit President Obama by calling into   question his citizenship, has long been an outspoken supporter of      Donald Trump,   who himself was forced, begrudgingly, to conclude in September   that, yeah,  (better late than never, I guess? ). ’ ’   According to Arpaio, the next step in his "investigation" is to   turn his results over to federal authorities. He declined to take   any questions. ’
