Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) is citing the Bible in his final push for votes before Monday’s Iowa caucus. [Cruz’s stump speech is by far the most religious one of all the Republican candidates, in which he tells his supporters to pray "each and every day" until the November election.  At a campaign stop in Hamlin, Iowa, before the caucus, he told supporters that it’s time to, "awaken the body of Christ that we may pull back from the abyss. " Cruz, who is polling second in Iowa behind Donald Trump, is relying on the evangelical vote to lead him to victory. His campaign has worked to secure endorsements from over 200 religious leaders. His strategy going into the early states has always been reliant on making sure he can secure as much of the evangelical vote as possible. In late December, Breitbart News reported Cruz’s religious pitch to his supporters going into the Iowa caucus, which is the same as his final pitch to Iowa voters. "If we awaken and energize the body of Christ  —   if Christians and people of faith come out and vote our values  —   we will win and we will turn the country around," Cruz told supporters back in December. "We’re working to have a lead pastor in each of the 99 counties in Iowa, 99 pastors are organizing other pastors," Cruz said. "We’re doing the same thing in South Carolina, organizing pastors in 46 counties to motivate and organize other pastors. " "I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming," Cruz said.
