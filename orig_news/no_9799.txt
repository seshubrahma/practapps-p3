Atlanta rapper and ardent Bernie Sanders supporter Killer Mike says the Republican party "created Godzilla" in Donald Trump" and "now he’s going to tear through Tokyo burning shit down. "["The Republican hate machine has been subtly feeding this monster," Killer Mike, whose real name is Michael Fender, said of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.  Killer Mike blames Trump’s political rise on "poor white people and working class white people" who have been told by the Republican party that "there’s somebody to blame —  except for us, except for government —  for everything in their life. " "Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O’Reilly: Congratulation guys, you created Godzilla," the rapper said while applauding the aforementioned media personalities. The son of a police officer, Killer Mike was labeled as "Bernie Sanders’s Unofficial Campaign Adviser" by the Daily Beast.  "He’s a critical part of the    socialist from a   state’s outreach to communities of color," wrote Asawin Suebsaeng. The Run the Jewels rapper suggests that those Americans who support Donald Trump’s temporary ban on Muslims entering the U. S. should "get out and befriend someone that doesn’t look like you. Go meet a Muslim family, go meet a Black family, go meet an Asian family. Start to get in other cultures besides your own. " WATCH:  Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
