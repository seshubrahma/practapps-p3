In contrast to the mayhem at DePaul University, Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos was given a hero’s welcome at UC Santa Barbara. [Before giving another talk as part of his college tour, Milo was lifted onto the stage via a golden throne, accompanied by music of "America Fuck Yeah" from the film Team America.  Milo’s throne was carried to the stage by a group of American men wearing caps bearing Donald Trump’s   slogan, "Make America Great Again. " Milo, whose talk was entitled "Feminism is Cancer," and was hosted by Young Americans for Liberty, opened the talk by saying that "I am finally entering in a manner I deserve. " Finally! @Nero gets the reception he deserves tnx 2 #UCSB Young Americans for Liberty. #Trump2016 #PresidentDaddy pic. twitter.   —   Robert Brown (@jerkstore66) May 27, 2016,  Unlike the chaos that took place at DePaul last Tuesday, dissidents were present at the event but queued peacefully and involved themselves as part of the QA when they were invited. A few students also congregated in a   protest outside the venue ahead of the event.
