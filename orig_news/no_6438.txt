S. military, respectively. [Mrs. Trump dedicated a new garden on the roof of the medical center, where she visited with children as they colored and enjoyed views of the National Mall and the Washington Monument.  When one of the children told Trump it was her birthday, the first lady shared that she had just celebrated a birthday and that her husband, President Donald Trump, is 70 years old and has a birthday in June, CNN reported. "The children all seemed to take kindly to the First Lady, and were pictured laughing and giving her hugs as they sat around the crafts table," the Daily Mail reported. "The group chatted about their favorite books and singers, and after several minutes of crafting, she thanked them for spending their afternoon with her. " The new Bunny Mellon Healing Garden is dedicated to U. S. first ladies and is named for Mellon, an American horticulturist, gardener, philanthropist and art collector who died in 2014.
