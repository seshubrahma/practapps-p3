Kenneth Vogel writes in Politico that   Trump faces "mounting questions about potential conflicts of interest between his vast business fortune and his incoming presidential administration. " [Some observers note that simply handing over management of his international business empire to his adult children or even putting his assets in a blind trust won’t be enough to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interests. Among those raising concerns is "Clinton Cash" author Peter Schweizer who argues that only a full divestment of his holdings can prevent Trump from being susceptible to the same kinds of foreign government influence peddling that plagued the Clinton Foundation.

"   …     Schweizer said Trump owed it to the voters who supported him to consider implementing "bright line" ethics rules. He acknowledged "to divest yourself from real estate holdings is not an easy thing, but I think it would be a very powerful thing to do and would send a great signal to the American people who are clamoring for somebody to clean up Washington, DC.
