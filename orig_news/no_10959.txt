On Friday’s broadcast of the Fox Business Network’s "Risk  Reward," Shawn Moran, the Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council, which has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (although Moran has said he doesn’t have a personal opinion on the race) stated, " "The Border Patrol has been turned into glorified Walmart greeters, and unfortunately, we are not being allowed to do our job. " And "We estimate that maybe we catch one out of three overall, but DHS likes to mess with the numbers, and use these complicated metrics. "  Moran said, [relevant remarks begin around 3:20] "The Border Patrol has been turned into glorified Walmart greeters, and unfortunately, we are not being allowed to do our job. The vast majority of the people that we encounter now end up walking out the front door of Border Patrol stations or even worse, they’re given money and bus tickets to go into the interior of the United States, and most of them will never show up for any type of immigration hearing. " He added that a 54% apprehension rate at the border "might be high. " Moran continued, "We estimate that maybe we catch one out of three overall, but DHS likes to mess with the numbers, and use these complicated metrics. The most important thing is how many people are getting away from us, and that’s a number they don’t like to disclose, because it shows just how ineffective we’re being, because we’re restricted by policy and we’re not allowed to go do our jobs.
