On Thursday’s broadcast of CNN’s "The Lead," CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said that during her press conference earlier that day, Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton "didn’t really want to be there. "  Gergen said, "What also struck me, Jake, about her appearance was how subdued she was with the press. I had the sense she didn’t really want to be there. But it also  —   you also had the sense, I did at least, that she’s still recovering. She didn’t bring that zest to today that she has, but she did aim a very   dart against Trump over that black woman pastor in Flint, and I think elevated that story so it will get more attention now in the national press in the next 24 hours.
