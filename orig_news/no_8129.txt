Donald Trump fired back at George Clooney on Friday in response to the actors’s prediction this week at the Cannes Film Festival that "there will never be a President Trump. "["As far as George Clooney is concerned, let’s put it this way  —   he’s no Cary Grant," Trump said in an interview on Fox and Friends on Friday morning.   During a Cannes press junket for his latest film Money Monster on Thursday, Clooney told a room full of international reporters that Trump will never be elected president. "That’s not going to happen," Clooney said to applause. "Fear is not going to be something that drives our country," Clooney said. "We’re not going to be scared of Muslims or immigrants or women. We’re not actually afraid of anything. We’re not going to use fear. So that’s not going to be an issue. " Clooney also said that Trump’s popularity is a result of a   cable news media that doesn’t ask the GOP frontrunner tough questions. "Well, at least he’s right about the ratings  —   that’s the good news," Trump countered. "I think I get asked the toughest questions on Earth. I mean, I will tell you, nobody asks tougher questions than they do to me. It’s all ‘gotcha.’ Even you guys every once in awhile get awfully tough, but that’s okay.
