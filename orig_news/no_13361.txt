The White House appeared unimpressed by the news that Carrier had decided not to move 1, 000 manufacturing jobs to Mexico, after negotiating with   Donald Trump about keeping the jobs in Indiana. [White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest admitted that Carrierâ€™s decision appeared to be "good news" but pointed out that Obama had done a better job at creating and saving jobs.  "If he is successful in doing that 804 more times, then he will meet the record of manufacturing jobs that were created in the United States while President Obama was in office," he said. Earnest pointed out that under Obama, 805, 000 manufacturing jobs were created in the United States. He also boasted that Obama had saved over a million jobs during his presidency by bailing out the auto industry. "President Obama has set a high standard, and   Trump can meet that standard, if this Carrier deal is completed in the way that he expects that it will be," he said. "If he does that 804 more times, then he will match the standard established by Obama. "
