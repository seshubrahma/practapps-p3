New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has hired two fundraisers from Florida, a sign he may be working toward a presidential bid, the New York Post reported. [One of the consultants he hired is former Hillary Clinton fundraiser Jon Adrabi, who "will help plan events and build relationships with Democratic donors in the key swing state. "  "Hiring    fundraising staff, particularly in a battleground state, opens up money spigots beyond what would normally be available and is a key first step to laying the groundwork for a run," a Democratic operative told the Post. The source says that Cuomo wants to "hire political consultants with experience outside of New York. " Cuomo is planning several fundraisers next month to add to the $22 million he already has. One of those events includes "a dinner at the St. Regis where tickets cost $15, 000 per person," and "sources say a South Florida event is also in the works. " Cuomo has become very vocal about issues in the Trump administration, further "expanding his national profile. " He announced a plan to fight antisemitism and hate crimes, spoke out against Trumpâ€™s executive order on immigration, and vowed to protect transgender students in New York after the Trump administration repealed guidelines allowing students to use the bathroom of their preferred gender identity.
