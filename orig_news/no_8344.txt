Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is scheduled to be in Washington, D. C. on Sunday to attend the Memorial Day event with Rolling Thunder. ["I am doing it in honor of the great bikers who have been totally supportive of my campaign, and now I want to be supportive of them," Trump told Bloomberg Politics. "I look forward to it!"  "The bikers love Trump," Trump touted previously on the campaign trail. "Iâ€™m not a huge biker. I have to be honest with you, okay? I always liked the limo better. " The "Ride for Freedom" intends to raise awareness for American Prisoners of War and warriors who are currently Missing in Action, according to USA Today. Trump is scheduled to speak at the event Sunday afternoon.
