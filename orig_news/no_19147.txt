’  ’ ’   Republican Sen. David Perdue of Georgia told Business Insider on   Monday that the battle over the government spending bill is "one   reason why Donald Trump is doing so well." ’ ’   On Tuesday, the  to reject a spending bill to   fund the government through early December by a   vote, far   short of the 60 needed to pass. ’ ’   If no extension is passed by the end of the week, there will be a   partial shutdown of the federal government. ’ ’   Senate Democrats have said they will refuse to back a bill that   provides disaster relief to Louisiana but not to Flint, Michigan   for its water crisis. ’ ’   A total of 13 Republicans, including Perdue, Sen. Ted Cruz of   Texas and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, joined the   Democrats in opposing the bill Tuesday. ’ ’’ ’   Speaking in Hempstead, New York, before the first presidential   debate at Hofstra University, Perdue said Monday that he’’s   "outraged" an agreement on funding the government for the near   future has not been met. But, he did say he’’s sure a bill will   get passed this week. ’ ’   "I mean, neither side benefits from a day past the end of the   fiscal year," he said. "I will say there are political games   going on to keep Republican senators who are running for office   in Washington longer than they need to be." ’ ’   "We should’’ve done this last week," he continued. "Actually, this   whole thing should’’ve been done back in July to be honest with   you." ’ ’   The Georgia Republican said this is an example of the "political   insider games" that "outrages people back at home." ’ ’   "It’’s one reason why Donald Trump is doing so well," he said. ’
