Asked about   Donald Trump’s recent phone call with Taiwan, which caused quite a fuss in media and political circles, former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday, "It was absolutely the right thing to do. "["Taiwan has been a friend and ally of the United States," continued Bolton. "We have treated them very badly over the years," he added, citing "a long list of the ways we have mistreated them. "  Bolton said he thought Washington was upset about the call, in large part, because Trump did it without consulting the State Department. "This man thinks for himself," he said. As for America’s One China policy, "It absolutely is not a violation of the One China policy," insisted Bolton. "Moreover, as significant and beneficial as I think the call was, it doesn’t necessarily foretell what comes next. There’s no inevitability here. People ought to chill out a little bit, calm down and see what happens. " Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
