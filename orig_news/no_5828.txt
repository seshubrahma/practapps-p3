As Californians woke up to the news of the shooting attack on Republican members of Congress in Alexandria, Virginia, reactions were already pouring in from many of California’s top elected officials. [Top Democrats who have been the most vociferous critics of President Donald Trump and his policies abandoned their fiery "resistance" rhetoric and expressed uniform outrage at the shooting and sympathy for the victims.  As of 8:30AM PDT, neither California’s Governor Jerry Brown (nor Assembly Speaker Rendon ( ) had posted an official comment on their Facebook or Twitter accounts, but the responses from the rest of California’s top political leaders were virtually indistinguishable by party: Rep. David Valadao ( ) who reportedly skipped the Republican Congressional baseball practice session in preparation for Thursday’s game, focused his comments solely on his wounded colleague, Rep. Steve Scalise: "Praying for @SteveScalise and staff injured in this morning’s tragic incident. Thankful for our brave @CapitolPolice.

" She also stated: "This morning, the U. S. Congress suffered a despicable and cowardly attack.  My thoughts and prayers are with Whip Steve Scalise and the others wounded, Capitol Police and staff, and their families.
