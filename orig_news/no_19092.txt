’  ’ ’   Former secretary of state Colin Powell is no fan of Donald Trump. ’ ’   In a slew of emails obtained by  Powell tore into the Republican presidential   candidate referring to him as an "international pariah" and a   "national disgrace. " ’ ’   In one email, Powell denounced Trump for perpetuating the   "racist" birther movement that questioned President Barack   Obama’s US citizenship. ’ "   "Yup, the whole birther movement was racist," Powell wrote,   according to the BuzzFeed News report. "That’s what the 99%   believe. When Trump couldn’t keep that up he said he also wanted   to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim. " " ’   In another exchange, Powell went off on media  —   echoing the   position of other lawmakers who believe the press helped fuel   Trump’s rise. ’ ’’ ’   "You guys are playing his game, you are his oxygen," he said.   "[Trump] outraged us again today with his comments on Paris     for police districts.
