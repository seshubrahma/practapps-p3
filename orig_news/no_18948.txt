’  ’ ’   Donald Trump has slammed President Barack Obama’’s statement on   the shooting of police officers this weekend in Baton Rouge,   Louisiana, and lamented that the US is "totally divided." ’ ’   Six   officers  and at least   three have died. The man identified by authorities as having   carried out the attack died in a shootout with the police, who   also detained two "persons of interest." ’ ’   "Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching,"   Trump    on Sunday after Obama’’s statement. "We are not looking good, we   are not looking smart, we are not looking tough!" ’ ’   Trump took a direct shot at Obama in a subsequent tweet. ’ ’   "President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn’’t have   a clue," Trump .   "Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get   worse!" ’ ’’ ’   In his statement Sunday afternoon, Obama condemned the recent   attacks on police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge and promised   "justice will be done." ’ ’   "There is no justification for violence against law enforcement.   None. These attacks are the work of cowards who speak for no   one," Obama said in the statement. "The officers in Baton Rouge,   the officers in Dallas  —   they were our fellow Americans, part of   our community, part of our country, with people who loved and   needed them, and who need us now  —   all of us  —   to be at our   best." ’ ’   Speaking to reporters later in the White House briefing room,   Obama struck a contrast with Trump by calling for unity and   warning against heated political rhetoric. ’ ’   "Everyone right now focus on words and actions that can unite   this country rather than divide it further," Obama said. "We   don’’t need inflammatory rhetoric. We don’’t need careless   accusations thrown around to score political points or score an   agenda. We need to temper our words and open our hearts." ’
