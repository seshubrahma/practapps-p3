Friday on MSNBC, Fordham University Associate Professor Dr. Christina Greer reacted to President Donald Trump’s White House counselor Kellyanne Conway saying that liberal feminists "have a problem with women in power,"  accusing white women of choosing "patriarchy over their own interests. "  Greer added that democracy "is set up to protect white women. " "Historically, we’ve seen white women choose patriarchy over their own interests," Greer said. "Well, this whole exercise of American democracy is set up to protect white women, so I think she’s problematic on a host of levels. And I wonder how long she’ll last.
