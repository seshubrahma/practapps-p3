Some time later, he asked her to meet him at     a hotel in Los Angeles for dinner. When he met her in his hotel     bungalow, "he came to me and started kissing me   as     he was pulling me toward him," she says. She pulled away and     sat on a chair, until he told her to sit next to him.   ’ ’     "He then grabbed my shoulder and began kissing me again very     aggressively and placed his hand on my breast.

"I pushed     his chest to put space between us and I said, ‘Come on, man,     get real.’ He, ‘Get reeeal,’ as he began thrusting his genitals. He     tried to kiss me again, with my hand still on his chest. "   ’ ’     Later, Zervos said, she got an offer from the company for a     job, but for much less money than she expected, and she wrote     him a letter saying she thought she was being penalized for not     having sex with him.

As with     other accusers, she says she was disturbed by the Access     Hollywood video from 2005 and by his  that he     has never touched a woman inappropriately.   ’ ’     "It wasn’t a sexual  . I don’t know why he did it. It was     like just to prove that he could do it, and nothing would     happen," she told the Post.   ’ ’Who: Natasha Stoynoff     When we found out about her allegations: Oct. 12,     2016     When she says it happened: 2005     What she says happened: People magazine’s      that she     visited    in December 2005 to interview Trump and his     wife, Melania, who was pregnant. While Melania was getting     changed, Stoynoff says, Trump took her to another room.   ’ ’     "Within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and     forcing his tongue down my throat," she says in an account of     the incident for People. Later, he told her, "You know     we’re going to have an affair, don’t you?" She told a colleague     after the trip and thought about reporting it, but she writes,     "I was ashamed and blamed myself for his transgression. I     minimized it (‘It’s not like he raped me  …    ’); I doubted     my recollection and my reaction. I was afraid that a famous,     powerful, wealthy man could and would discredit and destroy me,     especially if I got his coveted PEOPLE feature killed.

Do you     also remember when he then proceeded to have us lined up so he     could get a closer look at his property?   …     Oh I forgot to     mention that guy will be in the running to become the next     President of the United States. "   ’ ’     After some of her fellow beauty queens responded to the post,     she added in a comment: "He probably doesn’t want me telling     the story about that time he continually grabbed my ass and     invited me to his hotel room.

I thought, ‘Oh my God, gross.’ He was married to Marla     Maples at the time. I think there were a few other girls that     he kissed on the mouth. I was like ‘Wow, that’s     inappropriate. ’"   ’ ’         ’ ’Who: Jill Harth     When we found out: April 4, 2016     When she says it happened: 1993     What she says happened: Harth’s allegations appeared     first in a 1997 lawsuit and were surfaced first in the      then     again in the big May 14 New York Times .*     She says that when she and her partner worked with Trump on a     beauty competition in the early ’90s, he harassed her,     eventually escalating to what she calls "attempted rape. " In     July 2016, she told the  "He     pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me     and tried to get up my dress again   …     and I had to physically     say: ‘What are you doing? Stop it.’ "   ’ ’Who: Ivana Trump     When we found out: 1993     When she says it happened: 1989     What she says happened: During Trump’s first messy     divorce, Ivana alleged in a deposition that he assaulted her     when he was angry and in pain after undergoing a       procedure with a plastic surgeon she had recommended. In the     1993 book  Harry Hurt III described a violent episode.     "According to versions she repeats to some of her closest     confidantes, ‘he raped me,’ " Hurt wrote. Ivana later walked     this back, saying in a statement included in Lost     Tycoon, "I referred to this as a ‘rape,’ but I do not want     my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense. "   ’ ’  ’ ’     The Trump campaign, of course, is denying all of the new     accusations and is reportedly  by     introducing new women who say Bill Clinton violated them. "With     rape culture being what it is, these facts are going to shock     millennial women. There will not be a millennial woman who will     want to vote for her when these facts come out," Trump deputy     campaign manager David Bossie told .   ’ ’     It seems more likely that more Trump stories are going to come     out, and that these stories will continue to portray a man     accustomed to abusing his power. "I was so upset that he     thought I was so insignificant that he could do that," Crooks     told the New York Times.   ’ ’     If and when new allegations come out, we will update this list.   ’
