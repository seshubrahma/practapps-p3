’  ’ ’   Just days after telling fans that he would have voted for Donald   Trump, Kanye West gave the public a piece of his mind again   on Saturday night, this time about politics, the music   industry, Beyoncé and Jay Z at the Sacramento, California, stop   of his Saint Pablo Tour. ’ ’   Captured on video by concert goers, West told the audience he was   "hurt" after hearing that Beyoncé refused to perform at the MTV   Video Music Awards unless she won Video of the Year over him, and   he also urged her husband Jay Z to call him. ’ ’   "Jay Z I know you got killers, please don’’t send them at my head.   Talk to me like a man," said West.  ’ ’   West said he was putting his life and career at risk by talking   to the fans in the audience "like this." ’ ’   Those in attendance said on social media that West then played   only a few songs before ending the concert, which began 90   minutes late. ’ ’   "The Saint Pablo tour is the most relevant thing happening. If   your old    keeps following old models, your    is going to get   Hillary Clintoned. You might not like it, but you need to hear   it," said West in the meandering rant where he also declared he   was "oh his Trump     tonight," as he bashed MTV and radio   executives.  ’ ’   "This is the future, this is the way of thinking to make America   great again," said West, though it’’s not clear what specifically   he was referring to.  ’ "   West’s representative did not immediately respond to request for   comment. " ’   Several fans claiming to have been at the show took to social   media to express their dissatisfaction with the shortened show,   and the hashtag #KanyeIsOverParty began trending on Twitter on   Sunday. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tSo  sang 2 songs and took my money! !’t’t’ ’ ’ ’ The Associated Press contributed to this report. ’
