Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who’s endorsed Donald Trump, is in Wisconsin campaigning for the GOP frontrunner. [Palin posted on Facebook, "Just touched down in the great state of Wisconsin to ‪#‎Stump4Trump‬! Wisconsin’s middle class has been hurt by DC politicians’    policies worse than any other state  —   100, 000 jobs lost to Mexico and China thanks to trade deficits with countries that cheat on our ‘agreements. ’"  Donald J. Trump has fought for American workers and against trade deficits for decades in the private sector, unlike his competitors who actually support Obama’s reckless TPP and TPA deals that are entirely unfair to the U. S. worker! As President he’ll bring manufacturing jobs back home his interests are OUR interests, and his trade policies will finally put America first. Watch this clip of Donald Trump 20 years ago standing up for American workers! ‪#‎jobs‬ #jobs #jobs, As Palin is campaigning for Trump, the real estate mogul added two new campaign events to his schedule. He originally planned an afternoon town hall in Wausau, Wisconsin on Saturday, but is now also holding a town hall earlier in the day in Racine, Wisconsin and also a town hall Saturday night in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. His new events come as a new poll shows Trump trailing Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) in the important swing state.
