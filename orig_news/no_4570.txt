S.  border and enforcing the immigration laws already on the books. President Trump also signed an order suspending the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days, which prohibits the arrival of refugees into the United States during that period while the refugee vetting process is being reviewed. Sunday wasn’t the first time that the Hadid name was linked to Trump. Gigi Hadid faced fierce backlash last November over what critics called a "disgraceful" and "disrespectful" impression of First Lady Melania Trump during the American Music Awards. After Trump was elected, however, the    model told the Associated Press that "honestly, as a country, we have to give [Trump] a chance because that’s what our country voted for and that’s what we accept as citizens in this country.
