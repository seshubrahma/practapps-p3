Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) A couple of months ago, then   Kamala Harris appointed Julie Chavez Rodriguez to be her state director, overseeing operations in California. Ms. Rodriguez, 38, would "give voice to our vulnerable communities," Ms. Harris said at the time. Ms. Rodriguez had experience. Her most recent job was in the White House serving as senior deputy director of public engagement and special assistant to President Barack Obama. But she also brought a personal connection to politics  —   she is the granddaughter of Cesar Chavez, the great labor leader for farmworkers. Raised in the Central Valley, Ms. Rodriguez was surrounded by activism. Once, at age 9, she was arrested during a protest outside a supermarket while distributing fliers about pesticide risks. Ever since, those battles have shaped her path, she said. We caught up with Ms. Rodriguez by phone. Some excerpts from the conversation: • Tell me about your gig.

[San Luis Tribune] Mayor Ed Lee announced Monday that San Francisco’s main community college would be tuition free for city residents. "When our city works together we can accomplish great things," he said during a news conference. To pay the cost to City College of San Francisco, the city will draw from the increase of a real estate transfer tax that voters approved in November. Lately, California has seen a spike in programs offering support to community college students, propelled in part by a nationwide push to improve access to higher education. In November, a coalition of education leaders in the San Joaquin Valley introduced an initiative that would provide a free semester of community college to students who meet certain academic goals. City College of San Francisco, founded in 1935, serves about 60, 000 students. Until now, course costs for city residents have run $46 a unit, or roughly $1, 100 a year. Even with that expense waived, students will still have to figure out their living costs. In San Francisco, that’s no small order. California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays.
