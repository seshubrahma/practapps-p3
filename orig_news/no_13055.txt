Friday at a rally for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Coral Springs, FL, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was "ugly" on the inside.  Wasserman Schultz said, "I have a few thoughts about Donald Trump’s appearance but I’m going to keep those thoughts to myself, for two reasons. First of all you could put all the fashion experts and stylist in the world to work for Donald Trump and he still couldn’t win a beauty contest. Wait, wait  —  I want you to understand what I mean, not in this universe. Because you  can’t fix ugly when it is on the inside. Am I right? Am I right? You can’t fix ugly when it is on the inside.
