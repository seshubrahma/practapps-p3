’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’ ’ ’Wow watch Shepard Smith’s reaction to Trump’s "fake news" claims at press conference ’ "   Smith’s comments came after Trump’s  on Thursday afternoon, during   which the president repeatedly sparred with reporters and   accused the media of treating his administration unfairly. While   Trump said he had no contact with Russian officials during the   campaign, he did not respond directly to questions posed by   Acosta and other reporters concerning whether any of his advisers   had.  " ’   "It’’s crazy what we’’re watching everyday. It’’s absolutely crazy,"   Smith said. "He keeps repeating ridiculous throwaway lines that   are not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of   Russia as if we’’re some kind of fools for asking the   question."  ’ ’’ ’   Turning to face the camera   Smith addressed Trump   directly, "We are not fools for asking this question and we   demand to know the answer to this question. You owe this to the   American people," he said. "If your people were on the phone with   [the Russians] what were they saying? We have a right to know   . .. The people deserve that answer, at very least." ’ ’Fox News host Shepard Smith. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
