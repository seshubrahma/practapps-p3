’  ’ "   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer revamped a 2009 letter from   Mitch McConnell to Harry Reid in an attempt to make a point about     Donald Trump’s upcoming Cabinet confirmation   hearings. " ’   Schumer, a Democrat from New York, wrote on Twitter that   Democrats’’ requests regarding the Cabinet appointments are   "eminently reasonable" and "shared by leaders of both parties." ’ ’   "I’’ll return this letter to [McConnell] with the same requests,"   he said. ’ ’   Schumer made only four changes to the letter, which he included   as a photo in the tweet  —   swapping Reid’’s name for McConnell’’s in   two places, subbing "Democratic" for "Republican," and crossing   out McConnell’’s signature at the bottom, replacing it with his   own. ’ "   McConnell, then the Senate minority leader, made eight requests   to Reid, who was then the top Democrat, regarding the hearings   for President Barack Obama’s Cabinet choices. Schumer was in   agreement with each point McConnell, the Kentucky Republican,   made. " ’ ’ " ’t’t’tOur requests are eminently reasonable, shared by leaders of both parties. I’ll return this letter to  with the same requests.  "
