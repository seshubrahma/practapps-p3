’  ’ ’   After Fox News anchor Chris Wallace received  for his performance as the moderator of the third   and final presidential debate, he reflected on the experience   Friday night. ’ ’   Overall, Wallace said he was surprised by the candidates’’   "distaste" for each other. ’ ’   "As Keith Jackson, the fabled football announcer, used to say   before a big rivalry game: ’’These two guys just plain don’’t like   each other,’’" Wallace said.
