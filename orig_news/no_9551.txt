In discussing the various scandals swirling around Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, former UN Ambassador John Bolton told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Matt Boyle, "Hillary’s campaign slogan might as well be Vote for Hillary Clinton  —   Not Indicted, Yet! "[Bolton also discussed the lengths to which most must go to perform government service at the level Hillary Clinton did, but those rules seemingly did not apply to her. He said:  In all the administrations I’ve served in, when you go into the government in a senior position, it’s like going into a monastery. You have to cut off ties, not only business ties from the public sector, but resign from boards of charitable organizations. It’s really a very draconian step you have to take. It’s why a lot of people don’t want to go into government. But everybody does it, unless your name is Hillary Clinton. The former ambassador also discussed the vast differences between the anticipated foreign policy approaches of Clinton versus GOP nominee Donald Trump. He stated that there were plenty of conservatives willing to serve in a Trump administration, even if it were the so called Never Trumpers who were generating headlines. For his part, he said he would be honored to serve should the opportunity present itself. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
