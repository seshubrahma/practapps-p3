Brown says Trump raised these concerns before the elites and he’ll make trade deals that benefit working men and women and their families "right here in America.

He says some of the top executives in Trump’s organization are people who started out in   jobs but Trump saw potential in them. He says Trump sees potential in people that they don’t often see in themselves. He says other other executives ignore such qualities in favor of degrees from fancy schools.

She says she is going to violate that rule today at the RNC as a Christian woman. Gulbis says she has always wanted to own a Boys and Girls Club and felt that she was treated unfairly as a woman. Trump helped her open up her own Boys and Girls Club. Trump, she says, encouraged her to be "fearless" and to think of herself as a businessperson instead of a female athlete.
