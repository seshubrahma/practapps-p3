Donald Trump spoke Thursday on the "Hugh Hewitt Show" about his secretary of state selection, naming former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton as his potential secretary of state.  Trump was reluctant to name anybody now because of the heavy scrutiny they could face. Hewitt then asked about Bolton, and the GOP presidential nominee said he is a serious contender. "I think John Bolton’s a good man," Trump replied. "I watched him yesterday, actually, and he was very good in defending me in some of my views, and very, very strong. And I’ve always liked John Bolton. Well, we are thinking about it, Hugh. I will say that. We are thinking about it. I mean, the negative is what I told you. But we are seriously thinking about it.
