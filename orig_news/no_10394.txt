Jonathan Easley writes at the Hill:  Donald Trump hammered Hillary Clinton on trade and immigration at a rally in Michigan on Friday, as he made the case that Democrats’ policies have failed the black community. The speech was notable in that Trump used a teleprompter  —   something he’s done in the past for major policy addresses, but has rarely been seen at his massive rallies. He also used a prompter at Thursday’s rally in Charlotte, N. C. and the GOP nominee seems to be growing more comfortable reading from a screen. Some of Trump’s earlier speeches were stilted or stiff, but on Friday he was smoother and at times he left the script to improvise without going too far off track. "Hillary Clinton is a legacy of death, destruction and terrorism," Trump said, reading from prepared text. "America deserves a better legacy. All of you deserve a better future. I am the change agent. " The GOP nominee then broke from the teleprompter to personally address the crowd. "I am your messenger   …     nothing more than your messenger," he said. "It’s a message of strong defense, common sense, take care of our vets, great education, get rid of Common Core, great healthcare, get rid of ObamaCare, save our Second Amendment, which is under tremendous siege. Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo, or what we have. " Trump was dressed down at the rally, wearing a white "Make America Great Again" hat and no tie, noting that he was fresh off a plane from Louisiana where he and running mate Mike Pence had toured devastation from flooding in the state.
