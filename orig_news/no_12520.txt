[The show promises a "  " conversation with Trump that will focus on the "important questions that affect your health and the security of America," according to a press release.  The candidate will also weigh in on why health concerns have become such an important topic headed into the November presidential election, and Trump is also set to discuss his own personal health regimen. Trump’s rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in August to dismiss concerns about her own health, which she called part of a "wacky strategy" propagated by her Republican opponent. Clinton opened a pickle jar on air to prove her strength. Concerns surrounding Clinton’s health intensified last week after the release of FBI documents related to the investigation of the Democratic presidential candidate’s private email server earlier this summer. In one document, Clinton apparently told investigators she could not recall every briefing she received on handling sensitive material due to a concussion she sustained in 2012. "In December of 2012, Clinton suffered a concussion and then around the New Year had a blood clot," the FBI report stated. "Based on her doctor’s advice, she could only work at State for a few hours a day and could not recall every briefing she received. " In August, the Clinton campaign released a statement from her doctor declaring her to be in"excellent" health.
