Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump used Facebook to release a new ad yesterday warning that politicians are incrementally weakening the Second Amendment and pledging that he will not allow Americans to be disarmed. [The ad is titled "Second Amendment. " In it, Trump says:  So important is our Second Amendment. The politicians are chipping away at it day by day, night by night, [and] it gets weaker and weaker. We’re not going to let it happen. We are going to protect our Second Amendment. If I’m president, you can count on it 100 percent. Below the ad, Trump exclaimed, "I won’t let them take away our guns! !" This squares perfectly with what Trump has been saying through the primary campaign. Last April, Trump told Breitbart News (emphasis in the original): It is so important that we maintain the Second Amendment and that we maintain it strongly. And one of the main reasons is because the good people, the upstanding people, follow laws and norms but the bad ones don’t. So if the Second Amendment weren’t there to protect our rights and someone tampered with them, the good people would be affected but the bad people wouldn’t care —  they couldn’t care less. It is absolutely imperative that we maintain the Second Amendment in its strongest form.
