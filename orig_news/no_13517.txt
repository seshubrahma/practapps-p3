The Hillary Clinton campaign continues to raise the alarm about Donald Trump’s decision to hire Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon to his campaign, sending two fundraising appeals to her supporters in less than 24 hours. ["Never heard of Breitbart News?" a fundraising email from Clinton’s Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds writes. "It’s a fringe website where there’s no opinion too ugly, too divisive, or too outright crazy to be worth breathless promotion. "  The email tries to smear Breitbart as being racist,   bigoted, and promoting conspiracy theories. "They make Fox News look like a Democratic Party pamphlet," the email reads. "They’re a different breed altogether  —   not just conservative but radical, bigoted,     conspiracy peddlers who never have been and never should be anywhere near the levers of power in this country. " After begging supporters for money, the Clinton campaign admits that they want to put Breitbart News out of business entirely. "It goes without saying that we have to beat these people," Reynolds writes. "But I want to beat them so decisively that their kind never rises again. " The campaign even offers a free sticker(!) as an incentive to help defeat Bannon and Trump. "Please, chip in to stand on the right side of history and help us send Donald Trump and Steve Bannon back to the fringes where they belong," she writes. "When you do, we’ll send you a free sticker as a thank you for your support. "
