Sunday on CNN’s "Inside Politics," when asked about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton telling bankers behind closed doors that she wanted "open trade and open borders" according to transcripts of her leaked Wall Street speeches, Politico’s Glenn Thrush said, "This was really, really damaging stuff. "  Thrush said, "This was really, really damaging stuff. You can explain some of this away. She’s kind of said this in public in a softer way and other things she said. The most damaging thing I thought she said, just in terms of a sound bite if Trump were doing commercials was this notion that she could say things in private as a politician and then things publicly and have them be different. That confirms people’s worst fears about Hillary Clinton. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
