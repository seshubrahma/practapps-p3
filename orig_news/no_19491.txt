’   A    boy named Liam was behind the effort to surprise   Hillary Clinton on Thanksgiving Day with a series of colorful   signs posted near her Chappaqua, New York, home, . ’ ’   On Thursday, Clinton tweeted an image of the signs featuring   messages such as "  Hillary," "You are loved," and "An   American hero." ’ ’   "I was greeted by this heartwarming display on the corner of my   street today," Clinton wrote. "Thank you to all of you who did   this. Happy Thanksgiving." ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tI was greeted by this heartwarming display on the corner of my street today. Thank you to all of you who did this. Happy Thanksgiving.    ’ ’   It was one of her first tweets since conceding the election to   Donald Trump earlier this month. ’ ’   Liam had cheered Clinton on throughout her campaign and sobbed on   election night as he watched the results, his mother said. ’ ’’ ’   Over the next few days, he noticed that there was only one sign   near her home, which said "We love HRC," and thought there should   be more. ’ ’   "Liam said there ’’should be lots and lots of signs,’’ because   ’’she’’s probably even sadder than me,’’" his mother told friends in   a note inviting them to help make signs. ’ "   Clinton has largely remained out of the public eye since her   election loss, aside from a speech she gave at a Children’s   Defense Fund event one week after her concession. " ’   She has on several occasions, however, been spotted by her   supporters  —   first by a  then at a  and most recently at her  the day before Thanksgiving. ’
