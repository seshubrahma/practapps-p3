California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher discussed with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam Thursday the possibility of a "dynamic duo" of himself and former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton at the State Department if both are appointed in some capacity by   Donald Trump. [Rohrabacher responded, "I would think it would be very easy for us to work together. I would hope that we could be the dynamic duo that takes on these very serious and heavy problems and challenges we face not only around the world, but in cleaning up our own State Department, and John would be ideal for that. "  Several recent reports have hinted that both may be in consideration for major roles in Trump’s State Department: "Two sources late Saturday said that there is an emerging ‘consensus package’ of Rohrabacher, a   California lawmaker who heads a House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, as the secretary and Bolton as his chief deputy. " "John Bolton and I are very close friends, and I have admired him for years," Rohrabacher added. Rohrabacher was very critical of the State Department during the interview, saying, "Americans and our well being is not what’s first in their minds. " He pointed out their globalist approach that relies heavily on the United Nations and   solutions to every problem. He also said they have been relatively ineffective in fighting the war on Islamic terrorism, among other important issues. Recent reports have indicated Trump may be considering appointing both Rohrabacher and Bolton. Rohrabacher has already said he would be happy to serve in the incoming Trump administration and reiterated the claim in another recent Breitbart report: "Rohrabacher told Breitbart News that if Trump asks him to serve as secretary of state, he would give up his congressional career to join the incoming president’s team.
