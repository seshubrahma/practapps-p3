All the cable networks breathlessly covered former President Bill Clinton’s campaign stop Monday, and gushed afterwards about how much Slick Willy will help Hillary Clinton when it comes to putting her in the White House. For those of us who live in the real world, though, Clinton’s debut on the trail was a bit of a dud  —   except for the four females behind him who made faces throughout the entire ordeal.   According to the Daily Mail, one of the girls, 14   Mary, called Bill a "womanizer. " The Daily Mail grapped these photos and talked to the women, who said they were asked by the Clinton campaign to stand behind the former president: Former U. S.

He’s a womanizer.’ ‘I think that that’s his social life,’ the   said of the famous political Lothario. ‘And his work should be separate from that.’ Asked if she agreed, Deanne rolled her eyes left, then right, and sighed. ‘Um  —   I guess,’ she said at last. Bill’s speech lasted an interminable 28 minutes. Two words he did not speak were "Donald" and "Trump. " The Republican frontrunner spent much of the last week putting the Clintons on notice that any attacks on him would be met with return fire  —   up to and including the wake of women who claim to be victims of both Bill and Hillary.
