Thursday on MSNBC’s "Andrea Mitchell Reports," former Obama CIA Director and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said of Republican presidential   Donald Trump, there are no "details" or "substance" what he is pitching on the campaign trail.  Host Andrea Mitchell asked, "But in this case, do you think Donald Trump has a point, that it’s fair game if she’s going to make women’s issues an issue and if he’s a surrogate for her, is it fair game to go after Hillary Clinton as well as Bill Clinton for his past record?" Panetta said, "You know what, I would like to hear from Donald Trump a little bit of the substance of what the hell he’s talking about. He’s made a lot of comments about how easy it is to deal with ISIS, how easy it is to deal with a lot of the challenges that are out there. But I haven’t heard the substance behind it. I think that’s what we ought to be hearing more about. You know, personal issues, other issues, I know campaigns are going to get involved in those kinds of debates, but from the perspective of the American people, I think they need to hear what kind of substance, what kind of details, is the president going to actually provide as president of the United States, that’s something we’re not getting enough of.
