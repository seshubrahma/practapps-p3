Friday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," "Hardball" host Chris Matthews said support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is based on "the patriotic feelings people have. "  Matthews said, "Well a lot of this support for Trump with all his flaws which he displays regularly is about the country, the patriotic feelings people have. They feel the country has been let down. They feel that our elite leaders, on issues like immigration, they don’t regulate any immigration it seems or regulate trade to our advantage. They take us into stupid wars. Their kids don’t fight but our kids do. It’s patriotic. They believe in their country. " He continued, "It’s is a deep sense that the country is being been taken away and betrayed. I think that is so deep with people that they looking at a guy who is flawed as hell like Trump, but at least it’s a way of saying I’m really angry about the way the elite has treated my country   …     It’s a strong force wind of anger about the way the country has been betrayed. " He added, "Hillary is the symbol of the establishment. She is the symbol of the way things are headed. And they don’t like that. They are trying to ring the bell and say no and Trump is the only way to ring it. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
