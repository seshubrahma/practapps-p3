Monday on ABC’s "Jimmy Kimmel Live," Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton downplayed any concerns she had about forthcoming previously unreleased emails set be released by the State Department.  When asked by host Jimmy Kimmel if she were concerned about the State Department releasing emails before a deadline that falls right before a presidential debate, Clinton dismissed it as not being a problem. "Jimmy, my emails are so boring," Clinton replied. "I’m embarrassed by that. They’re so boring. So, I don’t know  —   we’ve already released   so what is a few more?" She went on to add she wasn’t concerned about her opponent Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump using them against her because "he makes stuff" to use against her anyway. "He makes up stuff to use against me," she added. "So, if he would stick with reality, I wouldn’t have a worry in the world. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
