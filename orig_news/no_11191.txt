Megyn Kelly’s   Fox special just got a little starrier.[  actor Michael Douglas and former O. J. Simpson "Dream Team" defense attorney Robert Shapiro will join GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump on the Fox News anchor’s primetime Megyn Kelly Presents program next month.  Douglas and Shapiro are the second and third additions to the program, after it was reported earlier this week that Trump would sit down for an interview with Kelly in what will likely be a ratings booster for Fox. "Mr. Trump and I sat down together for a meeting earlier this month at my request," Kelly said earlier this week. "He was gracious with his time and I asked him to consider an interview. I am happy to announce he has agreed and I look forward to a fascinating exchange  —   our first   interview together in nearly a year. " While few details are known about the special, Kelly will reportedly interview "celebrities from the worlds of politics, entertainment and other areas of human interest. " The Fox News anchor will also reportedly discuss her prominent role in covering the 2016 presidential race. The interview with Shapiro will be the first he has given since his depiction in the wildly popular FX television series The People vs. O. J. Simpson this year, where he was played by John Travolta. The primetime special comes as Kelly’s media profile has been elevated in recent weeks. The anchor was feted at Variety‘s Power of Women event in New York earlier this month and was featured on the cover of the entertainment trade’s April issue. In the accompanying interview, Kelly revealed that she is unsure whether she will remain at Fox News in the  .  Kelly also appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair in January and attended VF‘s   and   parties in February. Megyn Kelly Presents is set to air May 17 at 8pm ET on the larger Fox Broadcasting channel. Portions of the special will be replayed on Fox News’ The Kelly File.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
