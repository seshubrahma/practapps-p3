That will change very quickly under a Trump administration and it’ll change before it’s too late. "  "A cornerstone of my policy is we will substantially expand public private partnerships to maximize the amount of investment and funding that is available for space exploration and development. This means launching and operating major space assets, right here, that employ thousands and spur innovation and fuel economic growth," he continued. "I will free NASA from the restriction of serving primarily as a logistics agency for low earth orbit activity. " Announcing his plans to expand NASA’s mission, Trump declared: "Instead we will refocus its mission on space exploration. Under a Trump administration, Florida and America will lead the way into the stars. With a victory in November, everything will change. Just think about what we can accomplish in 100 days.

The magazine gave him a total of seven points for scientific policy, the least of all four main presidential candidates, while Clinton was given the most with 64 points.

Congressman Robert] Walker, is designed to coordinate public and private efforts to maximize American efforts to explore the entire solar system," wrote Coburn Palmer for Inquisitr.
