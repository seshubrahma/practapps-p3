Monday at the White House daily briefing when asked about Sunday’s Golden Globes remarks by actress Meryl Streep criticizing   Donald Trump, press secretary Josh Earnest said, "She clearly was delivering a thoughtful, carefully considered message that she believes in deeply. "  Earnest said, ‘I haven’t spoken to the president about her speech. I didn’t see her speech but I certainly  read about it. It seemed to get plenty of attention. I think what I can say is she clearly was delivering a thoughtful, carefully considered message that she believes in deeply. It seemed to me to be a fairly straight forward excise of her First Amendment rights as a citizen of the United States. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
