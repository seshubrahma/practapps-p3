He certainly doesnâ€™t speak like someone you would think of as a presidential candidate. Itâ€™s not just his Northeastern accent. He occasionally screws up with spelling and grammar. Trump gets mocked a lot for this. Especially on Twitter, and especially by people like me  â€”     members of the media elite. On Friday morning, Trump misspelled "honor" and "lightweight" on Twitter. The high priests of Manhattan media were almost beside themselves with delight. So let me say this in a way you elites can understand: As David Foster Wallace explains in a brilliant essay on English usage, there isnâ€™t just one "English. " As elite liberals are apt to understand in other contexts, what we call Standard English is really just one dialect of English  â€”   the English of rich, educated, largely white English speakers. There are many other dialects in English, associated with different regions, ethnicities, classes, and so on. Trump speaks the language of his voters  â€”   unlike other presidential candidates, and unlike people who go on TV to be professional pundits. And what does Trump tell these voters? That the elite are against them. That they despise them. And what do elites do? Prove Trump right by sneering at a Trump trait that he shares with many of his voters. Trump and his voters donâ€™t speak Standard English, nor do they speak its cousin dialect, Politically Correct English. As Mother Jonesâ€™ Kevin Drum points out, many people dislike political correctness, not because they secretly harbor bigoted views, or because they have a principled belief in a culture of free inquiry, but simply because Politically Correct English is a foreign dialect, which changes frequently and unpredictably. And if you donâ€™t always master its nuances, you might suffer withering social opprobrium. (Youâ€™re not exactly sure what gender to refer to Caitlyn Jenner as? You bigot!) As the French thinker Pierre Bourdieu pointed out many decades ago, such systems of etiquette often function as ways for the ruling class to control the ruled, enforce class privilege, and keep the ladder to the upper class nice and slippery. And this particular form of social control only seems to be exercised against one type of person. Trump connects with the white working class, with the socially downtrodden, with the frustrated and despairing, and with the poorly educated and financially struggling not in spite of his   manner of speaking, but because of it. The wealthy, urban elite ought to remember that before they turn Trumpâ€™s misspellings into a cocktail party punch line.

Through it all, Trump has dismantled the traditional rules that dictate how candidates are supposed to act and what theyâ€™re supposed to say. Heâ€™s adapted his campaign to a new era of communication and culture, creating something so new and disruptive that, regardless of how we feel about the man, we can only watch,   as the phenomenon grows and grows and grows. Trump has moved fast and broken stuff and never apologized. In other words, Trump has hacked the election. 4:30: When the media were saying that Trumpâ€™s criticisms of mainstream media reporters was "dangerous," one mainstream media reporter (Robert Draper) went against the grain.

Now, with Republicans voting in 11 states on Tuesday, the worst fears of the partyâ€™s establishment are coming true: Donald J. Trump could all but seal his path to the nomination in a case of unintended consequences for the party leadership, which vehemently opposes him. "Trump has significant advantages, and thatâ€™s the way the system is designed," said Joshua T. Putnam, a political science lecturer at the University of Georgia with an expertise in delegate selection. "Itâ€™s right in line with what the folks designing these rules wanted. Itâ€™s just not the candidate they preferred. " As the calendar flips to March, a whirlwind of states vote on the same days and in quick succession. By the middle of the month, 58 percent of the total delegates will have been awarded, and Mr. Trump could be unstoppable in getting the 1, 237 needed to clinch the nomination. 2:42: Washington Post finds Trumpâ€™s support increasing among college graduates  AND Tea Party voters (Trump accomplishing what the "smart set" said Rubio was best positioned to do):   2:35: Tight race in Texas: TEXAS POLL AFTER DEBATE Feb. 26th   ARG  Cruz 33%Trump 32%Rubio 17%@mitchellvii @laurenpaige1985https:  .   â€¦      â€”   Brad Trawick (@bradTmusic) February 29, 2016,  2:32: Good points about Romney.

Rubioâ€™s attacks may backfire because they go against the core of his brand and what his "politically correct" campaign had been about. He comes across as a desperate phony by completely flipping the image he had been presenting to voters on its head. Second, the new voters who are attracted to Trump will not be turned off by "nasty" politics and will vote for him. But the type of new voters Rubio must attract â€”  the more moderate and affluent voters in the suburbs â€”  may actually be turned off by such juvenile attacks. So while the GOP "smart set" on Twitter praise and stroke each other on Twitter, they may not realize Rubioâ€™s attacks may do him more a disservice in the end.

It may seem like an odd choice between candidates, but Ventura told The Associated Press on Monday that he sees echoes of his own underdog win for governor in 1998 in their campaigns. Ventura earned a spot in Minnesotaâ€™s political history books by winning the stateâ€™s highest office as a member of the Reform Party, a   organization later renamed the Independence Party of Minnesota. But for the political outsider, who is also a former professional wrestler, it all comes down to the influence of money in politics.

"And then weâ€™re going to head north. But at the end of the day, what changes this race is my ability to win in Ohio. And if any of these people canâ€™t win their own states, they probably ought to get out. We ought to consolidate the race. "   10:44  â€”   Massive line for Trumpâ€™s noon event in Virginia. Wow.

In his statement on Monday, Coburn said  Trump is "perpetuating a fraud on the American people.

Only 367, 491 people cast a ballot for either Clinton or Sanders on Saturday. Thatâ€™s down 16 percent from the 436, 219 people who came out in 2008 for Clinton and Obama. Factor in the 93, 522 people who voted for John Edwards back in the day, and you can see the scope of the problem. Democrats in 2016 are only getting about   of the primary votes that they received eight years ago. Republican turnout in the South Carolina primary, by contrast, was up more than 70 percent from 2008. South Carolinaâ€™s turnout numbers are not an anomaly. Theyâ€™re consistent with other primaries to date. Republicans are psyched. Democrats are demoralized.   9:16  â€”   Media mocks Marcoâ€™s gutter politics,  â€”   Next, Rubio will rip a fart into the microphone and say "thatâ€™s what Donald Trump sounds like" https:  .   â€”   daveweigel (@daveweigel) February 29, 2016,   â€”   9:09  â€”   WaPo  â€”   "The Republican Partyâ€™s implosion over Donald Trumpâ€™s candidacy has arrived" The implosion over Donald Trumpâ€™s candidacy that Republicans had hoped to avoid arrived so virulently this weekend that many party leaders vowed never to back the billionaire and openly questioned whether the GOP could come together this election year. At a moment when Republicans had hoped to begin taking on Hillary Clinton  â€”   who is seemingly on her way to wrapping up the Democratic nomination  â€”   the GOP has instead become consumed by a crisis over its identity and core values that is almost certain to last through the July party convention, if not the rest of the year.   9:04  â€”   Trump winning college grads,  â€”   Trump is backed by: 46% of college grad Rs51% of suburban Rs50% of Rs over $50K47% of Rs under 55https:  .   â€”   Greg Sargent (@ThePlumLineGS) February 29, 2016,   â€”   8:58  â€”   Divided GOP.

"A simple â€˜yesâ€™ would have worked," he wrote. "But on Sunday, Donald Trump swatted away the easy answers and instead feigned ignorance about the KKK and its most infamous Grand Wizard. The Republican frontrunnerâ€™s failure to provide what should have been a simple answer has raised even more disturbing questions about the man who is on course to lock down the GOPâ€™s nomination for president. "   8:12  â€”   Trump beats Hillary in New York. A publicly disclosed Siena College poll of Long Island voters last week found Trump narrowly beating Clinton among Long Island voters, 41 percent to 38 percent, while he was crushing his two nearest GOP primary opponents, Marco Rubio and John Kasich, by 37 percentage points each. 7:44  â€”   On the Today Show, Trump asks the key question, "How many times do I have to disavow David Duke?" Iâ€™m sitting in a house in Florida with a very bad earpiece that they gave me, and you could hardly hear what he was saying. But what I heard was various groups, and I donâ€™t mind disavowing anybody, and I disavowed David Duke and I disavowed him the day before at a major news conference, which is surprising because he was at the major news conference, CNN was at the major news conference, and they heard me very easily disavow David Duke. [Tapper] also talked about groups. And I have no problem with disavowing groups, but Iâ€™d at least like to know who they are. It would be very unfair to disavow a group, Matt, if the group shouldnâ€™t be disavowed. I have to know who the groups are. But I disavowed David Duke. " Prior to CNNâ€™s Jake Tapper asking Trump about David Duke on Sunday, less than 48 hours earlier, in a big news conference, Trump disavowed Duke. Trump also said that what threw him off was Tapper being unclear about "other groups. " 7:27  â€”   Trump hits 49% nationally in CNN poll. Marco Rubio sits at a paltry 16%. Cruz earns 15%.
