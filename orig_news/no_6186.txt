TBS’   comedy show Full Frontal with Samantha Bee issued an apology Thursday after a video segment mocked a conservative man for sporting a "Nazi" haircut when in fact he suffers from Stage 4 brain cancer. ["This year, the bow ties were gone, replaced by Nazi hair, Nazi hair, Nazi hair  …     and CPAC was decidedly Trump country. " a Full Frontal correspondent says in the video clip, as multiple images of young men with partially shaved heads appear on screen.  One image, however, showed Kyle Coddington, who, according to his sister, Megan, is suffering from "stage 4 brain cancer. " "When @iamsambee makes fun of your brother for having ‘Nazi hair.’ He actually has stage 4 brain cancer, but whatever floats your boat," Megan wrote on Twitter Thursday morning.
