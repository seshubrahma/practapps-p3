He says it has been a great night for Trump. And he points out that Rubio has been the donor class "favorite" and has won zero primaries and one contest. He says Rubio is "falling apart before our very eyes" and "that is a very significant development tonight. " Miller says it’s remarkable that Trump is on his way to the nomination while fighting the donor class and the power brokers every step of the way. "Historic achievement," Miller says. "That is a remarkable thing. " Miller says Rubio’s attacks are hurting Rubio. But he says the establishment machine still has considerable power and that is why   are not as supportive of Trump. Miller says we cannot overlook the fact Trump is in a strong position and just how "badly wounded  " Senator Rubio is going into Florida.

Trump says he thinks he will win before the convention. 11:15: Trump says he wants to be a more presidential candidate than Lincoln. He says he can’t just sit back and take incoming without attacking back and "I will do it for our country. " [Tony Lee: Again, Trump shows good instincts by saying he will fight for America like he has been brawling for himself. But he needs to put these messages together in a  better way so they cut through the filter. Trump’s challenge in the general election will be to be the "sensitive jackass.

But despite that, he says he has a "tremendous lead in Florida. " Trump says the biggest story is the tremendous outpouring of voters coming into the GOP. Cruz says he is honored to say that if he were not involved, that would not be happening. "We have a dynamic party. And as a party, we should come together and stop this foolishness," Trump says. Trump says he is not the "establishment" because he can’t be controlled. Trump says if the establishment runs a   candidate, that means that Clinton is going to appoint "very, very, very liberal judges. " Trump says he is the only one who can beat Clinton —  "if she is allowed to run. " Trump says I am the one person, "trust me," that she does not want to run against. 10:54: Trump says Rubio should drop out of the race. "I think it’s time he drops out.

His losses there may be blessings in disguise. Trump won’t be able to defeat Clinton by winging it though he can win the GOP nomination by making it up as he goes along. If Trump really fears being branded by history as a "loser," he must up his game in the weeks ahead to not only lock up the nomination but to train himself for the general election. Trump and his campaign need to anticipate   in advance that the media will use to trip him up and have disciplined answers at the ready. He needs to be more strategic. He has to understand the arguments being made against him on the right and the left and have counterarguments ready. Right now, Trump, who should be given credit for performing so well even though he has never run for anything before, is like a baseball hurler with unlimited talent who is just getting by because he can naturally throw gas. He’s a thrower right now. He needs to become a pitcher to beat Clinton.] 10:00: Scene at Trump’s news conference: View from front row of press section at tonight’s Trump press conference pic. twitter.   —   Jim Acosta (@Acosta) March 6, 2016,  Donald Trump just popped into his own press conference and then left.

She says she will work hard to bring back Michigan’s Democratic party and parties across the country. She talks about "inclusive" economics" and "inclusive" politics. That means, she says, supporting Obama and nominating   Supreme Court Justices. She says Justices need to expands voting rights, worker’s rights. She says "we have allowed our politics to be hijacked by extreme ideologues in state governments all over the country. " Clinton says the stakes keep getting higher while the rhetoric on the other side keeps getting lower. She says "you really want to pull your hair out" (would be quite something if she actually tried to pull out her hair) when you see the   from Republicans. Clinton says we have to "make America whole" again and says "diversity is a strength and not a weakness. " She says let’s try to find "a little more love and kindness in our hearts. " 9:10: Clinton projected to Win Louisiana. 9:05: NBC Calls Nebraska for Sanders. 8:50: Cruz officially wins Maine. Cruz gets 12 delegates. Trump receives 9 delegates. Kasich gets one.

He says Clinton voted for all the disastrous trade deals while he was on the picket lines opposing them. He also hits Clinton for her Iraq vote. And slams her for touting Kissinger’s praise of her.

He says Walmart workers need to get government assistance and taxpayers pay the bill. Sanders wants to thank everyone in the audience "on behalf of the Walton family" and says it is time for the Walton family "to get off welfare" and pay their workers more. Now Sanders says the "corporate media" want to talk about everything except for criminal justice reform. 7:18: CNN CUTS SANDERS OFF RIGHT AFTER HE RIPS HILLARY FOR WALL STREET SPEECHES: Sanders rips Clinton for giving speeches behind closed door to Wall Street. He says "I kinda think if you are going to be paid $225, 000 for a speech," it must be a brilliant speech you want to share with the American people. Must have been a "Shakespearean speech," he says. Where was this Sanders earlier in the campaign? [Interestingly, CNN, the Clinton News Network, cuts Sanders off as he starts attacking Clinton.] 7:15: Sanders gets primetime coverage as he speaks in Michigan. He blast the Koch brothers and a "few other billionaires" for trying to buy this election. Sanders says when you have a family spending more money than   that is not democracy, it is "oligarchy" and "we are going to stop them. " 7:01: Rubio underperformed in Kansas. Since it’s March Madness, Trump is like the college basketball team that doesn’t need to win its conference tournament to make the Big Dance. You get the sense that other candidates are like the teams that won’t get   bids if they don’t win their conference tournaments and every state going forward is a " " state for them.

He says he is the strongest conservative in the race. Cruz says Trump has the delegate lead but points out that he continues to rack up delegates as well. Cruz says he was second even in the places where Trump prevailed on Tuesday. He says what needs to happen is the field needs to narrow so Trump doesn’t have an advantage. Cruz says if you are not able to win states, there comes a point where candidates need to prayerfully reflect whether they have a path to win the nomination. Cruz says he is competing "vigorously" in Florida when asked if he will go for a "kill shot" (violent language!) against Rubio in Florida by a mainstream media reporter. 5:59: Cruz says he will unchain the free enterprise to grow the economy in order to defeat ISIS like Reagan disposed of the Soviet Union.

CNN cut away from it.  CNN and MSNBC live with Cruz Idaho speech.  Not Fox.  —   Chris Wilson (@WilsonWPA) March 5, 2016,  5:47: Cruz says the "scream" and "howl" you hear from Washington is utter terror at what "we the people are doing together. " He says the last two weeks have been extraordinary. Cruz said there were 17 candidates in the race a year ago and now Republicans, libertarians and men and women who love freedom and the Constitution are standing as one behind his campaign. He says everyone understands the countries at risk and our Constitutional rights are under assault each and every day. He says voters know America has receded from the world and the world is a much dangerous place because of it. Cruz says he is here with a word of hope because people are "waking up" all  America. Cruz says "jobs, freedom, and security" will be the three top issues in the election. He wants to talk to single moms who have been working more hours because Obamacare has reduced their hours. He wants to talk to men and women with callouses on their hands who have seen their wages become stagnant while the cost of living has gone up. He wants to talk to all the young people with student loan debt. Cruz blasts the media for saying this is the "new normal. " "Let me tell you that is an utter lie," Cruz says. 5:45: Cruz is about to address raucous supporters in Idaho. Good timing on Cruz’s speech. He’s looking like a winner tonight with some momentum.

He says if the establishment group, headed by Mitt Romney, starts to play games, they are sticking it to "you  …     the movement. "  He blasts the GOP "eggheads" who "cannot even tie their shoes" for slamming Trump on trade. "It has to be smart trade. It has to be even trade," he says.

" Trump says Forbes is undervaluing his net worth because he is friends with Romney. 4:20: Trump says the country has been so great to him that he is running to pay the country back.

It’s very real.  —   Dr. Milton Wolf (@miltonwolfmd) March 5, 2016,  2:40: At Trump’s rally, Stephen Miller (former communications director for Jeff Sessions) Trump’s senior policy adviser, reminds the audience that Rubio swore to fight against amnesty while running against Charlie Crist. But when he got to Washington, Rubio, Miller says, met with the special interests and the "rich and powerful who don’t care about you" to become the biggest champion of amnesty in the U. S. Congress. He says "Marco Rubio lied to every person in the state of Florida. " He asks voters to make Florida Rubio’s "Waterloo. " He says Rubio "sold his soul" to the   class. Miller is a very effective surrogate for Trump. Why is this guy not on television more representing the Trump campaign?  Miller rips Rubio for repeatedly saying that Rubio tried to get the best bill that he could. He reminds the audience that Rubio’s bill issued work permits to 12 million illegal immigrants to take jobs from every American, would issue 33 million green cards to immigrants in ten years, and made it easier to import unlimited numbers of refugees from the Middle East with no additional screening. He says Rubio’s bill doubled the number of   foreign guest workers. He says Rubio met with La Raza, Chamber of Commerce, Barack Obama, but he did not meet with law enforcement (law enforcement officers said Rubio treated them like "absolute trash") before he pushed for his bill that gave amnesty to illegal immigrant criminal rapists, etc. Miller says "Marco Rubio does not work for you. He only works for the special interests.

Gives standard stump speech to huge applause. "Young Americans won’t have a chance if the conservative movement is hijacked by somebody who isn’t a conservative," receives a standing ovation. CNN’s Dana Bash interviews Rubio  . The first few questions primarily and predictable center on Donald Trump and not Rubio’s Gang of 8 immigration betrayal. Why in the world would CPAC or Rubio agree to allow a CNN hack to depose our candidates? This is why we lose. Would Democrats allow Sean Hannity to depose one of their presidential candidates like this? Of note is the fact that while he referenced Trump in his speech, he never once mentioned Trump by name. Apparently, the ugly attacks Rubio launched against Trump either did not work or ran their course.   12:04  —   Sean Penn: GOP candidates make me miss George W.

They know what it is to be promised something and delivered nothing.   11:07  —   Latest poll out of Florida has Trump up only +5 over Rubio: 35%  —   30% A new poll by an   Trump group has found a narrowing Republican presidential race in Florida, suggesting the barrage of TV ads by the group and its allies might be taking effect. Trump leads Marco Rubio   percent ahead of the March 15 primary, according to the poll conducted for Our Principles PAC by The Tarrance Group, a Republican firm, and obtained by the Miami Herald. Ted Cruz drew 16 percent support, John Kasich 9 percent and Ben Carson 5 percent. (Carson formally dropped out Friday.) Six percent of respondents were undecided.   …     The new poll offered a glimmer of hope for Rubio in that he continues to have the most favorable rating among all the candidates. That gives him the most room to grow among undecided voters according to the poll, 24 percent of respondents are still picking a candidate. Sixteen percent are leaning toward one, and 57 percent have already decided. A big problem for Rubio, if this surge is real (as of now this poll is an outlier) is that more than a   votes were cast early while Trump was up 20 points. The story is a bit misleading. The poll was not done "by" an   it was done by a legit pollster on behalf of an   group.   11:05  —   How the GOP could stop Trump at the convention, Such a gambit would be chaotic and controversial, however. It would likely also face one large hurdle that needs to be removed before the voting starts. As things currently stand, only a candidate who has the backing of a majority of delegates from eight states can even make it onto the nominating ballot. The easiest way to acquire such backing is to win eight primaries. But at present, Ted Cruz is four states shy of that mark, Marco Rubio has won only one contest and no other candidate, barring Trump, has won anything.   10:54  —   Cruz: Brokered convention would lead to voter ‘revolt‘ Cruz is very smart to distance himself from those in the Republican Establishment looking to steal the nomination for Marco Rubio, someone rejected by 85% of GOP voters and who probably could win the presidency of his home state of Florida.   10:49  —   Trump accused of breaking Fox News’s debate rules.

Marco Rubio, it’s all about Florida" With Rubio’s presidential fortunes hanging in the balance, he’s focusing his time and money on winning his home state’s    primary on March 15. "Florida is the priority," Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Rubio will hold an afternoon rally Saturday in Jacksonville with New Mexico GOP Gov. Susana Martinez, a nod to the importance of Hispanic voters beyond Rubio’s   base in South Florida. Later that evening, he’ll travel to Puerto Rico ahead of the territory’s primary on Sunday. That could help him net valuable delegates and could resonate with Central Florida’s politically important Puerto Rican community.   8:47  —   Rubio: ‘Never Trump’ doesn’t mean I’ll never vote Trump, Sen.
