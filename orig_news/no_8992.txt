SANTA MONICA, California  —   During an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, former Mexican President Vicente Fox apologized Wednesday for the vulgar language he has used regarding GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s proposal to build a wall along the southern border and invited the likely Republican nominee to Mexico to see the border from the other side. [Earlier this year, Fox said that he would not pay for Trump’s "f*cking wall," and called Trump "Ignorant   …     crazy   …     egocentric   …     nasty   …     [a] false prophet. " Trump then called on Fox to apologize.  On Wednesday, he did so  —   in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News  —   and added that he wanted Trump to come to Mexico to see the border from the other side. "I apologize. Forgiveness is one of the greatest qualities that human beings have, is the quality of a compassionate leader. You have to be humble. You have to be compassionate. You have to love thy neighbor," Fox explained to Breitbart News while sitting in the hotel of the J. W. Marriott in Santa Monica, California on Wednesday afternoon. "Love your nation. Love the world," he added. "Yes, I’m humble enough as leadership be, [a] compassionate leader. If I offended you, I’m sorry. But what about the other way around?" "I don’t think he should follow the strategy of attacking others, offending others, to get to his purpose. There are other ways and means of doing it," Fox stressed, adding, "I invite him to come to Mexico and to see what Mexico is all about. " Fox stressed the important trade ties the two countries have, noting that the U. S. benefits from Mexican labor and has much larger trade deficits with other countries. He urged Trump to be more responsible, and suggested that he could help: "I can convince him to think intelligently" about trade and other issues, he explained.
