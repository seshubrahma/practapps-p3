’  ’ ’   Melania Trump is suing the Daily Mail and a Maryland blogger for   $150 million in damages over retracted stories that had   alleged that she worked as an escort in the 1990s. ’ ’   The suit came after Trump threatened legal action against several   publications that picked up the story, which was sourced to a   Slovenian magazine that reported that Trump once worked for a New   York modeling agency in the 1990s that provided escort services   to wealthy clients. ’ ’   A  from Charles Harder, the   lawyer representing Trump, called the allegations "100%   false" and "tremendously damaging to [Trump’’s] personal and   professional reputation." Melania is married to Donald Trump, the   Republican nominee for president. ’ ’   In addition to the Daily Mail, the lawsuit also includes Webster   G. Tarpley, a Maryland blogger, as a defendant. ’ ’   "Defendants broadcast their lies to millions of people throughout   the US and the world  —   without any justification," Harder said in   the statement. "Their many lies include, among others, that   Mrs. Trump was supposedly an ’’escort’’ in the 1990s before she met   her husband." ’ ’   The Daily Mail removed the story from its website and Tarpley   . ’
