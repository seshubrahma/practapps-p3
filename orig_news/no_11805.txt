Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, in a recent interview, brought up former White House aide Vincent Foster’s suspicious death, among other scandals surrounding Bill and Hillary Clinton in the 1990s. ["It’s the one thing with her, whether it’s Whitewater or whether it’s Vince Foster or whether it’s Benghazi. It’s always a mess with Hillary," Trump reportedly said in a recent interview, bringing up Foster’s suicide. Foster was a former White House aide and friend of Hillary Clinton. Trump recently said the circumstances around Foster’s death seemed "fishy," and allegations of foul play are "very serious. " "He knew everything that was going on, and then all of a sudden he committed suicide," Trump stated. Foster was discovered in a Virginia park on July 20, 1993, with a fatal bullet wound. Two investigations into Foster’s death yielded the same conclusion: suicide. However, newly discovered evidence increased belief that foul play was involved and resulted in an alleged coverup. The Washington Post reports: The real estate mogul and his allies hope that his tactics will bring fresh scrutiny to the Clintons’ long record in public life, which conservatives characterize as defined by scandals that her allies view as witch hunts. Through social media and Trump’s ability to garner unfiltered attention on the Internet and the airwaves, political strategists believe he could revitalize the controversies among voters who do not remember them well or are too young to have lived through them. "The Clintons collectively have dodged many, many, many bullets. So much that was suppressed [by the media] is going to get  . So many of the things that they slipped by on will get reexamined," veteran political strategist and friend of Trump, Roger Stone, stated. "That’s something they should have counted on before getting into the race. "
