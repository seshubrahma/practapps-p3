GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) appeared to walk back his campaign spokesman’s earlier comments about Gov. Sarah Palin’s expected endorsement of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump in Ames, Iowa on Tuesday evening. [Cruz posted on Twitter:  I love @SarahPalinUSA Without her support, I wouldn’t be in the Senate. Regardless of what she does in 2016, I will always be a big fan.  —   Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 19, 2016, Earlier Tuesday morning, Cruz’s spokesman, Rick Tyler, said he thinks endorsing Trump would "be a blow to Sarah Palin" during an appearance on CNN. Tyler said, "Because Sarah Palin has been a champion for the conservative cause, and if she was going to endorse Donald Trump, sadly, she would be endorsing someone who’s held progressive views all their life on the sanctity of life, on marriage, on   abortion. " "If it’s Sarah Palin, let me just say that I would be deeply disappointed," Tyler stated.
