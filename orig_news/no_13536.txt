Scott Baio has endorsed Republican frontrunner Donald Trump for president.  The    Happy Days and Joanie Loves Chachi star made his endorsement in an interview with Fox News’ Judge Jeanine Pirro on Saturday. "It’s very simple," Baio told Pirro of his reasons for supporting Trump. "Because when he speaks, I understand him. He speaks like I speak, he communicates with people very well. I want him, as any one person can do, to go into Washington and blow it up. " The conservative actor said he was "fed up" with the Republican Party, who said "lied and conned and BS’ed me," and added that he no longer considered himself a Republican but a "conservative Independent. " "They’re going to attack whomever the Republican nominee is," Baio continued, "and we need somebody to relentlessly, relentlessly, attack Hillary. It’s the only way we’re going to win. I’m trying to be a classy guy, but to win elections nowadays, the Democrats and liberals attack viciously. " Baio joins several other Hollywood figures who have thrown their support behind Trump, including actor Jon Voight, Duck Dynasty‘s Willie Robertson, singers Kid Rock, Loretta Lynn and Aaron Carter and former boxer Mike Tyson. Baio added that he likes Trump’s rivals for the GOP nomination, Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich, but he doesn’t think they "have the wherewithal to fight back" against Clinton. In March of last year, Baio endorsed Scott Walker when the Wisconsin governor was still in the presidential race.
