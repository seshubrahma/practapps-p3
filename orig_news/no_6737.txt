"We’re gonna be lowering taxes big league, we’re going to be getting rid of regulations that are unnecessary big league," he said. Trump met in the Oval Office with officials from Amgen, Johnson  Johnson, Merck, Celgene, Eli Lilly, and Novartis. After their meeting, Trump told reporters that he would oppose road blocks making it harder for smaller drug companies to compete with larger ones. He also accused Medicare of increasing the cost of drugs. "I’ll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing a product to a vibrantly competitive market," he said. "That includes price fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what’s happening. " Trump also promised to streamline the FDA, helping the industry approve drugs quickly. "We have a fantastic person that I think I’ll be naming fairly soon who’s gonna streamline the FDA and you’re gonna get your products either approved or not approved, but it’s gonna be a quick process," he said. "It’s not gonna take 15 years. "
