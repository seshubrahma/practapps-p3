On this weekend’s broadcast of on "Fox News Sunday," while discussing reports that he is not receiving daily intelligence briefings,   Donald Trump said, "I get it when I need it. "  Trump said, "I get it when I need it. First of all, these are very good people that are giving me the briefings. And I say, ‘If something should change from this point, immediately call me. I’m available on  ’s notice.’ I’m, like, a smart person. I don’t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years. Could be eight years  —   but eight years. I don’t need that. " He added, "Now, there will be times where it might change. I mean, there will be some very fluid situations. I’ll be there not every day, but more than that. But I don’t need to be told, Chris, the same thing every day, every morning  —   same words. ‘Sir, nothing has changed. Let’s go over it again.’ I don’t need that.
