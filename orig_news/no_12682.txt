On Friday, HBO’s "Real Time" host Bill Maher argued that "made a little sense to me" when Republican presidential nominee stated President Obama sounded madder at him than the perpetrator of the Orlando terrorist attack.  Maher said, "[T]he one thing that Trump said this week that made a little sense to me, he said, When, I listened to Obama today  —   and he sounded madder at me than the shooter. Couldn’t we just address the big elephant in the room, which is the shooter, before we go right to elephantphobia?" Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
