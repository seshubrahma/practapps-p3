Milwaukee County, WI Sheriff David Clarke spoke Friday on Fox News Channel’s "Hannity" about the media’s treatment of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.  "The liberal mainstream media is dwindling into irrelevancy," Clarke told host Sean Hannity. "Donald Trump understands this is a dragon that has to be slayed. The liberal mainstream media, these rags, realize that this is their last stand to have any influence over the American public as it relates to presidential politics. " Clarke then likened Trump’s response to the media to Muhammad Ali’s "  " strategy. "The media is pounding away, throwing everything they got like George Foreman was, and every once in a while Donald Trump look up, he smiles and says ‘is that all you got? ’" he said.
