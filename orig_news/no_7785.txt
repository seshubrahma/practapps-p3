A series of "flash mobs" for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will take place throughout Michigan August 30. [Trump supporters will gather at 13 different locations across Michigan on Tuesday Aug. 30 from 4: :30 p. m. to wave signs, flags, and other Trump campaign merchandise around to those who pass by.  The events are hosted by the grassroots group Michigan Conservative Coalition, a group committed to the principles of the founding fathers and the Republican Party platform. According to the group’s founder, Rosanne Ponkowski, the events are a fun way for volunteers to gather in support of the nominee. She also said the events are growing in number. "Each location will have a local feel unique to its community, but each site will show their support to elect Donald J. Trump during the same 4 to 5:30 p. m. time window," said Ponkowski in a statement. "Grassroots enthusiasm for the Trump campaign is driving even more flash mob sites. " The full lineup of events is listed on Michigan Conservative Coalition’s Facebook event page.   flash mobs have also been reported in Florida on Aug. 20.
