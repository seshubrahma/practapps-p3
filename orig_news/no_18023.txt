’  ’ ’   WASHINGTON (AP)  —   The biting humor of "Saturday Night Live" took   aim at another Trump this week  —   first daughter Ivanka. ’ "   The   comedy show skewered President Donald Trump’s   elder daughter with a faux perfume ad, starring actress Scarlett   Johansson. The name of the perfume? Complicit. " ’   As Johansson walks into an elegant party in a glittering evening   dress, the narrator says: "A woman like her deserves a fragrance   all her own. A scent made just for her. Because she’’s beautiful.   She’’s powerful. She’’s complicit." ’ ’   "She doesn’’t crave the spotlight, but we see her. Oh, how we see   her," says the narrator as Johansson applies lipstick and sees   Alec Baldwin playing Trump reflected back in the mirror. ’ ’   The narrator continues: "A feminist, an advocate, a champion for   women, but like how?" ’ ’   And concludes: "Complicit: The fragrance for the woman who could   stop all of this but won’’t." ’ ’   It was the first time Johansson portrayed Ivanka Trump. Actress   Margot Robbie depicted her in a sketch in the fall. ’ ’ ’ ’   Ivanka Trump was a popular surrogate for her father on the   campaign trail. She stepped away from executive roles at her     lifestyle brand and with the family business to move   her young family to Washington, D. C. when Trump took office. ’ ’   For now, just her husband, Jared Kushner, has an official   position, but Ivanka Trump has been an active presence at White   House meetings and has been advocating for several issues,   including for new child care policies. The extent of her   influence over her father behind the scenes has been the subject   of intense speculation. ’ ’   The White House and a representative for Ivanka Trump did not   immediately respond to requests for comment on "Saturday Night   Live." ’ ’WASHINGTON (AP)  —   The biting humor of "Saturday Night Live" took aim at another Trump this week  —   first daughter Ivanka.’ ’’ ’’ ’’
