PALM BEACH, FLORIDA —   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump says he and Rep. Paul Ryan ( ) will get along well if he becomes president. [Speaking from the white and gold ballroom at his    resort, Trump said that there will be consequences for Ryan if the Speaker chooses not to get along with him if he becomes president.  "I’m going to get along great with Congress, Okay? Paul Ryan, I don’t know him well, but I’m sure I’m going to get along great with him, and if I don’t —   he’s gonna have to pay a big price. " Ryan went after Trump this week and challenged Trump to reject groups like the Ku Klux Klan, who have expressed support for his presidential candidacy. "When I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and as a country, I will speak up, so today I want to be very clear about something," Ryan said.  "If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games  …    they must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry. This party does not prey on people’s prejudices. We appeal to their highest ideals  …    . This is fundamental. And if someone wants to be our nominee, they must understand this. " Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also blasted Trump this week. "There has been a lot of talk in the last 24 hours about one of our presidential candidates and his seeming ambivalence about David Duke and the KKK, so let me make it perfectly clear," McConnell said. "That is not the view of Republicans who have been elected to the United States Senate, and I condemn his views in the most forceful way. "
