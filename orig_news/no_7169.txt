Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump requested a moment of silence at the top of his speech Monday afternoon at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire for the lives lost during the terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida at the Pulse Nightclub. ["We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families," Trump stated. "We mourn, as one people, for our nation’s loss  —   and pledge our support to any and all who need it. "  "I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack," he requested. Neither President Obama nor presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton requested a moment of silence during their speeches on the terrorist attack.
