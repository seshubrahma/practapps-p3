Ask yourselves this: Are they good at combating   media on their turf? Nope. Democrats like Axelrod, Begala wipe the floor with these people. Are they good at appealing to young voters, urban voters, minorities? Do these people look like folks regular Americans would want to hang out with? Nope. None of these voters will take them seriously —  just like they won’t take "Reformicons" or Eric Cantor or Paul Ryan seriously. Are they good at understanding the concerns of the GOP base? Nope —  or they would have seen that Trump —  and his message —  would resonate a long time ago. So what are these hacks good for except being professional   tacticians? Notice the politicians that drive them the craziest are the ones —  like Dr. Ben Carson, Palin, Trump —  who don’t need them to be middlemen to get their message out to the people. These people are insecure to begin with and realizing that they aren’t even relevant anymore in politics just makes them angry. None of these people seem like they are content with their lives, so it must be even more upsetting to realize they no longer matter in the one industry in which they though they were relevant and in the "in crowd" of dweebs.] 5:49:   folks in the conservative industrial complex floating Rick Perry, one of the faces of the conservative industrial   as a possible   candidate.

" [Professional D. C. tacticians need to make money.] David McIntosh, president of the conservative Club for Growth, which has spent millions on ads attacking Mr. Trump, said his group met on Wednesday and concluded it was still possible to avert Mr. Trump’s nomination. The group plans a comprehensive study of Trump supporters to sharpen a message aimed at driving them away from him. 5:37: Seen at Trump rally: 5:15: Agitators chanting "Trump not welcome. " Protesters yelling "stand up for them" when speaker asks "what do we do when Muslims are under attack?" They are also chanting "Trump is a racist. And so are his supporters.

Steve Kerr was draining threes from the cactus logo. Sean Elliott led the team to the Final Four against Oklahoma (even Kenny Lofton was on the team). A decade later, Miles Simon, A. J. Bramlett, Mike Bibby, Jason "Socks" Terry, Bennett Davison, Michael Dickerson, et al. finally brought home a national championship. Nothing wrong with those days at all. I grew up in Southern California, but I’ve always rooted for Arizona basketball and thoroughly enjoyed visiting Tuscon.] 4:55:   Jonathan Chait harsher on   agitators than Ted Cruz, who blamed Trump first just like liberals blame America first for everything: Shutting down Trump rallies is a dangerous, illiberal    tactic. https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Jonathan Chait (@jonathanchait) March 19, 2016,  4:47: Video:     Chants from NYC Protesters,  4:39: Video: Protester Dressed as Trump Offers ‘Beat Up Trump’ for Cash,  4:08: From Breitbart’s Kassam: Dad tells kids: "look at [Veterans for Trump] in the eye  …     we’re gonna be fighting against them  …     KKK" #CrushTrump pic. twitter.   —   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) March 19, 2016,  4:00: Video from   NYC rally: Breitbart’s Lee Stranahan: Socialist "Minder" shuts down Breitbart interview: 3:55: Trump supporter at   NYC rally: (Photo: Raheem   News) This guy told me black people are being put out of work by Mexicans, that’s why he’s backing Trump #crushtrump pic. twitter.   —   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) March 19, 2016,  3:49: Ailes on Trump: Roger Ailes responds to   feud, says "we would welcome having Trump on the air" https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Hollywood Reporter (@THR) March 19, 2016,  3:39: Some Trump supporters had to walk to the rally because of the   agitators: Army vet who has a cane bc of nerve damage from when he was shot while serving walking to Trump rally. pic. twitter.   —   Seema Mehta (@LATSeema) March 19, 2016,  Trump supporters are now abandoning cars and walking three miles to rally. pic. twitter.   —   Seema Mehta (@LATSeema) March 19, 2016,  3:35: Kasich wants Senate Republicans to sit down with Obama’s Supreme Court nominee: Breaking: Kasich says Senate Republicans "ought to all sit down and meet with" Obama SCOTUS pick.

A few fresh faced young girls arrived, humorous signs in tow  —   ambling around looking for their supporters and friends. In the meantime, there were a handful of   people arguing with passers by. Police outnumbered protesters by noon by around 20 to 1. As time drew on, scores of people entered the circle, eventually taking over just one small segment of it, waving their banners and selling their badges labelled "DUMP TRUMP" and "SAY NOT TO CAPITALISM". While there were clearly many Bernie Sanders fans in attendance, the vast majority of those in attendance seemed to be   AND  . This is a hard line, revolutionary socialist protest. Chants included "refugees are welcome here"  —   exactly the same slogans you heard on London’s streets today, as the same type of left wing activists engaged in running battles with nationalist counter protesters on Oxford Street. Curiously, much of the protest in New York this afternoon revolved around a soccer team, with many of the organisers wearing "New York Cosmos" apparel and waving "AntiFa" ( ) banners. The early crowds were very clearly mostly people of Latin American backgrounds, chanting in Spanish, a bunches of young women wearing hijabs. Then came the revolutionary socialists. One woman told me she would abolish the presidency and have the United States run as a Soviet,   country. Others dressed up as death, the Statue of Liberty, and waved signs insisting that everyone was an immigrant once. "Fuck Trump," was a common catchphrase, as various speakers lined up with a small megaphone to shout in the direction of the crowd. Consensus appears to be that there were around 350 people on Columbus Circle  —   a busted flush when you consider the event had over 5, 000 confirmed attendees on its Facebook page. Journalists looked equally confused and disappointed, as did the rally goers whispering to each other: "We thought there would be more. How come there’s not more?" At the time of writing the protest is still on Columbus circle, and due to move down Central Park South towards the Trump Tower.  1:45: "Brandon’s life matters," she says. She also said that Trump has been a voice for "all of us who have had a loved one killed by an illegal. " She says no politician has "ever stood up for us. " She also said, "isn’t it time that out government gave a damn about Americans?" She says there are plenty of   programs for illegal immigrants but none for victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. #Trump Brandon Mendozas mom telling story of her son a Mesa police offer killed by illegal. #fox10phoenix,  —   John Hook (@JohnHookfox10) March 19, 2016,  #Trump in fountain hills.

The group states: Donald J. Trump has made headlines in recent months with his divisive rhetoric, hate speech, and extremist plans to "make America great again". We, in fact, believe this will do the opposite to this nation. Trump’s policies threaten many of us in the Black, Latino, LGBTQIA+ Muslim, and other communities. These policies and type of speech has no place in this country, and certainly does not have a place in the city that Trump grew his empire in —  a city known as a melting pot and home for many of the same people Trump continues to wage war on. Join us at Columbus Circle as we march to Trump Tower and say NO to hate, NO to divisiveness, NO to fascist policies, and most importantly, NO to Donald J. Trump.
