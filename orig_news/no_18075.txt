’  ’ ’   President Donald Trump is giving House Republicans an ultimatum:   Pass the American Health Care Act on Friday, or Obamacare stays. ’ ’   Mick Mulvaney, the Office of Budget and Management director, made   clear to Republicans on Thursday night that Trump wants a vote   Friday and that he is done negotiating on the bill to overhaul   healthcare. If it is not passed, the president  reports said. ’ ’The   GOP leadership will bring the bill to a vote on the House floor   Friday, . It is unclear whether it has the   votes to pass. ’ ’   "Disastrous Obamacare has led to higher costs & fewer   options. It will only continue to get worse!" Trump tweeted   Thursday evening. "We must #RepealANDReplace. #PassTheBill." ’ ’   House Republican leaders originally wanted to vote on   the AHCA on Thursday, but  led   them to delay the vote. ’ ’’ ’   Trump, who  by House Speaker Paul Ryan, met   with Freedom Caucus members on Wednesday and Thursday but could   not get them to agree to vote for the AHCA. ’ ’   In fact, some concessions that the White House has been   considering for the Freedom Caucus has made moderate members of   the GOP waver on the bill.  to drop provisions from   Obamacare that disallow insurers from denying coverage based on   preexisting conditions. They have also urged the bill to be   scrapped of   essential health benefits that set a   baseline for the necessary coverage a health insurer has to   provide. ’ ’   Mulvaney, once a member of the Freedom Caucus,   reportedly laid down an ultimatum to the GOP members   including the Freedom Caucus and the moderate Tuesday Group at a   meeting on Capitol Hill. ’ ’   As of 8 p. m.
