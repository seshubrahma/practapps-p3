President Donald Trump singled out members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus for refusing to support Paul Ryanâ€™s bill to replace Obamacare. ["The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very   and against Planned Parenthood, allows [Planned Parenthood] to continue if they stop this plan!" Trump wrote on Twitter Friday morning.  The   effort would defund Planned Parenthood, although that part of the bill faces a tough hurdle in the Senate.   Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have signaled their opposition to that part of the bill. Thursday night, senior White House aides delivered a message to House Republicans from the president: pass the bill on Friday, or leave Obamacare in place. On Friday, Trump tried to rally support through Twitter. "After seven horrible years of ObamaCare (skyrocketing premiums  deductibles, bad healthcare) this is finally your chance for a great plan!" Trump wrote.
