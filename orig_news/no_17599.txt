’  ’ "     Donald Trump is replacing the announcer who’s   been behind every presidential inaugural parade since Dwight   Eisenhower’s second term in 1957. " ’   And the announcer is not happy about it. ’ ’   Charlie Brotman, 89,  on Monday about the snub. ’ ’   "I believe the word is probably ’’traumatized,’’" Brotman said. "I   was in shock. And I really felt terrible." ’ "   Brotman  in an earlier interview that he was informed via   email that he wouldn’t be announcing Trump’s inauguration. " ’   "I got the shock of my life," he said. "I felt like Muhammad Ali   had hit me in the stomach." ’ ’   Brotman said he was disappointed because he thought he would be   the announcer. ’ ’   "Then when I read the email I thought I was going to commit   suicide," he said. "It was really terrible. I know that I’’ve been   doing it for 60 years and nobody has ever asked whether I’’m a   Democrat, Republican, independent." ’ "   Steve Ray, a freelance announcer based in Washington, DC, will   announce Trump’s inaugural parade in Brotman’s place. Brotman   told CNN that he believed Trump owed Ray a favor and that’s why   Ray was picked. Ray volunteered for the Trump campaign. " ’   Brotman will still be a part of the inauguration  —   Trump’’s team   has named Brotman "announcer chairman emeritus"  —   and he has been   offered a prime seat at the parade, . ’ ’ ’ "Longtime inauguration announcer says he was "traumatized" when Trump’s team ousted him  "
