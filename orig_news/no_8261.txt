LARGO, FLORIDA  —   Sen. Marco Rubio will still keep his promise to support the Republican nominee, even if that person is Donald Trump. [When asked by reporters this morning if he would still support Trump if he was the nominee, Rubio replied:  I don’t know. I mean, I already talked about the fact that I think Hillary Clinton would be terrible for this country, but the fact that you’re even asking me that question, I still at this moment continue and intend to support the Republican nominee, but, getting harder every day. But he warned of divisions in the Republican party if Trump successfully won the nomination. "I believe Donald Trump as our nominee is going to shatter and fracture the Republican Party and the conservative movement," he said. "I think it’s already having that function. " Rubio spoke at length about the anger that followed Trump at his rallies and the swarms of protesters that shut down his political rally in Chicago. Although he described the protesters as "thugs," he argued that Trump was partially responsible. His style of doing it is basically along the lines of ‘I’m going to say whatever I want, even if it’s not quote, unquote, politically correct.’ Politically correct is one thing. It shouldn’t keep you from saying truth. But, another thing is to be rude and obnoxious and offensive, deliberately offensive for purposes of driving media narrative.
