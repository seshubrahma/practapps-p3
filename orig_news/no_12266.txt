The New York Times has run yet another fake news article  —   this time, an "explainer" about "white nationalism" that features a photograph of Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon under the headline "White Nationalism, Explained. "[Bannon is not a "white nationalist. " In fact, he is not a racist at all, a fact attested to by everyone who has worked with him, including the diverse staff at Breitbart News.  In two separate interviews conducted since Bannon  —   on leave from Breitbart  —   was appointed Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor to   Donald J. Trump, Bannon has made his views explicit.

However, she leads readers to draw that conclusion, and leaves out anything that Bannon, or Breitbart, said to the contrary. Taub’s article is the second "fake news" item on this topic in the past 24 hours.
