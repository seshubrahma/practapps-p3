Behar said, "When he first was elected, I was angry and a lot of people were crying, and I said to them, don’t get sad, get mad. So I was in touch with my rage. Today  —   today I read the "New York Times," I read other things, and I realize that the Democrats are not going to do what they have to do to stop him, that the Democrats are rolling over, unless they’re changing it right now. We have a chance to stop Trump with the Electoral College. They’re about to vote, and according to the Constitution and Alexander Hamilton, these are the reasons they can vote against him. This is the Constitution. Foreign involvement in the election, number one. check. We all know that the Russians hacked into the whole thing.

I don’t think so. Is he giving up his Trump hotel in Istanbul? I don’t think so. He has postponed his  —   what is it, the press conference he was supposed to have. All of a sudden we’re not going to hear about it until after the inauguration?" She added, "The third thing of course is that Hamilton was wanted to prevent voters from the influence of outside actors, bullies, demagogues and populism which got him in.
