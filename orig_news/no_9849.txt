Pat Caddell talked about polling with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow and "just how concerned people are" about a possible rigged election. [Concerning a recent   Consult poll, Breitbart News reported:  The latest poll finds   of voters say the election may be "stolen" from Donald Trump because of widespread voter fraud. A   Consult poll finds that 73 percent of Republicans and 17 percent of Democrats think the election could be taken from Trump. Trump has repeatedly questioned whether or not the election is rigged against him on the campaign trail. "I think it’s more rigged on a ‘cosmic’ level than a precinct level," said Caddell, seemingly pointing a finger more at media than the actual election process. However, he also added, "To pretend there aren’t ballots being stolen, that’s insane. Someone explain to me how Philadelphia votes more people than are adults, according to the census in the city. " While mentioning other specifics regarding ballot problems, Caddell stated, "It is the media working in concert, deserting its role as protector of the people, and becoming now a   jihad to destroy Donald Trump because they believe they are right to do that, including, if necessary, not covering these stunning email revelations constantly coming out of the Clinton campaign. " Caddell also discussed the various conflicting polls coming out, as well as sampling issues and the   number of undecided voters remaining. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
