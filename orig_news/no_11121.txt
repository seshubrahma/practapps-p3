"  During a discussion of   hate crimes, Sanders stated that Trump should put action behinds his words that people shouldn’t engage in hate crimes. She further criticized Trump for the "audacity of privileged white people to sit on television and question if hate crimes are happening, to just flippantly say, stop it, it’s not okay, and not put any action behind those words is appalling to me. " Trump supporter and former Navy SEAL Carl Higbie responded that Trump did say people shouldn’t commit hate crimes and asked where President Obama was during various riots in the country. Higbie added that no one should act violently and say racist things on either side. Sanders responded that "hate crimes and protesting are not the same thing. " Higbie asked, "Then what do you say to the people who are  —   who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?" Sanders then stated, "Oh my goodness, poor white people. Please, oh my  —   stop it, Carl. " She added, "I am calling for people to be peaceful. " Sanders continued, "it’s never okay to use violence, but we can’t keep calling for people to be peaceful  …    when the rhetoric that has been used is not peaceful, when people don’t feel peaceful in their homes.
