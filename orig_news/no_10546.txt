Donald Trump’s latest sex accuser has launched her own online store to sell adult videos, toys, and sexual equipment. She announced the opening of the store one day before going public with her Trump allegations. [Jessica Drake, an adult film actress, appeared with feminist attorney Gloria Allred Saturday at a press conference, alleging that Trump tried to sleep with her after allegedly touching her. Variety reported:  She said that she met Trump ten years ago at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, Calif. She said Trump invited her to his suite after the tournament, and she went with some women friends. When they arrived, she said, he grabbed each of them tightly and kissed them. After they left him, one of his representatives called to invite her to his room alone, but she said she declined. Then Trump himself called and asked, "What do you want? How much?" After she declined his invite, he eventually offered her $10, 000, she said. Drake said that she "may be called a liar or opportunist," but her motives are pure. She offered a photograph of herself, clothed, beside Trump, at the golf event in question as evidence that she met him. But Drake is launching her own online sex store, according to a press release Friday, one day before her press conference with Allred.

Her 2008 AVN Nominations included Best Actress for Raven’s Delilah, Best Supporting Actress for Love Always (for which she also penned the screenplay) and three sex scene noms for her work in The Craving. According to the Trump campaign, "This story is totally false and ridiculous. The picture is one of thousands taken out of respect for people asking to have their picture taken with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her. This is just another attempt by the Clinton campaign to defame a candidate who just today is number one in three different polls. Anyone who would pay thugs to incite violence at a rally against American citizens, as was released on video, will stop at nothing. Just another example of the Clinton campaign trying to rig the election. "
