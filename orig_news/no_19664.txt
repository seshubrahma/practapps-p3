’  ’ ’     Donald Trump tweeted his agreement with Vladimir   Putin on Friday evening, after the  top Democrats were humiliating   themselves by blaming their election loss on alleged Russian   hacking. ’ ’   "Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: ’’In my   opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with   dignity. ’’ So true!" . ’ ’   Putin had criticized Clinton and the Democrats at a press   conference on Friday, claiming that the allegations of Russian   interference during the election was an "affront to their own   dignity." ’ ’   "They are losing on all fronts and looking for scapegoats on whom   to lay the blame," Putin said. "It is important to know how   to lose gracefully." ’ ’   It wasn’’t the first time on Friday that Trump gushed over   remarks made by Putin. Earlier, Trump released a  saying he received a "very nice letter" from the   Russian president, adding that Putin’’s "thoughts are so correct." ’ ’’ ’   The letter, dated Dec. 15, offered Putin’’s "warmest Christmas and   New Year greetings" and stressed the importance of     relations in "ensuring stability and security of the modern   world." ’ ’   Putin continued: "I hope that after you assume the position of   the president of the United States of America we will be able  —     by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner  —   to take real   steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in   different areas as well as bring out level of collaboration on   the international scene to a qualitatively new level." ’
