Welcome to Breitbart News’s daily live updates of the 2016 horse race. [Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich will participate in Fox News’s debate in Detroit Michigan. Fox’s Megyn Kelly will be one of the moderators in her second showdown with Trump. Breitbart News will be providing live updates throughout the evening.   —    —   Kasich says that he is going to win Ohio. He says the media have counted him out since day one. He tells O’Reilly that voters get a sense that he gets them. And that’s why he thinks the race will come to Kasich v. Trump. He says you don’t beat Trump by getting into an insult war with him. Kasich says you beat Trump with   Americans he has the solutions  …    . Kasich says he won’t take VP, thinks the race may go to the convention, where an "adult" will be chosen.  —   Cruz insists that Trump will get clobbered in a general election. He says there is so much negative on him that he may be the only Republican on earth who may lose to Clinton. Cruz says he thinks Trump can say two opposite things in the same minute and believe what he is saying when asked if he thinks Trump is an honest man. He says Trump could say it is hot and cold in a minute and still pass a lie detector test. Cruz does not answer when O’Reilly asks if he thinks Trump is dishonest. "I’m not going to speak to his heart," Cruz says. But he sys his rhetoric does not match his record. Cruz says his is a "  campaign" because you know what you’re getting with me.  —   Trump posts his "A" grade for Trump University from the Better Business Bureau. He has come under fire from his opponents for having run a scam university.  —   Rubio says Trump has been very good at dominating the media coverage and now that the race has narrowed, people will realize that he lacks substance on the issues. He says this is the most important election in a generation and you can’t elect someone who says "I’ll get there and figure it out. " O’Reilly says Rubio would have won Virginia had Kasich had not been there. Rubio says Trump has been scamming people over the years and now he is trying to con people into giving his vote. Rubio says "tonight, we changed his position" on various issues and Trump will have to be held to account. Rubio vows that he will win Florida and he doesn’t believe the polls that have Trump leading. Rubio says he doesn’t regret trading insults with Trump because if anyone deserves it, it’s Trump.  —   In a   interview, Trump says the debate was tough but fair. He says Cruz is his primary competition. When O’Reilly asked about Romney, Trump says Romney is a "failed candidate" who "made a fool out of himself. " He says Romney is a "jealous guy" who would have liked to run but was "afraid. " Trump says his retort was better. He thinks Romney may be angling to get the nomination at a contested convention because he didn’t endorse anybody. Trump says Romney is a "phony. " He says the worst guy we can have is Romney at the top of the ticket. Trump says he will defeat Hillary because he has a chance of winning New York and will win in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and add states that other Republicans have not been able to be turn red. Trump says O’Reilly may have to ask his "psychiatrist" about why he has gone negative on Trump. Trump says he heard he won the debate based on online polls. Trump says the best chance to win is to win as a Republican. O’Reilly says Trump’s wife Melania creamed Trump in the ratings on Greta. 11: 10: Breitbart’s Pollak: Rubio Wins Cheers for Answer on Flint at GOP Debate. Kasich says he will take the formulas he has used successfully in Ohio to fix the problems in Washington and restore the spirit of America as he send power back to the people, Rubio says this has been an "unusual election cycle. " He says if we get this election right, the 21st century can be the greatest era. Cruz says he wants to talk to every soldier, sailor, airmen and marine. He says for seven years, you’ve had a    who doesn’t believe in you and send you into battle with rules of engagement. He also wants to talk to first responders who have  been left behind by Obama. Cruz says when he gets into the White House, "I will have your back. " Trump says "I am going to bring jobs back to the United States like no one else can. " He will fix the military, take care of our vets, strenghtn our border" and Americans will be proud of their country. 10:55: Baier asks the candidates if they will definitely say they will support the Republican nominee even if it is Donald J. Trump. Rubio and Cruz answer "yes. " So does Kasich. Wallace asks Trump if he can definitely say he can support the nominee even if it is not him. Trump says he is very proud that millions of people have come to the Republican Party and "it’s the biggest thing happening in politics. " He says "yes, I will. " 10:52: Kasich laughs when Wallace says his campaign ran an ad suggesting Trump would name Putin as his running made. Wallace asks if he thinks Trump is naive about Putin. Kasich says "I’m  not biting. " Kasich says that in Russia, we need to tell them that we will arm the Ukrainians. Kasich will tell the Chinese that they don’t own the South China Sea and to stop hacking us. In the Middle East, he says the Egyptians know they are on their last legs while the   know they are at risk too.  In Turkey, Kasich says we have to bring them toward the West and not the East  …     10:50: Wallace tells Cruz what do about the North Koreans putting their nuclear weapons on ready  …     Cruz says this is a failure of the Clinton administration that negotiated a deal with the North Koreans and lifting sanctions. Cruz says our options are constrained because a lunatic has nuclear weapons. He talks up missile defense, including   missile defense, while moving carriers into the South China Sea. He says we should put pressure on China because North Korea is a client state of China. 10:45: Debate turns to foreign policy. Wallace points out that Rubio compared Trump to Kim Jong Un as a "lunatic" trying to get nuclear weapons. Rubio says Trump has not shown "seriousness" when it came to foreign policy. Rubio says "foreign policy is not only consequential" but much of our future depends on it. Rubio says today’s millennials have the chance to be the greatest generation in 100 years. He says strong American leadership is needed to make sure the world is not dangerous, unstable. Rubio says Trump lacks the "intellectual curiosity" to learn about these complex issues. Trump says Rubio is "not a leader. Believe me. " Trump says "they will do as I tell them. It’s very simple. " He says "we are in a very dangerous place" with a "depleted military. " He then says we are going to take care of our vets and build up the military by getting equipment that the general and the soldiers want. Rubio again accuses Trump of engaging in insults because he lacks substance. Trump says "wrong" after Rubio accuses Trump of praising Putin. Rubio asks Trump whether he will give detailed answers on foreign policy instead of engaging in insults. 10:37: Rubio says  there should be no restrictions on the Second Amendment. He says it is second for a reason. He says they understood you cannot have life, liberty, happiness without the Second Amendment. He says criminals do not follow laws. And that is why gun laws are not effective. Baier says Trump was once for an assault weapons ban. But Trump says he now wants no restrictions on the Second Amendment and is a "very big supporter of the Second Amendment. " He says he does not support the assault weapons ban anymore. Trump says "unlike Donald, I would not support banning firearms. " Cruz says Clinton’s ban did nothing to reduce crime and only took away the rights of   citizens. Cruz says Trump can’t say he supports the Second Amendment and then want to compromise on Supreme Court Justices. Cruz says Trump has written checks to   and any Justice they sign off on will be a   judge. Cruz says we are one judge away from reversing Heller. Trump says Cruz was the primary supporter of John Roberts. Cruz responds that "Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth. " Cruz asks Trump to breathe so he does not interrupt. Rubio quips that Donald is "very flexible" after Cruz says he doesn’t want to see anyone doing Yoga on the stage. 10:35: When asked whether he thinks gay people should adopt kids, Cruz says adoption is decided at the state level and he would leave the question of   to the states. He said that is how it was for two centuries until five unelected judges wrongfully decided to tear down the marriage laws of all 50 states. Cruz slams Trump and says he will never compromise on religious liberty when nominating a Supreme Court Justice. He says "I will never compromise away" religious liberties  …     Cruz points out that he has spent two decades fighting for religious liberty and says he represented veterans defending the Mojave Desert Memorial. Trump has nothing to say when asked to respond to Cruz about whether he would be flexible in appointing Justices who will not compromise on religious liberty. 10:30: When asked if gay marriage dissenters have rights, Kasich says he tries to be a man of faith every day. He says it is "another issue" if people are forced to participate in something they don’t like. He said he hoped things would "settle down" after the Supreme Court’s gay marriage ruling. He says people should not sue photographer if they do not want to photograph a gay marriage. People should have "common sense" and just find another photographer. Kasich says someone should not be pressured to participate in something against their religious beliefs and we may have to deal with that with a law. But he again says people should just have "common sense" on these matters. 10:28: Cruz is asked what he would do to bring manufacturing jobs to places like Detroit. Cruz says Detroit has been "decimated" by 60 years of failed   policies. He accuses   Democrats of being weak on crime and pushing failed economic policies. He says the media should be telling the story of destructive   policies but they don’t. Wallace asks Cruz to answer the question (he didn’t do that to Rubio). Cruz says he will repeal Obamacare and pull back regulations that are killing small businesses  and manufacturers. His tax plan, he says, (16%   flat tax) will bring back millions manufacturing jobs. 10:25: Kasich is asked about Detroit’s urban blight. Kelly asks if the federal government should bail out Detroit’s schools if it bailed out the auto industry. Kasich says he would bundle federal programs into four buckets and send them to the states. He talks about vocational training and more school choice. He says adults need to fight in our communities for our children’s education and out children first. He says the people in Detroit are going to rise and they need to be involved. 10:23: Candidates are asked about the Flint water  . Rubio says he and other candidates have talked about it. He says it was a "systemic breakdown" at every level of government. He says it is unfair to politicize the issue because someone didn’t wake up one morning and decide to poison the water. He says it is absurd that Democrats are trying to politicize the issue and there is a proper role that the federal government can play to help cities like Flint and to ensure that something like that never happens again. 10:17: Kasich talks about the people who show up at his town halls. They have lost their children. Their wages have gone down. They see the rich get richer while their sons and daughters are living in the basement. Kasich says people are hungry for politicians who can fix the economy. But they also want to believe that they have the power to fix things where they live. Kasich says voters are yearning for someone who can bring America together and "reignite the spirit of America  …     so let’s stop fighting. " 10:14: Cruz asks voters at home if this is the debate they want playing out in the general election. He says if we nominate Donald, we will spend the spring and fall with the GOP nominee facing a fraud trial while Hillary Clinton asking why Trump donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to her and her foundation. Cruz tells Trump to "count to ten" when he continues to interrupt. Cruz says he has "beat Trump" five times and asks people who believe in the Constitution to stand with him and join his campaign. Cruz says that the CNN poll that Trump is touting found that Trump is losing to Clinton by eight points. That poll shows Cruz beating Clinton. "We can’t mess this up," Cruz says. He accuses Trump of being on every side of every issue. He says the stakes are too high to nominate someone like Trump. 10:12: Rubio says he is trying to do to the American voter what he did to the Trump University students who were conned. Trump says the "real con artist" is Sen. Marco Rubio, who was elected in Florida and has the worst voting record in the United States Senate. Trump says the people of Florida can’t stand Rubio. He accuses Rubio of scamming and defrauding the people of Florida. Rubio says Trump has "cheated people out of their money" time and time again. 10:09: Kelly points out that Trump countersued the lead plaintiff and the court threw out the countersuit. She points out that the court found that victims of con artists sing the praises of their fleecers until they realize that they have been fleeced. Rubio says he spoke to one of the Trump University victims and he says Trump refused to give people their money back when they realized it was a scam and demand a refund. Trump claims he gave refunds to some people. [If Fox is fair, they would ask Rubio about his support for   colleges that also screwed people over  …    we’ll see if they do so.] 10:06: Rubio says there is a difference between flexibility and telling people whatever they want to hear  …     Rubio brings up Trump University and says people went into debt and have nothing in return for it after Trump said whatever he needed to get them to give him their   money. Trump says he doesn’t settle cases and that is why he doesn’t get sued often. Rubio accuses Trump of lying about Trump University’s ratings and whether people were satisfied. Kelly says the last public rating from the Better Business Bureau was a  . Trump insists that it was elevated to an A. 10:05: Kasich says people want to know whether they can believe it if someone tells them something. Kasich says people are upset because politicians tell them what they hear and they don’t deliver on these promises. [This is presenting Cruz a strong opportunity to say he kept his word to his constituents and that is why Washington hates him.] 10:00: At the top of the hour, Kelly says Trump has told voters one thing only to reverse himself right after. She has three examples ready. She has three videos ready on Trump’s   on Afghanistan, Syrian refugees, and whether Bush lied to get us into the Iraq War. Kelly says "there are many other examples" and how can he claim to be someone who "tells it like it is. " Trump points out that one of the interviews was with Howard Stern —   Trump says he and Stern are great friends. And he points out Kelly’s friendship with Stern [Kelly said some racy things in an interview with Stern]. On Syrian refugees, Trump says we should be building safe zones in Syria. He said he he has changed his tune on things, especially Syrian refugees, the more he studies an issue. Kelly asks Trump voters are wondering what his core is  …     Trump says he hasn’t seen a successful person who didn’t have a certain degree of flexibility. He claims he has a "strong core. " 9:55: Baier asks Trump about two or three potential national security advisers. Trump names Richard Haas, Col. Jack Jacobs. Kasich points out that a majority of voters in a survey said they trusted Kasich the most on foreign policy. He points out that he was there with Reagan when he was rebuilding the military. 9:49: Baier asks Trump about national security    neocons coming out against his candidacy. He asks Trump what he would do if the U. S. military refused to carry out his waterboarding orders. Trump says they won’t refuse. He says they are chopping off heads in the Middle East and "we’re talking about waterboarding. " He says Cruz had a hard time with the waterboarding question and he thinks "if we want to go stronger," we should. He says if someone flies into the World Trade Center and their family leaves to Saudi Arabia, he would have no problem targeting that family. Cruz says Americans understand that "yelling and cursing at people" doesn’t make someone a tough guy. Cruz says he will build the military like Reagan and destroy radical Islam like Reagan defeated the Soviets. Cruz says every militant will understand that they are signing their death warrant if they join ISIS. Re: Snowden, Cruz points out that he said in his initial statement that if Snowden violated the law, then he should be prosecuted. Cruz says now it is clear that Snowden committed treason and undermined the ability to defend the United States. 9:45: From Breitbart’s Joel Pollak: Trump Reassures Nation About Penis Size at GOP Debate, 9:43: Cruz says he will propose a   moratorium on the   visa program. Trump says people don’t want a   job so "we will bring people in and send people out. " Trump says when we can, we hire people from Palm Beach. Trump says Americans don’t want very short,   jobs. Rubio says "that’s not accurate. " He says there have been 300 Americans who applied and they were not  hired. Rubio says you have people captive when you bring in workers from abroad. Rubio is making a strong case —  but it rings hollow when his bill wanted to triple the number of   visas. Trump says he takes advantage of the law and there’s nothing wrong with it. Cruz then calls on Trump to have the New York Times release the tapes. 9:41: Trump shifts his position on   visas. [Has he even read his own plan?] He says he will change it because we need more brainpower in this country. He says he is softening his position on   visas. He says he is not playing to people’s fantasies on immigration and he is playing to the fact that our country is in trouble. 9:35: Kelly asks Rubio about Gang of Eight. Rubio says Trump should call on the New York Times to release the audio. Rubio says he wants to solve the issue and he did the best he could in the Senate controlled by Harry Reid. "We do need to deal with the issue," he says. Rubio says illegal immigration will be brought under control. And he will move forward on immigration only after illegal immigration is under control. Kelly doesn’t ask Rubio a   about whether he supports a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants and   tuition. [Like Wallace, Kelly asks Rubio a "tough" question, let’s him dodge, and does not follow up. That seems to be what Fox has planned  for Rubio.] 9:30: "Nice to be with you, Megyn," Trump says. "You’re looking well. " Kelly asks Trump about a BuzzFeed reported that claimed Trump expressed "flexibility" on immigration to the New York Times in an    interview. She wonders if Trump told the New York Times if he was flexible on deportation. Trump says BuzzFeed said he wouldn’t run for president and "boy, were they wrong. " Trump says in terms of immigration, there always has to be some "tug and pull and deal. " "I would never release    conversations," Trump says. He adds that is not fair to anyone. And he says he is "not that flexible" on immigration. Trump says re: flexibility, he essentially says he will negotiate on the height of the wall but not on the wall itself. 9:29: Kelly essentially wonders if voters want Sessions’s policies on immigration, shouldn’t they support Trump since Sessions endorsed him. Cruz says that Trump supported Carter over Reagan and Kerry over George W. Bush. Trump says Trump funded Harry   and he funded five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight. Cruz says Trump has written checks to Clinton 10 times and wonders how he can stand up on a debate stage and say he wasn’t for Clinton  …     Trump says he supported Reagan and wrote checks to Clinton for his businesses. Trump says "the last person Hillary Clinton wants to face is Donald Trump. That I can tell you. " 9:28: Kasich says balancing the budget is not a theory. And he is the only person who can say he was the architect behind balancing the budget. Very strong answer from Kasich, who inspired a lot of people to become Republicans in the 1990s with his floor speeches that were seen on CSPAN. Kasich says he is the one person running for president in either party who has restored the budget and cut taxes. 9:24: Wallace asks Cruz who will collect the taxes if he abolishes the IRS. Cruz says every American will fill out their taxes on a postcard and when we get rid of the corporate welfare, subsidies, and carveouts, it will simply the IRS. He says there will be an office in the Treasury Department to receive the postcards. Cruz says that in between the insults between Rubio and Trump, the specificity was lacking. He says he has rolled out a plan to cut $500 billion in federal spending. Cruz says he understands Trump’s voters are angry at Washington and Cruz says for forty years, Trump has been a part of the corruption in Washington that they are angry about. He accuses Trump of using government for private gain. [This argument doesn’t work well and is too academic. But it doesn’t work when Trump’s voters think he will screw over the politicians just like he looked out for himself.   consultants do not understand this dynamic.] 9:21: Trump says he will get rid of the Department of Education, the EPA and get rid of waste, fraud and abuse that is "massive" throughout the federal government. Wallace claims Trump’s numbers do not add up  —   and Fox has graphics prepared to try to trip Trump up on his math. Trump says "we are going to buy things for less money" re: Medicare and "other things. " Trump says we will properly negotiate to save the government money. 9:16: Wallace asks Rubio how many jobs he has created. Rubio claims Trump has inherited $100 million. Rubio says Trump can announce that the Donald J. Trump clothing will be made in the United States. Rubio says those in public service must allow the private sector to create jobs. But he hasn’t answered how many jobs he has created. Wallace asks Trump about his clothing collection but DOES NOT press Rubio about how many jobs he has created. "This little guy has lied so much about my record," Trump says of Rubio. Trump uses the opportunity to blast TPP. Rubio says everything in his campaign store is made in America. Rubio says Trump engages in personal attacks because "he doesn’t have the answers. " Trump says Rubio hasn’t employed one person while he has employed tens of thousands of people. When Trump calls Rubio "little Marco," Rubio calls him "Big Donald. " [What a comeback!] 9:12: Kasich says he can beat Clinton because he can get "crossover votes" and voters seem him as the "adult on the stage. " He says he is working for President because he worked hard to fix this country as Chair of the Budget Committee in Congress. Baier presses Kasich on his path to the nomination, and Kasich all but concedes everyone’s path to the nomination is through a contested convention. Kasich says "it’s March Madness" and we’re heading up north "to my turf. " Kasich says voters are wondering why he isn’t getting that much time on the debate stage. He has brought wage growth ad economic security to the country and he wants to do it again as president. He says the strength of our country is in our  . 9:08: Cruz says Americans are struggling and not interested in candidates bickering like school children. He says he will repeal every word of Obamacare and will pull back the regulators that are killing small businesses and will abolish the IRS. [The only person who says something different at every debate is Trump. He keeps everyone interested and they tune in to hear his policy prescriptions on immigration, trade.] Trump says he has won 10 states while Cruz has only won two or three contests in response to Cruz’s claim that he is the only candidate who can beat Trump. "But he’s getting beaten very very badly," Trump says. "So where is this coming from?" Rubio says that   of the people have voted against Trump. But way more voters have voted against Rubio. Rubio says Republicans don’t want to turn over Reagan’s GOP to someone who is not conservative. [Rubio doesn’t know how to deliver devastating attacks. As Newsweek’s Matt Cooper noted, he does seem like a hormonal teenager just firing off randomly.] Trump says a national poll found Rubio at 15 while Trump is at 49. Trump points out that means nearly 80% of Republicans are against Rubio. Trump says he is beating Clinton in many polls when Rubio claims that Trump cannot beat Clinton in a general election. 9:06: Baier asks Rubio about his personal attacks against Trump after vowing not to do so. Rubio says Trump has mocked everybody with personal attacks. And Trump deserved to be attacked that way. Rubio, who seems a bit anxious, says he would much rather have a debate on policy. He says the media have given Trump’s personal attacks "an incredible amount of coverage. " Trump responds by saying that he called Rubio a "lightweight. " Trump says Rubio is not that much of a lightweight. Trump says "he hit my hands. " Trump says "I guarantee you there’s no problem" after remarking that Rubio implied that something else was small if Trump’s hands were small. 9:04: Trump "totally disavows" David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan. He says he has been doing so for two weeks. He says just take a look at his Twitter account. 9:02: As Wallace (not Kelly) asks Trump about Romney, the crowd boos (Romney). Trump says Romney was a "failed candidate" who "failed miserable" and was an "embarrassment to everybody. " Trump says he "wants to be relevant" and "back in the game. " Trump says he believes in free trade but if you look at China, Japan, Mexico and "every other country we do business with," we "are getting absolutely crushed on trade. " Trump says he has great people lined up re: trade and "we will make great trade deals. " 9:00: Chris Wallace introduces the candidates. 8:45: Trump announced that Sen. Jeff Sessions will chair his National Security Advisory Committee. Trump said in a statement: "It is an honor to have Jeff as a member of the team. I have such great respect for him and I look forward to working with him on the issues most important to Americans. " Sessions, whom Matt Drudge described as the conservative "soul" of the Senate, endorsed Trump last Sunday in Alabama. 7:04: Chris Matthews calls Romney a "certified loser" who is only attacking Trump because of his own ambition. 7:00: More calls for "unity.
