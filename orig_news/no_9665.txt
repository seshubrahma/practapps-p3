The CNN report points out that a "significant" number of Hispanics who have been in the United States for a long time are worried that Latino newcomers may take their jobs. How about that? Who knew? The fact that CNN didn’t file a report saying they couldn’t find a Latino in Nevada supporting Trump means the mainstream media know that Trump may do better with Hispanics than what they have been publicly predicting. 7:10: Rubio senior adviser Jason Roe says Rick Tyler was merely"collateral damage.

But not only is Trump bringing in new voters into the political process like Obama did in 2008, one can make the argument that Trump is accomplishing what the GOP establishment tried to argue that Rubio would do best —  win over Tea Party conservatives and moderate Republicans: This argument, which has been floating out there today, strikes me as lazy and thin. https:  .   —   Brett LoGiurato (@BrettLoGiurato) February 22, 2016,  To deny that Trump, who turned SC into a      victory, was not dominant there seems like a state of denial.  —   Brett LoGiurato (@BrettLoGiurato) February 22, 2016,  2.

Why? Not only is Trump speaking truth to power on two crucial issues  —   trade and immigration  —   but it is now clear he has ignited long smoldering voter anger on both issues. None of his Republican opponents comes close to sounding serious on these issues. And even in a general election, he holds pole position. The likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, whose chances have improved after the Nevada result, has belatedly toughened her stance on both issues, but her conversion seems driven less by conviction than political expediency. 1:17: CNN: Nevada Looks Like ‘Trump Country’ CNN’s Maeve Reston says almost every Republican voter "we’ve met is saying they are for Trump.

The agency was accountable to no one, he fumed, "except   lunatics who us it to prop up fascist dictatorships. " At the time, the    socialist was running for U. S.
