Sunday on CNN’s "State of the Union," presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s convention manager Paul Manafort said that it is "middle America" that does not care about Trump’s tax returns.  Manafort said, "He said he will release taxes. He said once the audit is completed he will release the taxes. " He added, "This is an issue that the media is interested in, it is not not an issue middle America is  interested in frankly. Donald Trump will comply when the audit is done. You talk to tax attorneys who are not politically motivated, they’d never advise their clients to release any tax information in the course of an audit. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
