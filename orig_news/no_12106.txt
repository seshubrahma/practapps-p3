WATERBURY, Conn. April 24 (UPI)  —   A    man was arrested Saturday after the U. S. Secret Service saw a tweet alleging a bomb threat on a Donald Trump rally in Waterbury, Conn. [The Secret Service contacted the Connecticut State Police about 12:45 p. m. Saturday. According to the state police, the tweet said "is somebody going to bomb the Trump rally or am I going to have to? ," ABC News reported.  Sean Taylor Morkys allegedly made a second post warning his friend to have his family members leave the rally or risk injury, police said. Donald Trump, the Republican   in the 2016 presidential campaign spoke in two Connecticut cities Saturday in his quest to capture more than 50 percent of the vote in the state’s Republican primary coming up Tuesday. Law enforcement tracked the tweets to a Waterbury home, where they found Morkys. After determining he didn’t pose any immediate threat, Morkys was taken into custody, then released on $25, 000 bond, Fox News reported. State Police detectives and the Waterbury Police Department, along with special agents from the Secret Service, interviewed Morkys at his home, State Trooper First Class Kelly Grant said. He was charged with   threatening, inciting injury to person or property and   breach of peace. He has a court hearing May 4. Trump stormed in to Connecticut Saturday seeking that state’s 28 Republican delegates, the Hartford Courant reported. Trump told the crowds in both cities he won nearly 62 percent of the vote in New York and planned to sweep Connecticut. Gaining 50 percent in a primary was difficult when he had 16 opponents, Trump said, but his chances of doing that are better now that he has only two opponents, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
