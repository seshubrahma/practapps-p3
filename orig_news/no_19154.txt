’  ’ "   The former Miss Universe whom Hillary Clinton referenced during   Monday’s presidential debate did not deny accusations that she’d   been an accomplice to a 1998 murder in Venezuela. " ’   Alicia Machado, a vocal critic of Donald Trump for derogatory   comments she claims he made about her weight years ago, was   confronted with the accusations on CNN on Wednesday. ’ ’   "There are reports that Trump surrogates tonight have been   referencing and pointing to on CNN and elsewhere about an   incident in 1998 in Venezuela, where you were accused of driving   a getaway car from a murder scene. You were never charged with   this," said CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. ’ ’   Cooper continued: "The judge in the case also said you threatened   to kill him after he indicted your boyfriend for the attempted   murder. I just want to give you a chance to address these reports   that the Trump surrogates are talking about." ’ "   Machado didn’t deny the accusations. " ’   "You know, I have my past," she said. "Of course, everybody has a   past. I’’m not a saint girl. But that is not the point now." ’ ’   The former Miss Universe continued: "He can use whatever he wants   to use. The point is, that happened 20 years ago." ’ "   Trump’s public feud with Machado came up at the first   presidential debate Monday night. " ’   "One of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty   contest," Clinton said on Monday. "He loves beauty contests,   supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman   ’’Miss Piggy. ’’ Then he called her ’’Miss Housekeeping’’ because she   was Latina. Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado." ’ ’ ’
