Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway has revealed she turned down the role of White House press secretary for the Trump administration, instead choosing to focus on her young family. [Talking to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Conway said she "politely declined" the role, given the importance of the role in an administration where the press will be particularly hostile.  "As you imagine in President Trump’s administration, communications will be a very important aspect for it and there will be a number of people handling that," she said. Conway, who still currently serves as an adviser to Trump, told a POLITICO panel last week that she was not seeking a high level role in the administration and instead plans to spend more time with her family. "I think the lesson also is all the opportunities out there for women, increasingly in politics and media and public policy and government affairs —  all the things we do here in Washington —  that we still have to make choices, there are limits," she said. Trump is yet to announce the role of press secretary. Some of the rumoured contenders for the role include the Trump transition team communications director Jason Miller, the Republican National Committee’s communications director Sean Spicer, and conservative commentator Laura Ingraham, who has also served Trump as an informal adviser.
