Border Patrol Agent Brandon Judd, speaking in his capacity as president of the National Border Patrol Council, pushed back against House Speaker Paul Ryan’s contention that funding for the border wall can be delayed. [Judd’s comments came during an interview with Fox Business Channel’s Stuart Varney where he addressed the dramatic impact the Trump Administration has already had on reducing illegal border crossings. "Speaker Paul Ryan is suggesting that Congress delay border wall funding until next year," Varney stated. "What do you say about that?"  "I disagree," Judd said flatly. "President Trump promised that he was going to secure the border, and part of securing the border is putting in place, the proper technology and resources that allows us to be successful and a border wall in strategic locations is one of those things that we must get done. " Ryan’s comments that he may delay funding the border wall came during a March interview with Norah O’Donnell on "CBS This Morning". "The big chunk of money for the border wall really is next year’s fiscal appropriations," Ryan said. "Because they literally can’t start construction even this quickly. " The Trump Administration is moving forward with the bidding process, Breitbart Texas reported. Officials are expected to choose 4 to 10 companies to build a prototype section of wall to demonstrate their bid’s viability and effectiveness. Officials with knowledge of the plan spoke to the Daily Mail on condition of anonymity and said contractors would build the prototypes on a   strip of   land near San Diego. Trump began seeking bids to build prototypes of the wall in February, Breitbart Texas reported. More than 300 companies quickly signed up to present proposals on how to take the President’s vision and promise to reality.
