’  ’ ’   Last year, the Russian government approved the renewals of   six trademarks for President Donald Trump that were about to   expire,  on Sunday. ’ ’   Four of those renewals were officially registered by Russia on   Election Day.  ’ "   The Times found that the Kremlin approved applications for the   trademarks’ renewal beginning in April 2016 and ending in   December of that year, according to records maintained by   Rospatent, Russia’s government agency which oversees   intellectual property. " ’   The trademarks were originally obtained between 1996 and 2007,   but they had gone unused. Each of the trademarks was granted a     extension in 2016, the investigation found.  ’ ’   Trump has repeatedly said that he has no remaining business   deals in or involving Russia.  ’ ’   " ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ "   The Times noted that nothing in the records maintained by   Rospatent indicates Trump was shown particular favor   when trademarks bearing his name were approved for renewal.

In an apparent response to the report, Trump    on Friday,   " ’ ’  ’ ’   "Then why did he say he was [under investigation]?" Todd asked.   "I mean, was this just  ?
