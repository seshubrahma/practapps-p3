"I just pray that the first n***a who tries to assassinate Donald Trump don’t miss," another added. One joked: "My mom is talking about assassinate donald trump. watch out guy my white suburban mother is coming for you. " While some also called for the death of vice   Mike Pence. "If trump wins pls dont assassinate him without getting mike pence first because his a** is f***ing crazy," one user tweeted  …     A source close to the Secret Service, told the DailyMail. com that the agency were well aware of the threats and that they had seen a spike since Trump was elected on Tuesday. They said there were ‘mechanisms in place’ to monitor social media for such posts, and to determine which threats were more concerning than others but said that "every threat was taken seriously. " Twitter routinely removed   trending topics and manipulated hashtags that hurt failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the election. Furious users accused the site of censoring the explosive DNC Wikileaks story in July after #DNCLeaks, with over a quarter million tweets, vanished from the Trending section, replaced by the far less popular #DNCLeak.
