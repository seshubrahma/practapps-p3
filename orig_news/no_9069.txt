Monday on "CNN Newsroom," while discussing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s economic predictions, former speechwriter Nixon and Ford speechwriter, actor and author Ben Stein said Trump’s ideas were "nonsensical" and "breathtakingly horrible. "  Stein said, "In all of my years as an economist, which is roughly 50 years, I’ve never seen such nonsense as we just heard from Mr. Trump. And it breaks my heart, it makes me want to cry because I’m Republican, I’ve never voted for a Democrat, and to think the guy who’s our likely standard bearer has such nonsensical ideas on every single aspect of the economy is just breathtakingly horrible. " He added, "You know, I don’t know what goes on in his head. He’s a force of nature. I don’t know what goes on in his head. But it’s frightening that he has no economist advisers. Carl Icahn a very smart guy on Wall Street who’s made a great deal of money. Steve Wynn who runs best hotels in Las Vegas. But as far as economic advisers, as far as I can tell, he doesn’t have any and he desperately needs some. The things he’s saying are wacky as wacky can be. Just off the charts.
