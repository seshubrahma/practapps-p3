At a rally in Maryland Wednesday, GOP presidential   Donald Trump brought up his friend and New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady.  He praised Brady, which did not go well in Baltimore Ravens territory. "Massachusetts, home of Tom Brady. Do we love Tom Brady?" Trump said. "We love Tom Brady, right? He’s great. He’s great. He’s great. How can you not?" The crowd responded with a round of boos. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
