(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Obama, back from his family’s vacation on Martha’s Vineyard, prepared for the final few months of his tenure. He’ll head out on Tuesday to Louisiana, where heavy flooding killed 13 people, displaced tens of thousands more, and damaged tens of thousands of buildings, including homes, businesses and schools. _____ 2. The curtain came down on the Olympic Games, but the reckoning is still underway. The host city of Rio de Janeiro is counting gains, like a revitalized port and new subway line. The U. S. team, sparkling with talent and missing many Russian challengers, won a staggering array of gold (46) silver (37) and bronze (38) medals. One big loser: Ryan Lochte. Four companies, including Speedo USA and Ralph Lauren, severed ties over the gold medalist’s discredited account of a gunpoint robbery. _____ 3. Terrorist attacks often share a surprising element: ordinary people who risk their lives to intervene. On July 14, three men independently chased down the huge truck rampaging through holiday crowds in Nice, France. One climbed on the running board and began hitting the driver, who tried to shoot him. "He was concentrating on me in that moment he could not kill people," said the man, above center, receiving a medal. _____ 4. Questions surrounding Hillary Clinton’s email practices flared again as a Federal District Court judge ordered the State Department to provide a timetable for releasing nearly 15, 000 new messages uncovered by the F. B. I. And her campaign, facing a reshaped Trump organization dominated by   media figures, has begun speaking of "conspiracy theories," evoking the "vast   conspiracy" she blamed when Bill Clinton’s presidency was engulfed by accusations of sexual misconduct. _____ 5. Mr. Trump, working with a new campaign manager and a newly formed Hispanic advisory council, appeared to be reconsidering his pledge to conduct mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. "We want to come up with a really fair, but firm, answer," he told Fox News. _____ 6. Social conservatives celebrated after a federal judge in Texas blocked federal guidelines on transgender access to bathrooms, limiting the possibility of legal action against school districts. The state’s attorney general praised the defeat of "the Obama administration’s latest illegal federal overreach. " _____ 7. Just how harsh the Philippines’ drug war has become under President Rodrigo Duterte became clear. The nation’s top police official said killings by the police and vigilantes have reached nearly 1, 800 in less than seven weeks. And some 600, 000 people have turned themselves in as drug dealers or users to save their lives. _____ 8. New York City’s subway system, one of the world’s largest, will be getting new, more spacious trains in the next few years. Already in use in London, Shanghai and Toronto, above, the   cars are connected by accordionlike passageways that allow 10 percent higher capacity. _____ 9. Set the DVR. Our reviewer recommends the third season of "Halt and Catch Fire" (Tuesdays, 10 p. m. Eastern, AMC). The show traces the   revolution of the ’80s in tech, personal and cultural terms. This season throws two women who started an online gaming company into Silicon Valley, and "the unfamiliar and   world of venture capitalists. " _____ 10. Finally, good news: The English village of Ashton Hayes set out to lower its carbon footprint. And it succeeded. Over 10 years, measures like using clotheslines, installing solar panels and insulating homes has led to a   cut in emissions, inspiring towns, cities and counties around the world to follow suit. "We just think everyone should try to clean up their patch," a resident of the village said. "And rather than going out and shouting about it, we just do it.
