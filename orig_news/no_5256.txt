  Miss USA Kara McCullough faced widespread backlash from liberal social media users after she called health care a "privilege" and not a right while answering questions onstage during Sunday night’s pageant. [McCullough, a scientist who works for the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and who competed as Miss District of Columbia, was asked if she believes health care should be a right or a privilege for American citizens.  "I’m definitely going to say it’s a privilege," the    pageant winner said, adding that taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to subsidize someone else’s health care. "As a government employee, I’m granted healthcare. And I see firsthand that for one, to have healthcare, you need to have jobs, so therefore we need to continue to cultivate this environment so that we’re given the opportunities to have healthcare as well as jobs for all Americans worldwide," McCullough said. "I’m definitely going to say it’s a privilege."
