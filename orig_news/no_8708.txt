Hillary Clinton painted her Republican rival Donald Trump as a "dangerously incoherent" and unstable man, claiming that "It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin. "[Clinton spoke Thursday in San Diego ahead of her divisive primary battle with Bernie Sanders, trying to position herself as the Democratic   by focusing on Trump in her remarks.  "They’re not even really ideas. Just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies," Clinton said of Trump’s platform. Clinton also spoke of Trump’s supposed "bizarre fascination" with "dictators and strongmen. " Clinton and the Democrats are pushing an attack line similar to Democratic attacks on 1964 Republican candidate Barry Goldwater, who was painted as an unstable potential warmonger by Lyndon Johnson. Trump did not think much of Clinton’s   remarks: Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin’ Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.  —   Donald J.
