[In an official campaign statement, Donald Trump said that Hillary Clinton was involved in "corruption is on a scale we have never seen before," praising the FBI for "having the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.

The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s investigation, and they are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America.
