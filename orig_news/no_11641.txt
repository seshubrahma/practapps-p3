Two conservative students at the University of Michigan ruffled some feathers when they traveled to a Bernie Sanders rally in an effort to raise money for Donald Trump.[  Hunter Swogger and Aliceea Rice received some interesting reactions when they asked a crowd of Bernie Sanders supporters to contribute to Donald Trump’s plan to build a border wall to prevent illegal immigration. While most Bernie supporters were able to laugh off Swogger’s antics, others responded with anger and frustration. Swogger, who is the Executive Editor of the Michigan Review, remained upbeat and humorous throughout the video, despite some Sanders’ supporters spitting in his donation bucket and attempting to use it as a trash can. Swogger and Rice were forced to defend themselves against allegations of racism and were also asked to prove that their "Make America Great Again" hats were not made in China. After revealing this his hat was made in the United States, Swogger referred to Trump as "a man of his word" and "a man of integrity. "  Students at the University of Michigan recently established a Students for Trump chapter, which, according to Swogger, provides a vehicle for an "underrepresented minority"  group to "make [their] voices heard. " The University, which has a boulder on campus that is often used by students groups as a billboard for promotion, was recently taken over by Students for Trump. In the morning hours of March 7th, they   the boulder red, and wrote the phrases, "Make America Great Again" and "Build the Wall".  Although their message has since been covered over with buckets of  blue and green paint, the efforts of Swogger and Rice haven’t gone unnoticed. Their video of the Sanders rally has been viewed nearly 30, 000 times between Facebook and YouTube. Tom Ciccotta writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.
