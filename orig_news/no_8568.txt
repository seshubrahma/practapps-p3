Wednesday’s on Fox Business Network’s "Mornings with Maria," Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) laid out what he considered to be the test for any U. S. immigration policy, which he said was, "Does it benefit Americans?"  However, also in that appearance Sessions was asked by host Maria Bartiromo if he thought Republican president   Donald Trump could win the general election later this year. According to Sessions, Trump could win based on the outcome of the Nevada Republican caucuses a night early. "I think so if what happened, it looks like what happened in Nevada last night," Sessions replied. "It looks like working people who may have been voting for Democrats voted for Trump in huge numbers. They say, it’s correct  —   you cannot win an election with the simple Republican base. You have to have a nominee who can reach beyond that base. Trump is reaching out to working Americans in a way others so far have not been able to do. That’s the way you get over 50 percent. I’ve been talking about that for seven years. Our geniuses  —   our consultant geniuses said you have got to be more moderate and you have to more amnesty and that’s the way to win an election. I think Trump is proving that is not so. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
