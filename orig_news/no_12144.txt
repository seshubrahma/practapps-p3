Friday on the "Rush Limbaugh Show," while discussing the   mob attacking presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s supporters while they were trying to leave a campaign rally in San Jose, CA, last night, the conservative talk show host said, "Breitbart News was there. Breitbart News is everywhere. Breitbart News Daily is everywhere. "  Limbaugh said, "The mayor of San Jose, and his name is [Sam] Liccardo, and he actually said last night, quote, ‘At some point Donald Trump needs to take responsibility for the irresponsible behavior of his campaign.’  His [Trump’s] people didn’t do diddly squat last night. They were inside the Trump rally, they came out and they were attacked and beaten up and bloodied up and  bullied and followed to their cars wherever they were parked. And here comes this mayor saying, ‘At some point Trump needs to take responsibility for the irresponsible behavior his campaign. ’" He continued,  "Breitbart News was there. Breitbart News is everywhere. Breitbart News Daily is everywhere. And they said they saw several Trump supporters thanking the cops as they left the venue. In fact, one Trump supporter was supposedly shouting ‘police lives matter’ and an officer responded, ‘thank you.’  But the mayor  —   according to reports, the mayor had them just standing around like an hour and a half. Did you see that as well? Right. OK. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
