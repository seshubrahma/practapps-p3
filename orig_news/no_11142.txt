Conservative movement leader Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, is expressing the deep disappointment that she feels in Ted Cruz. [Fellow conservative movement veteran Richard Viguerie, who was a staunch   in the primary, published a piece on his website stating:  Failing to endorse the Trump  —   Pence ticket  …    was not good for Ted Cruz, conservatives, Republicans, and America  …    And most importantly for those of us who endorsed Ted Cruz and worked for him in the Republican primaries, he betrayed the trust we gave him that he was a bigger man than his attackers and that there was a cause greater than self in the   battles of the Republican primaries. Thomas weighed in on Facebook, stating: Richard Viguerie speaks for me here, as a former Ted Cruz supporter who spent time as a surrogate. I thought he cared about more of the country than he ended up caring about.   2016 now. Since Cruz’s convention snub of Trump, the Texas senator has lost a lot of supporters, but he remains a star within the dwindling #NeverTrump movement. "Ted Cruz Sucks  …    Hillary Swallows"   made the rounds on Cleveland’s Fourth Avenue after Cruz’s speech.
