Sunday on ABC’s "This Week," Weekly Standard editor and "Never Trump" advocate Bill Kristol said about   Donald Trump defeating both Jeb Bush in the primary and Hillary Clinton in the general election, "Whatever one thinks of Donald Trump, that’s pretty impressive. "  Kristol said, "I mean I think he will do something on immigration. He will try to renegotiate the trade deals a little bit. There are a few things he’s been pretty clear he’ll do. A big infrastructure program that he’ll get bipartisan support for. Republican Congressmen and senators will be in a very interesting place, where they have to support the    —   president  —   what will be President Trump when they  —   when they agree with him, try to guide him in certain ways, I think oppose him on some things. " "It will be an unusual dynamic," he continued. "It won’t be like the rallying behind President Obama in 2009 or behind President Bush, even at the beginning of his presidency, or even Clinton in ’93, when he got his budget through on a partisan vote. I think it will be a very in  —   unusual dynamic. It’s been an unusual election. The main thing for me, just one point, though. You know, I was "Never Trump. " But it turned out never dynasty was really the theme of this election. If you think about it, Donald Trump  …     whatever one  —   but not just change. I mean defeating Bush and then Clinton, whatever one thinks of Donald Trump, that’s pretty impressive. (  RCP Video) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
