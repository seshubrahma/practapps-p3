Donald Trump declares that his rival Hillary Clinton will be disqualified to run for president if she doesn’t apologize and retract her statements calling millions of Americans racist  —   among other labels  —   by suggesting they could all be put into a "basket of deplorables. "["The disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed toward millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service," the Republican nominee says, speaking speaking in Baltimore to the  National Guard Association of the United States 138th General Conference  Exhibition.  He continued: You cannot run for president if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter and she does. You can’t lead this nation if you have such a low opinion for its citizens. Hillary Clinton still hasn’t apologized to those she slandered  —   in fact  —   she hasn’t backed down at all. "If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, I don’t see how she can credibly campaign any further," the New Yorker declared about the former secretary of state. "These were not off hand comments from Hillary Clinton," he added, noting these were prepared remarks that showed a "total disrespect for the people of our country. " "I am running to be a president for all Americans," Trump vowed. "All Americans  —   you know what I mean. " He said he was "deeply shocked" by his opponent’s statements, saying that she attacked, slandered and demeaned "these wonderful amazing people who are supporting our campaign by the millions"  —   people Trump says want a better future. "These were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized. These we’re among the countless Americans that HillaryClinton called deplorable, irredeemable and  . Nobody has heard anything like this. " "Hillary Clinton is an insider supported by powerful insiders attacking Americans who have absolutely no political power," he jabbed, saying he wants to be a voice for all Americans that seek change.
