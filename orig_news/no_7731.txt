"The policy team is reviewing a number of different options for day one executive order as well as additional executive orders during the first 100 days," Miller told reporters.  "There’s not yet been a final list that’s put forward, but as most of you saw Stephen Miller, who is our national policy director, [  …    ] is working with a team to get those put together. " Miller added there’s no announcement yet regarding the Planned Parenthood rule, but to stay tuned. According to NBC News, the Obama administration finalized the new rule on Wednesday by the U. S.
