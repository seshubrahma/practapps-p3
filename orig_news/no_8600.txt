On the third night of the Democratic convention, a speaker finally brought up defeating ISIS and other terrorists  —   only to be met with boos from the crowd. [This story originally appeared at the New York Post.  "These murderers must be stopped," declared former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director Leon Panetta. Cue the deafening chorus of boos, plus chants of "No more war!" from convention delegates. Mind you, Panetta’s speech was offering yet another broadside against Donald Trump’s inexperience. "This is no time to gamble with our future. America faces flash points and threats from around the globe," the   warned. "Lies, lies, lies," the delegates replied. Yes, it was a minority of the hall, but definitely a loud one. And when convention managers resorted to dousing the lights over the delegations doing the most jeering, the delegates started flashing their cellphone lights and continued to drown out Panetta. Which helps explain why no speaker brought up the terrorist threat  —   or groups like Boko Haram and ISIS  —   on the first two nights. Read the full story at the New York Post.
