A woman wearing a Moms Demand Action button on her lapel told Inside Edition that the depiction of President Trump being murdered on stage is just "theater" and "everybody knows it’s theater. "[The comments come as Delta, Bank of America, and other sponsors withdraw funding the New York City Theater company over a ‘Julius Caesar’ adaptation in which a man who looks a lot like President Trump is depicted as stabbed to death on stage.
