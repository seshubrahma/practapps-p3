An episode of Netflix animated children’s television series All Hail King Julien will satirize presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s pledge to build a wall on the U. S.  border. [In an episode of the popular   program’s third season, lemur King Julien  —   a character from the Madagascar series of animated films  —   rallies his constituents to build a wall around their land in order to keep foreign animals out.  While they build, the lemurs sing a song titled, "Don’t Touch Our Stuff. "  In an interview with the Huffington Post, All Hail showrunner Mitch Watson said that the episode is meant to be a direct commentary on Trump’s signature policy proposal. "The song ‘Don’t Touch Our Stuff’ is essentially about building a wall to keep other animals away because Julien and the lemurs feel they are taking away their jobs even though the lemurs don’t work, and taking their housing even through there are plenty of trees, and eating their food even though there is more than enough for everyone," Watson told the outlet. "Lemurs mean just what they  ’t touch our stuff, and just go away," the animated creatures sing cheerfully as they construct the wall. It wasn’t immediately clear how the episode resolves. The third season of All Hail premieres Friday on Netflix. Watson told the Huffington Post that the team behind the series "specifically wanted stories that had some kind of social satire. " He added that the show had already taken on contentious issues like gun control, income inequality and trigger warnings. "DreamWorks and Netflix have been very supportive about the kind of stories we wanted to tell on the show," Watson told the outlet. The All Hail creative team aren’t the only ones warning young children about the potential dangers of a President Trump comedian Michael Ian Black is set to release a "children’s book" about the candidate, A Child’s First Book of Trump, in July.
