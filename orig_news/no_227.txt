Right Now: See the latest highlights in our Inauguration Briefing. Donald J. Trump took the oath of office outside the Capitol on Friday to become the 45th president of the United States. There was plenty of pomp and a good deal of protest, too, as hundreds of thousands of people descended on Washington to mark the occasion. Here is a guide to the week’s festivities, demonstrations and much more. The official inaugural festivities commenced Thursday afternoon and do not wrap up until Saturday morning. Below are some of the highlights and here is an expanded schedule. FRIDAY, INAUGURATION DAY 11:30 a. m. |   ceremony  American officials and other dignitaries gathered on the West Front of the Capitol for the official inauguration ceremony. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administered the oath of office, and Mr. Trump delivered his inaugural address.

Washington Convention Center, and the Armed Services Ball, which will be at the National Building Museum. Mr. Trump is expected to make remarks and take to the dance floor at all three.

Be prepared for significant security and traffic delays. Here is more information on how to attend in person. As Mr. Trump takes office on Friday, he is less popular than any new president in modern American history, according to a series of surveys published in recent days. The numbers suggest that rather than unifying a divided electorate, his transition to power has continued the polarization from the campaign. Polls released on Tuesday by CNN and ORC and by The Washington Post and ABC News found that just 40 percent of Americans approved of the job Mr. Trump has been doing during the transition. Mr. Trump’s aides say they have had that atmosphere in mind while planning the week’s festivities. More than 60 Democrats in the House of Representatives said they would not attend the ceremony  —   many of them citing Mr. Trump’s recent criticism of Representative John Lewis, a civil rights icon. A   security bubble has encircled much of downtown Washington, as almost 30, 000 local, state and federal officials work to ensure that the transfer of power goes off without a hitch. The authorities began enforcing a soft and a hard perimeter in central Washington in the early hours of Friday morning, and other road closings around the region followed. Only local vehicles were allowed within the soft perimeter. No civilian vehicles could pass inside the hard perimeter, where federal security forces were screening anyone hoping to enter by foot. To assure security, many items, including backpacks and posters, are prohibited on the Capitol grounds, along the parade route and at the inaugural balls. The National Park Service decided on Thursday to allow small umbrellas onto the National Mall and parade route because of rain in the forecast. The official   ceremony began on Friday on the West Front of the Capitol overlooking the Mall. Most of the nation’s dignitaries were on hand, including Mr. Trump’s presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Jackie Evancho, a    singer best known from "America’s Got Talent," performed the national anthem. And six religious leaders chosen by Mr. Trump offered blessings. As Chief Justice Roberts administered the oath of office, Mr. Trump rested his hand on two Bibles: his childhood Bible and the Lincoln Bible, which Mr. Obama also used. Mr. Trump recited the 35 words mandated by the Constitution: He then delivered his inaugural address. After they officially review the armed services Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence will lead a parade on Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House. A tradition since Thomas Jefferson’s inauguration in 1801, the parade is one of the inauguration’s highlights and typically draws large crowds and TV viewers around the country. More than 8, 000 people will march behind the president and vice president, according to the Presidential Inaugural Committee, including representatives of each branch of the American armed services, as well as high school, college and police bands that have volunteered to perform. This year’s parade is expected to be considerably shorter  —   about 90 minutes  —   than those celebrating Mr. Trump’s recent predecessors. It will also pass a certain conspicuous building that bears the name of the 45th president. Come nightfall, many of the inaugural revelers will dress in their best evening wear to attend balls across the capital  —   including some to galvanize resistance to Mr. Trump. All in all, the night should be tamer than eight years ago, when the Obamas attended 10 official inaugural balls and supporters held scores of others. Mr. Trump will attend just three official balls himself. Two of those, "Liberty" and "Freedom," will take place at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center and are available to supporters who donated to his inauguration or purchased tickets. The third, the "Salute to Our Armed Services Ball," will be at the National Building Museum for active duty and reserve military members, wounded veterans, emergency medical workers and Medal of Honor recipients. Mr. Trump will deliver remarks at all three balls and, as is customary, he will oblige the attendees with a ceremonial first dance with his wife, Melania. Protesters are not unusual at an inauguration, but Mr. Trump’s is expected to attract many more than usual. Law enforcement officials said they were expecting 99 groups to carry out demonstrations of all sorts over the inaugural period, including 63 on Friday. The largest event by far will be the Women’s March on Washington, which is on Saturday and is expected to attract several hundred thousand people. Beginning with a rally at 10 a. m. at Independence Avenue and Third Street SW, near the Capitol, the march is intended to raise awareness about a variety of social issues. Here’s what you need to know. Other protests will be scattered throughout the city. Two of the largest are Inaugurate the Resistance and #DisruptJ20.
