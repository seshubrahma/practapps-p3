Thursday on the Fox Business Network, Katrina Pierson, the national spokeswoman for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, explained to Fox Business Network’s Charles Payne that Breitbart was right to stand by its reporter Michelle Fields in the wake of the controversy involving her being allegedly assault by Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.  However, she was skeptical of the assaulter having been Lewandowski and suggested it might have been another reporter. "[Breitbart] should stand by their reporter, because if she says someone grabbed her, he probably did grab her," Pierson said. "Where I take issue is that Corey Lewandowski of all people was pointed out on this particular issue and the transcript that was posted  —   and I’ll note that it was said even then that it was not substantiated that it was Cory Lewandowski. And if in fact, if it was, it was after the words excuse me and thank you were spoken allegedly by Corey Lewandowski that this happens after the fact. So, essentially no Charles, I don’t buy the fact it was Corey Lewandowski. I do buy the fact that it could have been another reporter in the room trying to get in front of Mr. Trump because I have seen it happen a hundred times myself.
