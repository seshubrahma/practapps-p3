WASHINGTON  —   As he confronted a series of international challenges from the Middle East to Asia last week, President Trump made certain that nothing was certain about his foreign policy. To the extent that a Trump Doctrine is emerging, it seems to be this: don’t get roped in by doctrine. In a week in which he hosted foreign heads of state and launched a cruise missile strike against Syria’s government, Mr. Trump dispensed with his own dogma and forced other world leaders to   their assumptions about how the United States will lead in this new era. He demonstrated a highly improvisational and situational approach that could inject a risky unpredictability into relations with potential antagonists, but he also opened the door to a more traditional American engagement with the world that eases allies’ fears. As a private citizen and candidate, Mr. Trump spent years arguing that Syria’s civil war was not America’s problem, that Russia should be a friend, and that China was an "enemy" whose leaders should not be invited to dinner. As president, Mr. Trump, in the space of just days, involved America more directly in the Syrian morass than ever before, opened a new acrimonious rift with Russia, and invited China’s leader for a largely convivial, let’   dinner at his Florida estate. In the process, Mr. Trump upended domestic politics as well. He rejected the nationalist wing of his own White House, led by Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, who opposes entanglement in Middle East conflicts beyond fighting terrorism and favors punitive trade measures against Beijing. And Mr. Trump, by launching the strike on Russia’s ally Syria, undercut critics who have portrayed him as a Manchurian candidate doing the bidding of President Vladimir V. Putin after the Kremlin intervened in last year’s election on his behalf. Given his unpredictability, none of this means that Mr. Trump has pivoted permanently in any of these areas. The White House has prepared an executive order that the president may sign in the coming days targeting countries like China that dump steel in the American market. And Mr. Trump is sending Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson on Tuesday to Moscow, where he will have the additional task of trying to smooth over the rancor of recent days, in addition to exploring whether Russia could be a real partner in battling the Islamic State in Syria. Moreover, the missile strike, in response to a chemical weapons attack, was intended to be a limited,   operation, and the president seemed determined to quickly move on. After announcing the attack Thursday evening, he made no mention of it Friday during public appearances, nor on Saturday during his weekly address. As of Saturday afternoon, the   president had not even taunted President Bashar   of Syria online, although he did thank the American troops who carried out the missile strike and defended the decision not to target the runway at the air base that was hit. "Our decisions," Mr. Trump said in the Saturday address, "will be guided by our values and our goals  —   and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences. " That concept, flexibility, seems key to understanding Mr. Trump. He hates to be boxed in, as he mused in the Rose Garden last week while contemplating the first new military operation of his presidency with geopolitical consequences. "I like to think of myself as a very flexible person," he told reporters. "I don’t have to have one specific way. " He made clear he cherished unpredictability. "I don’t like to say where I’m going and what I’m doing," he said. That flexibility was a hallmark of his rise in real estate, and if critics preferred the word erratic, it did not bother Mr. Trump  —   it has since worked well enough to vault him to the White House. But now that he is commander in chief of the world’s most powerful nation, leaders around the world are trying to detect a method to the man. "There is no emerging doctrine for Trump foreign policy in a classical sense," said Kathleen H. Hicks, a former Pentagon official who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "There are, however, clear emerging characteristics consistent with the attributes of the man himself: unpredictable, instinctual and undisciplined. " On Syria, Mr. Trump had mocked President Barack Obama for setting a "red line" against the use of chemical weapons and urged him not to launch a punitive strike against Syria after Mr. Assad crossed it in 2013. That attack, with a death toll of 1, 400, dwarfed last week’s toll of 84. And just days before last week’s attack, Mr. Tillerson indicated that Washington would accept Mr. Assad’s remaining in power. Indeed, critics, including Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, argued that Mr. Assad felt free to launch a chemical attack precisely because Mr. Trump’s administration had given him a green light. Russia, critics added, did not constrain Mr. Assad because it has had a blank check from an overly friendly Trump administration. And Mr. Trump’s efforts to bar Syrian refugees from the United States, they said, sent a signal that he did not care about them. "President Trump seems not to have thought through any of this, or have any kind of broader strategy, but rather to have launched a military strike based on a sudden, emotional decision," Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote in an article for The Huffington Post on Saturday. Mr. Assad is not the only leader testing Mr. Trump. North Korea has   missile after missile in recent weeks, almost as if trying to get Mr. Trump’s attention. So far, he has been measured in his response, urging President Xi Jinping of China during his visit to do more to rein in North Korea. But national security aides have also prepared options for Mr. Trump if China does not take a more assertive stance, including reintroducing nuclear weapons in South Korea. Mr. Trump’s action in Syria was welcomed by many traditional American allies who had fretted over Mr. Obama’s reluctance to take a greater leadership role in the Middle East, and feared that Mr. Trump would withdraw even more. After the missile strike, Israeli news outlets were filled with headlines like "The Americans Are Back," and European leaders expressed relief both that he had taken action and that he had not gone too far. "We have learned that Trump is not so isolationist as many Europeans feared he would be  —   he appears to care about victims of a gas attack in Syria," said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform in London. "We have learned that he understands that U. S. influence had suffered from the perception  —   which grew under Obama  —   that it was a power weakened by its reluctance to use force. " That touches on another animating factor as Mr. Trump deals with foreign challenges  —   doing the opposite of whatever Mr. Obama did. Mr. Trump’s first instinct after the Syrian chemical attack was to blame Mr. Obama for not enforcing his red line, never mind that Mr. Trump had urged him not to at the time. Even as he announced the missile strike on Thursday night, Mr. Trump asserted that his predecessor’s handling of Syria had "failed very dramatically. " Intentionally or not, though, Mr. Trump adopted language similar to that used by Mr. Obama and many other presidents in defining American priorities. While in the past Mr. Trump said the United States did not have a national interest in Syria, last week he said instability there was "threatening the United States and its allies. " He also said that "America stands for justice," effectively espousing a responsibility to act in cases of human rights abuses, as other presidents have at times. Until now, Mr. Trump has largely eschewed such language. Just three days earlier, he had hosted Egypt’s authoritarian president, Abdel Fattah   and made no public mention of the thousands of people the Cairo government has imprisoned in a political crackdown. "What is striking to me is a subtle yet clear shift away from the rhetoric of pure American   narrowly defined, as espoused by candidate Donald Trump," said Robert Danin, a former Middle East negotiator who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations. "What has emerged is a new language of American leadership in the world that we have not heard before from President Trump. " Mr. Grant and others noted that the strike, coming as Mr. Trump shared a meal with Mr. Xi, could resonate in Asia as well, leaving North Korea to wonder whether the president might resort to force to stop its development of ballistic missiles. But Ms. Hicks said Mr. Trump’s flexibility  —   or unpredictability  —   was itself "extremely risky. " If other countries cannot accurately predict what an American president will do, she said, they may act precipitously, citing the example of China’s extending its maritime claims in the South China Sea. "Imagine if Donald Trump then took exception in ways they didn’t anticipate and major wars ensued," she said. "Bright lines, derived from clear interests and enforced well, are generally best, and I don’t think Donald Trump likes to be constrained by bright lines. "
