During his July 21 speech at the Republican National Convention, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump reasserted his commitment to protect the Second Amendment while warning that Hillary Clinton would "abolish" it. [Trump also spoke to the kind of justice he would nominate to replace Antonin Scalia, assuring Republicans that he will choose someone who shares Scalia’s "principles. "  Trump said: The replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe. Trump’s emphasis on defending the Second Amendment has a been constant theme throughout his presidential campaign. From his April 2015 pledge to maintain the Second Amendment "in its strongest form" to his July 1 speech at the Western Conservative Summit, where he reiterated the pride he takes in working with the NRA and assured conference attendees, "We’re saving your Second Amendment 100 percent. " He continued this emphasis at the RNC, promising anew to "protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.
