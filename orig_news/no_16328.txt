Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton has widened her lead over Donald Trump to 10 points in the wake of the Democratic convention, according to a new national poll. Clinton leads Trump 49% to 39% in a    Fox News survey released Wednesday. In a   race including Libertarian Gary Johnson, Clinton leads 44% to 35% with Johnson claiming 12%. Clinton has enjoyed a bounce following her convention last week, and the Fox News survey shows one of the largest leads in general election polls yet. A   poll this week showed Clinton with a   edge in a    matchup with Trump. When Fox polled voters in late June    before both conventions    Clinton was up only six points, 44% to 38%. Voters also weighed in on the controversy surrounding Trump after he disparaged the Muslim family of a fallen US soldier.    percent of respondents familiar with the comments declared Trump’s criticism in response to the family’s speech against Trump at the Democratic convention "out of bounds," compared to 19% who said it was "in bounds."  Republicans are about evenly split on the    with 41% saying similarly while 40% of Republicans saying Trump’s response is "in bounds." Fox surveyed 1, 022 registered voters from Sunday to Tuesday, and the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
