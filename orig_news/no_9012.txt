Former failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney tried to get failed Republican presidential nominee John Kasich to mount a   run against presumptive nominee Donald Trump. ["Romney sent [Kasich] an email first urging him to run as an independent and saying he would do anything he needed to help," a Kasich adviser told Yahoo News reporter Jon Ward.   The Kasich advisor revealed that Trump and Kasich spoke on the phone afterwards but that the Ohio governor "demurred. " The Washington Post reports that Romney also reached out personally to   Republican Sen. Ben Sasse to encourage him to run. According to Wardâ€™s report, Romney has ruled out the possibility that he will mount an independent campaign himself.
