Asked if it bothers him that someone like Garrett supports Trump, Santos said, "It bothers me anywhere that they support anybody. It’s their right but we don’t need to interview that person." One woman got in front of the cameras.  "I don’t care what color people are if they love America," she said. "This guy is an idiot!" Another woman, Carleen Reich Simko, said "there were so many thousands of other people here without this white supremacy label." Garrett was wearing a shirt with the label for the State of Jefferson, a secession movement in California.

"We do not support that garbage at all," Turner said, visibly upset at the incident.
