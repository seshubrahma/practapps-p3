’  ’ ’   Former Florida Congressman Allen West wrote  Wednesday that he was   "delighted" the FBI will not recommend charges against Hillary   Clinton for her use of a private email system as secretary of   state. ’ ’   "I can’’t thank Director [James] Comey enough for coming to this   decision," West wrote. ’ ’   The conservative firebrand said he "always" had "concern"   President Barack Obama would "release the hounds" on Clinton in   an effort to replace her as the presumptive Democratic nominee   with Vice President Joe Biden. ’ ’   Biden, West contended, would have been far more difficult for   Donald Trump to defeat in November. ’ ’   "That would be a really tough ticket to beat, since Joe Biden’’s   favorables, regardless of gaffes and such, are extremely high,"   West wrote. ’ ’’ ’   West wrote that Comey had instead opted to leave Clinton in the   race as a significantly damaged candidate  —   a "gift wrapped with   a bow" to Republicans. ’ ’   Comey  that 110 emails that   traversed Clinton’’s private email server had classified   information at the time they were sent or received. He called her   behavior "extremely careless" and said it was "possible" that   "hostile actors" had gained access to her account. ’ ’   Nevertheless, the agency director said "no reasonable prosecutor"   would bring charges against her and that the bureau would not   recommend doing so. ’ "   Attorney General Loretta Lynch indicated last week that she would   likely accept the FBI’s recommendation. " ’   Both Comey and Lynch are  before Congress this month. ’
