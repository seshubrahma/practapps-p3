Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by just 42 percent to 40 percent, with 10 percent for libertarian Gary Johnson, according to a poll sponsored by George Washington University.

He is viewed unfavorably by a sizable majority (58%) of the electorate and has a "strongly" unfavorable image with a majority (50%) of voters. Additionally, Clinton has   percent (42%) support on the ballot test and only   percent of voters say they are willing to consider voting for her. For Trump, he is at forty percent (40%) support on the ballot and   percent of voters indicate that they willing to consider voting for him. So, barring some major shift in how these two candidates are perceived, each candidate will spend tens of millions of dollars and thousands of hours pursuing a very narrow five or six percent of the electorate that is willing to consider them but not yet supporting them.
