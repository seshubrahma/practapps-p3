"He said he had nothing to do with   Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had   always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia." ’ ’   A dossier prepared by a former British intelligence official that   alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia contained an   unverified claim that  to perform lewd acts in a Moscow     presidential suite. Trump has publicly dismissed the dossier as   "fake news." ’ ’   Comey said in his remarks that during a dinner on January 27,   Trump "expressed his disgust for the allegations" and said he was   considering ordering Comey "to investigate the alleged incident   to prove it didn’’t happen." Comey said he told Trump that   ordering such an investigation "might create a narrative" that   the FBI was investigating him personally, which it wasn’’t, and   that it was "very difficult to prove a negative," according to   the remarks. ’ ’   Trump  on May 9 via a letter. . ’ ’ ’ ’Former FBI Director James Comey will tell the. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
