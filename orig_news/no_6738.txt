" Caddell cited the immigration debate as an example, saying the American people support Trump’s efforts "pretty significantly, as they have all through the election. "  Added Caddell, "It’s not about banning Muslims," although that seems to be what the media would have Americans believe. "This politics has been reduced to tribal warfare, and tribal warfare will bring this country down," said Caddell. Caddell also defended Trump’s recent comments on the judiciary, as well as the judge who blocked Trump’s immigration order.
