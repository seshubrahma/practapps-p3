After an   super PAC created an online attack ad that shamed the former fashion model for posing nude in GQ in 2000, Trump fought back by warning that he would "spill the beans" on Sen. Ted Cruz’s wife Heidi. Lyin’ Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G. Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin’ Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2016,  During an escalating war of words between the two candidates, Trump retweeted an image of Heidi Cruz and Melania Trump    that was captioned, "No need to ‘spill the beans’   …     the images are worth a thousand words.
