’  ’ ’   The US publicly accused the Russian government of orchestrating a   series of cyber attacks on US citizens and political   organizations for the first time on Friday, stating that   " ’ ’   "The US Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the   Russian Government directed the recent compromises of     from US persons and institutions, including from US political   organizations," the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the   Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a   statement. ’ ’   The statement comes after a week of tension between the US and   Russia over Syria, and amid months of highly publicized cyber   attacks and email leaks targeting the Democratic   National Committee.    ’ ’   US voting systems across the US have also been targeted by   hackers over the past few months, but the DHS did not   explicitly link those incidents back to the Russian government in   its statement on Friday. ’ ’  ’ ’   It is unclear what the US government will do to retaliate against   Russia. The Obama administration has been weighing various   measures,  ’ ’  ’ ’   When asked earlier this week about how the US should respond to   reports that its   systems have been targeted, Donald   Trump replied that the US should retaliate aggressively and go   "on the offensive." ’ ’   Cyber security experts are divided over whether a more offensive   posture would deter potential hackers, or if it would   escalate the global cyber war further. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’Every time you escalate a cyber conflict, instead   of trying to do the opposite, you raise the risk level for more   businesses to end up as collateral damage. Foreign governments   may also believe they are justified in targeting things like   critical infrastructure, if they consider themselves to be   engaged in an actual cyber war." ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’
