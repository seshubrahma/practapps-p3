How did this   voter get airtime on MSNBC? 10:00: New York Times: Messrs. Rubio, Schumer convinced Fox News to give   Gang of Eight Senators "breathing room" on comprehensive amnesty bill: A few weeks after Senator Marco Rubio joined a bipartisan push for an immigration overhaul in 2013, he arrived alongside Senator Chuck Schumer at the executive dining room of News Corporation’s Manhattan headquarters for dinner. Their mission was to persuade Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the media empire, and Roger Ailes, the chairman and chief executive of its Fox News division, to keep the network’s   personalities from savaging the legislation and give it a fighting chance at survival. Mr. Murdoch, an advocate of immigration reform, and Mr. Ailes, his top lieutenant and the most powerful man in conservative television, agreed at the Jan. 17, 2013, meeting to give the senators some breathing room. But the media executives, highly attuned to the intensifying anger in the Republican grass roots, warned that the senators also needed to make their case to Rush Limbaugh, the king of conservative talk radio, who held enormous sway with the party’s largely   base. [  …    ] The dinner at News Corporation headquarters  —   which has not been previously reported  —   and the subsequent outreach to Mr. Limbaugh illustrate the degree to which Mr. Rubio served as the chief envoy to the conservative media for the group supporting the legislation. The bill would have provided a pathway to American citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants along with measures to secure the borders and ensure that foreigners left the United States upon the expiration of their visas. It is a history that Mr. Rubio is not eager to highlight as he takes on Donald J. Trump, his rival for the Republican presidential nomination, who has made his vow to crack down on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign.

He rails against   "sexism" that women still face. He also says "this campaign is listening to the   community. They are asking how does it happen in this country  …     that we have more people in jail than in any other country on earth. " He rails against institutional racism. He says his campaign is also listening to our "brothers and sisters in the Latino community" who are tired of being exploited, living in the shadows, and seeing their friends and family get deported. 9:42: Sanders says his campaign is doing well because "we are listening to the pain and the needs of ordinary people and  not to the needs of billionaire campaign contributors. " 9:35: In Minnesota, Sanders says the campaign is about "transforming America" and "thinking big. " He says that in the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth in the wrong direction. Sanders accuses Republican lawmakers of making it harder for people to vote to "get out of politics and get another job" if they fear free and fair elections.

They make "anger" seem   re: Hillary and something destructive when speaking about Trump supporters who are "angry" at Washington. Flashback: Anger gets people to the polls: A 2011 University of Michigan study found that anger actually motivates people to vote. "Anger in politics can play a particularly vital role, motivating some people to participate in ways they might ordinarily not," Nicholas Valentino, the study’s lead author and a professor of communication studies and political science, said. "We normally think people with a lot of resources and political skills are the ones who participate, but many citizens in this category regularly abstain from politics. Furthermore, many citizens with few resources can be mobilized if they experience strong anger. " Valentino added that "anger leads citizens to harness existing skills and resources in a given election. Therefore, the process by which emotions are produced in each campaign can powerfully alter electoral outcomes. " 8:43: That’s why they do it.

But she   if there is a pop quiz or anything on the test that she has not prepared for in advance. She won’t be able to gameplan for Trump like she can for predictable candidates like Rubio and Cruz because, frankly, Trump is so unconventional.

Clinton says don’t let anyone tell  you you can’t  make things in America. I know we can and I know we will. Clinton also rails against "systemic racism" that still "plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind. " She talks about criminal justice reform and immigration reform. "Opportunity, dignity, and justice" for everyone she says. She also thanks five mothers whose sons were killed by   violence —  including Trayvon Martin’s —  who campaigned for her across South Carolina. 7:52: Clinton says   Street will "pay a price" if they turn their backs on America. 7:51: Clinton also says this victory for the entrepreneur who told her more dreams die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else.

" Typical liberals engaging in stereotypes: Dot Scott, the president of the NAACP’s Charleston branch, was similarly critical of Sanders’ team. Scott, who admitted being family friends with Clinton’s South Carolina state director, said she only had one contact with the Sanders campaign, and it went "sour. " Like many South Carolinians, Scott has received calls at home from phone bankers. She said one of these entreaties from the Sanders campaign led her to go off on a   tirade and demand an apology. "One of my experiences that I think I won’t forget for a long time is a call that I got from the Sanders campaign. This person that called asked me was I voting for Sen. Sanders. I said no. I was voting for Secretary Clinton. The phone went silent for a little bit," Scott recounted. "You could hear this person struggling to come up with what they’re going to say next.   …     They call that a real pregnant pause, nine months’ worth of pregnant pause. And he finally came back and he says to me, ‘You know, Senator Sanders is for welfare. ’" This did not provoke a positive reaction from Scott. "I lost it. So you’re going to assume either from my voice or from my selection that the most important thing that Senator Sanders is going to be working on that would interest me is more welfare?" Scott said. "I went on to read him the riot act. Listen, I’m not only a college graduate I’ve got a masters. My daughter is a college graduate. I have never had one ounce of welfare before. I ain’t never lived in public housing. None of those things. " According to Scott, the Sanders supporter who called her "didn’t know what to say. " "By the time he hung up, it was t10n minutes later," she said. "I got one of the managers to call me back and apologize.

Marco Rubio of stealing from the Florida Republican Party and suggested Rubio should have been "indicted" for using a state party American Express card for personal expenses. "Rubio stole from the Republican Party," Trump said of Rubio, with whom he has recently engaged in a public war of words. Rubio used a corporate American Express card that the Florida state GOP entrusted to him during his time as a Florida state lawmaker for tens of thousands of dollars in personal expenses, which he later reimbursed. In November, Rubio released nearly two years of statements for the card, hoping to put to rest any lingering questions of impropriety. Trump suggested on Saturday that Rubio only reimbursed the funds after he was caught. "For some reason, he didn’t get indicted. Why didn’t he get indicted?" Trump asked. 3:10: The real reason why GOP elites may hate Trump and love Rubio: Opposition to the Trump Wall drives much of the GOP elite’s   effort.

As Rubio attacks Trump University  …    Bloomberg reported last year: Last summer, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida asked the U. S. Department of Education to "demonstrate leniency" toward Corinthian Colleges by permitting the wealthy   company to continue accessing millions of dollars in federal financial aid while it was cooperating with a federal investigation. Ten months later, the company shuttered its remaining 28 campuses, instantly displacing some 16, 000 students just days after it was fined $30 million by the Department of Education for a scheme involving "confirmed cases of misrepresentation of job placement rates" for as many as 947 students. The decision to close shop came after years of federal and state investigations into the company. The   Republican presidential candidate had made his plea in a letter —  obtained by Bloomberg Politics —  dated June 20, 2014 and addressed to Jim Shelton, the deputy secretary of education, and Ted Mitchell, the undersecretary for   education. "It has been brought to my attention that the U. S. Department of Education has recently placed extreme financial constraints on Corinthian Colleges, Inc. by restricting the company’s timely access to federal financial aid. It is my understanding the the Department of Education has requested extensive documents be provided by Corinthian Colleges for review, and Corinthian has acted in good faith to try to provide these documents as expeditiously as possible," Rubio wrote. "While I commend the Department’s desire to protect our nation’s students from fraudulent and malicious activity by any institution of higher education, regardless of tax status, I believe the Department can and should demonstrate leniency as long as Corinthian Colleges, Inc. continues to expeditiously and earnestly cooperate by providing the documents requested.
