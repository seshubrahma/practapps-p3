Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends," former Gov. Mike Huckabee ( ) said the former Gov. Mitt Romney ( ) must "repudiate" everything he has said about   Donald Trump before he could be Trump’s secretary of state or it "would be an insult to all those Donald Trump voters who worked really hard. "  Huckabee said,"It’s not about that I don’t care for Mitt personally, but I am still unhappy that Mitt did everything he could to derail Donald Trump. He didn’t just go after him from a point of saying I disagree with his policy on immigration, I disagree with his policy on taxes. He attacked him on a personal level about his character, integrity, his honor. When you do that, there’s only one way that I think Mitt Romney could even be considered for a post like that and that is he goes to a microphone in a very public place, and he repudiates everything he said in that famous Salt Lake City speech. " "And everything he’s said after that where he said that Donald Trump wasn’t fit. that he lacked chararter I mean on and on," he continued. "That’s beyond the normal political infighting that we all experience. Political infighting is part of the game. But when you go after the person who is the nominee of your party, who has been duly nominated by the voters and then you’re savaging the voters, you’re not just savaging Donald Trump. And so it would be an insult to all those Donald Trump voters who worked really hard, that’s what I think he has to stop and consider. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
