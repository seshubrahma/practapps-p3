So many things she would be so good. Nobody could do better than her. I just have to see whether or not she can do that. She would like to do that. " On Kushner, Trump said, "I’d love to have Jared helping us on deals with other nations and see if we can do peace in the Middle East. He’s very talented, he’s a very talented guy.
