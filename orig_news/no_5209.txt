Tuesday at a discussion hosted by the Commonwealth Club, Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( ) said  that it was "hard" for her to say the words "President Trump. "  When Pelosi referenced "the new president of the United States," the moderator said, "I noticed you don’t say President Trump. " Pelosi replied, "It’s hard. " She then acknowledged, "I’m the   woman politically in our country to be Speaker of the House. President, Vice President, Speaker of the House  —   it’s the third highest position. And leader is a very significant position. One of the things that I was looking forward to [on] election day was when finally there would be a woman who would be the highest ranking woman practically in the world as president of the United States. So it was a blow, I mean, for the country. And so it’s hard because I don’t know, from what I’ve seen, I don’t know how much respect he has for the job.
