More than a hundred members of the Special Forces community signed a letter of endorsement for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that was delivered by hand to Trump Tower in New York City on the 15th anniversary of the   terror attacks. The President and founder of the Kilroy Rising Political Action Committee Scott Kesterson delivered the letter at exactly 8:46am, the same time that the first plane struck the World Trade Center in 2001. ["This letter is significant because these aren’t people who usually weigh in on politics," Kesterson told Breitbart News after delivering the letter. "Members of this community value their anonymity and that so many were willing to sign this letter shows just how critical this election is for the safety and security of our nation. I hope people will understand the magnitude of this letter and the people who signed it before they make their decision who to vote for. "  In the letter, Kilroy Rising PAC describes itself as "Special Operations veterans political action group," and frames the election between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as a choice between having a nation and globalism. "Donald Trump is campaigning to secure our borders and maintain our sovereignty while Clinton is part of the   globalist crowd," Kesterson continued. "Without borders, we don’t have a country. " The letter also cites General Mike Flynn’s support of Trump as another reason the group is endorsing Trump. The letter calls Flynn "one of America’s great generals," and a man of "unquestioned integrity and loyalty. " Kesterson stressed the importance of the   officers who signed the letter saying, "getting the endorsement of generals is great but to have so many Sergeants sign this letter is something special. They are the tip of the spear. " The full text of the letter and the list of signatories can be found below. Letter of Endorsement for Donald J. Trump, What do you believe in so much that you are willing to sacrifice everything to defend? America has been changed. The past 7 + years of an insurgent Presidency has fractured and divided the country in ways unseen since the Civil War. We now stand at a precipice of change. We will never fully return to the past but we must now choose between remaining a nation and salvaging our Republic, or be transformed by a Leftist insurgency into a Global colony. Today, we make our voices known. Kilroy Rising is a Special Operations veterans political action group linked with Veterans organizations from all services. All of us are proud Americans representing the melting pot. We are mobilizing across the country to support local community groups to empower their vote, share their stories and become connected as a unified front to stop the progressive left madness that has taken root across our country. We have served this country. We have fought for this country. We have bled for this country. We have struggled for our nation that was entrusted to our leaders who have been quietly serving their own   of the ruling and intellectual elite, forgetting what this country was built upon and who it was built for. While we were protecting Americans and the values of this country we have come to realize that our greatest threat was here at home. This year’s presidential election is not about parties, but a choice between two things: ensuring we have a nation or becoming part of a global one world government. We must all now choose. To that end, there is only one candidate: Donald J. Trump. And for those that question Mr. Trump, we point to his support and endorsement by LTG (R) Mike Flynn, one of America’s great Generals, who is a man of unquestioned integrity and loyalty to this great nation. As members of the Special Operations community we have never wavered in our commitment and professional standards required to protect and defend the United States of America, no matter how dangerous the mission. We therefore join LTG (R) Mike Flynn and endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States. Information is now the weapon of choice. We must use it disrupt the cognitive dissonance that has taken hold across the mass of liberal America, to disempower their ideology, rupture their false narratives of progressive racism, and restore the roots of the Constitutional Republic. To honor the mission and legacy of American spirit, we have resurrected an iconic image from WWII. Kilroy Rising is based on the legendary iconic character from WWII  …     "Kilroy" that carried the hearts of America in a time where we fought to protect our nation and the world to vanquish those that sought to destroy us. Kilroy Rising PAC is once again the battle cry of America  …     laughing at the world who expects us to fail, mocking the pundits who believe we will fall, reminding those who rule that true power is with the citizens of this great nation. We will appear at will and without notice across the country as a reminder that we are everywhere speaking the language of Americans and a country united. Those are values we have carried with us and now they are the values embodied in the Kilroy Rising PAC.
