Hillary Clinton compared herself to DC Comics superhero Wonder Woman Tuesday in a video message, which aired at the Women in Film Los Angeles’ Crystal + Lucy Awards in Beverly Hills. [Clinton began by thanking Women in Film for its "commitment to lifting up women directors, producers, writers, composers and executives. " Then the former Democratic presidential nominee suggested that she and Wonder Woman were both on a quest to "save the world. "  "Now I haven’t seen Wonder Woman yet, but I’m going to, in part because it’s directed by the fabulous Patty Jenkins," Clinton said in the video. "But something tells me that a movie about a strong, powerful woman fighting to save the world from a massive international disaster is right up my alley. " Clinton’s taped video remarks were meant to honor actress Elizabeth Banks, who ripped President Donald Trump and stumped for Clinton last year at the Democratic National Convention. "She is such a special person, again, on screen and off," Clinton said of her friend Banks. "You’re not only a creative force in front of the camera and behind it, you are a passionate advocate for women’s equality and opportunity I can vouch for that. " During surprise video to honor @ElizabethBanks, @HillaryClinton offers desire to see @WonderWomanFilm @PattyJenks #CrystalLucys @WomenInFilm pic. twitter.   —   Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) June 14, 2017,  The    Pitch Perfect director and star produced a     "Fight Song" music video that premiered during the second day of the Democratic National Convention in July of last year.
