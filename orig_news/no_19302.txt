’  ’ ’   A top Democrat questioned the  on Friday that it was   reviewing new emails "pertinent" to the probe into Hillary   Clinton’s emails, contending it "played right into the political   campaign of Donald Trump. " ’ ’   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a ranking member of the Senate   Intelligence Committee, said she was "shocked" to read the short   letter FBI Director James Comey wrote to congressional   leaders to notify members that the agency was examining new   emails. ’ ’   "This is particularly troubling since so many questions are   unanswered," Feinstein said in a statement. "It’s unclear whether   these emails have already been reviewed or if Secretary Clinton   sent or received them. In fact, we don’t even know if the FBI has   these emails in its possession. " ’ ’   Feinstein continued: "Without knowing how many emails are   involved, who wrote them, when they were written or their subject   matter, it’s impossible to make any informed judgment on this   development. " ’ ’   The Democratic senator noted Trump was "already using the letter   for political purposes" with just under two weeks remaining until   the election. ’ ’’ "   "Director Comey admits ’the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not   this material may be significant.’ He cannot predict how long the   investigation will take. And we don’t know if the FBI has these   emails in hand," she said. " ’   Feinstein concluded: "It’s too bad Director Comey didn’t take   those gaping holes into consideration when he decided to send   this letter. The FBI has a history of extreme caution near   Election Day so as not to influence the results. Today’s break   from that tradition is appalling. " ’
