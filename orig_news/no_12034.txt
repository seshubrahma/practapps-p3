Billionaire presidential candidate Donald Trump argues that South Korea and China should start addressing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, after the dictator nation claimed that it has successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. [In an interview with Fox News, Trump referred to the 28, 000 American troops who were currently on the border with North Korea  —   and that he would force South Korea to help foot the bill.  "South Korea’s going to have to start ponying up, okay, and we’ll do it in a very nice manner, they’ll like us even more than they like us now," he said. Trump also challenged China to get more involved, accusing their leaders of lying about their inability to stop North Korea. Trump also proposed trade restriction with China to force them into action. "China should solve that problem and if they don’t solve the problem we should make trade very difficult for China," he said. He suggested that the Chinese are propping up North Korea. "Without China, they wouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have food. They wouldn’t have anything," he said. Trump described North Korean dictator Kim   as a "madman" that very few people even talked to —  except for basketball player Dennis Rodman.
