"[The Columbus Dispatch reported that the Columbus City Council voted to adopt an executive order issued by Mayor Andrew J. Ginther in early February.  After he signed the executive order, Mayor Ginther told those at a press conference, "To all of you I say, Columbus is your home. " The mayor’s executive order provided that the city will "actively support, to the greatest extent practicable, the placement or settlement in this jurisdiction of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. " The room was full of leaders from the city’s refugee and immigrant communities, the local NBC affiliate reported.  The mayor’s order dictates: Although the policy prevents the City or employees from using any city property for detecting or apprehending those illegally in the country, or "the use of local taxpayer resources for the enforcement of federal immigration policy," city officials do not declare Columbus a "sanctuary city," reported the Dispatch.

The president of the city council, Zach Klein was reported to say that "The permanence of city code transcends every mayor. " "We decided not to focus on labels and focus more on the substance," he added. The ordinance will be effective after 30 days.
