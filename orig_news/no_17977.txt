’  ’ "   FBI Director James Comey told the US Justice Department on   Saturday to reject President Donald Trump’s baseless claim that   President Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump’s phones,   according to The New York Times. " "   Comey argued that Trump’s claim is false and has no supporting   evidence, The Times reported, citing senior US officials. The   Justice Department has yet to release a statement, however. " ’   Trump made his stunning allegation  morning, apparently referencing an article from the   conservative news site Breitbart. The president raised the stakes   on Sunday by calling for Congress to investigate his claim as   part of its probe into Russian interference during the 2016   election. ’ ’   Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the White House will not comment   on the allegations "until such oversight is conducted." ’ "   Meanwhile, Trump’s request could put Republican lawmakers in an   uncomfortable position. " ’’ ’   "I’’ve never heard that allegation made before by anybody. I’’ve   never seen anything about that anywhere before," Sen. Marco Rubio   . "The president put that   out there, and now the White House will have to answer as to   exactly what he was referring to." ’ "   Earlier this week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself   from investigations involving connections between Trump’s team   and Russia. His recusal leaves few people in the Justice   Department with the power to release a statement on Trump’s   wiretapping claim, according to The Times.
