Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking at a memorial to a Nazi massacre, said that the United States would punish those "who commit crimes against innocents anywhere in the world. " The comments, coming after President Trump bombed Syria in retaliation for a chemical attack, appeared to further shift U. S. foreign policy from a primarily economic focus.

" The crew of Apollo 13, launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on this day in 1970, was 200, 000 miles above Earth when one of its oxygen tanks exploded. The blast either ruptured a line or caused a valve to leak on the other tank. Then the warning lights for the fuel cells began flashing, indicating that the electricity supply was in jeopardy. The mission was supposed to be NASA’s third crewed moon landing. The "problem" came two days in, crippling the command module’s supply of electricity, light and water. The   crew was able to make a series of decisions and improvised repairs to the carbon dioxide removal system, enabling them to use the lunar module as a "lifeboat" to safely return to Earth on April 17. Although the mission was aborted and the crew never landed on the moon, their heroics  —   and their rescue  —   resulted in the mission being classified as a "successful failure. " The flight remains the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth, and the response to the near disaster was deemed "NASA’s finest hour.
