 (CNN) Donald Trump’s campaign fired one of its senior advisers on Monday, multiples sources confirmed to CNN. Ed Brookover, who helped manage the campaign’s delegate operations in the lead up to the Republican National Convention, was fired a little more than six weeks after he was promoted as the campaign’s liaison to the Republican National Committee. The firing comes even as the campaign continues to hire more staff in an effort to build up its political operation less than 100 days before the general election.  "The campaign has parted ways with Ed, but we are thankful to him for his many contributions and appreciate his continued support," the campaign said in a statement. Two Trump campaign aides, Bill McGinley and Mike McSherry, who are both close to Trump’s chief strategist and campaign chairman Paul Manafort, are set to take on expanded roles in the campaign, a senior Trump campaign source told CNN. A source said some state directors were also let go. Politico first reported the news of Brookover’s firing on Monday. Brookover did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The reason for Brookover’s firing was not immediately clear, but two sources pointed to disagreements between Brookover and Manafort, with one senior campaign source saying the two "never saw   ." News of his firing came after weeks of Brookover gradually losing influence in the campaign. One source said Brookover has not been involved in   meetings for weeks, and another said Brookover was axed from the campaign’s list of surrogates about three weeks ago. Brookover joined the Trump campaign about three months earlier after serving as campaign manager to retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who quickly endorsed Trump after dropping out of the Republican presidential race.
