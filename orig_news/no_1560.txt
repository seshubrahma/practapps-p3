(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Donald Trump did not stand down in his feud with the parents of a   soldier killed in Iraq, frustrating some campaign advisers and drawing President Obama’s strongest criticism yet. Mr. Obama urged Republican leaders to pull their support for his candidacy. Mr. Trump deepened tensions with Republican leaders by telling The Washington Post that he was "not quite there yet" in endorsing the reelection bid of Paul Ryan, the House speaker, and that he would not support John McCain either. Both endorsed Mr. Trump but have criticized him. Mr. Trump’s five draft deferments during the Vietnam War, including one for foot trouble, are under new scrutiny. _____ 2. Even before the president’s call, Richard Hanna, a   representative from New York, became the first Republican member of Congress to join forces with Democrats against Mr. Trump.  Seven national polls taken after the Democratic convention show Hillary Clinton leading by an average of nearly seven percentage points. _____ 3. Massachusetts has barred employers from asking about applicants’ salaries before making job offers. The novel law is meant to help close the wage gap between men and women by ensuring that compensation is based on the job’s value to the company, not an applicant’s prior salary. _____ 4. The leader of the largest police force in the U. S. is stepping down. After a    that culminated at the top of the New York City Police Department, William Bratton is taking up a job in the private sector. A leader in trying to resolve the racial distrust afflicting police departments around the country, he will advise business executives on security matters as head of Teneo Risk. _____ 5. More than 450 applications and phone calls from   recruits poured into the Dallas police department within two weeks of the attack that killed five police officers. "Everything going on around the world  —   the crises, communities not really getting along with each other, the protests," one applicant said. "It just kind of hit me. " Above, another applicant, Jaiston Sawyer, a security guard, with his girlfriend and their children. _____ 6. The Philippines has seen a sudden jump in killings related to the new president’s    war on drugs, and an equally sudden drop in crime. Since Rodrigo Duterte was inaugurated just over a month ago, 420 people have been killed, most of them by the police, but more than 150 by unidentified vigilantes. Police logs show that 114, 833 people have turned themselves in as either drug addicts or dealers. Above, a women held her slain partner, next to a sign accusing him of being a drug dealer. _____ 7. Harvard College, once a bastion of elitism, is trying to promote more inclusion. The dean is wrestling with six exclusive,   campus fellowships known as final clubs, which he calls "spaces that are rife with power imbalances. " Soon, students who opt to join any of about 20   clubs, male or female, will be barred from athletics, denied dean’s recommendations for Rhodes and Fulbright scholarships and otherwise penalized. _____ 8. A good chunk of our sports desk has relocated to Rio to cover the Olympics, whose opening ceremonies come Friday. Our reporters noticed that athletes preparing to compete in track and field events are covering the logos on their shoes with tape, markers, elastic sleeves and spray paint. Some are doing it because their official sponsors don’t make the kind of shoes they need. Others don’t want to give nonsponsors free advertising. As one athlete put it, "no representation without compensation. " _____ 9. The buzz is building for "The Underground Railroad," by Colson Whitehead, which comes out in September. The book follows a teenage slave named Cora, who flees a Georgia plantation and tries to evade bounty hunters, informers and lynch mobs. Our reviewer calls it "a potent, almost hallucinatory novel that leaves the reader with a devastating understanding of the terrible human costs of slavery. " _____ 10. It’s been almost five and a half years since an   tsunami killed tens of thousands people in Japan and left many more in unrelenting grief. One of our   articles today looks at the suffering of some of the tsunami’s survivors: Two men who learned to scuba dive to keep up the search for missing loved ones. "If I die," one man told his wife as she fretted over the danger, "throw my ashes in the sea. " _____ 11. Finally, do you floss regularly? A note of reassurance for those cringing in the negative: While the practice has been shown to maintain healthier gums, the association between flossing and dental health has never been proven with randomized trials. In fact, the latest U. S. dietary guidelines quietly dropped mention of flossing. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
