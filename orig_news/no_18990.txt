’  ’ ’   A former spokesman and speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan   took the stage at the Democratic National Convention in   Philadelphia on Thursday to rip Donald Trump and denounce any   comparisons between the Manhattan billionaire and the   conservative icon Reagan. ’ ’   "It’’s an honor to be here; candidly, it’’s also a shock," Doug   Elmets said, according to prepared remarks. "Not because of the   momentous nature of this event, or the size of the crowd. It’’s a   shock because, unlike many of you, I’’m a Republican." ’ "   He said that he’s voted entirely Republican for the past 40 years    —   ever since he first cast a ballot. " ’   "I haven’’t just voted Republican, I worked in President Reagan’’s   White House," he continued. "I recently led an effort to place a   statue of  in    Capitol." ’ ’   "I’’m here tonight to say: I knew Ronald Reagan; I worked for   Ronald Reagan," he continued. "Donald Trump, you are no Ronald   Reagan." ’ ’’ ’   He contrasted Reagan’’s famous demand of Russian leader Mikhail   Gorbachev to "tear down" the Berlin Wall with Trump’’s plan to   build a wall along the   border. ’ ’   "Reagan saw nuance," he said. "Trump sees the world as us vs.   them, where somebody with brown skin or a   name   is likely to blame for our troubles. Reagan knew that a   leader needs diplomacy to steer a safe, prosperous course   forward. Trump is a petulant, dangerously unbalanced reality star   who will coddle tyrants and alienate allies." ’ ’   Elmets said that he shudders to think where Trump will lead the   country. ’ "   But, he added, he doesn’t think that Trump will get the   chance. " ’   "While Hillary holds many policy positions that differ from my   own, her qualifications are indisputable," he said, later adding,   "This year’’s Republican platform is the most alarming I’’ve ever   seen. It’’s laced with         positions that do not represent the views of most   Americans. That is why this year, I will vote for a Democrat   for the first time." ’ ’   He made a call to other Republicans to do the same, saying that   "loyalty to country" matters more than "loyalty to party." ’
