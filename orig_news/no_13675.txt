Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller debated a panel on CNN Friday over how Trump’s gun policy affects  .  Miller explained how Trump will "make sure we have tough on crime policies" to help "communities of color," while Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s policies will have a negative affect in the same areas. "Communities of color have been disproportionately hammered by the toxic cocktail of radical gun control and terrible economic policies that are sending our jobs overseas. Donald Trump is going to turn that around. Donald Trump is also going to make sure we have tough on crime policies. Reckless crime policies that are soft on crime, reduce property values, they drive jobs away, they hurt our schools, these are the policies Hillary supports," Miller said.
