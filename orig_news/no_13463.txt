Numerous congressional staff members have told us about how much of an impact our readers are having on Capitol Hill —  many are hearing you, but the voices must be persistent and louder. Eighty members of Congress, including two Democrats, now support the Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act, with one more congressman and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee signing up since the last update. There’s only one problem: The Republican leadership is stalling it, even though the House version passed the Judiciary Committee. The two new cosponsors are Senator David Perdue ( ) and Rep. Tom Marino ( ). The former is especially significant because he is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee where it is held up. A list of cosponsors and opponents is available at the bottom of this article. Terrorism expert Patrick Poole writes that the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker ( ) has not even held hearings on the bill, much less arranged for it to be voted on. Corker is reportedly being vetted as a potential running mate for Donald Trump. The story is even more discouraging in the House, where support for the bill was proven when it passed the Judiciary Committee. Yet, Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy have not given any public indication that he’ll have the House vote on it. Read the full story at the Clarion Project.
