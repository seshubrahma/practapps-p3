Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump tested out a new nickname for likely Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton on Friday, "Heartless Hillary. "["Hillary wants to disarm vulnerable Americans in   neighborhoods," Trump told the crowd of roughly 7, 000 people attending the   Leadership Forum in Louisville, Kentucky.  Trump said Clinton wants people to be defenseless. "And by the way, you have men and you have women sitting in an apartment, and outside is tremendous crime, tremendous crime of all [kinds] and they need to be protected," Trump added. He said taking a gun away from people makes for an unfair situation because it’s how they can protect themselves. "And that’s why we’re going to call her ‘Heartless Hillary,’" Trump jabbed, adding, "Somehow, I like ‘Crooked Hillary’ better. " "Crooked Hillary" is the nickname Trump previously coined Clinton.
