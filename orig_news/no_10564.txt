The Marco Rubio campaign is trying to set caucus night expectations in Iowa, predicting a third place finish for the candidate, likely below Donald Trump and Ted Cruz who seem to be competing for the top spot. [On CNN, Rubio communications director Alex Conant tried to play down rumors Rubio might do better than expected in the state.  "We don’t see any evidence of that," Conant said. "We’re running against the greatest show on Earth which is Donald Trump and the greatest ground game that Iowa has ever seen with Ted Cruz. " Conan cited Cruz’s consistent high poll numbers and the senator’s confidence he’ll do well in the state. "I expect Marco will come in third, I hope he comes in third. " Conant said. "If he comes in a strong third, I think that makes it clear that this is really a three person race going into New Hampshire which is good for our campaign. " Rubio has faced multiple attacks in the state from his Republican opponents  —   especially from his former mentor Jeb Bush and more recently new attack ads from Senator Ted Cruz, describing him as the "Republican Obama" who supported amnesty. "It’s a little ironic that a first term senator is attacking another first term senator for being a first term senator," Conant said, responding to the ad. "But that’s typical for Ted Cruz who’s really willing to say or do anything to get ahead in this race. "
