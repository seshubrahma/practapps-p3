LeBron James doesn’t make a habit of losing, which might explain why he’s so bad at handling defeat. The current NBA champion and former endorser of Hillary Clinton requested separate accommodations when the Cavaliers travel to New York to play the Knicks. [Apparently, the memory of Clinton’s loss to   Donald Trump is still a little too fresh for "King James. "  According to The Hollywood Reporter, "LeBron James and several teammates have decided not to stay at Trump Soho in lower Manhattan this week. The Cavs booked rooms at the luxury hotel for two days, as the team will play the Knicks on Wednesday. "Cavs general manager David Griffin told the Associated Press that the team has made plans for a "group that wants to be together elsewhere. " Griffin did not say where the players will be staying. " The Cavs defeated Toronto   on Monday night and will arrive in New York on Tuesday. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn
