Following last week’s scenes at Rutgers University, where Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos’ speech was interrupted by   students who smeared fake blood on their face, campus crazies have disrupted an event at the University of Minnesota. [The disruption occurred during a   discussion entitled "CALM DOWN!! Restoring Common Sense to Feminism. " The event, hosted by the conservative campus magazine The Minnesota Republic, featured Yiannopoulos and American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Christina Hoff Sommers.  Shortly after Yiannopoulos began his remarks, a number of   students in the audience stood up and began honking airhorns, chanting "You’re an a**hole. " The rest of the audience responded by drowning out their protests with chants of "Trump! Trump! Trump! ," just as they did at Rutgers. There was no red paint this time: the protesters were escorted outside the auditorium by campus security, while the event’s host informed them that protests were authorised in the plaza. After Yiannopoulos began speaking again, he was interrupted by a second wave of   protesters, who met the same fate. "Don’t give them their coats," Yiannopoulos advised as the protesters left, a    reference to Donald Trump’s method of dealing with hecklers. "We’ll send you your coats in two weeks. " Protests continued outside, where around two dozen   students marched up and down the plaza chanting "Hey hey, ho ho, misogyny has got to go," "trans lives matter," and, "Hate speech, off campus!" among other slogans. Alternative media channel "Unicorn Riot" livestreamed the protest. The outdoor protesters were filmed by an attendee, who was quickly targeted by one of the   mob’s angrier members. In the footage below, the activist can be seen pushing up against the attendee’s camera and repeatedly screaming at the attendee to "get the f*** out of here" and telling him "you probably should have been aborted. " **WARNING: Strong Language** Despite the chaos outside, Yiannopoulos and Sommers’ talk continued peacefully. The speakers covered a number of topics, including the decline of western feminism, the crisis of working class white males, and the rise of Donald Trump.
