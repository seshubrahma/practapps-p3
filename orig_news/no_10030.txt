Friday on his HBO program, host Bill Maher followed up on a tweet in which he called San Francisco 49ers   quarterback Colin Kaepernick an "idiot. "  #colinkapernick is an idiot. I support his protest, but stick to what u know: kneeling and interceptions, and then look up "false equivalency"  —   Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 28, 2016,  During the "Real Time" segment, Maher said Kaepernick was a "fucking idiot," but not for his protests. Instead he said it was due to his series of "false equivalencies" he had made about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. "Let’s go to the point of false equivalency," Maher said. "Because I think it’s very relevant to what you’re talking about. And I have one more fucking idiot I want to get to. I tweeted he is a fucking idiot, and he is  —   Colin Kaepernick. " "He is, he is," Maher continued. "He’s a fucking idiot. I’m for his protest. I’m for him taking the knee. " Maher went through a list of false equivalencies, all of which Maher had said Kaepernick was incorrect to suggest Clinton was as bad as Trump. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
