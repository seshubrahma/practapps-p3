Thursday on ABC’s "The View,"   Joy Behar said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump should be charged with sedition.  Behar said, "Everyone’s talking about how it undermines democracy, but he’s been doing that all along. He’s been praising dictators. He praises Assad, who used chemical weapons on his people. He basically disses our country and our president and praises dictators and people who use chemical weapons on their people. That’s who he is. America knows that now. We all know it. She’s going to win, and that’s it. Because he basically is a traitor. He should be brought up on charges of sedition. Sedition definition —  conduct or speech inciting people to rebel against the authority of a state or a monarch. I think that making jokes about assassinating your fellow  —   what do you call her  —   nominee, Hillary Clinton, is the definition of sedition. If you look on Twitter, all these people are coming out of the woodwork making   tweets, racist tweets. he has incited sedition. He should be brought up on charges.
