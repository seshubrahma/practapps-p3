On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s "Real Time," host Bill Maher reacted to the FBI announcing it was taking a second look into Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails by stating, "I don’t know what they’re going to find, and I don’t care. She’s got a server in her basement. I don’t care if she’s got JonBenét Ramsey in her basement, I’m still not voting for Donald Trump. "  Maher said that "Hillary’s emails are like unreleased Tupac songs. Just when you think they have them all, they found a few more. " After pointing out that the emails came from former Representative Anthony Weiner’s ( ) computer, he stated, "Weiner’s one excuse when he was just sexting was he never actually f*cked anyone. Well, now he has, planet Earth. " Maher concluded, "I don’t know what they’re going to find, and I don’t care. She’s got a server in her basement. I don’t care if she’s got JonBenét Ramsey in her basement, I’m still not voting for Donald Trump. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
