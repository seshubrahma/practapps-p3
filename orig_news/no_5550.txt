On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s "Real Time," host Bill Maher stated that President Trump violates the "Pay your taxes" rule and "I worry that if half the country wants this guy to be president, we do need the UN to step in, or the United Federation of Planets, or something. "  Maher said Trump "violates every rule. Don’t lie. Don’t accuse people of things they’re not guilty of. Don’t boast. Pay your taxes. Serve your country. Don’t be a racist, don’t insult  …    the handicapped people, and other people who are not as lucky to be as   as you are, Donald. I worry that if half the country wants this guy to be president, we do need the UN to step in, or the United Federation of Planets, or something. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
