Republican nominee Donald Trump’s senior communications advisor Jason Miller called presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s running mate Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) "an ethically challenged insider. "["It’s only fitting that Hillary Clinton would select an ethically challenged insider like Tim Kaine who’s personally benefited from the rigged system," Miller stated in a press release on Friday.  He continued: While serving in government, Kaine has taken tens of thousands of dollars in freebies  —   more than $160, 000 in fact  —   on free vacations, free clothes, and free tickets. If you think Crooked Hillary and Corrupt Kaine are going to change anything in Washington, it’s just the opposite. They do well by the current system, while the rest of America gets left behind. The choice has never been clearer  —   Donald Trump calls on us to Believe in America, while the Status Quo ticket of   wants us to believe in a rigged system that enriches them at your expense. Trump also blasted Kaine on Twitter, comparing him to former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell  —   whom Trump referred to as McDonald: Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn’t get indicted while Bob M did?  —   Donald J.
