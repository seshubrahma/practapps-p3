As security parted the masses to give him passage out of the   ballroom, Michelle Fields, a young reporter for   Breitbart News, pressed forward to ask the GOP   a question. I watched as a man with   hair and a suit grabbed her arm and yanked her out of the way. He was Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s    campaign manager. Fields stumbled.   bruises formed on her arm. "I’m just a little spooked," she said, a tear streaming down her face. "No one has grabbed me like that before. " She took my arm and squeezed it hard. "I don’t even want to do it as hard as he did," she said, "because it would hurt. " Here is a Fields’ account of events  and her Tweet  to Trump campaign manager Lewandowski:  —   I guess these just magically appeared on me @CLewandowski_ @realDonaldTrump. So weird. pic. twitter.   —   Michelle Fields (@MichelleFields) March 10, 2016,  —   The Washington Post reiterates Ben Terris’s account of events: I spoke briefly with Terris after the statement and both tweets had been posted, and he reiterated that he clearly witnessed Lewandowski grab Fields’s arm as she tried to question Trump on Tuesday  —   no doubt in his mind.  Politico publishes what it says is a transcript of audio of the event: Din of people talking, clanking of glasses, snippets of conversation, reporters telling one another to ‘move up a little’ greeting each other, saying ‘good to see you’ saying ‘OK good quote then’ then clearly action picks up as cameras start clicking. Fields: "Mr. Trump, you went after the late Scalia for affirmative action, do you  —   are you still against affirmative action?" Voice (allegedly Corey Lewandowski): "Excuse me, thank you. " A few moments later (noise of the room can be heard)  …     Terris: "You OK?" Fields: "Holy sh*t. " Terris: "Yea he just threw you down. " Fields: "I can’t believe he just did that that was so hard. Was that Corey?" Terris: "Yeah, like, what threat were you?" Fields: "That was insane. You should have felt how hard he grabbed me. That’s insane. I’ve never had anyone do that to me from a campaign. " Terris: "Can I put that in my story?" Fields: "Yeah, go for it  —   that was really awful. That’s so unprofessional. " Terris: "He really just almost threw you down on the ground. " Fields: "He literally went like this and was grabbing me down. I don’t even what to do [about] what he just did to me. Oh my God, that really spooked me that someone would do that. " Terris: "What threat were you?" Fields: "Nothing. I was asking about affirmative action. " Terris: "And he probably knows you, right?" Fields: "Yeah, I don’t understand. That looks horrible. You’re going after a Breitbart reporter, the people who are nicest to you?" Terris: "I know, I’m going to put it in my story. " The two stop talking.   of people talking, glasses clinking continue through end of the recording.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
