’   Exit polls rolled in on Tuesday evening and provided the   first glimpse into where the electorate stands on Election Day. ’ ’   National Fox News surveys of voters showed that Democratic   presidential nominee Hillary Clinton held an edge in voters   thinking she would be a good commander in chief, and Republican   nominee Donald Trump had an edge on the economy and being   able to bring change to the country. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tFox News exit poll: Clinton has edge on who would be better commander in chief, Trump has advantage on economy  ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tTrump winning big in this Fox exit poll category: Can candidate bring change? *Clinton: 13%*Trump: 82%  ’ "   MSNBC’s national exit polls showed Trump up among white with no   college degree and Clinton up with black and Latino voters,   although her margins with Latino voters in the exit polls   weren’t as high as President Barack Obama’s were in 2012: " ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tAmong white  :Women: Trump  %Men: Trump  %’t’t’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tEarly exit Black votersClinton 87%Trump 8%2012:Obama 93%Romney 6%’t’t’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tLatino voters    early exit:Clinton 65%Trump 27%2012:Obama 71%Romney 27%’t’t’ ’ showed that, contrary to polls throughout the   election cycle that showed both Trump and Clinton with     unfavorability ratings, only 25% of voters said their   vote was based on a dislike of other options. And only 31% said   they like their candidate but have reservations. ’ "   Still, only 40% of voters as of 5 p. m. said they were excited or   optimistic about Clinton or Trump’s tenure in the White House. " ’   Somewhat surprisingly, 62% of voters said they decided who to   vote for before September and only 12% said they decided who to   vote for over the past week. This is noteworthy considering the   recent scandals both have endured  —   Trump with leaked audio   showing him making lewd comments about women and Clinton with the   FBI reopening its investigation into her private email server. ’
