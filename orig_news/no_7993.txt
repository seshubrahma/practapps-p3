Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is responding to President Barack Obama, who while overseas said foreign leaders are rattled by Trump. ["When you rattle someone, that’s good because many of the world, many of the countries in our world  …    have been absolutely abusing us and taking advantage of us," Trump responded to Obama’s comment during a press conference in Bismarck, North Dakota. "If they’re rattled in a friendly way  …    that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. "  "He is a man who shouldn’t be really airing his difficulties and he shouldn’t be airing what he’s airing where he is right now," Trump added about the President. "He has not done a good job. " "President Obama, you see what’s happened  …    we’re a divided country  …    we’re going to solve those problems," the New Yorker vowed.
