Pop star Katy Perry used giant skeletons to skewer President Donald Trump and U. K. Prime Minister Theresa May during her performance Wednesday night at the 2017 Brit Awards. [Surrounded   by rows of miniature houses, Perry performed her "purposeful" pop song "Chained to the Rhythm. " She was soon singing and dancing alongside two giant skeletons, donning outfits similar to ones worn by Trump and May when the Conservative Party leader visited the White House last month.   Social media users were quick to post pictures of the singer‚Äôs onstage parodies of the two political leaders.

On Tuesday, the    singer released the music video for "Chained to the Rhythm. " The   video, filled with political symbolism, mourns a broken American dream and appears to critique Trump‚Äôs immigration policies. Watch Perry‚Äôs performance in the video above.
