Tuesday in an interview with USA Today’s Capital Download, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said   Donald Trump appointing Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus as his White House chief of staff and former Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon as his chief strategist is the "best single thing" Trump has done in the last three weeks.  When asked what the best and worse things Trump had done so far, Gingrich said, "I think the best single thing he did was bringing in Bannon and Priebus so that you have a very hard line conservative warrior as your chief strategist and you have a really sophisticated manager of the establishment as your chief of staff. I think the two of them combined  —   naming either one of them by themselves would have been a mistake  —   but the two of them combined gives him as good of a team as you’re going to get to try and in a sophisticated way synthesize what he is trying to get done. " He added, "I think the worst thing he did was the tweet the other night about illegal votes. I mean you know presidents of the United States can’t randomly tweet without having somebody check it out. It makes you wonder about whatever else he’s doing. It undermines much more than a single tweet. I’d say that probably the single biggest thing he has done wrong. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
