The three media moderators for the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were announced today by the Commission on Presidential Debates. [The first debate will by moderated by NBC’s Lester Holt, followed by a team effort by CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Martha Raddatz for the second townhall style debate.  Raddatz moderated the   debate between Paul Ryan and Joe Biden in 2012, despite reports that President Barack Obama had attended her wedding in 1991. "That had nothing to do with what I did at the debate. Nothing," Raddatz later insisted to Breitbart News reporter Matthew Boyle. Finally, Fox News anchor Chris Wallace will moderate the third presidential debate. Leftists will likely protest the addition of a Fox News anchor with the selection of Wallace, although he recently interviewed Hillary Clinton on his Fox News Sunday Show. The   debate will be moderated by Elaine Quijano of CBS.
