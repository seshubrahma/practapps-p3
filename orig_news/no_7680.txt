And yet (Is Trumpâ€™s favorite football player DeSean Jackson?)  â€¦     And Trumpâ€™s campaign forced to release this statement that will bigfoot his economic message and all of the negative headlines about Clinton: "Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign first raised this issue to smear   Barack Obama in her very nasty, failed 2008 campaign for President. This type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the Clinton Playbook. As usual, however, Hillary Clinton was too weak to get an answer. Even the MSNBC show Morning Joe admits that it was Clintonâ€™s henchmen who first raised this issue, not Donald J. Trump. In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised. Inarguably, Donald J. Trump is a closer. Having successfully obtained President Obamaâ€™s birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States. Mr. Trump is now totally focused on bringing jobs back to America, defeating radical Islamic terrorism, taking care of our veterans, introducing school choice opportunities and rebuilding and making our inner cities safe again.

Even when she is talking about this   issue, the audience does not seem that enthusiastic, at least now as much as they were for Obama. 8:57: Clinton again promises amnesty legislation within the first 100 days if she gets elected. She says it will "keep families together" and include a "path to citizenship" for illegals. 8:53: Clinton says during Hispanic heritage month, students will study Dolores Huerta and Julian and Joaquin Castro. She also mentions Laurie Hernandez and Roberto Clemente. She also speaks about   and those whose families have been here "before the United States even existed.

She desperately needs young minority voters who are not enthusiastic about her candidacy. She says weâ€™re at a "pivotal moment" in the nationâ€™s history for Latinos. She slams Trumpâ€™s "outlandish" and "offensive" comments. She says Obama is a tough act to follow in "more ways than one. " Clinton has now been at the CHCI gala venue for about 10 minutes.

He again says heâ€™s running to be the president of the United States of America and not the president of the world. He speaks about his plans to reduce poverty for   and Hispanic communities. He tells the Hispanic community that he will protect their jobs, build up their schools, and give them safety, which also means protecting them from radical Islamic terrorism. He says itâ€™s time to rebuild our inner cities before we allow refugees from all over the world from entering. 8:12: Trump says while Clinton slanders Americans as "deplorables," he calls them   American people who love their country and families. He is citing Bernie Sandersâ€™s comments about Clintonâ€™s "bad judgment" and slams her for not taking responsibility for the rise of ISIS. 8:06: In New Hampshire, Trump says he has some "good news. " He says the press is stuck on an airplane and will be about 30 minutes late. He says they asked if he could wait and he said he wouldnâ€™t. "Letâ€™s get going," Trump says. He cites his good poll numbers, which can decline just as quickly if decides to say random things that distract from his message, and says he was right about how companies like Ford are leaving the United States. Trump says his support comes from all regions and from all walks of life and heâ€™s running to be president of all Americans. 8:03: Obama denouncing the politics of "anger" and "vitriol" without mentioning Trump. He says some are talking about what the "real America looks like" and "it only includes a few of  us. " "Whoâ€™s going to decide what the real America is?" he asks.

She said having a few days to herself was actually a gift. She says the campaign trail doesnâ€™t encourage "reflection" and being at home helped her "reconnect" with what the campaign is about. She says when people like her are under the weather, she can take a few days off but millions of Americans cannot.

The more Clinton is in the news, the better Trumpâ€™s poll numbers get, as last week showed.

He says the big things re: neutrality is the amount of revenue his plan will generate and the companies that will not leave the country. Trump pivots to companies like Ford leaving the country because taxes are so high and suffocating regulations. He also talks about cutting budgetary costs. Trump also says we need to be compensated for defending countries like Saudi Arabia. He says, "Iâ€™m sure they will be thrilled to hear that. " Trump wonders if Saudi Arabia would even exist if we didnâ€™t defend the nation. 12:36: Trump now being interviewed after his speech. Trump talking about his 15% corporate tax rate and how much waste that needs to be cut. Trump talks about a "politically motivated" military that doesnâ€™t buy the generals the equipment that they want and need that probably costs less than some of the wasteful spending that is being done now. 12:35: Man comes out to clear prompters off stage.

"Hey heâ€™s a little late right?"  â€”   Ali Vitali (@alivitali) September 15, 2016,  12:31: Media "analysts" seem hysterical about Trumpâ€™s economic plan.

Trump speaking about "dynamic growth models" and says his economic plan is the most   plan in the history of the country. 12:17: Trump says many of the special interests funding Clintonâ€™s campaign favor terrible trade deals while the   "experts" advising her were in favor of disastrous deals like NAFTA.

" He says he will eliminate all needless and   regulations on the books, "and there are plenty of them. " He speaks of various environmental regulations that will shut down   plants. Trump reminds the audience that Clinton wants to shut down miners and steel workers and "weâ€™re not going to let it happen.

His plan, he says, will offer tax relief to   Americans along with his childcare plan. Trump says people earning $5 million, "like the people in this room," wonâ€™t see their taxes change that much and wonâ€™t get much of a break. Trump says under his plan, people making, for example, $5 million  â€”   like the people in this room  â€”   donâ€™t get a new income tax break (1)  â€”   Celeste Katz (@CelesteKatzNYC) September 15, 2016,  He promises an "explosion" of growth and vows that wealth that is parked overseas will also be brought back under his plan. "Weâ€™ll bring it back and it will only be taxed at the rate of 10% instead of 35%," he says. "Itâ€™s going to be something that will be so phenomenal  â€¦     far beyond what people even think. " Trump says his tax plan will favor the middle class that built this country "and we will not forget. "   11:58: Trump says the   people Clinton calls "deplorables" are the "most admirable people" he knows, including cops, teachers, blacks, whites, Latinos. He says, above all, they are Americans who love their families and country and want a better future. He says "these are the forgotten men and women"  of this country who donâ€™t have a voice. "Iâ€™m running to be their voice," he says. 11:56: Trump says only donors will prosper under Clinton because she doesnâ€™t have ideas that will create American jobs. He says the only thing Clintonâ€™s plan can offer "is a welfare check, thatâ€™s it. " 11:55: Trump says that instead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will be a great magnet for jobs. He says Clinton rejects this optimism and offers more taxes, regulation, and wealth redistribution that will lead to a future of slow growth, declining income, and dwindling opportunities. 11:54: Trump is now praising himself for being able to read from a TelePrompter "Who else could pull that off?"  â€”   Leigh Ann Caldwell (@LACaldwellDC) September 15, 2016,  [Bill Clinton gave part of his State of the Union address when the wrong speech was loaded in Teleprompter.

Another stupid    comment that only gives more ammunition to his opponents.] Trump re dealing with Teleprompter issues: "who else could have pulled that off?" Answer: Bill Clinton 1993 speech https:  .   â€”   Chris Donovan (@chrisdonovan) September 15, 2016,  11:53: Trump says everything that is broken today can be fixed. 11:52: Trump says his economic plan rejects the "cynicism" that says our labor force will keep declining and the pessimism that says our "standard of living can no longer rise. " Trump says todayâ€™s economy is one of "no growth and redistribution of wealth. And thatâ€™s not going to work. " 11:50: At the Economic Club in New York, Trump first cites his great poll numbers that have clearly put him in a great mood. Trump speaks to the "silent nation of jobless Americans" and says itâ€™s "disgraceful" that politicians allow companies like Ford get away with moving all of its production of small cars to Mexico.
