Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) More than 1, 300 lives are cut short each year in the Los Angeles area because of air pollution, scientists say. Now, after years of work, regulators are getting ready to adopt their most substantial plan in more than a decade to do something about it. The proposal is outlined in   pages from the South Coast Air Quality Management District, whose jurisdiction extends across Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Not surprisingly, it has set off debate, as critics have called the plan too lenient on industry. "California has made clear that it intends to be a leader on environmental issues," said Angela Johnson Meszaros, a staff attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group. "And here we’ve got the Los Angeles air agency not doing all that it can. " All sides recognize that industries under the agency’s regulatory power  —   including refineries, ports and warehouses  —   must adopt cleaner technologies. The agreement breaks down over how to get there. The draft blueprint would adopt some tougher emissions rules. But it also calls for a carrot approach: roughly $15 billion in handouts over the next 15 years to encourage polluters to clean up. Some community leaders have portrayed the incentives  —   which would surely involve tax increases  —   as a form of corporate welfare at the expense of   families. But supporters of the plan have argued that they are needed to avoid stifling business. Smaller operators, for example, may not be able to afford a new, cleaner truck. "Obviously you can’t make everybody happy," said Philip M. Fine, deputy executive officer for the air district. "But we think we’ve developed a sensible, comprehensive and regulatory approach. " At a public meeting last Friday, the air agency’s board was supposed to vote on a final version of the plan. Hundreds of people showed up, filling overflow rooms. Testimony included stories of the personal toll that asthma is taking on young Californians. Business leaders warned of job losses if the plan were amended to add new rules. In the end, the board postponed the vote, citing the unexpected absence of a member. They’ll try again next month.

Visitors are confined to a nearby trail. The upside is McWay Cove has remained an unspoiled slice of the California coast. Want to submit a photo for possible publication? You can do it here.
