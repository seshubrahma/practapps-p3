"We know what happens to football players who have had concussions, how they begin to lose some of their cognitive ability," he said, calling for Clinton to release her medical records. Scheiner pointed out that he also had questions about Clinton’s use of Coumadin to prevent blood clots. "I’d like to know how well she’s being controlled, that’s a difficult drug to use," he said. Scheiner retired in 2014, after 35 years of practicing medicine. During the interview, Scheiner recalled warmly his letter of fitness for Obama, when he was a candidate for president, describing him as a man who was youthful and built of "solid muscle. " He also ridiculed Trump’s letter from his doctor promoting him as "the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency" and suggested that the billionaire appeared overweight. Although Scheiner said he had "misgivings" about Clinton as president, he preferred her immensely to the idea of Trump as president. "He scares the devil out of me," he said.
