CAIRO (AP)  â€”   The lawyer of   charity worker Aya Hijazi says she has been released from prison after nearly three years of detention. [Taher Abol Nasr told The Associated Press she was released late Tuesday, two days after a court acquitted her of charges of child abuse that were widely dismissed as bogus by human rights groups and U. S. officials.  Hijazi and her husband had established a foundation to aid street children, but were arrested along with six others in 2014. It was not immediately clear whether her   were also released. U. S. President Donald Trump did not publicly mention the case when he met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   earlier this month, but a senior White House official had said ahead of the meeting that the case would be addressed.
