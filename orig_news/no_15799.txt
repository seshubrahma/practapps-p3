Comey describing a January 27    dinner with the President.    5. "I discussed with the FBI’s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure   Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true we did not have an open   case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. . .. I offered that assurance."    Comey on a January 6 meeting with Trump, explaining what he was told about any investigation into him personally.  6.
