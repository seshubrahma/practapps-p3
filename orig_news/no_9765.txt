On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s "AC360," CNN Political Commentator Angela Rye stated that "Donald Trump’s election, in my mind, is far from legitimate. "  Rye said, "Donald Trump’s election, in my mind, is far from legitimate, at this point. I have every issue with the world that the fact that Hillary Clinton gets closer and closer every day to three million vote  —   to a three million vote lead against Donald Trump. I have every issue in the world with the fact that electors feel like they can’t, in some instances, in good conscience, support this man as president. I have every issue in the world with the fact that the intelligence community is questioning the legacy of legitimacy of this election. If someone can hack into, not just our process  —  . " She added, "I do not believe this is legitimate, for a lot of reasons, including the fact that the intelligence community says that our electoral process was tampered with.   …     I have every issue with the Electoral College, and I have since before this election. It does not speak for me. I am not supporting a system that was built on the backs of my ancestors who were slaves. I’m not here for it.   …     That guy is not my president.
