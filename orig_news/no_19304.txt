’   Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump on Saturday of intentionally   deceiving voters about the FBI’s renewed investigation into her   use of a private email server. ’ ’   "Donald Trump is already making up lies about this," she said at   a rally in Daytona Beach, Florida. "He is doing his best to   confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people. " ’ ’   On Friday, FBI Director James Comey  that   new emails related to the agency’s investigation into Clinton had   been discovered. ’ ’ ’ "Here’s video of Clinton’s comments in Daytona Beach re: FBI revisiting email probe " ’   Trump  the FBI’s announcement   offered him hope that the law enforcement agency would finally   recommend charges be brought against her. The Republican   presidential nominee has previously alleged that Clinton   violated the law by deleting thousands of emails on a private   server she used to conduct official business as secretary of   state. ’ "   Clinton has denied any wrongdoing and said at Florida’s rally   that Comey’s announcement was perplexing.  " ’’ ’   "Well, if you’re like me, you probably have a few questions about   it. It is pretty strange  —   it’s pretty strange to put something   like that, with such little information, right before an   election," she said. ’ ’   Clinton added: "In fact, it’s not just strange, it’s   unprecedented. And it’s deeply troubling because voters deserve   to get full and complete facts. And so we have called on Director   Comey to explain everything right away. Put it all on the table. " ’ ’   It was unclear when the FBI would complete its review of the   newly found emails or if Comey would provide more information on   the new development before the November 8 election. ’
