In his   speech Saturday, Trump described in detail his electoral victory, providing a    recap of places most expected him to loose. He claimed his wife Melania’s late campaign speech in Pennsylvania helped turn the state in his favor. He told the   crowd he was planning an aggressive beginning to his administration, vowing to loosen regulations and end President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. "Regulations are coming off, we’re going to get rid of Obamacare," he said, also vowing again to construct a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Trump also provided more detail about his bid to reduce the costs of the new Air Force One.
