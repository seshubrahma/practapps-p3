’  ’ ’   "Ever heard of Uber or Lyft?" ’ "   The man on TV has   gray hair and looks directly into   the camera. Behind him, there’s a false backdrop of trading   screens and skyscrapers. It’s an ad running on CNBC and Fox News   for something called YayYo. " ’   "Yes, YayYo," the man says. The  isn’’t for its   app. It’’s for an . ’ ’   The man looks familiar, but his pitch is unusual. ’ ’   You could make millions, like the early investors in Uber, he   suggests. "Do it now. Before all the shares are gone." ’ ’   Watching these ads, two questions come to mind: ’ ’   The answer to both is yes. The actor’’s name is John O’’Hurley. How   it’’s possible that he’’s pitching shares in a risky startup on TV   is more complicated. Even though the IPO is "qualified" by the   Securities and Exchange Commission, the aggressive way YayYo   shares are being marketed could be problematic, experts say,   especially since the pitch is to    investors. ’ ’  ’ ’   The company is a tiny startup with no working product, few   staffers, but a big marketing budget. YayYo says it wants to be   the Kayak of the   industry, allowing you to compare   prices and book rides on Uber, Lyft, and other such companies in   a single app. ’ ’   At the center of it all is Ramy   whose life before   starting YayYo involved working with an arms dealer, promoting   "Men Are from Mars, Women Are From Venus," and led ultimately to   accusations of a   scheme and one of the   biggest securities bailouts in history. ’ ’     never admitted wrongdoing but was barred from running   a public company for five years, a steep comedown for a man who   once proudly rubbed shoulders with the likes of Hugh Hefner,   Ivanka Trump, and royalty as he sought to amass a fortune. ’ ’     is pitching investors on the YayYo IPO thanks to the   2012 Jumpstart our Business Startups, or JOBS . Meant to   spur investment in smaller companies, it also allowed companies   to pitch their IPOs on TV for the first time and created a new   kind of   whereby entrepreneurs can raise up to $50   million from just about anyone. ’ ’  ’ ’   "If you would  —   write this in a positive way,"   said in   the third of a series of interviews with Business Insider,   concerned about being portrayed negatively. He spoke with   reporters over the phone and in person at his Beverly Hills   office. ’ ’   In those conversations, Batrawi said YayYo has big plans. In   addition to its aggregator app, YayYo says it is gearing up to   launch its own    with a fleet of luxury cars   and salaried drivers behind the wheel. ’ ’   "We are moving along in pretty good shape," he said. ’ "   But while YayYo aggressively solicits investors on TV, the   company’s products are far from ready, and some of his claims   don’t seem to stand up. " "   Launching the aggregator service is dependent on securing   agreements with companies such as Uber and Lyft so that it can   integrate those services’ prices and available cars into the   YayYo app. " ’     said in one conversation that those deals were on the   way. YayYo is in "contact" with Uber and it has an "agreement"   with Lyft, he said. ’ ’   Uber and Lyft deny this. ’ ’   "We sent YayYo a    letter several weeks ago and   have suspended their access to Lyft," Adrian Durbin, a Lyft   spokesman, told Business Insider. "I think it’’s fair to say that   their CEO’’s characterization of our relationship is wildly   inaccurate." ’ ’   Uber has no deal of any kind with YayYo, according to Kaitlin   Durkosh, a spokeswoman for Uber. ’ ’   Later,   said the company never got Lyft’’s      order, and Bob Vanech, a YayYo board member,   said it has some "clever strategies" to deal with the fact that   Uber and Lyft are denying companies like YayYo access to their   information. YayYo plans to partner with   companies   "three through 100," he said. ’ ’   YayYo said it is planning a beta in the next couple of weeks. ’ ’   "We work 18 hours a day,"   said. "We know how close we   are. It may feel like vaporware for some people. But the moment   we start launching and generating revenue, which is not far   along, our valuation is so much lower than what you would   consider what Uber and Lyft is and everybody else." ’ ’   The IPO, with a share price of $8, already values the company at   $200 million. ’ ’   Which brings us to those TV ads with John O’’Hurley of "Seinfeld"   fame. ’ ’  ’ ’   "You might never have thought you’’d be able to have a chance to   invest in the new millennium movement of ridesharing," O’’Hurley   says   to prospective investors in YayYo’’s ad   announcing its IPO. ’ ’   The YayYo spot boils down to this pitch: You probably missed out   on investing in Uber and Lyft before they made investors   millionaires. But because of the new SEC rule, YayYo is your   chance for some   riches. ’ ’   "Because of YayYo’’s business model, YayYo can scale faster than   any one of these   companies can alone," the ad says.   Experts say the implication that YayYo could become bigger than   Uber is audacious enough to attract legal and regulatory   scrutiny. ’ ’   About 700 people have already invested,   says, with   individual investments ranging from a single $8 share purchase to   $100, 000. ’ ’     says repeatedly that the ads target only professional,   savvy investors who watch   channels like Fox   Business and CNBC during the day. ’ "   But those networks also attract many hobby investors and   retirees, and the ad’s own script specifically speaks to     investors. " ’   "With these new SEC rules, it makes it possible for the little   guy like you or me to buy into an IPO previously unavailable,"   O’’Hurley tells TV viewers. ’ ’   Those new SEC rules are something called "Regulation A+," which   was approved in March 2015 as part of the JOBS Act. ’ ’  ’ ’   Regulation A+ made it easier for   startups like YayYo   to essentially crowdsource investment in a " ." It’’s like   Kickstarter, except investors become real shareholders. ’ "   The idea was to open startup investing to Main Street, as long as   they don’t put in more than 10% of their income or assets. " ’   And as part of the rules, there are fewer requirements and   regulations for companies like YayYo than if it were to do a     IPO. ’ ’   There are actually two kinds of Regulation A+ offerings. In Tier   1, a company can raise up to $20 million from investors in a   year. Importantly, Tier 1 is regulated more by individual states   than the SEC. Tier 2 offerings, like YayYo, are larger  —   raising   up to $50 million in a year  —   and though both require an SEC   review, the latter offerings are not subject to review by the   states. ’ "   To the public, that these offerings are submitted to the SEC   might imply that it’s a pretty good bet. " ’   "That gives some comfort level to your average person," said Sam   Guzik, a   lawyer at Guzik & Associates.   "That this is something that has been qualified by the SEC. Most   people don’’t take the time to read the disclosure, and if they   do, they are not going to understand or appreciate it." ’ "   For those who do wade through YayYo’s SEC filings, which are   comprehensive, just how risky this investment is becomes clear   quickly. " "   The company’s products are still in development, and much of its   app is being developed by outside vendors under a licensing deal. " ’   Without agreements in place with companies like Uber and Lyft,   the filing says "the technical barrier to entry is steep." ’ "   YayYo has no history for investors to judge its prospects, and   its executives have no history working together, or running   similar companies. Its auditor says there’s substantial doubt   YayYo can continue as a going concern. At the end of October,   YayYo had only about $160, 000 cash on hand. " ’   "This is a company on the edge," Peter Henning, a former SEC   official and professor of law at Wayne State University, told   Business Insider. "It’’s very risky, which they say it is. Should   mom and pop be investing in this? You hope anyone investing in   this is putting money in they’’re willing to throw away." ’ ’  ’ ’   Some of those risk factors are typical of any     " " company. Others that have done Regulation A+ IPOs   include    which is working on an inexpensive   car, and      which designs robotic security systems. Either  fail, but both already have customers paying for their   products or placing deposits. ’ "   At this point, YayYo is mostly marketing.   paid rapper   Master P to write a    for the service, an ad that   showed Business Insider   during a visit to the company’s Beverly Hills offices. " "   But most of its marketing is targeting investors and those ads   don’t mention or allude to the risks. It’s up to prospective   investors to read through the dozens of pages of SEC filings to   see what they’re getting themselves into. " ’   "Most people have fallen asleep by page two," Henning said. The   SEC filing is "very intimidating." ’ "   And that’s what worries experts and some regulators. Do investors   really know what they’re buying, and do they know who they’re   doing business with? " ’  ’ ’   The life story of Ramy   according to Ramy     goes like this: ’ ’   Born in Switzerland, he wound up in Montreal where, at age 12,   after reading the   "Think and Grow Rich," he took   to heart its message of not procrastinating wealth and left home.   He hitchhiked his way to Tampa, Florida, because all the great   rich guys were in America,   says. ’ ’   He dropped out of high school, considering it another impediment   to riches, and was homeless for the first five Florida years,   partly living out of an old Cadillac, finding quarters on the   street, recapping tires, and doing odd jobs, but he "tried not to   work for anyone else." ’ ’   Somehow, by 23, he says, he made his first million with a     business. ’ ’   One day in the  ’’80s he was watching "Lifestyles of the Rich   and Famous." The subject  was   Adnan Khashoggi, the   arms dealer infamous for his   profligate spending and role in the   scandal. At the   time, Khashoggi was said to be the richest man in the world. ’ ’   "My goal is to be that,"   thought back then. "So when I   saw him, I just decided that’’s the guy I need to work with." ’ ’  ’ "   As   tells it, he sold everything and spent a year   searching for Khashoggi, tracking down his inner circle  —     including his psychic and chauffeur.   says he started   paying some of Khashoggi’s staff to tell him where he might find   the man himself. " ’   Finally,   said, after ingratiating himself, he landed   his first assignment from the billionaire: buying a       company called Jetborne. ’ ’   Thus began what   nostalgically calls "the Khashoggi   years," where he was the billionaire’’s No. 2 for nearly a decade,   "negotiating transactions everywhere," meeting heads of states,   sometimes holding multiple meetings in a single hotel lobby  —     "one in every corner"  —   he says. ’ "   The work he did with Khashoggi is also touted in his official bio   in YayYo’s . " ’   What was he selling then? "Different things. Russia needed   airplanes," he says. There was a pipeline deal. "Whatever you can   think of, we pretty much did." ’ "     was living the good life. Even today, his     accounts are full of pictures from past decades: playing poker   with Carl Icahn, standing next to former Los Angeles Clippers   owner Donald Sterling. In the ’90s, he met O’Hurley, who was   dating a flight attendant on one of the private planes that     owned back then. " ’  ’ "     said he was the one who introduced Donald Trump to   Khashoggi at Olympic Towers when they were all in New York in the   early ’90s. " ’   "It is interesting he became president,"   said. "I   would have never guessed that one." ’ "   Through all this, it’s not completely clear how   made   money. In court testimony from a case against Khashoggi,     says Khashoggi didn’t pay him a salary but rather   covered his travel expenses (at hotels, for instance) when they   were doing deals. " ’   Still,   had other ways to profit from his connection.   When someone once paid $100, 000 to introduce them to Khashoggi,   who would, in turn, introduce that person to some princes,     took a $25, 000 cut for making the connection, he   testified in a separate court case in 2012. ’ ’  ’ "   In the  ’90s   set off on his own. " ’   "I didn’’t want to always be Adnan’’s guy," he said. "I wanted to   be my own guy." ’ ’   Around this time,   had some marital problems and read   the book "Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus." It helped   him, and he started going to seminars held by its author, John   Gray. ’ ’   He went up to Gray after one of the sessions and persuaded Gray   to let him market the series, creating infomercials selling   videos and other products tied to the hit   book. ’ ’   "He was my first product,"   said of Gray. ’ ’   Gray calls   a master of infomercials. ’ ’   Sales soared, and the two became friends. Gray even became a   financial backer. ’ ’   "Anything he does I would invest in," Gray said in an interview   with Business Insider. "He’’s only brought me great success." ’ ’   Gray invested in the company that sprang from the infomercials,   GenesisIntermedia. ’ ’  ’ ’   The company branched out into other products like  and   says the company evolved into an   "incubator" that acquired and built companies to market and spin   off for a profit. ’ ’   One was a network of "internet kiosks" for shopping malls called   Centerlinq, and to market it, he turned, as he would time and   again, to his friend    most famous for his role as Elaine’’s eccentric boss on   "Seinfeld." ’ "   It was the   boom of the late ’90s, and   was   taking full part. In 1999, he took GenesisIntermedia public.     says Genesis was flying high. " ’   "I’’m hoping you write this one,"   says as he rattles   off stats about the company’’s   era. Revenues grew   "exponentially." The stock was up "about 1, 000 percent in two   years." ’ "   That was true until it wasn’t. Before long, the stock would be   worthless, but Gray didn’t lose faith in  . " ’   "He’’s responsible. He’’s friendly, tremendous integrity," Gray   says of  . Gray said he’’s also invested in YayYo. ’ ’   The SEC had a different view. ’ ’  ’ ’   In 2006, about four years after the company collapsed, the      along with Khashoggi and others, with   manipulating GenesisIntermedia stock. ’ ’   The SEC alleged that GenesisIntermedia lent its stock to brokers   in exchange for cash and then engaged in a number of actions to   prop up the stock’’s price. That included making thousands of   trades "to create the false appearance of widespread investor   interest," and hiring Courtney Smith, a bullish financial   commentator who would appear on Bloomberg TV and CNBC. ’ ’   Profits were funneled to Khashoggi through a Bermuda company   called Ultimate Holdings, which then lent the shares to others,   who were left holding the bag when the stock price tumbled from   $25 a share to pennies. ’ "   In the government’s charges, the actions resulted in $130 million   in illegal profits and the largest bailout in the history of the   Securities Investor Protection Corp. wiping out several   middlemen brokerages, like  in Minnesota. " ’     said in a 2009 deposition that he was "trying to make   [Khashoggi] money to prove that I was kind of  —   he was like my   mentor  —   and I really looked up to him." ’ ’   The case was    in 2010. The SEC barred   and Khashoggi from running   public companies for five years. Neither admitted nor denied   wrongdoing. ’ "   Courtney Smith, the TV commentator, was acquitted of charges   against him. He’s now a consultant for YayYo. " ’     dismisses the charges he faced, and he has long blamed   an FBI agent and stock manipulator for dooming his company. ’ ’   "  hit,"   said. "Arabs were a good target for people   at the time, the SEC and all of that. They filed the lawsuit   after five years before the statute of limitations ran out   because they couldn’’t find anything wrong. And after battling for   seven years we just ended up with a consent decree . .. It wasn’’t   fraud then, it isn’’t fraud now   …     At the end, they found the   people were who shorting the stocks were hired FBI agents." ’ ’   More recently, in an unrelated 2014 case, investors sued     alleging that he misled them about an investment in a     company that   controlled called   Xerveo, which sold diet products. The case was later settled,   California court documents show. ’ ’  ’ ’   You won’’t find YayYo’’s name in the visitor’’s directory at 9665   Wilshire Blvd. in Beverly Hills, but if you head down a drab   hallway on the eighth floor, you’’ll see a sign that says "YAY   YO." ’ "   Walk right in (no one answers the door) and you’ll find four   people sitting around a long table. " ’   At center is   surrounded by a programmer, a      guy, and a   coordinator. ’ ’   In a room across the hall, women wearing headsets answer calls   from prospective investors. ’ ’   YayYo looks like a lot of startups do. Staffers wear   and   jeans. Plans are scribbled across whiteboards. ’ "   An ad for the YayYo IPO has just aired on TV, and     pulls up the website’s analytics. The number starts soaring: 177,   290, and then over 500 people on the site all at once. " ’   "As soon as [O’’Hurley] finishes talking, then it really   accelerates,"   says. "It’’ll keep going higher." ’ ’   If you’’re wondering,   said he didn’’t know that "yayo"   is sometimes . He wanted a catchy name, "like Google," but also   one that’’s easily pronounced in Chinese, where he wants to   expand. ’ ’   "We have 100 times more positive comments on it than negative   comments. It’’s very memorable." ’ "   But it’s what O’Hurley says in the ad that could get YayYo into   trouble. " ’   "There are really only two rules," Sara Hanks, a former SEC   official, CEO and founder of CrowdCheck, told Business Insider.   "Don’’t lie, and don’’t say anything that is misleading in any   way." ’ ’  ’ ’   But what’’s "misleading" is somewhat subjective. ’ ’   "You know it when you see it," Hanks said. ’ "   Legal experts had varying views of where the line is, but   identified specifics in YayYo’s ad they would generally advise   clients avoid: " "   Vanech, the board member, said the ad was approved by lawyers,   and then filed with the SEC, which contacted YayYo’s attorneys   and requested changes to the visual background behind O’Hurley,   which had imagery that looked too much like the New York Stock   Exchange and the SEC logo. He said regulators did not object to   the script. The SEC declined to comment. " "   Most companies go public when they’ve already proved something,   like sales or a promising drug in development. " ’   "YayYo’’s advantage is that they have a substantial marketing   budget," Darren Marble  —   CEO of CrowdfundX, which does marketing   for companies doing Regulation A+ IPOs  —   told Business Insider.   Based on the number of times the ad has played, YayYo’’s ad   spending is likely hundreds of thousands of dollars. ’ ’  ’ ’   The ad has run at least 33 times nationally since it debuted on   April 19, which cost the company at least $111, 000, according to   analytics company  which tracks only national airings. The ad has likely   run far more times on DirecTV, which reaches a sizable portion of   the population. ’ "     like YayYo’s are still novel. To some, they already   have a stigma: Why can’t the company raise traditional venture   capital, they wonder. But proponents say a successful Regulation   A+ can raise millions of dollars without founders having to give   up control to outside investors. " ’   But if these early years of Regulation A+ are marked by failures,   it could cast a permanent pall over these kinds of offerings. ’ ’   "Regular investors are the ones that can fall for a scam,"   Henning of Wayne State University said. ’ "   When lawmakers were debating the JOBS Act, some state regulators   objected, saying it could put small investors at risk. Two states   sued because the JOBS act reduces states’ ability to police   deals. " ’   If YayYo had decided to do an offering   Act, it would   have come under state regulators’’ control. A few states assess   the "merit" of   and some may have objected to YayYo’’s   ads. ’ ’   "Generally speaking, as a state regulator, when we have the   authority to review, we will object to ads when a startup or   smaller company compares itself to a larger,     company," said Faith Anderson, chief of registration and   regulatory affairs for the securities division of the Washington   State Department of Financial Institutions. ’ ’  ’ "   Some states, such as Massachusetts, may have denied the entire   YayYo offering because the company has no track record, no   independent directors, or because of  ’s history with   the SEC. " "   But in larger filings, like YayYo’s, it’s only the SEC, not the   states, in control. " "    ’s past SEC action must be disclosed  —   it’s in the   filing  —   but it won’t stop him from offering the IPO, because it   occurred before the JOBS Act was passed. " "   All this is slowing Regulation A+’s rise into the mainstream. " ’   "I don’’t believe that the regulation is inherently flawed; I   think that it will take some time before we see quality companies   using it," said Cass Sanford, a lawyer at Sichenzia Ross Ference   Kesner LLP. ’ "   Past performance is no indication of future results.  ’s   colorful past doesn’t mean YayYo isn’t real. It’s no doubt a   highly risky investment, but its executives say they are true   believers. " ’   "That is our intention here: to build a great company," Vanech   said. ’ "   Yet there are other questions.   says he’s also a 10%   investor in a mysterious biotech startup called NeurMedix that   plans its own Regulation A+  complete with   O’Hurley on the offering page. " "     also owns an   company called  which is planning a     soon. The details of that company are vague, but   O’Hurley makes an appearance there too. " ’   And while   may have cleaned up his act,     records show he owns a number of websites promoting the three   IPOs and featuring articles about himself as an "  ."     wouldn’’t comment. Records show he also    fuckyouall. net. ’ ’   "We are doing everything we can to comply with all laws, to   follow the SEC guidelines, to use best practices, to give   individual investors the chance to get in at the ground floor,"   Vanech said in the final interview. He said this level of   "journalistic scrutiny at this stage of the business" is   unwarranted. ’ "   And to Ramy   his past and YayYo’s prospects are all   fully disclosed to investors. " ’   "There are a lot of risks in this. But there is a lot of upside   if we do execute. This is what people are betting on," he said.   "It really is up to the public to decide if this is for them or   not." ’ ’ Additional reporting by Frank Chaparro, Rebecca Harrington,   and Lydia Ramsey. ’ ’YayYo is a startup that plans to be an. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
