Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: •  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was fatally shot while giving a speech in Ankara, an attack a Russian official characterized as a terror attack. The gunman, described by Turkish officials as a      police officer, shouted "don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria! ," as captured in this video (warning, graphic images). Russia has long backed Syria’s government in that country’s brutal civil war. _____ • Hours earlier, the United Nations passed a resolution to monitor the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians from the fallen city of Aleppo. Russia signed on only after a compromise that could allow Syrian soldiers and allied Shiite militias to block the monitors’ access.

In Iraq, where the urban war against the Islamic State is grinding on, up to one million people are trapped in the city of Mosul, running low on food and water. _____ • The International Monetary Fund endorsed its leader, Christine Lagarde, despite her conviction in a French court on charges of misusing public funds.

Trump, the first American leader to speak to you in 37 years. Above, President Tsai   during the call. "When you are small and fighting a much bigger adversary," a Taiwanese diplomat told The Times a few months ago, "you had better use your wisdom. " China considers the island, ruled by Nationalists who fled the Communist takeover in 1949, a renegade province. So when the U. S. and China opened diplomatic relations in 1979, the U. S. had to cut off Taiwan. As China’s might and markets grew, most other countries followed suit. Taiwan is now recognized by just 22 countries, mostly tiny island nations in the Caribbean and Pacific swayed by Taipei’s aid packages. Two years ago, a former Guatemalan leader admitted to accepting Taiwanese bribes for diplomatic recognition. Taiwan’s last ally in Europe is the Vatican. But there, too, officials have made overtures toward China, which has a vigorous, if partly underground, Catholic community. For now, Nicaragua remains with Taiwan.
