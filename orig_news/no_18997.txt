’  ’ ’   PHILADELPHIA —  At first glance, the closing session of the   Democratic National Convention looked a lot like a Republican   National Convention. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’     But that first glance is misleading. Look at Thursday’s events     again and you’ll see the qualities that made the convention a     distinctly Democratic affair.   ’ ’     In this celebration of American strength and greatness, the     faces were overwhelmingly black and brown. The father     representing his son to the world and rebuking Donald Trump’s     attacks? A Muslim American immigrant.   ’ ’     The Medal of Honor winner speaking for veterans who might lose     out in a Trump administration? Another immigrant. The parents     honoring their son, a police officer who died on duty in     Cleveland? They were black.   ’ ’     From Monday to Thursday, each night of the Democratic National     Convention was marked by incredible diversity, represented by a     wide array of colors and creeds.   ’ ’     They weren’t just voices of normalcy —  people who represent the     extent to which  where normal includes nonwhites, unauthorized     immigrants, and the LGBTQ community. They were also voices     for optimism.   ’ ’     It was the startling fact of this entire convention. On Monday     alone there was Michelle Obama and her forceful defense of     America’s "greatness" and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker’s attempt     to raise his profile with a soaring national speech.   ’ ’     All week long, if you craved a message of optimism, your best     bet was a brown or black face. But that makes sense. Despite     deep problems of discrimination and racial inequality, it’s     nonwhites —  blacks, Hispanics, and other groups —  who have the most     optimistic view of the United States and its future.   ’ ’  ’ ’     For them, the country is closer than not to its       as a city on the hill, and for good reason. If you’re black, if     you’re Latino, if you’re gay —  life is unquestionably better now     than it was in the past.   ’ ’       In the hands and mouths of underrepresented groups, these       symbols of patriotism and national pride took on new meaning.       This wasn’t a crude jingoism. It was an expression of       pluralistic nationalism and deep civic pride, a progressive       patriotism that acknowledges the nation’s failures but       strives to overcome them.     ’ ’       What is remarkable is the extent to which this kind of       patriotism —  and much of the mood surrounding the convention —  is       rooted in black traditions of political       and religious rhetoric. In ways small and large, the       lifeblood of the Democratic National Convention was the black       church.     ’ ’       You saw this, in a literal way, with the stream of black       politicians and black religious leaders who took the stage.       The Rev. William Barber, the North Carolina preacher and head       of his state’s NAACP who founded the "Moral Mondays"       movement, gave a speech that was emblematic of the language       on display, a language and cadence drawn from the traditions       of the black church.     ’ ’  ’ ’       "Now, my friends, they tell me that when the heart is in       danger, somebody has to call an emergency code, and somebody       with a good heart will bring a defibrillator to work on the       bad heart," said Barber in his thundering address.     ’ ’       "[W]e are being called like our foremothers and fathers to be       the moral defibrillators of our time. We must shock this       nation with the power of love. We must shock this nation with       the power of mercy. We must shock this nation and fight for       justice for all. "     ’ ’       Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver kept up this theme of defiant       optimism in his peroration on Thursday. "They threw her down       as the first lady, but she didn’t stay throwed!" he bellowed,       referring to Hillary Clinton. "They threw her down as a U. S.       senator, but she wouldn’t stay throwed!     ’ ’       They threw her down as a secretary of state, but she wouldn’t       stay throwed! They threw her down in this very campaign —  this       campaign —  but she won’t stay throwed! No, she ain’t gonna stay       throwed! She won’t stay throwed! She won’t stay throwed!"     ’ ’       It has become commonplace to say that the Democrats presented       an uplifting view of the United States to contrast with the       darkness of the last week’s Republican National Convention.       It is tempting, even, to invoke Ronald Reagan’s "Morning in       America," especially since Clinton used the phrase in her       speech.     ’ ’       But pay attention to the tenor of this optimism, to the       rhythms of its expression. It isn’t the   of       Reagan, champion of the status quo. It is   hope, an       optimism born of struggle. It’s the "Mothers of the       Movement," whose grief fuels hopeful activism.     ’ ’       "We’re going to keep telling our children’s stories and       urging you to say their names," said Lucia McBath, mother of       Jordan Davis, who was slain in 2012.     ’ ’       "We’re going to keep building a future where police officers       and communities of color work together in mutual respect to       keep children, like Jordan, safe. " It’s the difference       between Reagan’s eternal lights "in this springtime of hope"       and Maya Angelou’s "still I rise," one of the refrains of       this week.     ’ ’  ’ ’       This progressive patriotism wasn’t just a cudgel to use on       Donald Trump, whose solipsism and fearmongering have exposed       him to a .     ’ ’       It was part of the bedrock of the argument against Trump and       Trumpism —  that he and his cause were fundamentally         that electing him would deal an irreparable blow       to the bonds of multicultural democracy.     ’ ’       And so we have Monday’s speech from Michelle Obama, which       stands as a paean to that conception of democracy.     ’ ’       We have Wednesday’s speech from Barack Obama, in which the       president made a vigorous defense of American pluralism.       "Fair to say, this is not your typical election. It’s not       just a choice between parties or policies, the usual debates       between left and right," said Obama, emphasizing the extent       to which he views Trump as a threat to America’s democratic       traditions.     ’ ’       "This is a more fundamental choice —  about who we are as a       people and whether we stay true to this great American       experiment in  . "     ’ ’       And we had Hillary Clinton’s acceptance speech, which       continued this theme of pluralism and patriotism and       reinforced the idea that this election, more than anything,       was a fight for democracy.     ’ ’       "Remember: Our founders fought a revolution and wrote a       Constitution so America would never be a nation where one       person had all the power," Clinton said. "Two hundred and       forty years later, we still put our faith in each other. "     ’ ’       The Thursday session of the Democratic National Convention       opened with a procession and color guard from Civil War         who arrived on stage in full regalia.     ’ ’       These weren’t any  . They were   of the       United States Colored Troops, the regiments of free and newly       freed blacks who fought for their freedom in the Civil War.     ’ ’       Their courage and valor was one of the catalysts for the       13Amendment to the Constitution, which       abolished slavery.     ’ ’       Those   represented those Americans who took action       to prove their citizenship —  to prove their bona fides as       Americans. And in turn, the effort to pay them their due       inaugurated America’s great experiment in multiracial       democracy, which has ebbed and flowed with the tides of       history and circumstance.     ’ ’       It was in that display that you saw the broader mood and       message of this week, one that harks back to the moment just       before the War of the Rebellion, when the nation was on the       brink of crisis. "Those bonds of affection; that common       creed," President Obama said, and I thought of Abraham       Lincoln’s first inaugural, an argument for union and in       defense of republicanism.     ’ ’       "We are not enemies, but friends," Lincoln said. "We must not       be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not       break our bonds of affection.     ’ ’       The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every       battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and       hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the       chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will       be, by the better angels of our nature. "     ’ ’       The Democratic Party believes that Donald Trump is a unique       threat to American democracy —  a threat to our experiment in       representative government. At its essence, this convention is       their first inaugural, their message to a country on the eve       of a   election.     ’ ’       "This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people       who inhabit it," said Lincoln in his address. Grounding       themselves in an optimism born of struggle, Democrats are       asking those people to continue the struggle for equality,       the fight to make a "more perfect union. "     ’ ’       To turn back Trump and assert the dignity of all Americans,       hopeful that with hard work, the problems of today will give       way to better prospects and a better future.     ’
