"Tonight’s comments were more than another example of Clinton lying to the country about her emails, jeopardizing our national security, or even calling citizens ‘ ’  —   this was Clinton, as a defender of Washington’s rigged system  —   telling the American public that she could care less about them," he said. He said it was "truly deplorable" that Clinton signaled contempt for Trump voters in front of her wealthy donors. "Clinton revealed just how little she thinks of the   men and women of America," he concluded.
