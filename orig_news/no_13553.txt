" (In their defense, she ran a lousy campaign and spent most of it hiding from tough questions, so her sloganeering was easy to miss. )[To paraphrase Tom Wolfe, the media tells us fascist violence is always descending on the Right, but somehow it always lands on the Left. Here are the top 10 acts of violence perpetrated against Trump supporters, by shock troops for the political ideology that claims it has a monopoly on tolerance and brotherly love.   By the way, most of these attacks were captured live on video,   confirmed by police reports. In each case, the attackers made it clear their actions were politically motivated. New York City subway thugs make strangulation great again:    Corey Cataldo dared to wear his "Make America Great Again" hat onto a Bronx subway train, and says he was choked and shoved for his action.

The next thing I know, I have hands around my neck, and I’m being choked. " A second man seemingly stepped in to help, but it turned out he just wanted to take a turn roughing him up, according to Cataldo. He said no one on the train actually did anything to help him.

He has also said one of the assailants singled him out by race, saying "that’s one of those white boy Trump supporters.
