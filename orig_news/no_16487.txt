Washington (CNN) Donald Trump’s campaign has unveiled new additions to its merchandise range, with the latest line of products including "  "   and "Hillary for Prison" buttons. Some of the new apparel and novelty items available from the Trump campaign’s online store incorporate opponent Hillary Clinton’s official campaign logo    a letter "H" and an arrow    in slogans such as "Guilty as Hill," "Hill No 2016" and "DisHonest." The collection also plays with Clinton’s signature pantsuit look with shirts emblazoned with the words "Liar, Liar, Pantsuit on Fire!" and a striped suit meant to look like prison garb along with the words "Crooked Hillary." The merchandise follows chants made at recent Trump events to "Lock her up!" over Clinton’s use of a private email server at the State Department. All of the new merchandise has been "proudly made in the USA," according to Trump’s website. Trump has been criticized in the past for outsourcing his own company’s manufacturing jobs to businesses overseas. The campaign relied heavily on merchandise as part of its paid advertising strategy during the primaries before it started rolling out its first general election television ads on Tuesday. It spent $208, 000 on its "Make America Great Again" hats in June in comparison to $120, 000 on online and print ads in the same month. Other members of the Trump family have also used the campaign spotlight to push different products, with his   daughter Ivanka marketing the outfit she wore to the Republic convention on Twitter the day after she addressed a   television audience in Cleveland.
