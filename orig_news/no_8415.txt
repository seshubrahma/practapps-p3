Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski joined guest host Matthew Boyle on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Channel 125 and slammed likely Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton as a flawed candidate saying, "Even her base doesn’t want her. "[Lewandowski talked about the "massive disconnect in the Democratic Party," and predicted that "she’s probably going to win the state of New Jersey," however, "Bernie Sanders is going to win California. That has to be a real   call. "  Lewandowski said Trump is putting states into play where Hillary Clinton was supposed to take control, citing the record number of primary votes and large turnouts at Trump’s campaign rallies. "They are trying to steal this election from Bernie," Lewandowski said, referencing the Democratic Party. Lewandowski disclosed that Trump spent roughly $50 million of his own money. He added that Trump has operated with a sliver of staff compared to Clinton. "The Trump campaign [has] 70  …    we have  " the staff that Clinton has, but "we get better results. " Breitbart News Saturday airs from 10 a. m. to 1 p. m. every Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125.
