Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is fundraising off of Donald Trump’s assertion that she was simply playing the "woman card" to win the presidency. ["Well, if fighting for women’s healthcare and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then Deal. Me. In," she said during her victory rally in Pennsylvania.  Now her campaign is fundraising off her remark, selling pink plastic cards that look like credit cards with a woman on them. Hillary Clinton’s Woman Card,  "Donate to get your official woman card," the website reads. It is unclear how the owner can "deal me in" with a deck of these cards.
