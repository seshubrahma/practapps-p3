Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) used former President Jimmy Carter’s words to bash Donald Trump in a new ad. [Cruz’s new ad uses a clip of former President Jimmy Carter telling the British Parliament that he would rather have Trump as president than Cruz.   "Trump has proven already that he’s completely malleable," Carter says. "I don’t think he has any fixed opinions that he would really go to the White House and fight for. " The ad then touts Carter’s assessment of Cruz. "Ted Cruz is not malleable," Carter says. "He has far   policies, in my opinion, that would be pursued aggressively if and when he would become president. "
