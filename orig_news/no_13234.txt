Sunday at a campaign rally in Rochester, NY, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump reacted to The Boston Globe running a dummy front page imagining what the news in the United States would be like if Trump were elected president.  Trump said, "How about that stupid Boston Globe? It’s worthless. Sold for a dollar. Did you see that story? The whole front page  —   they made up a story that Trump  —   they pretended Trump as the president. And they made up —  the whole front page is a make believe story, which is really, no different from the whole paper for the whole thing. I mean the whole thing is no different.
