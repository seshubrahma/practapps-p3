Let’s take Senator Tom Daschle and Senator Trent Lott  —   who spent their entire lives in Congress. They are now rich men. I could go on and on. The American people are tired of their public servants coming to Washington penniless, and leave office and become multimillionaires. It isn’t just wrong. It’s offensive. That’s what’s bugging the American people. That’s why so many of the people are angry. Because our government isn’t working for us. We’re working for our government. And so I ask  —   Hillary  —   you and your husband have earned $230 million in the past 15 years. What did you risk? What did you build? How many jobs did you create?"
