GOP frontrunner Donald Trump came up with a new slogan for his presidential campaign during a campaign rally in Indiana on Thursday. ["We have a movement going on. You know, in a way I call it the smart movement," Trump stated during his rally in Evansville, Indiana.  "We want to be smart again. We’re not smart anymore, folks," Trump told the audience. "We don’t win anymore, but we’re not smart anymore. So we call it ‘the smart movement,’ and that’s what I want to have. " Indiana voters head to the polls for the GOP primary on Tuesday.
