Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • The focus is on Mexico as the ramifications of President Trump’s new immigration orders begin to play out on border security and trade.

Down in New Orleans, the annual party leading up to Mardi Gras will be in full swing over the coming days, culminating next week on Fat Tuesday. One of the highlights is the parades by social clubs known as krewes. Riding on lavishly decorated floats, krewe members toss beads, plastic cups, coins and other "throws" to revelers lining a route that usually runs for several miles. Tonight’s parades include the Krewe of Muses, an   organization named after the goddesses of arts and sciences in Greek mythology. (Nine of New Orleans’s streets  —   including Calliope, Melpomene and Terpsichore  —   were also inspired by the daughters of Zeus.) Muses is one of the city’s newer krewes, parading for the first time in 2001. (Rex, one of the oldest, was founded in 1872.) Like many krewes, Muses is involved in charitable efforts in the community, but it is particularly known for the ornate shoes it throws  —   or gently hands  —   to the crowds. Its floats, including one resembling a giant   shoe, often have a satirical theme, and unlike other krewes, it does not have a king or queen. Instead, the group has an Honorary Muse. This year, it’s the journalist Tamron Hall. Chris Stanford contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.  What would you like to see here?
