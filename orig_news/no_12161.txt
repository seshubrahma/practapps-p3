Donald Trump ridiculed Hillary Clinton with an ad comparing the Democrat’s habit of deleting emails to a game of Ms. Pacman.[  "Crooked Hillary is a lot like Ms. " said Trump. "She’ll keep going and going and going until she’s cornered and caught! ‪#‎MakeAmericaGreatAgain‬. " The game features FBI ghosts, email Pacdots, and, of course, the head of Hillary herself as the ravenous Ms. Pacman. One peculiar difference between the original game and Trump’s rendition is the speed at which   can accumulate points, or emails deleted. Whereas Ms. Pacman would be lucky to gain 5, 000 points after an entire level,   amasses an impressive 30, 000 emails deleted in a little over ten seconds.  This ad debuted just a few weeks after Trump released a Hillary Pokémon Go parody, describing the Democratic nominee’s type as "career politician" and her next evolution as "unemployed. " The two ads reflect Trump’s edgy, mischievous pursuit of the millennial vote.  As for the Ms. Pacman parody, Breitbart Tech craves a DLC package featuring Hillary’s signature Ninja Squirrel hot sauce in place of the wandering fruits, as well as the cheat code "DNCandWallStreetBacking.
