President Barack Obama bitterly denounced presumptive nominee Donald Trump for his repeated challenges to his presidency for not taking the threat of radical Islamic terrorism seriously. [Obama appeared to have reached the breaking point, after repeated taunts from Trump reminding his followers that Obama refused to use the term "radical Islamic terrorism. "  "There’s no magic to the phrase ‘radical Islam,’" Obama said heatedly. "It’s a political talking point. It’s not a strategy. " Obama argued that he understood the threat posed by extremists, whom he asserted "perverted Islam" to justify terrorism. "Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away," Obama said. "This is a political distraction. " He described some of the attacks as "yapping" and denounced "politicians who Tweet and appear on cable news shows. Obama defended his decision not to use the phrase, insisting that it was not a result of political correctness but argued that it would help legitimize the enemy. He implied that using the phrase would do "the terrorists’ work for them" by suggesting that the fight was a war between the Islam religion and the United States and the Western world. "So someone seriously thinks that we don’t know who we’re fighting?" Obama asked mockingly. He cited some of the names of terrorists that had been killed during his administration, assuring the country that ISIS was on "defense. " "If there’s anyone out there who thinks we’re confused about who our enemies are, that would come as a surprise to the thousands of terrorists who we’ve taken off the battlefield," he boasted. He asserted, however, that radicalized Muslim terrorists were not "religious warriors" but "thugs. "
