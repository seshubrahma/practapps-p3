Insurgent Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has opened up a   lead over Hillary Clinton in the state of New Hampshire, which will hold the nation’s first primary contest on February 9.

Only 13 percent of likely Democratic voters in the poll said that foreign policy and national security were atop their priorities, in terms of issues in the race. The poll was conducted between January 13 and January 18 and has a margin of error of 4. 8 percent, a much smaller margin than Sanders’ lead.

"Not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence," he said. As Breitbart News has reported, Clinton’s    helped his buddy at Goldman Sachs get a   sent to Clinton at the State Department on behalf of a Goldman client.
