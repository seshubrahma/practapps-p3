From Kenneth P.

" According to interviews with more than a dozen people on or close to the campaign, staffers are increasingly dividing themselves into competing factions aligned with Trump’s three top officials  —   embattled campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who still commands deep loyalty among many of the people he hired deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner, who has a growing group of supporters and newly hired strategist Paul Manafort, who was elevated this week and is building his own fiefdom. Trump’s expansion of Manafort’s portfolio to include a wide swath of campaign strategy, coupled with other related moves, were intended partly to address organizational deficiencies in a campaign run for months by Lewandowski  —   one that underestimated rival Ted Cruz’s ability to compete and failed to prepare for the delegate battle that will decide a contested GOP convention. Multiple sources tell POLITICO that Trump increasingly came to realize the limitations of his team during the   to last week’s loss in the Wisconsin primary. That stretch coincided with his daughter Ivanka Trump having a baby, which limited her availability as a trusted adviser to her father.
