The Clinton campaign says Donald Trump is lashing out like a wounded animal, after he described former president Bill Clinton as a rapist. ["Trump is doing what he does best, attacking when he feels wounded and dragging the American people through the mud for his own gain," said Clinton campaign press secretary Nick Merrill. "If that’s the kind of campaign he wants to run that’s his choice. "  Trump revisited Bill Clinton’s lewd escapades in an interview with Sean Hannity, pointing out that the former president had been terrible to women. "In one case, it’s about exposure. In another case, it’s about groping and fondling and touching against a woman’s will," Hannity said during the interview referring to Bill Clinton. "And rape," Trump added. The Clinton campaign accused Trump of reacting poorly to news stories about his taxes, trying to change the subject. "So while he licks his wounds, we’ll continue to focus on improving the lives of the American people," concluded Merrill.
