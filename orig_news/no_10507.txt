During an interview broadcast on Wednesday’s edition of NBC’s "Today Show," Democratic vice presidential candidate Senator Tim Kaine ( ) responded to a question on untrue statements made by his running mate, Hillary Clinton, about her emails by saying, "if you ask somebody a question 150 times or 200 times, you’re going to be able to find that they don’t use exactly the same word every time, and there’s going to be variations, and then people are going to play on those. "  Kaine was asked by host Savannah Guthrie, "If you look at what she said over the past year or so about her email, I can count at least four statements that just turned out not to be true. Has she earned that mistrust?" He answered, "Savannah, if you ask somebody a question 150 times or 200 times, you’re going to be able to find that they don’t use exactly the same word every time, and there’s going to be variations, and then people are going to play on those. But  —  . " Guthrie interjected, "[S]he did use the same verbiage, it just happens to not be true. " Kaine then stated, "Well, here’s what I’ve heard her say. I’ve heard her say, I made a mistake, and I’ve learned something from it, and I wouldn’t do it again, and I apologize. " Guthrie then said, "She has acknowledged mistakes with respect to the email practices. She hasn’t acknowledged a mistake with regard to what she has told the American people. " Kaine responded, "The bottom line is this, you know, this is an area where she says, I made a mistake, and I’ve learned from it, and I’ve improved, and I’m going to do differently. When has Donald Trump during the course of this campaign, or his life, said, I’ve made a mistake, and I’m better, and I’m going to learn from it and grow from it?
