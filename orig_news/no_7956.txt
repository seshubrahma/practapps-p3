Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2016,  11:59: Ted Cruz on potential Trump nomination: Ted Cruz to @CNN when asked if he’ll support Trump if he wins nomination: "I will support the Republican nominee. Period. The end."  —   Chris Moody (@moody) March 2, 2016,  11:49: Tavis Smiley: Hillary Shouldn’t Take Black Voters for Granted Against Trump, Something tells me that if Donald Trump is indeed the Republican nominee, it might be a miscalculation for Democrats to assume that black voters are a lock for their nominee, even with the first black president and Barack Obama both campaigning for her. [Tony Lee: Van Jones, Jamelle Bouie and others have said that black voters may be receptive to Trump’s message. So there’s something there. It’s amusing that the same media and GOP establishment pundits who said Trump could not win the GOP nomination because he initially had such unfavorable poll numbers with Republican voters are now saying that he will lose minority voters by a landslide in a  potential general election. Not so fast. First, minority voters may not want to publicly admit that they support Trump because they fear a backlash against them, stirred by "leaders" and "activists" who often care more about their bottom lines and standing in the political circles than the interests of their communities. Second, though Clinton connects better with minority voters than Sanders, that’s not really saying much. Just compare Obama’s Brown Chapel AME address in 2007 with Hillary Clinton’s at a Selma church on the same day. Or compare Obama’s "fierce urgency of now" speech at Iowa’s   dinner with whatever   speech Clinton gave. Third, mainstream media members and GOP establishment pundits surround themselves with minorities who speak "Politically Correct English. " They went to the same schools. Are from the same zip codes. Roll in the same social circles. But there are a lot of politically incorrect and   minorities who are not ashamed to watch and enjoy WWE rasslin’ who may find Trump’s message as respective as   union workers. When the media ask Trump about his current    favorability ratings with minorities, he should point out that campaigns are run to change perceptions. And Trump’s GOP presidential campaign has already changed the perception of Republican voters who viewed him so unfavorably when he entered the race.] 11:43: Newt on Trump’s presser: Trump’s decision to hold a serious press conference instead of a campaign speech was masterful and a great contrast to Cruz and Rubio.  —   Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) March 2, 2016,  11:37: MN GOP caucus winners over the years: MN GOP caucus winners:2016  —   Rubio2012  —   Santorum2008  —   Romney, Strong record of choosing winners! https:  .   —   Andrew Good (@Drewbueno) March 2, 2016,  11:35: Rubio having a tough time spinning the press: No joke.

Democrats simply aren’t being energized by Hillary Clinton’s calculated campaign to maintain the status quo or Bernie Sanders’ fringe calls for a socialist ‘revolution,’" RNC Chair Priebus says in a statement. "The Democrat Primary has become a race to the far left between an embattled frontrunner facing an FBI investigation and a   socialist who continues to win states and outraise the Clinton machine. At the end of the day, Democrats are saddled with two fundamentally flawed candidates destined to fail in a general election and a message that isn’t resonating or in line with the majority of Americans.

RT: @rickklein: Rubio: "we will win FL, I promise you that."  —   Mark Krikorian (@MarkSKrikorian) March 2, 2016,  10:21: Cruz accuses Trump of supporting cronyism and says he will end corporate welfare, adopt a flat tax, and abolish the IRS. Cruz says Trump funded the "Gang of Eight" while he led the successful opposition to the Gang of Eight’s amnesty plan. He rips Trump for supporting Planned Parenthood while he will direct the Justice Dept. to investigate Planned Parenthood. He says, unlike Trump, he will never compromise away our religious liberties and or Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. Cruz says he will rip away the catastrophic Iran nuclear deal. Cruz says he understands those who are "angry with Washington" and accuses Trump of being part of the Washington corruption for 40 years. Cruz calls on Trump to release the NY Times    interview about immigration. He says voters have a right to know if he is lying to the voters about immigration. [Tony Lee: Trump’s press conference made him look different tonight. He stood out as a   and did not sound like one with his unconventional press conference. Cruz and Clinton sound like typical   when their speeches are compared to Trump’s press conference. Which candidate tonight spoke the language of the voters?] 10:19: Cruz says Republicans in the next primary states have a choice to make. He says America shouldn’t have a president whose words would embarrass them. He says our president should make us proud and inspire hope in all of us. "We can nominate a Washington dealmaker —  profane and vulgar —  who has a lifelong power of using government power for personal gain," Cruz says. "Or we can nominate a proven conservative who has fought consistently for working men and women and to defend the Constitution. " 10:17: Cruz says "tonight, this campaign enters a new phase. " Cruz says a Trump nomination would be a disaster for Republicans. He says his campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, can beat, and will beat Donald Trump. Cruz proudly says he has beaten Trump three times. [But if a baseball teams plays five   sets against an opponent and loses 12 of them, is that something to brag about?] 10:15: "God Bless the Lone Star state," Cruz says. "And God Bless the great state of Oklahoma. " Senator Cruz victory party is at the redneck Country Club in Stafford. A podium and teleprompter are in place pic. twitter.   —   Phil Archer (@PhilArcher_KPRC) March 2, 2016,  10:13: Fox News’s Megyn Kelly and CNN’s Jeff Lord agree tonight. They both said Trump looked "presidential" during his press conference. [Tony Lee: As I said when Rubio first started with his juvenile attacks that his   on Twitter gleefully cheered, his attacks may have done him a huge disservice by turning off just enough   voters in the suburbs. It could have cost him Virginia and prevented him from meeting the 20% threshold in various states. What a bunch of geniuses in the "GOP smart set. " I hope they are enjoying patting themselves on the head or whatever the equivalent is on Twitter tonight. Good job, guys. Way to go!] 10:06: Reporter mischaracterizes Trump’s "negotiable" comments. Trump says if he wants a   wall, he will negotiate it down to 48 feet to appease more people. When asked about establishment Republicans trying to throw monkey wrenches into the delegate selection process, Trump says he has "millions and millions of people" who are providing tremendous energy for Republicans. Trump says it would be undemocratic if GOP   (and desperate professional pundits who so desperately want to be "influencers" on the right) try to steal the nomination from him at the convention. Trump says "nobody is going to beat us" after GOP is unified. 10:02: Trump says he always liked Marco before he decided to go "hostile" and become a   Don Rickles. Trump says Rubio’s " " attacks hurt him. "He had a bad night," Trump said, according to CNN, Fox. Trump says at least you can say that "Ted has won something. " Trump says "our infrastructure" is going to hell after he says that Paul Ryan will "pay a price" if he doesn’t get along with him. Trump says even the media will be proud of him as president. He says "Hillary Clinton doesn’t have a clue" about rebuilding the country. Trump says Clinton’s record as Secretary of State was "abysmal. " Trump says what Clinton did was a "criminal act" and if she is allowed to run, "it will be a sad day for this country" because "what she did was wrong. And other people have done far less than her and they paid a very, very big price.

" Trump says Muslim migrants are "young" and "strong" and "powerful" and we have "no idea who they are. " Trump says he has a heart so we will build a safe zone in Syria. He says he will loosen up the wallets of the Gulf States so they can pay for the safe zone. 9:56: "We are going to have a wall," Trump says. Trump says he has thousands of Hispanic workers. Trump says the Mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders. Trump says Fox used the "ultimate word" because he was angry that someone dared to say that Mexico will pay for the wall. Trump says "100%. Mexico is going to pay. " Trump talks about the country’s heroin problem and he says he’s going to "stop it" because "we’re going to have a strong border. " He says people are going to come in and they are going to come in legally. 9:55: Trump says he’ll make deals as president that are good for the American people. He blasts Obama for using executive actions. Then he pivots to corporate inversion and says Obama doesn’t know how to make deals to bring money back to the United States. 9:49: Trump says he is "doing what’s right" when asked if he is moving to the center for the general election. He again praises Planned Parenthood for helping millions but says it should not receive taxpayer funding so long as it performs abortion. He says he is going to be "really good for women" and for "women’s health issues. " Trump says he is more conservative than anybody on the military, on the border, on the wall, on getting rid of Obamacare, and getting rid of Common Core. Trump says he is a  . Trump says he feels "awfully good" when asked if he feels like the "presumptive nominee. " Trump says he is watching the CNN people, the MSNBC people, and the Fox people. He quips that he is becoming very "diplomatic. " He says the networks are declaring Rubio the "big loser" tonight. Trump congratulates Cruz for his Texas win, saying it was a "big get.

Carrier  ) but these don’t seem to be on Hillary’s radar (or teleprompter).  —   Jon Feere (@JonFeere) March 2, 2016,  9:47: Trump says "we are expanding the Republican Party" after calling Sen. Sasse ( ) a loser for saying he will support neither Trump nor Clinton. Trump says he is a "unifier. " "Once we get all of this finished, I’m going to go after one person —  HIllary Clinton —  on the assumption that she will be allowed to run. " Trump says it is going to be an "easy race. " 9:46: Trump is holding a press conference after his victory speech. His campaign should say that is another way that differentiates him from Clinton, who went nearly 90 days without facing the press. 9:44: Trump says we can’t keep losing manufacturing jobs. Trump says we have "tremendous power" over everybody but we have politicians " that truly, truly truly don’t know what they’re doing. " Trump says he is "honored" by this evening’s results. 9:43: Stunning map of Trump’s "across the board" support: No Republican nominee has ever won all of the different states Donald Trump has https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) March 2, 2016,  9:40: Trump says this has been an "amazing evening. " Trump congratulates Cruz for winning Texas for an "excellent win. " Trump says he watched Clinton’s speech and says Clinton has been there for so long and if she hasn’t straightened it out, she won’t do so as president. Trump says making America great again is much better than "making America whole" again. Trump again, Trump says Rubio has had a "tough night" but says he is a "lightweight. " Trump says special interests and the lobbyists who want "their little Senator" do what they want are going to spend $25 million to oppose Trump. Drudge’s take: Media will keep up urgency on Republican side until Florida  —    no matter what!  Ad revenue much needed. #SuperTuesday,  —   MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) March 2, 2016,  9:38: Christie declares Trump "the clear winner" tonight. He says tonight is the beginning of Donald Trump bringing the Republican Party together for a big victory in November. He says it is the beginning of Trump bringing the people together to allow America to win again. Christie says the goal is to prevent Clinton from winning the election. 9:37: May not be a good night for Rubio: Rubio is on the "bubble" for getting ANY delegates in the following states  —   hovering at or below 20%   partial results:AL TX TN VT,  —   Alana Abramson (@aabramson) March 2, 2016,  Rubio may not only lose every race tonight, he could be shut out of delegates in five states by missing the 20% threshold.

Clinton says she is so glad to be here with you in Florida. She congratulates Sanders on his "strong showing" and says she is grateful for everyone who voted for her. Clinton again repeats the line that American never stopped being great. She says we have to "make America whole. " We have to "fill in what’s been hollowed out. " Crowd chanting "USA, USA. " Good stagecraft from Clinton’s campaign —  copying Trump (shows they are worried about Trump’s appeal). Clinton supporters waving American flags. Again calls for more love and kindness. Trump mocked Clinton earlier, asking what in the world she means when she talks about having to "make America whole again. " Clinton is yelling about defending the rights of every single   group on the left. Clinton also pivots to Flint in a way and speaks about the city in a way that differentiates herself from Sanders ahead of Michigan’s primary. Clinton says it is clear tonight that the stakes in this election have never been higher and the rhetoric has never been lower. "Trying to divide America between us and them is wrong and we’re not going to let it work," she says. 8:52: Arkansas update: AR Statewide Republican numbers latest: Trump: 32% Rubio 28% Cruz 28% #ARNews #SuperTuesday #ARpx #KATV7,  —   Angela Rachels (@arachels) March 2, 2016,  8:50: Coulter on Rubio’s establishment fans: In VA, Rubio crushing in all the districts where govt workers, govt contractors, think tank employees and lobbyists live.  —   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 2, 2016,  FiveThirtyEight: "Surprise, surprise (OK, not really): Rubio has a Beltway fan club.

"This party does not prey on people’s prejudices," Ryan told reporters Tuesday, referencing Trump in everything but name. Ryan is obviously frustrated he even has to point out that a presidential candidate in his party shouldn’t accept support from white supremacists. But we’d posit Ryan’s frustration stems not just from what Trump says but also from how powerless Ryan knows he is to stop Trump, both from saying these kinds of things and from potentially winning the nomination. 1:02  —   Team Kasich touting    Ohio victory versus Trump: 17 points, Mr. Trump. 17 points. pic. twitter.   —   John Kasich (@JohnKasich) March 1, 2016,  12:49  —   Bloomberg does some number crunching on Trump’s media monopoly strategy: All told, Trump’s     punch effectively deflated Rubio’s hopes of dominating the   Tuesday media narrative following his feisty debate performance.
