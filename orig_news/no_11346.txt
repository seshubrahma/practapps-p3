Rapper 2 Chainz takes on Donald Trump and challenges   stereotypes in a new music video released Thursday. [In the    video for his song "100 Joints," the   rapper joins a   family going about an ordinary day  —   grocery shopping, praying at a mosque, and watching Trump on TV in a living room.   The video begins with two quotes from Trump: "There is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population," the first quote, reportedly from Trump’s campaign website, reads. The second quote reads: "Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. " The rest of the video for "100 Joints"  —   a track off of the rapper’s latest album with Lil Wayne, ColleGrove  —   finds 2 Chainz donning a keffiyeh and joining the Muslim family on an ordinary day. The video ends with another quote, this one from Chainz himself: "Muslim Americans live their day to day life just like all other Americans. They are not all terrorist that hate America [sic]. " This isn’t Chainz’s first foray into the political arena last year, the rapper told XXL magazine that he would consider running for mayor in his hometown of College Park, Georgia in the future.
