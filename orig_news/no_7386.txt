On this weekend’s broadcast of "Fox News Sunday," former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will make his choice for a vice president running mate about "two days before Cleveland," at the RNC convention.  Partial transcript as follows: WALLACE: All right. Anyway, finally, every time you are here we play the running mate game. You always say, "I’m better than that, and no, I’m not. " Here is my question this time. GINGRICH: You even preempted my comment. WALLACE: Here is my question this time. Are you being vetted? Have  —   GINGRICH: No. WALLACE: You have not submitted any information  —   GINGRICH: No. Nobody has called me. Nobody said, would you like to be? Nobody said, would you be willing to be considered? Nobody said anything. WALLACE: Well, given the fact we’re three weeks away, what does that say to you? GINGRICH: He’s probably going to start thinking about it two days before Cleveland. WALLACE: Are you serious? GINGRICH: Yes. I think Donald Trump does not want to make a decision until the convention. I think that he is a very decisive person. In case of a few of us  —   I’m an example  —   there’s not much vetting to do. I mean, you guys have been all over me for a decade. (LAUGHTER) WALLACE: The good, the bad and the ugly, right? GINGRICH: Exactly right. It’s all out. All you’re going to do is Google. (  WFB) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
