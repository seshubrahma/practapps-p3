’  ’ ’   Republican nominee Donald Trump, who trailed Hillary Clinton by   near double digits in the state of New Hampshire last month, has   suddenly mounted a comeback in the key battleground state. ’ ’   Three polls in the Granite State released Thursday showed Trump   at least tied with Clinton, the Democratic nominee, in the state.   In one survey, he gained a   advantage, and in another, he   was up 5 points. ’ "   It was a pointed shift from just more than a week ago, when   Clinton led by an average of 8 points in the  of the   state. The swing comes amid signs that a turbulent week for the   Clinton campaign  —   including the news of the FBI’s  into her private   email server  —   has taken a toll on the Democratic nominee’s poll   numbers. " "   A Boston   University poll that showed the race   deadlocked at 42% for example, found that 49% of New Hampshire   voters said the revelations made them less likely to support   Clinton, while 45% said they wouldn’t affect their votes. " ’   "Both Trump and Clinton seek to win 48% of the New Hampshire   vote, which should be good enough to win the state," said David   Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research   Center. ’ ’   The shift in New Hampshire is especially important for Trump,   whose path to victory could rely on the state. Trump victories in   the swing states of Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and Nevada,   along with New Hampshire, could provide him the necessary 270   electoral votes needed to win the presidency. ’ ’   Polls in those battleground states and nationally have been      as the November 8 election rapidly approaches. ’ ’  ’
