On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s "New Day," TheRoot. com Politics Editor Dr. Jason Johnson argued that   Donald Trump might pick former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney as Secretary of State to get him out of Washington in the same way President Obama "took Hillary Clinton, who has been one of his biggest critics, made her Secretary of State and told her to get out of the country. "  Johnson said, "There’s an element to this that you sometimes see when someone is like the President of the United States. They may choose some of their most vocal critics, who are still within their party, and give them prominent positions that will take them out of Washington. What did   Barack Obama do? He took Hillary Clinton, who has been one of his biggest critics, made her Secretary of State and told her to get out of the country. So, that may be one of the ideas behind the Trump administration. " He added that Kellyanne Conway’s statements about Trump’s base being angry with Romney "disorganized," "unprofessional," and set a bad precedent for how the administration will work.
