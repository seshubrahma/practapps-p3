As part of an ongoing effort to defend his embattled family philanthropy, Bill Clinton spent the week pleading the case with   voters that his troubled charity did not "solve every problem," but what is important is that it tried. ["All we’ve done is save lives," the former president told voters in Detroit on Monday.  "I got tickled the other day when Mr. Trump called my foundation a criminal enterprise," he said in Durham, N. C. on Tuesday. "If creating jobs and saving lives is bad," Mr. Clinton said Wednesday in Orlando, "I guess you can zing me with it. " Saving lives and making   medicine available to the poor is not why "several FBI field offices" asked the Justice Department to investigate the murky connections between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. While Bill Clinton was "creating jobs and saving lives," he was also being paid $500, 000 by a   bank to give a single speech in Moscow. Hillary Clinton was using her position as secretary of state to give Clinton Foundation donors weapons deals, and her brother was scoring a rare Haitian "Gold Exploitation Permit" worth millions of dollars. Despite the charity work, the Clinton Foundation received hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign funders, many of whom received favorable treatment from Hillary Clinton’s State Department.   claims of corruption have voters, including Democrats, seriously doubting Hillary Clinton’s honesty and trustworthiness. The allegations of corruption at the Clinton Foundation  —   first made in Clinton Cash  —   as reported by media outlets across the ideological spectrum, have led to a majority of voters saying the Clintons did not do enough to avoid conflicts of interest in donations to their troubled charity.
