(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The death toll from a 6.  earthquake in Italy continues to grow, and rescue teams are becoming less hopeful of finding survivors amid the rubble. At least 250 people in central Italy were killed by the quake, which leveled buildings in several towns early Wednesday and has continued to jolt the region with hundreds of aftershocks. Myanmar is also sorting through the damage caused by a different earthquake on Wednesday: Though it was stronger than the one in Italy, only a few deaths have been reported. ______ 2. Hillary Clinton delivered a blistering attack on Donald Trump during a speech in Nevada, accusing him of "taking hate groups mainstream" and giving radical fringe groups a national megaphone. Mr. Trump’s indication that he might retreat from his vow to deport all immigrants who are in the United States illegally drew criticism across the political spectrum, if for different reasons. He appeared at a rally in Mississippi with Nigel Farage, the British politician credited with leading the Brexit movement, who compared voting for Mr. Trump to "doing what we did for Brexit in Britain. " ______ 3. Regardless of which presidential candidate you’re supporting or whether you even plan to vote this fall, there’s a good chance you’ve seen a lot of political content on Facebook. The social network has been a successful home for partisan pages with names you’ve probably never heard of before  —   their content might be created by people overseas, their audiences are cumulatively in the tens of millions of people and a single website can rake in $60, 000 a month. "It’s like a meme war," said Rafael Rivero, who runs one of the pages, "and politics is being won and lost on social media. " So is a lot of money. ______ 4. The Turkish military sent more tanks into Syria as it continued its most significant offensive yet in the conflict there. The effort, backed by American air support, is to oust Islamic State militants from a border town, but Turkish officials have made little secret that the main purpose is to prevent Kurdish militias  —   some of which have been crucial allies of the U. S.  —   from seizing more territory in the region. In Afghanistan, a   siege on the prestigious American University in Kabul killed at least 13 people and wounded dozens. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Afghan government said suspicion had fallen on a faction of the Taliban based in Pakistan. ______ 5. In New York City, our effort to chronicle the life and death of each person murdered this year in one of the city’s deadliest precincts continues: Roberto Rodríguez, a Mexican immigrant, was killed in May. His death became the seventh homicide in the 40th Precinct in the South Bronx, which has since recorded several more. Mr. Rodríguez came to the U. S. hoping to earn money to build a better life for his infant son in Mexico, but wound up in a tangle of gang ties. ______ 6. Hundreds of students at the University of Texas carried brightly colored dildos with them during the first day of classes. Their point was to protest a law that lets concealed handguns be carried on campus. "It’s absurd. So, I thought, we have to fight absurdity with absurdity," said Jessica Jin, an organizer of the protest. ______ 7. Sonia Rykiel, the rebellious fashion designer who found success by aiming to create "clothes for everyday life," died Thursday from complications of Parkinson’s disease. She was 86. Ms. Rykiel’s designs celebrated pregnancy, popularized   skirts and sweaters, and caught on with women around the world. Her career spanned nearly a   and left a lasting impact on the industry. ______ 8. Happy 100th birthday to the U. S. national parks system. President Woodrow Wilson signed the act that created the National Park Service on this day in 1916. At the time, there were only 35 national parks and monuments. Today, the service manages more than 400 areas covering about 84 million acres. President Obama added 87, 500 more acres in Maine on Wednesday. ______ 9. Swimming with the dolphins in Hawaii, a popular tourist activity, may soon become a thing of the past. Federal officials have proposed rules that would prohibit swimming with or approaching within 50 yards of Hawaiian spinner dolphins. Tour operators are not pleased. But the presence of boats and swimmers has disrupted the dolphins’ habits and natural behavior, officials said. ______ 10. Lastly, if you’ve always wanted your own newspaper and have $175 to spare, now is your chance. Send the money with an essay to Ross Connelly, above, who is looking for a successor to take over The Hardwick Gazette in Vermont, a weekly newspaper that has been around since 1889. He just extended the deadline for essays to Sept. 20. ______ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
