’Businesses are nervous about the US presidential election.’ "Based on executive commentary during their firm’s quarterly conference calls, a lot of CEOs and CFOs have a sharp eye on the contest between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton." "As we’ve noted before, companies typically find a seemingly   event  —   Brexit, the weather, and so on  —   to help pin down just why they did not meet expectations or why they could have done better." ’While this may or may not be a legitimate explanation for lackluster numbers, it is certainly a popular one. Consumer sentiment has remained resilient, though a number of business have noted some slowing in various industry surveys over the last few weeks.’ ’We went through the earnings calls of firms reporting their financial results and found that many of them pegged consumer uncertainty or business uncertainty for their results.’ "We’ve got a partial list of some of the companies  —   from steel makers to investment banks to mattress makers  —   that have cited this excuse in just the last week."
