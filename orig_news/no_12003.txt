GOP frontrunner Donald Trump touted his love for Mormons during his campaign rally Friday night in Salt Lake City, Utah at the Infinity Event Center. ["The evangelicals have been so amazing," Trump said of his support from evangelical voters, then added, "Do I love the Mormons?"  The billionaire added, "I have many friends that live in Salt Lake. I have a lot of friends. By the way, Mitt Romney is not one of them. Did this guy choke? Did this guy choke? He’s a choke artist. I can’t believe. Are you sure he’s a Mormon? Are we sure?" "I’ve had many Mormons work for me," Trump continued. "They give to the church. They constantly give. Sometimes I’d make the payment directly to the church. They say they don’t want to be tempted by keeping the money. They’re amazing people and its an honor to be with you tonight, those of you that are Mormon. " The real estate mogul spoke with little to no disruption from protesters inside the event space, although there were   Sanders protesters gathered outside in opposition to Trump. Just leaving Salt Lake City,   fantastic crowd with no interruptions. Love   will be back!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 19, 2016,
