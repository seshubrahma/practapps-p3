Rock legend and KISS frontman Gene Simmons believes that Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump appeals to "tens of millions of people" forced into silence by political correctness. ["The important thing about Trump, and I’m not saying whether I’m voting for him, or Hillary [Clinton] or anybody else, is that he has changed the game," Simmons said in an interview with People. "He doesn’t want your money. This guy funds his own campaign, and he is going to say things that tens of millions of people actually say quietly because politically it’s ‘incorrect. ’"  Simmons has showered similar praises on Trump in the past. "Secretly, tens of millions, perhaps 100 million people may actually have some positive feelings about a wall," Simmons said in March. The    rocker was "fired" from Donald Trump’s The Celebrity Apprentice in 2007, but Simmons is clearly still a fan of the White House hopeful’s approach to politics. "I think people are sick and tired of politicians who have words that are written by other people," Simmons said. "And they are trying to cater and make everybody happy  …     He doesn’t care. " Asked whether he would accept the coveted position of vice president, Simmons said: "Honestly, it doesn’t pay enough. Even God passes the hat around.
