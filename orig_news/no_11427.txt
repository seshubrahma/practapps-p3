" A report completed by the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) earlier this year found that the number of homicides committed in major cities during the first half of this year rose by more than 15 percent, and overall violent crime rose by more than two percent compared to the first half of 2015. The San Jose Police Department was included in the MCCA’s report as one of 29 of the 51 major cities listed whose police departments reported having increases in the number of homicides. Other California police departments include the Long Beach PD, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Dept. Los Angeles PD and the San Diego PD. This past June, San Jose police departments faced criticism for what the Associated Press described as "tepid and tardy law enforcement response to attacks of Donald Trump supporters after a political rally" in that city.
