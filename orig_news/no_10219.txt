Donald Trump responded late Friday afternoon to the announcement that Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) said he would be voting for him. ["I am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz. We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent," Trump responded in a press release Friday afternoon. "I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again. "  After not endorsing Trump during his speech at the Republican National Convention, Cruz decided to announce he would be voting for the Republican nominee via Facebook on Friday. "After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump," Cruz wrote. "I’ve made this decision for two reasons," he continued. "First, last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I intend to keep my word. Second, even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable  —   that’s why I have always been #NeverHillary. "
