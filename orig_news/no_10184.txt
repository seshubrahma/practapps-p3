On this weekend’s broadcast of "Fox News Sunday," Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said he thinks Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan ( ) will endorse presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump "not too much longer in the distant future. "  Priebus said "Well, listen, I don’t speak for Paul Ryan, but what I can tell you is that I think both of these guys came into the meeting expecting a good meeting, but I think they left and it was a great meeting. I think they made a lot of progress and I would be  —   I would be surprised if we didn’t get there, you know, not too much longer in the distant future.  So I think it was a good meeting and I take Paul at his word. He wouldn’t go do a press conference and say the things that he has said just to say them. He believes it and he’s sincere, but he wants to make sure it’s real, he doesn’t want to just put on a show. He wants to understand and make sure there’s a real understanding of each other before he makes that endorsement. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
