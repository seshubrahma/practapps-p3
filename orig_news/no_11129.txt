Kid Rock has endorsed Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump’s White House bid. [In a new interview with Rolling Stone which was conducted before the Iowa Caucuses, the rocker said, "I’m digging Trump. I feel like a lot of people, whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican, feel like if you get Hillary or Bernie, or you get Rubio or Cruz or whoever, there’s going to be the same s —  t. "  Kid Rock continued, "Has that much f —  king changed when anyone’s in office, whether it’s been a Republican or a Democrat in office, in our lifetime, anyway? I haven’t really seen this big, like, f —  king change. Obviously some people f —  ked up. " "That’s a long debate," he said. "My feeling: Let the motherf —  king business guy run it like a f —  king business. " The musician also told the publication he feels Trump will end up winning the Republican nomination. "To me, I’m just like, ‘We gotta try something else.’ And   …     I’m not an expert at political science or anything. I do try to follow things, obviously. I’m a pretty good, taxpaying citizen of this country," he said. Kid Rock concluded: "Let the business guy in there. It’s not really working too well running it not like a business. I mean, what business f —  king survives when they’re f —  king broke?" The rocker previously accused President Obama of being a divisive leader. "I played Barack Obama’s inauguration even though I didn’t vote for him," he said in a January 2015 interview with Guardian. "I didn’t agree with his policies, but there was an exciting sense of change in the air. " Kid Rock added, "that promise hasn’t been fulfilled, the country is more divided than ever. " He campaigned for Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential election.
