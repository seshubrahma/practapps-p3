’  ’ ’   Two Secret Service officers were fired for their role in a March   incident where a man jumped over the White House fence, . ’ ’   Both officers from the Uniformed Division had been with the   Secret Service for less than one year and were assigned to guard   the Treasury Building and the entrance to East Executive Avenue. ’ ’   "The men and women of the Secret Service are extremely   disappointed and angry in how the events of March 10 transpired,"   a Secret Service  read last month. ’ ’   The    intruder, Jonathan Tran, defeated a series of   deterrents before Secret Service agents caught him last month. He   jumped a fence near the Treasury Building, climbed a     fence, and an   gate  —   plus another       foot fence. ’ ’   Tran ended up making it nearly to the main door of the executive   mansion, even managing to rattle the door knob, before he was   captured. ’ ’’ ’   Although several alarm sensors were triggered during the   intrusion, officials estimated Tran had been on White House   grounds undetected for 15 minutes. ’ "   President Donald Trump, who was in the vicinity, was alerted of   the incident and security personnel raised the Secret Service’s   threat condition. Trump praised the protection agency for its   efforts the next day. " ’   "The service did a fantastic job," Trump said. "It was a troubled   person. It was very sad." ’ ’Two Secret Service officers were fired for. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
