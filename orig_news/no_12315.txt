Bannon a "Nazi" on Sunday during an interview with journalist Evan Solomon of Canada’s CTV. [Appearing on CTV’s Question Period, Dean commented on   Donald J. Trump’s recent appointments.  "He’s a complicated guy," Dean said, referring to Trump. "He appoints a reasonable person, who’s much more conservative than I am, but someone you can talk to, as his Chief of Staff  —   and then the senior’s adviser’s a Nazi," Dean exclaimed. The interviewer interjected. "OK, hang on. Slow down. This is interesting. You’re talking about Reince Priebus, who is the chairman of the Republican National Party [sic] right? He’s now [Trump’s] Chief of Staff. Steve Bannon, who ran something called Breitbart News  —  " Dean interrupted: "Which is a   antisemitic publication. " "You called him a Nazi?" Solomon asked, incredulous. "Well, He’s antisemitic, he’s   and he’s " Dean said. "People like to throw around this word,  ‘Nazi.’ It’s a pretty big word," Solomon said. Dean replied: "It’s a big word. I don’t usually use it unless somebody’s really antisemitic, really misogynist, really  . " "You really believe he’s that  —   I mean, again, he  —  " Solomon asked, before being interrupted. "You go look at Breitbart News, you’ll make up your own mind," Dean said. Solomon pointed out that Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, had married an Orthodox Jew. "How do you square the circle?" "That’s a very good question. I have no idea how he squares the circle," Dean said.

He then ran for president in 2004 on a leftist platform, and was considered a favorite to win his party’s nomination until his infamous "Dean scream" after losing the Iowa caucuses to  . John Kerry ( ). He served as chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2009, building up the online networks that would eventually help propel Barack Obama to victory.
