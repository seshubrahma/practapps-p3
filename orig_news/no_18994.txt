’  ’ ’   Donald Trump gave some fire to a crowd of supporters chanting   during a campaign rally in Colorado Springs on Friday. ’ ’   While lambasting Hillary Clinton over the FBI’’s investigation   into her use of a private email server at the State   Department, the crowd reprised the   "lock her up"   chant that gained traction . ’ ’   That chant was repeated vigorously throughout the   convention, but Trump had demurred when it broke out,   saying instead that he would beat Clinton on Election Day. ’ ’   But the   mogul signaled   his approval during the Friday rally. Speaking over the   chants, Trump said, "I’’ve been saying, let’’s just beat her   on November 8." ’ ’   "But you know what?" he added. "I’’m starting to agree with you." ’ ’   "Every time I mention her, everyone screams, ’’Lock her up’’ . ..   and you know what I do, I’’ve been nice. But after watching that   performance [on Thursday] night  —   such lies  —   I don’’t have to be   so nice anymore. I’’m taking the gloves off," he said. ’ ’   The room erupted in cheers. ’ ’   Clinton formally accepted the Democratic nomination for   president on Thursday night. In her   speech,   she took several jabs at Trump, including  the Republican presidential   candidate in a nutshell. ’ ’   Said Clinton: "A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man you   can trust with nuclear weapons." ’ ’   Trump spent much of the Colorado rally attacking Clinton, but he   also devoted time toward litigating past controversies along the   campaign trail, such as his  and his claim that   Arabs in New Jersey . ’ ’ ’
