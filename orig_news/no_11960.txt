Rapper T. I. ripped Rudy Giuliani for his   critique of Beyoncé’s   Lives Matter MTV Video Music Awards performance Sunday night, claiming the former New York City mayor "destroyed" black families by imprisoning black people "for too long. "["Who gives a f —   about what Rudy Giuliani says about music?" the Atlanta rapper told a TMZ reporter when asked about Giuliani’s biting critique of Beyoncé’s VMAs performance. "He’s not an aficionado of music. This isn’t politics. You need to worry about Trump’s campaign. "   Beyoncé put on a   performance on Sunday night featuring songs from her Black Lives   visual album Lemonade. One   moment saw Beyoncé’s backup dancers falling to the ground covered in red lights, in an apparent simulation of being "shot down" one by one. In a Monday appearance on Fox  Friends, Giuliani praised the police he commanded for the work they did to make New York City a safer place. "And I saved more black lives than any of those people you saw onstage by reducing crime, and particularly homicide, by 75 percent," Giuliani added. Asked about Giuliani’s remarks about saving black lives, T. I. said, "He also imprisoned so many unnecessarily. So you have to count against the black lives he saved for the black lives he destroyed by imprisoning people for too long, taking them away from their families, and breaking up homes. " America’s Mayor has blasted Beyoncé before. In February, Giuliani called the Grammy winner’s Black Panther Party tribute Super Bowl halftime show performance an "attack" on police officers. "This is football, not Hollywood  —   and I thought it was really outrageous that [Beyoncé] used it as a platform to attack police officers, who are the people who protect her, and protect us, and keep us alive," he said.
