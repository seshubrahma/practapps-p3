President Barack Obama assures political leaders during a visit to Vietnam that his   Trade Deal would pass eventually  —   even though all three candidates running for president remain opposed to the deal. ["I remain confident we’re going to get it done and the reason I’m confident is because it’s the right thing to do. " Obama said during a press conference with President Quang of Vietnam. "It’s good for the country. It’s good for America. It’s good for the region. It’s good for the world. "  Vietnam arguably has the most to benefit among the nations in the TPP trade deal, which could spark increased corporate investments in manufacturing. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump remain opposed to the deal, which Obama dismissed as an election year stunt. "In an election year, you can anticipate that some folks are going to try to score political points off it," he said. Obama acknowledged that the process would be "painful" and "noisy" but again assured skeptical Americans that it would be good for the economy. "I have not yet seen a credible argument that once we get TPP in place we’re going to be worse off," Obama said.
