However, it’s just so crazy that people are getting beat up because they voted for Trump, or this and that, someone wants to bomb the White House  …    .I am an American, I moved here from the Philippines and I highly believed in the trueness of what this country can bring. It’s about bringing people together, that’s the message. " Soriano, who has designed red carpet gowns for singers Macy Gray and Courtney Love, says President Trump is "going to do the best thing" for America. "I always channel Joy’s music as a designer  —   we’re both artists and I love her so dearly," Soriano said. "She is one of the people on this planet that really promotes love. We need to move this country forward, and we believe it’s time to promote love. We only live once, and we need to promote love. We have one president now who is going to do the best thing for planet America. "   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
