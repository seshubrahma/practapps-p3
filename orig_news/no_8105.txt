Sunday on NBC’s "Meet the Press," NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was "completely uneducated about any part of the world. "  Mitchell said  "And this was a week where he could have gone after president Obama, arguably. there’s a lot happening and the president has some vulnerabilities. So does Hillary Clinton. Instead he’s all over the lot. And then The New York Times do an interview with him, a   interview and it’s in today’s paper and online. And the transcript, if you read the transcript online, he would cancel defense treaties with Japan and South Korea against North Korea. He doesn’t mind, he would be okay if Japan and South Korea go nuclear. American policy for decades since World War II has been trying to keep nukes out of that arena. " "He would stop importing oil from Saudi Arabia if they don’t pay more for their defense," she continued. "We need oil. We are not energy independent. We rely on oil still  for our daily needs. He is completely all over the lot. On Iran he complained that Iran isn’t buying our planes. It had to be pointed out to him that Iran is still under sanctions and cannot buy American planes. He thinks North Korea and Iran are the biggest trading partners when North Korea’s biggest trading partner is China. He is completely uneducated about any part of the world.
