During her acceptance speech Monday at the New York Women in Communications annual Matrix Awards luncheon,   Lena Dunham explained why she would rather die than be a man. [TV host Andy Cohen asked Dunham what she would do if she woke up one day as a man.  I’d "kill myself," the Girls star said. "The reason I said that wasn’t because I’m subscribing to an old binary," Dunham explained. "I love that fact that we’re in a time where we get to determine what gender looks and feels like to us. It was not because I wouldn’t know what to wear. It was because I feel so passionately lucky to be doing the work of being female right now. " WATCH: Dunham, an outspoken feminist, wrote in a   Clinton essay Monday that she’s not "supporting Hillary only because of our shared anatomy. I have no plans to blindly follow my uterus to the nearest polling station. " But Dunham admitted and explained in the very next paragraph "why I’m voting for Hillary Clinton. " During Monday’s event, the    producer also said that she would "100 percent" move to Canada if Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump were elected president. Trump, as Breitbart News has reported, said he would "be doing a great service to our country" if Dunham fled the United States. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
