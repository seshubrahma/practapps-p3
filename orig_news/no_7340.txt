When a Cruz supporter (Cruz’s foreign policy adviser should better know the positions of his opponents) claimed that Trump said the U. S. should get out of NATO, Blitzer, who is a foreign policy expert, immediately corrected him and said that is not what Trump said. Blitzer said Trump never said the U. S. should pull out of NATO. "He didn’t talk about pulling out of NATO," Blitzer said. "He said reduce the U. S. investment [and let the other NATO allies spend more of their GDP on NATO). " Earlier, Blitzer pointed out that Trump’s staff failed him by not telling him that Wisconsin radio host Sykes has said he is a supporter of the "Never Trump" movement while Scottie Hughes futilely tried to defend Trump’s staff. A good job by Blitzer questioning a   guest and an   guest. Many television hosts lack   expertise, especially when questioning conservatives, to effectively question guests or call them out when they misstate someone’s positions. 5:30: Fiorina in Wisconsin for Cruz: Just touched down in the land of cheese curds and the great Governor Walker.

I also understand that politically, he has no choice but to implement the de   liberal agenda. But his explanation for dismantling the unit makes no sense it ignores the nature of the threat that we face from radical Islam. Simply put, demographic trends are not static. They are dynamic. They change over time. The pockets of New York City that are fertile grounds for terrorist recruitment today may not be fertile grounds next year, and places without a significant radical presence right now may become hotbeds of terrorist activity in the future. To say that the work of a vital intelligence unit "was finished" is not plausible. It is the excuse of an administration grasping for anything to justify what was obviously a surrender to political correctness, 5:10: Kasich Super PAC Ad: Vote for Cruz Is a Vote for Clinton: 5:00: Clinton, Sanders camp arguing about delegate math: This is significant: Sanders aides have said they plan to take over   Team Clinton now saying the math is impossible for him after    —   Gabriel Debenedetti (@gdebenedetti) March 28, 2016,  "We do not envision a scenario where in New York he can dent our delegate lead significantly," says Benenson of Sanders.  —   Gabriel Debenedetti (@gdebenedetti) March 28, 2016,  4:45:   forces still outspending Trump in Wisconsin: Trump’s up to over $400k in Wisconsin advertising, per CMAG.
