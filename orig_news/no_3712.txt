In an interview with Breitbart News after the show, Villa said she wore the dress in an attempt to "bring us together and start a dialogue. " "Like hey, maybe if she is proud of what she believes in maybe I can leave her alone. Maybe I can leave my friend alone. Maybe I can leave my brother alone. Maybe I can actually still love them even though they disagree with my politics. That’s what we need. A little bit of tolerance," Villa said.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
