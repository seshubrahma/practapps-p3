Bloomberg Politics also asked GOP voters who they would like to be the face of the Republican Party if Hillary Clinton wins the 2016 election. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence  —   Trump’s running mate  —   ranked number one with 27 percent. Trump came in second with 24 percent and Paul Ryan came in fourth behind Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) with 15 percent. If Clinton wins next month, a majority of Republican voters still want either Pence or Trump to lead the GOP. https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) October 20, 2016,
