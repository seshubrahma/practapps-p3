"My feeling: Let the motherf*cking business guy run it like a f*cking business," he said of Trump in an interview with Rolling Stone. "Iâ€™m digging Trump. I feel like a lot of people, whether youâ€™re a Democrat or a Republican, feel like if you get Hillary or Bernie, or you get Rubio or Cruz or whoever, thereâ€™s going to be the same sh*t.
