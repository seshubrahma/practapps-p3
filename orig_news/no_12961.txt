Nine chairmen in the United States House of Representatives are putting their support behind Donald Trump. [Trump announced the endorsement on Facebook, listing the members who support him for president:  Steve Chabot (Small Business) Michael Conaway (Agriculture) Jeb Hensarling (Financial Services) Candice Miller (House Administration) Jeff Miller (Veteransâ€™ Affairs) Tom Price (Budget) Pete Sessions (Rules) Bill Shuster (Transportation and Infrastructure) and Lamar Smith (Science, Space and Technology). "We stand on the precipice of one of the most important elections of our lifetime. This great nation cannot endure eight more years of   of the White House," the chairmen wrote in a statement of their endorsement. "It cannot afford to put Democrats in charge of Congress. It is paramount that we coalesce around the Republican nominee, Mr. Donald J. Trump, and maintain control of both the U. S. House of Representatives and the U. S. Senate. " The statement went on: Any other outcome is a danger to economic growth, puts our national security in peril, enshrines ObamaCare as the law of the land, entraps Americans in a cycle of poverty and dependence, and undermines our constitutional republic. There is a path to winning in November, and it comes through unity. To solidify this partnership, we endorse Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee for President and call upon all Americans to support him. Trump responded to the endorsement, saying, "It is tremendous to be working with these leaders and their colleagues on winning solutions that will really move us forward. A strong House Republican Majority is imperative to fixing the problems facing America and making our country better and stronger than ever before. " The endorsement comes after Trump met with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, along with other GOP leaders, on Capitol Hill on Thursday.
