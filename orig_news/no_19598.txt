’  ’ ’   Evidence that Russia attempted to sway the outcome of the   presidential election with a hacking campaign targeting Democrats   "is the political equivalent of " the former acting director   of the CIA, Michael Morell, said in an interview published   Monday. ’ ’   Morell, an intelligence analyst who served as acting director of   the CIA twice between 2011 and 2013,  that revelations disclosed  about how Russia meddled in the election to   help get Donald Trump elected "is an attack on our very   democracy." ’ ’   "A foreign government messing around in our elections is, I   think, an existential threat to our way of life," Morell said.   "To me, and this is to me not an overstatement, this is the   political equivalent of  ." ’ "   In a secret assessment  —   the content of which has been leaked to   the press via   officials briefed on the intelligence  —     the CIA said Russia was not just trying to undermine confidence   in the US election process when it hacked the emails of the   Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign   chairman, John Podesta.
