Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told a group of supporters that it was clear she had the stamina to serve as president, after debating Donald Trump three times. ["I have now spent four and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again I have the stamina to be president and  " she said during a speech on Saturday evening in Pittsburgh.  Clinton admitted it wasn’t easy, but that every time she tried to be in a good mood and focus on the people that she had met during the campaign. "Really, you just have to be of good cheer when you find yourself in a situation like that," she said. Clinton was joined on stage by her running mate Tim Kaine, who also praised her debating skills. "Donald Trump, had been talking a lot about stamina. But, boy, at the end of those debates, he really looked like he was on the ropes," he said mockingly.  Kaine insisted that Clinton could probably do five more debates against Trump, but was eager to get back on the campaign trail.  "When the debate finished, Hillary was excited to get out and keep talking about her plans and her vision for this country," he said. "And Donald just couldn’t wait to get back to start tweeting out more insults. " She again accused Trump of acting dangerously after he refused to rule out conceding the election. "Now, make no mistake about this, my friends. He is threatening our democracy," Clinton said. Clinton specifically referred to Pennsylvania voters in Allegheny County, where she admitted were probably a lot of Trump voters. "I want you to tell them that I understand that they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them, and I want to be their president too," she said.
