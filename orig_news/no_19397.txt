’  ’ "   Half the nation is  for Donald Trump’s election. " "   And Facebook feels that’s ! " "   The argument is that Facebook now plays a huge role in the   distribution of information. Its 2 billion active users may read   traditional news sources like The New York Times and Business   Insider. But they aren’t typically visiting those websites   directly. Instead, they’re scrolling through Facebook’s news feed   and reading articles that friends share. " "   The problem is that Facebook users aren’t always good at   distinguishing legitimate news sources from satire, propaganda,   or just plain false information. And if bad information goes   viral, it can negatively influence the public’s opinion. " ’   The spreading of false information during the election cycle was   so bad that President Barack Obama called Facebook a "." ’ ’’ ’   "People if they just repeat attacks enough and outright lies over   and over again, as long as it’’s on Facebook and people can see   it, as long as its on social media, people start believing it,"   he said. ’ "   But Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t seem to get that. " ’   "Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook  —   it’’s a   very small amount of the content  —   influenced the election in any   way is a pretty crazy idea," . ’ ’   That seems a bit tone deaf. ’ ’   If Facebook wants to be a platform where billions of people   regularly find and share news, then it needs to accept some of   the responsibility that comes with that power. That means coming   up with some guidelines to help spread information responsibly. ’ "   It’s not hard to see why Facebook is reluctant to do this. The   internet was built on the legal foundation that online companies   are not liable for   content displayed on their sites. " ’   Acting as an information gatekeeper and making editorial   decisions is a difficult and messy business. Facebook learned   this earlier this year when a person who worked on the project   told Gizmodo that contractors Facebook employed  from the   trending news section. ’ "   Facebook’s response to the controversy was to  and let its algorithm decide which   stories appear in the trending news box. Clearly, more work   . " "   But there’s good news: Facebook doesn’t need to reinvent the   wheel. Google has already spent two decades battling the   distribution of bad content online. Facebook can adopt this by: " ’   Google has built an algorithm that prioritizes the quality and   relevance of an article. Anyone can write anything online, but   not just any piece of content will show up in the first few pages   of a Google search result. ’ "   It’s not perfect  —   just ask former Sen. Rick Santorum, who was   the  in which a webpage   characterizing him in vulgar terms rose to the top of search   results. " ’   But Google takes its responsibility to surface the right   information seriously  —   in part because its business depends on   it  —   and by and large, people trust that the top results on   Google will be legitimate. ’ "   Google also examines the source of the article carefully. It has   an application process for publishers that want to be part of its   Google News or AMP  —   accelerated mobile pages  —   programs. Then it   has a team carefully review each applicant and reject a site if   it doesn’t meet quality standards. " ’   Sites are evaluated on a number of things, including their   "authority" on a subject matter, their "journalistic standards,"   their ability to show "accountability" for content through proper   attribution and author bio pages, and more. If a site is   rejected, it can reapply a few months later. ’ "   Facebook’s Instant Articles, by contrast, don’t seem to require   much vetting at all. Instant Articles launched in closed beta,   with a few   partners. But now it appears open to   almost any site that has the required tech specifications. The   only requirement listed on the Instant Articles FAQ page for   publishers is that the content does not run afoul of Facebook’s   community standards, which bans things like sexually explicit   content and violent threats. " "   Now that Facebook is such an important part of the news cycle,   its vetting process needs to mature. It should evaluate the   person who is sharing a piece of content on Facebook, weigh the   quality of the link being shared, and then determine how far a   friend’s status message should really spread. " "   Coming up with this sort of process isn’t censorship. It’s just   being responsible. " ’ This is an editorial. The opinions and conclusions expressed   above are those of the author. ’
