Saturday following GOP presidential   Donald Trump’s victory in the South Carolina Republican primary, political consultant Roger Stone explained to Fox News Channel’s Hannity that Trump’s path to victory was to unite the   "  vote. "  "You just described the path victory for Donald Trump," Stone said. "The   vote, which is repudiating the foreign policy, immigration policy, trade policy, fiscal policies of the Bush wing of the Republican party is in a majority, which is why Trump will ultimately be the nominee. When they say oh, well Bush getting out, that’ll strengthen Marco Rubio, yes, but Ben Carson’s votes and ultimately Ted Cruz’s votes, they will end up disproportionately with Donald Trump. That’s how he’s going to triumph. " (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
