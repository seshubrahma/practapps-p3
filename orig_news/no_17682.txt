’  ’ ’   DAVOS, SWITZERLAND  —   The main topic of conversation at the World   Economic Forum last week was the fate of the world under the US   Presidency of Donald J. Trump. ’ ’   Views on this topic ranged from fear to greed.  ’ ’   At a private lunch on Thursday, a number of     attendees were asked to share a   few thoughts about life under Trump. One of them was   Jamie Dimon, the CEO of the US financial services firm, JP Morgan   Chase. ’ ’   Dimon has an admirable ability to rise above the consensus and   noise and put things in a way people can relate to. His   remarks were insightful and compelling.  ’ "   Like most of the lunch speakers, Dimon did not   share detailed personal views of Trump or Trump’s plans.    Given the power of the Presidency, as well as today’s   polarized political climate, there is too much at stake   for that.  Instead, Dimon provided a   broader perspective  —   of technological progress, of the   challenges in our society and economy, and of the Trump   Administration. " ’’ ’   Most Davos events are off the record unless   speakers agree otherwise. After the lunch, Dimon kindly   gave us permission to share the remarks below. ’
