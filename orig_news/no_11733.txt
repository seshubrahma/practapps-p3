" WASHINGTON (AP)  —  South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham says he expects to see more establishment GOP support shifting to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz following Cruz’s commanding win Tuesday night in Wisconsin. Graham is supporting Cruz himself though he acknowledges it’s despite disagreement with many of his tactics. But Graham argues that Donald Trump would destroy the Republican Party for generations to come, wiping out any chance of appealing to Hispanics, young people and others. He says that Cruz is a reliable Republican "and will not alienate   of the country. " And he says he’s making that argument to fellow GOP lawmakers and anyone else who will listen. Graham also says Kasich is "probably our most electable Republican" but that he’s not performing well in the primary. Graham notes that he himself chose to drop out of the presidential race, and "Personally I don’t see a pathway for John," but "I’m not going to tell John what to do.

SAN JOSE  —   Bay Area GOP political consultant Matt Shupe is betting that the Bay Area and Silicon Valley may be where Donald Trump is finally be stopped cold in the Republican race for the White House, and where Ohio Gov. John Kasich finally gets his due. Weeks ago, "I walked my neighborhood in Danville to collect nomination signatures for my central committee campaign, and most of the registered Republicans I spoke to asked me who my pick for president was,’’ Shupe told POLITICO California on Tuesday. "Every single one of them told me theirs was Kasich. " 11:59: WaPo’s Philip Bump says Trump lost Wisconsin not because of his "bad week with women" but because of the GOP establishment coalescing behind Cruz. Regardless of all the nonsense that’s transpired over the last week, Donald Trump was always going to lose Wisconsin. The last time he had consistent leads in major polls in the state was at the end of February, before the field was winnowed down to three people. The Wisconsin Republican establishment, as we noted Tuesday night, leaned its full, impressive weight against Trump, and it prevailed. For all of the uselessness of The Narrative around the contest, there’s one point that’s worth picking out. After two weeks of Donald Trump haranguing Ted Cruz’s wife Heidi and taking 42, 389 different positions on abortion  —   including broaching the idea of punishing women who undergo illegal abortions, and then walking it back  —   he didn’t do any worse with women than he did with men in the state, according to exit poll data reported by CNN. That’s actually unusual. In every other state for which we have exit or entrance poll data, Trump has done slightly or substantially better with men. 11:52: Politico reporting that Corey Lewandowski is fighting to protect his influence in the Trump campaign: Behind the scenes, Lewandowski is fighting to preserve his own power and to box out Paul Manafort, who was hired last month to lead the campaign’s delegate corralling effort. "Corey and his people know the knives are out for them," said one source close to the campaign, referring to Manafort as a "pretty experienced  . " On Saturday, Lewandowski went as far as to fire a young operative named James Baker, who’d been recently put in charge of its Colorado campaign —  he’d arrived in the state less than 48 hours earlier —  because he’d been communicating with Manafort after Lewandowski instructed him not to do so, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed. Manafort is scheduled to meet with Trump in New York Wednesday morning and likely to threaten to quit if he doesn’t see more cooperation, according to one source. "If Manafort walks, this thing comes apart," they said. "And some of the people close to him are ready to walk. " 11:50: Last night, Mexico swapped out its ambassador to the U. S. citing Trump: MEXICO CITY (Reuters)  —   Mexico’s government on Tuesday unexpectedly changed two of its top officials responsible for U. S. relations, citing concerns about an increasingly   climate across the border. Carlos Sada, previously the consul in Los Angeles, was named ambassador to the United States while Paulo Carreno, one of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s communications chiefs, was appointed the deputy foreign minister for North America. The new ambassador must still be approved by the Senate. "We have been warning that our citizens have begun to feel a more hostile climate," Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu told local radio after the announcement. "This ( ) rhetoric has made it clear that we have to act in a different way so that this tendency being generated doesn’t damage the bilateral relationship," she added. Mexican government officials have expressed concern about the rise of Republican presidential   Donald Trump due to his repeated verbal attacks on Mexico, and his insistence that Mexico should be made to pay for a border wall. 11:34: WaPo: Trump needs to win almost   of remaining delegates.
