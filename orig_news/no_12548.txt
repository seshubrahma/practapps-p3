Sunday on CNN’s "State of the Union," presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s convention manager Paul Manafort said Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton will face a bigger difficulty getting the support of men than Trump will with women.  Manafort said, "This is one of these conventional wisdom facts that are not correct. Yes there’s some high negatives on the part of Trump right now who has just come out of a spirited contest. Hillary Clinton has got high negatives, too. When you look at the recent Quinnipiac polls came out last week which show Trump winning in Florida and even slightly ahead in Ohio and Pennsylvania, you look at the gender gaps and the real gender gap is a male gender gap on the part of Clinton where she’s got a bigger disparity between her support with men than Trump has with women.
