’  ’ ’     Donald Trump told "60 Minutes" in an   interview set to air Sunday night that he plans to come through   on one of his earliest campaign promises and deport or jail 2 to   3 million immigrants living in the country illegally upon taking   office. ’ ’   "What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and   have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of   these people, probably two million, it could be even three   million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going   to incarcerate," Trump said in the interview, . ’ ’   "But we’re getting them out of our country. They’’re here   illegally," he said. ’ ’   However, Trump seemed to soften his rhetoric on the treatment of   the other millions of immigrants living in the US illegally,   saying he would decide what to do with them after securing the     border.  ’ ’   "After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized,   we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re   talking about who are terrific people, they’re terrific people,   but we are going to make a determination at that," he said.   "But before we make that determination . .. it’s very important,   we are going to secure our border. " ’ ’’ ’   Trump also seemed to tone down his plan to secure the US’’s   southern border with a wall by telling "60 Minutes" that the wall   would include "some fencing." ’ ’   President Barack Obama,  immigrants living in the country illegally,   according to government data, substantially more than George W.   Bush did in his eight years in office.  ’
