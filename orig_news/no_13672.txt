My Dear Fellow Americans. [If you’ll recall, right here on Breitbart on June 16  2015, I wrote my first article on Donald J. Trump, and at that moment laid out the case for why I knew he was the voice America was waiting for.  I received much ridicule, even from friends. As the weeks progressed, I continued to write not only here but in other places like Newsmax and the Orange County Register, but mostly at my home here, given to me by Andrew Breitbart himself. Through the ensuing primaries I was steadfast for the Donald, as you can see from my articles or appearances on Neil Cavuto, Lou Dobbs, Chris Matthews or other shows on Fox Business. I expressed my point of view with a deep understanding of the message and power Mr. Trump held as the voice for those forgotten, ignored citizens who inherently knew our Nation was infected by elites and globalists. I had many conversations with folks in and out of politics and even known celebrities who asked me why I was such an intense supporter. With every bump in the road, with every controversy which sent many to the mats in their support for DJT, I remained steadfast and articulated my reasons for doing so. This passion never wavered, not once, especially once we hit the general election   between Trump and Hillary Clinton. America First was the battle cry we had not heard from our politicians in many years. Now, finally, a voice was speaking not only for all of us but for the nation that we love. The election is now behind us and the real work begins. We have the future of our nation to attend to, which brings me to the reason for writing this article. With the historic and monumental accomplishment we just witnessed by   Donald J. Trump, I would like to look back to one of our greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan. What I am about to refer to has about as much to do with our national security as any other issue. In his farewell speech after the astounding success of his eight years as our President, Ronald Reagan left the most important warning to the nation for his last words. I cannot stress enough this final prophetic warning by President Reagan is so prescient it begs the question of whether or not Reagan could see into the future. Interestingly, this same kind of prescience is in Donald Trump. President Reagan mentioned that what he was most proud of in his presidency was the renaissance of national pride that he called "the new patriotism. " Reagan said: "Finally, there is a great tradition of warnings in Presidential farewells, and I’ve got one that’s been on my mind for some time. But oddly enough it starts with one of the things I’m proudest of in the past eight years the resurgence of national pride that I called "the new patriotism. " This national feeling is good, but it won’t count for much, and it won’t last unless it’s grounded in thoughtfulness and knowledge. An informed patriotism is what we want. And are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what America is and what she represents in the long history of the world? Those of us who are over 35 or so years of age grew up in a different America. We were taught, very directly, what it means to be an American, and we absorbed almost in the air a love of country and an appreciation of its institutions. If you didn’t get these things from your family you got them from the neighborhood, from the father down the street who fought in Korea or the family who lost someone at Anzio. Or you could get a sense of patriotism from school. And if all else failed, you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture. The movies celebrated democratic values and implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special. TV was like that, too, through the  . " AN INFORMED PATRIOTISM! My dear fellow Americans, this is a NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE! Not many people bring this up, and this was Ronald Reagan’s most important warning! Education and Culture in America has been besieged by an American Amnesia. Our youth has been indoctrinated and deliberately confused. Our massive problem with immigration has given us the largest number of unassimilated immigrants in the history of our nation. Instead of teaching American History, what is now taught is the Bill   communist Marxist progressive   battle cry that America is a nation that should be gutted and have its heart ripped out and replaced by a socialist moral relativism that has nothing to do with National Pride but instead worships at the feet of the Globalists. Today’s films, television and music further split us apart under the guise of leading us toward an enlightened civilization, while in fact it is all about an agenda that erases God and Country from our discourse and replaces them with a teardown of the American experience, erases institutions and replaces them with a    pantheism. Take the current rioters: while some are subversive anarchists, bought and paid for by George Soros, there are others who are absolutely sincere in their protest. But those sincere souls I believe are protesting because of a failure, or should I say deliberate attempt, by   educators to not fairly teach but to propagandize and preach to students. I wrote about this danger several years ago. The question is: knowing schools across America are failing, knowing that textbooks are being rewritten to purposely lobotomize our history, is anyone surprised that we have such a divisive nation? An uninformed, indoctrinated youth and immigrant population is how the Progressive Communist left and the GOP elites gerrymander elections. This is the crisis Ronald Reagan understood was the danger facing America. With the election of the only candidate in 40 years who has understood and communicated what Ronald Reagan warned against and what We the People are feeling but unable to articulate, we have a responsibility and an unprecedented opportunity to ensure that we implement in our schools a mandate in American History and Civics that protects not only an understanding of the Constitution but the very survival of an America our Founders set forth. I call for a "New American Patriotism," and we have just the person to lead the charge: President Donald J. Trump.
