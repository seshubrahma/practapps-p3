EXPLICIT LANGUAGE WARNING]  Wednesday on CNN’s "Newsroom," while commenting on Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon taking on a new role as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign CEO, Bloomberg Businessweek writer Joshua Green, who wrote a profile piece on Bannon declared his personal motto was, "Honey badger don’t give a  . " Green said, "Bannon is just a charismatic wild man,    talker. He’s a guy who’s had this bizarre series of careers from naval officer to Goldman Sachs banker to Sarah Palin filmmaker, who fell in with Andrew Breitbart, the late conservative provocateur, and wound up taking over the Breitbart News Network after Breitbart died. He has sort of insinuated himself into the center of this   world of splinter conservatives who have bedeviled GOP establishment leaders like Paul Ryan, like John Boehner, like Jeb Bush. It makes a weird sort of serendipitous sense that he would wind up the head of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. " He continued, "I think there is always a potential for a clash, any day, any hour, in Trump world. Steve Bannon stepping in certainly doesn’t lower the odds of such a thing. But from where I sit, seems like a pretty clear move by Trump himself to decide, I’m done with this idea of trying to moderate my image, contain myself, make myself palatable to the Republican establishment. Instead, I’m going with someone who is a media person like me, which Bannon is, who is out there, and provocative and outrageous. I expect we will see more of that from Trump out on the campaign trail and certainly on the debate stage. " When asked what Bannon’s motto is, Green said, "Honey badger don’t give a shit.
