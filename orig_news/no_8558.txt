The United Educators of San Francisco, the union that represents teachers in the city’s public schools, released a controversial guide Wednesday to teaching public school children about Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in the recent election. [The guide, called the "Lesson Plan on the November 2016 Election," informs teachers that "a racist and sexist man has become the president of our country by pandering to a huge racist and sexist base," and suggests they teach children the same.  In fact, the lesson plan urges teachers not to tell students that Hillary Clinton lost the election (original emphasis): "DO NOT: Tell them that we have LOST and that we have to accept this. We do not have to accept ANYTHING except that we must and will fight for justice against an unjust system and against unjust people. " The guide also recommends that teachers allow students to use profanity when expressing their feelings about the election, because "you would too if you have suffered under the constructs of white supremacy or experienced sexism, or any isms or lack of privilege. " The Associated Press reports that the union "posted the plan on its website and distributed it via an email newsletter to its more than 6, 000 members. The school district has more than 57, 000 students. " The school district refused to condemn the plan, saying that it was optional. The Republican Party of San Francisco condemned the lesson plan, as the AP notes: "It’s inappropriate on every level," said Harmeet Dhillon, an RNC committeewoman from California. She called it "inappropriate propaganda that unfairly demonizes not only the campaign that Donald Trump, the winner, ran, but also all of the people who voted for him. " Joel B.
