Actor George Clooney went on an   Trump rant at the César Film Awards ceremony in Paris Friday night, claiming that the president is alarming America’s allies and giving "comfort to our enemies. "[While accepting his honorary award, Clooney said, "I was thinking about Edward R. Murrow," referencing his 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck, "as we find ourselves nostalgic for when America was great and when the news wasn’t fake. "  "We must not confuse dissent for disloyalty," Clooney continued, quoting Murrow. "We must not walk in fear of one another. We must not be driven by fear into an age of unreason. " Then Clooney got political. "The actions of this president have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad and given considerable comfort to our enemies. " "And whose fault is that?" the Money Monster star asked, never mentioning Trump by name. "Not really his. He didn’t create this situation of fear, he merely exploited it, and rather successfully.

"He made a lot of money off of Seinfeld. He’s elitist Hollywood. I mean, that’s the reality.
