I’ve cut that in half,’" Manjoo recalls. "Until what? ‘Apocalypse. End of the world. ’" The description of Silicon Valley as the "center of   resistance" is unsurprising, Google employees and executives previously held rallies at Google offices across the United States in protest of President Trump’s temporary travel halt from nations associated with terrorism.  yo Breitbart, stop being racist, sexist, and xenophobic. #NoBanNoWall, A post shared by JLR II (@jimmyramirez) on Jan 30, 2017 at 7:13pm PST,  Google CEO Sunar Pichai spoke to the crowd about the difficulties that the company faces when attempting to deal with visa complications that many of their foreign employees encountered.
