Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stated that North Carolina’s "bathroom law" is "causing them some problems" and that "we have to take care of everybody" while arguing "local communities and states should make the decision" on Thursday’s "Hannity" on the Fox News Channel.  Trump was asked [relevant exchange begins around 1:30] about the reaction to his criticism of the "bathroom law. " He stated the law impacts "a small number" of people, "But we have to take care of everybody, frankly. And, North Carolina, which is a great place, which I won by the way, I love North Carolina, and they have a law, and it’s a law that unfortunately, is causing them some problems, and I fully understand if they want to go through, but they are losing business, and they are having people come out against. With me, I look at it differently, a community whether it’s North Carolina, or local communities, really, they should be involved.   …     I think that local communities and states should make the decision, and I feel very strongly about that. The federal government should not be involved. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
