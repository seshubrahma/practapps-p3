HBO’s "Real Time" host Bill Maher stated "count me in for Ted Cruz" if he has to choose between him and fellow GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday.  Maher said, "[I]f I have to choose between Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, count me in for Ted Cruz. Donald  —   you know, why? I mean, it would be horrible, but it wouldn’t be as unpredictably horrible as Donald Trump. Donald Trump, literally this week said the words, ‘All I know is what’s on the Internet.’ I’m not kidding.
