  Democrat turned Trump supporter Christian Rickers, the   executive director of the Trumpocrats PAC, told Breitbart’s Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle that "Hillary Clinton is not representing any of the working people. "["She’s not trustworthy on almost every single issue," Rickers said on Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM.  Rickers continued: "They are the architects of pretty much what has gutted out rural America and the rust Belt. They’re the reason the rust Belt is rusting. " The group plans a "barnstorming tour," which Rickers details in the full interview below. "We’re getting going with the TrumpocratPAC. com, and we’re going through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina to spread the message and supplement the efforts of the [Trump] campaign," he said.
