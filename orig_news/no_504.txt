Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • The U. S. Justice Department urged a federal appeals court to reinstate President Trump’s targeted travel ban, saying immediate action was needed to ensure the nation’s safety. Almost 100 U. S. companies  —   including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft  —   filed a legal brief arguing that the order is unconstitutional. President Trump’s confrontation with the courts may foreshadow years of legal battles, and in Congress   debates have turned into proxy battles over a combative president. Here’s what to watch for this week. _____ • Mr. Trump, who returned to Washington after military briefings in Florida, has rejected criticism. In a Twitter post, he said polls showing that a majority of Americans oppose his travel order were "fake. " In another, he bristled at suggestions that Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, holds the real power in the West Wing. But the chaos and shock waves at home and abroad appear to be prompting Mr. Trump and his top staff members to begin rethinking their improvisational approach to governing. _____ • A U. S. task force of influential China specialists, including former government officials and scholars, reports on two years of assessments of one of the world’s most important bilateral relationships.

Mr. Netanyahu was on his way back to Israel when the Knesset passed a provocative law retroactively legalizing Jewish settlements on privately owned Palestinian land  —   a measure almost certain to be nullified by the high court, but one that makes the ascendance of the country’s right wing inescapable. _____ • Remarkably good public health news: Researchers may have found the tools to stop cholera, the global pandemic that rose from the swamps of Bangladesh two centuries ago.

The Berlin International Film Festival opens this week with a tale of survival, that of one of the 20th century’s greatest jazz guitarists: Django Reinhardt. He was born in Belgium in 1910 to a Roma family that earned a living playing music from town to town. Reinhardt started off playing the banjo in Paris dance halls. At 18, he lost the use of two fingers on his left hand in a fire, and adapted with a new technique. He rose to fame in the ’30s. But with World War II and the Nazi occupation of France, Reinhardt tried to flee, fearing that, as a Roma and a jazz musician, he would be detained and killed. Instead, his fame  —   and the popularity of an officially discredited art form  —   may have saved him. "The Germans used Paris as the base for soldiers to rest and relax," said Michael Dregni, a Reinhardt biographer. "Jazz was the hot music of the time, so they all want to go out and see Jazz, and Django was the biggest star in Europe. " Reinhardt lived through the war, dying of a sudden stroke in 1953. His legacy lives on in the genre he helped create: Gypsy jazz. Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings. What would you like to see here?
