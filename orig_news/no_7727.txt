"As Home Secretary Mrs May oversaw the collapse in funding and support for the UK border force and I would have thought as a new prime minister hitting the ground running, making COBRA her first responsibility. "She should have used it to show her intention to get a grip of this crisis. Mr Hookem said he thought the criticism of the new Prime Minster over her twitter response was "shallow" saying, "What we need is actions not words. " "Mr Cameron may well have responded on twitter but what we really need is to have better border security and to raise the level of the alert.
