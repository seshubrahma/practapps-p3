Friday on CNN’s "New Day," Gov. Andrew Cuomo ( ) criticized Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) for his "New York values" attack on his rival Donald Trump.  Cruz added, "Not a lot of conservatives come out of New York. " "[N]ot only what he said is   York, it’s   I think it’s sad, disturbing for all Americans, not just for New York," Cuomo said. "He is practicing the politics of division. He’s trying to divide people. He’s trying to divide this country. It doesn’t work. In 30 seconds he offended gays, he offended women, he offend 18 million people and he offended one of the largest congressional delegations in this country. You can’t govern like that. You can’t win a campaign like that. He’s only getting worse and the discussion is only degenerating. " He added, "What he said  —   he was offensive to gays. I don’t believe this country is hostile to gays. I don’t believe it’s hostile to women. The concept of this country is, we accepted people from different religions, different countries and we made one, E Pluribus Unum  —   all in, we form one country, one nation. This is the opposite. I’m going to try to divide us one by one, pro choice from   women, straight people from gay people. It’s disturbing and it doesn’t work. This is why this country is gridlocked.
