Kasich says he will "have all the money we’ll need" after tonight’s results. Kasich says "this is the little engine that can" and says he’ll get into a covered wagon and hope for a breeze. He compares himself to Cinderella teams in March Madness.

Exit polls, per CNN: Majorities want to continue Obama’s policies —  except in Ohio.  —   Overall, majorities of Democratic voters in each state said they hoped the next president would continue President Barack Obama’s policies, with the exception of Ohio, where about half said they hoped to see Obama’s policies carried on.  —   About 1 in 5 voters in each state said they made up their minds in the final days of the campaign, about on par with the average of 17% across all states with exit or entrance polls so far. That dipped to 1 in 10 in Florida. 5:25: Exit polls: 71% of GOP primary voters would definitely or probably vote for Trump if he were the nominee. 75% of GOP primary would definitely or probably vote for Cruz if he were the nominee. 5:25: More exit polling: 57% of GOP primary voters would be satisfied with a Trump v. Clinton general election matchup. 5:23: GOP EXIT POLLS per CNN:   economy and jobs were the top issue in each state, except for Missouri where government spending ties the economy as the top concern.  —   Worry about the economy is widespread among this GOP electorate, with about 7 in 10 in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina saying they are very worried about the nation’s economic future. That dips to 6 in 10 in Ohio. Still, 1 in 5 or fewer in each of the five states voting today say they feel they personally are falling behind financially.  —   Majorities across three of the states voting today  —   Ohio, North Carolina and Illinois  —   said trade with other countries takes away U. S. jobs, while about a third in each of those states said it creates jobs.  —   Majorities of Republican voters across all five states today say they feel betrayed by the Republican Party, but not all were seeking someone from outside the establishment to carry the Party’s mantle. Majorities in Missouri and North Carolina said they wanted an outsider, as did about half in Florida and Illinois, and slightly less the half said so in Ohio.  —   Anger with the way the federal government is working is a bit more tempered here than it has been in other primary states. Between   and 4 in 10 GOP voters in each state said they were feeling angry about the way the government has been working. Across all other states with exit or entrance polls so far, an average of 42% described themselves as angry.  —   Majorities in all five states said they thought those working in the U. S. illegally ought to be allowed to apply for legal status, ranging from just over half in Missouri to nearly 6 in 10 in Florida.  —     or more say they support a temporary ban on allowing Muslims to enter the country, that finding holds across all states.  —   Overall, about 29% of voters across all states with GOP exit or entrance polls so far have said they made up their minds in the final days of the campaign. Across these states, the share saying they made a late decision ranges from about 15% in Florida to about a third in Illinois and Missouri.  —   Across all four states where it was asked, Trump has the lead as having run the most unfair campaign.  —   Demographically, today’s states present some variety. Not all have a heavy concentration of religious voters. White   or evangelical Christians made up just a third of GOP voters today in Florida  —   where almost as many voters were Catholic  —   but comprised 6 in 10 North Carolina voters.   5:17: Sanders flying to Arizona to hold Tuesday rally: . @BernieSanders readies to take off to Arizona on #BernForceOne. pic. twitter.   —   Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) March 15, 2016,  5:13: EXIT POLLS: Majority of voters across five Tuesday primary states feel BETRAYED by GOP: Good for Trump?

Chris Christie’s political future and his motivations for endorsing Donald Trump. "You guys can’t stop covering him," Clinton told Matthews. "He is a dangerous presence. " "It’s just like candy by the bushel. " Matthews followed up by acknowledging that his network has "progressive leanings, obviously. " "But nobody can tell what people want to watch," he said. "People must think they want to watch him," Clinton replied. "They laugh at him," said Matthews. The subject quickly turned to Christie, and Clinton wondered: "Why did he support him?" Matthews explained that Christie and others who support Trump "want a future" politically. "Did he have a debt?" Clinton mused. 1:00  —   From Breitbart’s Alex Swoyer: Kevin Bray, who is on the ground volunteering for GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, told Breitbart News he was asked to leave a polling location on Tuesday where he was passing out flyers. Bray was in Green County, Missouri at the James River Assembly of God where the public would cast votes on Super Tuesday. The County Clerk Shane Schoeller told Bray he had to leave the property since it was private property. Bray argued that he was 25 feet away from the door, obliging to the law, but that he shouldn’t have to leave if the premises is being used as a polling site. Breitbart News reached out to Schoeller for comment, but did not receive a response. Bray supplied Breitbart News with a photo and videos of the exchange.  12:58  —   WashPost: Trump is officially qualified to receive the nomination per RNC rules after his Marianas victory: See, in the Northern Marianas, Tuesday began 14 hours before it began on the East Coast. So its Super Threesday caucus was done overnight, and Trumpwon all nine delegates. In doing so, the Northern Marianas became the eighth state or territory in which Trump won a majority of the delegates. (The others: South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Hawaii and Mississippi.) And according to the rules of the Republican convention, a candidate must "demonstrate the support of a majority of the delegates from each of eight (8) or more states, severally, prior to the presentation of the name of that candidate for nomination. " No eight states, no nomination. 12:39  —   Kasich presser: he appears to blame Trump for the violent Chicago protests, also says video on Trump’s comments about women offended him.

But these aren’t normal times, and our man Trump is not a normal candidate. And the people supporting him are not to be found out there on the grassy expanses of Hamptons lawn parties. No, you are far more likely to find them, as I have, downtown in Sag Harbor at the LT or the Corner Bar. Trump’s people out here aren’t in the     outright racist 25 percent who responded to his early campaign dog whistles like Labradors in a duck blind. His Hamptonites are by and large male and   or older, and they work with their hands for a living: They run machines in the factory on the Turnpike, or they paint houses and they repair plumbing some of them work for the big landscaping companies that trim the Gin Lane hedges and mow Sagaponack lawns. They tend to occupy the next 25 percent, in other words  —   the people a suddenly gentler Trump is working to win over now, those who feel left out and left behind economically, whose thirst was supposed to be quenched by Reagan’s   economics but who have been waiting nearly forty years for the first drop to fall. Many of the people who hire Trump’s legions out here run hedge funds and investment banks and real estate investment trusts. Most are Republicans, very wealthy Republicans, and as we know, these Establishment Swells are not happy with Mr. Trump  —   a while back they dispatched a   poodle called Mitt Romney to warn everyone how dangerous he is. But the people who work for Establishment Swells in the Hamptons, they like Mr. Trump a lot. You want to know why? Because after decades of promises and kabuki economics, they’ve figured out that the only trickle that’s ever reached them has been from a busted pipe after a winter freeze at one of the Swells’ summer houses, when they were called in to clean up the mess. 12:17  —   Do re mi fa so la  …     I will bring our jobs back to the U.
