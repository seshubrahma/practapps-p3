In May, Trump released a list of possible justices he would use to fill the current vacancy due to Justice Scalia’s death in February. The initial list was described by Breitbart News legal editor Ken Klukowski as a "conservative goldmine. " ***UPDATE*** Judicial Crisis Network’s Carrie Severino says conservatives should be "very pleased" with the expanded list. "Donald Trump continues to take unprecedented steps to demonstrate that he intends to appoint justices like Scalia, Thomas and Alito," Severino says. "Conservatives should be very pleased by the steps he has taken, and if he lives up to his promises we will have a Court that truly puts the rule of law ahead of political preferences. " ***Update*** The Trump campaign officially announced the expanded list in a press release Thursday afternoon. Trump says: We have a very clear choice in this election. The freedoms we cherish and the constitutional values and principles our country was founded on are in jeopardy. The responsibility is greater than ever to protect and uphold these freedoms and I will appoint justices, who like Justice Scalia, will protect our liberty with the highest regard for the Constitution. This list is definitive and I will choose only from it in picking future Justices of the United States Supreme Court. I would like to thank the Federalist Society, The Heritage Foundation and the many other individuals who helped in composing this list of   highly respected people who are the kind of scholars that we need to preserve the very core of our country, and make it greater than ever before.
