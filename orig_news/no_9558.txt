Jeb Bush is mocking GOP rival Donald Trump for his decision to skip Thursday night’s debate in Iowa, and said he made a bet of $20 that the frontrunner will show up after all. ["I’ve got a $20 bet he shows up," Bush said during a town hall with Nationwide insurance employees, according to Politico. He added that Trump would show up "because it’s in his interest. "  "Poor little Donald," Bush ridiculed. "Barack Obama doesn’t go on Fox either, so now they have that in common. " Bush  —   once thought by establishment donors to be the Republican Party’s frontrunner  —   is struggling in the polls. He continued his mocking of Trump’s decision to skip the debate. Trump asserted Kelly had not treated him fairly in the first Fox News debate. "Really? He complains about not being treated fairly by the press? He consumes all the press," Bush said. "He’s a Stradivarius violinist in the Vienna symphony, man. I mean, the press is just being played like nobody’s business. "
