Rachael Bade writes in Politico.  Two prominent House allies of Paul Ryan broke with the speaker Friday over his decision to withhold support from Donald Trump, comments that point to a growing split among congressional Republicans over how to deal with the presumptive nominee. Reps. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia and Dennis Ross of Florida  —   who, as House whips, help Republican leaders muster support to pass legislation  —   told POLITICO in interviews on Friday that they disagreed with Ryan’s decision to break with Trump in a bombshell interview a day earlier. Both lawmakers said they believe their leader is in denial about how Republican voters feel about the   tycoon. "I honestly don’t understand what Paul’s thinking  —   I don’t get it," said Westmoreland, who is retiring after this year. "I try not to give advice to the speaker, but I think it just really brought about, in my opinion, even more confusion to this thing. " "Trust me, I haven’t been on the Donald Trump bandwagon, but I will support him, and I disagree with Ryan’s comment," Ross said. "I think it’s time we unite (and)   …     extend an olive branch and start working this out. " You can read the rest of the story here.
