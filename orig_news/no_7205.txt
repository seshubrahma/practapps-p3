Wednesday during a press conference Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told MSNBC’s Katy Tur to "be quiet" because he knows she wants "to save" his opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.  TUR: Do you have any qualms about asking a foreign government, Russia, China, anybody, to interfere, to hack into a system, of anybody’s email system. TRUMP: That’s up to the president. Let the president talk to them. Look here’s the problem, here’s the problem Katy  …     TUR: You said, ‘I welcome them to find those 30, 000 emails. TRUMP: Well they probably have them. I’d like to have them released. TUR: Does that not give you pause. TRUMP: No, it gives me no pause. If they have them, they have them, we might as well find them. Hey, you know what gives me more pause that a person in our government  crooked Hillary Clinton  —   be quiet. I know you want to save her  —   that a person in our government Katy would delete or get rid of 30, 000 emails. That gives me a big problem. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
