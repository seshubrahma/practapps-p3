’  ’ " a confidant of President Donald   Trump, told Business Insider in a Monday interview that Trump   should cut a deal with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   His proposition: Replace her on the bench with Judge Merrick   Garland, President Barack Obama’s choice to fill Justice Antonin   Scalia’s vacated seat in 2016. " ’   Ruddy,  to the   Senate’’s invoking the   nuclear option to help get Judge   Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court, said Trump   nominating Garland to the court would be a "huge move." ’ ’   "I think they made a big mistake by pulling the nuclear option,"   Ruddy said. "I wrote about it. I said they should not have done   it. I think that he still should pick Merrick Garland and do a   deal. Ruth Bader Ginsburg wants to retire, and I think they   should swap her out, give her an offer where they would put   Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court." ’ ’   "They would remove a very liberal Democrat with a moderate,   consensus Democrat, who I think Garland is," Ruddy added. "And I   think it would be a huge move and a sign for Trump that he’’s   willing to break through the political ice." ’ ’   Ruddy pointed to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is rumored to be   considering retirement from the court, as the next justice who   could feasibly be replaced by a more conservative, "    nominee." ’ "   The Newsmax CEO, who is also a member of Trump’s    club,    after the   president delivered his February address to a joint session of   Congress. Ruddy, who has known Trump for more than a decade, says   he speaks often with the president. " ’Chris Ruddy, a confidant of President Donald. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
