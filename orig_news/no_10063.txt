GOP frontrunner Donald Trump criticized Republicans for caving to President Obama’s demands at almost every opportunity, saying he thinks Republicans may already be planning to nominate Obama’s pick to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. [Appearing on Breitbart News Daily with Breitbart News executive chairman and host Stephen K. Bannon, Trump slammed last year’s massive budget deal "that Republicans approved in what, 15 seconds?"  "I always say Obama’s a lousy negotiator except when it comes to negotiating with Republicans. Did you ever see anything like it? He just makes deal after deal," Trump said. "That’s why I’m even concerned about the judgeship. You look at the Supreme Court judge  —   at first, you heard the Senate was absolutely ‘we will not do it.’ Yesterday, I started hearing, ‘Well, there could be a way.’ The Republicans are already weakening. " Asked whether this is a tell that Republicans will confirm Obama’s choice of a Supreme Court justice, Trump said: "I don’t know. I’ve watched it so many times now when the Republicans are going to be so strong, and all of a sudden, they’re absolutely weak  …     They have all of the leverage on their side, and yesterday they’re saying something good happened. And then I said, ‘Here we go again.’ It’s unbelievable. " Should the   Senate approve of Obama’s nominee, Obama will have nominated a full third of Supreme Court.
