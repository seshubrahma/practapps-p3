’  ’ ’   Delta Air Lines has barred a passenger who went on an     rant in support of   Donald Trump   on Flight 248 from Atlanta to Allentown, Pennsylvania, on   November 22. ’ ’   "This individual displayed behavior that was loud, rude and   disrespectful to his fellow customers," Delta CEO Ed Bastian   wrote in a memo to employees. "He will never again be allowed on   a Delta plane." ’ ’   In addition, Bastian said Delta will refund the tickets for   passengers on the flight. ’ ’   A  which shows a passenger   standing in the aisle of the aircraft hurling expletives at his   fellow passengers, has been making its way around the internet   over the past few days. ’ ’   Delta was criticized in the immediate aftermath of the incident   for failing to remove the disruptive passenger from the flight. ’ ’’ ’   However, Delta later issued an apology: ’ ’   In the memo, Bastian agreed that the passenger should have been   removed from the flight. ’ ’   Delta Air Lines declined to comment when asked by Business   Insider whether barring the passenger was an overreaction to the   incident. ’
