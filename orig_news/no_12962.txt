Sunday on NBC’s "Meet The Press,"   Donald Trump’s incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus got into a long, heated exchange with show moderator Chuck Todd over reports that the CIA has concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.  After insisting the RNC was not hacked, Priebus said to a combative Todd, "I don’t know why you are so hot about this. " Todd shot back, "It’s not about me. " Later in the exchange Todd said, "Do you believe  —   let’s clear this up. do you believe  —   does the   believe that Russia was trying to muddy up and get involved in the election in 2016?" Priebus said, "Number one, you don’t know it. I don’t know it. There’s been no conclusive or specific report to say otherwise. " Todd asked, "Do you dispute 17 intelligence agencies that have assessed that Russia agents were behind this? You dispute this? Priebus said, "Chuck, this is insane. In the same article about the 17 agencies, it said it was inconclusive. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
