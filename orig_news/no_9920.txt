Monday, former NFL star Jim Brown appeared on ESPN’s "SportsCenter," and the Cleveland legend was asked to explain his previous comments where he said that things will eventually work out for the better now that Donald Trump has been elected as President Barack Obama’s successor.  Brown, who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, said Trump will either "shake things up the right way" or "shake things up the wrong way," which would lead to a resistance. He added that he is "pulling for" Trump, and he knows the   will "be for all the people. " Transcript as follows:  I think that things are being shaken up. I think that people are being provoked to come out with their real feelings. I think that it looks negative a great degree, but I think that any time you put a person in a position of responsibility that their good side can come out. So, Donald is going to either be a great leader and shake things up the right way, or he’s going to shake things up the wrong way and that’s going to make the great people come out and resist it. So, it’s just not going to be neutral. It’s not going to lay dead. It’s going to be very provocative and I’m hoping it will be provocative in a very positive way. So, I’m pulling for the president. He is the president, and I know that he is going to be for all the people and I hope that that bravado that he presents becomes a positive energy so that we could all get behind doing the right thing.
