Thursday on Fox Business Network’s Republican Presidential Debate, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addressed Gov. Nikki Haley ( ) urging Republicans to resist the temptation to follow the "siren call of the angriest voices" in her GOP response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address on Tuesday.  "OK, first of all Nikki, this afternoon said I’m a friend of hers," he said. "Actually a close friend. Wherever you are sitting Nikki, I’m a friend. We’re friends. That’s good. She did say there was anger. I’m very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster. Our health care is horror show. ObamaCare  —   we’re going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry. And I won’t be angry when we fix it but until we fix it, I’m very, very angry. I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasn’t offended. She said the truth. One of your colleagues interviewed me. And said, well, she said you were angry. I said to myself, huh, she’s right. I’m not fighting that. I didn’t find it offensive at all. I’m angry because our country is a mess. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
