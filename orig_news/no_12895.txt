Sunday on CBS’s "Face the Nation," former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said he has "real issues" with presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s positions on national security.  Gates said, "Well, I have some real issues with things he said about national security policy and some concerns. I think there’s some contradictions. You can’t have a trade war with China then turn around ask them to help you on North Korea. I have no idea what his policy would be in terms of dealing with ISIS. I worry a little bit about his admiration for Vladimir Putin. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
