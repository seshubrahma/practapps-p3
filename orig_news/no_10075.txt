.@tomfriedman on Trump pick for ambassador to Israel: This is such madness. https:  .  https:  .  Friday on CNN’s "New Day," New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman criticized   Donald Trump’s pick for U. S. ambassador to Israel David Friedman.  Among the complaints Thomas Friedman had about the pick was David Friedman support of moving the U. S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Such a gesture would upset many of the actors in the Middle East according to Thomas Friedman. "The issue is we continue  —   the United States position is that the ultimate disposition of Jerusalem remains to be negotiated by the two sides," Friedman said. "And until it is, we’re going to keep our embassy in Tel Aviv. Now, moving the American embassy  —   this is an evergreen. Everyone running for president tosses this out. No one actually does it. Moving the American embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in the absence of an agreed upon solution between Israelis and Palestinians, I would call that ‘the full employment for Iran act’ because I can tell you, Chris, the Iranians, they would be clinking glasses over that. " "What the Iranians would then do is make a huge issue of this," he continued. "Paint the Americans as a   basically fanatical   supporter of the worst kind in Israel. And that would then embarrass all the Sunni Arab regimes. They would have to do something further complicating Israel’s relations with them and also with their relations with us. This would put Egypt and Saudi Arabia in a very awkward position. I can tell you the Iranians right now. I mean, they would be sending love letters to David Friedman. " "It’s just madness," he added. "I can’t believe we’re talking about this. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
