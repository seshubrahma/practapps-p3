North Dakota’s sole Congressman, Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer ( ) derided presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who have recently suggested that Donald Trump should be blamed for violent protesters at his own campaign rallies. ["For the three elected Republicans to blame Trump for violence committed by liberal Chicago thugs is like Barack Obama blaming U. S. exceptionalism for radical Islamic terrorism," Cramer wrote in a new  .  After Trump’s Chicago campaign rally on Friday was canceled because of large protests, fellow GOP candidates criticized Trump rather than the left wing protesters. "I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment, when the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence  —   to punch people in the face. The predictable consequence of that is that it escalates and today is unlikely to be the last such instance. We [saw] earlier today in St. Louis over thirty arrested. That’s not how our politics should occur," Cruz stated in response to the protests. Rubio simply said, "Words have consequences. " Kasich also cast some blame on Trump’s "gloomy" tone, according to The Hill. "You can walk into a room of 100 people, and you can put them in a really bad mood or you can make them hopeful," Kasich said. "I talk about how we can fix things. The hopefulness of things, I think, works. "
