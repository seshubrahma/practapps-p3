On Friday’s broadcast of "PBS NewsHour," New York Times columnist David Brooks stated that the way in which presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s campaign announced the VP selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence (R) shows "this is not a real campaign. "  Brooks said, "Well, this is not a real campaign. Like, there’s a certain norm of the way things are done. Usually, when you announce your vice presidential candidate, there’s like a professional rollout. Like, you do trivial things like updating your Web page, which the Trump campaign didn’t do for a little while. And so they’re just  —   it’s a   show. And one gets the impression everyone else around is sort of in the dark, and Trump’s deciding or not deciding. And, as a result, the normal institutional presence that a campaign has, where decisions get made, and things get done, and conventions get organized, a lot of that, it’s unclear if that’s happening.
