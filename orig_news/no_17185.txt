"Melania Trump, a former model, is "Muse. "Pence, the head of the Hoosier State, is "Hoosier. "Karen Pence, the governor’s wife, is "Hummingbird." Meanwhile, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is no stranger to the Secret Service. Clinton has had a Secret Service detail    and will for life    since her husband won the presidency.  Hillary Clinton, a fixture in US politics, is "Evergreen. "Former President Bill Clinton, her husband, is "Eagle." (CNN does not yet know the codename for her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine).
