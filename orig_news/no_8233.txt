Wednesday on "CBS This Morning," former "Face the Nation" host Bob Schieffer speculated on what could happen at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer if GOP presidential   Donald Trump doesn’t secure a majority of the delegates at the end of the primary process.  Schieffer explained to   Charlie Rose and Gayle King that if Trump isn’t selected on the first ballot, he anticipates the delegates could select House Speaker Paul Ryan as this year’s GOP nominee. "All that makes it a possibility is all that says is that they can block Trump getting the majority of delegates before they get to the convention," Schieffer said. "If they get to the convention, it doesn’t make any difference who has how many delegates. If Trump doesn’t get it on the first ballot, then anything could happen. I mean, I think  —   if you want to know what I think. Off the top of my head, I think Paul Ryan will wind up as the nominee if they get it to the convention. " Schieffer went on to add that Ryan could select current Republican presidential candidate Gov. John Kasich ( ) to be his running mate, which would give him an edge in the state of Ohio. "I would bet that what would happen if you had Paul Ryan as the nominee, he would put John Kasich on the ticket as the vice president," he added. "No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio and one of the most stunning things that came up last night in our exit polling, 30 percent of the Republicans in Ohio would not vote for Donald Trump if he is the nominee and 41 percent said they would consider another party, that is Ohio where they said that.
