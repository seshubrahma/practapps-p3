Sunday at Miss Katie’s Diner in Milwaukee, WI, Republican presidential   Donald Trump said his opponent Gov. John Kasich ( ) "should not be allowed to run. "  Trump said, "Kasich should be allowed to continue and the RNC shouldn’t allow him to continue. And Kasich has more of an impact on me than he does on Cruz in my opinion. " He continued, "I mentioned it to the RNC. I said, ‘Why is a guy allowed to run?’ All he doing is he goes from place to place and loses and he keeps running.  Well why doesn’t Marco Rubio do that? Why doesn’t Jeb Bush do that? Why didn’t all of them do that after it was their time. Now if he wants to go and have his name put in nomination in the convention he can do that. He doesn’t have to run and take my votes because he is taking my votes. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
