Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s wife, Melania Trump, defended him during a recent interview, saying, "He’s not Hitler. "["We know the truth. He’s not Hitler. He wants to help America. He wants to unite people," the former supermodel stated during an interview with DuJour magazine, which was published on Tuesday. She was asked about comments that her husband "is Hitler. "  She also said that her husband’s proposal to ban Muslims was "temporary," noting he "needs to say it in a softer way. " "He doesn’t go after religions. He feels like we need to know who’s coming to this country. If not, we don’t have a country," she explained. "That’s how he feels. We see how he is, and he wants to unite the country and bring people together and bring jobs back. "
