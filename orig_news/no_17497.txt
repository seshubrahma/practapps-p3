Washington (CNN) Carly Fiorina, the former   executive running for president, and her husband are worth $59 million, according to financial disclosure her campaign released Wednesday. The Fiorinas were taxed at an effective rate of 30% in 2012 and 2013, the two years of tax returns Fiorina released. The Fiorinas also donated 14% of their income on average in those two years, according to the campaign. The Republican presidential candidate disclosed her income and assets as required by the Federal Election Commission and her campaign also provided additional details on Fiorina’s finances as part of the campaign’s continued bid to appear forthright and transparent. Fiorina, the only female candidate in the GOP 2016 field, has emphasized transparency and a willingness to take questions as she looks to starkly contrast Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic presidential candidate who has taken few questions since announcing her bid. "I’ve taken hundreds of questions    whether about hot dogs or my personal finances    and I think it’s all fair game," Fiorina said in a statement accompanying her financial disclosures. "I think leadership of any kind requires trust and transparency and voters should demand no less from their political leadership in government." Election 2016: Who are the richest candidates? The Fiorinas’ $59 million net worth may be   to most Americans, but she wouldn’t be the wealthiest GOP nominee. Mitt Romney, the party’s nominee in 2012, was worth about $250 million when he ran for president. Fiorina’s millions make her among the wealthiest candidates, but she wouldn’t necessarily be the wealthiest as billionaire Donald Trump, who has repeatedly teased a presidential bid, is set to announce his own 2016 plans this month.
