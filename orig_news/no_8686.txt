HOLLIS, New Hampshire  —   Ivanka Trump told a room full of supporters in New Hampshire that the most positive and encouraging experience she has had while campaigning for her father is learning how many people across the country love America despite all the negativity involved in politics, adding that it’s the people that motivate her father.

Everyone is so busy being pulled in 1, 000 directions, but first and foremost, you care about this country and each other and we want what’s right and what’s best. So, for all of the negatively that exist  —   and there’s a lot  —   politics is a rough business, real estate on a relative basis  …    real estate people are not babies  —   but this is tough relative to that. "But in spite of all of that, I think the passion, the hope, the optimism, the excitement that I hear from so many people that I hear in the potential of a Trump presidency is deeply inspiring and it’s very exciting and I know for my father, that’s the fuel for him that keeps him going. It’s the people," she added. Spotted quite a few of these large @realDonaldTrump signs in Hollis, #newhampshire today @BreitbartNews pic. twitter.   —   Alex Swoyer, esq.
