Nigel Farage, former leader of Great Britain’s UK Independence Party (UKIP) and the figurehead of the "Brexit" movement’s upset victory, appeared at a Donald Trump campaign rally in Jackson, Mississippi Wednesday night, encouraging the crowd to fight the American political establishment like the people of Britain did just months ago.   Farage framed the current political election as a fight between "ordinary, decent people" and powerful globalist institutions. "If the little people, if the real people, if the ordinary, decent people are prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in, we can overcome the big banks, we can overcome the multinationals," he declared after an introduction from Trump. He recounted how polls, financial agencies, and the majority of European institutions predicted Brexit’s failure even on the day of the country’s referendum on European Union membership. Farage recalled that ordinary people in the UK reacted poorly when U. S. President Barack Obama came to their country and participated in "Project Fear," telling them not to vote "Exit. " He said that as a foreign citizen, he would commit the same sin by telling Americans how they should vote. However, he quipped, "If I were an American citizen, I wouldn’t vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me  —   in fact, I wouldn’t vote for Hillary Clinton if she paid me. " At the end of his brief remarks, Farage encouraged the rally attendees, declaring, "Anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment. "
