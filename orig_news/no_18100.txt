â€™  â€™ â€™   In an unusually blunt interview, veteran journalist Ted Koppel   told Fox News commentator Sean Hannity that heâ€™â€™s "bad for   America" on Sunday. â€™ â€™   The pair were discussing the state of American media on "CBS   Sunday Morning" when Hannity, the conservative firebrand and   staunch supporter of President Donald Trump who has been accused   of blurring news and opinion, defended his style of journalism. â€™ â€™   "We have to give some credit to the American people that theyâ€™â€™re   somewhat intelligent and that they know the difference between an   opinion show and a news show," Hannity said. â€™ â€™   "Youâ€™â€™re cynical," he added to the   Koppel, to which   the host agreed. â€™ â€™   Hannity pressed further: "Do you think weâ€™re bad for America? You   think Iâ€™m bad for America?" â€™ â€™   "Yeah," Koppel replied flatly. â€™ â€™   In the testy    that followed, Koppel laid out   his chief complaint. â€™ â€™   "You have attracted people who are determined that ideology is   more important than facts."  â€™ â€™   After the segment aired, Hannity slammed CBS as "fake edited   news." â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t"Fake Edited News"   release the Unedited 45 minute interview so people can see the BS games you play in the edit room.
