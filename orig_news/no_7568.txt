GREENVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA —  Rep. Mark Sanford ( ) the former governor of South Carolina, has endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) as his choice to become the next President of the United States. [Sanford remains a very popular figure in the Palmetto State, and his endorsement could draw enough support for the Texas Senator to make him a contender for a top spot in Saturday’s South Carolina Republican Primary.  "What struck me about Ted is the fact that you’ve come out against those ethanol subsidies, I fought against spending my entire time in politics and all too few people will," Sanford said during a rally in Charleston Friday. "We need another fighter in Washington. " The former South Carolina Governor said he wasn’t planning  to endorse anyone but got involved in the fight after Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) and Donald Trump labeled Sen. Cruz a liar. "It just struck me that it’s gotten out of bounds," he told the crowd. Sanford accompanied Cruz aboard the USS Yorktown earlier this week, where the Republican candidate for President introduced his plan to revamp America’s military. The former governor resigned his seat following a sex scandal but has rebuilt and redeemed his image with South Carolina voters, having won a seat in the U. S. Congress in 2013.
