Republican nominee Donald Trump says he’ll unveil his plan to revitalize the U. S. economy on Monday afternoon at the Detroit Economic Club. [His plan aims to help everyone gain economically and he will "focus on empowering Americans," according to his press release.  The press release adds that the New Yorker’s economic plan "will stand in stark contrast to Clinton’s same, stale big government policy prescriptions that have choked economic growth in America and led to over 40 years of wage stagnation. Americans will have two choices presented to them this November, to stay on the same path that has cost Americans millions of jobs, and declining incomes, or change that can finally allow Americans to reach their potential and become great again. " Trump also revealed members of his economic advisory team who, he says, will help Trump create jobs and assist with "fixing the Obama Administration’s economic failures of the last eight years. " Members of the economic advisory team include: Steve Roth, Harold Hamm, Howard Lorber, Steven Mnuchin, Tom Barrack, Stephen M. Calk, John Paulson, Andy Beal, and Steve Feinberg. Additionally, the team includes highly respected advisers David Malpass, Peter Navarro, Stephen Moore and Dan DiMicco. The campaign’s policy team will be led by National Director of Policy, Stephen Miller, and Deputy Director, Dan Kowalski. "I am pleased that we have such a formidable group of experienced and talented individuals that will work with me to implement real solutions for the economic issues facing our country," Trump states in the press release on Friday. For too long we have watched as President Obama and Hillary Clinton have ruined our economy and decimated the middle class. I am going to be the greatest jobs President our country has ever seen. We will do more for the hardworking people of our country and Make America Great Again.
