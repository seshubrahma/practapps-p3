During the Sunday broadcast of New York AM 970 radio’s "The Cats Roundtable," former New York City Democratic Mayoral Candidate Andrew Stein endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, reasoning he was going to "shake things up in Washington. "  "I think the country’s in trouble. Our economic growth is too slow. Our military is being decimated by Obama’s cuts," Stein told host John Catsimatidis. "Our support for Israel has not been strong. Donald Trump understands all of this. I think he’ll be a strong leader. He understands that America has to be great again. He’ll cut taxes like JFK and Reagan did and stimulate the economy. " Stein later added, "He’s a real doer. Hillary exemplifies the status quo. " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
