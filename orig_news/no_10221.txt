Without offering a reason, Democratic   nominee Tim Kaine cancelled an event that was scheduled for Friday at 6 p. m. at Sarasota, FL’s Municipal Auditorium. [Although the event is still listed on the Hillary Clinton’s campaign website, the page reads, "This event has been cancelled. Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience. "  The cancellation comes at a time when both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are making aggressive pushes in the Sunshine State to win the state’s 29 electoral votes. Trump earlier this week wrapped a   swing through Florida and Clinton on Wednesday wrapped up a   trip. Kaine’s scheduled visit to Tallahassee, FL at Florida State University in the northern part of the state on Friday still appears to be on. Earlier in the week, Kaine hosted an event in West Palm Beach, FL that drew a very small crowd. That may or may not be the reason for the campaign’s decision not to hold the previously scheduled Sarasota event. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
