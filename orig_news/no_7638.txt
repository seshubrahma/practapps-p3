"The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania’s speech than the FBI spent on Hillary’s emails," Trump tweeted.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2016,  On Wednesday, Meredith McIver, an   staff writer at the Trump Organization, issued a statement taking responsibility for drafting Mrs. Trump’s speech, which included the passage inadvertently copied from Michelle Obama. McIver wrote, "Yesterday, I offered my resignation to Mr. Trump and the Trump family, but they rejected it. Mr. Trump told me that people make innocent mistakes and that we learn and grow from these experiences. " McIver explained how the cribbed passage ended up in the speech: In working with Melania Trump on her recent First Lady speech, we discussed many people who inspired her and messages she wanted to share with the American people. A person she has always liked is Michelle Obama. Over the phone, she read me some passages from Mrs. Obama’s speech as examples. I wrote them down and alter included some of the phrasing in the draft that ultimately became the final speech. I did not check Mrs. Obama’s speeches. This was my mistake, and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps, as well as to Mrs. Obama. No harm was meant.
