Friday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," while discussing President Donald Trump’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn working as a foreign agent during the presidential campaign,   Mika Brzezinski said declared the Trump presidency as having "no credibility where we stand right now. "  Brzezinski said, "It’s staggering   …     They have made a joke of the entire transition process, and this presidency has no credibility where we stand right now. I don’t say that with hysteria. I don’t say that with shrillness. I say that with a deep sense of concern for how we often cover this story because there are people who believe Trump from start to finish and he’s not telling the truth.
