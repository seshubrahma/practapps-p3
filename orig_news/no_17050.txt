Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump’s campaign adviser said Saturday that his decision on who will serve as his chief of staff is "imminent." Kellyanne Conway did not provide further details on timing in speaking to reporters at Trump Tower in Manhattan. She mentioned Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus was interested in the job, but said there are "several people being considered" and that it was "Mr. Trump’s decision ultimately." Sources have told CNN Priebus is considered to be the   for the job. But Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon, a close confidante of Trump’s, is also in the running. Sources told CNN Friday that an announcement could come as early as Monday. When asked Saturday when Trump’s next public event will be, Conway said "in the next couple of days." House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have urged Trump to pick Priebus, telling Trump they believed the RNC chairman is the right choice and the best fit for the position, a source told CNN on Friday. Trump’s    and trusted adviser, Jared Kushner, has also said privately he is supportive of Priebus. While Priebus is more tied to the Washington establishment, Bannon is said to be the more controversial choice, As the head of Brietbart News, Bannon is seen as the face of the   movement that helped propel Trump to the presidency and was behind some of Trump’s most controversial moments on the campaign trail. However, he has gained the trust of Trump and been a constant figure on the campaign since he joined the team in August. When asked if she will serve in the administration, Conway said she would "love to serve" and was discussing it with Trump.
