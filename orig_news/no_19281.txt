’  ’ "   A  released on Monday showed Donald Trump   trailing Hillary Clinton by five points, but it’s still some   of the best polling news he’s received in weeks as his   campaign recovers from scandals that have rocked his candidacy. " ’   The Republican presidential nominee has been down in the polls   since early this month when  that captured Trump on a hot mic   making lewd comments about women. ’ ’ have put Clinton ahead by high margins   in recent weeks. An ABC News tracking poll conducted last week   put Clinton up by 12 points, a Quinnipiac poll put Clinton up by   six, and a Fox News poll put Clinton up by nine. A Los Angeles   Times poll, which has generally favored Trump throughout the   election cycle, put Clinton up by one point. ’ ’   In the CNN poll, conducted at the end of last week, Clinton led   Trump 49% to 44% in a   race that included Libertarian   candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. The   margin of error for the poll was 3. 5 points. ’ ’   The poll put Trump within striking distance of Clinton with   just over two weeks left in the election. ’ ’’ ’   Trump also appeared to have consolidated support from the   Republican base, for the most part. In the CNN poll, 90% of   Republican respondents said they were voting for Trump. He was   also leading among independent voters, 45% of whom said they were   voting for Trump, compared to 41% who said they were supporting   Clinton. ’ ’   Still, Trump has a ways to go to ensure a victory on Election   Day. Clinton has had an advantage over him in the polls for most   of this election cycle, and additional women have been coming   forward this month . ’
