Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld says GOP frontrunner Donald Trump "touched a nerve" with Americans, adding, "It’s just amazing. "["This election year is so different from most of, if not all, of the earlier ones that I’ve experienced," Rumsfeld said on NBC News’s Today Show, adding that the real estate mogul "has caused people to respond in a way that most politicians have not been able to do. "  "I see someone who has touched a nerve with our country," he explained. Rumsfeld said voters are hungry for alternatives to politicians  —   both seen from Trump’s support and with support for Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ). "That fact that Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are able to draw       or   people to hear them speak say that there’s something going on in our country that they’re appealing to in a very interesting, unusual way," Rumsfeld added.
