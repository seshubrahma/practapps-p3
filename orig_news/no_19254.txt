’  ’ "   A Democratic operative distanced himself from the Democratic   National Committee on Tuesday and another operative was fired   from a progressive organization, following the release of a     from controversial   conservative activist James O’Keefe. " "   The two videos, released on Monday and Tuesday, appeared to show   Democratic operatives discussing how they paid people to incite   violence at Republican nominee Donald Trump’s rallies, among   other claims. " "   Democratic organizations said the activities discussed in the   videos do not appear to have ever taken place and were   investigating the practices of O’Keefe, who has been criticized   in the past for selectively editing videos to create false   accusations. " "   One man in the videos, Scott Foval, the national field   director of Americans United for Change, a progressive     organization, was heard discussing how he helped get protesters   to stir up violence at Trump’s events. " ’   "I mean honestly, it is not hard to get some of these         to   pop off," he said of Trump supporters in the undercover video.   "It’s a matter of showing up, to want to get into the rally, in a   Planned Parenthood  . Or, ’’Trump is a Nazi,’’ you know." ’ ’   "You can message to draw them out, and draw them to punch you,"   Foval continued. "The whole point is that we know Trump’s   people will freak the     out, his security team will freak out,   and his supporters will lose their    ." ’ ’   Foval said that if an individual were to protest at a   Trump rally, he or she would likely be "attacked." ’ ’   "That’s what we want," he said. "We have to be really   careful because, because what we don’t need is for it to show up   on CNN that the DNC paid for X people to [attend] that’s   not going to happen. " ’ ’  ’ ’   Foval said in the video that he’’s paid "mentally ill" and   "homeless" people to "do some crazy stuff before."  ’ ’   "I’ve also taken them for dinner, and I’ve also made sure they   had a hotel, and a shower," he said. "And I put them in a   program. Like, I’ve done that." ’ "   Neither Foval nor Americans United for Change responded   to multiple requests for comment on Tuesday, but CNN   reported Foval had been fired. In a statement to Fox News, Brad   Woodhouse, the organization’s president, said the   operative was no longer with the organization. " ’   "Americans United For Change has always operated according to the   highest ethical and legal standard," .   "Scott Foval is no longer associated with Americans United for   Change."  ’ ’   Also shown in the videos was Bob Creamer. He ran the group   Democracy Partners, which contracted Foval. Creamer is also   the husband of Democratic Rep. Jan Shakowsky of   Illinois.  ’ ’   "And the Democratic Party apparatus and the people from the   campaign, the Clinton campaign and my role with the campaign, is   to manage all that," Creamer said to an undercover reporter in a   video. "Wherever Trump and [Mike] Pence are gonna be, we have   events." ’ "   In addition, two of Creamer’s staffers, Aaron Black and Zulema   Rodriguez, were seen on video claiming credit for   coordinating protests outside of a . Trump had to cancel the event. " "   In a Tuesday statement, provided to Business Insider by O’Keefe’s   group, Project Veritas, Creamer said he was stepping aside   from his work with the DNC. " ’   "I am unwilling to become a distraction to the important task of   electing Hillary Clinton, and defeating Donald Trump in the   upcoming election," he wrote. He added he was "enormously   proud of the work we have done over the last months to sound the   alarm about the danger Donald Trump would present to American   democracy." ’ ’   "Contrary to the outrageous claims of the notorious right wing   blogger James O’Keefe, we have always adhered to the highest   standards of transparency and legality in our work for the DNC,"   Creamer continued. "Democracy Partners regards our nation’’s   election laws and the integrity of our democratic institutions   with utmost seriousness. And we have only   in legal   and nonviolent methods to demonstrate how Donald Trump is unfit   to be President." ’ ’   Creamer said that he regretted the "unprofessional and   careless hypothetical conversations that were captured on hidden   cameras of a temporary regional contractor [Foval] for our firm." ’ ’   "While, none of the schemes described in the conversations ever   took place, these conversations do not at all reflect the values   of Democracy Partners," he said. "James O’Keefe, the discredited   individual behind this   spying scheme directed   at our firm uses methods that would make Richard Nixon and the   Watergate burglars proud." ’ ’   Creamer lambasted O’’Keefe for using false identifications,   disguises, and "elaborate false covers" to infiltrate his and   other firms. ’ ’   "Those of us who are involved in political work because we   believe deeply in progressive values are saddened that those on   the right are using dirty tricks in order to pursue their   political agenda rather than engage in an honest debate about   ideas," he said. "I will not aid Mr. O’Keefe’s despicable efforts   to distract from the critical choice American voters face   November 8th." ’ ’   Of note, the Chicago rally prominently featured in the film   occurred months before Creamer was contracted by the DNC. ’ "   DNC interim chair Donna Brazile provided a statement to Business   Insider on Tuesday evening, condemning the remarks made by   Foval in the videos, while simultaneously   criticizing O’Keefe. " ’   "The practices described in the video by this temporary regional     do not in any way comport with our long standing   policies on organizing events, and those statements and   sentiments do not represent the values that the Committee holds   dear," she said. "We do not believe, or have any evidence to   suggest, that the activities articulated in the video actually   occurred." ’ ’   "The discredited source of these videos, James O’Keefe, is a   convicted criminal with a history of doctoring video to advance   his ideological agenda,"  continued. "We are   in the process of conducting an internal investigation to   determine whether he and his cohorts committed any illegal   activities in this   operation. We know this campaign   will be won on the issues and solutions offered by the candidates   and Hillary Clinton is the only person in this race with the   experience and steadiness to bring people together and get real   results." ’ ’  ’ "   O’Keefe has a history of publishing similar undercover videos,   but he has gotten into hot water for his practices. In 2010,   he  for posing as   a phone repairman to enter   Sen. Mary Landrieu’s   New Orleans office. In 2013, he settled a suit for   $100, 000 after editing a recording with an ACORN employee who   later lost his job. " ’ has also been   found to contain  to show an intended   narrative, as the conservative website TheBlaze wrote. ’ ’   Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas  Tuesday afternoon,   saying it showed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary   Clinton’’s "corruption" and "criminality . .. runs deep." ’ "   In an interview with conservative radio host Mike Gallagher,   Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump   praised O’Keefe. " ’   "He’’s done some very good work and I’’ll tell you what, it was   disgraceful to see that," . "No, it’’s a very   unfair system. I’’m telling you the election is rigged."  ’ "   During a rally in Colorado later Tuesday, Trump appeared to   address the O’Keefe footage when his event was disrupted by a   protester. " ’   "So yesterday, there was a story that the DNC, Democratic   National Committee, is sending protesters in here,"   Trump said. "[Y]ou know it’s disgusting." ’
