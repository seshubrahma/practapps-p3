Outgoing President Obama refused to condemn the disruptive demonstrations erupting across the country against   Donald Trump and the violent attacks on his supporters. ["I would not advise people who feel strongly or are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised over the course of the campaign, I would not advise them to be silent," he said Thursday.  "I’ve been the subject of protests during the course of my eight years. And I suspect that there’s not a president in our history that hasn’t been subject to these protests," he added. Rioters across the country smashed windows, vandalized cars, set fires, torched American flags, attacked police officers, shut down major freeways, looted businesses, and more after Trump’s decisive electoral victory.   rioters have also violently attacked Americans —  some in what appear to be   assaults —  who voted for the Republican presidential nominee.
