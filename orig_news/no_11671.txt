"Ronna has been a committed leader in our Party for years, and her leadership this cycle in helping   Trump turn Michigan red for the first time since 1988 makes her an exceptional choice to serve as Deputy Chair," Priebus said.

"Bob has a proven ability to be a team player, knows how to achieve results at the ballot box, and has a keen focus on furthering the RNC’s commitment to winning," he said. We are proud to have him take on a new leadership role where he can help implement   Trump’s and our Republican majority’s vision for change.
