Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) said last week that she supports a filibuster to stop the Supreme Court nomination of federal Judge Neil Gorsuch, claiming that he is "way outside the mainstream. "["We need to have a judge who’s kind of acceptable to both sides," Warren said on National Public Radio’s Morning Edition Friday. "That’s the reason there’s a   rule in effect on Supreme Court nominees. "  "I don’t think Neil Gorsuch meets that standard," Warren said. "Here’s someone  —   read his record. " "In every opportunity to choose between corporate interests, big corporations and the little guy  —   employees, women, consumers  —   he always chooses the big corporations," Warren said. "And I think that puts him way outside the mainstream of what we need. " "So that means you  —    just to be clear  —   you would support a filibuster?" Host Rachel Martin asked Warren. "Oh, absolutely," Warren said. Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) told Politico on Thursday that the Democrats would deny Gorsuch the 60 votes he needs to avoid a Senate filibuster and be confirmed to the High Court. "There’s been an almost seismic shift in the caucus [against Gorsuch]," Schumer said as the Senate Judiciary confirmation hearings concluded on Thursday. "He did not win anybody over with his testimony. " A Democratic filibuster would leave it up to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) whether or not to change Senate rules requiring a   confirmation to a simple majority vote on the nominee. President Donald Trump has expressed support for changing the rules or employing what some refer to as the "nuclear option. " "If we end up with that gridlock I would say if you can, Mitch, go nuclear," Trump said, as reported by CNN. "That would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web. " "It’s up to Mitch, but I would say go for it," Trump said.
