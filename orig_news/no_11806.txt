Breitbart News’ live updates on the 2016 presidential election. This afternoon, Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation over leaked emails showing she was hostile to Bernie Sanders during the close primary between him and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton. Wasserman Schultz’s resignation comes one day before the party begins its national convention in Philadelphia.  UPDATE 11:33 P. M. ET, Forthcoming interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile tells her current employer CNN that she wants to "learn" more about all of this. Interim DNC chair, Donna Brazile: "I want to learn what is behind all of this, because more emails are coming." https:  .   —   Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) July 25, 2016,  Brazile may want to start with the emails in which she called Sanders’ team "stupid" and their ideas "lunacy. " UPDATE 11:20 P. M. ET, Wow. #DNCLeak: Trump may be right about Ted Cruz’s father  JFK kill   —   Comms head Luis Miranda https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 23, 2016,    UPDATE 10:25 P. M. ET, Hillary Clinton, in an interview with 60 Minutes, says: "I don’t know anything about these emails. I haven’t followed it. But I’m very proud of the campaign I ran. And I’m very proud of the campaign that Sen. Sanders ran. " When asked by 60 minutes if it would have been "improper" for anyone inside the DNC to favor one candidate over another, Hillary Clinton responds: "Again, I don’t have any information about this. So I can’t answer specifically. We ran our campaign. We ran hard. We worked to have as many successes as possible. We’re very proud we got more votes than anybody else running including Donald Trump. And I am very grateful for the campaign that Sen. Sanders ran because we ran a campaign based on issues not insults so I can’t speak to people who were not working for me —  who were saying whatever they were saying. I can’t speak to that. I can only speak to my campaign. " As if that   weren’t bad enough, Kaine —  a former DNC chairman himself —  jumped in at that point and said it’s acceptable for the DNC staffers to do this! "I was a DNC chair so I —  during the first Obama term," Kaine said. "You’re not going to find anybody at the DNC or the RNC or any political organization who is complete agnostic or who doesn’t have an opinion about a political candidate. Those of us who are in the realm, we got opinions about people. But there’s a difference between having an opinion about someone and having a candidate you prefer, there’s a difference between that and trying to alter the outcome. " Well, Sen. Kaine, the emails from inside the DNC prove that they tried to alter the outcome. And as per usual, there’s no accountability inside the Democratic Party. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, while resigning   is being promoted in Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Donna Brazile, the vice chair of the DNC who was also involved in the matter sending emails calling Sanders’ team "stupid" and "lunacy," is taking over the DNC. And there’s been no accountability from any of the rest of the staffers involved at this point. Make sure you watch the full clips of Kaine and Clinton discussing this on 60 Minutes online, since it appears that the CBS News program didn’t air them on television. UPDATE 10:10 P. M. ET, Oh man. This is hilarious. Flashback to last week at the Republican National Convention last week when Debbie Wasserman Schultz tried trolling Reince Priebus. How did that work out for her? Hey @Reince  —   I’m in Cleveland if you need another chair to help keep your convention in order. #RNCinCLE,  —   D Wasserman Schultz (@DWStweets) July 18, 2016,  Even better: Offer still stands, @Reince, @SpeakerRyan. https:  .   —   D Wasserman Schultz (@DWStweets) July 19, 2016,  UPDATE 10:06 P. M. ET, Hillary Clinton moves right along with   Amendment rhetoric as if nothing happened. For more than a decade, @TimKaine’s been leading the fight against the NRA —  right in their own backyard. https:  .   —   Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 25, 2016,  UPDATE 10:05 P. M. ET, Rather than helping her party   Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts —  a progressive icon —  goes out for cheesesteaks when she arrives in Philadelphia. Made it to Philly for #DNCinPHL! 1st stop straight from the airport: Pat’s for a cheesesteak. pic. twitter.   —   Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) July 25, 2016,  UPDATE 10:02 P. M. ET, More Fineman on Brazile: She is immensely smart and likable, but she has Louisiana political gumbo in her veins, which means that she is an   dealmaker who is comfortable with the corporate types and fixers that grassroots voters in this political year want to oust. She was allied in her early years with the   Democratic Leadership Council, a group formed in 1985 after the "liberal" candidacy of Walter Mondale lost 49 states to President Ronald Reagan. A rump parliament of Blue Dog conservative Democrats and moderates such as Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri founded the group to pull the party away from its reliance on unions, urban voters and   theorists ― and toward an alliance with Wall Street, corporations and "Reagan Democrat" cultural conservatives who favored the death penalty and welfare reform. Absolutely devastating for a Hillary Clinton campaign needing Sanders progressives on board her campaign team to get back on track. UPDATE 9:59 P. M. ET, The Huffington Post’s Howard Fineman notes progressives and Sanders supporters should be furious with the decision to import Brazile as the interim DNC chair, by running a headline lambasting the choice to "dump one centrist loyalist" in Wasserman Schultz "for another" in Brazile. "But it should be noted that DWS is being replaced ― until the election ― by another woman who was clearly friendly toward Clinton behind the scenes and whose background is no more tied to the Bernie Sanders revolution than Wasserman Schultz’s was," Fineman wrote. "Donna Brazile, a genial    political consultant and commentator from Louisiana, has been involved in centrist ― not   ― Democratic Party intramural politics for decades. " UPDATE 9:55 P. M. ET, Ed Rendell, the chairman of the Democratic National Convention, says on MSNBC that he would vote to eliminate super delegates. He also says that Hillary Clinton needs to reach out directly to Sanders supporters, something she has not yet done. UPDATE 9:52 P. M. ET, The president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the biggest labor unions in America, has apologized to Sen. Bernie Sanders. Much of the content of #DNCleaks was inappropriate, full stop. As a DNC member, I sincerely apologize to @BernieSanders for this behavior,  —   Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) July 24, 2016,  But she has been out there pushing hard for Hillary Clinton. "Hillary understands the most urgent issues confronting our country," Weingarten said of Clinton recently. "Her bold economic plan puts unions front and center. She will level the playing field for the middle class, raising incomes for hardworking families, creating   college for students, and lifting children out of poverty. " UPDATE 9:47 P. M. ET, Erica Garner, the daughter of Eric Garner, says that Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning   is not good enough. She believes Wasserman Schultz needs to resign right now. #DWS should leave now  …     Right now. #DNCLeaks,  —   officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) July 25, 2016,  UPDATE 9:42 P. M. ET, FLASHBACK  —   This Hillary Clinton supporter masquerading as a journalist at MTV has egg all over his face. The Sanders campaign, by propagating these DNC conspiracy theories, doesn’t encourage voters to be vigilant. They’re encouraging paranoia.  —   Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) December 26, 2015,  While I acknowledge that, @hunterw, the Sanders adviser said the DNC and NGP VAN "bear responsibility" because of a recommendation. Rubbish.  —   Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) December 26, 2015,  It’s irresponsible for Sanders staff to suggest a DNC conspiracy without proof, and it’s cynical for them to fundraise off that suggestion.  —   Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) December 26, 2015,  First, the Sanders campaign said that the data breach was exploited for whistleblowing purposes. Now, their data director was a DNC plant?  —   Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) December 26, 2015,  The Sanders adviser whom @hunterw interviewed declared a DNC conspiracy that ignored reported facts and the campaign’s own narrative.  —   Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) December 26, 2015,  A Sanders campaign adviser told @hunterw that their former data director was a DNC plant. Evidence? What evidence? https:  .   —   Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) December 26, 2015,  Yeah. Now there is PLENTY of evidence. Plenty. Thanks to WikiLeaks. UPDATE 9:38 P. M. ET, David Shuster, a progressive journalist, hammers Hillary Clinton for hiring Debbie Wasserman Schultz: . @HillaryClinton hires resigning DNC chair @DWStweets, sticks finger in eye of @BernieSanders supporters.  #DNCLeaks https:  .   —   David Shuster (@DavidShuster) July 25, 2016,  UPDATE 9:20 P. M. ET, Politico tells fellow   travelers at the Huffington Post that Ken Vogel sending a story to the DNC before his own editors was a "mistake": On Sunday, Politico spokesman Brad Dayspring told The Huffington Post in an email that sharing stories with sources isn’t standard practice. "Politico’s policy is to not share editorial content   except as approved by editors," Dayspring wrote. "In this case the reporter was attempting to check some very technical language and figures involving the DNC’s joint fundraising agreement with the Clinton campaign. Checking the relevant passages for accuracy was responsible and consistent with our standards Sharing the full piece was a mistake and not consistent with our policies. There were no substantive changes to the piece and in fact the final story was blasted out by the both RNC and the Sanders campaign, and prompted Politifact to revise its rating on the issue in question. " UPDATE 8:57 P. M. ET, DWS speaking engagement for Monday morning gets cancelled? Debbie Wasserman Schultz, originally slated to speak @PADems tomorrow morning, has now been removed from schedule. pic. twitter.   —   David Catanese (@davecatanese) July 25, 2016,  UPDATE 8:38 P. M. ET, Wikileaks says Brazile has been replaced! US DNC head is now Marcia Fudge who has replaced Donna Brazil for the duration of the Convention #DNCLeak,  —   WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 25, 2016,  UPDATE 8:02 P. M. ET, Oh my. "I often feel like there’s the Hillary standard and then there’s the standard for everybody else"  —  @HillaryClinton on claims she’s corrupt,  —   60 Minutes (@60Minutes) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 8:00 P. M. ET, Sanders supporters are rejecting Brazile as a choice to replace Wasserman Schultz, since she called Sanders "stupid" just a few weeks ago. Just sixty days ago, @donnabrazile called @BernieSanders "stupid." https:  .  Just reported on #SpecialReport @BretBaier.  —   James Rosen (@JamesRosenFNC) July 24, 2016,  No chance of party unity on the Democrat side: Gee DNC can you give us anymore reason for us to hate you Donna Brazile as head of the DNC  …    Well there goes any chance of party unity,  —   Rebecca Swiger (@cujokillerpug) July 24, 2016,  Donna Brazile also conspired to cheat Bernie Sanders. #DumpBrazile#DNCleak #BernItDown #SeeYouInPhilly pic. twitter.   —   Cody Longknife (@TrumpStaffel) July 24, 2016,  @donnabrazile you all need to resign and go work 4 the always corrupt hillary #neverhillary #stillsanders #demexit https:  .   —   DianeOmite (@DianeRosemond) July 24, 2016,  @donnabrazile No unity.

ET, Sanders supporters outside the DNC keep shouting down MSNBC, shouting "Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!" It’s getting embarrassing for the Clinton team. UPDATE 7:38 P. M. ET, The American Mirror has a story with photos of the giant wall the Democrats have erected around their convention in Philadelphia. Some of them below: Watch on #Periscope: lottsa fence in Philly https:  .   —   The Broken Carpenter (@brokencarpenter) July 21, 2016,  Worried abt th fence Trump will erect?

The familiar temporary 8 foot high security fence up again, from BroadPattison down to 95 ramps for DNC @FOX29philly pic. twitter.   —   Steve Keeley (@KeeleyFox29) July 20, 2016,    UPDATE 7:35 P. M. ET, MSNBC has live coverage of protesters and Sanders supporters outside the Democratic National Convention, with anchors and reporters showing how there is already more action in Philadelphia than there was in Cleveland at the Republican National Convention. There are already thousands in Philadelphia protesting the rigged system that Debbie Wasserman Schultz created to break the glass ceiling for —  and hand the nomination to —  Hillary Rodham Clinton using   and political insider tactics, running Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont out of the race. UPDATE 7:17 P. M. ET, Another disturbing email has surfaced in the WikiLeaks scandal, showing that Democrats consider Hispanic outreach "taco bowl engagement. " This discovery comes in the wake of true lunacy —  claims from Clinton’s campaign team, as reported by CNN, that somehow this WikiLeaks scandals show that Russia and Vladimir Putin are trying to help Donald Trump. @CNNSotu @jaketapper Please explain how the DNC referring to Hispanics as "Taco Bowl Engagement" is Russia’s fault?  —   watsit2u (@thumbug) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 7:14 P. M. ET, CNN has now officially benched Donna Brazile as she is set to take over in the wake of Wasserman Schultz’s forthcoming resignation. Again, it can’t be stated enough that Brazile was JUST as involved as Wasserman Schultz —  if not more so —  in this DNC scandal, so it appears the Democrats are just going to try to whitewash this with no real reforms inside the party. Replacing DWS with Donna Brazile is like replacing Bush with Cheney.  —   I Know Nothing (@jvgraz) July 24, 2016,  @wikileaks this too😂 Donna brazile is impartial they said lmao pic. twitter.   —   dutty✨ (@BlaiseAmb) July 24, 2016,  WikiLeaks, the institution that broke this whole thing wide open, even notes that Brazile is "implicated" in the scandal —  so the Democrats aren’t interested in solving the problem.

" so much for donna brazile being   she’s just as biased  corrupt as is the entire DNC#ReformTheDNC pic. twitter.   —   dutty✨ (@BlaiseAmb) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 7:10 P. M. ET, Fallon is dodging yet again when asked if he is "comfortable" with having the DNC staffers involved in this latest email scandal aboard the Clinton campaign, but did say there is "no excuse" for what they did. Again, it remains to be seen if there will be any real accountability for this since Wasserman Schultz has been promoted into the Clinton campaign in a senior position and others involved at the DNC have not faced any consequences. They include vice chair Donna Brazile, who will take over as a   chair, and people like Brad Marshall and Amy Dacey —  who plotted attacking Sanders for being Jewish. Meanwhile many more DNC staffers were involved. Accountability seems to be fleeting for Democrats. UPDATE 7:07 P. M. Viewers can barely hear Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon on MSNBC as Sanders supports are chanting "Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!" in the background. Fallon dodges the question from MSNBC whether the staff who aided Wasserman Schultz in helping hand Hillary Clinton the nomination in a "rigged system" —  as evidenced by the emails —  should be "fired. " UPDATE 7:05 P. M. ET, Reince Priebus, the RNC chairman, says that today’s events show how much of an "uphill climb" that the Democrats have in unifying their party behind Hillary Clinton. He noted that divisions inside the Democratic Party are deep, something that the media have mostly ignored throughout the election. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon, meanwhile, on MSNBC is being shouted down live by Sanders supporters in the background as he praises Wasserman Schultz. The soon to be former chair, Fallon says, will be a "key part" of the Clinton campaign moving forward. He says her forthcoming resignation is a step toward "party unity. " UPDATE 7:00 P. M. ET, Over on MSNBC, Rachel Maddow says that the Democratic Party "is going through a transformation" and it’s important that the Clinton establishment let the Sanders supporters "have their moment. " UPDATE 6:57 P. M. ET, WikiLeaks is just absolutely demolishing Clinton campaign spin, and blowing up the entire establishment media like CNN and Facebook in the process: Clinton campaign pushing lame conspiracy smear that we are Russian agents. Last time we were Mossad.

ET, Matt Drudge, the founder and editor of The Drudge Report —  the highly successful news aggregator with more than a billion monthly page views —  weighs in noting there are likely frantic DNC staffers emailing media to warn them off coverage of this   scandal. That’s probably true, and the entire media would like to just move on so they can help Hillary beat Trump in November. But we shall see if another wave of leaks comes soon.   …     And you just know there are urgent emails today between the DNC and media coordinating not to cover the emails @donnabrazile @DWStweets,  —   MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 6:27 P. M. ET, Sanders supporter Bill Press puts into context how depressing the   ticket is for Democrats on CNN: "There’s nowhere else to go. " UPDATE 6:26 P. M. ET, Where’s Bill Clinton? Has Hillary Clinton stowed him away in hiding? His Twitter account shows he has not Tweeted since July 13: Inspired by the words of @LebronJames @DwyaneWade @CP3 @carmeloanthony tonight at the #ESPYS.  https:  .   —   Bill Clinton (@billclinton) July 14, 2016,  And he hasn’t even retweeted anyone —  the last activity being retweeting a Hillary Tweet on Kaine —  since Friday: I’m thrilled to announce my running mate, @TimKaine, a man who’s devoted his life to fighting for others.   pic. twitter.   —   Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 23, 2016,  UPDATE 6:23 P. M. ET, Donald Trump says the Democratic Party is in "full meltdown" but predicts a mainstream media led whitewash of the chaotic scandals rocking the entire left right now. The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing!   say the rigged system is alive  well!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 6:22 P. M. ET, It’s worth noting that Hillary Clinton’s statement doesn’t mention or address the systemic corruption inside her own party that led to her nomination as part of a "rigged system. " She, like Obama and Biden, just praised her "friend" Wasserman Schultz and didn’t push for ANY changes or reforms. "I want to thank my longtime friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz for her leadership of the Democratic National Committee over the past five years," Clinton said. "I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year’s historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week’s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership. There’s simply no one better at taking the fight to the Republicans than Debbie —  which is why I am glad that she has agreed to serve as honorary chair of my campaign’s   program to gain ground and elect Democrats in every part of the country, and will continue to serve as a surrogate for my campaign nationally, in Florida, and in other key states. I look forward to campaigning with Debbie in Florida and helping her in her   bid —  because as President, I will need fighters like Debbie in Congress who are ready on day one to get to work for the American people. " UPDATE 6:19 P. M. ET, Protests are emerging in Philadelphia, proving that Hillary Clinton doesn’t have a united Democratic Party. The protests are already way bigger than anything seen in Cleveland last week with Trump’s Republican National Convention. First protest march in Philadelphia far bigger than anything we saw all last week in Cleveland. pic. twitter.   —   Jacob Rascon (@Jacobnbc) July 24, 2016,  Oregonian: Thousands protest in hot Philadelphia streets before the Democrats’ convention. https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Oregon4ru (@oregon4ru) July 24, 2016,  Thousands hit Philadelphia’s streets to protest DNC"https:  .

M. ET, Heavy. com has a helpful list of some of the most damning emails proving that Hillary Clinton benefitted from a "rigged system" at the Democratic National Committee, and it’s worth a read of all them and more. Check it out here at this link. UPDATE 6:13 P. M. ET, CNN Politics Editor Mark Preston tries to shift the whole thing back onto —  you guessed it —  Donald Trump! He says he thinks he could go back and find a statement from Trump from several weeks ago "trashing" Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus. Perhaps that’s why CNN’s credibility this election is in jeopardy, and why Trump is slamming what’s become known as the "Clinton News Network. " The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don’t watch CNN!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016,  If the Republican Convention had blown up with   resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie) media would go wild,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016,  Meanwhile, Trump is out slamming the DNC even harder for the "rigged system" that handed the nomination to Hillary Clinton —  proving once and for all that Hillary Clinton didn’t "break the glass ceiling," but Debbie Wasserman Schultz did it for her. Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016,  Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don’t believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 6:09 P. M. ET, Vice President Joe Biden just issued a statement that makes absolutely no mention of Wasserman Schultz and the DNC email leaks proving systemic corruption and a rigged system. Instead, he just called Wasserman Schultz his "friend. "Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had the President’s and my back over the last eight years —  and we’re incredibly grateful," Biden said. "She’s been part of our efforts to build an economy from the   to deliver quality, affordable health care to millions of Americans, and to protect equal rights for everyone. Governing is serious business. The country deserves —  and needs —  serious leaders like Debbie. A fighter for women’s health and rights. A fierce advocate for seniors and working families. A Congresswoman who knows her first job is serving her constituents —  and her first obligation is always to her beautiful family —  Steve, Jake, Rebecca, and Shelby. Debbie is an incredible public servant, and she will always be my friend. " Barack Obama, the president, in his earlier statement also didn’t address the controversy. "For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back," Obama said earlier. "This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful. Her leadership of the DNC has meant that we had someone who brought Democrats together not just for my   campaign, but for accomplishing the shared goals we have had for our country. Her critical role in supporting our economic recovery, our fights for social and civil justice and providing health care for all Americans will be a hallmark of her tenure as Party Chair.  Her fundraising and organizing skills were matched only by her passion, her commitment and her warmth. And no one works harder for her constituents in Congress than Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Michelle and I are grateful for her efforts, we know she will continue to serve our country as a member of Congress from Florida and she will always be our dear friend. " UPDATE 6:04 P. M. ET, Donald Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is calling on Hillary Clinton to follow Wasserman Schultz’s lead, and drop out of the race for president after she skated on any accountability for her own email issues. "Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned over her failure to secure the DNC’s email servers and the rigged system she set up with the Clinton campaign," Manafort said in a   statement. "Now Hillary Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz’s lead and drop out over her failure to safeguard top secret, classified information both on her unauthorized home server and while traveling abroad. Wasserman Schultz’s emails only put the Democratic Party at risk, but Hillary Clinton’s emails put all of America at risk. " UPDATE 6:02 P. M. ET, It’s also worth noting that the DNC staffers, Brad Marshall and Amy Dacey, who plotted to smear Sanders in an   way have not resigned or faced any consequences. The two DNC officials who plotted an antisemitic smear campaign, Brad Marshall and Amy Dacey, have not resigned or even publicly apologized.  —   Michael Tracey (@mtracey) July 24, 2016,  Marshall, actually, according to Politico recommended attacking Sanders because he is Jewish. "It might may (sic) no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist," Marshall wrote to his colleagues in one email that came out as part of the leak. Marshall did issue an apology on Facebook, but has faced no consequences for his actions. "I deeply regret that my insensitive, emotional emails would cause embarrassment to the DNC, the Chairwoman, and all of the staffers who worked hard to make the primary a fair and open process," Marshall said in his apology. "The comments expressed do not reflect my beliefs nor do they reflect the beliefs of the DNC and its employees. I apologize to those I offended. " Amy Dacey, who said "AMEN" in response to that suggested attack, has also faced no consequences. UPDATE 5:55 P. M. ET, No consequences, it seems, for DNC’s Luis Miranda either as he’s out Tweeting support for Donna Brazile —  the DNC vice chair who will take over as "interim" chair post convention. DNC Vice Chair Donna Brazile will serve as Interim Chair through the election #DNCinPHL,  —   Luis Miranda (@LuisMiranda) July 24, 2016,  Miranda, like Brazile, was among those who joined Wasserman Schultz in mocking Sanders. The Intercept has a decent article with clips of Miranda’s emails, in which he was personally involved in the whole scandal. Again, no consequences for anyone as Wasserman Schultz gets promoted in Clinton’s campaign and nobody at the DNC faces any real resignations or firings. UPDATE 5:52 P. M. ET, It now looks like the consequences aren’t really consequences, as is the case often with Democrats. Even though   Wasserman Schultz will be out as DNC chairwoman, Hillary Clinton has promoted her to a chairperson level position inside her own campaign! . @HillaryClinton says Debbie Wasserman Schultz will serve as "honorary chair" of campaign’s   program pic. twitter.   —   BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 5:50 P. M. ET, There had always been talk of Democrats removing Wasserman Schultz from her position, even in the wake of the 2012 election, but Barack Obama never pulled the trigger. Now, he and Clinton seem to be paying the consequences for it. Obama team decided wasn’t worth it to oust DWS after 2012 and provoke ugly fight. Maybe should have ripped band aid. https:  .   —   Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) July 24, 2016,  Obama Tells Wasserman Schultz He’s Grateful for Her DNC Service https:  .   —   Bloomberg Politics (@bpolitics) July 24, 2016,  President Obama thanks "dear friend" Debbie Wasserman Schultz following her resignation as DNC chair pic. twitter.   —   BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 5:47 P. M. ET, It seems the Sanders supporters’ concerns are validated by the actual email leak contents, as in one case the DNC’s national finance director Jordan Kaplan even offered a job to a super delegate for a vote! DNC offered job to super delegate’s friend for vote? "I’ll make you a deal." #DNCLeak https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) July 24, 2016,  Still no word whether Wasserman Schultz will be the only person to face accountability for this. UPDATE 5:44 P. M. ET, Those behind the email leak want more heads to roll —  as pressure is now building on Donna Brazile and others inside the DNC to also face consequences for their actions, not just have Wasserman Schultz facing accountability.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016,  Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 5:27 P. M. ET: A Hillary Clinton senior adviser is on MSNBC right now and is refusing to denounce the tactics of the DNC. The Clinton campaign says the DNC should conduct an "internal review" of itself and even Chuck Todd questions whether the DNC should be allowed to —  as the Clinton campaign wants to —  conduct its own internal review of itself. Todd says "there’s crowds of" people in the streets in Philadelphia who are "angry" and the Clinton adviser, Joel Benenson, is having a hard time explaining whether Bernie Sanders supporters will come in line. He does however say that Sanders will "campaign with" Clinton —  something Sanders hasn’t done yet except for his endorsement of Clinton. Benenson instead keeps slamming Donald Trump, the Republican candidate. But Green Party candidate Jill Stein is calling for Sanders to abandon Clinton and the Democratic Party and join the Green Party. There’s still time for @BernieSanders to do the right thing  —   not for the DNC, but for America. https:  .   —   Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) July 24, 2016,  UPDATE 5:23 P. M.

Hillary Clinton’s showy rewarding of corruption by DWS is an ill wind for the    of a future presidency.  —   WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 24, 2016,  Hillary Clinton statement on the resignation of DNC head after collusion scandal emerging from WikiLeaks’ #DNCLeak pic. twitter.   —   WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 24, 2016,  ORIGINAL STORY BELOW: The Democratic Party is officially in disarray as the chairperson of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) has announced her forthcoming resignation on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Convention, which starts on Monday, comes after the wrap of the Republican National Convention, which saw the nomination of billionaire businessman Donald J. Trump for president, along with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as the Vice Presidential candidate. The resignation announcement couldn’t have come at a worse time for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee who will likely win her party’s 2016 nomination for president —  alongside running mate Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) —  this week in Philadelphia. The announcement proves that Hillary Clinton’s party is divided after the revelation that DNC officials under Wasserman Schultz’s guidance pushed for Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont during the Democratic primaries and caucuses. The secret support for Clinton was exposed when Wikileaks published a huge trove of the DNC’s internal documents and emails.
