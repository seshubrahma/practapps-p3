’’ ’Mitt Romney suggested on Monday that Manhattan billionaire Donald Trump would secure the GOP nomination if Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich stay in the race until the July convention.’ ’In a preview of his interview with David Gregory for his podcast, "The David Gregory Show," Romney insisted that stopping Trump depends on whether Cruz and Kasich continue campaigning.’ ’"I think that Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich divide the vote, and that makes it easier for Mr. Trump to win the    congressional districts and the    states and get the delegates he needs to either hit the 1, 237 or get close enough to sway the uncommitted delegates on the first ballot," said Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee.’ "Romney added that if either drops out after Tuesday’s  primary, then he thinks Trump would not hit the needed 1, 237 delegates to win the nomination.
