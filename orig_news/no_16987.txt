 (CNN) With the very first state projections trickling in, political commentator Ana Navarro pumped her usual brand of energy and enthusiasm on CNN, sprinkling in a guarantee amidst the guesswork. "I can assure you that Donald Trump is going to get historic low numbers amongst Latinos, probably going to be in the teens," predicted the avowed Republican. Referencing a   conflict Trump has had with the Hispanic community    including his   pledge to build that   wall along the   border    Navarro suggested that struggles with that demographic could provide an ironic twist to the evening. "If he breaks 20 [percent with Latinos] it’s a good night for him," she said.  "If, after everything he has said, after every attack he has made against Latinos, after he has thrown out Latino anchors from press events, after he hasn’t done any outreach, after he has questioned and judged our citizenship, after he has called Mexicans rapists, it would be sweet, sweet justice if it was a Latino vote that defeated Donald Trump." Navarro then followed up her   speech with a similar message in her   Spanish, prompting host Anderson Cooper to quip: "You are not a Trump supporter, Ana Navarro." Switching back to English, Navarro answered proudly, "No. I am a   Latina and sure as hell not a Trump supporter."
