Pat Caddell talked to Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Thursday about election developments. [Caddell said, "One of the things we’ll see, and I’ll predict this now and why if Trump’s going to win he has to go to this higher ground, is, you’re going to see   …     just how much the establishment order will fight to hold onto its power and privilege at all costs. "  He continued, "It is going to be the most   assault in every direction to try to keep [Trump] out of the White House. And so this is headed to Armageddon, if you will, politically. " "This is an election where the American people have bolted," asserted Caddell, adding: They want control back of their government, and they are very   and political class. That’s why you see such a united effort by the Democrats and Republicans in the establishment who are terrified that Trump represents the diminution of their power.
