General Motors is hiring Chinese workers to build Cadillac autos that will be sold to the American taxpayers who bailed the company out in 2008. [The   hybrid version of the CT6, which is already manufactured in China, will be available in American showrooms this summer, according to Bloomberg News.  There is growing criticism about General Motors’ decision to hire Chinese workers for manufacturing jobs after accepting a huge bailout from American taxpayers. "America invested in GM and GM turned around and stabbed America in the back," Rick Manning, the president of Americans for Limited Government, told Breitbart News.    Breitbart has already reported on GM’s plan to sell the    Buick Envision in the United States.  Business mogul Donald Trump has made U. S. trade policies with countries like China a central theme of his populist campaign.  In a statement to Breitbart News, Curtis Ellis of American Jobs Alliance explains why:   Cadillac’s marketing people admit they cannot import Cadillacs into China without paying a stiff tariff. The Chinese government does this to encourage companies like GM to manufacture in China and hire Chinese. If our government put the interests of American workers and businesses first the same way China does, our people would not be jobless, our cities like Detroit would not be in ruins, and we would not be running trade deficits in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
