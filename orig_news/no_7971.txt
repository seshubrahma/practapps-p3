In discussing last night’s historic victory for Republican Donald Trump, pollster and analyst Pat Caddell told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday, "It’s what I’ve been talking about for a couple of years, the alienation, the discontent and finally this year with Donald Trump, the people found a vehicle. "["This is the rising of the people. it is what I’ve been talking about for years," said Caddell.  Comparing it to the Jacksonian revolution, said Caddell, "The American people have said this is our country   …     we are not your subjects. We are your masters. " Trump "played outside the box," continued Caddell, saying people supported him because of the "genuineness" of what he was saying and proposing.
