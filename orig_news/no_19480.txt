’  ’ "   Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is raising money   for a recount in several key states following New York magazine’s   report that several top computer scientists told Hillary   Clinton’s campaign that they had found . " ’   In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Stein press director Meleiza   Figueroa said Stein would be filing for a recount, though   Figueroa said she "can’’t let you know the details yet." ’ ’   "The Green Party has always been at the forefront of fights to   stand up for our democracy," Figueroa said. ’ ’   Stein also announced a   campaign to "demand recounts   in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania," where the campaign   claimed there are "significant discrepancies in vote totals." ’ "   As of midday Wednesday, Stein had raised less than $10, 000.   That’s nowhere near her goal of raising $2. 5 million by Friday,   which is around $500, 000 less than she raised in the entire   election cycle.

However, although   Pennsylvania primarily relies on electronic voting machines,    that they’re virtually unhackable because   they are so outdated and do not have internet connection   capabilities. And Michigan uses only paper ballots. " "   Vox noted that New York magazine’s report  of voting discrepancies.   According to the New York magazine report, Clinton performed   worse on average in Wisconsin counties that used electronic   voting machines, but it could be that Trump simply performed   better in those counties.
