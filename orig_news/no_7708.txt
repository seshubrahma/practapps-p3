Sunday on NBC’s "Meet the Press," New York Times columnist David Brooks said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will get the nomination and go down as" biggest loser in American politics. "  Brooks said, "I think it’s likely Trump. I think he’s the walking dead and he’ll get the nomination and go down to a crushing defeat and will be known for a hundred years from now people will say who’s the biggest loser in American politics and it won’t be McGovern, it won’t be Dukakis, it will be the word Trump. I hope when he is down there in Hades he’s aware of all that. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
