Asked if Republican Presidential candidates Sen Ted Cruz or Donald Trump should be considered "transactional," or "transformational" candidates today on Breitbart News Daily on Sirius XM, veteran pollster Pat Caddell told host Stephen K. Bannon: "Cruz’s or Trump’s election would be a shock to the system. "[Noting Trump is still "way up" in polls, added Caddell, "As I’ve said, we are in a revolutionary period here.   …     I think that the evidence is clear now that the public has been, in fact,   …     the match has been lit. The public has moved. They are in motion. I don’t know where they’re going to go. "  Asked what he meant by "The fuse has been lit," Caddell elaborated: We are seeing the transformation of the paradigm of politics. All the old rules are failing. All the old assumptions don’t work. And we have a new set of assumptions evolving. And we have a public that no longer seems to want to eat the dog food that the establishment has dished out and are, in fact, going for choices that are outside the boxes of our ordinary politics. Caddell pointed out how the conventional wisdom nine months ago was that Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton would prevail in their respective primaries. "The country is saying, no we want something different. And we want to take back   …     most importantly, reclaiming our sovereignty," he said, adding that people seem to have gone from being passive observers, to active participants. Caddell said he believes that many people who usually didn’t vote before are now coming out to do so. He also said that the race in South Carolina seems to be getting so personal that there may always be hard feelings impacting people’s ability to come toget afterwards but that it was always going to be a bloodbath, which SC politics often are. "If there polls today are correct," said Caddell, "It’s not hurting Trump. " He has less faith in some internal polls being pushed by campaigns, or Super PACs.
