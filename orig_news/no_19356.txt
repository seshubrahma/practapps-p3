’  ’ ’UTAH  —   Voters across the reliably red state of   Utah have lost faith in the Republican Party. ’ ’   And while Donald Trump might have been the final straw, for some,   the disillusion with the Grand Old Party started years ago. ’ ’   "[President George W.] Bush and the Senate and the House of   Representatives all had control for six years," Barry Richardson,   36, said after a town hall for independent presidential candidate   Evan McMullin in Brigham City, Utah, on Friday. ’ ’   "And they didn’’t do anything to reform. The Medicaid thing that   Bush put in place was one of the largest increases in   entitlements. And he did no other reforms. He didn’’t do anything   to help control costs on the war. He went into the war under   false pretenses." ’ ’   Lynn Adair, a    who works in advertising sales, said   she sees too much corruption in the Republican Party. ’ ’   "I’’m not happy with [the Republican Party]. Not at all," she said   after a McMullin meet and greet in Nephi, Utah, on Saturday. "I’’m   more about individualism." ’ ’   Republicans are "just as corrupt as the Democrats," she said. ’ ’   "I don’’t trust any of them," she continued. ’ "   Business Insider crisscrossed Utah with McMullin’s campaign over   the weekend and found dozens of conservative voters who are   severing ties with the party that has been their political home   their whole lives. " ’   McMullin, a Mormon conservative from Provo, Utah, says he is   building a "new conservative movement" that will serve as a   refuge for disaffected Republicans fleeing the party that’’s   crumbling under the weight of Donald Trump’’s candidacy and the   divisive rhetoric the billionaire businessman has brought with   him. ’ "   A significant proportion of the electorate in Utah has balked at   Trump, who doesn’t quite embody the family values that are so   important in the deeply religious and conservative state. " ’   "I’’ve been Republican my whole life, but Trump doesn’’t work for   me at all," Charles Greatwood, a    engineer, said after   the McMullin town hall in Brigham City. "Of course, Democrats   never work for me. And I wasn’’t going to vote for Trump just   because he was the lesser of two evils. I’’m done with that.   Especially when I heard his tape." ’ ’   McMullin’’s campaign got off to a slow start, but then the "Access   Hollywood" tape leaked. Trump was heard on the 2005 recording   making lewd comments about women and bragging about how his   celebrity status allowed him to grope them. ’ ’   "I was kind of a weak Trump supporter until I heard that Billy   Bush hot mic, and then I said I’’m done with Trump, and I’’m done   with the Republican Party," Greatwood said. "So I saw Evan   McMullin, and he was just right. He was just what I was looking   for." ’ ’  ’ ’   Greatwood’’s wife, Nan, said she was "in a state of shock" over   Trump winning the Republican presidential nomination. She cited   his controversial comments about women, the military, and people   with disabilities. On the campaign trail, Trump has often called   the military a "disaster" and . ’ ’   "I have a disabled son, and we have a son in the military, and   I’’m a survivor of sexual abuse," Nan, a        owner, said. "And none of those things worked for   me, so it was like, ’’OK, I see through him. ’’" ’ ’   Republican presidential candidates have won Utah in every   election since 1964, when the state voted for Democrat Lyndon B.   Johnson. ’ ’   But this election might break that streak. Utah has turned into a   battleground state as McMullin has made inroads with   disillusioned Republicans. ’ ’   One poll in   showed McMullin taking the lead over both   Trump and Clinton in the Beehive State. And on the eve of   Election Day, the "Never Trump" candidate was at 25% in the   . ’ "   But it’s not just Trump  —   Utah voters said they’re also   disappointed with Republican leadership for not doing more to   stand up to Trump. " ’   "When he’’s proposing all of these things, no one stood up to say   ’’no,’’" Nan Greatwood said, alluding to Trump’’s more controversial   comments. "I mean, if it would have been a Democrat doing it,   they would have been glad to stand up to him. And they didn’’t   have the guts to tell [Trump]." ’ "   Shirley Case, 72, is a lifelong Republican who said she’s   discouraged and frustrated by what the party has turned into. " ’   "I remember when I was younger I used to try and vote for the   candidate who I felt like was somebody of character," Case said   after an event at a restaurant in Ephraim, Utah. ’ ’  ’ ’   Her disappointment in Republican presidential candidates runs   back to the 1980s. ’ ’   "It amazes me. I have felt like our voting system has been fixed   for a long time," she said. "When [Bob] Dole was running, I   thought ’’All of these people and Dole, I don’’t understand how   that happens. ’’ And the same way with McCain, I thought ’’All of   these people for us to choose from in a primary, and we get   McCain? ’’" ’ ’   Some Utah voters were even hesitant about Mitt Romney, the 2012   Republican nominee. Romney is a Mormon who received his   undergraduate degree from Brigham Young University in Utah. ’ ’   "I voted for Mitt last time, and I even had my issues with Mitt,"   said Lee Demille, 30, who works at a Church of Jesus Christ of     Saints temple in Provo. "And he’’s LDS.   …     I don’’t think   he talked the same     points as Evan   McMullin has." ’ ’   The election is such a   subject in Utah that Demille   said it has driven a wedge between him and his family. ’ ’   "I’’m not going to Thanksgiving dinner because of it," he said.   "My parents, my whole entire family is Trump supporters. We are   not on speaking terms right now." ’ ’   McMullin has marketed himself as a true conservative, unlike   Trump. ’ ’   He supports small government, respects capitalism, is     emphasizes the need for entitlement reform, and   wants to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. His speeches   are often tinged with rhetoric about "life, liberty, and the   pursuit of happiness" and respecting the Constitution. ’ ’   "I like him because he’’s conservative," Case said of McMullin.   "There’’s a   about him, and I feel like Washington is   just mired in corruption, and it doesn’’t seem like anymore like   we the people have much say." ’ "   Gayle Crofts, a    homemaker, said after a McMullin meet   and greet in Richfield, Utah, that she’s officially leaving the   Republican Party after the election. " ’   "I am unaffiliating myself as soon as I vote," she said. "These   are not my values anymore. I go to caucuses, I’’ve even been a   delegate, and I feel like it stands for things I believe in, but   as far as how they act  —   I don’’t think the Republicans and   Democrats are that far apart in how they act." ’
