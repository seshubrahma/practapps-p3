Deputy Assistant to the President Dr. Sebastian Gorka, formerly National Security editor for Breitbart News, addressed the controversy over National Security Adviser Mike Flynn’s   phone calls to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on Monday’s Breitbart News Daily. ["I can’t comment on what was said, or what wasn’t said, on those telephone calls even though the good general himself says that he can’t remember all the details," Gorka said. "All I can tell you is my personal experience. I spent several months working very closely with General Flynn and the transition team, in his National Security Council transition team. He’s a man you would trust with your life. He’s a great patriot, man of honor, worn the cloth of the Republic.  "The bottom line is, he shook things up in the DIA, and there are a lot of people who want to take revenge on him. Names I’m not going to list across the airwaves right now, but people who do a little bit of research can work out. The Establishment doesn’t like General Flynn, and for me, that’s a good thing," he told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. Marlow proposed that Flynn was but the latest target of the Left’s "pick a target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it" strategy, as defined by Saul Alinsky in Rules for Radicals. "You’re absolutely correct," Gorka said. "Whether it’s Steve Bannon, whether it’s Stephen Miller, whether it was Monica Crowley, or whether it’s General Flynn now. Important point for the listeners, and this is what has to be grasped: it’s never about the issues. It’s not about Russia, it’s not about the safety of Americans, it’s not about preventing attacks like Paris or Nice happening in America. It’s the triangulation. We have to isolate and take down the individuals, separate them from their community, pillory them, and then just make their position untenable. It’s classic Alinsky, and I’m sorry, they’re just picking on the wrong guy, because this guy is as hard as nails. " Turning to President Donald Trump’s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Gorka said "the message that has to be taken home by everybody  —   our allies, our partners, and our competitors and our potential enemies  —   is that our relationship with Japan is back on track. "Do you remember the ‘Asia pivot’ that wasn’t a pivot, that ended in China intimidating all her neighbors, building fake atolls with military installations on top of them? That age is over. Whether it’s sending a message to put Iran on notice, or whether it’s rekindling one of our closest ties in the region with Japan, this is a new age for America in foreign policy. " Gorka said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s upcoming visit to the White House would cover the "obvious issues," such as "what can we do, as the outside potential interlocutor, to bring stability, to bring some kind of lasting peace to the region?" "As part of that, it’s going to have to be a discussion of settlements, what is the status of settlements," he said. "On top of that, one of the things that we are very keen on is to represent an understanding to the world that Israel isn’t alone. It’s not the threat to Israel from local terrorists. It’s the same thing as Orlando, as the attacks in New York, in Boston. There is this, what I like to call the global jihadi movement, and Israel is as much on the frontline  —   if not more  —   than any other country. So we want to bring that international recognition that Israel isn’t just our strongest partner in the region, it’s also really on the frontline of the war against the global jihadists. " Gorka said the White House was not so much "shifting policy" with its latest statements on Israeli settlements, but offering a "nuanced explication of what our policy is. " "I’m not part of that team, but I’ve spoken to the people that are working that issue, and it’s a fine line," he said. "What we have suggested is that when it comes to the settlements, you can build on what you’ve already got. So if you’ve got a building, and you want to go up another story, it’s fine. But going to new territories is not going to help anybody. So we’d like to see a little bit of a snapshot in time. Let’s not have any more territory taken as part of the settlements, so that we can get down to some serious negotiations right now. "That’s a nuanced policy statement from the team, but I think it bears recognition as acting in good faith, so we can bring the partners to the table. " Another imminent presidential meeting will involve Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, described by Marlow as "pretty much the  " for being "a young man who is very photogenic," raised in an atmosphere of deep   politics for his entire life. Gorka thought the two leaders might find common ground by acknowledging "there are issues that have to be dealt with in every country," including "the tension with regard to the terrorist threat internally. " "We may be from different political communities, but the bottom line, it’s our northerly neighbor. They share a lot of the same issues that we share, especially when it comes to national security," he observed. "President Trump is the master of the deal, and he can negotiate with people who even have different political opinions. So let’s see what the day brings, but I think it will be a substantive meeting for both parties. " Gorka said President Trump will soon decide how to proceed on his immigration executive order, after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a judicial restraining order against it. He praised the analysis Breitbart News has offered on the decision. "Let’s not talk about the fact that the Ninth Circuit Court has been reversed 82 times. That’s their batting average. What Breitbart has very, very rightly revealed is that of the seven nations on the list that came from the Obama administration, 72 nationals of those nations have been convicted of jihadi terrorist activity in America since September the 11th," he said.  "This narrative, this politicized narrative that it’s Islamophobic, and it has nothing to do with terrorism, and nobody from those countries has ever committed terrorist acts in America is so totally and utterly fallacious that we need to reset the standard of the discussion. It’s about national security.   people  —   think about that. That’s more than five times the number of hijackers that did September the 11th. So we are going to maintain our commitment to that executive order and those seven countries being on a temporary halt. " Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 to 9 a. m.
