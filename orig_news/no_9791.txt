Sunday on CNN’s "Fareed Zakaria GPS," Presidents Richard Nixon and President Gerald Ford’s former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said   Donald Trump is "unique" among presidents in the fact that "he has absolutely no baggage. He has no obligation to any particular group. "  Kissinger said, "This   is the most unique that I have experienced in one respect, he has absolutely no baggage. He has no obligation to any particular group because he has become a president on the basis of his own strategy and a program he put before the American public that his competitors did not present. So that is a unique situation. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
