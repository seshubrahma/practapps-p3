Following Donald Trumpâ€™s election in November, Apple is now seeking to expand their U. S. operations with new "  manufacturing" in Arizona, according to Business Insider. [In the report, Apple requested permission conduct a new wave of "  manufacturing" at a factory in Mesa, Arizona, as well as approval from the   Zones Board to build "finished products" exempt from normal customs duty payments.  "Apple Inc has repurposed the site as a global data command center that will conduct   manufacturing of finished data center cabinets for other data centers," read the document, published by the Federal Register on Monday. If approved, the operations could create a range of new jobs in the area, with Apple currently advertising a "Data Center Site Services Technician" position for their Mesa factory.   Donald Trump repeatedly criticised Apple and other prominent US companies for producing their products overseas, promising that should he be elected, companies would return to manufacturing their products in America. Apple has already signaled that it may move some of its iPhone production back to America, having already asked two iPhone assemblers, Foxconn and Pegatron Corp. to explore the possibility of making iPhones in the U. S. You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com
