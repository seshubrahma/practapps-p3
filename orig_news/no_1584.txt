(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.  Donald Trump seemed to suggest that gun rights backers could take matters into their own hands if Hillary Clinton nominated judges who favor gun control. "If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks," Mr. Trump said at a rally in North Carolina. "Although the Second Amendment people  —   maybe there is, I don’t know. " His campaign maintained that he was referring to political activism, but Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager responded: "What Trump is saying is dangerous. " _____ 2. Here’s another way  this presidential election stands out. This time, donors whose Republican candidates have left the race are not shifting their support to the Republican nominee, but rather channeling their money across party lines to Hillary Clinton. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign is also seeing a rare opening in Utah, where Mormons  —   who prize religious freedom  —   have been shaken by Mr. Trump’s proposal to bar Muslims from immigrating. Above, the Mormon temple in Provo. Check out our new podcast, The   featuring our team of political reporters. _____ 3. The U. S. women’s gymnastics team triumphed at the Olympics. But frictions over doping are coloring, and sometimes overshadowing, the Games. Some athletes are vilifying competitors suspected of using   drugs. Our full coverage of the Games is here. _____ 4. Michael Phelps, who already held more Olympic gold medals by far than any other athlete, won his 20th and 21st tonight. His win in the   butterfly was loaded with meaning: He beat Chad le Clos, the South African who defeated him in this event at the last Olympics. Phelps’s   routine during Monday night’s semifinals included this fearsome grimace, now viral as #PhelpsFace, made while le Clos warmed up nearby. Here’s our Photo Firehose, a   stream of images from the Games. _____ 5. Four more cases of Zika were identified in Florida, prompting Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, to castigate Congress for inaction. "The federal government must stop playing politics and Congress needs to immediately come back to session to resolve this," he said. Above, a plane sprayed pesticide over the Miami neighborhood linked to more than a dozen cases of the virus. _____ 6. The leaders of Russia and Turkey, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, met in St. Petersburg. They pledged to end months of antagonism and begin a new era of cooperation. The rapprochement is not welcome in the West, which relies on Turkey as a NATO ally that shares the hope of ending the war in Syria, and seeing that country’s president, Bashar   step down. _____ 7. Some 20 million Americans have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Evidence is now emerging that the insurance is, as hoped, increasing people’s health and protecting them from   debt. Separate studies show that minority patients tend to receive less medication for pain than whites. That has protected them to some extent from the nation’s epidemic of opioid abuse, but leaves a disproportionate number suffering from disabling pain.

The report finds that officers used excessive force, conducted unlawful stops and targeted blacks in violation of residents’ constitutional rights. One man was stopped 30 times without ever being charged. The findings are the conclusion of an investigation that began after the death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a fatal spinal injury while in police custody. None of the six police officers who were charged were convicted. _____ 9. Temperatures are rising across much of the country this week. Our science reporter looked at the environmental toll of air conditioning and found some good news. If your unit is working properly, it won’t release hydrofluorocarbons, which trap thousands of times as much heat as carbon dioxide. Still, that’s not a ticket to   overuse.   accounts for about 6 percent of U. S. energy use, resulting in about 100 million tons of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere annually. _____ 10. Facebook found a way to  block ad blockers, at least on desktops. The move is likely to deepen frustration and debate over digital ads, which slow downloads and intrude on content  —   but also bring revenue to platforms like the one you are on right now. Facebook overhauled its ad preferences tool, enabling users to opt for more relevant ads. _____ 11. Finally, it’s the era of the new grandparents. Healthy, active, often still working, many are providing more financial support these days  —   but less babysitting. "They all have full lives now," said the editor of Grandparents. com. "They don’t just drop everything. " _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
