’  ’ ’   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau received an unusually warm   reception of his keynote address at an energy industry conference   in Texas on Thursday evening. ’ ’   "No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground   and just leave them there," Trudeau said in his address to oil   and gas industry executives at Houston’’s  conference, discussing   Alberta’’s vast oil sands reserves. ’ "   Trudeau’s speech was met with a standing ovation from the more   than 1, 200 attendees  —   an unordinary reaction to a keynote   speaker,   .

Canada is that source." ’ ’   Trudeau has been under fire from Canada’’s oil industry after he   stumbled while discussing the topic in January. He told an   audience in Ontario that the oil sands should be phased out,   later telling  that he "misspoke." ’ "   Trudeau’s speech also touted his support for the Keystone XL   pipeline, one of the few areas where he and US President Donald   Trump share common ground.

" ’   "Anything that creates impediments at the border, extra tariffs,   or new taxes is something we are concerned with," Trudeau said.   "You can applaud against the border adjustment tax." ’ ’ ’ ’Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau received. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
