Florida’s Attorney General, Pam Bondi, endorsed GOP frontrunner Donald Trump at his campaign rally in Tampa, Florida on Monday afternoon. ["I look around this country and this world and it frightens me now and it should frighten all of us," Bondi told Trump’s supporters during his campaign rally in her home town. "We are about the protection and security of our nation   …     [and] we need leadership," she added.  "We need someone who is unafraid to lead and restore America to its greatness," Bondi continued. "Today I am proud to endorse Donald Trump for President of the United States of America. " "I ran as an outsider for attorney general," Bondi recalled. "I felt Florida needed to be changed and now our country and our world needs someone who is going to protect our security like never before and that’s why I support Donald. " "I always listen to my mom and my mom is with Donald Trump and so am I!" she exclaimed. "I see how he treats Ivanka and his kids," she added. "It is my great honor to receive the endorsement from a leader as highly respected as Attorney General Pam Bondi. I love the people of Florida, where over the years, I have invested my time, hundreds of millions of dollars and employed thousands of people. Pam is one of the many individuals I have formed a great relationship with and I am very proud to receive her support," Trump said. Bondi stated, "People today are looking for leadership, the kind that Mr. Trump offers, that’s unafraid to tell it like it is and will do something about renewing America’s strength and greatness. That’s why I am pleased to announce my support of Donald Trump for President. We have been friends for years, and I know his family personally. I’ve seen   how he leads, and how he cares deeply about the people of this country. If elected President I know he will bring America’s best minds together to preserve what we have, and secure what we need, for the future. "
