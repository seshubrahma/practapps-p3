Product and design company FCTRY has unveiled its latest product  —   a middle   action figure in the likeness of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. [The Brooklyn, New   company began accepting   on Wednesday and promised to begin production on its Trump "over   figure" doll if its $15, 000 goal is met by Election Day.  "Make action figures great again," the FCTRY   page reads, a play on the Republican nominee’s campaign slogan. In a section marked "The Story," the company says: "We’ve been making lame, sissy action figures for years but now we are finally ready to take presidential toy making to the next level. We are proud to introduce the new Donald Trump Action Figure  —   literally the greatest action figure ever made!" Taking several digs at the White House hopeful, the company’s   doll features the man with a raised middle finger, "removable hair for easy cleaning," "sturdy and durable shoes for stepping on feelings" and "  hands approved by little Marco Rubio. " FCTRY, which has produced Senator Bernie Sanders and "Ready for Action" figures for Hillary Clinton, plans to sell its "made in China" Trump dolls for $20. The company also says five percent of the profits from every Trump action figure sold will go to Border Angels, "a pretty questionable charity that   …     provides illegal Mexican immigrants with drinking water and medical assistance. " At the time of publication, the campaign had raised more than half its $15, 000 goal.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson
