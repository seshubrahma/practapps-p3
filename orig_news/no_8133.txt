" "What a rigged system, folks!" he continued. "The corrupt media is trying to do everything in their power to stop our movement. They don’t want this happening. " Baldwin is set to play Trump for the entirety of Saturday Night Live‘s 42nd season. Watch the   of the second presidential debate above.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
