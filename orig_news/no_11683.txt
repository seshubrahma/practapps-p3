HBO’s "Real Time" host Bill Maher wondered how Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio "are the patriots who the military likes?" on Friday.  Maher said, that Americans who believe America isn’t number one militarily are "so dead stupid f*cking wrong. " He added, "Trump said last night, we don’t get any victories. First of all, how is this not insulting the military? Actually, our military had a pretty good week this week. We smoked  . We smoked ISIS. Here’s Marco Rubio, ‘America’s influence has declined, while the president has destroyed our military.’ Utter lie. Ted Cruz, ‘Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years has dramatically degraded our military.’ Utter lie. Donald Trump, ‘We don’t win with the military. We can’t beat ISIS. We don’t win [with] anything.’ How come these guys are the patriots who the military likes?" Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
