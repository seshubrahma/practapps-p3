Saturday, while discussing who had the best week, former deputy Martin O’Malley campaign manager and Obama 2012 campaign aide Lis Smith said on MSNBC’s "AM Joy" that presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is a "racist," "fascist" and "xenophobe. "  "Let me preface this by saying Donald Trump is a racist, he is a fascist he is a xenophobe. I think he would be the worst president in American history, but I think he won the week because you know, we saw at the end of this week that he’s running against Hillary Clinton. He’s not running against Barack Obama. You know, she had more   troubles. There was that   meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton on the tarmac," Smith told host Joy Reid.
