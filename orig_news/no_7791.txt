Republican nominee Donald Trump responded to the attack in Munich, Germany where at least nine people were killed in what officials say appears to be a terrorist attack. ["Our prayers are with all those affected by the horrible attacks in Munich. This cannot continue," Trump said in a press release on Friday evening. "The rise of terrorism threatens the way of life for all civilized people, and we must do everything in our power to keep it from our shores. "  According to CNN, the gunman is also dead, which puts the total death count at 10. No organization has taken credit for the attack.
