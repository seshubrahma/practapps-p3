Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan issued a joint statement following their meeting on Capitol Hill with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, saying that "there’s a great opportunity to unify our party," and they "had a great conversation. "["The United States cannot afford another four years of the Obama White House, which is what Hillary Clinton represents," the statement begins. "That is why it’s critical that Republicans unite around our shared principles, advance a conservative agenda, and do all we can to win this fall. "  With that focus, we had a great conversation this morning. While we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground. We will be having additional discussions, but remain confident there’s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall, and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal. We are extremely proud of the fact that many millions of new voters have entered the primary system, far more than ever before in the Republican Party’s history. This was our first meeting, but it was a very positive step toward unification. Following his meeting with Ryan and Priebus, Trump will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ).
