Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Before disaster struck, Anthony Booth Armer had an epic summer. It started one day last June, during his shift as a server at a Laguna Beach restaurant. He had a flash of insight, he said  —   he needed a change. "And I got my stuff, walked out and just said: ‘I’m going to push it in what I love 100 percent. And that’s all I’m going to do. ’" That’s the moment the Laguna Beach jumper was born. Over the next months, Mr. Armer, 28, became an internet sensation by filming himself making dozens of   leaps into water from structures across the region. He seemed to flirt with death, rocketing within inches of rocks and ledges. His YouTube videos have raked in more than 23 million views and drawn attention from around the world. Comedy Central’s "Tosh. 0" ran a segment. Much of the online reaction has been withering, with some people criticizing Mr. Armer’s judgment and predicting a bad end. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, and it happened. Launching himself from a rooftop, he struck the edge of a hotel swimming pool and badly shattered both of his feet. Now, a gambit that seemed to be going so well has turned his life upside down. Doctors told him he may not be able to run again. Mr. Armer faces trespassing and other charges. His family is angry with him, he said. And an anticipated windfall from his YouTube channel never came. (He said he’s made roughly $6, 000.) Asked if he harbored regrets, he said: "I mean, you could think of it in that way. I think of it as paying dues. I felt like I was in debt with the universe, so to speak. " He added, "I think that this is just a lesson to show that I need to be more respectful. " And after he heals up? He’s eyeing wingsuits, he said.

[KRCR] At a confirmation hearing on Tuesday for Representative Xavier Becerra, who has been nominated to be California’s next attorney general, the big question on Democrats’ minds was hard to miss. How would Mr. Becerra handle the incoming Trump administration? Democratic members of a special Assembly committee made clear that they expected Mr. Becerra, a son of immigrants, to be a bulwark against any federal challenges to California’s stands on immigration, the environment and civil rights. Some of the remarks: The panel voted along party lines, 6 to 3, to support Mr. Becerra. The Republicans said he failed to assuage their concerns on issues including public safety and religious freedom. Next up, the nomination goes before the full chamber.
