’  ’ "   President Barack Obama is marking the first anniversary of the   Iran nuclear deal  that the accord can’t   easily be undone and is preferable to war. " ’   "The United States must remember that this agreement was the   result of years of work and represents an agreement between the   world’’s major powers  —   not simply the United States and Iran,"   Obama said in the statement. ’ ’   The outgoing president noted that a diplomatic solution that   keeps Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is preferable to an   "unconstrained Iranian nuclear program or another war in the   Middle East." ’ ’   "Iran reduced its uranium stockpile by 98 percent and removed     of its centrifuges," the statement read. "Meanwhile,   Iran has not enriched any uranium at the Fordow facility nor used   advanced centrifuges to enrich. In short, Iran is upholding its   commitments, demonstrating the success of diplomacy." ’ ’   Obama noted that the US opposes "Iran’’s threats against Israel   and our Gulf partners and its support for violent proxies in   places like Syria and Yemen" and remains "deeply concerned about   US citizens unjustly imprisoned in Iran." But he said that there   was "no question" that "the challenges we face with Iran would be   much worse if Iran were also on the threshold of building a   nuclear weapon." ’ ’’ ’     Donald Trump, who takes office on Friday, vowed   at times during the presidential campaign either to walk away   from the deal or to renegotiate it. ’ ’   Iran agreed in 2015 to limit its ability to enrich uranium in   exchange for the removal of some international economic   sanctions. ’
