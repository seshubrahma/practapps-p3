"Trump now believes that   climate change is real" claims a headline in Mother Jones. (Top trolling, guys. Almost worthy of the Master, DJT himself. )["In shift, Donald Trump says humans may be causing global warming," says PBS.  According to The Washington Post, meanwhile:   Donald Trump appears to be softening his tone on whether climate change is real and on his stated plans to scrap the recent multinational agreement to limit carbon emissions. The name for this nonsense is "fake news"  —   as becomes clear when you read the transcripts of what   Trump actually said at his meeting with The New York Times. THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, opinion columnist: But it’s really important to me, and I think to a lot of our readers, to know where you’re going to go with this. I don’t think anyone objects to, you know, doing all forms of energy. But are you going to take America out of the world’s lead of confronting climate change? TRUMP: I’m looking at it very closely, Tom. I’ll tell you what. I have an open mind to it. We’re going to look very carefully. It’s one issue that’s interesting because there are few things where there’s more division than climate change. You don’t tend to hear this, but there are people on the other side of that issue who are, think, don’t even   …     ARTHUR SULZBERGER Jr. publisher of The New York Times: We do hear it. So at this point, Trump is gently introducing the NYT‘s liberals to the concept that not everyone thinks the same way on climate change as they do. Let’s carry on, shall we? FRIEDMAN: I was on ‘Squawk Box’ with Joe Kernen this morning, so I got an earful of it. [laughter] TRUMP: Joe is one of them. But a lot of smart people disagree with you. I have a very open mind. And I’m going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and we’re going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind. SULZBERGER: Well, since we’re living on an island, sir, I want to thank you for having an open mind. We saw what these storms are now doing, right? We’ve seen it personally. Straight up. FRIEDMAN: But you have an open mind on this? TRUMP: I do have an open mind. And we’ve had storms always, Arthur. SULZBERGER: Not like this. TRUMP: You know the hottest day ever was in   98. You know, you can make lots of cases for different views. I have a totally open mind. My uncle was for 35 years a professor at M. I. T. He was a great engineer, scientist. He was a great guy. And he was   …     a long time ago, he had feelings  —   this was a long time ago  —   he had feelings on this subject. It’s a very complex subject. I’m not sure anybody is ever going to really know. I know we have, they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists. Where was that, in Geneva or wherever five years ago? Terrible. Where they got caught, you know, so you see that and you say, what’s this all about. I absolutely have an open mind. I will tell you this: Clean air is vitally important. Clean water, crystal clean water is vitally important. Safety is vitally important. And you know, you mentioned a lot of the courses. I have some great, great, very successful golf courses. I’ve received so many environmental awards for the way I’ve done, you know. I’ve done a tremendous amount of work where I’ve received tremendous numbers. Sometimes I’ll say I’m actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand that’s true. Open mind. Trump, it is obvious to anyone with half a brain, is taking the piss. He is telling the NYT‘s liberal assembly "I hear what you say" and then, ever so nicely, indicating that he doesn’t give a toss. The way he repeats that phrase "open mind". He’s trolling them, basically. (Especially where he tells them he’s an "environmentalist": classic Trump.) JAMES BENNET, editorial page editor: When you say an open mind, you mean you’re just not sure whether human activity causes climate change? Do you think human activity is or isn’t connected? TRUMP: I think right now   …     well, I think there is some connectivity. There is some, something. It depends on how much. It also depends on how much it’s going to cost our companies. You have to understand, our companies are noncompetitive right now. They’re really largely noncompetitive. About four weeks ago, I started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my speeches, that we’ve lost 70, 000 factories since W. Bush. 70, 000. When I first looked at the number, I said: ‘That must be a typo. It can’t be 70, you can’t have 70, 000, you wouldn’t think you have 70, 000 factories here.’ And it wasn’t a typo, it’s right. We’ve lost 70, 000 factories. We’re not a competitive nation with other nations anymore. We have to make ourselves competitive. We’re not competitive for a lot of reasons. That’s becoming more and more of the reason. Because a lot of these countries that we do business with, they make deals with our president, or whoever, and then they don’t adhere to the deals, you know that. And it’s much less expensive for their companies to produce products. So I’m going to be studying that very hard, and I think I have a very big voice in it. And I think my voice is listened to, especially by people that don’t believe in it. And we’ll let you know. "We’ll let you know. " In other words: "I’ll get back to you. " In other words: "Sorry. Not interested in your business. Got better things to do. "
