Donald Trump is going after the media, threatening to sue publications for writing negatively about him. [During a Friday rally in Texas, Trump launched into a monologue about how he felt that the media was treating him unfairly, alleging that the New York Times and Washington Post, in particular, were not covering him well.  "The New York Times, which is losing a fortune, which is a failing newspaper, which probably won’t be around much longer   …     but I think the New York Times is one of the most dishonest media outlets I’ve ever seen in my life," the businessman said. "They have an agenda that you wouldn’t believe. " "If I become president, oh, do they have problems. They’re gonna have such problems," Trump said. He added: One of the things I’m gonna do, and this is only gonna make it tougher for me, and I’ve never said this before, but one of the things I’m gonna do if I win   …     is I’m gonna open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money. We’re gonna open up those libel laws. So that when the New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace, or when the Washington Post   …     writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money, instead of having no chance of winning because they’re totally protected. Trump continued his speech, threatening to roll back the media’s First Amendment protections in the Constitution. "With me, they’re not protected, because I’m not like other people  …     We’re gonna open up those libel laws, folks, and we’re gonna have people sue you like you never got sued before," he said.
