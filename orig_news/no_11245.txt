  Democrat pollster Pat Caddell spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Monday about the weekend’s terrorist attacks in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota, and questioned if they should be considered "the new normal. "[Caddell stated, "I don’t think that this was the end of it. We may, sadly, see more. But the question here is, are we to accept this as the new normal?" He added, "Or are we going to take the approach, ‘Not in our house’ and really get tough on this stuff?"  Added Caddell, "I suspect this will now have a huge impact on the race. The media was all over Trump on Saturday for saying the obvious, that it was a bomb. " "I think what we’re going to find in this country is, finally, it’s enough," he went on. "It’s a very simple matter. Are you willing to take this as the new normal and just adjust to it   …      or are you going to get serious about this stuff, including taking in all the new refugees?" "I think the political elite," said Caddell, "and the globalists in this country   …     will say, ‘Well, just get used to it it’s the new normal.’ I don’t think mainstream America is  going to be there. That’s not an American attitude. " "To that extent, I think if Trump is on that message, it’ll work," he concluded.
