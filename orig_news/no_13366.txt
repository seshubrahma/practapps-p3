Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders posted   Trump messages on at least four electric road construction signs in Dallas, Texas Monday evening. [The culprits hacked the signs which run along Interstate 30 in Dallas. Two of the hacked road signs had messages that read, "Bernie for President. " Another electronic sign said, "Go back home, work is canceled. "  Two more signs featured a bizarre message disparaging the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. "Donald Trump is a shape shifting lizard," the signs read. According to local news station KHOU, the Texas Department of Transportation has launched an investigation into how the signs were hacked. In a statement released to the press, Tony Hartzel, of the Texas Department of Transportation, said "TxDOT takes this matter very seriously. These signs were secured and turned off until someone broke into them to enter these messages. Such actions endanger the safety of themselves and motorists, and the messages could also become a distraction to motorists driving on the highway. " Hartzelâ€™s statement continues: Buyers Barricades, the   company that furnishes the roads signs, has also opened an independent investigation of the incident.
