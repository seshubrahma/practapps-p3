" He added, "One of the things I’m seeing, and I don’t know if you’re seeing this, but if you look at social media or media in general, I see a lot of people who are scared, and a lot of people who are resentful and focused on their own hurt feelings. Both Trump supporters and Trump opponents. It almost seems as though people are not even willing to acknowledge the hurt feelings of the people on the other side.
