"We’re going to take care of it. "  New Hampshire has consistently been one of the states with the highest rate of deaths caused by drug overdose. According to the CDC: In 2014, the five states with the highest rates of death due to drug overdose were West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Kentucky and Ohio.
