GOP frontrunner Donald Trump vowed to his supporters in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on Friday afternoon that he will do more for African Americans in one year than President Barack Obama has done in his eight years in office. ["I will do more for the African American people in one year than Barack Obama has done in his seven years  —   soon to be eight years  —   and then by the way, he’s out and thank goodness, ok?" Trump told his supporters at his first of three campaign rallies on Friday.  He said that African Americans between the ages of 24 and 40 have a high unemployment rate and it’s "gotten worse since he’s been president. " "They know jobs are going to come," Trump said of African Americans supporting him. "They get it. " "We’re going to have a tremendous   vote," Trump also said, referencing how polls show he beats both Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) in    match ups in the general election. "I have a chance to win New York," he explained, adding, "I’ll win New Jersey. " The real estate mogul said other Republican presidential candidates can’t win those states. "I’ll win Michigan," Trump added. "That’s not even a state the Republicans talk about. "
