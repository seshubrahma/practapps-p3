PORTLAND, OREGON —  For the fourth night in row, leftist and anarchist protesters destroyed property because of their anger at Donald Trump’s election. [Blocks of downtown Portland were shut down for hours as police tried to contain the angry mob of rioters who aggressively attacked law enforcement. Portland police tried to maintain with tear gas and flash bangs, but did little to deter the   crowd that remained in the streets for hours.  As TV station KGQ reported: The protest began as a peaceful rally at City Hall at 5 p. m. before protesters split into what appeared to be three groups at around 7 p. m. There were at least 1, 000 protesters and police said there were reports of vandalism and assault. Several people have been arrested. One group, organized by Portland’s Resistance, stayed at the rally in City Hall. Despite pleas from police earlier in the day, some protesters began marching on Southwest 4th Avenue, only to be stopped by police, who advised the crowd to march on a facilitated northbound route. A second group followed police orders and began marching north. Police said deviating from the route was not permitted. Earlier Friday, Portland Police Chief Mike Marshman had asked the protesters to please not protest. "Can you take a break for a day because we’re concerned the anarchist groups may jump into the crowd again," Marshman said during an interview with The  . "Their message is being overshadowed by criminal activity. We’re asking the legitimate protesters to pause. " The protests show no sign of letting up this weekend.
