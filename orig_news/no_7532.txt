Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends," Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina took a jab at her opponent GOP   Donald Trump.  Fiorina was asked about Trump’s popularity and if he was "emblematic" of the anger in the country. Fiorina acknowledged the presence of anger, but dismissed Trump as a serious candidate. "[L]ook, I don’t exactly think Esquire is an authority, but there is no doubt  —   Donald Trump is an extremely divisive candidate," Fiorina said. "That’s why he cannot win. That is why he cannot be our nominee. But honestly, Donald Trump reminds me of the Kim Kardashian of politics. They’re both famous for being famous and the media plays along.
