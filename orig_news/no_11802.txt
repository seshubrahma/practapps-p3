Aaron Blake writes in The Washington Post about the potential "nightmare scenario" facing members of the NeverTrump movement: a Trump victory. [From The Washington Post:  They assured each other he had no real shot of winning the presidency. They said he would be an embarrassment to the Republican Party and drag down the rest of the party with him, both in 2016 and for years to come. To be sure, many arguments of the   "NeverTrump" movement in the Republican Party were based on mere principle. But some were more political pleas  —   that he was bad for the party, electorally speaking, and that   doom lay ahead. It hasn’t happened  —   at least, it hadn’t as of the race’s final week. Trump appears to be within shouting distance of winning the presidency, and the Republican base is as united in voting for him (87 percent of them are behind him) as Democrats are in voting for Hillary Clinton (also 87 percent) according to Friday’s Washington   News tracking poll.
