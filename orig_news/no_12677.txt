Little    Ava could not contain her excitement when she found out she was on her way to see Donald Trump, as seen in a Facebook video posted by her parents.[  "Are you serious? !" she screamed. Her mother said yes and Ava lost it. Tears fell from her eyes as she thanked her mother. "Tell Mr. Trump you want to meet him!" said her mother. "I LOVE YOU, TRUMP! !" Ava yelled. Her father posted pictures on Facebook from the Trump rally.  Ava even made her very own Trump girl  .
