Count Colin Kaepernick as not enthused about the choices on the presidential ballot presented by the two major parties. ["You have Hillary, who has called black teens or black kids ‘super predators,’" the San Francisco 49ers quarterback said on Sunday. "You have Donald Trump, who is openly racist. We have a presidential candidate who has deleted emails and done things illegally and is a presidential candidate. That doesn’t make sense to me. If that was any other person, you’d be in prison. "  The quarterback asked, "So what is this country really standing for?" Kaepernick no longer stands for the national anthem. He debuted his disrespect on Friday before a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers. The 49ers lost the game and their quarterback lost fans. In justifying his protest during the performance of "The Star Spangled Banner," the   threat acknowledged his countrymen electing an African American president. But he requires more changes to change his stance on sitting. "It has elected a black president, but there are also a lot of things that haven’t changed," he explained about the United States. "There are a lot of issues that still haven’t been addressed, and that’s something over an   term. There’s a lot of those things that are hard to change, and there’s a lot of those things that he doesn’t necessarily have complete control over. "
