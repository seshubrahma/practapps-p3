’  ’ "   White House press secretary Sean Spicer would neither confirm nor   deny during Friday’s press briefing that President Donald Trump   has recorded audio of his private White House conversations,   including his January dinner with ousted FBI Director James   Comey.

" ’   "James Comey better hope that there are no ’’tapes’’ of our   conversations before he starts leaking to the press!" . ’ ’   The first series of questions Spicer faced in the briefing   centered around the tweet. ’ ’   "I’’ve talked to the president" about that tweet, Spicer said.
