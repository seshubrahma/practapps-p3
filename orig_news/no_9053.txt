Wednesday in Henderson, NV at a campaign rally while discussing former President Bill Clinton criticizing ObamaCare while campaigning for his wife Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said both Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama should apologize for passing and promoting the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare.  Trump said, "You know, they are always telling me if you say something, just apologize, just apologize. I think that president Obama should apologize for ObamaCare. And I think that Hillary Clinton should apologize for pursuing ObamaCare, and she wants to make it even worse than it is right now. We are going to repeal it and replace it with less expensive and much better care. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
