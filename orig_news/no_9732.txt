While acknowledging the seriousness of sexual abuse, the Media Research Center’s Dan Gainor spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Friday about the media hypocrisy behind some recent reports of allegedly inappropriate behavior by Republican nominee Donald Trump. [Gainor said, "What bothers me here is how the media became   Puritans overnight. The same people who promote debauched sex, SM, threesomes, foursomes, look at the latest episode of Westworld. They have a   foursome in it. The same media that thinks that’s great and doesn’t do anything to tear down the morality of our country, then turn around and say, ‘Oh, what this guy did was bad. ’"  "They’re not going to talk about the Kennedys," he went on, "who they think were great, when John F. Kennedy was using interns like they were party favors, Teddy Kennedy results in the death of somebody, and then he screws his way through Washington in a drunken, debauched state, and he’s the ‘Lion of the Senate. ’" You’ve got to at least be consistent. That’s a fair expectation," concluded Gainor. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
