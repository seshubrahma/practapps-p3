Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will visit Charlotte, North Carolina on Sunday, after two days of rioting in the city in response to an   police officer shooting an armed   man who refused to disarm. [The news of the visit was revealed by Clinton aide Nick Merrill, a day after Trump signaled that he was also thinking of visiting the riot stricken city.  "Trump is considering trip to Charlotte next week after Monday’s debate, I’m told," wrote CNN’s Jim Acosta on Twitter on Thursday. "Officials now looking at logistics for a visit. " In an interview with Breitbart News Daily on Friday morning, Omarosa Manigault, the director of   outreach for Donald Trump’s campaign, signaled he was considering it. "What he wants to do is to be there for Americans who feel like people have turned their backs on them. And so as long as everything logistically works out, certainly, yes, he will go visit those folks," she said of Trump’s possible Charlotte visit. But it appears that Clinton has jumped ahead of Trump’s plans, interrupting four planned days of rest and debate preparations at home. The first presidential debate is scheduled for Monday. Clinton has not made a public appearance on the campaign trail since Wednesday. Earlier today Clinton called for Charlotte law enforcement to release the video of the shooting to the public. "Charlotte should release police video of the Keith Lamont Scott shooting without delay," she wrote on Twitter. "We must ensure justice  work to bridge divides. " Earlier in the week, Clinton signaled that she was the right candidate to end the "systemic racism" in the law enforcement community. "Maybe I can by speaking directly to white people say, ‘Look this is not who we are,’" she said. "We’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. "
