’’ ’In   with Bernie Sanders surging in the polls in Iowa, The Daily Show With Trevor Noah decided it was time to formally introduce Sanders to its audience.’ ’Sanders officially declared his candidacy this past May and has been squarely in the public eye for months now, his positions, politics, unkempt hair, and Brooklyn accent dissected all over cable news and  in the land ().’ ’Still, Noah supposed its viewers "might be wondering [about] this rising new, yet old, force in the Democratic Party. "’ ’Then Noah launched into "," a relatively straightforward, jokey synopsis of Sanders’ accomplishments, from his birth in Brooklyn to his election as senator, climaxing in . "If you ask me personally," Noah said, "Bernie Sanders’ popularity has nothing to do with policy. I think it’s because he’s opposite Trump. See, the world craves balance. He’s the yin to Trump’s racist yang. "’ ’Noah concluded by pointing out that both Trump and Sanders regularly commit New York —  style assaults on the pronunciation of the word huge. The segment was a précis of Noah’s Daily Show so far: something that looks like The Daily Show, that mugs and winks like The Daily Show, but that has only a diluted point of view.’ ’If you suspect that there is something more substantial to say about Sanders than that he talks funny, The Daily Show With Jon Stewart agrees. Stewart’s Daily Show .’ ’It began with a clip reel of pundits disparaging Sanders as a whack job, as Stewart, talking fast, his voice pitched high, breathlessly ranted, "If Salvador Dalí and Dr. Seuss had a child and that child was raised by schizophrenic howler monkeys, it would be Bernie Sanders. Give me a taste of this crazy wacko cuckoo bird," throwing to a clip of a Sanders sharing his policy positions, which include pay equity for women, campaign finance reform, and expanded social security. "What a   …     rational, slightly    mainstream politician," Stewart said.’ ’"Bernie [isn’t] a   cuckoo bird, it’s that we’ve all become so accustomed to     —  driven candidates that authenticity comes across as lunacy. "’ ’’ ’’ ’Daily Show’ ’The Daily Show’ ’’ ’As we head into a presidential election totally different from any election we’ve seen before, one all but tailored for The Daily Show, there is a Daily Show —  shaped hole in the culture, despite a lesser version of the show airing every weeknight. Between Cruz’s authoritarian smarm, Hillary’s striving for the human touch, and the racist extravaganza that is Trump, American politics have never been more in need of puncturing by The Daily Show’s exasperated logic. But Noah backs away from thorny issues like they are bombs that can be defused with a charming quip. He’s out to neutralize, not to awaken. How did the program devoted to scaling bullshit mountain in all its incarnations, the program that once had a gospel choir sing "Go fuck yourself" to a Fox News correspondent, come to feel so beside the point?’ ’At its best, The Daily Show is cathartic. It has served a real sociopolitical end by dragging the most offensive, inane, and ridiculous aspects of our politics under the bright lights and laughing at them with intelligence and wit and lowbrow goofiness. The Daily Show is an activist joker, deflating gasbags and ridiculing the sanctimonious status quo, so that instead of suffering through it alone, we can laugh at it together.’ ’’ ’Stewart turned himself gray trying to rain sanity, silliness, and outrage on the hypocrisy, mendacity, and idiocy that is our political discourse. For his effort and his anger, he was rewarded with trust and love, a fake newsman who became more indispensible than a real one.’ ’Where Stewart allowed himself to be a divining rod for the news, to feel it all and lose his cool accordingly, Noah is always smooth and telegenic, easy in his manner and on the eyes, never worked up, never letting things get too dark. The  before he even took over The Daily Show seemed to presage a clumsy and unsubtle host, one who would say the wrong thing at the wrong time. But Tweetgate proved to be a red herring.’ ’Noah’s problem is not that he makes bad jokes but that he doesn’t take more chances to make great ones. All bloodless finesse, he never goes for the jugular.’ ’Consider Noah’s coverage of Obama’s recent State of the Union, in which he explained: "Typically a State of the Union is when a president lays out his agenda for the year to come," just one of the moments when The Daily Show’s attempts to expand its demographic suggest it’s imagining an audience who might know nothing about politics at all. Noah often makes toothless jokes about physical appearances, from El Chapo’s bad shirt to a guy who looked like a "wizard" at a recent Democratic debate.’ ’The sight of one bespectacled tween in the crowd during the SOTU sent Noah on a reverie about an imaginary sitcom called "Senator Kid. " It was not a particularly funny flight of fancy, and it provided no analysis of the State of the Union. As Noah reached the end of the bit, perhaps sensing that it hadn’t gone over that well, he put his charm to work, scrunching up his nose and giggling hard. "I’m sorry, I can really see the show," he shrugged.’ ’In the runup to Noah’s stewardship, The Daily Show announced that it would be moving away from its staple under Stewart: media criticism and, in particular, the relentless skewering of Stewart’s bête noir and raison d’etre, Fox News. This made sense. Stewart, with an assist from Stephen Colbert, had spent more than a decade slicing and dicing the cable news industry. His eviscerations were still widely popular with The Daily Show audience and the     crowd, but they were old news, thanks in large part to Stewart’s own work.’ ’Now, instead of covering the coverage of the news, Noah covers the news itself, but this straightforward approach places The Daily Show in a crowded field full of people who are more experienced and engaged than Noah, including Colbert, John Oliver, Larry Wilmore, and soon enough, Samantha Bee.’ ’’ ’Compare Noah’s approach to that of Wilmore, a Daily Show expat who is now the host of Comedy Central’s The Nightly Show and who has a more eggheady —  and earnest —  vibe. Last week, The Daily Show and The Nightly Show, which air back to back, both ran segments about the Flint, Michigan, water crisis, The Daily Show two nights after The Nightly Show.’ ’The segments were similar and strong. Noah took an uncharacteristically heartfelt beat to observe that "this is people’s lives," before  his punch line. Observing that the crisis could have been avoided for $100 a day, he said, "I want to call out to all my friends in Africa, because my friends, for only $100 a day, we can save a village in America," using Noah’s own biography to skewer America’s ludicrous exceptionalism.’ ’But next to Wilmore’s take on Flint, Noah’s was distant. Even when talking about something as outrageous as what happened in Flint, Noah tends to seem remote and jokey, rather than genuinely curious. making Noah’s segment look funnier and   by comparison —  until the climax. That’s when Wilmore dove furiously in. "When you have politicians fall all over each other to see who can make the most draconian budget cuts," Wilmore said, "you get decisions like this: citizens poisoned in a mania to save 100 fucking dollars a day. Officials in Flint, Michigan, should all be rounded up and put behind bars. "’ ’This sort of outraged advocacy was a staple of Stewart’s tenure on The Daily Show, and Noah does not, as of yet, seem to have it in him. How could Noah feel as passionate about the intricacies of the American political system as Jon Stewart, or any American? He just got here. Distance can be a good thing for satirists —  John Oliver, for instance, has clearly figured out how to leverage his   as a way to make his perspective on U. S. politics feel even sharper and more objective. But The Daily Show hasn’t decided whether to play up Noah’s outsider perspective or to pretend it doesn’t exist.’ ’Playing naïve has also undermined Noah in the role he seemed positioned to do best: bring his outsider status and own personal history to bear on American racial politics. On the subject of race, he’s proven himself to be an astute observer who can deliver hard truths in a brightly appealing way.’ ’His most successful bit to date was the inspired observation that Donald Trump is  which contextualizes Trump, while demystifying Africa, all while being hilarious. Noah and the writers have integrated more racial humor and commentary into the show than it had before, to say nothing of dramatically diversifying the series’ guests. Race is mentioned in nearly every episode, sometimes in unexpected ways, as in a riff about an app that can ask questions of the Founding Fathers: When Thomas Jefferson gets a look at Noah, he freaks out: "! "’ ’’ ’And yet on the subject of race, as with everything else, Noah often eases up, instead of going in. Early in his tenure, while introducing a segment called "Are All Cops Racist?" with Wood Jr. and Klepper, Noah noted that when it comes to perceptions of the police, "It really does seem like there’s no common ground. It’s as if this whole issue is just black and   …    " he tapered off, as his face lit up with an epiphany.’ ’But instead of saying the obvious "white," he proclaimed, "It’s a cookie!" On screen, an image of that deli staple, the    cookie, popped up. "The problem is a cookie," Noah said. This might be good for a dopey laugh if it were paired with some scathing analysis from Noah instead of his correspondents, but without it, it just seems embarrassingly simplistic, an empty joke.’ ’Daily Show’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’
