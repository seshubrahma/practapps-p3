Sunday on CBS’s "Face The Nation," former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said "like a lot of people," he wa not sure which version   Donald Trump "is going to walk into the Oval Office"  —   a "reality TV" star or a "business president. "  Panetta, I think like a lot of people I’m still trying to figure him out and figure out just exactly we are going to have as the new president. He’s very unconventional, and, you know, and you’re just not quite sure which Donald Trump is going to walk into the Oval Office, whether it’s the, you know, the reality TV, tweeting president, or whether it’s the business president who will be   about approaching it. So it’s really, it’s really difficult right now to try to get a sense of just exactly what the   is going to be like. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
