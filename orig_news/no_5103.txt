President Trump spoke with the children for a bit after which he stood up, thanked those gathered, and took his leave with his wife and son. Near the end of the race finish line, Attorney General Sessions and the First Lady took their turns reading books to some of the kids. Sessions read a story about a bunny that was briefly interrupted for the address from the President and First Lady, but resumed quickly thereafter. First Lady Melania read Kathie Lee Gifford’s children’s book entitled "Party Animals". Gifford’s book tells the story of a goose who finds fault with everyone she can think of to invite to her birthday party, but after seeking counsel from an owl, decides to invite everyone, differences and all.
