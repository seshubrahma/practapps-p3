 (CNN) The man dubbed "Prediction Professor" for accurately calling almost every presidential election since 1984, including the 2016 election, now forecasts the impeachment of   Donald Trump. "There’s a very good chance that Donald Trump could face impeachment," Allan Lichtman told Erin Burnett on "Erin Burnett OutFront."  Poll expert eats bug after being wrong about Trump, Lichtman, a political historian who teaches at the American University in Washington, says he uses his own system of 13 true or false statements to judge whether the incumbent party will retain the White House. However, when it came to his bold prediction of a Trump impeachment, he told Burnett it’s based on his instinct.  "First of all, throughout his life he has played fast and loose with the law," Lichtman said. "He has run an illegal charity in New York state. He has made an illegal campaign contribution through that charity. He has used the charity to settle personal business debts. He faces a RICO lawsuit." Burnett pushed back at Lichtman’s claim, noting his allegations have not been proven in a court of law and went on to ask why he thought Trump could be impeached when Republicans hold both the House and Senate.  Trump transition memo: Trade reform begins Day 1, "The Republicans are nervous about Donald Trump," Lichtman said. "He is a loose cannon. Nobody knows what he really believes or really where he stands. He can’t be controlled. The Republicans would vastly prefer to have Mike Pence, an absolutely predictable    conservative Republican."
