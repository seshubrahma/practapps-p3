Republican nominee Donald Trump renewed his attack on the media Monday morning  â€”   specifically MSNBCâ€™s Morning Joe hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough  â€”   sparking a Twitter war between Scarborough and Trump.  Trump apparently didnâ€™t like their coverage on Monday morning, although he previously had an amicable relationship with the hosts, tweeting personal attacks against Brzezinski and alleging that the two morning   were a romantic item. Tried watching   @Morning_Joe this morning,  unwatchable! @morningmika is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!  â€”   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2016,  Some day, when things calm down, Iâ€™ll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure   girlfriend, @morningmika. Two clowns!  â€”   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2016,  Trump was referencing a report about "romance chatter" between Scarborough and Brzezinski in the New York Postâ€˜s Page Six. According to CNN, Trumpâ€™s personal attack on Brzezinski comes after his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, stated that the Republican nominee doesnâ€™t use "personal insults. " Scarborough responded to Trumpâ€™s tweets Monday morning on Twitter, quoting Conway and standing up for his   Brzezinski. Neurotic and not very bright? Look in the mirror.  https:  .   â€”   Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) August 22, 2016,  Thanks for watching. Morning Joe is enjoying itâ€™s best ratings ever thanks to obsessed fans like you.
