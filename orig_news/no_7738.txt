Wednesday on ABC’s "The View"   Whoopi Goldberg said of the 2016 presidential victory of   Donald Trump had "the Russians’ fingerprints are everywhere. " Therefore, she suggested a "deal" had been in place and terms of the deal should be investigated because they pose "an endangerment to the United States. "  Goldberg said, "Let me end with this before we go to break, this is the first time a foreign power has been discussed in this fashion about our elections. The fact that people don’t seem to recognize that if there was a deal made, what is he expected to give them for this deal? These are the questions that they’ve asked about every president. They asked it about Obama, who’s he talking to, you know he’s in bed with so and so, and everybody ran with that. " "But no one seems to want to run with the fact that somehow the Russians’ fingerprints are everywhere," he continued. "So perhaps since he’s always talking about everything is rigged, we should take a minute, we should take a minute and  —   I’m trying to go faster —   take a minute and say, you know what, this is real, this is real. This is an endangerment to the United States. I think that moment should be taken. Now, we have until January 20th. There’s plenty of time. If people do their homework. If y’all don’t care, nothing is going to happen, it’s going to be fine. But this is a battle you should be fighting. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
