[The recent purge of multiple   and conservative Twitter accounts has attracted widespread coverage in the media, including criticism from non   figures including David Frum and Tim Pool.

Woods has had a long career in Hollywood, appearing in a number of acclaimed movies including Straw Dogs and Once Upon A Time In America, as well as over   plays.  Since @Twitter is now in the #censorship business, I will no longer use its service for my constitutional right to free speech. #GoodbyeAll pic. twitter.   —   James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) November 18, 2016,  Woods is a supporter of   Donald Trump and a prominent conservative voice on Twitter, boasting nearly 500K followers and millions of Twitter interactions.
