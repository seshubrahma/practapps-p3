Ahead of Donald Trump’s meeting with tech industry leaders, tech giant IBM announced that they will be hiring 25, 000 more US workers and investing $1 billion in employee development. [IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty wrote in USA Today that IBM plans to hire 25, 000 US workers over the course of the next four years, with approximately 6000 of these jobs being appointed in 2017. The company also plans to invest $1 billion in employee training and development over those four years.   ‘We are hiring because the nature of work is evolving  —   and that is also why so many of these jobs remain hard to fill," wrote Rometty. "As industries from manufacturing to agriculture are reshaped by data science and cloud computing, jobs are being created that demand new skills  —   which in turn requires new approaches to education, training and recruiting. " Rometty is a member of   Trump’s Strategic and Policy forum. The announcement from IBM came before   Trump’s meeting with members of the tech industry such as Tesla founder Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Alphabet CEO Larry Page.
