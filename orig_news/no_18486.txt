’  ’ "   Gary Cohn, President Donald Trump’s trusted economic adviser,   started his career as a trader at Goldman Sachs and wound up   becoming the bank’s president. " ’   So when Cohn on Friday said the bond market was taking a   "  view of the economy," it seemed like a startling   admission. ’ "   Either Cohn spent so long in the   that he’s forgotten how   financial markets work, or he just said bond traders weren’t   buying in to the president’s plan to make America’s economy great   again. " "   First, here’s what’s going on in the markets: Immediately after   Trump’s election, bond yields began to rise.

Cohn’s comments came as yields sank further Friday  —     after the  while downward revisions to prior months made the   picture look even bleaker.

If so, that   view is starkly at odds with   Trump’s vow to double the US economy’s growth rate. " ’   Low   interest rates suggest investors do not see value   in the economy over a prolonged period and thus see little reason   to make investments and hire workers. They also reflect the   anemic growth environment that has characterized the weakest   economic recovery in modern history  —   albeit also the longest   continuous one.   ’ "Gary Cohn, President Donald Trump’s trusted. .." ’’ ’’ ’’
