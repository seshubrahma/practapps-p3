On Friday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s "Special Report," columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that there’s no question that President Obama "was intent on leaving behind landmines. " He added that "What this is is the revenge of the losers. These are people who wanted to make trouble for an administration of a guy who they thought wasn’t going to win and shouldn’t have won, and to see what happens, and that’s what I think is going on. "  Krauthammer said, "I don’t think there’s any question the president was intent  —   the former president, was intent on leaving behind landmines. And you’re right, the NSA stuff is curious. Normally, when NSA is listening in on a foreigner, they take great care to redact any American involved. The NSA’s not supposed to spy on Americans.

These are people who wanted to make trouble for an administration of a guy who they thought wasn’t going to win and shouldn’t have won, and to see what happens, and that’s what I think is going on. To some extent, it’s happened in other administrations, but I think it’s more obvious, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it, because there are going to be a lot of investigations.
