Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stated, "The 45% tax is a threat, it was not a tax, it was a threat" regarding his proposed 45% tariff during Thursday’s Republican presidential debate on CNN.  After fellow candidate Texas Senator Ted Cruz raised Trump proposing a 45% tariff on foreign goods, Trump said, "The 45% tax is a threat, it was not a tax, it was a threat. It will be a tax, if they don’t behave.   …     The 45% is a threat, that if they don’t behave, if they don’t follow the rules and the regulations, so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn’t have to be 45%. It could be less, but it has to be something, because our country, and our trade, and our deals, and our  —   most importantly, our jobs, are going to hell.
