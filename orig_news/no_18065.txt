’  ’ ’   Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   appeared to poke fun at   President Donald Trump during a visit to the White House on   Monday, joking that he had "nothing to do with the wiretap." ’ ’   In front of reporters in the Oval Office, Trump declined to   respond to questions about wiretapping, according to a pool   report. Trump had previously accused the Obama administration of   tapping phones in Trump Tower ahead of the election. ’ ’   Abadi then grabbed Trump’’s arm and said jokingly, "We had nothing   to do with the wiretap," according to the pool report. ’ ’   In the Cabinet room after an Oval Office meeting with Abadi,   Trump commented that he hopes his Cabinet "will go down as one of   the great Cabinets of the United States" and criticized the Obama   administration’’s nuclear deal with Iran. ’ ’   "One of the things I asked him was why did President Obama sign   that agreement for Iran because nobody has been able to figure   that one out," Trump said. "Maybe someday we’’ll be able   to figure it out." ’ ’   Trump also affirmed US support for the fight against the   terrorist group ISIS and said "a lot of things are different than   they were just five or six weeks ago" in that regard. ’ ’Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   appeared. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
