Frederick Roeber, a physicist and software engineer often referred to as one of the "founding fathers of the world wide web," raised a Nazi flag over his San Francisco home to protest the election of Donald Trump. [CBS San Francisco reports that Roeber claims that he is not a Nazi nor a fascist but flew the flag in protest of the election of Donald Trump as president. In a heated exchange with a neighbour who was upset at the imagery that Roeber used, he claims that he think Trump is more like "Il Duce," referencing Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, than Hitler but that the Italians didn’t have "as good a flag" to make his point.
