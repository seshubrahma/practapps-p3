’  ’ ’   Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday will interview an individual   who accused Hillary Clinton without evidence of being a secret   "sex freak" in a recent National Enquirer article. ’ ’   The news was announced by the tabloid magazine in a press release   and . ’ ’   Last week, the National Enquirer cited an unidentified person who   claimed to be a former Clinton operative to accuse the Democratic   presidential candidate of going on "illicit romps with both men   AND women. " ’ ’   "I arranged a meeting for Hillary and a woman in an exclusive   Beverly Hills hotel," the anonymous person told the tabloid   magazine, among other things, in a sensational story not backed   up with supporting evidence. ’ ’   The National Enquirer regularly publishes bombshell claims with   no evidence to support its stories and is dismissed by most   news organizations. ’ ’’ ’   Hannity has said that he plans to do everything in his power to   help elect Clinton’s opponent, Donald Trump, president. In the   past, he has  to do so. ’ ’   A Fox News spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry about   whether Hannity giving platform to a National Enquirer subject   was in keeping with network editorial standards. ’
