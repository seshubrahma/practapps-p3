Stephen Miller, the senior policy advisor for GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, told Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon on Monday that Ohio Governor John Kasich’s support for the   Partnership trade agreement would be "signing the death warrant for Ohio manufacturing. "["John Kasich’s trade agenda and economic agenda overall is going to destroy the middle class," Miller said of the Republican candidate who is polling    with Trump in the crucial    presidential primary in Ohio tomorrow.  Kasich, Miller explained, is "proudly and energetically in support of the   Partnership. " "He’s literally signing the death warrant for Ohio manufacturing. Think about that," Miller said. "He wants to win Ohio tomorrow morning, and he’s literally saying he will sign the death warrant for Ohio’s manufacturing, which won’t just wipe out Ohio’s manufacturing jobs as we’ve discussed before, [but also] thousands of other middle class jobs that are dependent upon the manufacturing industry and driving down wages for everybody. " Miller added: "So, he will sign the death warrant for Ohio’s middle class through manufacturing destruction. And through his amnesty initiative and his pledge to have no deportations, he’s going to institute an open borders regime on America that will result in economic devastation, a national security nightmare, and the complete hollowing out of our middle class. So, John Kasich has basically become a   radical with a sheepish   routine.
