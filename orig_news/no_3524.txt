Yates wrote that, as the leader of the Justice Department, she must ensure the department’s position is both "legally defensible" and "consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. "At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful," Yates wrote. She wrote that "for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.
