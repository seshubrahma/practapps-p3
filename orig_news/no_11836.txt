Sen. Ted Cruz trails GOP frontrunner Donald Trump by only 90 delegates, Kellyanne Conway, pollster and president of the   "Keep The Promise" PAC, told Breitbart News executive chairman and host Stephen K. Bannon. ["That sounds like a lot, but it’s not, because nobody’s even at 500 yet," she said March 1 on SiriusXM Patriot 125.  Bannon asked what the state of the race would look like if Gov. John Kasich wins Ohio and Sen. Marco Rubio finishes third behind Cruz in Florida. "I think Marco Rubio should run for mayor of Miami," Conway said. "I’ll send a check. " She added: And for us and   it [would be] a whole new political ballgame   …     with your scenarios, with Kasich winning Ohio, he will go on. He will   as the person who can actually take on  —   ‘Ted’s too extreme and Donald Trump is too Trump’  —   so you have to have ‘The adult in the room,’ as he calls himself. "But that will have been the very first state John Kasich has won," she continued: And that does matter. You should win your home state. That bar should be extremely low. Especially in the case of Gov. Kasich, who won   in [his] home state by 18 points, 16 short months ago. So basically, we shrug it off  …     For Cruz, I’ve met a lot of folks who otherwise don’t have Cruz on the list right now go and support him. There are many people that want to stop Donald Trump and many of them will want to line up behind him, particularly if Kasich and Rubio are out of the race. "As the establishment goes to Cruz, remember Cruz did not go to the establishment," she said. "I think that’s the key for the voters to recognize. You got a race with [just] Donald Trump and Ted Cruz left there  —   tell me any man or any woman who would have given the odds on that a year ago. " LISTEN: Breitbart News Daily airs from 6AM to 9AM EST weekdays on SiriusXM Patriot 125.
