On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," Senator Joe Manchin ( ) stated that what he heard from President Trump’s speech before Congress was, "This man has the ability to correct the unfair trade deals that we have. I truly believe that. He understands business. He can sit down and make a deal. "  Manchin said, "[T]he things I heard last night was this: This man has the ability to correct the unfair trade deals that we have. I truly believe that. He understands business. He can sit down and make a deal. And I’ve been saying this all along  …    boy, I wish I was dealing with the united states government, what patsies they are.   …     They don’t know how to make a deal. He understands that. Can he right it? I think it’ll help an awful lot. So, some of the things that we heard last night, the family leave was great. I think he wants immigration. I think he wants a pathway forward.
