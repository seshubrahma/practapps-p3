Welcome to Breitbart News’s live updates of the 2016 horse race.   —   All times eastern. 10:45: On Fox News, Brewer says the federal government has not protected Americans from illegal immigrants and Trump will. Arpaio says Trump will "act" on illegal immigration and "finally" we’ll get something more than just talk. 10:25: Trump says the powerful "lobbies" want illegal immigration. He says Cruz is also beholden to the lobbyists who do the wrong thing for the country. Trump says he is   the campaign and could have raised five times as much as Bush if he wanted to do so. . @realDonaldTrump: "We’ve got to let our coal people be coal people. This was a great industry. We have to make [USA] energy independent."  —   Fox News (@FoxNews) March 22, 2016,  10:22: In Hannity’s town hall event, Trump says he will secure the border immediately. He notes that the border agents have his back and cites a story on the Drudge Report. He says Arpaio doesn’t get enough credit for the job he has done re: illegal immigration. . @realDonaldTrump: "Not even fair trade, I want smart trade." #Hannity pic. twitter.   —   Fox News (@FoxNews) March 22, 2016,  10:19: Sanders says it is "nonsense" that the Clinton campaign is claiming that he is polling better against Trump because he has not been vetted yet. Sanders says a lot of "crap" has been thrown against him while he was running for various offices in Vermont. Sanders says Democrats will support him and he will do better with independents who for, whatever reason, are uncomfortable with Clinton. 10:14: Trump on Fox News: . @realDonaldTrump: "I have tremendous respect for women  …    I am the least racist person." #Hannity pic. twitter.   —   Fox News (@FoxNews) March 22, 2016,  . @realDonaldTrump: "When they say they want to run against you, that means they don’t want to run against you." pic. twitter.   —   Fox News (@FoxNews) March 22, 2016,  10:11: Sanders says we should normalize relations with Cuba "in every respect," especially since Americans can go to   Arabia even though they are not democracies "but for some reason, you can’t go to Cuba. " Sanders admits Cuba is a dictatorship, but says: "Have some good things been done in Cuba, yes?" #FinalFive,  —   Zach Wolf (@zbyronwolf) March 22, 2016,  10:03: Sanders says he has shown much better judgment than Clinton on foreign policy and cites his vote against the Iraq War as proof. He blasts Clinton for praising Henry Kissinger and says he and Clinton look at foreign policy in different ways. He wants a foreign policy that works for Israel, the Palestinians and people throughout the world. He wants America to provide more economic assistance in the Middle East and do more re: water issues and the "devastation in Gaza. " He wants money to go into the region for schools, infrastructure, healthcare instead of for weapons of mass destruction. He says Israel has the right to defend itself but won’t commit to providing the same amount of foreign aid for Israel for military infrastructure. Re: Jerusalem, Sanders says "I don’t know the answer to that one as well" when asked if he believes Jerusalem should be the capital and the embassy moved to Jerusalem. 10:01: On CNN, Sanders says the security and independence of Israel must remain "in tact" but "we’ve also got to work with the Palestinians" and recognize that in Gaza, there is an unemployment rate of 44% and "people living in horrific poverty" and a community "that has been destroyed. " He says America cannot "just take the side of Israel" and he says America has not been "evenhanded" in the region and looked the other way when Israel has done "bad things. " 9:59: Trump Senior Adviser Miller on NATO: Stephen Miller, Trump campaign: "@NATO is an org. made many decades ago that is incongruent with our current foreign policy challenges."  —   Fox News (@FoxNews) March 22, 2016,  9:54: Clinton says she doesn’t hear pundits saying male candidates should smile more or are yelling too much and will "leave it at that" when Cooper asks if those criticisms are sexist. 9:51: Clinton doesn’t buy that Sanders does better against Republicans than she does. She says any horse race poll that far out is "meaningless. " The same logic should be applied to Trump’s polls. She says she has been   and that is why she is the strongest candidate. 9:48: Clinton scrambles when asked if illegal immigrants are being rewarded for breaking the law if they are allowed to stay. She says they need to pay a fine, go to the end of the line and she says she doesn’t "see the purpose" in breaking up families. 9:46: Hillary: Illegal Immigrants Should Be Able to Purchase Obamacare, On CNN, Clinton is asked whether she wants to extend Obamacare to illegal immigrants. She says illegal immigrants should be able to purchase Obamacare plans if they can afford to buy it. But she doesn’t want the subsidies to apply to illegal immigrants because that has to be worked out through comprehensive immigration reform. Chelsea overstated Hillary stance on Obamacare for undocumented immigrants. Hillary says exchanges yes, subsidies no pic. twitter.   —   Teddy Davis (@TeddyDavisCNN) March 22, 2016,    Clinton on Garland: Clinton REFUSES to say whether she would nominate Merrick Garland if she becomes president.

"  —   Betsy Klein (@betsy_klein) March 22, 2016,  POLITICO: Marco Rubio rejected ’unity ticket’ with Ted Cruz https:  .   —   Jesse Rodriguez (@JesseRodriguez) March 22, 2016,  9:31: After airing Trump’s interview that had previously aired earlier in the day, CNN is now airing Clinton’s interview with Cooper. She says "on balance" the Iran Deal was the rights step to take but the "slightest infraction" must have consequences. She says it has to be "distrust but verify. " On Donald Trump, she says he has been engaging in "bluster" and "bigotry" and there are "serious questions" about his qualifications. He says Trump would qualify as a "bully" for inciting his supporters to "go after" protesters. "Who knows?" Clinton says when Cooper asks if there is a "different Donald Trump" that she knows of. When Cooper asks if the skills used in business are the same ones involved in running government, Clinton says you have much more control over employees in a business than in government. Clinton says "in general" there is a difference and Trump’s behavior raises "questions about what he will do. " Clinton says potentially moving the U. S. Embassy to Jerusalem is something that has to be looked at in a potential   solution. She says she favors using the U. S.’s veto power in the U. N. to protect Israel. She says she was the last person who brought Netanyahu and Abbas together. She says she got more encouragement to pursue a   solution after listening to that meeting along with George Mitchell. Clinton says if Cruz moves the U. S. Embassy to Jerusalem on the first day of his presidency, that would end any chance of attaining a   solution. She says it could make things more dangerous for Israel.   8:48: Cruz says his staff and Rubio’s staff have not had any conversations about a   unity ticket. Cruz again states that he will support Trump if he becomes the nominee but insists Trump will not be the nominee. 8:47: Cruz says he will win a contested convention against Trump if Trump can’t secure enough delegates before the convention. 8:45: Cruz says he has "zero interest" in being Trump’s vice president and says Trump may be the only candidate Clinton can beat in a general election. 8:43: Cruz says every time Trump gets scared, he starts lashing out and insulting people. Cruz says Trump’s entire campaign is built on a lie. He says the lie behind Trump’s campaign is that he’ll stand up to Washington. Cruz says Trump has made millions buying influence in Washington while Clinton has made millions selling influence in Washington. [Tony Lee: People aren’t buying this argument because they think Trump knows the system and will fight for the   as fiercely as he gamed the system for himself. Will say it again —  Trump is the athlete people hate but would love to have on their team.] 8:41: Cruz says it was a "remarkable miracle" for Graham to hold a fundraiser for him after recently "calling for my murder. " He says that is a sign of Republicans uniting around his campaign because it is the only that has repeatedly beaten and can beat Trump. 8:26: Cruz says he listened to some of Trump’s speech and it is clear he hired someone to write the speech for him. Cruz says when Trump says he wants to be "neutral" re:   he is buying into the "moral equivalency" pushed by the media. Cruz says Trump is an interesting character because he can have multiple policy positions in a day. Cruz says in order to have a peace deal, the Palestinians need to recognize Israel as a Jewish State and renounce terrorism, stop paying the families of terrorists. He says   both accept "moral equivalency. " He says Trump’s knowledge of the world is limited and again dings him for referring to "Palestine. " Cruz says   won’t move the embassy to Jerusalem. Cruz says moving the embassy to Jerusalem will send a message to our friends and allies. "It makes a statement to every one of our allies that America is back," Cruz says. He says though Iran will be furious, it makes a statement to the radical Islamic terrorists that America will stand up to them and the era of appeasement under   is over. Cruz defends foreign policy adviser Frank Gaffney, and he praises Gaffney’s work fighting jihadism and potential EMP attacks. When Blitzer keeps pushing him on Gaffney’s past quotes, Cruz says he refuses to play the media’s "gotcha" game and wants to talk about issues Americans care about. He blasts Obama for sipping mojitos with Communist dictators in Cuba but not having the time to meet with dissidents. He blasts the left for glorifying "chic" dictators.   8:20: Kasich says Trump’s language re: riots is "not acceptable" but does not answer question re: whether he will call the Ohio National Guard for the convention. 8:18: Kasich blasts Romney for his robocalls. He notes that CNN’s poll found him doing the best against Clinton in the general. He says he has the   policy experience to beat Clinton. When asked about Cruz’s comments that Kasich is auditioning to be Trump’s vice president, Kasich says there is "zero" chance he will be the vice president for either. 8:15: Kasich again says he favors a path to legalization and not citizenship re: immigration. He’s given the answer about 767, 765. 46484 times this election season. And reporters keep asking him the same question. [Tony Lee: At some point, these candidate forums that the networks have to get ratings become tedious. Viewers may want to just rather watch NIT basketball, the women’s NCAA tournament or even shows like Gotham and Castle. Town hall events where regular people get to ask unscripted questions are much more compelling.] 8:02: CNN reporters are interviewing the five candidates tonight. First up is Kasich with Anderson Cooper. He says there could be some   communications that could lead to peace in the Middle East. When asked about Jerusalem being the "eternal capital" of Israel, Kasich says "take the statement for what it is. It is the eternal capital of Israel. " Kasich, responding to Trump’s comments on NATO, says we have to strengthen NATO because "we want our allies to share intelligence with us" and they have to be in the coalition that would destroy ISIS. He says he would never speak like Trump re: NATO because you have to be careful what you say as a leader. "He’s dead wrong on NATO," he says. Kasich says it was a "terrible mistake" to overthrow Qaddafi in Libya.   8:00: Joel Pollak’s grades for all of the candidates at AIPAC. 7:28: According to one reporter, crowd more enthusiastic about Trump than Cruz: Ted Cruz just gave a     speech to AIPAC, and he got less applause than Donald Trump did.

Cruz also says he will reimpose sanctions on Iraq on the first day he is in office. 7:09: Cruz blasts Clinton for once saying that Hamas puts rockets in schools because Gaza is "densely populated. " Cruz also immediately pronounces Purim correctly, as crowd cheers compared to Clinton’s flub earlier in day,  —   Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) March 21, 2016,  7:05: Cruz on Graham fundraiser: Cruz:Lindsey Graham hosted fundraiser for me today, which should "allay any doubts that God of Abraham, Isaac  Jacob can still do miracles"  —   Jessica Taylor (@JessicaTaylor) March 21, 2016,  Graham hosted a fundraiser for Cruz at Clyde’s, the bar next door to the Verizon Center, raised more than $200, 000 per fundraising source,  —   Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) March 21, 2016,  7:03: Cruz, taking a shot at Trump and echoing George Will’s criticism, opens his speech by saying that Palestine has not existed since 1948. Unfortunate time slot for Ted Cruz. Lots of empty seats now. #AIPAC2016,  —   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) March 21, 2016,  6:53: Trump calls Hamas the "Palestinian ISIS" and says we will move our embassy to Jerusalem ("eternal capital"). "And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between American and our most reliable ally, the state of Israel," he says. Trump says the Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is "absolutely, totally unbreakable. " Trump says Palestinians must come to the table willing to stop the terror that is committed daily against Israel. He says they also must accept that Israel is a Jewish state and will forever exist as a Jewish state. Establishment and media must eat crow. No boos for Trump. No mass walkouts. #AIPAC2016,  —   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) March 21, 2016,  Before: Watch! Trump will fail!

" He says there is no "moral equivalency" because Israel does not name public squares after terrorists and Israel does not pay Palestinians to stab random Israelis. He says what Obama gets wrong about dealmaking is he puts pressure on our friends and rewards our enemies. 6:47: Trump says when he becomes president, the days of treating Israel like a "  citizen will end on day one. " He says "and when I say something, I mean it. " Trump says he will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. He says he has known him for many years and he will work with him to bring peace to Israel and the entire region. Trump says there are children being taught every day to hate Israel and the Jews. "It has to stop," he says. "When  you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the  heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. We can’t let this continue. " Trump says you can’t have peace when martyrs are treated as heroes. 6:44: Trump says you can’t reward terror and "there’s only one way you treat that kind of behavior —  you have to confront it. " He also says a U. N. peace deal would "delegitimize" Israel and he would veto any U. N. deal that would impose its will on the Jewish state. Looks like @realDonaldTrump is killing it at #AIPAC.

" 6:37: Trump says as president, America will stand up to Iran’s aggressive push to destabilize the Middle East and dominate the region. Trump says Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states "literally every day. " Trump says we will "totally dismantle Iran’s global terror network," which is "big and powerful" but "not powerful like us. " Trump says we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold Iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like "we’ve never seen a contract enforced before. Believe me. " Trump says "Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth" is painted on missiles in  . He asks "what kind of demented" minds would write that in Hebrew? 6:34: Trump says the Iran Deal is "catastrophic" for America, Israel, and the whole of the Middle East. Trump says we have rewarded the world’s top sponsor of terror with $150 billion without receiving anything in return. He says Iran just wants to run out the clock while keeping the billions we "so foolishly gave them. " Now @realDonaldTrump wants to "dismantle" #Irandeal.

He says his no. 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. 6:29: Trump takes the stage at AIPAC. He says "I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel.

" He says Kelly and Roger Ailes want him on her show for a "primetime special" so badly. He says Kelly should give Trump half of her salary because she has been elevated after attacking him. 5:32: Trump says Megyn Kelly attacks him every night and her ratings would plummet if she didn’t criticize him. She says the show is a negative infomercial about him. "Not fair," he says. "I will fight back on Twitter  …     and let people know she’s a   talent. " Trump says if Kelly didn’t talk about him, her "ratings would go down like a rock. " 5:30: When asked if his language re: women will come back to haunt him, he says half of it was "show business.
