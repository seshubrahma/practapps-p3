Speaking to reporters on Monday night, Texas Republican Senator and   GOP candidate for president Ted Cruz reported that he voted a straight Republican ticket. [Cruz made his October 31 remark after exiting the   center on West Grey in Houston, Texas. He said he had just voted and "cast a ballot" for GOP nominee Donald Trump, Houston’s KHOU reported.  He also urged all conservatives to do the same. "I encourage conservatives to come out all across Houston, all across the State of Texas," Cruz told reporters. "It’s all about turnout and that’s why [we] need people to come out and vote," Cruz added. "It’s why I voted early. You beat the lines on Election Day and you make your voice count. " Senator Cruz isn’t the only high profile Republican to reveal for whom, they have voted. House Speaker Paul Ryan also noted that he voted for Donald Trump in Wisconsin’s early voting period. When asked on Fox News who he was supporting, the Republican House Speaker said, "I stand where I stood all fall and all summer. In fact, I already voted here in Janesville for our nominee last week in early voting. " But not every former GOP candidate for president is supporting Trump. Ohio Governor John Kasich made quite a show of claiming he wrote in John McCain’s name for president instead of voting for the GOP nominee.
