WASHINGTON D. C. March 11, 2016  —   Breitbart News Network CEO and President Larry Solov released the following statement in response to statements made by Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump attacking Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields:  Breitbart News stands behind Michelle Fields. Even Donald Trump campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson said Thursday that "someone probably did grab her," i. e. Fields, though she claimed it could not have been Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Trump’s suggestion that Fields made up the incident Tuesday evening contradicts the evidence, including her own injuries, an account from Washington Post reporter Ben Terris, and audio recorded at the scene.  —   Breitbart CEO Larry Solov says company stands by Michelle Fields as Trump campaign dismisses allegation: pic. twitter.   —   Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) March 11, 2016,
