On Thursday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( ) told reporters that Donald Trump’s nomination would help Republicans running for office, not hurt them. [McCarthy cited the fact that turnout in the first nine presidential primaries had risen this year from 2008, while Democratic turnout had declined.  McCarthy used the example of the 7th District, where Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones is challenging   Democrat Rep. Ami Bera, telling to the Sacramento Bee, "I have big hopes that that one is going to be very competitive. " Jones has made immigration one of his top issues: last October, after an illegal immigrant murdered a Sacramento County sheriff’s deputy and a Placer County sheriff’s deputy, Jones made a YouTube video in which he called on Barack Obama to push for "meaningful immigration reform. " McCarthy also cited the possibility of Republicans challenging Fresno Democrat Jim Costa, San Diego Democrat Scott Peters, and the seat in Santa Barbara held by Lois Capps, who is retiring after almost 20 years serving the area. McCarthy opined, "They’ve got a challenge inside the Democratic Party right now. Look at Bernie (Sanders) coming back in Michigan. There’s a low intensity level for Hillary (Clinton). " He said Americans are frustrated with Barack Obama, adding, "They are at the point now that they want to lash out. "
