Updated, 10:34 a. m. Good morning on this temperate Tuesday. Apparently, we could all up our recycling game. First, less than half of what we could recycle ends up in our city’s recycling programs, according to a report published last month by the city’s Independent Budget Office. Second, much of what we do try to recycle gets thrown into the wrong bins. "This makes recycling more expensive, and it makes what’s actually recyclable less valuable," said Daniel Huber, an environmental analyst with the budget office. For those New Yorkers who have successfully avoided taking the trash to the curb, a quick primer. The Sanitation Department has three main streams for the city’s unwanted stuff  —   one for garbage destined for a landfill, one to recycle paper, and one to recycle metal, glass and plastic. According to the July report, which used Sanitation Department data from 2013, only about a quarter of aluminum cans  —   one of the most valuable recyclable metals  —   makes it into the right bin. And only around 5 percent of our plastic cups, plates and utensils goes to the right place. We do the best job recycling glass, but as it turns out, that’s one of the least valuable types of commodities, Mr. Huber said  —   far less useful than recycled metal and paper. So what can we do to make recycling less painful for us and more efficient for those processing it? "Being more diligent about making sure stuff doesn’t end up in the wrong recycling stream is the key one," Mr. Huber told us. Think twice about where your child’s dirty diapers and juice boxes are thrown. Before the    season, recycle last year’s notebooks. (And even electronics.) Don’t scavenge. And take the time to understand what newer recycling categories are being accepted around the city, Mr. Huber added.
