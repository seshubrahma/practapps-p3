Sorry, I was on Twitter. I felt it was necessary to dispel the   myth, adored by #NeverTrumpers, that somehow attacking Trump relentlessly does not aid Hillary Clinton, and that they are not choosing Hillary Clinton by choosing to be NeverTrump. All choices have consequences. By supporting Trump, I am responsible for the consequences of a Trump victory  —   and those consequences could indeed be dire. But a childish   fantasy has infected the #NeverTrump    that they can agitate for Hillary Clinton  —   by relentlessly disparaging Trump  —   and somehow, they are not responsible for the consequences of the Hillary presidency they are bucking for. They’ve dreamed up this     dreamscape in which those who plump for Trump are responsible for the outcomes of a Trump presidency, but, for no explanation thus far discoverable, they are not responsible for the outcomes of the Hillary presidency they’re agitating for. You can read the rest of the story here.
