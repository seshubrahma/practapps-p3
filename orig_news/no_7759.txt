Nearly 10, 000 voters chanted "CNN sucks" during a campaign rally for Donald Trump in Pennsylvania Monday night. ["I’m telling you, they are so dishonest. Without the media, Hillary Clinton couldn’t be elected dog catcher," Trump stated. "CNN is a disgrace.

(@ASwoyer) October 11, 2016,  The Republican nominee then alleged that CNN turned off its camera as he was criticizing the network. "I love WikiLeaks," Trump proclaimed, while bashing his opponent Hillary Clinton during the campaign rally in   Pennsylvania with nearly 10, 000 people, according to Fox News, at the Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza. WikiLeaks has been slowly revealing controversial emails from Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta. "Crooked Hillary Clinton said that terrorism is not a threat to the nation," Trump read from a piece of paper to the crowd, saying she made that comment during a paid speech behind closed doors. "Let me tell you, terrorism is a big threat," Trump declared. "Hillary admitted that ISIS could infiltrate with the refugees. " Trump also referenced an email about Benghazi from Sidney Blumenthal, whom he called, "sleazy Sidney. " "The attack was almost certainly preventable. Clinton was in charge of the State Department," Trump stated, reading from his notes on the email. "If the GOP wants to raise that as a talking point against her, it is legitimate. " Trump claimed she is now admitting they could have done something about Benghazi. The crowd booed in reaction and chanted, "Lock her up!" "What a group we have!" Trump responded.
