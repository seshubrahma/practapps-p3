Fresh off his second place finish in Iowa, GOP national frontrunner Donald Trump upped his   rhetoric at a rally tonight in Milford, New Hampshire. ["If we are attacked, somebody attacks us, wouldn’t you rather have Trump as president if we’re attacked?" Trump said. "Oh, we’ll beat the sh*t out of them. "  "And speaking of potential  —   because he hates Obama so much  —   Putin, he said ‘Donald Trump is a genius,’ and he’s the real leader over in that country," Trump said. "I’m not disavowing that he called me genius, are you crazy? Don’t worry, I can’t be seduced," he added. Trump urged better relations with Russia. "But wouldn’t it be nice  …     if we actually got along with Russia and others, and we can use them to knock out ISIS with us so that maybe we don’t always have to pay for it  …     Knock the hell out of them, but let them drop some of their bombs that cost $1 million apiece. Let them use some of their weapons that cost billions of dollars," Trump said. "Let them beat the sh*t out of ISIS also, right? Right?" he added. Watch video of his comments below:
