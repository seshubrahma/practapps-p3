This week on "Saturday Night Live," Kate McKinnon as Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway brought in "Breaking Bad" character Walter White, played by actor Bryan Cranston, as Head of DEA for Trump’s cabinet.  Beck Bennett in the role of CNN’s Jake Tapper asked White where Trump chief strategist and former Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon found him, which he replies, "Under the comments section at Breitbart. " Asked if he knows anything about drug enforcement, White, a drug manufacturer and dealer on "Breaking Bad," says, "Trust me, I know the DEA better than anyone, inside and out. " White says he likes Trump’s "style," and agrees with the border wall because it will mean less competition for the drug dealer. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
