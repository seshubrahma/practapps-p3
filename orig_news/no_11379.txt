NBC, CBS and ABC spent 21 minutes Friday morning covering GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s boycott of the Fox News GOP primary debate, "while only managing 7 minutes for the GOP contenders who participated in the event," according to the Media Research Center. [Media Research Center’s Kyle Drennen analyzed the morning television news coverage from the three networks and found:  While heavily skewed toward Trump, CBS provided the most balanced air time, giving the missing GOP frontrunner 8 minutes 30 seconds while providing 5 minutes 12 seconds to the debate. Both NBC and ABC had nearly identical slanted coverage. Today gave Trump 6 minutes 2 seconds versus 1 minute 8 seconds to the debate. GMA had 6 minutes 31 seconds for Trump and only 1 minute 23 seconds for the debate. Instead of attending the GOP debate, Trump held a fundraiser for veterans where he raised six million dollars, according to the Trump campaign.
