Pop star and outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter Katy Perry stripped down to her birthday suit to head to the ballot box in a new voter registration PSA produced by liberal comedy website Funny or Die. ["Hi. Iâ€™m Katy Perry. You know, November 8th is Election Day, and Iâ€™ve got some great news. This year, you can look like sh*t when you vote," the    pop singer says in the   clip, released Tuesday to coincide with National Voter Registration Day.   "Yup, Iâ€™ve briefly scanned the Constitution, and nowhere does it say you canâ€™t just roll out of bed and come to the polls in whatever state you woke up in," a cheerful Perry says as she strolls into a ballot box. Perry points to others who have showed up to vote in various states of undress, including those in "childâ€™s onesies" and that "hunk in kidâ€™s briefs," before stripping down to cast her own vote. "Or, if youâ€™re like me  â€¦     I sleep naked," Perry says before shedding her clothes, causing at least one man behind her to faint. "Let those babies loose. " Perry, along with many of her fellow celebrities, took to Twitter to   Monday nightâ€™s first presidential debate between Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump. The singer enthusiastically cheered on Clinton.
