Sunday on ABC’s "This Week," former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said the demonstrations over the election are being carried out by "professional protesters," not "Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama supporters. "  Giuliani said, "I feel very bad about that, but if those were Donald Trump people doing that after a Hillary Clinton election, I think a lot of people would be  —   a lot more anger in the media at the fact that they’re protesting a legitimately decided election. Having said that, I think we understand their frustration. We certainly don’t want to make it worse. I think they’re exaggerating the fears of a Donald Trump presidency because they’re coming off a campaign where they’re very disappointed. I’m sure our supporters would have been very disappointed had Donald Trump not won. And I just hope it is calming down. Now where it goes into violence, I have a zero tolerance for riots. " He continued, "You know, I want to amendment my statement a little bit. I’m not sure these are even Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama supporters. I think these people are, you know, kind of like professional protesters more. they didn’t look to me like  …    they didn’t look to me like people who were, you know, carefully studying political science and were all upset about, you know, the ideology of the election.
