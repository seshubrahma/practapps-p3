" 11:43 PM  —   Republican nominee Donald Trump is projected to win Iowa’s 6 electoral votes, beating his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton by a large enough margin that several networks have called the race with less than two thirds of ballots counted.  Iowa was considered a key battleground state headed into Tuesday’s election. Located in the influential Midwestern region and known for holding the first primary in the nation, Iowa was long considered a Republican stronghold until the state went blue in both 2008 and 2012 for President Barack Obama. Chuck Grassley has also won reelection for a seventh term, saving his Senate seat from Democratic challenger and former lieutenant governor Patty Judge. Grassley was predicted to win despite heavy criticism from Democrats for his blockage of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.

In the battle for the Senate, two of the nine races most likely to decide control have been called, one for Republicans and one a pickup for the Democrats  —   the first of five they will need to win an outright majority. GOP Sen. Marco Rubio won   to his seat in Florida, a race he entered late, only after his presidential campaign faltered. And Tammy Duckworth, the Democratic Illinois congresswoman, defeated incumbent GOP Sen. Mark Kirk in a race that was widely predicted would hand Democrats one of the seats they were looking for. The map for the Senate favored Democrats this year, with all but one of nine seats most likely to decide the balance being held by Republicans. The nine races where a seat is open or most likely to change hands were in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Nevada, Florida and Indiana. Of that group, seven seats belong to Republican incumbents trying to hang on. Only two are open seats, Indiana and Nevada. The only one in Democratic hands presently is Nevada, where Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is retiring. Coming into Tuesday, the House seemed a much safer bet for Republicans  —   and the election night tallies proved true. The GOP held an enormous   advantage coming into Tuesday. The   Cook political report listed 18 seats as pure tossups, not enough to flip control of the chamber to Democrats, even if they ran the table in all of them. 9:45 PM  —   Trump projected to win Louisiana. 9:43 PM  —   Trumpmentum.

Kelly said he met a woman in Clinton Township who tried to vote three different times for Donald Trump, but her vote mysteriously switched to Hillary Clinton each time before the voting machine’s screen went blank. She has no idea if her vote was counted and was very upset by the process. There are 18 different polling sites that have had similar problems taking place, Kelly said. The state party is looking into the discrepancies. If votes are only being flipped one way, "it’s a computer fix, not a computer glitch," Kelly said. Concerned voters can call the GOP hotline:     Kelly said. Calling the hotline if anything worrying occurs is key, Kelly said, and so is reviewing the vote you cast: Voters "have to look at the [ballot] summary to make sure it’s exactly the way you voted. " "We’re hearing these things are changing, and it’s all one way," Kelly said. "You can say, well, maybe it was a computer glitch, but it’s all people voting for Trump. And it’s defaulting to Clinton. " 6:38 PM  —   O’Keefe says another video imminent. WOW! Caught more #VoterFraud in N Philly.

In 2012, Mitt Romney won the same group  —   but by a lower margin, Politico reports.  Other interesting tidbits mentioned by Politico include that "more voters say Clinton is honest and trustworthy (38 percent) than describe Trump as honest and trustworthy (32 percent). " It is not clear whether exit polls are accurate  —   and, given Trump voters’ hostility to media and pollsters, they may be even less accurate than usual.

Mountain Standard Time, and was reported fixed about 3:30 p. m. according to local Denver station Fox 31 and the Secretary of State’s office.  Fox 31 reports: "Unfortunately, our system goes down now and then. It [happened] today and we regret that," Lynn Bartels, spokeswoman for the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office said on Twitter. The database is used to confirm voter registration. While the system was down, clerks couldn’t process   ballots that needed to have the signature verified and people voting in person voters had to use provisional ballots, according to Bartels.  The news of the crash is likely to fuel speculation of outside tampering or "hacking," especially given Colorado’s status as an important battleground state, where both campaigns have spent time and resources. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had initially pulled advertising from Colorado, but put resources back into the state as it became more competitive again, and as Republican nominee Donald Trump campaigned there. 5:51 PM  —   The March presidential primary already shattered a   record with 2. 5 million voters.

Detroit polling places reported "disorganization," ballot outages, and frustrated voters giving up and leaving. One Detroit voter was unable to leave a polling place on the east side of the city, because his hand got stuck in a voting machine. However, Johnson said of overall performance by voting machines: "So far, so good.

Local Republicans have taken to social media @PhillyGOP to share their accounts with the nation in  .  A small sampling of these tweets (with "minority inspector" referring to Republican inspectors) just from the morning hours of Election Day include: Most of these tweets were tagged with #VoterFraud. Political analysts sometimes say that Pennsylvania is "Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Alabama," meaning that there are two Democratic strongholds in the Keystone State, surrounded by vast expanses of   support for limited government, faith, marriage, and the Second Amendment. Philadelphia is nothing short of notorious for voter fraud. One of the most infamous examples of   violations in modern history was when The Justice Department secured a court judgment against the Black Panthers for a videotaped incident of voter intimidation, a case that after the government won but before enforcement could take place, Barack Obama’s   Attorney General Eric Holder to drop the case and let the Black Panthers go. Some polls are split regarding whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is likely to win Pennsylvania, with Republicans complaining that voter fraud is so rampant in Philadelphia that it could steal a victory from Donald Trump if the margin is close. Trump has been pounding away on the theme that aspects of the system are "rigged" urging his supporters to turn out in massive numbers to ensure victory when the polls close.

And Trump has had some unkind things to say about George W. Bush," Limbaugh explained, referencing Donald Trump’s habit during the Republican primary of calling Jeb Bush "low energy. "   "But aside from that, think about party loyalty, think about issues, think about the direction of the country," Limbaugh added. "How does anybody vote for Hillary Clinton?" Limbaugh issued a stern warning to the "elites in Washington and New York," members of the "club" of powerful,   political and media figures. "I submit to you that if you’re in the club, and by the club I mean the establishment, if you are among the few elites in Washington and New York that actually, for lack of a better term, run the country, you’re going to hang together with other club members," Limbaugh said. "That’s how I think this happens. " "Hillary Clinton’s not seen as a Democrat  …     She may be, on one intramural level, an opponent, but she’s certainly not an enemy when somebody outside the club happens to be running," Limbaugh continued. "Members of the club   …     they’re going to hang together to preserve the existence of the club and its exclusivity. " Although as many as 50 former George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush administration appointees coming out in support of Trump, there were reports earlier this year that George W. Bush would vote for Hillary Clinton.  3:50 PM  —   SYMBOLISM.

"  The Trump campaign also submitted a letter to the Nevada Secretary of State calling for an investigation into the "egregious violations of Nevada election law by Mr. Gloria. " The lawsuit is focused on early voting in specific locations in Clark County on the last day of early voting, Friday. Voters who get in line before the polling locations’ closing times are allowed to vote, but the Trump campaign’s lawsuit alleges poll workers at the direction of Gloria allowed people who did not get in the line before the polls had closed. Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston described one of the locations in a Politico article published before the lawsuit. The line Friday evening stretched outside Cardenas Market in Las Vegas, teeming with Hispanic voters eager to cast ballots. Many had to wait for hours on the last day of a fortnight of early voting in Nevada, plied by food and exhortations from activists who didn’t have to do much. Election officials had to keep the polling place open an extra three hours to accommodate the line, which was described thusly on Twitter by Yvanna Cancela, the political director for the majority Hispanic Culinary union: "Looks like Trump got his wall after all.

Democrats were more likely than Republicans to place more value in whether the candidate cares about them (20 percent to 12 percent) while GOP voters said it was more important that the candidate shares their values (19 percent to 14 percent). Morning Consult, which was founded in 2013, is considered the "breakout" polling company of the 2016 election. 1:02 PM  —   "  turnout is looking much higher than expected," Luntz tweeted.  BREAKING: Watch Michigan.   turnout is looking much higher than expected.

W. Bush took the White House while riding on the popularity of outgoing president Ronald Reagan. Hillary Clinton has maintained an edge in Michigan polling heading into Election Day, with the RealClearPolitics polling average putting her 3. 4 percentage points above Trump  —   within most polls’ margins of error. An   survey published by the Trafalgar Group showed Trump up two points. Michigan native Michael Moore warned his progressive followers last week that polls showing Clinton ahead were not a guarantee that she would win the state  —   as Sen. Bernie Sanders pulled off an upset victory during the Democratic primary despite trailing her by large margins. On the morning of the MI primary this year, these were the pollsters predictions. 12 hrs later Bernie won. #WAKEUP pic. twitter.   —   Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 31, 2016,  Trump has campaigned aggressively in the Midwestern state, holding his final campaign rally with running mate Mike Pence in Grand Rapids. And Democratic rival Hillary Clinton appears nervous about her performance in the state, spending six figures on ads there and making several campaign stops  —   including an appearance by President Barack Obama. Trump has made an appeal to   voters with a promise to revitalize U. S. manufacturing through better trade deals, attacking Clinton over the legacy of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and her early support of the   Partnership (TPP). In an ironic moment, Moore  —   famous for his film Roger  Me about the closing of a General Motors plant in Flint, MI  —   inadvertently created a viral ad explaining the reason many   voters are supporting Trump. An excerpt of his film TrumpLand, where he discusses Trump’s   appeal, received millions of views as Trump supporters set it to dramatic music and images.  12:26 PM  —    12:04 PM  —   Pence lives and votes in Indianapolis as he lives at the Indiana governor’s mansion.

Trump voted shortly after 11 a. m. local time in New York. After voting, Trump "chatted with some people at the polls and   some kids there.

"So risk of a polling error  —   in either direction  —   is higher than usual. "  2) Undecideds are MUCH higher than normal. So risk of a polling error  —   in either direction  —   is higher than usual. pic. twitter.   —   Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) November 8, 2016,  One out of eight voters, or 12. 5 percent, are either undecided or declaring support for other candidates during the last few days of the election. That is up from one out of 32 voters in 2012, one out of 27 voters in 2004, and one out of 10 voters in 2000, when Texas Gov. George W. Bush barely beat Vice President Al Gore. So Silver is cautioning people to be ready for a major failure by the pollsters in predicting Americans’   choices. Clinton is likely to win, said Silver, but: 3) Basically, these 3 cases are equally likely, a —  Solid Clinton win, b —  Epic Clinton blowout, c —  Close call, Trump *probably* wins Elect. Coll. If the polls understate Trump’s support by three percent by a uniform margin of three percent, Clinton still wins, although just barely, Silver said.  However, in a prior tweet, Silver noted that Trump is doing much better than 2012 Republican candidate Gov. Mitt Romney in the midwestern states, where he may be able to pick up wins that would give him 270 Electoral votes. But mostly it’s the Electoral College. Clinton underperforming Obama’s 2012 forecast by *4 points* in the Midwest. That’s a major liability. pic. twitter.   —   Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) November 7, 2016,  Other evidence, described by Breitbart here and here, suggest that the 2016 polls are less reliable predictors than prior years’ of the final presidential vote. Also,   support for Clinton may be sharply down from support for President Barack Obama in 2016. 11:41 AM  —   He went on to claim the organisation had no political bias against Hillary Clinton but could not "publish information we do not have" on the campaigns of Donald Trump and   candidates.  Assange added that the policy position he has supported is that of Green Party candidate Jill Stein, as she has expressed desire to protect whistleblowers and maintained that WikiLeaks’ work should be explicitly protected by the First Amendment. You can read the full statement below: "In recent months, WikiLeaks and I personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the Clinton campaign says about itself to itself. That pressure has come from the campaign’s allies, including the Obama administration, and from liberals who are anxious about who will be elected US President. On the eve of the election, it is important to restate why we have published what we have. The right to receive and impart true information is the guiding principle of WikiLeaks  —   an organization that has a staff and organizational mission far beyond myself. Our organization defends the public’s right to be informed. This is why, irrespective of the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election, the real victor is the US public which is better informed as a result of our work. The US public has thoroughly engaged with WikiLeaks’ election related publications which number more than one hundred thousand documents. Millions of Americans have poured over the leaks and passed on their citations to each other and to us. It is an open model of journalism that gatekeepers are uncomfortable with, but which is perfectly harmonious with the First Amendment. We publish material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere. When we have material that fulfills this criteria, we publish. We had information that fit our editorial criteria which related to the Sanders and Clinton campaign (DNC Leaks) and the Clinton political campaign and Foundation (Podesta Emails).   disputes the public importance of these publications. It would be unconscionable for WikiLeaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election. At the same time, we cannot publish what we do not have. To date, we have not received information on Donald Trump’s campaign, or Jill Stein’s campaign, or Gary Johnson’s campaign or any of the other candidates that fufills our stated editorial criteria. As a result of publishing Clinton’s cables and indexing her emails we are seen as domain experts on Clinton archives. So it is natural that Clinton sources come to us. We publish as fast as our resources will allow and as fast as the public can absorb it. That is our commitment to ourselves, to our sources, and to the public. This is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election. The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers. I spoke at the launch of the campaign for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, because her platform addresses the need to protect them. This is an issue that is close to my heart because of the Obama administration’s inhuman and degrading treatment of one of our alleged sources, Chelsea Manning. But WikiLeaks publications are not an attempt to get Jill Stein elected or to take revenge over Ms Manning’s treatment either. Publishing is what we do. To withhold the publication of such information until after the election would have been to favour one of the candidates above the public’s right to know. This is after all what happened when the New York Times withheld evidence of illegal mass surveillance of the US population for a year until after the 2004 election, denying the public a critical understanding of the incumbent president George W Bush, which probably secured his reelection. The current editor of the New York Times has distanced himself from that decision and rightly so. The US public defends free speech more passionately, but the First Amendment only truly lives through its repeated exercise. The First Amendment explicitly prevents the executive from attempting to restrict anyone’s ability to speak and publish freely. The First Amendment does not privilege old media, with its corporate advertisers and dependencies on incumbent power factions, over WikiLeaks’ model of scientific journalism or an individual’s decision to inform their friends on social media. The First Amendment unapologetically nurtures the democratization of knowledge. With the Internet, it has reached its full potential. Yet, some weeks ago, in a tactic reminiscent of Senator McCarthy and the red scare, Wikileaks, Green Party candidate Stein, Glenn Greenwald and Clinton’s main opponent were painted with a broad, red brush. The Clinton campaign, when they were not spreading obvious untruths, pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with Russia. The campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications —  because none exists. In the end, those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them  —   a reason for censorship the First Amendment cannot tolerate. Only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate. WikiLeaks’   pristine record for authentication remains. Our key publications this round have even been proven through the cryptographic signatures of the companies they passed through, such as Google. It is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them. We have endured intense criticism, primarily from Clinton supporters, for our publications. Many   supporters have been frustrated because we have not addressed this criticism in a systematic way or responded to a number of false narratives about Wikileaks’ motivation or sources. Ultimately, however, if WL reacted to every false claim, we would have to divert resources from our primary work. WikiLeaks, like all publishers, is ultimately accountable to its funders. Those funders are you. Our resources are entirely made up of contributions from the public and our book sales. This allows us to be principled, independent and free in a way no other influential media organization is. But it also means that we do not have the resources of CNN, MSNBC or the Clinton campaign to constantly rebuff criticism. Yet if the press obeys considerations above informing the public, we are no longer talking about a free press, and we are no longer talking about an informed public. Wikileaks remains committed to publishing information that informs the public, even if many, especially those in power, would prefer not to see it. WikiLeaks must publish. It must publish and be damned. 11:29 AM  —   WABC, an ABC affiliate, reports the two women were arrested.

If those two measures pass, half of all Americans would live in states that have such expanded checks. Eighteen states and Washington, D. C. have already approved similar laws. (Graphic: Gun issues on the ballot here) Voters in Washington state, meanwhile, will consider allowing judges to bar people from possessing guns if they pose a danger to themselves or to others, such as accused domestic abusers. In California, a referendum would ban   ammunition magazines and require certain people to pass a background check to buy ammunition.

These   voters are proud to have the first word on the big vote.  Clinton won more votes in Dixville and Hart’s Location, but Trump was the overwhelming favorite in Millsfield, with a   edge. Libertarian Gary Johnson picked up three votes. Bernie Sanders, John Kasich and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney got   votes. Under New Hampshire state law, communities with fewer than 100 voters can get permission to open their polls at midnight and close them as soon as all registered voters have cast their ballots. 10:08 AM  —   From the New York Post:  Moody’s Analytics, which has picked the next president every year since 1980, says Clinton will make history as the first female chief executive, trouncing Trump with 332 electoral votes. That runs in sharp contrast to a model created by Helmut Norpoth, a political science professor at Stony Brook University, that’s predicting Trump will be running the country. Norpoth is sticking by the results of his model  —   which has correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election since 1912, with the exception of 2000  —   despite most polls showing Clinton ahead by at least 3 percentage points. "If [Clinton] was leading by 10 or 20 points, I would say this is not going to be my year, but I don’t see it," he told The Post. "It’s so close. It’s certainly   [for him] even when you look at the polls.
