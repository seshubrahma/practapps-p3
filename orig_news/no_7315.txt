["I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people’s lives," Ryan said in an   in his hometown paper. "That’s why I’ll be voting for him this fall. "  Ryan released his   right before Clinton took the stage for her foreign policy speech in which she condemned Trump’s credentials on national security. The essay focused primarily on the House Republican agenda, arguing that he had a lot planned for a government led by a Republican president. Ryan admitted that although he was uncertain about supporting Trump, meeting him in person to discuss policy made him more comfortable about the decision. Ryan added that the House Republican vision would be "a positive, optimistic vision for a more confident America. " "It’s no secret that he and I have our differences," he said. "I won’t pretend otherwise. And when I feel the need to, I’ll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement. " Ryan also took a stand against Hillary Clinton. "A Clinton White House would mean four more years of liberal cronyism and a government more out for itself than the people it serves," she said. "Quite simply, she represents all that our agenda aims to fix. "
