Most members of the Main Stream Media like to think of themselves as  .  And so, as part of their mellow feelings toward the planet,   enjoy shopping at Whole Foods indeed, many are so refined in their thinking that they are vegans.  So of course they support gun control, oppose the death penalty and the Pentagon budget, and pride themselves on voting for  "peace" candidates.  And yet when it comes right down to it, in their own line of work, they are plenty militant, even warlike.  And that goes double if the target is Donald Trump. [First of Two Parts  …        Yes, if Trump is in the picture, then journos easily slip into the language, and the thinking, of combat and war.  This makes sense, because, for better or for worse, the vocabulary of fighting suffuses everyday speech, and "nice" reporters are no exception.  In particular, when humans wish to organize themselves to do something, they tend to adopt military forms the word "campaign," for example, was used to describe military operations long before it was used to describe political operations. A case in point is the headline that appeared in the   of the January 13 edition of The New York Times: "Outgunned, Outmaneuvered and in Need of a Game Plan. "  Later, perhaps at the prodding of   groups, that headline was softened to, "As Trump Berates News Media, a New Strategy Is Needed to Cover Him"  Still, the word "strategy" is there in the header, reaching, as it does, deep into military history.  Could Trump really be doing all that?  It sure looks that way.  After all, if the MSM is waging war on Trump, Trump is also waging war on the MSM.  Indeed, we might add, Trump is doing a better job —  he’s winning.  And why is he winning?  Because he’s smarter and tougher.  Most obviously, there’s Trump’s Twitter feed, which now numbers 20 million followers.  As he has said, possessing an audience that big is like owning The New York Times, only without the financial losses.  Moreover, including all forms of social media, his audience totals some 50 million.  And yet even that big number understates his impact, because his messages always echo in the news.  It’s fair to say that even before Trump is inaugurated as president, he has proven that when he wants to get a point across, everyone in the country gets it.    So here we might be tempted to interpolate the wisdom of the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu, who declared, "He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. " And Trump has been prepared.   And yes, sheer gumption matters, too.  It was Trump the man who stared down Megyn Kelly, the Pope, all his Republican rivals, and Hillary Clinton.  And most recently, Trump won the confrontation over the "dirty dossier," the passel of allegations leaked by the "Intelligence Community" last week and published, in all its inglorious   detail, by BuzzFeed.   In his January 11 press conference, held in the middle of the resulting media firestorm, Trump showed no fear as he took on virtually the entire press corps.  He denied all the allegations, adding that reporters should be ashamed of themselves for even thinking of bringing up such an unverified   dump.  He refused to take a question from CNN’s Jim Acosta, labeling the entire network as "fake news," and he lambasted BuzzFeed as a "failing pile of garbage. "   And in fact, soon the MSM was scampering away from the dossier   legend Bob Woodward agreed with Trump, calling it a "garbage document. "  And then, on Twitter, Trump hit back even harder, comparing the attack on him to some sort of atrocity out of Nazi Germany. Needless to say, this turn of events has been disturbing to diehard Trump haters such as Rutenberg.  As he wrote to his brothers and sisters in the Fourth Estate, the next time they were going to do battle with Trump, they had to have a stronger plan.  And speaking of the MSM as a whole, Rutenberg added, "It better figure things out, fast, because it has found itself at the edge of the cliff. "  In the meantime, amidst the MSM disarray, Trump is still on the offensive.  Here’s the headline from the January 15 New York Times: "Trump Team Considers Moving Press Corps, Alarming Reporters. "  That is, the Trump communications shop is considering a plan to move the White House press corps from its current location in the West Wing to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.  In the words of Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary:
