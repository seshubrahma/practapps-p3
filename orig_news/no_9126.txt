  Donald J. Trump will make Congressman Mick Mulvaney the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. [Mulvaney, a Tea Party congressman from South Carolina, helped found the Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives to hold the line on government spending and keep big government Republicans in check.  "Right now we are nearly $20 trillion in debt, but Mick is a very   leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation’s finances and save our country from drowning in red ink," Trump says in a statement. "With Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America’s budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer’s trust in how their money is spent. " Mulvaney was pleased to accept the position. "It is a great honor to be appointed Director of the Office of Management and Budget," he said, The Trump administration will restore budgetary and fiscal sanity back in Washington after eight years of an    tax and spend financial agenda, and will work with Congress to create policies that will be friendly to American workers and businesses. Each day, families across our nation make disciplined choices about how to spend their hard earned money, and the federal government should exercise the same discretion that hardworking Americans do every day.
