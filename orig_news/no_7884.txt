Mitt Romney’s son is still trying to convince the former presidential candidate to throw his hat into the 2016 ring, less than three weeks from the Republican National Convention. [Speaking with John Dickerson at the Aspen Ideas Festival Wednesday, Romney said, "My wife and kids wanted me to run again this time  …     I got an email from one of my sons yesterday, saying ‘You gotta get in, Dad. You gotta get in. ’"  Romney voiced concern, however, that without the full backing of his party, he wouldn’t have much success. Romney went on to tell Dickerson that he did not think he would do well as an independent candidate. "I don’t think an independent candidate can win," he said, adding that the idea of running and asking people to rally behind him with the sole purpose of stopping another candidate  —   in this case, Donald Trump  —   is not something he could do in good faith. Romney has been an outspoken opponent of Donald Trump. In a   televised speech in March, the former governor of Massachusetts criticized the presumptive GOP nominee, yet dispelled speculation of his own 2016 campaign. In 2012, Mitt Romney was defeated by President Barack Obama in his bid for the White House. A potential run now against the 2016 presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would likely have Romney facing a similar fate. A Washington   News poll released in March showed in a hypothetical   race between Romney, Clinton and Trump, Clinton would lead by 2 percent, receiving 37 percent of the vote compared to Trump’s 35 and Romney’s 22.
