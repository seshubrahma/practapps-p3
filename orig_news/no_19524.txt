But it ended the   statement with a cautionary message about the future of   manufacturing jobs in the US.  " ’  ’ ’  ’ "   Carrier became a poster child throughout Trump’s campaign for   problems facing American workers as manufacturing jobs leave the   US. " ’’ ’   "If I was in office, Carrier wouldn’’t be leaving," Trump said in   a speech at the Indiana Fairgrounds in April.

" "   While Carrier’s factories carried major symbolic weight for the     negotiating on a    basis with each   company that threatens to outsource jobs would require a lot of   time and effort  —   especially if each company expects Trump to   sweeten the deal.
