Not just in this hall, but on this Earth. The Founders showed us that. And so have many others since. They were drawn together by love of country, and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow. That is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight. Yes, the world is watching what we do. Yes, America’s destiny is ours to choose. So let’s be stronger together. Looking to the future with courage and confidence. Building a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country. When we do, America will be greater than ever. Thank you and may God bless the United States of America. 11:22: She is vowing to stand up against "mean" rhetoric. 11:21: Clinton says we have to deal divides on immigration and race and says, "so let’s put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable.

We will reform our criminal justice system from    and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. " 11:16: Clinton asks Americans to ImagineTrump "in Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I can’t put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started  —   not by big men with   and restraint, but by little men  —   the ones moved by fear and pride. America’s strength doesn’t come from lashing out. Strength relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power. That’s the kind of    I pledge to be. " She’s now onto gun control. 11:12: Clinton blasting Trump: "He also talks a big game about putting America First.

" She says Democrats are the "party of working people" but "we haven’t shown a good enough job" of understanding their concerns. Clinton pushing for a Constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. She wants American corporations should be "just as patriotic in return  …    " She says it would be " " and "inhumane" to kick out immigrants. She says comprehensive amnesty legislation "is the right thing to do. " "It’s wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other," she says. "And I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again. " [clears throat]10:53: Clinton going over her biography, saying her heart "just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza on this stage, representing millions of young people who  …    because of those changes to our laws  …    are able to get an education.

[clears throat] She says she will be a president for those who vote for her and those who don’t  …     she mentions that we have reached a milestone  …     the first time a major party has nominated a woman for president. She says she’s happy for boys as well because "when any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way for everyone" and "when there are no ceilings, the sky’s the limit.

"   10:47: Clinton: And so it is with humility, determination, and boundless confidence in America’s promise  …     that I accept your nomination for President of the United States! [clears throat.] 10:46: After saying she wrote a book titled "It Takes a Village," Clinton explains what she meant by it: None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone. America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger. I believe that with all my heart. That’s why "Stronger Together" is not just a lesson from our history. It’s not just a slogan for our campaign. " She also says she’s fighting for a county where "love trumps hate. " [She keeps clearing her throat. "   10:45: Interesting transition: "Remember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power. Two hundred and forty years later, we still put our faith in each other. Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers. Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them. And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days. That’s how Americans answer when the call for help goes out. " 10:43: Unity? Audience keeps chanting "Hillary" to drown out Sanders’s protesters. She is mocking Trump for saying, "I, along, can fix it. " [She keeps clearing her throat.] 10:42: Clinton promises to build a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants. She says "we will not ban a religion" and will work with all of our allies to "fight and defeat terrorism. " 10:40: From Breitbart’s Joel Pollak: 10:37: Clinton says when the Founders met, some wanted to stick with the king and some wanted to "stick it to the king. " She says "our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together. " Clinton says our country’s motto is E Pluribus Unum and asks, "will we stay true to our  motto?" She says Trump wants to divide us from the rest of the world and each other. She says Trump has taken Republicans from "morning in America" to "midnight in America. " She says Trump wants us to fear the future and each other. She is now citing FDR’s "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. " 10:32: Crowd chanting "Hillary" to drown out protesters. She says we heard from the man from hope, Bill Clinton, and the man of hope, Barack Obama. Clinton says she wants to thank Bernie Sanders. "Bernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary. " She says Sanders put economic and social justice issues "front and center  …     where they belong. " She wants his supporters to know, "I’ve heard you. Your cause is our cause.

We have to decide whether we’re going to work together so we can all rise together. "We are   about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid. We will rise to the challenge, just as we always have. "So I want to tell you tonight how we’re going to empower all Americans to live better lives. My primary mission as President will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States. From my first day in office to my last. Especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind. From our inner cities to our small towns, Indian Country to Coal Country. From the industrial Midwest to the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley. "The choice we face is just as stark when it comes to our national security. Anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face. From Baghdad and Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, to San Bernardino and Orlando, we’re dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated.

" At Hillary Clinton’s convention this week, Democrats have been speaking about a world that doesn’t exist. A world where America has full employment, where there’s no such thing as radical Islamic terrorism, where the border is totally secured, and where thousands of innocent Americans have not suffered from rising crime in cities like Baltimore and Chicago. In the Democrats’ fantasy world, there is no problem with Hillary Clinton maintaining an illegal, exposed server full of classified information that could have been hacked by any foreign enemy, and in which Hillary Clinton risked prison time to delete 33, 000 emails that were simply about yoga and wedding planning. In this world, there is no Hillary Clinton disaster in Syria, Libya and Egypt, ISIS doesn’t merit a mention, Iran isn’t on the path to nukes, convention stages don’t need American flags, and our great men and women of law enforcement, our police, do not need to be honored. I propose a different vision for America, one where we can break up Washington’s rigged system, and empower all Americans to achieve their dreams. In our vision, we will put America First. If we deliver this change, the future is limitless and we will Make America Great Again for everyone. 4:20: Sanders calls Trump the most "dangerous" candidate to run in modern history. 4:15: SAD!
