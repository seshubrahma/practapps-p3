 (CNN) Hillary Clinton is a    favorite to win the White House over Donald Trump, according to CNN’s Political Prediction Market.  Clinton’s odds for winning the race are at 75% compared to Trump’s at 25% according to the market, an online game administered by the company Pivit, which functions like an online market and allows Internet users to predict the outcome of the 2016 election. It is not to be confused with polls from real voters. Before the Republican National Convention, Trump’s odds for the White House were at 29%. After the convention, he bumped up to 40% odds. Clinton, whose odds were at 71% before the RNC, had her chances trickle down to 61% by July 26    the end of the RNC. But the Democrats’ convention last week provided Clinton with a bounce, according to the market. The ultimate prediction marketplace for the races and issues that matter most, Trump has endured a wave of criticism after he escalated a feud with the Muslim parents of a fallen US solider, who denounced him at the DNC as unfit to be president. He also mistakenly said in an interview on Sunday with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that Russian President Vladimir Putin wouldn’t make a military move into Ukraine, even though Putin seized the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. In a   poll released Monday, Clinton leads Trump by nine points, 52% to 43% in a    matchup. She also leads in a   matchup that includes third party candidates. Clinton leads Trump 45% to 37% with Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson at 9% and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein at 5%.
