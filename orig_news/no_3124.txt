On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s "New Day," former Clinton campaign Press Secretary Brian Fallon stated, "Every day there are new developments, new shoes dropping, so to speak, that call into question the legitimacy of his [  Donald Trump’s] win. "  Fallon said, "Every day there are new developments, new shoes dropping, so to speak, that call into question the legitimacy of his win. First it was with respect to Russian interference. They tried to deny  —   the Trump folks did, that Russia was behind this, now they’ve been forced to admit that. Then they tried to say that it was not for the purposes of trying to help Donald Trump, they were just trying to sow confusion and they were targeting both sides. And now, folks in the government have concluded that it was actually to try to tip the election Donald Trump’s way. And now, with respect to the FBI, we see that Jim Comey’s actions are sufficiently questionable that the internal watchdog at DOJ thinks that they merit an independent review. So, I think Donald Trump is just trying to cling to whatever legitimacy still is in effect here. " (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
