A photo of Sarah and Todd Palin and Dakota Meyer rocking Breitbartâ€™s new Border Wall Construction Co.   was picked up by People magazine on Wednesday. [The humorous photo, originally posted to Palinâ€™s Facebook page and her    Dakota Meyerâ€™s Instagram page, features the former Alaska governor, her husband, Todd, and their daughter Bristolâ€™s Medal of Honor recipient husband prepping for construction on the southern border wall from the familyâ€™s home in Wasilla, Alaska.

"The shirt is being sold by Breitbart and features the tagline, â€˜If you build it, they wonâ€™t comeâ€™ â€”   a riff off the famous line from the 1989 movie Field of Dreams," Petit added. The ranks of the Breitbart Border Wall Construction Co. have swelled considerably since earlier this week, with folks all across the country joining together to take on what will undoubtedly be the most critical construction project of our lifetime.
