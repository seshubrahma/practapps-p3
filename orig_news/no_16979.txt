Sarasota, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump on Monday mocked   music as he once again criticized the performance Jay Z and Beyonce delivered at a rally for Hillary Clinton, asking whether it was "talking or singing." "The language is so bad and as they were singing    singing right? Was it talking or singing? Right? But the language was so bad," Trump said Monday during his first of five rallies the day before Election Day.

It also comes as Clinton has ramped up get out the vote efforts in recent days by targeting young and   voters in particular. Still, Trump insisted that   voters are turning out in droves for him, an assessment contradicted by polls that show Trump with low   support among black voters.

"  are turning out    and when they do a lot of them are voting for Trump," he said. "She’s got not a lot of inspiration. She used the term called ’super predator’ to define black youth. ’Super predator. ’" Trump’s criticism of   follows his repeated and awkward appeals to   that many have criticized as tone deaf and offensive as he has described the lives of African Americans in starkly bleak and   terms. "  are living in hell and are living    in, in the inner cities, I mean, they’re living in hell. You walk to the store for a loaf of bread, you get shot," Trump said during a rally in Sanford, Florida, last month, repeating a line he has frequently used to describe crime rates in black communities. Trump has also described inner cities as worse than war zones and equated the lives of minorities living in inner cities with members of those communities at large, even though a majority of   do not live in poverty.
