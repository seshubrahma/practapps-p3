During an interview with Jake Tapper that was broadcast on CNN on Friday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she is not worried about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s attacks on her because she has "a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation, and the way they behave, and how they speak. "  Partial transcript as follows:  TAPPER: He has lately taken to calling you, I believe, corrupt Hillary.   …     Have you learned anything from watching the way that Republicans dealt with him in the primaries that will inform how you will deal with such an unconventional candidate? CLINTON: Well, you know, remember, I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation, and the way they behave, and how they speak. I’m not going to deal with their temper tantrums, or their bullying, or their efforts to try to provoke me. He can say whatever he wants to say about me, I could really care less. I’m going to stand up for what I think the American people need and want in the next president. That’s why I’ve laid out very specific plans. There’s nothing secret about what I want to do with the economy, with education, with healthcare, with foreign policy. I’ve laid it all out there, and he can’t, or he won’t. I can’t tell which. So, we’re going to talk about what we want to do for the country, and he can continue on his   but that’s the choice he’s making.  Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
