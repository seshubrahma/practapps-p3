Politico is reporting that officials in the eastern European country of Ukraine are seeking ways to apologize to incoming President Donald Trump for their secretive efforts to help Hillary Clinton’s candidacy.

Ukraine’s interference on Clinton’s behalf negatively affected the Trump campaign when accusations against Trump aide Paul Manafort helped cause him to quit the campaign, the online newser said.
