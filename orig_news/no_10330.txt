Sunday on NBC’s "Meet The Press," while discussing The New York Times report on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggesting that he could have legally avoided paying federal income taxes for the last 18 years, former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani said "the reality is, he is a genius. "  Giuliani said, "If he didn’t take advantage of it, he would have been sued. Maybe someone doesn’t want to put out the tax returns because someone will distort it that way. The reality is, he is a genius. what he did was he took advantage of something that could save his enterprise, and he did something we admire in America. He came back. The "Art Of The Deal" is all about that. So did Steve Jobs and Winston Churchill. Churchill was thrown out of politics twice and came back. Great men have big failures, and then they take those failures and return them into results. I’d rather have a genius like Trump other than Hillary Clinton, just getting jobs for the FBI.
