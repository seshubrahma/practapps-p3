Stephen K. Bannon in a rare interview talks with Kimberley A. Strassel of the Wall Street Journal about the winning campaign of Donald J. Trump and his part in helping the   accomplish his vision for America. Bannon also refutes charges of being antisemitic or a white nationalist saying the allegations, "just aren’t serious. It’s a joke. " Below are a few excerpts from the interview: "What mattered in the campaign was winning. We did. " "How can you take anything seriously from a media apparatus —  paid the amount of money you people are paid —  that systematically missed something that was so obvious, that missed Brexit, that missed the Trump revolution? You’d have thought they’d have learned their lesson on November 8. " "I was the one who said we are going to Flint, Michigan, we are going to black churches in Cleveland, because the thrust of this movement is that we are going to bring capitalism to the inner cities. " Why does he think that leftists are so fixated on him? "They were ready to coronateHillary Clinton. That didn’t happen, and I’m one of the reasons why. So, by the way, I wear these attacks as an emblem of pride. " Mr. Bannon believes Mr. Trump to be uniquely suited to make the case, as "one of the best political orators in American history, rated with William Jennings Bryan. " He’s proud that the first job offer —  to former Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn for national security adviser —  went to a "registered Democrat," and that the country is going to see "a lot of interesting choices. " Mr. Trump "knows how to mix and match, get the best out of people, and I think it says something about what a historic figure he could be. "  I never went on TV one time during the campaign. Not once. You know why? Because politics is war. General Sherman would never have gone on TV to tell everyone his plans.  "Breitbart is the most   site in the United States"
