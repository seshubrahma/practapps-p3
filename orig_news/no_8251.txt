Ted Cruz reacted to the recent attacks from his Republican presidential opponent Donald Trump yesterday in an interview with talk radio host Mark Levin. ["I’m not going to respond in kind I am not going to attack Donald personally, I like him, I respect him, and I’m not going into the mud with personal insults and attacks.  Cruz asserted that the only reason political candidates decided to get personal was because they didn’t want to be challenged on the issues. "They don’t want to talk about their own records, and so they try instead just to engage personal attacks," he said. Cruz reminded the audience that Trump argued for expanding Obamacare into socialized medicine and thought the Wall Street TARP bailouts were a "great idea. " He also pointed out that Trump was a supporter of President Obama’s stimulus program as well as an expansion of the ethanol mandate. "That fits the pattern of Donald’s history, which is Donald has for a long time been an advocate of cronyism and corporate welfare," Cruz said, calling it part of Trump’s "New York values. " Cruz again posited that the Washington Establishment was abandoning Marco Rubio and choosing Trump instead. "What we’re seeing is that the Washington Establishment, they’re abandoning Marco Rubio, because they’re determining that Marco can’t win," he said. "And they are rushing full speed to embrace Donald Trump. " He pointed to   comments from Iowa Governor Terry Branstad and former Senator Bob Dole as proof that he "scared the heck out of" members of the establishment. He argued that conservatives were choosing his campaign instead. "We’re seeing conservatives uniting and coalescing behind our campaign and that’s happening more and more each and every day," he said.
