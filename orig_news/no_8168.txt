Hollywood celebrities were beside themselves Thursday night as they watched Donald Trump accept the Republican presidential nomination at the party’s national convention in Cleveland. [Celebrity reaction quickly poured in on Twitter as Trump began his speech Thursday night, with some of the candidate’s most outspoken critics  —   Michael Moore, Rosie O’Donnell, John Legend and George Lopez  —   all weighing in with jabs, jokes and hot takes (and Moore doubled down on his prediction that Trump will win in November).  Other stars following along with Trump’s speech included actresses Elizabeth Banks, Octavia Spencer and Mia Farrow, director and Funny or Die   Adam McKay, horror author Stephen King, Dallas Mavericks owner and Shark Tank shark Mark Cuban and   host Stephen Colbert, most of whom have been hostile to the Republican candidate in the past. Reaction ranged from the simple yet effective (Russell Simmons: #NeverTrump) to the routine (Nazi comparisons from Michael Moore and Josh Gad) to the hysterical (Rosie O’Donnell: "RICH SPOILED PRICK"). With Trump’s speech clocking in at 68 minutes, there was plenty of time for Hollywood’s progressive stars to get their commentary in. Below is a collection of the night’s tweets from Hollywood’s best and brightest. With all due respect to the German people, this WOULD sound better in German.  —   Michael Moore (@MMFlint) July 22, 2016,  Tthe silver lining here is that he can read. And read well!
