Now the Pope has gone and done it. He’s butted into American politics. That has to be the biggest mistake in the history of the Catholic Church. [The Pope actually attacked Donald Trump and said, "Anyone who wants to build a wall is not a Christian. " Really? The Pope is now taking stands against U. S. politicians?  If I was Donald Trump I’d have several responses. The first response would be "THANK YOU. " Americans aren’t like any other people in the world. We are mavericks,   rugged individualists. We march to the beat of a different drummer. We don’t like government telling us what to do, let alone foreign governments or   like The Pope. We don’t take orders from foreign religious leaders. As a matter of fact, we would rather do the opposite of what a foreign leader tells us to do, than take orders from an outsider. Or don’t you remember King George? We fought a revolution and thousands of Americans died over the King’s orders to pay a miniscule tax on tea. We threw a "Boston Tea Party. " We risked our entire country and the lives of our children to fight (and beat)    the most powerful army in the world. That’s how much we bristle when a foreign leader tells us what to do. The Pope obviously doesn’t understand America. But he will soon feel our wrath as millions of conservative Catholics snub his collection plates and our nation elects the exact guy he railed   Donald J. Trump. If I was Donald Trump I’d say publicly and loudly: "THANK YOU FOR THE ENDORSEMENT. I’M CERTAIN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT. " Then I’d go on to hit The Pope with several punches in the gut. Because hypocrites deserve a little embarrassment and   even religious ones. It turns out the Pope isn’t a man of God. He’s a   bleeding heart hypocrite of the highest order. The Pope lectures Donald Trump about building a wall. But guess who has the biggest, baddest, highest wall ever built? The Vatican.  It turns out the Pope is surrounded by a giant wall and an army of border guards. Maybe Popes who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. Donald Trump should channel Ronald Reagan and announce publicly and loudly: "POPE FRANCIS, TEAR DOWN YOUR WALL. "  It’s high time for The Pope to tear down the Vatican’s walls and allow unlimited immigration. Why doesn’t the Pope fill St. Peter’s Square with tents and  ? Where is the compassion and humanity at the Vatican? Then there’s the Pope’s biggest scam. And trust me  …    you can call it something nicer or more pleasant  …    but it’s a scam of the highest order. The Pope has millions of Hispanic CUSTOMERS in   many of them here illegally. Not parishioners  …    customers. They put money in his collection plates. That makes them customers. Here’s the scam part. Those same Hispanics cost The Pope nothing. They pay if they like him  …    if he praises them  …    if he condemns a wall between America and Mexico. But the bill for all their expense goes to the American taxpayer. So the Pope gets the best of both worlds, if he says only nice things about Hispanics and praises illegal immigration. He gets to play "the good guy. " The rest of us who support the laws of the United States are   greedy and  …    "unChristian. " Really? That’s quite a scam you’ve got going there Mr. Pope. The Pope and his church make billions off of Hispanic Catholics whop drop money in the collection plates  …    but they cost the Catholic Church nothing. They take welfare, food stamps, free meals at school, free education, free special courses (English as a second language) free healthcare  …    and earned income tax credits even though they are here illegally. I haven’t even mentioned the costs for police, courts and prison for illegal aliens. It all costs tens of billions. Over time it adds up to hundreds of billions of dollars. While our country is drowning in debt, illegals keep crossing our   border, hiking the bill. Who pays for all of that? Not the Pope. Not the Catholic Church. America’s TAXPAYERS pay the bill. How convenient. So here’s what Donald Trump should announce publicly and loudly: "I’LL COMPROMISE POPE FRANCIS  …    I WON’T BUILD A WALL IF YOU AGREE TO PAY THE BILL FOR MILLIONS OF ILLEGALS, THEREBY REMOVING THE BURDEN FROM U. S. TAXPAYERS. " Pope Francis lectures America about illegal immigration without a thought as to how to pay for it all  …    without a thought as to the pain and misery that the higher taxes necessary to support millions of illegal immigrants cause to his   parishioners  …    or the job losses and lower wages they inflict upon his   parishioners  …    or the added national debt that will destroy the U. S.   just as it has every other big spending socialist nation. While we’re at it, where is this Pope’s pledge to compensate the parents of children murdered by the illegal immigrants he embraces and encourages to come to America? Donald Trump should publicly and loudly announce: "POPE FRANCIS HAS SO MUCH COMPASSION FOR ILLEGALS. BUT WHERE IS THE COMPASSION FOR THE AMERICANS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MURDERED, RAPED, OR KILLED IN DRUNK DRIVING ACCIDENTS BY ILLEGALS? I DEMAND THE POPE SET UP A FUND IMMEDIATELY TO COMPENSATE THE AMERICANS WHOSE LIVES HAVE RUINED BY ILLEGALS. " Perhaps it’s all a big mistake. Perhaps Pope Francis just never noticed the big wall around his own home. Perhaps he just doesn’t understand that America is the most generous nation in world   but only capitalism has allowed our citizens to accumulate enough wealth to donate to this Pope’s Catholic church. Perhaps the Pope has good intentions. But, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Donald Trump’s parting message to Pope Francis: Before you lecture us about compassion and charity and opening our homes to illegal immigrants  …     "TEAR DOWN YOUR WALL  …    . AND START PAYING THE BILL FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THEN WE’LL TALK. " Wayne Allyn Root is known as "the Capitalist Evangelist. " Wayne’s latest book is: "The Power of RELENTLESS.
