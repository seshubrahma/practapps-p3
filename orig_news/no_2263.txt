(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, reiterated his support for Donald Trump, even though Mr. Trump has refused to endorse him. Protesters handed out copies of the U. S. Constitution at Mr. Trump’s town hall meeting in Maine, while military veterans, like those at Capitol Hill, above, have expressed dismay over his comments about the armed services. Mr. Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, faced down an    at a rally in North Carolina who asked why he was "kind of softening up on Mr. Trump’s policies and words. " "I just wanted to make sure he was totally loyal to Mr. Trump and the Republican Party," the boy said later. Watch the video. _____ 2. New polls show Hillary Clinton with a   lead in Florida, a major swing state crucial to Mr. Trump’s chances of winning the presidency, and even further ahead in New Hampshire. Mrs. Clinton, who has been building support among Republicans and billionaires of all stripes, visited an electric company in Las Vegas, above. _____ 3. President Obama met with his National Security Council to discuss progress against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, including the new campaign of airstrikes against the group’s strongholds in Libya. At a news conference afterward, Mr. Obama denied that a $400 million pallet of cash delivered to Iran in January, was ransom for four American citizens Iran released the same day. "Some of you may recall, we announced these payments in January," he said. "Many months ago. It was no secret. " _____ 4. The Malaysian government acknowledged for the first time that the pilot of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which vanished with 239 people aboard more than two years ago, had recorded a route on his personal flight simulator for the southern Indian Ocean. That is the area where a few pieces of debris from the aircraft were found. While not conclusive, the finding deepened suspicion that the pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, deliberately flew off course en route to Beijing. Above, his sister, in February, with her last photo of him. _____ 5. A day before the opening ceremony for the Olympics in Rio, Olympic officials said that 271 Russian athletes would be allowed to compete in the Rio Games  —   118 fewer than the country hoped to enter. Above, some of the Russians arriving in Rio. And a side note: And if you want some appropriate background music, here’s a playlist of essential Brazilian songs. _____ 6. The London police said a knife attack that left an American woman dead and five other people injured on Wednesday night appeared to have been "triggered by mental health issues," not terrorism. The suspect, a    Norwegian of Somali descent, was taken into custody at the scene of the attack, in the upscale neighborhood of Bloomsbury. _____ 7.  The Bank of England is cutting its main interest rate to the lowest point ever, aiming to steady Britain’s newly strained economy. Signs of financial trouble  —   like a plunging pound and sagging consumer confidence  —   have multiplied in the weeks since the country voted to leave the European Union. "There is a clear case for stimulus, and stimulus now, in order to be there when the economy really needs it," the bank’s governor said. _____ 8. "Everybody, let’s help each other, protect each other, save a life before this punk takes another life. " That’s one of the people sharing information and suggesting lines of investigation on the Phoenix Police Department’s social media accounts as the authorities try to find a serial shooter who has killed seven people and injured two since March. The reward for any information leading to an arrest rose this week to $50, 000 from $30, 000. _____ 9. One of our most read stories today tells of the life and death of Julian Washington, 30, who was killed in a stabbing in one of New York City’s deadliest precincts. He had been at a party in a public housing   when a brawl broke out, and someone began slashing away with kitchen knives. Mr. Washington staggered into the building’s hallway, bleeding from the neck, as partygoers fled past him. The Times is documenting every murder recorded this year in the 40th precinct of the South Bronx. Mr. Washington was the sixth. _____ 10. The prototype of an   bus made its debut in China this week. The Transit Elevated Bus, 72 feet long and 26 feet wide, straddles the roadway while cars drive underneath. With the ability to carry 1, 200 passengers, the colossal bus is intended to help ease the country’s traffic congestion, but several questions  —   like what happens to trucks too large to fit below it  —   remain. _____ 11. Finally, this is Harry, the seventh of 21 puppies that have appeared in the Broadway play "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the  . " All found homes with people connected to the theater industry after they aged out of the play. One last puppy is having his moment of fame: Simon, a   golden retriever, will fill the role until the play ends its run on Sept. 4. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
