’  ’ ’   Joe Lonsdale was a little bit nervous as he shook my hand   and flashed his trademark wide grin. His tall,     frame, in a white dress shirt and black dress slacks, towered   over my    self. No jeans. No hoodie. He dressed   respectfully for this rare interview with a journalist. ’ ’   We were on his home turf at his airy San Francisco offices, and   he had     pro Dena Cook at his side. I got   the impression that this moment sums up his personality   perfectly: a ton of confidence thanks to smarts and preparation,   mingled with a touch of nerves, the kind of nerves that make you   want to step up to a challenge, not back down. ’ ’   Lonsdale is like the living embodiment of Silicon Valley all   rolled up into one person: young, smart, geeky, financially   successful, optimistic, passionate, outspoken, and, at times,   controversial, not to mention his involvement in some pretty   scandalous lawsuits. ’ ’   As a rule, he refuses to do interviews with the press. "I don’’t   see the upside in it," he explained. ’ ’   He made an exception for me after we met as speakers at a tech   conference and had an enjoyable lunch together. Even so, it took   months of pestering his people before his tentative "yes" turned   into a date and time. ’ "   It’s not that Lonsdale is shy of talking in public  —   he speaks   often at tech conferences. And he’s been known to write candid   and insightful  the online Q&A forum. For instance, he once   answered the question  about his occasional, noticeably odd   jerky movements, often a facial twitch. " ’   "I agree it is pretty weird  —   I think everyone is just being   polite, but I don’t mind the question," . "It’s   part of a twitch that seems to move around, and comes up a lot,   and we haven’t been able to figure out why but I’ve had some   version of it since I was very young." ’ "   But Lonsdale’s relationship with the press is complicated, and   the stories about him have not always been kind. " ’   The worst of it happened in 2015 when an   sued him,   alleging emotional and sexual abuse. The allegations fit into a   troubling pattern of reports about discrimination and sexism in   Silicon Valley, and the headlines publicly vilified Lonsdale. His   alma mater, Stanford, where he had been a guest lecturer and   where the woman had been a student, kicked him off campus. He    and argued he had evidence that validated his   innocence. ’ "   He was, ironically enough, also helped by the press, such   as  that   depicted his ex as an emotionally fragile woman, him as an   awkward   and their relationship as something that wasn’t   particularly good for either of them. " "   Both suits were eventually dropped and Stanford removed its ban   on him, but the damage to his reputation in 2015 was intense. In   the backdrop of that, his VC firm, . The partners had differing investing   philosophies, and their personality conflicts were exacerbated by   Lonsdale’s public problems, . " ’   Flash forward two years, and Lonsdale, 34, is happy, and he   considers himself "a lucky guy," a term he used repeatedly to   describe his life to me. ’ "   He’s the head of a new venture firm  run by five partners that’s raised over $400   million. He’s newly married to his   girlfriend, and the   couple just welcomed their first child, a baby girl, into the   world. He’s even become known for his   dinners. He has   once again been embraced in Silicon Valley. " ’   This is a story of resilience and the kind of second chances that   Silicon Valley provides to a segment of its members, especially   its young successful entrepreneurs turned power brokers. ’ "   And that’s why he was wary of me on that sunny spring day as I   sat in his leather couch and   office. But as we talked,   the nervousness faded. There was no twitch. Instead,   Lonsdale and I had a candid discussion about: " "   Lonsdale is probably best known as one of the cofounders of   Palantir, a   company that raised $2. 8 billion in venture   funding, is valued at $21 billion, and has a reputation for being   super secretive. He’s no longer with the company, although he’s   still named as an adviser. " ’  ’ "   While he’s not technically a member of the powerful group of   PayPal founders affectionately known as the PayPal mafia, he was   an intern for two summers at the company before it sold and   became a protege of one of them: Palantir’s billionaire cofounder   Peter Thiel. " "   Lonsdale is also known as the cofounder and first CEO of     software startup Addepar (where he’s still the   chairman). " ’   All this before he turned 30. ’ "   He has since invested in dozens of startups as an angel investor   and through the VC companies he founded. He’s on the board of   several   startups, including Hyperloop One, which is   working on the    system envisioned by Elon Musk. " "   When he agreed to this interview, there was one restriction: He   wouldn’t discuss details of either of the two big lawsuits that   involved him, citing confidentiality. One involved Hyperloop One.   The suit was brought by a cofounder and other employees who   alleged company executives misused funds, violated California   labor code, and threatened at least one employee by . The company   denied the allegations, and the . " ’   The other was the suit by his  . But he was willing   to discuss how that whole episode influenced his views of the   world. ’ ’   After his ex made her allegations, his alma mater, Stanford,   barred him from campus. The woman was a student there and he had   been an official "mentor" for a course on entrepreneurialism.   Lonsdale reportedly presented Stanford with emails that he said   helped verify his innocence, but it was only after  on the case   that the Stanford investigator  and the school lifted its ban. ’ ’   Lonsdale is hardly what most people would consider   disenfranchised. But the ordeal made him distrust authorities. He   felt like his voice was being ignored, as if he was railing   against the machine, which he says made him sympathize with what   women have felt like over the years as they fought against   institutional sexism. ’ ’   "The whole experience gave me a lot of empathy for the women who   had to deal with this in the past," he told me. "It was clear   that few of the lawyers or other bureaucrats involved cared about   things like truth or honor  —   they only cared about protecting the   institution." ’ ’   "It also gave me a new appreciation for the anger felt at how the   system failed thousands of women who were just ignored or, worse,   laughed at, in the past decades," he said. "All the recent rules   and pressure from DC did was to sometimes flip who was treated   unfairly. The entire situation can only be changed by strong   leaders who care about honor." ’ ’   On a personal level, the ordeal caused him to become warier of   people. ’ ’   "It’’s made me a lot more careful about who I let into my life and   who I trust," he said. "I was very lucky that I met my now wife   before then." ’ "   But Lonsdale said the fallout from the lawsuit wasn’t the worst   thing that ever happened to him. He went through another period   that was rougher, he said, and in some ways it toughened him up   to survive and thrive after his very bad, awful 2015. " ’   His most difficult year was 2008, he said. His mom had passed   away and he was having failures with projects at Palantir, which   had been founded four years earlier. He had also overextended   himself. ’ ’   "I was having a tough time, and I was doing all these things. And   there was some politics. Some people were threatened by me around   Peter, so the whole thing was a really tough year," he said. "I   did make a lot of mistakes. I probably shouted at people that   didn’t need to be shouted at." ’ ’   When that year was over, he opted to start something new:   Addepar. "It was clear it was time to replace myself and clear it   was the right time to do it," he said. "Peter was very supportive   and backed me on that. I had already vested all my shares and   became an adviser to Palantir." ’ "   Palantir CEO Alex Karp was also OK with his move. If he hadn’t   been, Lonsdale would have stayed until he could have left on good   terms. " ’   "I do get bothered a little bit by the culture in Silicon Valley,   where there’s not as much loyalty and dedication to these   things," he said. "I think in general it’’s really important to   follow through on your responsibilities and transition at the   right time. " ’ ’   Lonsdale was in some ways born and raised to confront conflict   and win. ’ ’   He grew up in Silicon Valley in the   East Bay town of   Fremont, where his parents stretched to afford their house and   send their three boys to great schools. ’ ’  ’ ’   "I was really lucky about two things about my life as a kid. I   had awesome parents and I had awesome peers," Lonsdale said. ’ ’   But his family of three boys also had something else: an   unrelenting drive to win. ’ ’   "Our family is very, very competitive. But it’’s a fun and   inspiring sort of competitive. It makes you proud of what you do,   and makes you want to work hard, and do all your homework, so you   can win," he said. ’ ’   For instance, he credits his dad for training him to break a        record in the breaststroke in grade school. ’ ’   "I was the only one doing   and   because what      kid does that?" he joked. ’ ’   With his inner drive and his parents’’ coaching, Lonsdale and his   brainy friends won chess championships on a team coached by his   dad. He graduated valedictorian, had "mostly perfect test   scores," and landed a coveted spot to attend Stanford University. ’ "   At Stanford, he joined the university’s small group of     students and its Libertarian paper, the Stanford Review. " ’   "It’s not as much about the politics as it was about being   contrarian. Hopefully, I’m slightly more mature now, but I’ve   always relished standing out from the crowd, standing up and   disagreeing with everyone," he said. "If I had grown up in   Arkansas, I would have joined up with the   club." ’ ’   A lot of this parallels the background of his billionaire mentor,   Peter Thiel, who also grew up in Silicon Valley, was a chess   genius, went to Stanford, and is a notorious contrarian and   Libertarian. Thiel was a founder of the Stanford Review. ’ "   Although Lonsdale didn’t know Thiel well when he worked as an   intern at PayPal, that job helped him get an internship at   Thiel’s next company, a hedge fund, where he soon captured   Thiel’s attention. " ’   "I actually hired people around me and I helped launch projects   and I didn’t realize at the time that that’s not what interns   did. I thought you just started building stuff, if you were   there. To Peter’s credit, he put up with it and didn’t say, ’’Who   does this kid think he is? ’’" Lonsdale laughed. ’ ’  ’ ’   These days, many people in Silicon Valley are upset at Thiel for   his politics and his perceived  . For instance,   Thiel helped elect Donald Trump, a deeply unpopular president in   much of Silicon Valley, and remains his adviser. Thiel also   secretly funded a lawsuit that bankrupted the Gawker news site. ’ "   Lonsdale isn’t on board with all of Thiel’s choices. " ’   "I don’t agree with him on a lot, but he’s also a genius and   someone who’’s a very good person to learn from about business,"   he said. ’ ’   For example, being contrarian is "good for investing and   entrepreneurship" because it helps people to "think differently,"   he said. ’ ’   As for politics, Lonsdale still leans right but said, "I care a   lot more about making sure we create opportunities and help the   bottom of our society as one of our key duties, one of our   highest duties." ’ ’   His political activism comes in the form of founding startups,   like  which offers   financial software to help governments manage taxes and share   best practices. ’ "   Lonsdale credits Palantir’s CEO Karp for helping him become more   politically mellow. Karp studied philosophy under the University   of Frankfurt’s Jürgen Habermas. " ’   "One of my biggest intellectual influences in my life was Alex   Karp of Palantir," Lonsdale said, calling him " a very thoughtful   person." From Karp, he saw "there’’s truth on both extremes, and   if you are missing one side, you become a very lopsided person." ’ "   For all his antiauthority proclivities, Lonsdale’s biggest   success in tech is a company that was created for the purpose of   helping governments conduct intelligence and spy work by sifting   through oceans of data. " ’  ’ "   Palantir’s roster of clients  —   which include the CIA and various   other international agencies  —   and the company’s reputation for   secrecy have given it a veneer of mystery that sets it apart from   the typical   Silicon Valley startup. " ’   This has led to  about the company and the work it does. ’ "   But Lonsdale said Palantir’s reputation for secrecy is simply an   inherited quirk and not an indication of some sort of evildoing. " ’   At first, the company was quiet because its roster of brilliant   but geeky people were more focused on building the product and   persuading rather secretive government agencies like the CIA,   FBI, and M16 to use it, rather than broadly marketing it, he   said. ’ ’   And then the secrecy became ingrained as a cultural thing. ’ ’   "At all these companies, when companies get so successful, they   tend to enshrine their quirks," Lonsdale said. He cited Apple and   its reputation for secrecy as an example. ’ ’   But cultural secrecy no longer serves Palantir, Lonsdale   believes. "I disagree with their PR strategy. I think they have a   responsibility and should engage more," he said. ’ ’  ’ ’   After leaving Palantir altogether and vacating the CEO role at   Addepar to become its chairman, Lonsdale has now moved on from   his focus in his 20s as an entrepreneurial exec. ’ ’   "There are people who are better managers than I am. I aspire to   be a really good manager, but it’’s not my natural personality to   do the same thing for 14 hours a day. I have a lot of different   interests. I really like product and strategy and business   strategy, and I think I’m not bad at it," he said. ’ "   That means he’s involved in a dizzying number of companies,   between his angel investments, 8VC, and his earlier VC   investments, plus the boards of nonprofits, like Strive for   College, which helps students apply to colleges. Although he says   he sleeps six to seven hours a night, he says he’s a borderline   workaholic trying to balance his new life as husband and dad. " ’   "I have a lot of responsibility. There’s like this fantasy where   you could sneak away to the beach instead," he said. "Right now   that’s on my mind. How do I make space?" ’ "   Still, he learned a big lesson about the value of his work when   one of these companies literally saved his   ’s life   and possibly his wife’s. " ’   Last year, a few months before his wedding day, his fiancée,   Tayler Cox, discovered she had a gene that indicated a high risk   of cancer. She found out because Lonsdale had a genetic test   laying around the house from  backed   by his previous fund. ’ ’   "I had an extra test from this company I cared about. So my wife   just did it on a whim, and she found out that she has this risk,"   he said. After that, she had her mom take the test. It came out   positive for an   gene. The mom and her doctor   decided to remove her ovaries preventatively. ’ ’  ’ ’   "And they go in and take them out and they find stage 3 cancer,"   he said. "Which is terrifying. Fortunately, we were able to get   her surgery, get her chemo, and she seems to be in full remission   right now. If we hadn’t done that, we’d be losing her this year." ’ "   While Lonsdale had already been investing in health startups,   he’s now even more gung ho about the market. " "   And again, he said he can’t help feel extremely fortunate. " ’   "I’’m a lucky guy to be in my position. I’m very lucky I really   enjoy what I’’m doing," he flashed that wide smile. "I’’m a lucky   guy." ’ ’Joe Lonsdale was a little bit nervous as. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
