CNN posted a questionable headline on Sunday linking African American voters to felons, reading: "Trump wants GOP to court black voters  —   then slams voting rights for felons. "[  The move comes after CNN, which Donald Trump calls the "Clinton News Network," continuously covered Breitbart News headlines last week, calling them "offensive. " The article published on Sunday by CNN’s Ashley Killough and Karl de Vries is about the Republican nominee’s recent outreach to African American voters during his campaign rally in Virginia on Saturday and his criticism of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s plan to restore the voting rights of felons. McAuliffe, who is under FBI investigation for campaign contributions, could potentially become a felon himself. CNN describes the plan as "a move McAuliffe says could help   who were disproportionally affected by laws that put lifetime bans on felons. " But CNN’s article doesn’t provide statistics or the percentage of felons who are African American that would be eligible to vote in order to substantiate McAuliffe’s claim, thereby equating Trump’s appeal to African American voters as an appeal to felons. Virginia’s Supreme Court struck down McAuliffe’s order in July, as CNN reported at the time.
