President Donald Trump honored prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action, flying the   flag above the White House on Wednesday. [The black flag with the silhouette of a soldier by a guard tower and barbed wire honors those soldiers that have not returned from war. The flag was adopted by the National League of Families in 1970.  A White House source cited the 1998 Defense Authorization Act as the reason for the flag placed above the presidentâ€™s home on Wednesday, as Congress designated Flag Day as a day for the   flag to be displayed. All war memorials, major military installations, the Pentagon, and the Capitol are expected to fly the flag on Flag day.
