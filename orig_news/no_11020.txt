Former NBC reporter Michael Isikoff is urging the network to broadcast the 1999   interview with Juanita Broaddrick where she said she was raped by Bill Clinton. [Isikoff also said NBC has tried to hide Broaddrick’s interview to exclude her statement that Hillary Clinton tried to intimidate her.  In an online discussion on SideWire. com, Isikoff said that "NBC has the full tape of the original Lisa Myers interview," with Broaddrick, and therefore "NBC ought to check its archive and run the full interview. " Isikoff said: Folks have made much of the fact that her claim about the conversation she had with Hillary wasn’t in the interview that [was] run. Broaddrick said it got cut out Lisa Myers has since agreed Broaddrick said this   and NBC chose to cut it out. .So NBC ought to check its archive   …     and run the full interview. Isikoff, an investigative journalist, was formerly the the National Investigative Correspondent for NBC News. He discovered Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky in 1998, but his story was shelved by network executives. Isikoff said he was amazed at many senior Democrats who earlier jumped to defend Bill Clinton, are touting Trump’s remarks about women. "It’s amazing to watch how D’s who attacked those women are now embracing the Trump accusers, while the Rs who believed them [also] attack [Trump’s accusers]," he said. Isikoff’s call adds pressure on the Clinton campaign to respond to Broaddrick’s claims, after she told Breitbart in an exclusive interview yesterday that Hillary Clinton tried to silence and intimidate her to prevent her from pursuing her legal claims against her husband.
