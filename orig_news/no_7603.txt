Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is reportedly looking into a presidential run as an Independent. A new Morning Consult Poll suggests Bloomberg entering the presidential race would hurt Hillary Clinton more than GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. [According to the results, in a   between Bloomberg, Clinton and Trump, "Clinton’s support declines by 8 points, to 36 percent, and Trump’s support declines by 5 points, to 37 percent. "  Bloomberg would pull support from independents and adults under 30 years old from Clinton if he entered the race, according to the new poll that also found Bloomberg receives 13 percent in a   matchup. "When pitted in a   race with former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, Republican presidential   Donald Trump gets 37 percent of voters, Democrat leader Hillary Clinton gets 36 percent and Bloomberg, an independent, gets 13 percent," notes Morning Consult Polling. More than 4, 000 registered voters participated in the online poll. The margin of error is plus or minus two percent.
