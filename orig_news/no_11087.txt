Evan Osnos writes that Donald Trump "may seek to shape the outcome" of the Republican National Convention by priming his supporters to riot. [From the New Yorker:  More than three months before any ballots have been cast at the Republican convention, Roger Stone, Donald Trump’s     consigliere, has delivered the campaign equivalent of a severed horse head to delegates who might consider denying Trump the nomination.
