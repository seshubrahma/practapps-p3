After violent riots in Charlotte, North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is addressing crime and violence. ["This is a national crisis," Trump said during a speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Thursday. He said it is the job of the president to address the crisis and save African American lives.  Trump touted former New York City Mayor Rudy Giulianiâ€™s policies that he says brought down the crime rate by 76 percent and murder rate in New York City by more than 80 percent. "We need a national   agenda to make our cities safe again," Trump stressed. "Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success. " He also praised law enforcement, saying they need support. "They are the line separating civilians and civilization from total chaos. "
