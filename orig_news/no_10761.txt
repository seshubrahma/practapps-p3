Madonnaâ€™s charity fundraiser turned political in Miami, Florida, Friday night after she ripped   Donald Trump from the stage. [Images of Trump flashed on the screen as Madonna sang, "You know that youâ€™re toxic," in a   version of Brittney Spearsâ€™ 2003 hit song "Toxic. "    The    singer hosted the glitzy gala to raise money for the African nation of Malawi, the birthplace of her adopted    son, David. During her politically charged   performance, the Material Girl reportedly railed against the U. S. and the destruction of Native American land. "It just really makes me feel ashamed, ashamed to be an American, ashamed to be a human being really," Madonna said according to the Associated Press. The stars who showed up Friday night include Leonardo DiCaprio, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, and James Corden. Madonnaâ€™s fundraiser was part of the Art Basel Miami Beach, a   art fair that showcases contemporary paintings, photographs, and films from around the world. At one point during the auction, Madonna and her   Sean Penn took the stage. The singer offered to remarry the actor if he agreed to donate to a charitable cause:  "ðŸ’™"Does this remind you of anything?  â€¦    . .And Iâ€™m still in love with you  â€¦    "  â€”   #Madonna last night @ArtBasel Miami with Sean Penn (  ) ðŸ’™ #madonna #seanpenn  #artbaselmiami #FaenaForum #madonnafans #madonnafamily #marriage #auction  #americanicon #tearsofaclown  #Repost from @madonnabible, A video posted by Madonna Universe (@madonnauniverse) on Dec 3, 2016 at 5:45am PST,  Madonna reportedly joked about a promise she made to perform oral sex on anyone who had voted for her preferred presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. Indeed, Madonna spent much of the campaign criticizing Trump. Just days before voters went to the polls to cast their votes, Madonna implored her 8. 3 million Instagram followers to "Vote Clinton or we are all FUCKED. " By the end of Friday nightâ€™s event, Madonna had raised more than $7. 5 million for the African nation of Malawi. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.
