Wednesday’s attempted baseball massacre by alleged shooter James Hodgkinson appears to be just the latest in a series of violent outbursts from the Left.

While the young man’s political affiliation remains unknown, his attackers shouted, "F*ck Trump" and "F*ck white people. " The whole episode was so horrendous that it drew significant mainstream media attention and condemnation from   Obama. 6. Antifa Rioters Lay Waste to DC in Response to Trump Inauguration,  Above: Antifa terrorism in Washington following Trump’s inauguration ( @nicknbcboston) Antifa’s representatives and members of   organizations such as BAMN, proudly engage in violence with the justification that any speech they do not like is, in fact,   against future violence. Their rage was on full display in Washington, DC in the days surrounding Trump’s inauguration. Rioters smashed the windows of cars and businesses. One Trump supporter was assaulted as he attempted to put out   fires. As Breitbart News reported:   protesters wearing black masks clashed with police officers in front of the National Press Club Thursday night, January 19, 2017.

Many of the   protesters physically resisted police efforts to clear the sidewalk as others shot their middle fingers to the police officers. 7.

Many were quick to point out that the iconic flashpoint of free speech protests had now become a symbol of suppression of free speech. 8.

She responded: I guess it makes sense the people throwing chemicals or bodily fluids at chicks faces would be protesting the #MarchAgainstsharia,  —   Lauren Southern (@Lauren_Southern) June 10, 2017,  This list is by no means exhaustive. Indeed, it does not even scratch the surface of calls for violence in rhetorical discourse. To give perspective, over 12, 000 tweets have called for Trump’s assassination since his inauguration. This list merely highlights significant incidents of Leftist violence to illustrate heightening divisions in a country increasingly fractured on political fault lines. These divisions have grown to the point where it is not improbable that Wednesday’s alleged shooter could have been influenced by partisan rhetoric to shoot up a Congressional baseball game after rationalizing that "It’s time to destroy Trump  Co. " (His attempts were met with praise on the   corners of Twitter.) These events and others have led commentators on both the right and the left to postulate whether America is perhaps in the beginning stages of Civil War.
