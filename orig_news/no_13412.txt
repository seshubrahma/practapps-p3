Tuesday night at a gathering for "Black Lives Matter" at the vice president’s Naval Observatory home, Joe Biden jokingly "thanked" Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for "making the American people look in the mirror" on race.  Biden said, "I want to thank Donald Trump. That is a joke That is a joke because the press is here. But guess what? The stuff he’s doing, and others, including Cruz and others. He’s making the American people look in the mirror. And the American people are honest. And they look in the mirror and see what’s looking back at them. They know there is no easy answer to this.
