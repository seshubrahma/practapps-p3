Saturday at a rally in Fredericksburg, VA, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump attacked his general election opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s proposal on immigration reform.  According to Trump, Clinton’s effort would put illegal immigrants in a better position than veterans. "Hillary Clinton’s amnesty plan will give jobs, benefits and Social Security to millions of people here illegally at taxpayer expense and many of these people are treated better than our vets are treated. That is not going to happen. " Trump went on to point to Clinton’s proposed handling of refugees, which he reiterated his line from a day earlier that Clinton would rather provide jobs for refugees than unemployed   youth. "On top of that, according to the U. S. Senate immigration subcommittee, her plan would bring 620, 000 refugees in her first term alone from Syria  —   not going to know who they are and where they came from," he continued. "Could be the great Trojan horse of all time. Get ready. Get ready. She would rather provide a job to a refugee living overseas than a young unemployed   youth in Virginia. A Trump administration will put American workers first. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. We will bring America together as one country again, united as Americans in common purpose and common dreams. We will have a thriving economy, a strong border, a powerful military, a peaceful nation, a rising standard of living. This is what I promise you. Let’s get out there and vote on November 8.
