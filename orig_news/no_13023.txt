CLEVELAND, Ohio  —   Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) one of Donald Trump’s senior advisors, officially nominated the presumptive GOP nominee for President of the United States on Tuesday evening at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. ["Americans love our country like no other people on earth, but we have gotten off course and the American people know it," Sessions stated. He went on to say:  Our political system is not working. We operate like the trench warfare battles of World War I, where hundreds of thousands die, but no ground is gained. Good Americans will stand for this no longer. They want the political games, the posturing and the show votes to end. "One man  —   Donald Trump was not intimidated. He would not be silenced," Sessions praised. "He spoke the truth. He gave voice to the people’s concerns. "
