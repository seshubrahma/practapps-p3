Welcome to Breitbart News’s live coverage of the 2017 inauguration of Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States. [All times Eastern.  8:08 AM: From last night  —   Watch   anarchists destroy a U. S. Flag and light fires in D. C.: WARNING: Explicit language,  12:53 AM: Watch video below of Trump’s remarks at the donor reception earlier this evening: 11:10 PM: Tens of thousands of   protestors and celebrities kicked off   filmmaker Michael Moore’s "100 Days of Resistance" Thursday, rallying outside Donald Trump’s New York City International Hotel. Breitbart’s Jerome Hudson reported on the event "which featured speeches from political figures including New York Mayor Bill De Blasio and Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges and actors Alec Baldwin, Robert De Niro, and Mark Ruffalo. " Moore told the crowd that America has entered into a "very dangerous" time, after electing a "sociopath. " "With a lot of work on our part, we will stop this man," Moore shouted. "He will not last four years. " "If your rep is a Democrat, tell   you expect them to AGGRESSIVELY fight the Trump agenda  —   and if they don’t, you will work with others to support a true progressive in the Democratic primary in 2018," Moore added.  10:40 PM:   protestors continue to gather outside the National Press Club in Washington, D. C. Thursday. Here is a list by Breitbart’s Lee Stranahan of the 75 leftist groups trying to stop Trump from taking office. "Our streets, our streets, our streets!"

McCabe (@NeilWMcCabe) January 20, 2017,  10:09 PM: AP reports: 10 Promises Trump Made for His First Day, WASHINGTON (AP)  —   Behind in the polls in late October, Donald Trump ventured to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to give American voters a "contract" detailing what he would achieve during his first day in office. Beneath a list of 18 major actions was the flourish of Trump’s familiar signature and a blank space for voters to sign. But as Trump becomes president on Friday, it remains hazy as to which actions he will immediately take. The list included several items likely to fire up Republican voters but backed up by scant policy. It includes "begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants" and "cancel every unconstitutional executive action   …     by President Obama. " Trump has already backed down from one pledge to label China a currency manipulator, recently saying he would first like to speak with the Chinese leadership. A look at 10 of the key promises Trump made for his first day as president:  —  Introduce a constitutional amendment for congressional term limits.  —  Freeze hiring for the federal government to reduce payrolls, although the military, public safety and public health agencies would be exempt.  —  Ban White House and congressional officials from becoming lobbyists for five years after they leave the government.  —  Announce plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico or withdraw from the deal.  —  Formally withdraw from the   Partnership.  —  Lift restrictions on mining coal and drilling for oil and natural gas.  —  Remove any   roadblocks to energy projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline.  —  Cancel U. S. payments to U. N. climate change programs and redirect the money to U. S. water and environmental infrastructure.  —  Stop all federal funding to "sanctuary cities," places where local officials don’t arrest or detain immigrants living in the country illegally for federal authorities.  —  Suspend immigration from regions associated with terrorism where vetting is difficult. 9:58 PM: Breitbart News’ Ian Hanchett reports: During a live report on Thursday’s "Tucker Carlson Tonight" on the Fox News Channel, a young man protesting in Washington, DC claimed to have started a fire in the street, "Because I felt like it. And because I’m just saying, ‘Screw our president. ’" "Screw our President!"  —   Child claims to have started fire at @realDonaldTrump protest. pic. twitter.   —   Fox News (@FoxNews) January 20, 2017,  9:38 PM: Breitbart’s Washington, D.

C. on the eve of his inauguration. He told a cheering crowd that in 2018 Republicans are going to win more seats in the Senate. Breitbart’s Neil Munro reports: "We have an election coming up in two years," Trump told the crowd after thanking his early and his late donors. "We’re going to get a lot of them elected  …     [GOP Sen.] Mitch McConnell is here, he’s smiling so big," Trump joked. McConnell is the GOP leader of the Senate. In 2018, he will have the opportunity to push his narrow 52 to 48 majority up to dominant 58 or even 60 seats. If the GOP reaches 60 Senate seats, then McConnell will usually be able to break the Democrats’s "filibuster" ability to block legislation. Forty Senators are needed to maintain a filibuster.   Senate Democrats face   in November 2018, while only eight Republicans must face the voters. Among the Democrats, nine Senators are either freshmen or won less than 53 percent in their prior election, and four will face the voters in states won by Trump. Several balls and dinners are taking place around town tonight amid protests.

I’d like to congratulate our incredible entertainers tonight. Toby, and Lee Greenwood and all of the great talent. It was really very special. I also have to thank our incredible military right here. Thank you. Stand up, please. You guys were really great. Thank you. So this journey began 18 months ago. I had something to do with it, but you had much more to do with it than I did. I’m the messenger. I’m just the messenger. And we were tired. And I love you. Believe me, I love you. We all got tired of seeing what was happening. And we wanted change, but we wanted real change. And I look so forward to tomorrow. We’re going to see something that is going to be so amazing. So many people have poured into Washington, D. C. This started out tonight being a small little concert, and then we had the idea maybe we’ll do it in front of the Lincoln Memorial. I don’t know if it’s ever been done before. But if it has, very seldom. And the people came by the thousands and thousands, and here we are tonight, all the way back. All the way back. So it’s a movement that began, it’s a movement that started, and it’s a movement like we’ve never seen anywhere in the world, they say. There’s never been a movement like this and it’s something very, very special. And we’re going to unify our country, and our phrase  —   you all know it, half of you are wearing the hat  —   "Make America Great Again. " But we’re going to make America great for all of our people, everybody. Everybody throughout our country. That includes the inner cities, that includes everybody.  And we’re going to do a special job, and I can only tell you that 18 months ago, we never knew, a lot of people didn’t know, some people had a feeling. A lot of people didn’t give us much of a chance, but we understood what was happening. And that last month of the campaign, when I traveled around to every place that you can imagine. State after state after state, speech after speech. And we had ten thousand, twenty thousand, thirty thousand people. There was never an empty seat, just like tonight. We didn’t know if anybody would even come tonight. This hasn’t been done before. And you look. It was the same way. And we all knew that last month of the campaign. I think a lot of us knew the first week of the campaign, but that last month of the campaign we knew that something special was happening.  And I can only tell you this: The polls started going up, up, up, but they didn’t want to give us credit. Because they forgot about a lot of us. On the campaign I called it "the forgotten man" and "the forgotten woman. " Well, you’re not forgotten anymore. That I can tell you. Not forgotten anymore. So I want to thank my great family, my incredible wife Melania. They’ve been so supportive, and it wasn’t easy for them. But they have been so supportive. I want to thank you, most importantly. And I promise you that I will work so hard. We’re going to get it turned around. We’re going to get our jobs back. We’re not going to let other countries take our jobs any longer. We’re going to build up our great military. We’re going to build it up. We’re going to strengthen our borders. We’re going to do things that haven’t been done for our country for many, many decades. It’s going to change. I promise you it’s going to change. So I’ll see you tomorrow. And I don’t care frankly if it’s going to be beautiful or if it’s going to rain like crazy. Makes no difference to me. I have a feeling it’s going to be beautiful. But I will see you tomorrow, and I’m going to be cheering you on. You’re going to cheer me on, but I’m going to be cheering you on. Because what we’ve done is so special. All over the world they’re talking about it. All over the world. And I love you folks, and we’re going to work together. And we are going to  —   make America great again. And I’ll add: Greater than ever before! Thank you very much and enjoy the fireworks. Thank you everybody. Thank you for joining us at the Lincoln Memorial   a very special evening! Together, we are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! pic. twitter.   —   Donald J.
