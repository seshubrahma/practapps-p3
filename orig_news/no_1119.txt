(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. We all knew it was coming, but now it’s official: The "Brexit" has begun. Prime Minister Theresa May invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, putting Britain on track to leave the European Union in 2019 and upending the order established after World War II. Here’s what comes next in the country’s march into the unknown. The bloc loses its   economy, and hard questions abound about whether the pivot toward nationalism and   marks the start of a more volatile global era. _____ 2. The United States and China appear likely to switch roles on environmental issues, thanks to President Trump’s executive order aimed at undoing the Obama administration’s climate change policies. China, despite its own dire air pollution, seems ready to push the U. S. to adhere to the 2015 Paris Agreement, which Mr. Trump has signaled he has no intention of doing. Today on The Daily podcast, we discuss Mr. Trump’s efforts to roll back environmental rules. _____ 3. Leaders of the Senate investigation into Mr. Trump’s possible ties to Russia sought to distance themselves from the flagging House inquiry  —   and present a unified political front. The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee pledged to interview key players and press intelligence agencies to provide information. "This investigation’s scope will go wherever the intelligence leads," said Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, above with Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. _____ 4. Ivanka Trump is becoming an official, though unpaid, federal employee. The move, which she says subjects her to federal rules, is meant to answer concerns over the ethics implications of her earlier unofficial role in her father’s administration. The implications for her business are not immediately clear. Ms. Trump’s title will be special assistant to the president. Her husband, Jared Kushner, has the title of senior adviser. _____ 5. "An outrageous abuse of power. "  That was the judge who sentenced two figures in the "Bridgegate" case, when lanes to the George Washington Bridge were closed to jam traffic in a New Jersey town whose mayor had refused to endorse Gov. Chris Christie for  . Bridget Anne Kelly, a former Christie aide, above, is to serve 18 months, and Bill Baroni, a former Christie ally at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is to serve two years. _____ 6. The Fox News host Bill O’Reilly apologized to Representative Maxine Waters of California. He had called her hair "a James Brown wig. " But right after the mea culpa, he went on the attack, accusing her of demagogy for criticizing Mr. Trump. Ms. Waters declined to spar. "I’m not going to be put down, I’m not going to go anywhere," she said on MSNBC. "I’m going to stay on the issues. " _____ 7. We compiled tips on how to protect your privacy online, like using a VPN. They may come in handy, given Congress’s decision to dismantle   rules that, had they been allowed to go into effect this year, would have required internet providers to get permission before collecting and selling customers’ online information, including browsing activities. But our tech writer points out that you didn’t have much online privacy to begin with. _____ 8. "It was never my intention to go against the president of the United States," said Mohamed Iye, a   American citizen whose wife and daughters were stranded abroad when the Trump administration’s travel ban took effect. "I was just following the law and doing everything the way it’s in the books. And it came to this. " Like more than 50 others, he has filed a lawsuit against Mr. Trump over the ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries. (The second version of the ban is currently held up by rulings from federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland.) _____ 9. The supplies in many school nurses’ offices include EpiPens for allergic reactions, inhalers for asthma  —   and now naloxone, an antidote for opioid overdoses. As communities across the country face a deadly toll from heroin and pills, educators are increasingly worried. "Some people worry that this says, ‘Oh, there are drugs in the schools,’" said one school official. "No, there are drugs everywhere. " _____ 10. Bob Dylan will accept his Nobel Prize for literature in Stockholm after all. On his terms. Mr. Dylan greeted news of the prize last fall with silence and skipped the December ceremony, citing   commitments. He’s to receive the award this weekend in Stockholm, where he’s playing two concerts. Members of the Academy "will show up at one" and then hand over his medal privately, an academy spokesman wrote. "All according to Dylan’s wishes. " _____ 11. Finally, the cast of "The Daily Show" proposed a new strategy to save Meals on Wheels: deliver sandwiches via rocket launcher. And The Times’s chief TV critic investigated the existential doubt caused by surreal shows, like FX’s "Legion," before its season finale airs tonight.
