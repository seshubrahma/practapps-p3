Tuesday at a press conference at Trump Tower in New York City, while explaining his contributions to veterans’ charities, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump got into several heated exchanges with the press even calling one of the reporters a "sleaze. "  Trump said, "What I don’t want is when I raise millions of dollars, have people say —   like this sleazy guy right over here from ABC, he’s a sleaze in my book. " ABC’s Tom Llamas asked, "Why am I a sleaze?" Trump answered, "You’re a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
