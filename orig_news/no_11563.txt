CLEVELAND, Ohio —   The line to get into the premiere of Dinesh D’Souza’s new documentary, Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party, wrapped around the block at a theater in Cleveland Sunday afternoon. A loud cheer erupted from the crowd when D’Souza and his wife entered the theater. [Breitbart News spoke with D’Souza inside the theater as hundreds of enthusiastic fans circled the documentary filmmaker to congratulate him and snap a quick photograph.  "I’m very excited about it. We had an LA premiere, about a week ago. This is the second premiere here in Cleveland, you can see the level of excitement. The movie just opened in three theaters: one in Dallas, one in Phoenix, and one in Hueston. So Green basis we are the number one movie in America we have just been packing the theaters and people go wild. I’m really excited because at the end of the movie everybody applauds and cheers and that is rare in a theater so we are very happy to see that. We expect great things from the movie". Stacia Huyler, a candidate for State Representative in Rhode Island, and Trump alternate delegate is very concerned about the potential of another Clinton administration. She hopes this movie will help to reverse the trajectory we are on. "It will expose Hillary and the depth of the Clinton corruption. I hope anyone who is considering voting for Hillary Clinton will see this documentary. Having another Clinton leading the country will be the ultimate downfall of America!"
