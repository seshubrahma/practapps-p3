"The shameful list stretches from Marine le Pen and the Front National in France, Geert Wilders in Holland, Norbert Hofer in Austria,   leaders in Poland and Hungary to most of the Republican Party and the Ku Klux Klan. "In Britain, Nigel Farage and UKIP are at the head of the Trump bandwagon supported by sections of the Tory Party. Racism  —   whether Islamophobia, or   relentless scapegoating of migrants and refugees, the disregard for black lives or shockingly, blatant belief in white supremacy  —   is growing significantly. Racial attacks and other hate crimes are worryingly on the rise. "
