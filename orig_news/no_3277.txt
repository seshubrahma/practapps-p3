I don’t know if what she knows is privileged, but we need to hear from Michelle, too. #PutObamaUnderOath,  —   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) April 4, 2017,  Rice allegedly ordered surveillance of Donald Trump’s campaign aides during the 2016 presidential election, and maintained spreadsheets of their telephone calls, the Daily Caller reported. The alleged spreadsheets add a new dimension to reports on Sunday and Monday by blogger Mike Cernovich and Eli Lake of Bloomberg News that Rice had asked for Trump aides’ names to be "unmasked" in intelligence reports. The alleged "unmasking" may have been legal, but may also have been part of an alleged political intelligence operation to disseminate reports on the Trump campaign widely throughout government with the aim of leaking them to the press. The surveillance and spreadsheet operation were allegedly "ordered one year before the 2016 presidential election. " According to a Fox News report on Monday, former White House aide Ben Rhodes was also involved.
