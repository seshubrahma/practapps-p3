Friday on Fox News’s "O’Reilly Factor," Glenn Beck spread the false information that Donald Trump voted for Barack Obama in 2008. To back his erroneous claim, Beck cited a fake photoshopped tweet from faketrumptweet. com. Responding to an inquiry from Breitbart News Monday, we were informed by a Fox News source that the record will be corrected on Monday night’s "O’Reilly Factor. "  Beck will not be a guest, we were told, but a segment will cover Beck’s error and by extension inform "O’Reilly Factor" viewers of the truth. After Trump slammed Beck for falling for the fake tweet, Beck doubled down Saturday with a tweet taunting Trump, "Why do you keep saying things like you didn’t vote for @BarackObama ?  …     just admit it @realDonaldTrump. Later Saturday night, after apparently figuring out he’d been duped, Beck finally took to his Facebook account to apologize for spreading the misinformation. On Monday, Beck returned to Facebook to argue that while he did fall for a fake tweet, he still believes Trump voted for Obama in 2008. This, despite the fact Trump publicly endorsed John McCain in 2008 and was on a committee that raised money for him.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
