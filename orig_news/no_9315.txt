No greater fighter of amnesty than Jeff #AmnestyKiller,  —   Thomas Marchetti (@Ryanexpress77) February 29, 2016,  7:50: Red State Contributing Editor calls Sessions, who has stood up to the D. C. special interests and for American workers to fight comprehensive amnesty legislation and Obamatrade, an "unprincipled coward. " Hi @jeffsessions. You’re an unprincipled coward.  —   Ben Howe (@BenHowe) February 28, 2016,  Palin was referring to people like this last year:   pundits thinking it’s clever to mock Americans’ opinions are finding the joke is on them. Cozy in their seat of judgment, blowing each other’s horns, protected by a glass screen. Ask yourself: just who ARE these windbags? And what do they build? Towers of paperclips? Lists of Twitter followers? Trump’s supporters are delightedly defying pithy prim "opinion makers" who think Americans are incapable of choosing our leaders without their dictates. The more the   smear Trump, the more popular he gets. A friend emailed, "Tell those smart alecks bashing Trump on TV, ‘I love him because YOU hate him! ’" The GOP establishment would do well to listen to these voters and quit dismissing them. Reagan understood these   salt of the earth Americans. That’s why they gave him two landslide victories. If you want to win again, GOP, you need these good people. 7:40: Flashback: This guy sure knows what’s going on in the nation: What do you suppose his name rec is outside Alabama and DC? 3 percent? https:  .   —   John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) February 28, 2016,    7:30: Laura Ingraham: So now I suppose @SenatorSessions is also not a "real conservative"?  —   Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) February 28, 2016,  7:10: Mark "OZ" Geist and John "TIG" Tiegen —  two former Benghazi CIA contractors —  are endorsing Trump as well.

The American people can know with certainty, I will always place their interest above all else. I am the most militaristic person and it is so important to me to strengthen our military and protect American families and freedoms," Trump said. Mark "OZ" Geist said: "We, perhaps more than any Americans, know the absolute and imperative reason that we elect Donald J. Trump as President of the United States. First and foremost, under a Trump administration, the request for additional security by an ambassador would have been heeded, and second, there is no question, when the attack came, he would have moved heaven and earth to provide the necessary forces to protect and reinforce our warriors. Mr. Trump is the bold, decisive leader America needs at this time. " John Tiegen said: "It is very clear to see the groundswell of support, never seen before in recent politics. Americans want a strong leader, one who cares more about the safety and freedom of the American people than he does winning elections, or what the press might think. In honor of those we have fought with, I am proud to endorse the next President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

Jeff Sessions ( ). Sessions, the intellectual leader of the future of the conservative movement, has provided the brainpower behind the populist nationalist revolt against political elites that’s been emerging since at least 2013. At a warm and windy rally here with thousands present in a packed football stadium just outside Huntsville, Sessions will appear on stage with Trump to back him for president. Sessions’ endorsement provides Trump with even more legitimacy as Trump’s two remaining serious opponents —  Sens. Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) —  attempt to undermine him in a desperate bid by the donor class to regain control of the party from populists revolting in elections around the country. Sessions backing Trump is a significant blow to both Rubio and Cruz, as now the powerful Alabamian will be putting his entire operation all in behind Trump.
