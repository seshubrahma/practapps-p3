Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s senior policy adviser Stephen Miller is reacting to Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) endorsement of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. [Miller says Sanders’ endorsement is an example of "our rigged system," and pointed out several policy differences between Sanders and Clinton despite Sanders endorsement of the former secretary of state.  "Bernie Sanders will be endorsing one of the most     street, and   shoring candidates in the history of the Democratic Party," Miller’s statement began. It continued: The candidate who ran against special interests is endorsing the candidate who embodies special interests. The candidate who ran against TPP is endorsing the candidate who helped draft the TPP. The candidate who ran in opposition to globalization is running against the candidate who has led the push for globalization. The candidate who warned that open borders destroy the working class is endorsing the candidate with the most open borders policy in our history. The candidate who wants to reform   visas is endorsing the candidate who supported lifting the caps on   visas. The candidate who wants less war is endorsing the candidate who launched wars in Iraq and Libya and would lead us to a new war in Syria. The candidate who wants to get money out of politics is voting for the candidate who has made a career out of making money from politics. "Bernie’s endorsement becomes Exhibit A in our rigged system  —   the Democrat Party is disenfranchising its voters to benefit the select and privileged few," Miller continued.
