Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sarcastically thanked "the special interests and the lobbyists" for driving his numbers up at a press conference in Jupiter, FL on Tuesday.  Trump began by saying, "One of the things I’m most happy about is that the turnout has been just massive, for every week.   …     No matter where you go, it’s records. I think it’s actually the single biggest story in politics today. It’s what’s happening at the booth. The tremendous number of people that are coming out to vote. Some of the states are getting  —   in fact, one has 102% increase over four years ago. It’s amazing. 102%. On average, you’re talking about probably more than 50. You’re talking about millions and millions of people, whereas the Democrats are down 30, 35%. they’re down from what they were. We’re up by 50% and even more than that. You’re talking about millions of people. So, I actually think it’s the biggest story in politics today. And I hope that the republicans will embrace it. We have  —   don’t forget, we have Democrats coming over, very importantly. We have independents coming over, and they haven’t done that ever, probably ever. And with all of these people coming over, we’re going to have something very, very special. If I win, and if I get to go against Hillary, polls are showing that I beat her. And some of the polls have me beating her easily, because when you take advantage, we will take many, many people away from the Democrats. " He added, "I want to thank the special interests and the lobbyists. Because, they obviously did something to drive these numbers, I mean, we’re close to 50 and 40, and  —   no  —   but I want to congratulate them, because to raise that much money that quickly is a pretty good feat, right, do we agree? No, many of them are my friends, but they just have to gamble. " (  Real Clear Politics) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
