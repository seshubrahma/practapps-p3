Sunday on CBS’s "Face the Nation," when asked about   Donald Trump’s appearance on earlier in the day on "Fox News Sunday," host John Dickerson said Trump said the CIA’s conclusion that Russian hacking was involved in the 2016 U. S. presidential election was "ridiculous. "  However, Trump transition team senior adviser Kellyanne Conway clarified explaining Trump was saying the assertion that the Russians did so to help him win the election was what was "ridiculous. " Conway said, "What   Trump said is ridiculous is this idea that it was meant to help him become president of the United States. So there is no evidence of that. And if you go back and you listen to Clinton Campaign spokespeople on your program and others if you listen to the private briefings to media and others, they said very little about this. They were talking about  —   they were talking about how they were going to win the election before election day because of the early voting, false. They were going to have record turnout, if that were true they would have won. The  ’s point is that the conclusion all are making, some are making here that the interference went to affecting the relation, election results to defeat election is what he is calling ridiculous. " On Fox News Sunday Trump said, "I think it’s ridiculous. I think it’s just another excuse. I don’t believe it. I don’t know why, and I think it’s just  —   you know, they talked about all sorts of things. Every week it’s another excuse. We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the electoral college. I guess the final numbers are now at 306. She’s down to a very low number. No, I don’t believe that at all.
