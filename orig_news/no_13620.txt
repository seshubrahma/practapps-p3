I thought the roundtable was very insightful. I thought there were a lot of opinions represented, lots of thoughts and interest that really span the entire Charlotte community, no matter which area town you represent. I thought Ivanka Trump did a wonderful job in really sharing the platform, her mission, as we move forward throughout the election. There are things I learned from a personal standpoint, breaking down barriers. We have to dive in and listen to a person verses getting caught up in all the media that is put out there for TV. You really have to do your research. You really have to do your research. You have to understand the position of the political candidate. After a quick interview with local news and a group picture, it was off to the next state to campaign for her father. Ivanka will also campaign in Michigan Wednesday and New Hampshire on Thursday.
