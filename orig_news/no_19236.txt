’  ’ ’   At a rally on Saturday, Donald Trump suggested  —   with no evidence    —   that Hillary Clinton  and he proposed   that drug tests should be required before the next debate. ’ ’   "I’’m willing to do it," he said of mandatory   drug   testing. ’ ’   Clinton should take him up on the offer. ’ "   You may remember former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean got in some   trouble for  after he   sniffled his way through the first debate. Not unreasonably,   Trump’s supporters complained that this was a baseless   accusation. " ’   But now, Trump himself has chosen to put the "Who acts like they   are on drugs?" issue in play. And  —   like "Who’’s gropiest?"  —   it’’s   a question Trump shouldn’’t want the campaign to focus on. ’ ’’ ’   Clinton, after all, is not the candidate in this race whose mood   and energy level are wildly erratic. She is not the candidate who   goes on 3 a. m. . She is not the   candidate whose accusations against her opponents tend to be   projections of her own problems. And she is not the candidate   with a case of the sniffles. ’ ’   I am not saying Trump has a drug problem. He probably just has a   defective personality that causes him to behave as though he has   a drug problem. ’ ’   But, as Trump notes, the only way to tell for sure is if the   candidates take drug tests. ’
