Steele complained that the protesters caused her to walk nearly two miles in order to catch a flight to Houston and delayed her long enough for her to miss the flight. Steele felt exasperated enough to jump on her Instagram account and decry the protesters for causing "elderly and parents with small children" to have to walk long distances to reach flights. "I love witnessing people exercise their right to protest! But it saddened me to see the joy on their faces knowing that they were successful in disrupting so many people’s travel plans," she added.  But not long after posting her complaint, some of her sports reporter colleagues began to slam her for attacking the protesters.

I understand the inconvenience of missing a flight etc, but why people are protesting   inhumane   is much bigger than that. https:  .   —   Julie   (@JSB_TV) January 30, 2017,  Steele again replied that   must have missed the part where she said she supports people protesting for their political ideals and told   to   her Instagam post. Steele has engaged in political debate in the past. Last year she slammed the players protesting the national anthem, warning people to "look up the word democracy. " Hey @MikeEvans13_ look up definition of the word DEMOCRACY  remember this pic while   your right to protest #perspective pic. twitter.   —   Sage Steele (@sagesteele) November 14, 2016,  The ESPNer also slammed African Americans for attacking other African Americans for having opinions that run contrary to the   wisdom.
