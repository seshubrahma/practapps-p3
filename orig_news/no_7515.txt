Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is speaking out against a deadlocked Supreme Court decision that blocks President Barack Obama’s executive amnesty program. ["Today’s deadlocked decision from the Supreme Court is unacceptable, and show us all just how high the stakes are in this election," Clinton said in a statement that was released in both English and Spanish.  The divided Supreme Court decision means that a lower court ruling blocking the program remains in place. Clinton dismissed the ruling as "purely procedural" and reasserted her belief that Obama acted within his legal authority. But she took the occasion to warn illegal immigrants that Donald Trump would effectively end Obama’s executive amnesty. "This decision is also a stark reminder of the harm Donald Trump would do to our families, our communities, and our country," she said, reminding illegal immigrants of Trump’s plan to deport them. "Trump has pledged to repeal President Obama’s executive actions on his first day in office. " Clinton vowed to defend DAPA and DACA if elected president, assuring illegal immigrants that she would "do everything possible under the law" to protect them. She also condemned Republicans for failing to consider Obama’s nomination to the Supreme Court. "[T]his decision reminds us how much damage Senate Republicans are doing by refusing to consider President Obama’s nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court," she said.
