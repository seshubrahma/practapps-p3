On Monday, fifty Republican national security veterans released a letter saying that none of them will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. They said in their letter that Trump would be a "dangerous President" on foreign policy and national security. [Monday also marked the   anniversary of the war launched by the U. S. against Islamic State. NBC recently released a map showing the global expansion of Islamic State, showing how the U. S. policy to defeat them clearly has failed.  According to NBC: U. S. State Department documents indicated that in 2014, when the U. S. military began its campaign to destroy the extremists, there were only seven nations in which the fledgling state was operating. A map from the National Counterterrorism Center shows the worldwide expansion of ISIS as of August 2016. By 2015, according to the State Department’s own numbers, there were nearly double that  —   13 countries. The current briefing map shows 18 countries where  ISIS is fully operational. The map also displays a new category  —   "aspiring branches"  —   and lists six countries where  they’re taking root: Egypt, Indonesia, Mali, the Philippines, Somalia and Bangladesh. We are currently facing a humanitarian catastrophe in the Middle East not seen since WWII. In 1945, Democratic President Harry Truman used the atomic bomb against the Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ending WWII, killing over 150, 000 people. Truman stated that he did it to save lives and end the war. He argued that it wasn’t an option to prolong the war resulting in more bloodshed. President Obama has done nothing in the Syrian conflict and little in the global war on Islamic State, which has resulted in over 400, 000 deaths in Syria alone and displacing millions under his Presidency. Prolonging the war costs lives and money. A   foreign policy as we have seen under President Obama and Hillary’s State Department is dangerous, not Donald Trump. Donald Trump would win and end the war against Islamic State, ultimately saving lives. It is Hillary Clinton that has a proven record of a dangerous foreign policy. As Secretary of State, she has a consistent track record of supporting our enemies and alienating our allies. A short list of Hillary’s policies that have jeopardized American national security include: undermining the service and sacrifice of thousands of men and women in uniform by reaching out to the Taliban in Afghanistan while they were killing American troops supporting the withdrawal of American troops in Iraq which led to the creation of Islamic State supporting the Muslim Brotherhood (a designated terrorist organization in Egypt, UAE and Saudi Arabia) throughout the Middle East and in the United States which undermined America’s Muslim allies refusing to designate the Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organization in Nigeria undermining the democratic Iranian Green Revolution in 2009 and supporting the Iran Nuclear deal. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton refused to designate Islamic State affiliate Boko Haram in Nigeria, which was named the deadliest terrorist organization in 2015, a terrorist group. She not only refused, but she hindered the efforts of Members of Congress who were trying to make the designation. The FBI, CIA and Justice Department wanted Boko Haram designated but, ultimately, the State Department opposed the designation despite hard evidence from our Intelligence services. Clinton’s refusal to designate them a FTO could be because of conflict of interest with the Clinton Foundation and a Nigerian businessman. Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian businessman with Lebanese dual citizenship and land developer, gave $5 million dollars to the Clinton Foundation throughout the years and pledged $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative in 2009 through the Chagoury Group. He hosted former President Bill Clinton in Nigeria as head of the Clinton Foundation. Chagoury would have a financial interest in the impact on Nigeria that would have followed a FTO designation. The FTO designation would affect his developments in Nigeria. Boko Haram is responsible for kidnapping over 260 young female students in 2014. If the designation for Boko Haram occurred sooner, the search for the girls could have started sooner. Boko Haram gained significant footing and expanded during Clinton’s time as Secretary of State. Boko Haram has killed more than 20, 000 people and displaced 2 million. Hillary calls herself a "champion of women’s rights," but did not designate Boko Haram a terrorist organization despite being responsible for killing and kidnapping thousands of people, including women and children, using them as sex slaves and suicide bombers. One of the most strategic consequential failures of the Hillary State Department was in 2009 when the U. S. undermined the Iranian Green Revolution. Not only did the U. S. do nothing to help the opposition against the terrorist Iranian regime, but US funding was cut for democratic   in Iran under Clinton’s State Department. Democracy funding under the State Department continued in countries like Egypt, where the US supported "democratic" opposition groups which led to the removal of US ally Mubarak, but were cut for opposition groups that were   against a terrorist regime. According to a Wall Street Journal article published in October 2009, democratic organizations that were funded under the Bush Administration were cut under Hillary’s State Department. The article states, Less widely known is that Freedom House, the nonpartisan watchdog group founded in 1941, also lost State Department funding. It applied in April for significant funds to support initiatives including Gozaar, its   online journal of democracy and human rights, and was turned down in July. Since 2006, Freedom House had received over $2 million from the U. S. and European governments for   efforts. "We might have to close Gozaar if we run out of money," deputy executive director Thomas O. Melia told us this week  …    then there’s the International Republican Institute (IRI) which for several years received State Department support to train Iranian reformers and connect them to   activists in Europe and elsewhere. IRI’s recent application for funds was denied, an IRI official told us last week. The article continued saying, "In a recent letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about Iran policy, seven congressmen including Chris Smith (R. N. J.) Bob Inglis (R. S. C.) and James Moran (D. Va.) wrote: ‘We are particularly concerned by reports that the State Department and USAID are being ‘extremely cautious’ in their funding decisions, have stopped funding projects, and have approved no new strategy for promoting civil society and the rule of law.’ Mrs. Clinton has not responded. " The war in Libya is another one of Hillary’s greatest foreign policy mistakes, leading to thousands killed and millions displaced. Gaddafi was not a good man, but he had a stake in the global war on terrorism after he allegedly dismantled his nuclear program in 2003. In 2007, the United States removed Libya from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and resumed normal diplomatic relations. Under Gaddafi, Islamists were consistently trying to overthrow his regime, so he had an interest in standing up against Islamist terrorists, using state force against them. Libyan intelligence worked with the CIA and the US intelligence during the Iraq war to arrest members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) who had pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda. The LIFG has been a U. S. designated terrorist organization since 2004. According to a West Point study conducted in 2007, Libya contributed far more foreign fighters in Iraq to fight American troops per capita than any other country. It was Hillary Clinton’s State Department that gave a contract to the February 17th Martyrs Brigade in Libya to protect America’s Consulate, who were known sympathizers to Al Qaeda and are main suspects in the Benghazi attack on the U. S. consulate that killed U. S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. In Afghanistan, Hillary undermined American and Afghan troops by leading and spearheading the negotiations with the Taliban, pushing for an office in Qatar while the Taliban refused. She led negotiations with the Taliban while they were killing American troops. As Secretary of State, the US failed to secure the Status of Forces Agreement in Iraq, leaving a vacuum for ISIS  —   undermining the sacrifice that thousands of Americans gave in securing victory in the war. In Yemen, Hillary Clinton met with one of the leading members of the opposition, Tawakkol Karman, who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in Yemen and was a leader in the overthrow of President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s regime. Hillary Clinton stated, ""the United States supports a democratic transition in Yemen and the rights of the people of Yemen  —   men and women  —   to choose their own leaders and futures. "  The White House issued a statement supporting the United Nations Security Council’s Resolution that called for a peaceful transition in Yemen, stating, "a united and unambiguous signal to President Saleh that he must respond to the aspirations of the Yemeni people by transferring power immediately. " Today, Yemen is a failed state and fighting a proxy war, another disaster of Hillary’s Arab Spring. The Middle East is on fire because of Hillary Clinton’s State Department and the Obama Administration’s policies of fighting against the rule of law and supporting those that break the law  —   creating anarchy and safe havens for terrorists. Hillary will bring anarchy and lawlessness, which she has already done as Secretary of State. Hillary Clinton is dangerous for America’s national security, not Donald Trump. Tera Dahl is the Executive Director of the Council on Global Security.
