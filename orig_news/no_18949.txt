’  ’ ’   CLEVELAND  —   Donald Trump’’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort   said tech billionaire Peter Thiel’’s speech has nothing to do with   his "sexual preference" during a Sunday press briefing in   Cleveland for the week’’s Republican National Convention. ’ ’   Thiel is the first openly gay RNC speaker since 2000. ’ ’   "Peter Thiel is speaking because he knows Donald Trump, and he’’ll   be speaking about the Donald Trump, the man he knows," Manafort   told a conference room packed with reporters. "And as a   successful entrepreneur, he can speak from a standard that we   think is important for the American people to hear." ’ ’   "As far as his sexual preference, as chairman [Reince] Priebus   has said, this is an open tent party, and people are going to be   speaking at this convention based on what they want to say, not   on any particular sexual preference and things like that," he   continued. "So I think that’’s the basis for why he’’s on the   program." ’ ’   Manafort was also asked if the presumptive Republican nominee   agreed with the Republican platform drafted last week, which   included provisions that were widely critiqued as     including being in opposition to   marriage. ’ ’’ ’   "Mr. Trump embraces the platform, praised many aspects of the   platform, he’’s praised many of the positions in the campaign and   those positions are well known," Manafort said. ’ "   Trump has largely refrained from staking out positions on LGBTQ   issues, but claimed after the massacre at a gay nightclub in   Orlando last month that he would keep gay and lesbian Americans   safe. Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, came under   fire last year for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Many   deemed that law to be discriminatory to LGBTQ Americans, and   Pence later signed an amendment to the legislation. "
