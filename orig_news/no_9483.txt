China’s finance minister Lou Jiwei slammed GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for the real estate mogul’s trade policy in an interview published Sunday. ["Don’t take the rhetoric in a presidential campaign too seriously. Trump is an irrational type," Lou said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.  He also said Trump’s trade policy would conflict with the World Trade Organization’s international rules. Trump has suggested there should be tariffs on goods coming into the United States from China, but critics say those tariffs could result in a trade war.
