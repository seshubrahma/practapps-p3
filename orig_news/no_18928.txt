’  ’ ’   Donald Trump entertained the idea of not serving as president if   he won the November general election in a  published Thursday. ’ ’   The Times brought up the scenario, asking whether Trump might go   through the general election and win the presidency "only to   forgo the office as the ultimate   winner." ’ ’   In response to the hypothetical scenario, Trump "flashed a   mischievous smile," according to The Times. ’ ’   "I’’ll let you know how I feel about it after it happens," he then   said. ’ ’   To be fair, The Times noted that it’’s "entirely possible that Mr.   Trump is playing coy to earn more news coverage." But considering   Trump’’s unconventional path to winning the Republican   presidential nomination, and his background as a billionaire   businessman rather than a public servant, some have questioned   whether Trump really wants the presidency. ’ ’’ ’   Thomas Barrack Jr. a   investor who is close friends   with Trump, told The Times that he’’s "not going to pull out." And   Roger Stone, a longtime political adviser of Trump’’s, told the   newspaper that Trump would definitely serve if he won. ’ ’   "I’’m fairly certain about that," Stone said. "You think he’’d   resign? I don’’t see that happening. There is only one star in the   Donald Trump show, and that’’s Donald Trump." ’ ’   Trump will run against Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of   state and senator from New York. ’ ’   Business Insider asked Trump’’s campaign whether he is   actually considering giving up the presidency if he wins the   election. Here’’s spokeswoman Hope Hicks’’ response: "Mr.   Trump is running for President to Make America Great Again. He   looks forward to defeating Hillary Clinton in the fall and doing   everything he can to accomplish that." ’
