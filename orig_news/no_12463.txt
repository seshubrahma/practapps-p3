  Donald Trump’s spokesman Jason Miller says news and rumors about potential Russian hackers interfering with the U. S. election are an attempt to delegitimize Trump’s victory. [Miller responded to news headlines on Monday, where there’s speculation about potential Russian hacking into the U. S. election, as well as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s statement earlier on Monday morning that he, along with a group of bipartisan senators, supports a probe into the potential Russian action.  "Any foreign breach of our cyber security measures is disturbing and I strongly condemn any such efforts," McConnell stated during a press conference on Monday in Washington, D. C. adding, "The Russians are not our friends. " "Going back to this overall narrative that is in the news right now, I think really clearly what this is, is an attempt to try to delegitimize   Trump’s win," Miller stated, responding to a question about McConnell’s statement. "That really seems to be what is going on here. " Miller continued: "First after the election, it was the recount nonsense, then it was discussion of the popular vote and now it’s anonymous,    sources with conflicting information, trying to raise other issues. But really, where we are as an incoming administration is getting ready to serve the American people and hit the ground running. " Miller vowed keep the focus on helping American taxpayers and making good on campaign promises. "That might upset some people who are bitter that their candidate lost in November, but that’s not going to slow us down on focusing on going to work for the American people," he says.
