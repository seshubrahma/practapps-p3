Sunday on NBC’s "Meet the Press," Sen. Tom Cotton ( ) said presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had "disqualified herself as   " and cited her "cavalier attitude" on the nation’s secrecy laws as the reason.  Partial transcript as follows: CHUCK TODD: In many ways what you outline is a foreign policy is the exact opposite of Donald Trump and seems really closer to Hillary Clinton or Hillary Clinton seems closer to you. How do you explain that? SEN. COTTON: Well, I can show you that I’m not very close to Hillary Clinton. I think she’s disqualified herself as     by her cavalier attitude toward the nation’s secrecy laws and been responsible for many of the worst decisions of the Obama administration. She was literally president when we pressed the reset button with Russia just a few months after Russia invaded Georgia. In 2011 when our commander said they needed more troops in Iraq and when every Iraqi leader wanted a new agreement to keep our troops there she couldn’t achieve that even though she was secretary of state. And she was the strongest advocate inside the Obama administration for the Libyan misadventure which led to the strongest ISIS cell around the world. So I’m far from a supporter of Hillary Clinton.
