Sunday on ABC’s "This Week," while discussing the possibility of   Donald Trump picking former Gov. Mitt Romney ( ) as secretary of state,  senior adviser for Trump’s transition team Kellyanne Conway said Romney "went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump. "  Conway said, "I weigh in privately. First of all, let me make clear that there’s one person who will select his cabinet and it’s   Donald Trump. Whatever he decides will have my full support and respect and he knows that, as does Vice   Pence. I think there was the Never Trump movement and then there was Governor Mitt Romney. He went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump. He gave two speeches that I can recall in this calendar year and they both were about Donald Trump. Evan McMullin ran in the state of Utah. We don’t know who Mitt Romney voted for. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
