’  ’ ’   About two weeks ago, Daniel Moore received a cryptic phone call. ’ ’   The    resident of Newton Falls, Ohio was told that   a billionaire philanthropist from California wanted to meet and   have dinner with his family. ’ ’   "I thought it was a prank phone call," Moore told Business   Insider during a recent interview. "I almost hung up. " ’ "   Moore pressed the person on the other end of the phone to reveal   his employer’s identity. While the staffer refused to give a   name, he teased that 90% of Americans use his boss’s product   every day. Moore agreed to the visit. " ’   A few days later, another staffer showed up at Moore’’s house for   a "preliminary visit." He walked around Moore’’s property, took   pictures, and asked to come inside and help decide where his boss   would have dinner with Moore’’s family. ’ "   After a few more days of planning that involved the billionaire’s   staff arranging the dinner menu and catering from a local   restaurant, another employee arrived at Moore’s house on the   evening of the planned visit. Moore was informed that the   identity of his mystery dinner guest would be revealed just 15   minutes before he arrived. " "   And like clockwork, 15 minutes after Moore was finally   told the name of his guest, a convoy of black SUVs drove   through Moore’s quiet neighborhood, pulled into his driveway, and   parked in his front yard. " ’   Out stepped Mark Zuckerberg. ’ ’  ’ ’   Facebook’’s    CEO has given himself a personal goal of   visiting the roughly 30 U. S. states he hasn’’t been to yet by the   end of 2017. The reason why? To "get out and talk to more people   about how they’’re living, working and thinking about the future,"   he wrote in a Facebook post from January. ’ ’   Moore, who works in a   steel mill as an engineer,   described Zuckerberg as a "real down to earth, outgoing guy" with   "good manners" who asked to take his shoes off before he entered   the house. ’ "   The guest list included Moore’s wife and kids, as well as a few   local friends. " ’   Moore wanted to seat the Facebook CEO at the head of the table,   but a staffer told him that Zuckerberg preferred otherwise. "He   does not feel comfortable at the head. Moore recalls being told. So   instead Zuckerberg sat at the middle of the dining room table,   with his staff in the kitchen, pecking away at their laptops   during the meal. ’ ’   As everyone ate dinner over plastic plates, Moore asked   Zuckerberg to explain what brought him to northeast Ohio. ’ ’   Zuckerberg said he was on a "  mission," according to   Moore, and that last year it "dawned on me that I don’t know my   own country." ’ ’   The elephant in the room quickly became President   Trump. Moore is a   political activist and   independent who voted for Obama twice before voting for Trump.   His wife Lisa is a school teacher who also voted for Trump on his   promise to abolish Common Core. ’ ’   After Zuckerberg asked them why they had voted for Trump, Moore   turned the tables and asked if Zuckerberg had spoken with Trump   since he was elected. Zuckerberg, who was  in   December, said he had in fact talked with Trump multiple times on   the phone. ’ ’  ’ "   Zuckerberg’s       tour immediately sparked more speculation that he was   preparing to run for president, a rumor that’s refused to die   over the past year. " "   Zuckerberg has helped fuel the speculation by regularly posting   photos on his Facebook page that look like they’re from   a campaign trail. He’s been photographed working the   assembly line at a Michigan Ford factory, hanging out with   firefighters, and even feeding a calf on a farm in rural Ohio. " ’   But if there’’s one message Zuckerberg and his dozens of staffers   want to get across, it’’s that this U. S. tour is not an elaborate   publicity stunt designed to set the stage for his eventual run   for office. After his surprise dinner with Zuckerberg last week,   Daniel Moore said he was instructed by the CEO’’s spokeswoman to   "hammer home" to anyone who asked that Zuckerberg had no   aspirations to make a presidential bid. ’ ’   Even still, Zuckerberg has surrounded himself with numerous   former government officials who accompany him on his trips. ’ "   Amy Dudley, the chief spokeswoman for his philanthropic fund The   Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, was previously the communications   director for Hillary Clinton’s running mate and Virginia senator   Tim Kaine. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s director of travel   operations, James Eby, previously served in the same role for the   Department of Defense. " "   The list even extends to Zuckerberg’s personal photographer,    who worked for the White House during both Obama   terms. The eight bodyguards and roughly   aides who   accompanied Zuckerberg to Moore’s house for dinner were all   identified as former Secret Service members, Moore told Business   Insider. " ’   Zuckerberg himself has publicly said that he has no plans to run   for president. He shared the same sentiment in private to Moore   and his family over dinner last week. ’ ’   "I have absolutely no interest in running for president of the   United States. ," Moore recalled Zuckerberg saying. "I’m very   happy running my own company. I believe I can make a huger impact   through my company and through the initiatives I’m rolling out." ’ ’  ’ ’   Clad in his trademark gray   Zuckerberg discussed his   remarkable journey from the Harvard dorm room where he created   Facebook thirteen years ago. ’ ’   "Never in my wildest dreams did I think Facebook would be where   it is today, I never expected to make this amount of money,"   Moore says Zuckerberg told him. ’ "   Zuckerberg has committed to giving away 99% of his roughly $60   billion net worth through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which   he runs with his wife Priscilla Chan. He’s so far invested in   education startups and pledged $3 billion to aide curing the   world’s diseases. " ’   "Just think, if I was in Washington D. C. how much could I do?"   Moore remembered Zuckerberg saying over dinner. "How much   progress could I make there?" ’ ’   A Chan Zuckerberg spokesperson said that while some   of  trips are organized by   Facebook, many are organized through his fund as a way to see   potential areas of investment. ’ ’   "The chance to meet people in communities across the country   informs work being done by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to   advance human potential and promote equality in communities   across the country," the told   Business Insider. ’ "   Zuckerberg’s visit to Ohio last week included a community   college’s machine learning lab, an   opioid addiction clinic, and a juvenile detention   center, according to the spokesperson. Each of the stops could be   seen as hints towards areas of future investments. The   spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of what   Zuckerberg said at Moore’s house or why they were selected for a   visit. " "   While Moore admitted to knowing little about Zuckerberg   before the visit, he says he is a frequent user of Facebook. And   he’s now one of the CEO’s 90 million followers on the social   network. " ’   "There’s a lot more to Mark Zuckerberg than just Facebook," he   said. ’ ’About two weeks ago, Daniel Moore received a. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
