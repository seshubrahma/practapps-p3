Monday on Laura Ingraham’s nationally syndicated radio show, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan discussed the possibility of the United States escalating its involvement in the Syrian civil war days after President Donald Trump launched a military strike on a Syrian airbase in responding to the Syrian government’s alleged use of chemical weapons.  Buchanan noted the biggest cheerleaders of Trump’s action were Sens. John McCain ( ) Lindsey Graham ( ) and Marco Rubio ( ) which he deemed to be "the war party. " However, argued that they would not "get the war they want" from Trump. "It’s McCain and Graham and Marco Rubio  —   the war party," Buchanan said. "But let me say this, Laura  —   my view is they’re not going to get the war they want. If Donald Trump the president takes us into Syria’s civil war and he’s already made the first strike  —   it will consume his presidency. And the sense I get this morning and listening to some of these folks on yesterday’s show is that, ‘Don’t worry, this is just a  . We’re not going into Syria. The enemy is still ISIS, as indeed it is if you take a look at what happened in Egypt yesterday, 47 dead and 100 injured. " "So I think the war party is going to be frustrated because I cannot believe that Donald Trump on second thought is going to plunge us into Syria, which he told us again and again and again would be an act of folly  —   that our enemy is ISIS and our enemy is   and that we should finish them off," he added. "Then we’re necessarily going to have to work with the folks who did most of the heavy lifting in finishing them off. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
