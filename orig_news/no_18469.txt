’  ’ "   More than three dozen House Democrats want to shut off Jared   Kushner’s access to classified information in light of increased   scrutiny by the FBI over Kushner’s contacts with Russian   authorities. " ’   House Democrats said they want Kushner’’s security clearance   revoked "to protect national security." ’ ’   The lawmakers outlined their concerns in a letter to White House   general counsel Don McGahn on Wednesday. ’ ’   "While the various congressional and law enforcement   investigations continue, the White House should take all possible   steps to protect national security including immediately revoking   Mr. Kushner’’s security clearance," the letter read. ’ "   That request, if granted, would be an extraordinary step in the   ongoing congressional investigation of the Trump campaign’s   communications with Russia  —   and the FBI’s inquiry of Kushner’s   talks with the Kremlin, which have gained greater significance in   recent weeks.

Don Beyer of   Virginia, who also signed the letter. ’ "   The Trump administration has downplayed concerns about Kushner’s   talks with the Russians.
