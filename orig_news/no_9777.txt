Donald Trump has officially won the state of Michigan, making him the first Republican to do so since George H. W. Bush in 1988. [In the tightest race in Michigan’s electoral history, Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 10, 704 votes after results from all 83 of the state’s county clerks were counted and certified.  This brings Donald Trump’s electoral vote total to 306. Hillary Clinton’s is 232. "Many people have asked about Michigan’s process for counting ballots and certifying election results. Please be aware that all 1, 521 Michigan cities and townships completed ballot counting and reported unofficial results by the morning of Wednesday, Nov. 9," a statement on the Michigan Secretary of State website reads. "The county canvassing boards, as they do after every election, then began their work to review and certify the results from each precinct," it continued. Part of Trump’s success in typically Democratic Rust Belt states, such as Michigan, was due to his promise to return jobs to the region, emphasizing his plans to bring back investment from companies that have moved overseas. The idea that Hillary Clinton could lose Michigan only sunk in during the last weeks of the campaign, where she visited places such as Grand Rapids and Detroit, while President Obama was sent to campaign in Ann Arbor. Meanwhile, Michigan remains one of the states where Green Party candidate Jill Stein is demanding a recount, having already raised $3. 5 million to pay for recounts in states such as Michigan, Wisconsin,  and Pennsylvania.
