 (CNN) Rep. Chris Collins,   York, said Tuesday he agrees with FBI Director James Comey’s decision to not recommend charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server at the State Department. Collins, the first member of Congress to back Donald Trump, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room" that on the FBI’s decision, he agrees with Comey    not Trump.   "Director Comey is one of the better appointments that President Obama has made and I accept what he said that while her actions may not have been intended, it shows extremely poor judgment," Collins said. That marks a stark contrast with the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s response on Twitter, where he declared "the system is rigged" and called the decision "very very unfair."  In a subsequent tweet, Trump wrote: "FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem."  Comey strongly rebuked Clinton in a news conference Tuesday morning, saying the former secretary of state and her aides were "extremely careless" in the handling of classified information. But he also said the FBI had determined that "no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case." "We need a president that shows good judgment," Collins told Blitzer, adding that "lying seems to be a Clinton family trait."
