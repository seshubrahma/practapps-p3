Sunday on CNN’s "State of the Union," while discussing Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein initiating recounts of the presidential vote in the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton supporting the effort, former Democratic primary candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said, "No one expects there to be profound change. "  Sanders said, "It’s taking place. The Green Party has the legal right to do it. We have recounts probably almost every election. No one expects there to be profound change. But there’s nothing wrong with going through the process. " He added, "The green party has the legal right. Republicans have requested   —   I think the governor of North Carolina right now is thinking about doing recount. That’s a legal right. They do it. I don’t think that Hillary Clinton who got 2 million more votes than Mr. Trump in the popular election, said it’s going to transform the election. Do people that have legal right to do it? Yeah they do. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
