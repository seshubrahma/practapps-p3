JUST IN: Bernie Sanders says he won’t ask for recount of Missouri’s #SuperTuesday, Hillary Clinton wins. No declared winner in GOP. @KTAR923,  —   Martha Maurer (@MaurerMartha) March 17, 2016,  6:23: Trump’s Senior Policy Adviser says that Trump will hammer Clinton on trade and will frame Clinton as a candidate who is siding with Wall Street and big business. Miller says the GOP establishment and members of the conservative industrial complex are lining up behind Cruz because "they don’t want anything in Washington to change. " 6:20: Miller: If Lindsey Graham writes a book it should be titled How to Shrink the Republican Party. He says Graham is the expert in shrinking the Republican Party and wonders if Cruz will reject his endorsement. Miller says Graham came up with the foreign policy that ruined the GOP and the immigration policies that have hollowed out the middle class and made the party less attractive to   voters. 6:18: Miller says the GOP has been shrinking by pushing away   voters and the GOP should embrace the opportunity to grow. He says the campaign is building a bigger Republican Party by embracing   voters that have not felt at home in either party. Miller says the "rich and powerful" are panicking because they are losing control of the GOP and Trump is returning the party to the people. 6:08: Trump Senior Adviser: Conservative Industrial Complex Worried ‘Gravy Train’ Will Shut Down if Trump Gets Nomination. On CNN, Trump’s Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller says the campaign is feeling "very confident" they can secure the nomination before the convention. Regarding members of the conservative industrial complex who are plotting a   run, Miller says that they are trying to deny tens of millions of patriotic Americans control of their economic futures. Miller says these people are worried that the "gravy train" will shut down if Trump gets the nominee. Miller says their motivation is "selfish, economic interests" like bad   amnesty deals Trump’s voters are revolting against. Miller says, "to be candid, most people watching today are thinking, ‘who is Erick Erickson? ’" Miller says the reality is that the average Republican voter has been killed by the offshoring of jobs, open borders, and a terrible foreign policy. He says they are saying "please, give us relief from these terrible policies. " Miller says people are "terrified" and "desperate" that they are losing control of a party they thought they controlled. Miller says the steelworker —  not the person with a $2 million salary lobbying Washington and members of the conservative industrial complex —  will be in charge if Trump win the White House. Miller says the "stop Trump" movement is about one thing  —   "people trying to retain their own power.

Naturally people in politics feel threatened by it at every level and for all kinds of reasons, but there are people in media who feel threatened by this. Trump is showing he’s better than practically anybody in media in attracting an audience, in holding an audience, and he doesn’t need a producer and he doesn’t need a writer or writers and he doesn’t need a director. There’s a whole lot of people threatened by this on a whole lot of different levels. Like I discussed yesterday, Donald Trump has turned the standard operating political formula upside down. There’s a formula in professional politics about how you get elected. You have to hire a consultant. You have to hire pollsters. You have to hire data analytics people. You have to hire spokesmen. You have to hire     people. I mean, you have to hire, hire, hire, hire, and then you have to get the best who do what they do, and you have to listen to them. You have to plan to the Nth detail every minute of the day, every appearance. Trump’s done none of it and has, in the process, illustrated that may  —   if I were in the professional politics business, I would feel so threatened right now because I’m looking at somebody who has demonstrated that my expertise isn’t necessary. I would think, if I’m a consultant, if I’m a spokesman, if I’m a policy analyst, I’d look at this whole Trump phenomenon and go, "I’m not needed. People are gonna realize it. People are gonna realize I’m not needed. " Let’s say you’re a foreign policy advisor for candidate X. Trump doesn’t have any. He’s leading the pack. So it’s no wonder he’s gonna be criticized for everything he’s doing. People have turf to be protected here, folks. This is huge, what’s happening here, in all kinds of ways. So explaining the anger, the envy, the resentment, the jealousy, the fear, I mean, it’s all there. People are afraid of Trump, people are envious, people are jealous, people are frightened, people are fearful, people are threatened. It depends on where you go, but all those facets are accurate, and it’s upsetting and unnerving, which is why so many of these people are hoping and praying that Trump implodes. They are hoping and praying that Trump loses in a landslide. They are hoping that disaster comes to Trump, because if disaster comes to Trump in one way or another they will be validated as still necessary. They’ll be able to say, "Trump, he tried to do it without us. He tried to do it without a consultant. See what happens to you? He tried to do it without a good spokesman. See what happens you? He tried to do it without a foreign policy. See what happens to you? He tried to do it without the pollsters. " That’s what they want to be able to say down the road. Here’s another thing that scares them. Trump is improv. (interruption) What are you whispering about in there? What are you whispering about in there? No, I’m serious. He is improv. There is no speechwriter. That’s another group of people that aren’t employed by the Trump campaign. There’s no writer. And have you noticed other campaigns where there are speechwriters, have you noticed no matter when the candidate speaks, it’s the same speech? It’s called the stump speech. And have you noticed that it’s practically    at every stop. 3:53: Sanders campaign manager tells MSNBC that "this race is going all the way to the convention" and by June 7, "we will pass Secretary Clinton in pledged delegates.

Rep. Raul Grijalva ( ) ad for Sanders in Arizona,  1:56: Failed, stale, unimaginative consultants and   influence peddlers in the Twitter world want to blame the media for the rise of Trump. Not so fast. As Howard Kurtz points out:  The current complaints center on the fantasy notion that news organizations have failed to aggressively report on Trump. But I have read hundreds of articles, and watched thousands of segments, about Trump’s business setbacks his casino bankruptcies allegations of mob ties and racial discrimination the use of foreign workers to staff his properties and make his merchandise how he gave large sums to Democrats, including Hillary Clinton how he changed from liberal positions on abortion and health care even accusations that he cheats at golf. I have consumed many   efforts about erroneous or questionable statements he has made, about how much Medicare spends on prescription drugs, or having watched reports of thousands of Muslims celebrating on   in New Jersey. I have read or seen a long line of commentators accusing Trump of being racist, sexist, misogynist, xenophobic, of being ignorant on policy, of encouraging violence. And yet he keeps winning primaries. The negative media attention and   attempts bounce off him like rubber arrows. There are limits, it turns out, to the mighty power of the press. Voters don’t much trust the media these days, and they get to decide which candidates they like. Another former member of the mainstream media elite —  Marc Ambinder —  also had some takes on this. He rightly points out that the media should have tried to understand why ordinary Americans were drawn to Trump’s message: I wish the media tried to understand, earlier, why ordinary Americans who aren’t really Republicans seem to like Trump.  —   Marc Ambinder (@marcambinder) March 16, 2016,  But again.

We call for a unity ticket that unites the Republican Party.  If that unity ticket is unable to get 1, 237 delegates prior to the convention, we recognize that it took Abraham Lincoln three ballots at the Republican convention in 1860 to become the party’s nominee and if it is good enough for Lincoln, that process should be good enough for all the candidates without threats of riots. We encourage all former Republican candidates not currently supporting Trump to unite against him and encourage all candidates to hold their delegates on the first ballot. Lastly, we intend to keep our options open as to other avenues to oppose Donald Trump.  Our multiple decades of work in the conservative movement for free markets, limited government, national defense, religious liberty, life, and marriage are about ideas, not necessarily parties. 1:12: Data.

"I do wish that O’Reilly had defended me more in his interview with Trump," Kelly told More Magazine. "I would have defended him more. " Kelly was referring to an interview from January when Trump told O’Reilly that he had "zero respect" for Kelly, and described her as "highly overrated.
