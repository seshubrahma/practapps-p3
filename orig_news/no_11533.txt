A New York teacher is facing backlash after she called her students "racist" in a Facebook post. [The post, which has since been deleted, read, "This week is spirit week at Smithtown HS West. It’s easy to spot which students are racist by the Trump gear they’re sporting for USA Day. "  Students at Smithtown High School West shared differing opinions on Veronica Welsh’s Facebook post. "She made a mistake by putting the school’s name in it," one student told CBS 2. "But she has a right to her opinion. " "It’s not a good idea because then like she influences the students with the same ideas," another said. The school’s superintendent called the incident unfortunate and said the post was highly inappropriate. Parents also chimed in long after the original Facebook post was taken down. "There’s no reason for her to pass judgement on those kids on a social platform," one parent told CBS 2. "I’m not big on social media, but I think that in the classroom they need to show both sides," another said. Welsh did not respond to media requests from the station nor did she show up in class on Friday. Welsh has been "administratively reassigned," and the superintendent said appropriate disciplinary action has been taken, but she remains employed by the school.
