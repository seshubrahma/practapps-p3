This week’s "Saturday Night Live" on NBC opened with   campaign coverage. Beck Bennett, playing the role of CNN host Jake Tapper, cut to the Dr. Ben Carson endorsement of GOP presidential   Donald Trump.  Darrell Hammond, playing Trump, said, "My guest today is so tremendous. Dr. Ben Carson is a very special man. And for once, I don’t mean that as an insult to the mentally challenged. " Jay Pharoah as Dr. Carson then said, "Yes, Donald and I are very different. We’re like night and day, ebony and orangey. Sure, we’ve had our  —   you know, we’ve had our polite disagreements. I question his knowledge on health care, and he called me a psycho and a child molester. " After the endorsement, "CNN" cut to Larry David playing Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) who discussed his campaign. "I have the voters, my message is resonating with a very diverse group of white people. And I have supporters of all ages,      . That’s it. The young people love me, Tapper, because I’m like them. I have a lot of big plans, and absolutely no idea how to achieve them," he stated. Bennett then cut back to the fake Trump rally after an "incident of violence" where Dr. Carson was mistaken for a protestor and had suffered an apparent injury. "Guys, what did I say? Not this one. This is one of the good ones!" Hammond’s Trump proclaimed. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
