On the eve of our debut episode of "The Daily," President Trump delivered a major news story. For his first Supreme Court nomination, he selected Neil M. Gorsuch, a conservative judge with a sterling résumé. I spent the night in the studio talking with some of my most insightful New York Times colleagues about what it means. Maggie Haberman, a White House reporter, explains Mr. Trump’s reverence for the Supreme Court. Carl Hulse, the dean of congressional reporters, explains what to expect during the confirmation process. And Adam Liptak, our chief legal correspondent, introduces the country’s new Supreme Court nominee. To understand more about Judge Gorsuch, I also talk to David Green, the chief executive of Hobby Lobby, a company at the center of one of Judge Gorsuch’s most important cases. He ruled that corporations with religious owners  —   like Hobby Lobby  —   cannot be required to pay for insurance coverage for contraception. "We voted for Trump, not that we agree with everything he does," Mr. Green tells me on the show, speaking for himself and his wife. "The most important thing to us was the fact that we knew he would put someone there that ruled on the Constitution," he said, referring to the Supreme Court. "Because if you rule on the Constitution, it would be obvious that we would not have to be forced to do something, and that we would have our religious liberties.
