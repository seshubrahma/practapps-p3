Sen. Marco Rubio repeatedly mocked Donald Trump today in Dallas  —   hitting the billionaire from multiple angles, including his typos on Twitter. [Rubio pulled out his smartphone and read Trump’s multiple tweets that called him a "chocker" to a raucous crowd of supporters who cheered him on for taking on the billionaire candidate.  He also mocked Trump, alleging he was "having a meltdown" during the debate, accusing him of putting makeup on his "sweat mustache" and asking for a full length mirror during the break. "I don’t know why   …     maybe he was trying to make sure his pants weren’t wet," Rubio grinned. "It’s time to pull his mask off," he continued, insisting that the billionaire was a " " who presided over multiple failures during his business career and hired foreign workers. Rubio also pointed out that Trump was defending organizations like Planned Parenthood using the same arguments as Harry Reid. "The charade is up! This is a con job," said Rubio. He also mocked Trump for repeatedly acting like a "tough guy" even though he was the first presidential candidate that "begged for Secret Service protection" and said he wanted to punch a protester in the face. "Donald Trump has never punched anyone in the face," he said as his supporters laughed. Rubio also pointed out that Trump had inherited $200 million which helped him be successful. Without that, Rubio mocked, Trump would be "selling watches in Time Square" or "doing one of those infomercials" to flip properties. "We unmasked him last night and let me tell you it’s time for you to unmask him as well," he replied, urging supporters to convince their friends that Trump was a mistake. Friends don’t let friends vote for con artists, he said.
