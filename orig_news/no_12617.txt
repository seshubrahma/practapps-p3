Breitbart News has compiled a list of criminal incidents across the nation from the month of September, 2016, all of which relate to the United States’ immigration crisis. [In the month of September alone, a Turkish immigrant allegedly shot and killed five people in a Washington State mall an Afghan immigrant allegedly planted bombs in New York and New Jersey injuring roughly 30 innocent people a Somali immigrant allegedly stabbed nine people at a Minnesota mall a   illegal alien with a prior DUI conviction allegedly murdered a Kansas sheriff’s deputy an illegal alien and convicted child rapist allegedly shot two California corrections officers an illegal alien with a prior drug arrest, who had been a recipient of Obama’s executive amnesty, allegedly engaged in reckless driving killing a    girl a   deported illegal alien allegedly killed two people on what was described as a crime "rampage" and a Mexican immigrant and Arizona pastor was arrested after it was revealed that he had allegedly molested children for years, many of whom are believed to belong to his church, and for impregnating one of his victims when she was 13 years old.  At the same time, a Department of Homeland Security audit revealed that over 1, 800 foreign nationals who were slated to be deported were instead awarded U. S. citizenship. The below list is by no means exhaustive —  it is simply intended to highlight the scope and scale of the nation’s immigration crisis, which frequently goes unreported or dismissed by establishment media. While the media may report some of these crimes (such as the extensive coverage given to the New York City bombing or the Minnesota mall stabber) their reporting is almost always absent any immigration context. In addition to the crimes committed by people in the country illegally, this list includes crimes attached to individuals whom our government voluntarily chose to admit, or even decided to reward with U. S. citizenship. Got news tips? Email reporters Julia Hahn (jhahn@breitbart. com) and Katie McHugh (kmchugh@breitbart. com). Border Patrol agents arrested Francisco Javier   a Mexican national and   sex offender registered with the Texas Department of Public Safety. In 2008, Cruz was reportedly convicted of indecency with an 11   girl by sexual contact. The illegal alien had been previously deported on October 1, 2010 and has now been charged with illegal  . Juan Navarro Rios, 43, a   previously deported illegal alien was arrested for what was described as a crime "rampage. " CBS described Rios as "a murderer, carjacker and kidnapper whose reign of terror spanned at least from the city of Dallas to just north of Austin. " During his "reign of terror," Rios allegedly shot to death a    man in his vehicle on the shoulder of Texas State Highway Spur 408, he then "opened fire on at least two other vehicles. " Later that evening, Rios allegedly drove up next to Welton Betts, 44, as he was pumping gas at a Texaco gas station. He allegedly shot and killed Betts, forced Betts’ wife out of the car and stole the vehicle. Betts, a black American who had fallen in love and married his high school sweetheart and raised a family with her, has been described as "a typical Texan: he loved God, his family, hard work, the Cowboys, and his pickup truck. " Reports note that Rios also allegedly "broke into a home, took the keys to a Lexus, and drove it to Georgetown, Texas, where it was found abandoned. He is also believed to have kidnapped a man at gunpoint Monday morning and then trying to force him to withdraw money from an ATM. Rios set fire to his sister’s apartment in Georgetown, broke through a wall into a neighbor’s apartment, and tried to flee before being captured. He had a gun nearby. " According to reports, Rios had multiple criminal charges in Williamson County, including felony possession of a controlled substance and burglary of a vehicle. ABC’s WFAA reports that Rios "had so many aliases —  at least eight by last count —  that police aren’t even sure of his real name  …     Records also revealed that he had crossed the U. S.  border at least 35 times, using a passport with a fake name. " Reports note that the illegal criminal alien was   in his Hispanic community. "In a largely   neighborhood in southern Dallas, everybody knew Juan Navarro Rios as ‘flaco’ [Spanish for ‘skinny’].

According to reports, the child victims involved were "considerably younger than the    age limit sentencing guidelines involving adults charged with sex crimes against children. "    Arcan Cetin, a Turkish immigrant, allegedly shot and killed four women and one man at a Washington State mall. It was originally reported Cetin was in the country as a lawful permanent resident, but not a U. S. citizen. However, after documentation surfaced showing he had registered to vote in 2014 and had in fact voted in three elections, new reports now indicate Cetin is a naturalized U. S. citizen. On Twitter, Cetin indicated that he had planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. Cecil Burrows, 23, a known gang member originally from the slums of Mumbai, has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in the 2012 gang rape of a   teenage girl. Burrows decided to record the gang rape on video. Burrows came to the U. S. when he was 12 years old and promptly joined a gang. Even still, the government rewarded him with lawful permanent resident status. The 2012 gang rape was not Burrows’ first   with the law. In 2011, he was charged with theft, but a judge was apparently lenient with him and reportedly spared him jail time, allowing him to go back on the streets and eventually take part in a gang rape the following year. Reports note that the gang rape might never have come to light if one of Burrows’ fellow gang members hadn’t bragged about the rape to his   and showed him the "funny" video recording of the rape, which he had saved on his cellphone. The Washington Post reports that on the   audio recording of the rape, Burrows can be heard "like a coach" giving instructions to the men on how to rape the girl.

"As the recording continues, Burrows could be heard giving instructions, at one point asking, ‘Who’s next? ’" During a   operation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 47 illegal aliens from the Washington D.

During the attempted burglary, Rivera had broken into the backyard but was met with barking by a small puppy. Surveillance cameras show Rivera subsequently "cornered the   mix, lifted the dog over his head and slammed it down with all his strength on the concrete slab twice. " River is now reportedly "facing felony counts of animal cruelty charges and attempted burglary charges. " Rivera is reportedly on an immigration hold. An audit of the Department of Homeland Security released   revealed that 1, 811 foreign nationals, who were supposed to be deported, were instead given U. S. citizenship.

The Daily Caller reports that "  was previously arrested for DUI in California in 2001 and a traffic violation in Overland Park, Kansas in 2013. " He was cited for driving without a license and paid a $121 fine after pleading guilty. The Daily Caller writes: "ICE has said they were not notified of either of those arrests. Overland Park is located in Johnson County, which is a ‘sanctuary county’ [  …    ] 41 Action News reported that the Overland park police department that arrested him in 2013 said didn’t notify ICE because, ‘it could be considered profiling because a lot of people of all races are arrested without a proper ID. ’" The Kansas City Star reports that Deputy Collins "would have celebrated his 21st anniversary with the department next month. " He is survived by his wife and two daughters.

ABC15 reports that, allegedly, "Morales had been molesting children for years" and had "impregnated one of the victims when she was 13 years of age.

"One victim accused Morales of molesting her from ages seven to 12, she said she was molested once while in a pool as she was swimming with the man," ABC15 writes.

Duarte pled guilty to one count of child molestation and one count of attempted sexual abuse of a minor. Nogales International reports: "Despite the nature of the charges against him and the fact that he is a citizen of another county, Andrade was never arrested or ordered to post bond.

" When police apprehended   he reportedly told them, "If I hadn’t been drunk this morning, you guys would never have caught me. " Illegal alien and Salvadoran national, Elias Josael Jimenes Avardo, 21, was charged with murder of a    woman, Ranarda Williams, in Northwest Baltimore.
