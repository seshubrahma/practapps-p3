.@JoeNBC on @realDonaldTrump: The guy looks like he’s in the catbird seat https:  .  Thursday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," host Joe Scarborough reacted to an interview hosted by Fox New Channel’s Bill O’Reilly on the network’s "The O’Reilly Factor" a night earlier with Republican presidential   Donald Trump.  Scarborough mocked O’Reilly, who begged Trump to reconsider his decision not to appear in the network’s GOP presidential debate in Des Moines, IA scheduled for later tonight. "First of all, I think we prove on this show that we don’t beg," Scarborough said. "I do remember when we got disconnected from Donald, it was dead silent on the set here and Nicolle [Wallace] said, ‘I am sweating from every pore.’ She was nervous. Everybody was nervous. But no, I think in my subtle words  —   the subtle words I used yesterday, ‘I’d rather set myself on fire than beg somebody’ to do something. " Scarborough argued that based on O’Reilly’s tack in the interview, it appears Trump has an advantage over Fox News. "Donald Trump  —   the guy looks like he is in the catbird’s seat," he added. "Again, I think Fox has walked into a trap. It actually feeds into every one of his strengths. He now has the most powerful network for Republicans. It’s an indispensable network for Republicans. It now has pretty much its most powerful person begging him to be on the network. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
