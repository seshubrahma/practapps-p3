David Corn writes at Mother Jones about the coming chaos at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. ["We got her. We got her. "  It’s near midnight. Democratic Party delegates are milling about the lobby bar of the Marriott in downtown Philadelphia. And on the big overhead screen, there’s a CNN report on the news of the day: Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( .) the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, had given up the post after leaked emails showed that some DNC officials had discussed how to thwart Bernie Sanders’ campaign. Sanders delegates are cheering wildly. The head of the party apparatus many of them despise is out. It’s a victory for the Sanders revolution. Off to the side, a Florida delegate for Hillary Clinton looks on sadly. "I suppose she had to go," he says.

Lisa Flyte, a Sanders representative on the convention credentials committee, griped that the Clinton campaign "is still taking jabs at us. " Though she noted she believed that a Trump victory would likely be bad news for   and   Americans, she said Clinton has "supported policies that hurt   people here and abroad. " She blasted Clinton for supporting "oligarchs overseas and big energy companies. " She was ticked off that the Clinton campaign "is saying we’re unified without real accommodations.
