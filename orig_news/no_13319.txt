Sunday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends," Byron York of the Washington Examiner said the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has shown an "enormous difference between Republican elitist, based mostly in Washington, and Republican voters on issues. "  York said, "That could be the most fundamental question of this campaign, because what the Trump campaign has shown, even if we were to withdraw today, what the Trump campaign has shown, and to a lesser extent the Cruz campaign, are the enormous difference between Republican elitist, based mostly in Washington, and Republican voters on issues of taxes, on issues of entitlement reform, on immigration, trade, on foreign military. On all of these things Trump has laid out positions that are anathema to many people in sort of the political,   elite world of Washington and he’s winning the race by doing it. " Host Tucker Carlson agreed, saying " It’s unbelievable how totally unaware of who their own voters are in the Republican party turned out. I think it’s also true on the Democratic side. "
