Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. "From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first. " Those were the words of President Trump at his inauguration on Friday, just as rain began falling in the capital. His forceful address offered a strikingly grim view of the United States, repudiated the establishment and alarmed leaders around the world  —   but also energized his supporters at home and abroad. At age 70, Mr. Trump became the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first to have never served either in public office or as a military general. _____ 2.

Among those being scrutinized are Paul Manafort, above, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign and Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative.
