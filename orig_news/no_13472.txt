Snoop Dogg launched into a   tirade against former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in a pair of videos posted to his Instagram page Monday, attacking the governor and action movie star for commuting the sentence of Esteban Nunez, who knifed an unarmed college student to death in 2008, but refused to grant a stay of execution to a Crips gang  . [Nunez was sentenced to 16 years in prison, but Schwarzenegger used his final day in office in 2011 to bring the sentence down to seven years. Nunez, now 27, was released from prison on Sunday after serving less than six years of his sentence.  WATCH (explicit Language warning):  Fuck you Arnold  what a friend. U are 😡😡🐍🐍🕷 A video posted by snoopdogg (@snoopdogg) on Apr 11, 2016 at 10:24pm PDT,  "Arnold Schwarzenegger’s a straight b —  ch. Punk motherf —  ker," the rapper said in the first video. "How the f —  k you gonna let this n —  a out of jail but you gonna kill Tookie Williams, n —  a. ‘Cause homeboy was your friend  …     I can’t stand you. You’re one motherf —  king racist piece of sh —  t. F —  k you Arnold Schwarzenegger. " The rapper appeared to be referring to Stanley "Tookie" Williams, a   of the infamous Crips gang who was put to death by lethal injection in 2005.   Schwarzenegger denied Williams’ request for a stay of execution.  Fuck. You.

"You motherf —  kers really got the game f —  ked up, man. " Schwarzengger’s commutation of Nunez’s sentence was, and still is, massively controversial, as the convicted killer was the son of Fabian Nunez, the politically powerful former California Assembly Speaker who had a close political relationship with the governor. Nunez began serving his original   sentence in June 2010 for the stabbing death of unarmed college student Luis Santos in San Diego, according to the Los Angeles Times. Another man convicted in the stabbing is still serving his lengthy original prison sentence. In 2012, the Santos family sued to have the commutation overturned but it was found legal by a Sacramento judge, who nevertheless called it "repugnant. " "Our son has paid his debt to society," the Nunez family said in a statement on Friday. "He is committed to continuing the work of healing,   and spiritual growth.
