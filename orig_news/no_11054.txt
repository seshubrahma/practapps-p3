Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC, a Super PAC dedicated to opposing Hillary Clinton, is turning up the heat on her following the FBI’s release of the notes on Clinton’s interview about her private email server. [Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC’s communications director Hogan Gidley says the FBI’s documents prove that Clinton is "deceitful and dishonest. "  "This latest FBI report reinforces what Americans already know  —   that Hillary Clinton is a truly deceitful and dishonest person and the manner in which she handled classified material was dangerous, reckless and a clear violation of the law," Gidley said in a press release. "Hillary chooses to blame others for her wrong doing and refuses to take responsibility for her own bad judgment. " Gidley added, "For once, I’m in complete agreement with Senator Bernie Sanders when he so eloquently and correctly pointed out that Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment to be President of the United States. " Like Gidley, who suggested that the notes reveal Clinton’s behavior was "a clear violation of the law," the Republican nominee stated he was in disbelief that she was "able to get away from prosecution. " "Hillary Clinton’s answers to the FBI about her private email server defy belief," Donald Trump stated in response to the FBI’s document release on Friday afternoon. "I was absolutely shocked to see that her answers to the FBI stood in direct contradiction to what she told the American people. After reading these documents, I really don’t understand how she was able to get away from prosecution. "
