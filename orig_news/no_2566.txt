(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. EgyptAir Flight 804, an Airbus A320, veered suddenly en route from Paris to Cairo and crashed into the Mediterranean with 66 people aboard. Egypt’s civil aviation minister acknowledged that the cause might be terrorism. That was in a sharp contrast to Egypt’s reticence last October, when a Russian airliner went down over the Sinai Peninsula, killing all 224 people on board. _____ 2. Our latest New York   News poll shows that, despite Bernie Sanders’s fervent efforts to siphon support from Hillary Clinton, most Democratic voters think she will be able to unite the party. And most Republican voters believe their party leaders should support Donald Trump even if they disagree with him. Both candidates face major resistance from key voting blocs. Mrs. Clinton would win in a   with Mr. Trump, if it were held now, 47 percent to 41 percent. But Mr. Sanders would beat Mr. Trump  . _____ 3. "Unless you suspend the Constitution and instruct the police to behave as if we live in North Korea, it ain’t happening. " That was a former secretary of Homeland Security, speaking of Mr. Trump’s promise to deport 11 million immigrants. Experts who have closely examined some of his pledges warn of astronomical costs and violations of basic rules of science, engineering and law. _____ 4. Federal prosecutors believe they know the secret of at least some of the financial success of William Walters, the high roller considered one of the best sports gamblers in the country: insider trading. They accused him of receiving   from Thomas Davis, the former chairman of the huge milk processor Dean Foods, who was also charged. _____ 5. Care for a little virtual space travel? The Times used data from NASA’s recent flyby of Pluto in a joint project with the Lunar and Planetary Institute and the Universities Space Research Association to build a detailed virtual planetary visit. Download our NYT VR app, and enjoy a pretty amazing show. _____ 6. Morley Safer, the genial fixture on CBS’s "60 Minutes" for more than five decades, died. He was 84 and had retired just last week. As a war correspondent in his youth, he was one of the few U. S. reporters covering Vietnam who broke away from scripted press briefings and brought battles  —   and official contradictions  —   into Americans’ living rooms. _____ 7. As it happens, some Vietnamese are so nervous about Chinese expansionism that they are lobbying for U. S. forces to return to their   base at Cam Ranh Bay. President Obama arrives in Vietnam on Sunday, and a return may be part of talks over a deal to allow the country to buy lethal arms. _____ 8. And a Vietnam veteran, Herbert Donahue, helped inspire   law students to join him in trying to win clemency for U. S. service members convicted of killing Iraqi and Afghan civilians. One of the students said he had come to understand "how confusing things were on the ground in Iraq, how arbitrary the brutality was. " A surge of bombings there over the last week killed more than 200 people. _____ 9. A storied golf club in Scotland was dropped as an official site of the British Open after voting narrowly to continue to exclude women as members. A significant majority of the Muirfield Golf Club’s members wanted to open the doors, but the measure fell 35 votes short of the required   majority. _____ 10. One of our   stories today is about a new trend in weddings. Or rather, in breaking them off. Where jitters were once focused on doubts about one’s partner, young people now appear to be discovering   disquiet about the institution of marriage itself. "A pending marriage brings up issues of personal identity," explained a psychotherapist with a premarital coaching practice. _____ 11. Finally, good news for California. A relatively wet winter and a year of successful conservation has eased the   state’s water crisis. So as of June 1, the most drastic limitations on urban water use will be suspended. "We are still in a drought, but we are no longer in        drought," the head of the state water board said. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
