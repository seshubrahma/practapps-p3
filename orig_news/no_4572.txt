"The Trump Administration is committed to energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans and maximize the use of American resources, freeing us from dependence on foreign oil," the page reads. The page addresses finding economically viable energy solutions that are mindful of the environment: [O]ur need for energy must go    with responsible stewardship of the environment.
