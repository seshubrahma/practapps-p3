’  ’ "   Sitting at a desk at the Environmental Protection Agency Tuesday,   President Donald Trump signed an  that attacks the heart of former President   Barack Obama’s climate legacy:  " ’  ’ ’  ’ "   Trump can’t simply scrap a federal regulation like the Clean   Power Plan with a stroke of his pen. Instead, he has   ordered his EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, to begin the process of   doing away with it. " ’  ’ ’’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   "You know, our nation can’t run on pixie dust and hope," said   Ryan Zinke, the Secretary of the Interior, "And the last eight   years showed us that." ’ ’   Vice President Mike Pence said that West Virginia had lost over a   third of its coal mining jobs, with 130 plants closing in recent   years ’ ’   "Those days are over, because the war on coal is over," Pence   said. ’ ’   Trump echoed the statement. ’ ’   "I made them this promise: We will put our miners back to work,"   he said, to applause from the crowd, which included group of   coal miners who had been brought up on stage. ’ "   Many analysts disagree with the claim that deregulating coal will   do much to  given the rise   in automation and the availability of cheap natural gas. Robert   Murray, founder and chief executive of Murray Energy  —   America’s   largest privately held coal company  —   has said that . Murray was in   the front row of the audience at the EPA for the signing. " "   The President’s order also targets fossil fuel rules, lifting a   moratorium on new coal mining leases on federal land, beginning   to relax limits on new coal power plant construction, and rolling   back rules designed to limit methane emissions in oil and gas   extraction. (Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, though less   common than carbon dioxide.) " ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’Sitting at a desk at the Environmental. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
