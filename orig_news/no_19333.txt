’  ’ ’   Eric Trump told a  on Thursday that former Ku Klux Klan   grand wizard and Louisiana Senate candidate "does deserve a   bullet." ’ ’   Trump’’s comments, made on 630 KHOW and later  were made after the host Ross Kaminsky   said Duke "desperately deserves a bullet in the head" and   suggested that Democrats are unfairly drawing connections   between Duke and Donald Trump’’s campaign. ’ ’   "Ross, it’’s disgusting and by the way, if I said exactly what you   said, I’’d get killed for it, but I think I’’ll say it anyway: The   guy does deserve a bullet. I mean, these aren’’t good people.   These are horrible people," Trump said. ’ ’   He then pivoted back to his father’’s presidential campaign:   "I commend my father. My father’’s the first Republican who’’s gone   out and said, ’’Listen, what’’s happened to the     community is horrible, and I’’m going to take care of it." ’ ’   Trump’’s comments follow a  in New Orleans on Wednesday, in which he   got into a shouting match with his opponents. Duke compared   himself to Donald Trump, repeated his support for the Republican   nominee, and said Hillary Clinton "should be getting the electric   chair." ’ "   Donald Trump has disavowed Duke’s support and denounced  by the KKK’s newspaper.
