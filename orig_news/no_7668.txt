Tuesday on ABC’s "The View," Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) attacked presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a "demagogue" and a "bigot. "  When asked if it is fair game to go after Hillary Clinton for her husband former President Bill Clinton’s sexual indiscretions, Sanders said, "No, I don’t think it is. And I have never gone anywhere near that. Look, Donald Trump is a demagogue. He is a bigot, and he has nothing to say about the important issues facing our country. The fact that you have a candidate for president of the United States of America in 2016 who scapegoats and insults Mexicans and Latinos and Muslims and women and veterans and   this is not somebody who should be president of the United States. But that’s what Trump has done. This is what Trump has done throughout his entire campaign. He’s very good at insulting people, at attacking people, but he has nothing to say about the future of this country. " He added, "If I do not win the nomination, I’m going to fight as hard as I can to win it because I believe, as I said a moment ago, I am a stronger candidate against Trump than Secretary Clinton is. But I will do everything that I can to make certain that Donald Trump is not elected president of the United States. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
