In an apparent sign that Senator Elizabeth Warren will not be named Hillary Clinton’s running mate, Ms. Warren was invited by Mrs. Clinton’s campaign on Tuesday to deliver a   address on the first night of the Democratic convention this month  —   a marquee speaking slot but one that is earlier than   picks typically appear. Such nominees usually speak later in the convention week to build anticipation for the top of the ticket. Two Democrats briefed on the invitation to Mrs. Warren, however, cautioned that Mrs. Clinton had not yet made a decision about a running mate and that asking Ms. Warren to take the stage on the first night did not preclude her from being tapped as the   nominee. Ms. Warren and other individuals who received invitations on Tuesday to address the Philadelphia convention were told that their speaking times were subject to change depending on who was selected for vice president, according to the two Democrats, one with ties to Mrs. Clinton and the other to Ms. Warren, who both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss convention planning. But even Ms. Warren’s allies are now increasingly skeptical that she will join the ticket as the famously cautious Mrs. Clinton enjoys a steady lead in the polls over Donald J. Trump and is eyeing Democrats who are less dynamic than Ms. Warren but would not overshadow her on the campaign trail or in the White House. Mrs. Clinton’s meetings with the remaining   candidates are continuing: She has met with or is expected to meet soon with Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey Representative Xavier Becerra of California Julian Castro and Tom Perez, who both serve in President Obama’s cabinet and James G. Stavridis, a retired   Navy admiral, at her Washington home. She will also campaign on Thursday alongside another potential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, in his home state. Ms. Warren had initially handed over paperwork and met with the Washington lawyer overseeing Mrs. Clinton’s   search. And at a   joint rally in Cincinnati last month that fueled speculation about an   ticket, Ms. Warren drew loud applause for a stinging indictment of Mr. Trump as "a small, insecure money grubber. " But any political necessity of putting Ms. Warren on the ticket to placate liberals diminished after Senator Bernie Sanders pledged to support Mrs. Clinton, and the progressive voters who flocked to his candidacy continued to coalesce around Mrs. Clinton. Some 63 percent of people who voted for Mr. Sanders during the Democratic primaries said they would vote for Mrs. Clinton in the fall, according to a CBS News poll conducted last month.
