Fox News Channel welcomed in 2016 with GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, who made quite a declaration to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.  Trump told the "  New Year" hosts Kimberly Guilfoyle and Eric Bolling he thinks he will be Clinton’s "worst nightmare. " "I think I’ll be her worst nightmare but we’ll find out," Trump said. "Look, she won’t do the job. We’re going to do the job and we’ll do some really special things. We have to really work to make our country great again and we’re going to do that. We’re going to do that. We’re do it tirelessly and we’re have a lot of fun doing it and everybody will do it together. So I look forward to it. If it is Hillary Clinton in the race, I look forward to going against her. " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
