It has now been 270 days since Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton held a press conference. [Clinton emerged from a series of private fundraisers in the Hamptons to make a rare public appearance today. She spoke for less than an hour to the American Legion National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio and refused to take any unscripted questions.  Clinton has avoided any public event not carefully controlled by her campaign. Her last public appearance was six days ago and #HidingHillary isn’t scheduled to appear in public again until September 7th in New York City. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver a major immigration policy speech in Phoenix, Arizona this evening with his runningmate Governor Mike Pence. The Trump campaign grabbed headlines with a late announcement that Trump would travel to Mexico to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto before the speech in Phoenix. Trump has repeatedly stated that as President he would make Mexico pay for a border wall. I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow.  —   Donald J.
