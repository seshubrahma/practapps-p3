Holmes (@tjholmes) April 27, 2016,  4:51: Fiorina says she is proud of the enemies Cruz has made because you ruffle feathers when you challenge the establishment. 4:49: In an   election cycle, Tweets like this will remind voters that Fiorina is as typical of a politician as they come: Love my alma mater, but rooting for a Hawkeyes win today. #RoseBowl,  —   Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) January 1, 2016,  4:47: Fiorina, never seen as a stalwart conservative, says this is a fight for the "soul of the party"and the future of the nation.

He mentions that Fiorina has known tragedy and mentions that she recovered from breast cancer and lost a stepdaughter because of drug addiction. He says you find your character and faith when you are facing the abyss. He says Fiorina isn’t intimidated by bullies because she has faced challenges a lot worse than someone bellowing and making fun of her face. He says his girls love Fiorina and both regularly text her. 4:30: Cruz says Carly respects the Bill of Rights and understands the threats facing America.

He says Indiana and America want to unite behind a positive and   campaign based on real policy solutions. He says the American people deserve a real choice in November, "a choice and not an echo. " Cruz says one of the "most solemn" choices a candidate makes is selecting a running mate. He says you are telling the American people that "this is an individual you can trust to lead this country no matter what might happen. " He says any responsible candidate for president will have spent much time assessing candidates, thinking through the pros and cons, praying about it, and examine the potential candidates. He says the characteristics you look for in a vice president are the same ones  you look for in a president. He cites knowledge, judgment, and character. 4:08: Cruz about to make Fiorina announcement in Indiana: Still some empty chairs as @tedcruz is scheduled to announce @CarlyFiorina as his vp pick in Indianapolis. pic. twitter.   —   Terrence Dopp (@tdopp) April 27, 2016,  3:55: Report: At least 35 of the 54 unbound delegates in PA will back Trump. 3:51: On CNN, Bobby Plump, the   Jimmy Chitwood who inspired the Hoosiers movies, says he has never ever heard of a basketball hoop referred to as a "ring.

" He says the publicity is going to be "great" for Trump across the state. "In Indiana, when you talk about basketball, you’re going to get everybody involved in it," he says. 3:45: Cruz claims Trump’s foreign policy speech "is the most dramatic evidence thus far that Donald Trump fails the presidential test" and says Trump is "now the foreign policy candidate of the Washington lobbyists.

First, many of Cruz’s "New York values" criticisms of Trump can be leveled at Fiorina. So, Cruz can’t effectively criticize Trump for not having core conservative values after picking Fiorina, whose one note candidacy didn’t resonate because conservative grassroots voters have never trusted her as one of them. Second, should Cruz somehow win the nomination, Democrats would eviscerate her as the female Mitt Romney. The Cruz campaign will be on the defensive throughout the election cycle and pieces of Fiorina’s business record will be like batting practice pitches that Hillary Clinton will knock out of the park on a daily basis in an election cycle in which Americans are revolting against political and Wall Street fat cats who put their interests above the country’s and their workers. In a nutshell, Fiorina’s record at Hewlett Packard will neutralize all of Clinton’s vulnerabilities re: establishment cronyism. 3:05: Trump agrees with Fiorina that Cruz is a "typical political" who will say whatever it takes to get elected. Agreed! pic. twitter.   —   Donald J.

" Here’s a statement from Trump on the   ticket: pic. twitter.   —   Jose A. DelReal (@jdelreal) April 27, 2016,  2:50: In an act of desperation, Ted Cruz will announce Carly Fiorina will be his running mate. The timing is horrible (if he were going to make such an announcement, he should have done it weeks ago) because Cruz now seems like a team who has been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs getting fitted for championship rings it will never get: The ticket, in cards. pic. twitter.   —   Rick Klein (@rickklein) April 27, 2016,  2:45: Give CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, a bonafide foreign policy expert, a lot of credit. He said Trump’s foreign policy speech will resonate with Americans even though the Washington elite will probably hate it.   2:35: Gingrich predicts the shallow Washington elites would mock Trump’s speech. Predictably, many like the Washington Post‘s vacuous Chris Cillizza, who wouldn’t be able to discuss foreign policy matters in depth with experts, do mock him. The mainstream media only want Trump to give more specifics so they and their "experts" can spend weeks tearing apart whatever "specifics" Trump lays out. It’s a game Trump can’t win and he is better off not tipping his hand and giving specifics and instead promising to Americans that all of his foreign policy decisions will put America —  and American workers —  first.   This was a serious foreign policy speech by Trump. It is worth reading and thinking about. It will be ridiculed by Washington elites.  —   Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) April 27, 2016,  Elites have to attack Trump’s foreign policy speech because he is challenging their core values and failures. To them it is dangerous ideas.  —   Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) April 27, 2016,  To say this Trump foreign policy speech is light on specifics is an insult to specifics.  —   Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) April 27, 2016,  "We are getting out of the   business."  —   Donald Trump. No mention of what business we will be getting into.  —   Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) April 27, 2016,
