A sketch during this week’s broadcast of NBC’s "Saturday Night Live" portrayed an election night watch party as some Democrats may have last Tuesday, given Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was a heavy favorite.  The Clinton supporters in the sketch started the night feeling good about Clinton’s chances, but the hope dwindled as the night went on as it became apparent Donald Trump was going to win the presidency. SNL guest host Dave Chappelle and former show cast member Chris Rock each mocked the white Clinton supporters as they complained about Trump winning states. "Get some rest," Rock said. "You’ve got a big day of moping and writing on Facebook tomorrow. " Actor Beck Bennett’s character said, "This is the most shameful thing America has ever done," which made Rock and Chappelle laugh hysterically. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
