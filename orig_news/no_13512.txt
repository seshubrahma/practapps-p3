On Wednesday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s "Special Report," columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s remarks about Russia accessing Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails was "a trap" where "the Clinton campaign ends up admitting that perhaps there really is   if not classified stuff, on the emails which she deleted, which I think would be the grounds for a charge of obstruction. "  Krauthammer said, "I do think there was something about his reference to Russia, which, whether planned or not, is extremely clever. I’m not the first point out that it set a trap that the Clinton campaign fell right into. In that statement that you showed from the Clinton campaign, it said, you know, you’re inviting a foreign power to invade our national security. Now, these are the emails that she deleted because they were supposedly private. These the ones that were supposedly not  . These are ones where she discusses her yoga lessons and wedding planning. So, if that’s what really [is] in the 30, 000 deleted   then there’s no national security to be involved at all. So, the Clinton campaign ends up admitting that perhaps there really is   if not classified stuff, on the emails which she deleted, which I think would be the grounds for a charge of obstruction.
