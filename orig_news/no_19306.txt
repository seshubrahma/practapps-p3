’  ’ ’  ’ ’     The attendees were sitting around a square table formation in     an observation room, where their names were handwritten on     folded pieces of pink, yellow, or blue construction paper at     their seats. It resembled a private party room at a Chuck E.     Cheese’s or a bowling alley, except with adults instead of     children, paper handouts instead of pizza, and a low hum of     existential dread instead of joy and laughter.   ’ ’     "Anybody fall into that category?" Hart asked.   ’ ’     Zero hands went up.   ’ ’     "OK," he continued. "I like one candidate. " ’ ’     No hands.   ’ ’"I don’t like either candidate. "   ’ ’     Every hand went up.   ’ ’     It was a cheery way to kick off a   focus group, which     Hart would later describe to reporters as "unbelievably     negative" and among the worst he’s seen in his   years of     measuring public opinion.   ’ ’     The group Hart selected for this research project, conducted on     behalf of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University     of Pennsylvania, was largely middle class, educated, and       —  the kind of voters whom a generic Republican     candidate, after eight years of a Democratic presidential     administration and in a state that voted for Mitt Romney in     2012, would have already secured by now. Three described themselves as Democrats,     six as Republicans, and three as independents; nine listed     their ideology as "moderate," while three were "somewhat     conservative. " Five considered their political hero to be     Ronald Reagan, while another two —  the younger       in the room —  pointed to George W. Bush. This would have been a        or    room for Republican presidential nominee John     Kasich. Instead it was four reluctant  ; five             —  Supreme Court Trumpers, and     three who may well have mental breakdowns when they enter the     voting booth on Nov. 8.   ’ ’       They will enter the voting booth, though. "I have       to," said Gary Nesbitt, a    moderate Republican       banking consultant and probably the purest undecided of the       group. "Otherwise, I can’t complain. "     ’ ’  ’ ’       In a healthy election year,   undecideds would be in       that position because they’re political moderates still       weighing the pros and cons of each candidate’s policy       positions. Such a dynamic seems like a quaint, unrealistic       piece of historical fiction now, even if it was basically the       dynamic governing elections as recent as Romney versus Barack       Obama. With two wildly unpopular candidates this cycle,       candidates who by nature of their   unpopularity have       run campaigns of personal destruction against their opponent,       it’s natural that these undecideds would frame the decision       as a matter of which contemptible personage they could       tolerate for four years.     ’ ’       None saw any aspect of the election as anywhere near       edifying. Jennifer Meador, a    homemaker, described       the election as "embarrassing for our country," while Katie       Burak, a    financial planner, said she’s seen       nothing but "personal attacks" this year. Donna Ryan, a          retired finance director, said, "It’s       embarrassing all the —  pardon my French —  it’s embarrassing all       the bullshit that’s going on. " Meador added that she has a          son and doesn’t know how to talk to him about       this election: "It’s hard to explain why adults are acting       this way. " The dominant theme of the election, as Nesbitt put       it, was "vote for me because I’m less of a sleazeball. "     ’ ’         With policy considerations seemingly at such a remove from         the national discussion, they saw the election as part of a         broader cultural malaise. Terry Ragsdale, a    IT         worker, saw the country as still unable to grapple with the         negative events that began with  . "Osama did what he         sought to do" —  sending the country into disarray —  "and we’ve         never quite recovered. " Several, including Burak,            welding technician Jon Johnson, and   old         banking analyst Sabrina Tucker, were deeply worried about         Facebook, Twitter, and other social media tearing apart the         social and political fabric of the republic. When Hart         asked whether the next generation would be better off than         the previous, no hands went up.       ’ ’         Though the group had no love for Trump beyond the more         conservative members’ hope that he could preserve their         Supreme Court advantage, they spoke of the "old days"         through a similarly rosy prism. They missed the "innocence"         of a time when negative news didn’t dominate public life.         The clearest analogue to a Trumplike statement came from         Ryan, who described her brother’s experience in Catholic         schools of the "old days," when nuns would slap his hands         for acting out of order. "I’m not defending corporal         punishment," she prefaced, "but there’s something to be         said for getting your hand slapped. "       ’ ’  ’ ’         Ryan was leaning toward voting for Clinton. She wasn’t         happy about it. A moderate, Ryan had wanted to find an         excuse to vote for Trump. "I so much wanted Trump. I so         much wanted a nonpolitician. But I don’t trust him, and         I’ve become afraid of him," she said. "I just don’t think         he knows when to shut up. If he could just [say] ‘I’m a         businessman, I’m not a politician, I’m gonna make American         great again,’ and stop right there, then I would         vote for him. " During Trump’s postconvention meltdown,         though, she would watch as he "just went on and on, and his         face [would get] all red. " The face reminded her of a         "little boy," like her five brothers growing up. "I         remember that face. And that’s when I got scared. And so I         started to listen to Clinton. I don’t love Clinton —  I don’t         trust her. But I think she’s the lesser of two evils. "       ’ ’           The imagery of the   little boy dominated one           "lightning round" section of the group, when members were           asked to fill in the blank on the question of           "[Candidate]’s behavior reminds me of ______. " For Trump,           the answers included several "school boys," a "spoiled           brat," "child having a tantrum," "rich kid," and "George           Brett with the pine tar. "         ’ ’           But the descriptors for Clinton weren’t any better:           "robotic," multiple "liar"s and one "liar liar pants on           fire," "maleficent," "privileged," "too poised,"           "polished politician," and "cool operator. " When Hart           asked what they thought motivated her, "power" and           "ambition" were the dominant responses.         ’ ’           For the   and the pure undecideds who           couldn’t see themselves voting for Trump, the choice came           down to competence. "She knows what she’s doing,"           Ragsdale said, "so I’m going to have to lean that way. "           The   held onto the Supreme Court as their           best excuse.         ’ ’           The last question Hart asked after more than two hours of           questions was who everyone thought would win the           election. It was unanimous for Clinton.         ’ ’  ’ ’           Hart was a   host. He cracked jokes in the           room to ease the tension. When one panelist suggested           that the polls may be off, he mocked offense, saying, "I           beg your pardon. " (Hart   the             Street Journal poll.) He kept a running           banter with a select few participants. Some levity was           necessary in that room.         ’ ’             Afterward, though, he admitted that he too was struck             by the salty, surly, despairing negativity in the room.             He saw Ryan and a couple of other undecideds, who with             any other GOP   would be with the             Republican and against Clinton, as the election in a             nutshell. Even if   may have narrowly             outnumbered   on the panel, that wasn’t a             bad result for a   sample. Ryan "never             came to Hillary; she was forced to Hillary," Hart said,             and voters like her are the reason Clinton is likely to             both win the election and suffer from an extremely             difficult presidency. "She’s got the votes," he added,             "she’s just not going to have the support. "           ’ ’             I was struck by Hart’s cynical take on how Clinton             herself would have viewed a focus group like this,             where not one participant could admit to liking her but             where several said they would reluctantly vote for her.             Hart believed Clinton would have seen this as a             "success": She had achieved the goal of making her             opponent look worse than her to enough people in order             to win the election. Clinton’s the type of person who             can take a task that’s right in front of her, he said,             and execute it, but the broader vision either isn’t             there or is never clearly relayed to the public. "If             the job was to get elected president, she did it," he             said, "or she’s going to do it. " And after that, what?           ’
