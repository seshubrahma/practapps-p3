Monday on ABC’s "The View,"   Joy Behar decried   Donald Trump’s criticism of the CIA for alleging the Russian government had acted to Trump’s benefit to influence the outcome of last month’s presidential election.  Behar suggested Trump step down as   before inauguration for the good of the country. "It’s like they are discrediting the CIA," she said. "His campaign and he, the   of this country is discrediting the organization that basically protects us from foreign invasion, from, you know  —   isn’t it time for him to step down I mean, he has to step down before the inauguration, before they give him the nuclear codes. We are at risk when the president of the United States is fighting with the CIA. That is a terrible thing. "  "Do we have to wait until the hammer and sickle is on the American flag until we stand up to this guy?" she added. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
