During an interview on CNN on Tuesday, Senator Ted Cruz ( ) stated that the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court is a "home run. "  Cruz said, "During the campaign, he promised the American people that he would nominate a principled constitutionalist to replace Justice Scalia, and tonight President Trump honored that commitment.   …     I think Judge Gorsuch is a home run. He has a decade of proven experience on the court of appeals of being faithful to the Constitution, following the law, protecting the Bill of Rights and our fundamental liberties, and I think that record will yield a swift confirmation in the United States Senate. " He added, "Democrats are engaged right now in unprecedented partisan obstruction, but I hope on the Supreme Court they will not engage in that practice.   …     Democrats will not succeed in filibustering Judge Gorsuch. They may try, but they will not succeed. " Cruz also addressed whether or not blocking Gorsuch would be fair turnabout for blocking the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland by saying the two nominations took place under a "fundamentally different" set of circumstances because Garland was appointed during an election year.
