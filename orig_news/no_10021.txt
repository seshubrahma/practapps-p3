GOP frontrunner Donald Trump suggested he could put fellow 2016 GOP presidential candidates Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich in his administration  —   possibly even as vice president on his ticket. ["Yes. I like Marco Rubio. Yeah. I could," Trump told columnist Kirsten Powers about putting Rubio in his administration.  He was asked if Rubio was a potential vice president choice for him. "There are people I have in mind in terms of vice president. I just haven’t told anybody names.   …     I do like Marco. I do like [John] Kasich.   …     I like [Scott] Walker actually in a lot of ways. I hit him very hard.   …     But I’ve always liked him. There are people I like, but I don’t think they like me because I have hit them hard," Trump responded.
