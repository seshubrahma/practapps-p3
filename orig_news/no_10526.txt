On this weekend’s broadcast of "Fox News Sunday," Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has "demolished" the argument he would appoint liberals to the Supreme Court by releasing a list of potential candidates.  Sessions said Trump "wants to establish that his goal for the Supreme Court is a professional, thoughtful jurist who believe in the classical role of a judge as a neutral umpire, not as an advocate for various social policies that they may favor, and I think this was a great decision. " "It’s been well received throughout the country," he added. On Trump’s list of conservative judges, he said, "Certainly has confirmed their belief that he will nominate good judges because these are really fine list, all of them are accomplished, good scholarly backgrounds, proven records. I think that was  —   it did reassure some people that were attacking and saying he would not nominate conservative judges. " He continued, "We heard that a lot. It was part of the themes in the campaign that Donald Trump would nominate liberal judges. I think he has demolished that argument. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
