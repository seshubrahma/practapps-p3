Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. The Obama administration made its stance on transgender rights clear to public schools across the country, sending a letter telling districts to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity. The directive isn’t a law, but the threat of lawsuits or loss of federal aid is implicit. The move came at the end of a week that also saw the Justice Department and North Carolina sue one another over access to public restrooms. _____ 2. Donald Trump dominated campaign news, both in political maneuvering on Capitol Hill and seamier stories  —   like a former butler threatening to lynch President Obama and his contradictory relationships with women. The sheer volume of such reports may be dulling their impact. "He moves so quick and creates outrages so fast, you almost forget what happened," a Republican strategist said. _____ 3. On the Democratic side of the presidential contest, some supporters of Bernie Sanders are working on a proposal that he suspend his campaign after the June 7 California primary, concede to Hillary Clinton and use his popularity to focus his efforts on helping defeat Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Sanders rejected the idea. _____ 4. The leadership struggle in Brazil turned decisive, as the Senate suspended President Dilma Rousseff to try her for fiscal skullduggery. The move could push the country, a bastion of the South American left, farther to the right. _____ 5. Did Russia cheat to be the top   at the 2014 Olympics at Sochi? A former Russian official said he had overseen a vast doping program, years in the making, and that at Sochi, his team was able to access urine samples through a hole in a wall, open supposedly     bottles and replace dozens of athletes’ tainted samples with clean urine. Russia denounced the account. _____ 6. Years of debate within the White House ended in an announcement that, yes, President Obama would visit Hiroshima. In less than two weeks, he will become the first sitting U. S. president to visit the memorial to the victims of the atomic bombs the U. S. dropped on Japan in World War II. The two countries, now allies, still tend to see the other as failing to fully accept its responsibility. _____ 7. Forget the fountain of youth: Scientists are working on a second skin to erase the effects of aging. The invisible film has been successful, in small studies, at making undereye bags vanish and wrinkles disappear, as on the left above. It might also be used to treat eczema, psoriasis and other skin conditions, researchers say. _____ 8. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised federal money to help rebuild the Canadian city of Fort McMurray, which was nearly destroyed by a wildfire. Damage estimates rise into the billions of dollars. Fires have been ravaging vast swaths of boreal forests in northern latitudes around the world, with climate change often a major factor. _____ 9. Time for a bit of greener news: Researchers are restoring Emily Dickinson’s beloved gardens at her home in Amherst, Mass. She died 130 years ago today, and her extensive flower and vegetable fields, along with an orchard and greenhouse, were removed by later owners. She once wrote: "Some keep the Sabbath going to Church  —     I keep it, staying at Home  —     With a Bobolink for a Chorister  —     And an Orchard, for a Dome. " _____ 10. An extraordinary bank heist: For a second time, thieves penetrated the Swift global financial messaging system, apparently targeting a commercial bank in Vietnam. A few months ago, digital robbers got away with $81 million from Bangladesh’s central bank, above. In both cases, the thieves used real network credentials  —   suggesting the possibility of insider accomplices  —   and hid their actions behind malware. _____ 11. Finally, a sweet note. Japan just loves Kit Kat. There are nearly 300 varieties (including Adzuki Bean and Wasabi) and you can find them in   department stores and    specialty shops. And at least for a few weeks last year, a single stick coated with gold leaf was being sold. Have a great week. _____ Karen Workman contributed reporting.
