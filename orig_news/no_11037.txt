TEL AVIV  —   Donald Trump on Thursday condemned "in the strongest possible terms" the terrorist shooting attack that took the lives of four civilians and wounded at least sixteen others, including at least five seriously. [Taking to his Facebook page, Trump slammed the attack as "outrageous," and declared the American public stand "strong with the people of Israel, who have suffered far too long from terrorism. "  "Israel’s security is a matter of paramount importance to me and the American people," he wrote. Trump condemned the "uncivilized" terrorist organizations and Palestinians groups reportedly celebrating the shooting. He recognized the "culture of religious hatred" that he wrote "permeates many Palestinian quarters. " Trump continued: From schools that indoctrinate toddlers to grow up to kill Israelis to the daily menu of hate that spews forth from various "news organizations," change is long overdue in the Palestinian territories. Hamas praised the terror attack and warned it "is the first of many surprises that will be waiting" for Israel during this Ramadan season.  Hamas stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack. The terrorist shooting attack took place in Tel Aviv’s Sarona Market, an upscale food and shopping center in the heart of central Tel Aviv. Sarona is located near one of the busiest intersections in Tel Aviv. It’s around the corner from an entrance to Israel’s Ayalon Highway and about three city blocks from the Israel Defense Forces main headquarters in Tel Aviv.
