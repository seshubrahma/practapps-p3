Donald Trump is looking to November by taking a swipe at President Barack Obama. [During a campaign rally, the GOP frontrunner called Obama "incompetent" for the way he handled the negotiations over whether the Olympics would take place in the U. S.:  Remember when the president flew to Europe to make a pitch. Now, this is the President of the United States. He made a pitch for the Olympics to come to the United States and I think that’s great. I like it. But if you’re the president, you don’t go over there make a pitch and then not win, right? Too big of a position. If you’re the president, you got to know the answer before you go over. Trump said the president should have called to find out whether or not the Olympics would take place in America or not before leaving the country. "So, we have the President of the United States go over to make a pitch for the Olympics and he gets rejected. We didn’t come in first, or second or third. I think we came in fourth. " "When you’re the President of the United States and you want to get the Olympics to come to this country, and you go over there and you don’t know the answer beforehand, you’re incompetent. You’re incompetent," Trump challenged, adding, "Totally incompetent. "
