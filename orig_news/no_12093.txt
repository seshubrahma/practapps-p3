Yuengling employees, working at "America’s oldest brewery," are supporting Donald Trump. ["Our guys are behind your father," Richard "Dick" Yuengling Jr. says. "We need him in there. "  Yuengling gave Eric Trump and a small group  —   including local GOP leaders  —   a tour of the brewery in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. "Eric Trump predicted his father would win Pennsylvania based on a message that resonates with workers like those at Yuengling, a long established business that has been in Schuylkill County since 1829," reports the Reading Eagle. "Because of a great company like Yuengling," Eric Trump stated, "workers can educate their kids and live a prosperous lifestyle. " The Republican nominee’s son said the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as well as too much regulation and high taxes are "destroying" U. S. businesses. "My father’s going to make it a lot easier for business to function," he vowed. "We’re going to do it right here in the U. S. " Thank you to Dick Yuengling for an amazing tour of the oldest brewery in the U. S! @Yuengling_Beer #PottsvillePA #MAGA pic. twitter.   —   Eric Trump (@EricTrump) October 24, 2016,  According to Phillyvoice. com, some beer drinkers took to social media to disavow the company for supporting Trump.
