In case you happened to wonder what billionaire businessman, investor, and NBA owner Mark Cuban thinks of a potential Donald Trump presidency, the Dallas Mavericks owner held court on NBC Sports Radio’s Newy Scruggs Show, and informed all that he would rather go flat broke, and experience all Mavericks fans turn on him and his team, than see Donald Trump in the White House. [Cuban told Scruggs, "When it’s all said and done, I’d rather lose every penny than have Trump as president, because I care more about the future of my family, my children than I do about my pocketbook. And if it means we have to play in empty arenas, I’m down with that.  "Maybe I pick up some fans. Maybe I lose some fans. I don’t know. I’ve heard it from both. I’ve had people say, ‘There’s no way I can support you. I won’t go to another Mavs game.’ And I’ve had people say, ‘You know what? We’re buying Mavs tickets. ’" This represents quite the shift from what Cuban said about Trump in May, when he told NBC he would consider running on Trump’s ticket if the Republican nominee asked him to. Of course, in the same interview, he also said he would consider running on Hillary’s ticket. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn
