Sunday on CNN’s "State of the Union," the former George W. Bush  Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said he was "afraid" of what Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would do to the country if elected president.  Gutierrez said, "I have one resume here for Donald Trump.  I have one resume here for Hillary Clinton.  And I have chosen this resume.  I think this person, Hillary Clinton, is the best for the country  …    I am not thinking about a Republican.  I am thinking about a U. S. citizen.  I think, at some point, you have to put the party aside and say, what’s best for the country?  I don’t want to live in a society that I think Donald Trump will create. " He added, "One option is to not vote. That’s an option I had but I think that’s letting ourselves off the hook. I actually think that Hillary Clinton has the experience. She has been around. She knows how the system works. I think she would make a darned good president. I would have preferred Jeb Bush, but I think Hillary is a great choice. I am afraid of what Donald Trump would do to this country. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
