Kerry Healey, Romney’s most prominent ally. "If only we could have had more time," said David French, a Tennessee lawyer and Kingston classmate at Harvard Law School who spearheaded the effort.

Army Reserves, and I had started Evangelicals for Mitt the year before [2006] and  —   through a series of coincidences and opportunities  —   I ended up helping Ann Romney on a writing project. In my normal life, I was a    mother of two, so life consisted of car lines, lunchboxes, and afternoon volleyball games. But during the 2008 presidential campaign, I spent time with Mitt and Ann, rode on their campaign bus, heard dozens of speeches, and saw the machinery of a modern presidential campaign from the inside.   …     I headed out west, where I stayed with Mitt, Ann, Ann’s brother Rod, and his wife Cindy in the Romneys’ home. They even spent a day teaching this southerner how to ski at Deer Valley. Nancy French said writing the   work helped her get through her husband’s deployment to Iraq at the same time.
