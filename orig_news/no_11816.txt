Last last week, Blaze founder Glenn Beck fell for a phony,   tweet that had Donald Trump bragging about voting for Barack Obama in 2008.  Beck then spread this misinformation through his own Twitter account and on Fox News’s "O’Reilly Factor. " Once he realized he had been duped, using his Facebook account, Beck wrote a gracious, unreserved apology to Trump and set the record straight.  All good. We all make mistakes. There but by the grace of God go I. Rather than leave it at that, reminiscent of Dan Rather’s   RatherGate scandal, Beck has since launched a bizarre crusade to prove his earlier claim was fake but accurate. Although the record is clear on Trump’s support for John McCain in 2008 (public endorsement, fundraising) Beck followed up his apology early the next morning with a Facebook diatribe that he claims makes the case that Trump voted for Obama in 2008. Two days later, at GlennBeck. com, Beck turned his   into an infographic mocking Trump and again making the debunked case that Trump voted for Obama in 2008. Via Twitter, Trump responded Thursday morning:  —   Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted. Glenn is a failing, crying, lost soul!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 21, 2016,   —     Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
