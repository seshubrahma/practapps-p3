Conservative columnist and bestselling author Ann Coulter tweeted her take on Kathy Griffin’s gruesome   video posing with a   bloody severed head of the President of the United States Tuesday. [Coulter poked fun at Griffin, who has based much of her public image on being an irreverent   "gay icon," described as such by the likes of Gawker and TMZ. Coulter found the gory video an odd choice for Griffin, given its similarity to images popularized by violent Islamists like ISIS, who not only post pictures of themselves with the severed heads of allegedly gay men, but have been known to throw gay men from buildings to their deaths in the name of Sharia Law.

Coulter retweeted, for example, Sen. Al Franken ( )’s decision to stand by Griffin after she issued a video apology Tuesday night saying, "I beg for your forgiveness. I went too far. I made a mistake. And I was wrong. "
