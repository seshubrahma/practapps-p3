Thursday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," Rep. Mark Sanford ( ) weighed in on Wednesday’s shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, VA that resulted in Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) in critical condition at a hospital in Washington, DC.  Sanford said we were "at an inflection point" and we needed to return to civility, or wind up in a "very, very bad spot. " "Indeed, we’re at an inflection point," Sanford said. "There are forces at play I’ve never seen before in roughly the 20 years I’ve been involved in politics. Joe and I came in together way back when. And it is indeed different. I think we have to watch out as a society because if we don’t watch out, civility is indeed a part of civilized government and an open political system. And if you let these forces play out, I think we end up at a very, very bad spot. I think what happened yesterday was symptomatic of it. " He went on to blame President Donald Trump in part for the toxic climate that led to this shooting. "[I] would argue that the president is at least in partially  —   not in any way totally  —   but partially to blame for demons that have been unleashed, whether it is what I saw at a senior center back home and people saying, ‘    and  ’ to each other at a senior center, a retirement center and see each other play croquet the next day, or with what happened  —   not with what happened yesterday, but the fact that you know, you’ve got the top guy saying, ‘Well, I wish I could hit you in the face. And if not, why don’t you and I’ll pay your legal fees.’ That’s bizarre  —   we ought to call it as such. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
