’Conservative radio host Sean Hannity and Sen. Ted Cruz had a testy    on the host’’s Tuesday show, with Hannity telling the Texas senator at one point that he was "getting sick of" Cruz dodging "legitimate questions. "’ ’The interview got off to a tense start. Hannity suggested that Americans were wondering about what role delegates play in the process of choosing a nominee, with talk of a contested Republican convention heating up.’ ’Cruz sharply disputed this notion.’ ’"Sean, with all respect, that’’s not what people are concerned about," Cruz said. "I’’m campaigning every day. People are concerned about bringing jobs back to America. People are concerned about raising wages. People are concerned about getting the federal government off the backs of small businesses, and people are concerned about beating Hillary" Clinton.’ ’Cruz said that the media "loves to obsess" about the process of choosing a Republican nominee for president.

Every time I have you on the air, and I ask a legitimate question, you try to throw this in my face. I’’m getting sick of it. I’’ve had you on more than any other candidate on radio and TV. So if I ask you, senator, a legitimate question to explain to the audience, why don’’t you just answer it? "’ ’Cruz asked if he could answer Hannity’’s question "without being interrupted. "’ ’"Go ahead," Hannity responded.’ ’Cruz explained his view on the delegate process at length:’ ’Cruz said later that he "couldn’’t help" that the Trump campaign "does not seem capable of running a lemonade stand.
