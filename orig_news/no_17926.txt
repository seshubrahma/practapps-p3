’  ’ ’     WASHINGTON (AP)  —   The Trump administration has lifted federal     guidelines that said  students should     be allowed to use public school bathrooms and locker rooms     matching their chosen gender identity.   ’ ’     The Wednesday decision is a reversal of an   directive     issued in May. It will now be up to states and school districts     to interpret whether federal sex discrimination law applies to     gender identity.   ’ ’     A letter sent to schools nationwide Wednesday by the Justice     and Education departments says the earlier directive caused     confusion and lawsuits over how it should be applied. The new     letter says the guidance is lifted, but       safeguards will not be affected.   ’ ’     Although the Obama guidance was not legally binding,      rights advocates say it was necessary     to protect students from discrimination. Opponents argued it     was federal overreach.   ’ ’WASHINGTON (AP)  —   The Trump. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
