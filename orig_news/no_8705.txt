While speaking to voters in Marion, Indiana, on May 2, Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz said Donald Trump once said he hates guns. [Cruz said, "Do you know that Donald Trump supported Bill Clinton’s national ban on some of the most popular firearms in America? And that is a fact. " He added, "You can go read his book where he said [he agreed] with Bill Clinton. In fact, he said, ‘I hate guns.’ That is a quote from Donald Trump. "  Cruz went on to say: I’ll tell you this sir: If Donald Trump ever becomes president, he has said on the Supreme Court, he’s going to cut a deal with Chuck Schumer. He said that two debates ago, which means he’s going to put a liberal on the Supreme Court. He’s going to take away your Second Amendment rights.  Breitbart News previously reported that Donald Trump is a concealed carry permit holder and a Life Member of the NRA.  He responded to last year’s terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino by bemoaning laws that keep innocent people unarmed. During the January 10, 2016, airing of Meet the Press, Trump said: If in Paris or if in California recently, where the fourteen people were killed and probably others to follow —  in terms of that group because you have some people who are very, very badly wounded —  if in Paris they had guns or if in California [they had guns,] on the other side, where the bullets go both ways, not just in one direction. You wouldn’t have had the kind of carnage that you had. Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins. Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart. com.
