 (CNN) This probably wasn’t the wall Donald Trump had in mind. On Tuesday, the same day Trump was officially nominated as the Republican Party’s presidential candidate, a wall sprung up around his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. The tiny wall, complete with barbed wire and "Keep Out" signs, was constructed by popular Los Angeles street artist Plastic Jesus.  The artist posted a photo of it to Instagram and wrote: "Hollywood   on the famous walk of fame were confronted with an unusual edition to Trump’s Famous Star. Someone had built a 6″ tall grey concrete wall around it. Complete with ’Keep out’ signs and topped with razor wire. The unofficial addition to the iconic star appeared early Tuesday afternoon, to the amusement of onlookers." The wall alludes to one of Trump’s most controversial proposals    the erection of a wall along the US border with Mexico in order to halt the flow of illegal immigrants.    Plastic Jesus is known for his provocative work, such as his parking signs that read, "No Trump Anytime" and "No Kardashian Anytime," as well as a   Oscar Statue.
