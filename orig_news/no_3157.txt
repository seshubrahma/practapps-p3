  Donald Trump denounced some of the unsubstantiated rumors published by left wing blogs about Trump receiving "golden showers" from prostitutes while he was in Russia. ["Does anyone really believe that story?" Trump asked incredulously during his press conference at Trump Tower, after he was asked about his behavior in Russia.  "I’m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me," he added. Trump asserted that as a high profile person, he was "extremely careful" about his activity in hotel rooms and was extremely suspicious about hidden cameras. "I’m surrounded by people and I always tell them anywhere, but I always tell them, if I’m leaving this country, be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you’re going to probably have cameras," he said.
