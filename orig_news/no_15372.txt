New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a longtime critic of his fellow Empire State resident, tells Erin Burnett he’s planning a lawsuit should the legislation be signed into law. "If they pass the bill in the form the House passed it, it is unconstitutional," he said on Friday’s edition CNN’s "Erin Burnett OutFront."

Health care, meanwhile, is hardly Schneiderman’s only concern with the president. He also takes issue with Donald Trump’s failure to release his tax returns, a sign, he feels, of the man’s dangerous overall lack of transparency. "The failure to divest and failure to disclose is going to be a problem for this president as long as he keeps this up. .. sooner or later this is going to come to a head." On Thursday the House passed the health care bill by a count of  . It now heads to the Senate where a challenge is expected.
