Wednesday on his syndicated radio show, conservative talker Sean Hannity criticized several   Republicans for how they have treated their party’s nominee Donald Trump.  According to Hannity, if Trump loses in November, House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) will be to blame for the loss because they have spent more time criticizing Trump than President Barack Obama. "If in 96 days Trump loses this election, I am pointing the finger directly at people like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and John McCain and John Kasich and Ted Cruz if he won’t endorse  —   and Jeb Bush and everybody else that made promises they’re not keeping," Hannity said. "And because I have watched and witnessed to the point of incredible frustration  —   I have watched these Republicans be more harsh towards Donald Trump than they’ve ever been in standing up to Barack Obama and his radical agenda that had doubled the debt, that has resulted in a   low in home ownership in this country, the percentage of homes that are owned by Americans, the lowest labor participation rate since the 70s and that has led to millions and millions of Americans in poverty and on food stamps and out of the labor force. " "They did nothing, nothing  —   all these phony votes to repeal and replace ObamaCare, show votes so they can go back and keep their power and get reelected," he added. "Sorry, you created Donald Trump, all of you because of your ineffectiveness, because of your weakness, your spinelessness, your lack of vision, your inability to fight Obama. Your fear of being blamed for a government shutdown and I’m getting a little sick and tired of all of you. Honestly I am tempted to just say I don’t support any of you people ever. You know what, Paul Ryan wants to play this game  —   I haven’t made up my mind either. He’s running against a guy in the primary. I haven’t made up mind who I’m going to support.
