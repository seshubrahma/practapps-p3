Actor Kevin Spacey, who plays President Frank Underwood on House of Cards, offered his opinion of the 2016 presidential race while he attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying Donald Trump’s campaign reminds him of George Wallace’s independent campaign in 1968. [Spacey commented, "I mean, Frank Underwood would look at this particular year and find it as amusing as I do. At the end of the day, the United States has time and again  —   despite sometimes when we think there’s some crazy shit going down  —   we generally get it right eventually. " He compared Trump’s campaign to Wallace’s, saying, "It’s exactly the same campaign. I mean, exactly the same. "  Spacey has made his dislike of Trump public before. Last September, when CNN’s Dana Bash asked him how Underwood would beat Donald Trump in the 2016 election, Spacey replied, "He would kill Donald Trump. That’s number one. Trump would never make it to election day. Done. Over. " Spacey supports Barack Obama —  in July 2013, he gushed, "President Obama will go down as having passed some of the most historic bills in the history of this country. That despite constant   opposition from the Republicans. A lot of people don’t realize how much he’s done in the most difficult circumstances. "
