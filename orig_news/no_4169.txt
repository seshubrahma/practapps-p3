Despite President Donald Trump’s promise to stop companies from outsourcing production to Mexico by imposing a significant border tax on goods sold in America, some businesses ignore this threat. [Following his election in November, the Trump administration assembled a group of 28 business and labor leaders to advise on "on how best to promote job growth and get Americans back to work again," as well as launching a Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.   The Wall Street Journal published a report on Wednesday on some of the companies planning to outsource production. Here is what they found: Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016,  Despite these apparent failures to persuade companies to remain in America, Trump has had some significant successes in ensuring the continuation, or even creation, of jobs in America. As well as assurances from Ford and General Motors to expand production, companies such as Apple, Intel and Amazon have all told the administration they will continue to invest in America. Since Donald Trump’s election in November, Department of Labor figures show the economy has gained 227, 00 jobs, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has eclipsed 20, 000.
