When the sun rises over Abu Simbel in Egypt this morning, rays of light will reach a temple’s dark inner sanctum and shine on statues of gods and of Pharaoh Ramses II, who commissioned the temple’s construction. That phenomenon, which must have struck the pharaoh’s subjects with awe, occurs only twice each year. According to legend, the temple was designed that way to honor the days of the ancient ruler’s coronation and his birthday with sunlight. But if the legend’s true, then the light has been arriving a day late for several decades. In the 1960s, the    temple was moved inland to save it from rising water levels caused by the Aswan Dam. More than a thousand blocks of stone were meticulously cut and transported to its current location. "We didn’t lose a single baboon," an engineer working on the project told The Times then. He was referring to the scores of carved baboons at the temple’s entrance, which are shown barking at the rising sun. The move pushed back, by a day, the arrival of sunlight to the inner sanctum. It now happens on Feb. 22 and Oct. 22. The mummy of Ramses II has also narrowly avoided obliteration in recent decades. In 1974, it was flown to Paris where scientists attempted to slow its deterioration. Egypt issued the mummy a passport on that occasion, its profession listed as: "King (deceased).
