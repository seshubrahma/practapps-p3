Donald Trump said he’s done being a nice guy and is "taking the gloves off" for the general election. ["I’m running against a crooked person," Trump told an   crowd that gathered to see him in Colorado Springs, Colorado Friday afternoon. He also drew more than 6, 000 people during his evening campaign rally in Denver a few hours later.  So @TheNewsan says doors shut at #TrumpInDenver Capacity is 6, 500, accd @DenverFireDept Certainly a big crowd.  —   Brandon Johansson (@SentinelBrandon) July 30, 2016,  Trump added that Hillary Clinton is "a dishonest person" and blasted her for her "average" speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night. "We’re running against a person who was just accused of being negligent  …    and lying. How do you lie to the FBI?" the billionaire blasted, referencing the FBI investigation into Clinton’s use of a private, insecure email server during her time as secretary of state. "How do you lie to the FBI and now you’re running for president?" Trump questioned. "How does that happen?" The crowd began chanting, "Lock her up!" "You know, I’ve been saying lets just beat her on Nov. 8, but you know what? I’m starting to agree with you. Every time I mention her, everyone screams ‘Lock her up! ’" Trump responded. "I’ve been nice, but after watching that performance last night  —   such lies  —   I don’t have to be so nice anymore. I’m taking the gloves off. "
