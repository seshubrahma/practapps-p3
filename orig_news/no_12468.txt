Former U. S. Navy SEAL officer and founder of Blackwater USA Erik Prince told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon in speaking of the recent attack in Nice, France, "This is a war against their paradigm. It is a war against Islamic fascism. They are at war with us. We are clearly not at war with them. My question to France is, where is your Charles Martel? Where is the guy that stops a Muslim radical invasion?   …     Where is that kind of French leadership? "[As for the world looking to the United States for leadership, Prince said, "Unfortunately, I think they’re going to have to wait till January and hope Mr. Trump is elected because, clearly, our generals don’t have a stomach for a fight. Our President doesn’t have a stomach for a fight, and the terrorists, the fascists, are winning. "  Prince faulted U. S. military leaders in Afghanistan for not pushing back forcefully against Obama’s "ridiculous rules of engagement" and said "we should be done with fighting     police measures   …     and actually fight and engage in combat and destroy the enemy. " He also completely supported Newt Gingrich’s recent call to test Muslims in America to see if they are supportive of sharia law. "This truck attack proves that the jihadists don’t need weapons, that gun control is a false argument in the United States. This is the same thing that Chinese Islamic terrorists did in Beijing a couple of years ago, driving a truck through Tiananmen Square, doing the exact same thing,"  Prince added.
