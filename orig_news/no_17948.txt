’  ’ ’   Sam Altman is an investor who lives in Silicon Valley. He voted   for Hillary Clinton, but spent the months following the election   interviewing as many Donald Trump supporters as he could find. ’ ’   He traveled throughout the United States to better understand   what the other half of America was thinking and feeling. ’ ’   He asked 1oo Trump supporters about all sorts of key issues,   ranging from abortion to immigration. ’ ’   When it came to immigration, he learned something that   surprised him. ’ "   Many people who voiced concerns about immigration weren’t   frustrated that immigrants might be taking job opportunities   from them.
