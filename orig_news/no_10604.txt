An African American Trump supporter was admitted to a local Cleveland hospital after being shot during a political argument in a bar, reports say. [Paul Jones, Jr. 60, was talking politics with the other patrons at a Cleveland bar named Winston’s Place when one of the others in the room apparently took offense that a black man could be a Trump supporter.  The black assailant wasn’t part of the initial discussion, the victim told ABC Channel 5. "He butted in the conversation," the elderly Air Force Vietnam War veteran told reporters. "The conversation wasn’t directed at him or to him. " Police reported that the man walked out of the bar, then returned with a pistol and with little warning shot the victim in the thigh. "People today," Jones’ mother Latosca said, "if you don’t think like they do, they are ready to cause problems. " "I’m quite sure you have a lot of people having their own opinions. But that doesn’t mean you should hurt somebody because you have your own opinion," the victim’s mother added.  Police are still searching for the shooter who, if found, will be charged with felonious assault. The injured Trump supporter is expected to make a full recovery.
