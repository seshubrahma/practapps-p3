"If Trump were elected we would be at War in no time at all. The whole World is laughing at us right now," Madonna wrote. "I can only imagine what Trump writes in his  .   he even Write?? Wake up People this is not a reality show. I appreciate his charm and entertainment value but he is not qualified to be a Head Of State! FACTS! Vote Clinton or we are all F*CKED. " Madonna followed up by posting what appeared to be a homemade graphic featuring the plea: "Vote Hillary bitches. "  Yep ❣🇺🇸🙏🏻🇺🇸🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃 A photo posted by Madonna (@madonna) on Nov 6, 2016 at 12:04am PDT,  The singer has become increasingly vocal in the home stretch of this year’s election. In September, Madonna joined fellow pop star Katy Perry in shedding her clothes to encourage voters to head out to the polls. While warming up for comedian Amy Schumer at a concert in New York City in October, Madonna told the thousands in attendance at Madison Square Garden that she would perform oral sex on anyone who cast a vote for Clinton, boasting that she makes "a lot of eye contact" during the act. Madonna had been relatively quiet about the election before September, but her support for Clinton may represent a case of family ties the Washington Post reported in 2007 that Clinton and the   singer are tenth cousins.
