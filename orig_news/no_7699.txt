Columnist and author of "Adios, America," Ann Coulter said that the "sore losers" in the Republican Party over Donald Trump clinching the nomination "know how I feel when [Sen. John] McCain ( ) was running" but that "I wasn’t as much of a little b*tch as George Will is being" on Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s "Real Time. "  Coulter said, "The party is not split. Trump has gotten more votes than anyone else running in a republican primary. You are talking about a few sore losers. Now they know how I feel when McCain was running. So I hope they’re enjoying it. And by the way, I wasn’t as much of a little b*tch as George Will is being. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
