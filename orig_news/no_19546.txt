’  ’ ’"   ’ ’  ’ ’     To understand Trump, you have to set aside the  he gave before     his election and the  he has released since. You     also have to set aside the caricature of him as a         woman hater who will deport every immigrant     he can find. Instead, look at the four interviews he has given     since his election: to the Wall Street Journal, 60     Minutes, the New York Times, and a group of TV     anchors and executives. In these exchanges, all of them     conducted outside the   context of the campaign,     you’ll see how squishy he is. Trump  a  and he’s a  to the country and the world. But     it’s not because he’s a strongman. It’s because he’s a     weakling.   ’ ’     That’s the short version. The longer story is more complicated.     Here are the various facets of Trump’s personality, how they     fit together, and why they make him dangerous.   ’ ’1. He’s all about reciprocal love. In the     campaign, Trump often played on fear and hate. He targeted     Muslims, refugees, undocumented immigrants, and any other     scapegoat that served his interests. But deep down, what he     wanted was the love of his adoring crowds. Emotionally, he’s a     child. He can love others, but only if they love him first. And     that’s how he sees his presidency. In his  on Nov. 22, he explained that his job is     "taking care of the people that really have proven to be —  to     love Donald Trump. "   ’ ’2. His reflexes are vindictive. When Trump was     down in the polls, he railed against Hillary Clinton, the     press, and fellow Republicans. On election night, he said those     grudges were . But they weren’t. In       tweets, he   and the cast of . He      for     supporting ongoing recounts, even after they  and     said they just wanted to make sure the recounts . He summoned TV     executives to Trump Tower on Nov. 21,  the "," and      them for . The     next day, in his meeting with the Times, he bragged     that he had stiffed job requests and pleas for campaign help     from two Republican Senate candidates who had failed to support     him. That’s how Trump behaves on his political honeymoon.     Imagine what he’ll do when the going gets rough.   ’ ’  ’ ’3. His ego is fragile. After winning the     Republican nomination in May, Trump gloated about it for     months. Now he’s gloating about the election. In tweets and     interviews, he has  that he beat Clinton     ". " On Tuesday, he ran     another victory lap,  the addition of     Michigan to his ". " To understand     how central this is to Trump’s sense of himself, check out the     first 19 paragraphs of his interview with the Times.     Invited by the publisher to give opening remarks, Trump spoke     at length, not about the future but about his genius and     prowess on the campaign trail. In his Nov. 11 interview with      he     bragged about the number of Twitter followers he had gained.   ’ ’     A   who is   doesn’t behave this way.     Nor does he snap at a   sketch comedy show. Nor does     he summon TV executives to complain that  they     have aired are . Trump     does these things because he’s deeply insecure and easily     wounded.   ’ ’4. He craves approval. Trump often comes       across as indifferent to the feelings of others. That’s       misleading. He cares intensely about being respected and       loved. Consider his twisted relationship with the       Times. For two weeks after the election, he tweeted       that the paper was "," "," and ". " Despite this, he requested a meeting and       showed up at the paper’s offices to wag his tail. He promised       Times staffers an immigration bill that "even the       people in this room can be happy" with. He told them "it       would be, to me, a great achievement if I could come back       here in a year or two years   …     and have a lot of the folks       here say, ‘You’ve done a great job.’ And I don’t mean just a       conservative job, ’cause I’m not talking conservative. I mean       just, we’ve done a good job. " Yes, Mr. President. Good boy.     ’ ’5. He’s easily soothed by flattery. Trump is       a champ at nursing grudges when he feels cheated, threatened,       or disrespected. But his grudges, like his commitments, can       be washed out by small doses of affection. He speaks       glowingly of generous   phone calls he received       from the and the . He has  in       return. Those threats to prosecute Hillary? . Trump also       can’t stop clucking about his Nov. 10 meeting with President       Obama. At least  Trump has        to have "" with the       man he had never previously met and had repeatedly denounced       as the .       That’s how easily Trump’s wrath can turn to warmth —  and vice       versa.     ’ ’  ’ ’6. He’s a softie. If Trump hurts a lot of       people as president, it won’t be out of malice. Calling       Clinton a "" from the       safety of a podium, or threatening a few flag burners with        is easy. But Trump doesn’t have the stomach to       face down millions of angry Americans. On 60       Minutes, he backed away from talk of deportation,       criminalizing abortions, and reopening the legal debate over         marriage. If Roe v. Wade were overturned,       said Trump, the worst thing women might have to endure is       that "they’ll have to go to another state. " As for LGBT       people, he pleaded, "I mentioned them at the Republican       National Convention! And everybody said, ‘That was so great.’       " Trump might not understand the effects of his policies or       appointments, but he knows what he needs: praise. He’s not an       attack dog. He wants to be petted.     ’ ’7. His emotional softness makes him morally       weak. Trump’s critics see him as a thug who will       damage the country and the world through aggression. That       could happen. But he’s far more likely to usher in bad things       by being a lapdog when we need a watchdog. To take a small       example: Three men who had partnered with Trump in a real       estate project in India met with him after his election, took       pictures with him, and . When the Times asked Trump about       this, he pleaded: "What am I going to say? ‘I’m not going to       talk to you’? ‘I’m not going to take pictures’?   …     On a human       basis, you take pictures. "     ’ ’         Trump was just being nice. But that kind of niceness can         cause trouble. During the campaign, Trump said he would         keep jobs in the U. S. by threatening companies that plan to         move their operations elsewhere. But as           he’s not using threats. He’s using bribes. He described to         the Times one of "numerous" conversations he’s had         with CEOs since the election. "We’ll create the incentives         for you," Trump told the executive. "We’re going for a very         large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy         about. " So the jobs will stay. But they’ll be funded by         taxpayers, and employers will control the transactions.       ’ ’         Trump is a patsy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, too.         He effused to the Journal about a "" letter Putin         sent him after the election. "I would love to be able to         get along with Russia," Trump told the Times. He         claimed, based on reactions at his rallies, that getting         along with Russia would also make Americans happy: "I’d say         this in front of thousands of people.   …     ‘Wouldn’t it be         nice if we actually got along with Russia? Wouldn’t it be         nice if we went after ISIS together?’   …     And the people         [would] stand up and give me a massive hand. "       ’ ’  ’ ’         Trump treats the presidency the way he treated The         Apprentice: . There’s no limit         to the moral lines he would cross to give the audience what         it wants. In the Times interview, he said he might         withdraw his support for waterboarding if it were found to         be ineffective at extracting useful information. But he         added: "If it’s so important to the American people, I         would go for it. I would be guided by that. "       ’ ’8. He substitutes popularity for standards of         conduct. Trump sees the moral universe in terms of         feelings, not rules or reasons. He told the Times         he could combine his presidency and his business any way he         chose. Anything he did to limit conflicts of interest, he         asserted, would be out of the generosity of his heart. He         also suggested that he didn’t have to sweat conflicts of         interest because voters, by electing him, had shown they         didn’t care about them. "Prior to the election it was well         known that I have interests in properties all over the         world," he . "Only the         crooked media makes this a big deal!"       ’ ’         Trump is just as dismissive about financial transparency.         "Are you gonna release your tax returns?" Lesley Stahl         asked him on 60 Minutes. "Nobody cares," Trump         replied. "Obviously, the public didn’t care, because I won         the election very easily. " He gave a similar brushoff to         concerns about his   political style. The         Journal reported that it had asked Trump "whether         he thought his rhetoric had gone too far in the campaign. "         His answer, according to the paper: "No. I won. " Winning         means people don’t mind what you did. And if they don’t         mind, then what you did wasn’t wrong.       ’ ’9. He confuses controversy with mystery.         Because Trump deals in emotions rather than facts, he’s         easily swayed by intensity. Even in matters of science,         he’s more affected by the number of people who believe         something than by the evidence for their beliefs. "There         are few things where there’s more division than climate         change," Trump told the Times. "There are people         on the other side of that issue. " He went on: "My uncle was         for 35 years a professor at M. I. T.   …     He had feelings on         this subject. It’s a very complex subject. I’m not sure         anybody is ever going to really know. "       ’ ’         What expertise did Trump’s uncle have in climate         forecasting? Not much, since the uncle specialized in         . What evidence did he have? Again, not much,         since he . But         he did have "feelings," as Trump points out. So do all         those "people on the other side. " The only scientific         instrument Trump needs is a finger in the wind.       ’ ’  ’ ’10. He’s obtuse to the pain he inflicts.         If Trump cares so much about feelings, why doesn’t he see         all the fear and stress he has caused? Because that would         require him to accept criticism, and his ego can’t handle         it. On 60 Minutes, he batted away questions about         his invective during the campaign, insisting that "my         strongest asset is my temperament" and that he "can’t         regret" anything he’d said. If some folks are upset by his         election, that can’t be his fault, so it has to be theirs.         "There are people, Americans, who are scared, and some of         them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against         you, against your rhetoric," Stahl told him. Trump seemed         baffled. "That’s only because they don’t know me," he said.       ’ ’         Trump is virtually lobotomized. Unable to acknowledge his         role in  he blames         others. When Stahl told him that "African Americans think         there’s a target on their back," and "Muslims are         terrified," he shrugged that such fears were "built up by         the press, because, frankly, they’ll take every single         little incident   …     and they’ll make [it] into an event. " In         his interview with the Times, Trump claimed that         low black turnout showed how popular he was: "A lot of         people didn’t show up, because the           community liked me. " The vanity of this man is bottomless.       ’ ’11. He feels the pain of his allies, not the pain         of people different from him. Trump sees no need to         reassure the ethnic or religious communities he in the campaign.         On Nov. 10, when he visited the U. S. Capitol, a reporter         called out, "Are you going to ask Congress to ban Muslims         from entering the country?" Trump heard the question,         replied, "Thank you, everybody," and . The next         day, in his interview with 60 Minutes, he         belittled reports of racial slurs from his supporters,         calling them "a very small amount. " When a Times         staffer asked him about a conference of Trump sympathizers         who had "pledged their allegiance to Nazism," Trump         expressed surprise that reporters were still pestering him         about such things. "Boy, you are really into this stuff,"         he said. He uttered four words of intransitive         boilerplate —  "I disavow and condemn" —  and moved on.       ’ ’           But when people who feel threatened by Trump challenge           his friends, he rushes to defend his friends. On Nov. 18,           Vice President —  elect Mike Pence went to see           Hamilton. After the show, the cast delivered a           short  to Pence on           behalf of "the diverse America who are alarmed and           anxious that your new administration will not protect           us. " The message concluded: "We truly hope that this show           has inspired you to uphold our American values and to           work on behalf of all of us. " Trump responded by           attacking the cast on Twitter, charging that they had           "" Pence and           violated the theater as ". "         ’ ’           Trump also rose to the defense of his   man,           Steve Bannon, after a Times reporter asked about           Trump’s appointment of Bannon, "who has been described by           some as racist and " to a White House job.           Trump called Bannon "a decent guy" who had "been treated           very unfairly. " The exchange was bizarre in part because           Bannon himself, in an interview at the Republican           National Convention in August, had proudly declared,           ". " Yet Trump assured the Times:           "I’ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was           a racist, or   or any of [those] things   …     I           wouldn’t even think about hiring him. " Trump doesn’t fuss           about Bannon’s record. He just thinks: He’s my           friend, so he’s good, and whatever he said is OK.         ’ ’  ’ ’12. He’s easily manipulated. Having a           fragile,   narcissist as president isn’t           the end of the world. It just means that to get him to do           the right thing, you have to pet him. In Trump’s             exchanges, we have several useful models.           The first is Obama, who gave Trump a tongue bath in their             meeting on Nov. 10 and may have saved his           signature legislative achievement in the process. Three           days after that meeting, Trump told the Journal           he was reconsidering his pledge to abolish Obama’s health           insurance program: "Either Obamacare will be amended, or           repealed and replaced. "         ’ ’           The second model is Times columnist Tom           Friedman. In the group session at Times           headquarters on Nov. 22, Friedman worked Trump like a           horndog in a bar, trying to get him into bed on climate           change. "You own some of the most beautiful links golf           courses in the world," Friedman told Trump. "I’d hate to           see Royal Aberdeen underwater," the columnist added. When           Trump ragged on windmills, Friedman whispered sweet           nothings: "General Electric has a big wind turbine           factory in South Carolina. " Trump, eager for approval,           told the Timesstaffers about his "many           environmental awards" and bragged, "I’m actually an           environmentalist. " By the end of the session, Friedman           had Trump eating out of his hand.         ’ ’           The third model is a story Trump told about his threat to           narrow the First Amendment. During the primaries, Trump           had  to "open up           our libel laws so when [journalists] write purposely           negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them           and win lots of money. " But in his meeting with the           Times, Trump said someone had later warned him,           "It’s a great idea, softening up those laws, but you may           get sued a lot more. " "You’re right, I never thought           about that," Trump recalled telling this person. And that           reflection led Trump to assure the Times that on           the question of libel laws, "You’re going to be fine. "         ’ ’             The fourth model is Jim Mattis, the retired general who              to be considered for secretary of defense. Trump             asked Mattis about waterboarding, which Trump             supported. "I’ve never found it to be useful," said             Mattis, according to Trump’s account of their             conversation. "Give me a pack of cigarettes and a             couple of beers, and I do better with that than I do             with torture," the general told him. Trump told the             Times that he was "very impressed by that             answer," especially because it came from "the toughest             guy. " Waterboarding, Trump concluded, was "not going to             make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of             people think. "           ’ ’             That’s how you move Trump. You don’t talk about ethics.             You play the toughness card. You appeal to the art of             the deal. You make him feel smart, powerful, and loved.             You don’t forget how unmoored and volatile he is, but             you set aside your fear and your anger. You thank God             that you’re dealing with a narcissist, not a               killer. And until you can get him safely             out of the White House, you work with what you have.             People in other countries have dealt with presidents             like Trump for a long time. Can we handle it? Yes, we             can.           ’
