"   CNN on Friday apologized after one of its producers was caught on   a hot mic making a joke about   Donald Trump’s   plane crashing. " ’   "An unfortunate and inappropriate remark was made by one of our   producers off camera yesterday," a CNN representative told   Business Insider in a statement. "We have apologized to the Trump   transition team, and the producer has been disciplined." ’ ’   As correspondent Suzanne Malveaux prepared for a live shot at   Carrier’s Indianapolis plant on Thursday, a producer was heard   discussing various hand signals with her. ’ ’   "That means his plane’’s crashed  —   just kidding," the producer   said, prompting a stunned face from Malveaux. ’ ’ ’ ’   Trump has strongly criticized CNN for months. ’ ’’ ’   During the campaign he referred to the outlet as the "Clinton   News Network," and, according to reports,  during a recent     meeting with top television executives. ’
