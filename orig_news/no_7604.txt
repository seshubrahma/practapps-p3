Monday on CNN’s "At This Hour," while discussing the FBI reopening the investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Rep. Steve Cohen (  TN) called on the FBI director James Comey to resign.  Cohen said,"The FBI has to be held to a high standard, and it is. We give the FBI director a   term so they’re immune from politics and can do their job. Their job is to investigate and give information to the U. S. attorneys to bring prosecutions or not. There are long standing protocols to say that the FBI director and justice officials aren’t supposed to comment on investigations because it could prejudice the investigation. It could prejudice the target of the investigation. And an election season with it so close to the election, it could influence the outcome of the election, who people vote for and what they think. " "And there was very little knowledge that director Comey had at the time of what was in these emails," he continued. "There’s no reason to believe that there’s anything there that shows that Secretary Clinton had any intent to violate the law which is the basis upon which he chose not to recommend or to bring an indictment this past summer. There’s no reason that’s changed. But given Donald Trump a lot of movement. He takes an ounce and creates a grand canyon and he’s taken this too far. It’s violated the oath. The FBI has been hurt and justice has been hurt. " He added, "I think he was excessively, excessively careless in making a statement that the time. And the FBI director is supposed to be beyond that.
