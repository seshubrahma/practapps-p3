(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. U. N. officials suspended all humanitarian convoys in Syria, a day after a deadly aerial attack on a convoy of 31 aid trucks authorized to travel in the   country. "Just when we think it cannot get any worse, the bar of depravity sinks lower," the United Nations secretary general, Ban   said at the opening of the General Assembly in New York. Syria, Russia and the United States denied responsibility, but the U. S. officials said Russia may have carried out the attack. _____ 2. New details emerged about Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey, including that he was turned in as a terrorist to the F. B. I. two years ago  —   by his father, an Afghan immigrant, above. But officials said that the father had recanted, and that agents did not interview Mr. Rahami himself, who was in jail, accused of stabbing his brother. Friends said Mr. Rahami seemed to change after traveling abroad. He went to Pakistan several times, staying for nearly a year in Quetta, the headquarters of exiled Afghan Taliban leaders as well as generations of Afghans who fled the violence in their country. The woman he married there has been detained. Our reporter retraced his likely path from the train station in Elizabeth, N. J. to the doorway of a bar where he was found sleeping on Monday morning. _____ 3. The bombings came at a critical point for the presidential campaign, pushing national security to the forefront with the first presidential debate a week away and Election Day in just seven weeks. But it’s likely that neither Hillary Clinton’s counterterrorism plan nor Donald Trump’s would have prevented the attacks, and neither addresses the most common trajectory of radicalization in the U. S.: personal demons that morph into ideologically driven violence. At a time when polls are being intensely scrutinized, our statistical expert examines how different pollsters starting with the same data can make very different conclusions. _____ 4. Donald Trump’s campaign once again drew derision from critics, this time for Donald Trump Jr. ’s comparison of Syrian refugees to a bowl of skittles with a scattering of poisoned candies. And Samantha Bee clobbered NBC and her fellow   TV host Jimmy Fallon for a friendly interview with Mr. Trump. "Network execs, and a lot of their audience, can ignore how very dangerous Trump is because to them, he isn’t," Ms. Bee said. "They’re not going to be deported. " _____ 5. President Obama, making his final address to the U. N. Nations General Assembly, said that globalization needed to make a "course correction. " "A world in which 1 percent of humanity controls as much wealth as the other 99 percent will never be stable," he said. He also cautioned against insularity, saying, "Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself. " Here is our full coverage of the General Assembly. _____ 6. Our book reviewer got an advance copy of Bruce Springsteen’s memoir, "Born to Run," which he compares to one of Mr. Springsteen’s shows: "long, ecstatic, exhausting, filled with peaks and valleys" and "part séance and part keg party. " And there’s even news: The singer has suffered depressions so deep that he’s turned to the powerful   drug Klonopin. _____ 7. Senator Elizabeth Warren led a bipartisan chorus of censure against John Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, for protecting senior managers’ jobs and his own compensation after revelations that workers had opened millions of unauthorized accounts in customers’ names. She accused him of driving workers "to the breaking point" with aggressive goals of " "  —   persuading customers to avail themselves of more bank services. "And when it all blew up," she said, "you kept your job, you kept your   bonuses. " _____ 8. Video of the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Okla. has prompted federal and local investigations. The victim, Terence Crutcher, was shot after walking to his vehicle with his hands up. The view from a patrol car’s dashboard camera and a helicopter flying overhead was obstructed in the moments before he was Tasered and then shot. His family held a news conference, calling for charges to be filed against the white officer who shot him, Betty Shelby. _____ 9. We’ve been following the uproar over extrajudicial killings in the Philippines in the weeks since the new president, Rodrigo Duterte, inaugurated a war on drugs. One of Mr. Duterte’s most outspoken critics, Senator Leila de Lima, above, was just stripped of her post as head of a panel investigating the hundreds of killings and put under investigation over allegations that she had received payoffs from drug lords. She said she was the victim of a "new McCarthyism. " _____ 10. A celebrity breakup doesn’t usually qualify as top news, but this one involves a Hollywood powerhouse and an influential international philanthropy. Yes, Brangelina is fracturing back into Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. No explanations were offered, and both individuals asked the media to respect the family’s privacy. _____ 11. Finally   …     enough. Just don’t. Play Leonard Cohen’s "Hallelujah. " Anymore. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
