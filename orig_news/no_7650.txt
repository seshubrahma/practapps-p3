Over the Memorial Day Weekend, Bill Kristol doubled down on his betrayal of this country with a pair of tweets:["Just a heads up over this holiday weekend: There will be an independent candidate  —   an impressive one, with a strong team and a real chance," Kristol tweeted.  He also said, "Those accused of betraying GOP by opposing Trump can take heart from P. Henry 251 years ago today: ‘If this be treason, make the most of it! ’" This fatuous invocation of an American patriot to justify the betrayal typifies the arrogant disregard for political realities shared by all those involved in a defection that could produce even greater disasters than the Obama era’s 400, 000 deaths by jihad and 20 million refugees across the Middle East. A week earlier, a "Never Trump" diatribe appeared in National Review, written by Charles Murray. To summarize why "Trump is unfit outside the normal parameters" to be president, Murray cited these words by NY Times columnist David Brooks: Donald Trump is epically unprepared to be president. He has no realistic policies, no advisers, no capacity to learn. His vast narcissism makes him a closed fortress. He doesn’t know what he doesn’t know and he’s uninterested in finding out. He insults the office Abraham Lincoln once occupied by running for it with less preparation than most of us would undertake to buy a sofa   …     He is a childish man running for a job that requires maturity. He is an insecure boasting little boy whose desires were somehow arrested at age 12. This is a perfect instance of "Trump derangement syndrome," the underlying animus that motivates Kristol and his destructive cohorts. Dismissing Trump as an ignoramus and a stunted    is the stuff of schoolyard   not a serious critique of someone with Trump’s considerable achievements. Yet this is typical of Trump’s diehard opponents on the right. Is Trump more unprepared than Barack Obama whose qualification for the presidency was a lifetime career as a   agitator? And how did that work out? Despite the lacunae in his executive resume, Obama is now regarded as "one of the most consequential presidents in American history" by reasonably qualified experts. Can Trump be reasonably criticized, and is he something of a loose cannon? Of course he can, and yes he is. But criticisms that focus exclusively on the candidate miss the larger reality of this election, which is not merely a contest between two candidates but a clash between two parties and constituencies with radically differing views of what this country is and should be about, and even more importantly about the threats we face and how to deal with them. Obama’s most consequential domestic legislation is the Affordable Care Act, which he had no part in writing. It was the work of   think tanks and the congressional Democrats. So it will be with Trump, which is why all the blather about his vagueness or impracticality on policy issues is beside the point. Will he build a wall the length of the Mexican border? Probably not. But will he secure the border? Probably so. Will a Democrat  —   whether Hillary, Bernie, or Joe Biden  —   secure our borders and stop the flow of illegal immigrants, criminals, and terrorists? Certainly not. In addition to their   war for amnesties and open boarders, Democrats are responsible for the more than 350 "Sanctuary Cities" that openly defy federal law and provide safe havens for those same illegal immigrants, criminals, and terrorists. Open borders, Sanctuary Cities, importing unvetted Muslim refugees from the Middle East are but the tip of the iceberg in assessing the threat that the Democratic Party and its candidate (whoever it is) pose to America’s national security. For   years since the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, the Democratic Party has been the party of appeasement and retreat in the holy war that fanatical Muslims have declared on us. The first bombing of the World Trade Center misfired but still killed six people and wounded 1, 000 others. Clinton never visited the site while his administration insisted on treating it as a criminal act by individuals who needed to be tried in criminal courts, an attitude that would culminate in Barack Obama’s refusal to recognize that we were in a war at all, and certainly not one with fanatical Muslims. To a man and woman, the Democratic Party’s elected officials continue to participate in and support this denial. Following the first World Trade Center bombing, there were three more devastating attacks on American assets by  ’s barbarians during the Clinton administration, with no response and no change of mind towards the nature of the threat. There were also massive security breaches, including the theft by Communist China of America’s nuclear arsenal and the publishing of all our hitherto classified data from America’s nuclear weapons tests. Clinton’s leftist Secretary of Energy published the reports for the world to see, as she put it, "to end the   culture. " Following the   attacks, the Bush administration focused on Afghanistan, which had provided   with a base to attack us, and Iraq, which had violated 16 Security Council resolutions designed to enforce the Gulf War truce that Iraq’s dictator Saddam Hussein had repeatedly violated and prevented him from reviving the massive chemical and nuclear weapons programs we had destroyed. In 1998, Saddam threw the U. N. weapons inspectors out of Iraq, a further violation of the Gulf War truce and a clear sign of his determination to revive his weapons programs. Embroiled in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Clinton fired 451 cruise missiles into Iraq, a pointless response that was correctly seen by critics at the time as an attempt to deflect attention from his appearance before the grand jury looking into his personal disorders. The Bush administration put 200, 000 troops on Iraq’s borders, which prompted Saddam Hussein to   the inspectors but then to throw obstacles in their path. Bush went before the UN and secured a 17th Security Council resolution, unanimously passed, in the form of an ultimatum to Saddam to destroy any weapons of mass destruction he possessed and provide proof that he had done so. Bush also went to Congress and got an authorization for the use of force from Senate but not House Democrats. The ultimatum date came and went, and to prevent the word of the United States and the commitment of 200, 000 troops from meaning nothing, Bush proceeded to invade Iraq. But before he did so, he gave Saddam the option to quit the country in which case the invasion would be called off. A simpler measure would have been to assassinate Saddam since he was the Iraq problem. But thanks to a law passed by the   Democrats the CIA is prevented from assassinating foreign leaders, which made the invasion necessary. Within three months of the invasion, with American troops still in harm’s way, the Democrats who had authorized the use of force and spoken in favor of the removal of Saddam turned against the war and began a   campaign to sabotage it. The Democrats reversal  —   and betrayal of our men and women in arms  —   was triggered by a presidential primary in which a   candidate, Howard Dean, was running away with the Democratic nomination. This betrayal prevented us from pursuing Saddam’s generals and chemical weapons into Syria, and bringing Assad to heel. Bush managed to rescue the war effort and defeat   on the battlefield through the "surge" that Democrats opposed. But then, Obama took charge and implemented the Democrats’    platform of appeasement and retreat, creating a power vacuum in Iraq and Syria that ISIS quickly filled. At the same time, the Democrats have systematically taken down our military which is now at its lowest levels since World War II. This is the issue that defines the coming election. A party in denial about the Muslim holy war against America and its allies, whose basic instinct is to weaken America’s defenses and enable her enemies, is opposed by a party that wants to rebuild America’s strength, secure our borders, and put the safety of our people first. The Kristol attack on the Republican Party and its presumptive candidate Donald Trump is an attack on all Americans and needs to be seen in that light.
