’  ’ "   Sam Altman, the Silicon Valley investor behind the     firm Y Combinator, has some thoughts about Donald   Trump’s tax returns. " ’   Tweeting from his personal account on Saturday, Altman said    of the GOP presidential nominee’’s   tax returns "in the interest of citizens being able to make a   fully informed choice in this election." ’ ’   "Even though he can release his returns under audit, and there’’s   precedent for this, it seems like he won’’t," Altman said. ’ ’   Trump has refused to release his tax returns, despite it being   the customary move for   US presidential candidates.

The   Vermont senator routinely condemned the influence of big banks in   politics and attempted to cite Clinton’s   speeches as   evidence of that. " ’   For her part, Clinton has indicated that she’’s open to showing   the public those transcripts "." ’
