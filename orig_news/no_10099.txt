Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is hammering rival Hillary Clinton for allegedly fabricating the "Youtube video" explanation for the deadly Benghazi terror attack in 2012. [On Tuesday, Trump portrayed Clinton, Obama’s former Secretary of State in a damaging light as she tries to position herself as a more moderate and trusted foreign policy choice than Trump:   Hillary has bad judgment!
