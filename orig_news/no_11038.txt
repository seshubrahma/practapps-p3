(Adult Language Warning)  Wednesday on TBS’s "Full Frontal," while discussing   Donald Tump’s victory in her monologue, host Samantha Bee said it was "pretty clear" who ruined America: white people. Bee said, "In the coming days, people will be looking for someone to blame: the pollsters, the strident feminists, the Democratic party, a vengeful god. But once you dust for fingerprints, it’s pretty clear who ruined America: white people. I guess ruining Brooklyn was just a dry run. The Caucasian nation showed up in droves to vote for Trump, so I don’t want to hear a goddamn word about black voter turnout. How many times do we expect black people to build our country for us? White people, this is the worst thing we’ve ever  —   no, I’m sorry, that’s a very high bar. But holy shit, and don’t try to distance yourself from the bad apples and say, ‘It’s not my fault, I didn’t vote for him, hashtag not all white people.’ Shush. If Muslims have to take responsibility for every member of their community, so do we. " (  RCP Video) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
