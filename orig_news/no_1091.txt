(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. There are new twists in the investigation into Russian meddling in the election. The day before the congressman leading the House inquiry announced that President Trump or his associates may have been "incidentally" swept up in surveillance of foreigners, he met with someone on the White House grounds who showed him secret intelligence reports. Democrats called the timing suspicious. And Senate investigators plan to question Mr. Trump’s    and adviser, Jared Kushner, above, about his discussions with Russian officials. _____ 2. The bruising failure of the Republican bill to overhaul health care will complicate Mr. Trump’s next challenge: trying to remake the  tax code. Stocks briefly tumbled on Monday over concerns that he may not prevail there, or with infrastructure spending. The grand plans of lower rates, fewer loopholes and a tax on imports may have to be scaled back to a big corporate tax cut and possibly an individual tax cut. A lot of people think Mr. Trump will settle for an easy win. "They have to have a victory here," said an economist with the Heritage Foundation. _____ 3. The United States is sending 240 more soldiers to Iraq to help the Iraqi military recapture the city of Mosul from the Islamic State. That will push the United States deployment to well over 5, 000 troops. A wave of civilian casualties is raising questions about changing military priorities. Our reporters found a scene of horror and weary survivors at one block flattened by bombing runs by the United   coalition. Some counts put the toll at up to 200. _____ 4. Disruption after disruption for Russia. The opposition leader Aleksei Navalny, above, was jailed a day after the largest antigovernment protests in more than five years. More than 1, 000 demonstrators were arrested in Moscow alone. And truck drivers across the country appeared to be preparing to set up roadblocks near major cities to protest a new highway toll system. _____ 5. Drought and war are heightening the threat of four concurrent famines. In Somalia, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen, aid agencies are scrambling to prepare for what they say could become one of the largest humanitarian crises since World War II. _____ 6. Since taking office last summer, the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has made it open season on drug dealers and users, calling for the police and vigilantes to kill suspects. We sent a video crew to get a closer look. Their   documentary, "When a President Says, ‘I’ll Kill You,’" follows a local photojournalist struggling to capture the death, grief and fear filling the streets. _____ 7. A really big heist: The world’s largest gold coin was stolen from a museum in Berlin. Investigators suspect it took more than one burglar to haul away the   Canadian Big Maple Leaf, worth more than $4 million. _____ 8. The Raiders are leaving Oakland. Again. N. F. L. owners voted overwhelmingly to let the team move to Las Vegas, no longer worried that proximity to the gambling world could corrupt the game. The Raiders are the third N. F. L. team to move, or announce a move, in just over a year, as owners hunt for bigger markets and more public financing for new stadiums. _____ 9. Art or appropriation? Some in the art world are outraged over a white artist’s painting of Emmett Till lying in his coffin, on display at the Whitney Biennial. And in our latest   newsletter, Times journalists list phrases that make them cringe  —   like "exotic," "urban" and "ethnic. " (Sign up for the newsletter here.) _____ 10.
