In a Monday interview with Boston radio show "Kirk and Callahan" on WEEI, New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady discussed his longtime friend and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.  Brady defended his move to walk out after a question about Trump’s "locker room talk," saying he did not want to be a distraction to his team. He also added Trump has always supported him and encouraged him over their    relationship, adding that he has "always had a good time with him. " "I met [Trump] I guess probably 15, 16 years ago," Brady said. "We’ve played golf together many, many times and I’ve always had a good time with him. He’s been a friend of mine. He’s supported our team. He’s supported the Patriots. He’s been on the Patriots’ sidelines a lot and always called me after games to encourage me over the course of 15 years. That’s kind of the way it is. " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
