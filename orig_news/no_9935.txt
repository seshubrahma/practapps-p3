Conservative radio host Glenn Beck  —   who recently endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz ( )  —   touted   socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) as more honest than GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. ["Honesty, faith and truth are basic requirements. And quite honestly, I have to tell you, this probably isn’t going to go over very well, that’s why I like Bernie Sanders," the former Fox News host said. "Bernie Sanders is like, ‘Yep, I’m a socialist.’  Beck reportedly slammed Trump for not asking for forgiveness from God and supporting the Wall Street bailout. "The other guy has said he hasn’t done anything in his life that actually makes him feel like he should ask forgiveness from God," Beck said, referencing Trump. "The hubris of that is astonishing, as if for the last eight years we have watched a narcissist in the Oval Office and it has meant nothing to us. " He then touted Sanders for his honesty. "I can actually sit at a table with a man who says, ‘Yes, I’m a socialist, and yes, I don’t like what we are doing, we should be more like Denmark,’ " Beck said of Sanders. "What we really need in America is enough of these politicians who are telling us what we want to hear, hiding behind fancy language, and actually have a debate between a constitutionalist like Ted Cruz and a socialist like Bernie Sanders," Beck added.
