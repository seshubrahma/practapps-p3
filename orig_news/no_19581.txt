’  ’ ’   Like many Americans, entrepreneur and software developer Krishna   Kaliannan was taken aback by the 2016 election. ’ ’   "I was very shocked when Trump won," Kaliannan said. ’ ’   In the   to Election Day, Kaliannan said he was fairly   certain Hillary Clinton would win the White House, and the   variety of news he was getting from his Facebook News Feed seemed   to support that. ’ ’   "I was almost completely left in the dark as far as how a very   large number of Americans felt about Donald Trump and what   direction they wanted to take the country in," Kaliannan said. ’ "   Noting the discrepancy between what he thought was happening and   what was actually happening, he developed  a   Google Chrome extension that inserts news stories into a user’s   Facebook News Feed. The extension is designed to expose users to   political views that are different from their own. " "   Once installed, Escape Your Bubble asks users to identify whether   they want to learn about Republicans or Democrats and inserts   stories into their feeds that align with the political leanings   they wish to be exposed to. The extension then adds one clearly   marked story that falls outside of the user’s established   political viewpoint every time a user visits the social network. " ’   Facebook has recently been criticized for its role in   —   forms of disinformation and propaganda   that some have speculated may have affected the election. ’ ’   Last month a  showed that several fake news stories on   Facebook significantly outperformed stories from legitimate news   sources in the days leading up to the election. ’ ’   As Facebook has become an   source of news for some   Americans, questions have risen about how the social network will   develop stronger editorial standards. ’ "   In its attempt to curate news, Kaliannan acknowledges that Escape   Your Bubble may be wading into the same issues plaguing Facebook.   He says that’s why he is taking a cautious approach to how much   the extension influences what users read, ostensibly by inserting   only one opposing story at a time. " ’  ’ ’   Currently, Kaliannan and a team of about 12 volunteers choose   news stories and opinion pieces from a variety of major news   outlets that are then shown to users to help balance out their   regular diet of news. The selection process is informal, meaning   Kaliannan and his volunteers use their own judgment when   verifying and selecting reading material. ’ ’   For instance, a user with liberal political leanings can be shown   an article with the headline  from The Pew Research Center, a   nonpartisan think tank, that they may not have otherwise seen on   their Facebook feed. ’ ’   Kaliannan asserted that it’’s "dangerous to show people things   they disagree with," suggesting that doing so could cause some   people to dig their heels in and reject the information. ’ ’   There is some evidence that appears to support this.  note that users who are exposed to media that   contradicts their political views may question its credibility,   thus reinforcing their own opinion in what is known as the   "backfire effect. " ’ ’   According to Kaliannan, Facebook should be held accountable for   how it serves up news to users. But there is also an onus on   users to be mindful about news sources they choose to consume. ’ ’   "This is not a problem that can be solved entirely by software,"   Kaliannan said. "People need to understand and they need to be   taught that seeking out a diverse set of opinions is a   constructive way to broaden your world view." ’
