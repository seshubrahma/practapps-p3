LeBron on Donald Trump: "That’s not locker room talk. That’s trash talk." pic. twitter.  Wednesday, Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James was asked about about GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s "locker room talk" that was picked up on a hot mic during a 2005 conversation with Billy Bush.  James, who referred to Trump only as "that guy," called Trump’s words "trash talk" instead of "locker room talk" because that type of conversation does not go on in locker rooms. "What is locker room talk to me?" James replied to a reporter. "It’s not what that guy said. We don’t disrespect women in no shape or fashion in our locker rooms. That never comes up. I got a    a wife, a mom and a daughter and those conversations just don’t go on in our locker room. " "What goes on in our locker room is sporting events that might have happened the night before, about family, about strategies that we may have that night, about a highlight that may have happened, if there was a home run in the bottom of the ninth or an   dunk play from the night before," he continued. "That’s what happens in our locker room. What that guy was saying, I don’t know what that is. That’s trash talk. " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
