.@mike_pence: Hillary is in hiding, Trump is everywherehttps:  .  Monday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends," Republican   nominee Gov. Mike Pence ( ) questioned the whereabouts of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her availability to the press while her opponent Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been "everywhere. "  The Indiana governor raised the questions about Clinton as there are unanswered questions involving her family’s charity, the Clinton Foundation. "Look, Hillary is in hiding and Donald Trump is everywhere," Pence said. "I mean look, I think she has gone more than 250 days without a press conference and you know, it is time for her to step forward and begin to answer these questions. And not just these questions, but questions about the Clinton Foundation. Now we hear the Clintons are going to stop fundraising for the Clinton Foundation if she is elected president presumably because that would be a conflict of interest. Well, the American people wonder why wasn’t it a conflict of interest when she was secretary of state, the   constitutional officer in charge of our foreign policy?"
