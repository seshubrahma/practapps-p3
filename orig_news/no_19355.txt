’  ’ ’   More than 42 million people have voted early this year,   including a record 6. 4 million in Florida and a soaring number of   Latinos, signs that bode well for Hillary Clinton one day before   Election Day. ’ ’   Meanwhile, the data suggest close races in other key battleground   states such as North Carolina, Iowa, and Colorado. ’ ’   A   surge in Latino voters boosted the numbers in   Florida, which saw more than 1. 5 million early votes more than it   did in 2012, according to  run by University of Florida professor Michael   McDonald. ’ ’   Many of the Latino early voters in Florida were     voters, and the data are cause for concern for Trump.    just 12. 5% of the 30, 000   Floridians who registered to vote last month are Republicans. ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’   Florida is a critical state for Republican nominee Donald Trump,   who has virtually no credible paths to the White House   without its 29 electoral votes. Clinton and Trump are neck and   neck there, according to a  of recent polls. ’ ’   Daniel A. Smith, a University of Florida professor who runs the   politics blog ElectionSmith, painted an equally grim picture for   Trump in the Sunshine State. The Latino turnout for early   voting alone this year is likely to exceed the entire Latino vote   from 2012, . ’ ’   The picture seems a little brighter for Trump in North Carolina,   where early voting ended on Saturday.  Democratic turnout was down from 2012,   while Republican turnout increased by 125, 000. Although more   Democrats voted early in general, it may not be enough to hold   off Trump on Election Day, when North Carolina Republicans turn   out in heavier forces.  ’ ’   The deciding factor in North Carolina may be independents  —   more   than 800, 000 unaffiliated voters came out for early voting this   year, a 42% increase from 2012, CNN reported. ’
