Donald Trump  said his comments about a Hispanic judge  —   suggesting he would not be able to handle a case against the   Trump University fairly because of his heritage  —   had been misconstrued. Mr. Trump spoke after Speaker Paul Ryan, above, called Mr. Trump’s criticism "the textbook definition of a racist comment" and "absolutely unacceptable. " ______ 3. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, goaded by concern over a possible Trump presidency, showcased an unusually cooperative approach on his second visit to the White House in two years. He took crucial steps toward ratifying the Paris climate accord and finishing the purchase of nuclear reactors, with a military deal to come. "Modi wants to get as much as he can out of Obama’s last months in office," an analyst said. ______ 4. More than 350, 000 people have signed a petition for the recall of a California judge who sentenced this Stanford University student, Brock Turner, to only six months in jail after he was convicted of sexual assault.

" ______ 7. In a rare victory against prison abuses, five New York City correction officers were convicted of all charges in the beating of a Rikers Island inmate in 2012.
