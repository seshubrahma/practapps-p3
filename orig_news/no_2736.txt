Children aren’t the only fans of St. Nicholas, that is, Santa Claus. He’s a hit with pawnbrokers, too. His feast day is celebrated today across Europe with reminders of his legend of leaving gold coins in shoes for boys and girls. He’s the pawnbrokers’ patron saint  . The business of offering quick cash for personal items has been criticized for exploiting the poor. But some say the spheres that hang outside pawn shops are meant to symbolize St. Nick’s generosity, evoking the bags of gold he is said to have used to save three sisters from being sold into slavery. Another theory is that the spheres originated with the Medicis, the powerful Italian bankers who sponsored artists during the Renaissance. Golden circles appear on their family crest. That may explain how New York City’s power brokers came to admire St. Nick. "The religion the world wants today," a guest at a banquet devoted to the saint said in 1900, "is a religion like that of St. Nicholas, that lays the hands of brotherly love upon the crying needs of our helpless brethren.
