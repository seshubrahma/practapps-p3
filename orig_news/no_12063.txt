Monday on MSNBC’s "Andrea Mitchell Reports," Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker said the only chance Sens. Ted Cruz ( ) and Marco Rubio ( ) have to defeat party   Donald Trump would be to combine forces and go after Trump jointly.  Parker suggested the two focus on showing that Trump is not for the "little man" to a core demographic of Trump supporters that she described as "high school educated" and "blue collar. " "I’ve come back to this sort of concerted effort to show people who are taken with his emotional appeal to see clearly who he really is," Parker said. "He’s done so well with these people with who are high school educated, and I don’t mean this in a demeaning way at all, but it’s the fact, and the more blue collar workers who really are the heart of America and they think finally somebody is speaking for them but the truth is he is not for them not in his real life and that needs to be highlighted. " "I think Marco Rubio is not interested in attacking Donald Trump because look what happens to everyone who attacks him, but also he wants this to be a two man race. But I’m not he can get there. I’m not sure either Cruz or Marco Rubio is strong enough to bring down Trump alone," Parker said. (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
