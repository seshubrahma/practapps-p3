Eric Trump, the son of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump said that his dad doesn’t need the endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) on Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s "Kelly File. "  Trump said his father has "got tens and tens of millions of votes. I mean, he’s really run away with this. He has more votes than any Republican in any primary ever. I mean, the guy’s done an incredible job. He really has grown the party. He has brought the party together for whatever that’s worth. And listen, if he doesn’t have the speaker’s vote, if he doesn’t have the  —   his will, or whatever it may be, we’ll go on, right?   …     Would it be nice? Yes, is the ultimate goal to beat Hillary Clinton? Yes, that’s everybody’s goal. No one wants her to be president. It would be an absolute disaster. So, sure, everybody should band together, and they should march forward. If he doesn’t have it, will life go on? Absolutely. " (  The Hill) Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo,
