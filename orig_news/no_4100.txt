The CEO of Squatty Potty, Bobby Edwards, discussed his decision to pull his company’s ads featuring Kathy Griffin after the release of a photo of Griffin holding a faux bloody decapitated head of President Donald Trump. [Said Edwards, "My heart fell into my stomach," when he saw the image. "I was totally disappointed and heartbroken and I thought this campaign   …     we have to kill it. We cannot have her with this image  …    . "  Edwards said his product is for everyone and he doesn’t want to alienate anyone. "When you see an image like that that’s so divisive and so disturbing, you don’t have a decision, really," added Edwards. "It was the total disrespect for the office of the presidency and decorum and the way we conduct ourselves   …     it crossed the line and was very offensive, not only to me but to people I love.
