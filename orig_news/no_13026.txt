"["Some represented Bernie, our communist friend," Trump told his supporters during his morning campaign rally in Dayton, Ohio on Saturday, recalling the protesters the night before in Chicago. "Bernie should tell his people  …     he should really get up and say to his people, ‘Stop, stop. ’"  "We cannot let our First Amendment rights be taken away from us folks, we can’t let it happen," Trump charged. "We have a right to speak. We are   people. We’re people that work very hard. " "We’re all together and we want to get along with everybody, but when they have organized,   wise guys, we got to fight back," Trump defended. "What happened yesterday was incredible. We dealt with law enforcement so good. We love our police," Trump stated when he first began discussing the protest. "We dealt with law enforcement at every level. Secret Service  —   great, the whole group, it was determined that if we go in, it could cause bad vibes. " "The people that came there were so nice," he said, defending his supporters who came to attend the campaign rally. "They caused no problem. They were taunted. They were harassed by these other people. " "They said, ‘Mr. Trump should get up and this morning tell his people to be nice," the real estate mogul said of critics. "They’re nice. My people are great. " "We’re going to unify the country," he stressed, arguing President Obama has been a divisive president.
