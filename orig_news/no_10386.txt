Joel Kotkin writes at the Daily Beast: The Great Rebellion is on and where it leads nobody knows. Its expressions range from Brexit to the Trump phenomena and includes   and unconventional insurgent movement around the world. It shares no single leader, party or ideology. Its very incoherence, combined with the blindness of its elite opposition, has made it hard for the established parties across what’s left of the democratic world to contain it. What holds the rebels together is a single idea: the rejection of the   crony capitalist order that has arisen since the fall of the Soviet Union. For two decades, this new ruling class could boast of great successes: rising living standards, limited warfare, rapid technological change and an optimism about the future spread of liberal democracy. Now, that’s all fading or failing. Living standards are stagnating, vicious wars raging,   migrants pouring across borders and class chasms growing. Amidst this, the crony capitalists and their bureaucratic allies have only grown more arrogant and demanding. But the failures of those who occupy what Lenin called "the commanding heights" are obvious to most of the citizens on whose behalf they claim to speak and act. You can read rest here.
