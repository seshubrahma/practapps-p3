GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is mocking the decision by rival Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) to select Carly Fiorina as his potential vice presidential pick. ["A new relationship has started, Cruz and Carly," Trump said to roughly 7, 500 people at a campaign rally in Indianapolis. "Cruz can’t win. What’s he doing picking vice presidents?"  "He’s mathematically eliminated," Trump added. "He has set a record, though. He is the first presidential candidate in the history of this country who is mathematically eliminated from becoming president who chose a vice presidential candidate. It’s a record. " "I wish him well, but folks they’re not going to do it for you," Trump said of Fiorina and Cruz. "He called the rim the ring so he doesn’t know too much about the basketball world," Trump jabbed about Cruz misspeaking the night before in reference to a basketball rim. "I don’t like the way that Kasich eats," Trump said, taking a jab at Ohio Gov. John Kasich. "I don’t like the way that Cruz talks," he added.
