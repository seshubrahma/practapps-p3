GOP frontrunner Donald Trump took to Twitter on Saturday morning, commenting on the Internal Revenue Service auditing him  —   a claim he made during Thursday’s GOP primary debate  —   and also going after rivals Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ). [I unfairly get audited by the I. R. S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why?  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 27, 2016,   Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit, no problem!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 27, 2016,  I am   my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 27, 2016,  Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version  —   amazing people!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 27, 2016,  Trump also responded to the charge Rubio made during the debate that Trump was given $200 million dollars by his father. Trump argued he was given a one million dollar loan and paid it back. I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn’t  —   total fabrication!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 27, 2016,  I started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 27, 2016,  During the debate in Houston, Texas on Thursday, Rubio charged, "Here’s a guy that inherited $200 million. If he hadn’t inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now? Selling watches. " Trump responded, "No, no, no. That is so wrong. We’ll work on that. I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion. "
