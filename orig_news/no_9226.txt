"[Gary Weeks, 51, of Queens was charged with attempted murder, aggravated harassment, and obstruction of government administration, the New York Daily News reported.  The bystander was waiting at the    subway station at 125th St. and Lexington Ave. for a northbound train when Weeks tried to push him onto the tracks. The victim was able to escape as other people tried to point and yell at the attacker to cool down. He then began yelling about his hatred for whites. Police said he spit on an officer as officers tried to arrest him. This isnâ€™t the only time a bystander was attacked on the New York City subway these past few weeks. A woman was accused of pushing a bystander in front of the subway tracks in October, and a man was attacked on the subway in November for wearing a Trump hat.
