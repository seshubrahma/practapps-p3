Sunday on NBC’s "Meet The Press," presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort said the Democratic presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton is the "epitome of the establishment" that was rejected by the voters of the Untied Kingdom in the Brexit vote.  Partial transcript as follows: TODD: Let me start with Brexit. What I want to know is whether Donald Trump believes what happened in the UK is in the best interests of the United States. He said it was good for the UK, and I understand that. But does he believe what happened is in the best interests of the United States? MANAFORT: Well, you have to understand what happened there. What happened with Brexit was people taking back control. I mean, the faceless bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasburg who have ruled and told the Brits how to live, making promises to them that their lives would get better, and talking about a future based on globalism versus family and individual and local community. That’s what Brexit was all about. And the reality is those are the same issues that have caused the angst in America today. This election in 2016, where Donald Trump is the only change agent, is set up perfectly on those same themes because Hillary Clinton is the epitome of the establishment. She’s been in power for 25 years. and the issues, the promises that globalism is the solution, the promise that government is going to make your life better if you just give up your freedoms, the promises that we know better than you on how to make your lives better have been rejected. That’s what Donald Trump has identified. That’s what Brexit identified. That’s what’s going to be the basis for the election in 2016. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
