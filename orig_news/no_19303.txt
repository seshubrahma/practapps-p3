’  ’ ’   The polls have consistently showed Hillary Clinton with a lead   over Donald Trump in recent weeks, but an artificial intelligence   system has a different prediction for the outcome of the   presidential election. ’ ’   The system, called MogIA, uses 20 million data points from   online platforms like Google, YouTube, and Twitter to come up   with its predictions,  CNBC. MogIA correctly predicted the past   three presidential elections as well as the Democratic and   Republican primaries. ’ ’   "While most algorithms suffer from  ’’s   biases, MoglA aims at learning from her environment, developing   her own rules at the policy layer and develop expert systems   without discarding any data," Sanjiv Rai, the founder of   Indian   Genic. ai who developed MogIA, told CNBC. ’ "   MogIA uses data such as engagement with tweets and videos posted   to the platforms the system looks at. It found that Trump has   overtaken President Barack Obama’s engagement numbers during the   2008 election by a margin of 25%. " "   To be fair, participation on social media networks wasn’t as   robust in 2008 as it is today. And the MogIA system can’t always   analyze whether a post about Trump is positive or negative,   making it difficult to gauge actual support. " ’’ ’   Still, the system has been right in the past. In other elections,   the candidate with the most engagement online won. ’ ’   "If Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time   in the last 12 years since Internet engagement began in full   earnest," Rai wrote in a report obtained by CNBC. ’ "   This isn’t the only rumble about polls possibly being wrong. " ’   A professor who has accurately predicted the outcome of every   presidential election since 1984  that Trump is most likely to win,   based on a model he developed that uses a series of     statements to determine who is best positioned to take   the White House. ’ ’  ’
