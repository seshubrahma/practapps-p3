Gay rights advocates have condemned the Trump education department for inviting groups that advocate for one   woman marriage to a Father’s Day event. [GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign, which claim to be "inclusive," slammed The U. S. Education Department for inviting Family Research Council (FRC) and Focus on the Family  —   groups that support traditional marriage  —   to participate in a panel at a Father’s Day event, reports Politico. The panel focused on how   organizations can help fathers to become more involved in their children’s education.

"Our children deserve to learn in a place that’s inclusive and open to their needs, and that’s at risk should an unqualified person run the Department of Education.

"As a Hispanic pastor, he understands the importance  —   particularly in minority communities  —   of involving fathers in every aspect of their children’s lives," writes FRC president Tony Perkins.

"As far as I’m concerned, promoting fatherhood isn’t a Republican issue or a Democratic issue  —   it’s an American issue," Perkins continues. "When we support dads, we’re not just giving kids a better shot at life we’re improving it for us all. We applaud the Department of Education for putting the spotlight for academic success where it belongs  —   at home. "
