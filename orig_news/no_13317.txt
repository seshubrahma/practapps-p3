GOP frontrunner Donald Trump plans to list several of his possible Supreme Court Justice picks this week, "seeking to ease concerns among conservatives that he would appoint liberal justices if he is elected president," according to The New York Times. ["You might have five Supreme Court justices to be picked over the next four years, because we already have one, and you’ll probably have four more," Trump stated. "So you could change the balance of the court very quickly, very easily. "  The New York Times reports that Trump made the comments during his speech on Sunday night at the Palm Beach County Republican Party Lincoln Day dinner, adding, "Trump acknowledged that there were questions about the type of justices he would choose for the court if he were president. " "So what I’m going to do is, I’m going to get between five and 10 judges that everybody respects, likes and totally admires," Trump told the attendees, saying he would "guarantee it personally, like we do in the world of business, which we don’t like to do too often, but I will guarantee it that those are going to be the first judges that I put up for nomination if I win. "  The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman reports, "A spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said late Sunday night that Mr. Trump would release the names of those judges sometime this week. " Trump also told the media during a press conference on Monday afternoon that the Heritage Foundation is helping compile the list of Supreme Court Justice options.
