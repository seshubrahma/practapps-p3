Frank Gaffney, president of the Center for Security Policy, spoke to Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow regarding the upcoming Hillary   Trump    Forum hosted by Matt Lauer on Wednesday evening. ["The most searing indictment of Hillary, I believe, is her consistent support for, alignment with, and help to the Global Jihad," said Gaffney in discussing lines of attack Trump might choose to pursue during the forum.  Continued Gaffney: I don’t know how else to describe it —  whether it’s her help with the Iranian deal early on, or whether it’s her support for the overthrow of friendly governments in the Middle East. "Friendly" is a relative term, that they were sure more friendly than the Muslim Brotherhood, with which Hillary has aligned herself and supported, it seems to me, at just about every turn. And I think this is a place where Donald Trump can showcase the strong and necessary differences between the kinds of policy approach that he’s been laying out in a series of really important addresses. The event will be broadcast on NBC and MSNBC, as Breitbart News reported: The    Forum is a     event and will be broadcast live on MSNBC and most NBC stations starting at 8 p. m. Wednesday. Lauer, a former "notable member" of the Clinton Global Initiative —  a leadership arm of the highly controversial Clinton Foundation —  will moderate the event, which is being put on by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) organization here in New York City. "During this   forum, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be on stage    taking questions on national security, military affairs and veterans issues from NBC News and an audience comprised mainly of military veterans and active service members," MSNBC states. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
