’  ’ ’   I believe Kevin McCarthy was joking last June, when  that he thought Donald   Trump was in the pay of Vladimir Putin. ’ ’   But consider, for a second, why McCarthy would have   thought this joke would be funny. ’ ’   Consider what it says about what he and Paul Ryan and other   Republican leaders realized about Trump nearly a year ago  —   and   then went ahead and tried to get him elected president anyway. ’ ’   McCarthy didn’’t say "I think Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe   is paying Trump" because that wouldn’’t have been funny because it   wouldn’’t have made any sense. ’ ’   "Putin is paying Trump" worked as a joke because Trump had a   habit of taking Russia’’s side in major geopolitical disputes,   which was weird since Russia is a major geopolitical adversary of   the United States. ’ ’   It’’s like saying "Is Wendy’’s paying him?" about your friend who   won’’t shut up about Wendy’’s nuggets, except if Wendy’’s were a   hostile power that hoped to undermine Western democracies. ’ ’   Like many jokes, the humor here comes from the kernel of truth   behind it: Trump acted as though he was under Russian influence,   and it was reasonable to be worried that, if Trump became   president, he would put Russian interests ahead of American ones. ’ ’   There was reason to worry that Trump might, to pick a random   example, share sensitive intelligence with Russia in violation of   an agreement with an ally. ’ "   The 2016 campaign was stressful and unpleasant for a lot of us,   and a lot of us turned to gallows humor with our friends to cope.   I can’t imagine it was pleasant for McCarthy and Ryan to watch   their party nominate an intemperate   Russian stooge for   president, and I understand why they would have wanted to blow   off some steam. I made my share of dark jokes, too. " ’  ’ ’   But unlike McCarthy and Ryan, I lacked much power to stop this              man   from becoming president  —   and I tried to use what influence I did   have responsibly. ’ "   Instead of engaging in dark humor about how their party’s   presumptive nominee behaved as though he were a Putin employee,   maybe Ryan and McCarthy could have tried to stop him from   becoming president. " ’   They could have urged Republican convention delegates to nominate   somebody else, notwithstanding their pledges to Trump. ’ ’   They could have encouraged   voters to pick   somebody else. ’ ’   Failing that, they could have at least withheld their   presidential endorsements. ’ ’   Obviously, any of these courses of action would have had severe   political consequences for McCarthy and Ryan. But what a   patriotic American does, if he believes his party has nominated   someone for president whose loyalty to the country is suspect, is   break with that nominee even at significant political cost. ’ ’   Instead, McCarthy and Ryan joked about the awful nightmare they   would work for the next five months to foist upon their country. ’ ’   Ha ha. ’ ’I believe Kevin McCarthy was joking last June. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
