  World   Curt Schilling wants to send Hillary Clinton to the Big House rather than the White House. ["If she’s allowed to get to the general election before she’s in prison," the former pitcher told Kansas City’s 610 Sports, "I’ll be stunned and upset because I think she’s shown her true colors all along the way. And I’ll ask you this: Do you see her being anything even remotely different than what we’ve had?"  Schilling, who donated to Dr. Ben Carson’s presidential campaign, offered a similarly dim view of the Republican frontrunner, saying Donald Trump’s statements contain "no depth" and that his campaign relies on vague slogans. But he says he understands the impulse to raise "a giant middle finger to the establishment. " He just doesn’t understand Hillary Clinton’s continued success. "She’s done nothing," Schilling told host Danny Parkins. "She’s done absolutely nothing to further the success of the middle class. She jumps on the backs of people who she wants to be dependent on government. She needs these people to be dependent on her. " ESPN suspended the outspoken   of the 2001 World Series for the final month of the 2015 regular season for his political statements. He ran afoul of the Worldwide Leader in Sports for sharing a graphic on social media that compared the dangers of a small numbers of extremists in the Muslim world to the dangers of Germany containing a small number of extremists prior to the rise of Nazism. Schilling, who returned to his spot on ESPN during the playoffs, appears to continue to speak his mind despite his employer’s recent punishment for him exercising his freedom of speech. "I hope she does [go to jail]," Schilling said of Mrs. Clinton in his   interview Tuesday. "If I’m gonna believe, and I don’t have any reason not to believe, that she gave classified information on hundreds if not thousands of emails on a public server after what happened to General Petraeus, she should be buried under a jail somewhere.
