Many on the left allege Russia and President Vladimir Putin helped elevate Trump’s campaign, which he has vigorously rejected: If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2016,  Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the   card. It would be called conspiracy theory!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016,  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has declared that Russia was not the source of the leaked DNC and Hillary Clinton emails. However, President Barack Obama, the CIA and FBI have all maintained it was their Cold War nemesis behind the leaks, which included devastating revelations about key leaders in the Democratic Party. President Obama used the occasion of his last press conference of the year to drive the point again and to criticize Russia and President Vladimir Putin saying, "the Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC and, as a consequence, it’s important to review elements of that and prevent that interference in the future. This was not a complicated espionage scheme. It just took off —  and that concerns me. " While there has been no solid evidence to support claims that Russia interfered with the presidential election, it was the Obama administration that was found responsible for meddling with elections in Israel and failing to remove Prime Minister Benjamin "Bibi" Netanyahu last year. As Breitbart Senior    Joel B. Pollak pointed out: "In 2015, the Obama administration made a strenuous and     effort to swing the Israeli elections toward the opposition and away from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The State Department gave $300, 000 to a ‘ ’ Israeli group, which then paid political activists whose goal was to unseat Netanyahu. " Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope: @AdelleNaz
