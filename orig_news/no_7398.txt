Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is ready to fight Joe Biden, after the Vice President said he’d like to take Trump "behind the gym. "["I’d love that. I’d love that. Mr. Tough Guy," Trump said during a rally in Florida, after highlighting Biden’s comment.  "You know, he’s Mr. Tough Guy," he said.  Trump continued, mocking Biden for merely talking tough. "You know when he’s Mr. Tough Guy? When he’s standing behind a microphone by himself," he said. Trump appeared willing to take Biden up on his offer. "Some things in life you could really love doing," he said as the crowd cheered.
