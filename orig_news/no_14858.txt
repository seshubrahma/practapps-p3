 (CNN) A laptop with highly sensitive information was stolen from a Secret Service agent’s car Thursday morning in Brooklyn and has not been found, according to two senior New York law enforcement officials. The officials said the laptop, which was highly encrypted and contained floor plans and evacuation protocol for Trump Tower, cannot be traced or erased by officials remotely, leaving the information at risk of being discovered. The agent described the incident as a compromise of national security, according to one of the officials.  Also stolen were the agent’s lapel assignment pins that gave her access to security details that protected Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, the pope and the United Nations General Assembly.  The laptop and pins were in a backpack that was taken from the car, which was parked in the agent’s driveway. The backpack has since been found, but not the laptop. Secret Service spokeswoman Cathy Milhoan confirmed that the laptop had been stolen and that an investigation is underway. "Secret   laptops contain multiple layers of security, including full disk encryption, and are not permitted to contain classified information. An investigation is ongoing and the Secret Service is withholding additional comment until the facts are gathered," Milhoan said. "The Secret Service requests anyone with information regarding this crime to please contact the New York Police Department and the US Secret Service New York Field Office."
