’  ’ "   Congressional lawmakers are looking into whether Jeff Sessions   had additional undisclosed meetings with a Russian ambassador   before Donald Trump’s election. " ’   The inquiry centers around an April 27 event at the Mayflower   Hotel in Washington, D. C. in which US intelligence officials   said Sessions, who was a senator and a Trump surrogate at the   time, attended a VIP reception with Russian ambassador to the US   Sergey Kislyak, and others, . Trump was giving a   speech at the   hotel that day. ’ "   The FBI is conducting its own inquiry into the Trump campaign’s   activities with Kislyak at that event, the CNN report said. It is   part of a broad investigation of Russia’s meddling in the US   election, which was seen by investigators as the Kremlin’s bid to   help Trump beat Hillary Clinton " ’   It is not yet clear whether Sessions any other Trump surrogates   had a private meeting with the Russians at that April 27 event,   and any personal contact could have been incidental, the report   said. ’ "   Sessions acknowledged two previous meetings . A   Justice Department official said both instances were in Sessions’   capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and   not as a surrogate for Trump. " ’’ ’   Sessions failed to mention those meetings during Senate   confirmation hearings for his appointment as US attorney general,   which raised further questions about the multiple contacts   between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives during and   after the election. ’ "   Soon after news of Sessions’ meetings with Kislyak was reported,   Sessions recused himself from   investigative   matters at the Justice Department and updated his Senate   testimony to show that he did indeed meet with the Russians   before the election.
