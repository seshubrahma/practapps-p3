Columnist Pat Buchanan stated that "the president of the United States and this administration have zero credibility when it comes to illegal immigration," Democratic presidential candidates "basically welcome illegal immigration into the United States because 80 to 90 percent of them, after 15 or 20 years, are going to be Democratic voters" and "if the invasion of Europe and the United States are not stopped," both "will cease to exist" on Friday’s "McLaughlin Group. "  Buchana argued, "the president of the United States and this administration have zero credibility when it comes to illegal immigration, securing the American border. This is why Donald Trump has taken this issue and run with it all the way to be leading the polls in the Republican Party. What the president is doing is trying to give himself an image, I’m tough on border control, so maybe he looks good and can maybe get something else and work with folks on that. But I think Hillary and [Sen.] Bernie Sanders ( ) they tell where the Democratic Party is out. They basically welcome illegal immigration into the United States because 80 to 90 percent of them, after 15 or 20 years, are going to be Democratic voters. " He added, "My opposition is we’ve got a country and I don’t want to see it gone. " Later, Buchanan declared, "Take a look at Europe. It is being invaded. And if the invasion of Europe and the United States are not stopped, these  —   the continent and the country will cease to exist. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
