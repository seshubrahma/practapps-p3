Sunday on ABC’s "This Week," Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen Bob Corker ( ) said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is "going to have to change" to pivot to the general election.  Partial transcript as follows: STEPHANOPOULOS: What is the affirmative case for Donald Trump? Why are you competent he’ll be a good commander in chief. CORKER: He has an opportunity to transition. He’s talking to people I respect greatly, Secretary Baker. Dr. Kissinger are people that two of the most  —   the greatest foreign policy experts in our nation, so he’s talking to the right people. And it’s my hope that now that this primary decision  —   process is over, it’s like moving from the major leagues to the world series. It’s my hope that he will transition into that phase. He has an opportunity to really change the trajectory of our country. And it’s my sense that he will take advantage of that. I hope that he will. But we’ll have to see. STEPHANOPOULOS: He said this week he’s not going to change. CORKER: Well, I think that he’s going to have to change. And the fact is I’m not talking about him necessarily changing his views. But I think that he’s now moving into a different phase. He’s talking to the right people my sense is I spoke to Dr. Kissinger and Baker before and after the meetings and he’s asking all the right questions. Talking  to people all around the country that are experts in this regard and i think they know that they’re at a place where this campaign has to evolve. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
