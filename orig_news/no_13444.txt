"What we need is a    contest. If we have that, my son Ted will be the clear winner," Rafael Cruz told Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon on Breitbart News Daily. "The polls have indicated time and time again, that in a    exchange, Ted Cruz would beat Donald Trump by about 17 points," Rafael added. [During the interview, Bannon told Rafael, "I don’t understand why Kasich is still in," and asked if the establishment planned on using the Ohio governor to block an   candidate at a contested convention.  "They just want to get it to the convention floor," Rafael explained, adding that if the convention attempted to give the nomination to anyone other than Cruz or Trump, "There would be a revolt. " But Republicans need to rally to Ted Cruz, Rafael insisted, because Trump "change[s] all the time. He quoted Democratic Senator Harry Reid, who said he would prefer Trump to Cruz because in Reid’s words, "Trump is malleable. " As to why voters should prefer Cruz to Trump, Rafael explained, "This election really comes down to one word: Trust. Who can you trust to do what they say they are going to do?" Speaking of his son Ted, Rafael added, "With him, you can be sure he will honor the Constitution, the rule of law, limited government, free enterprise. He will appoint to the Supreme Court only justices who have a clear record of following the Constitution and not being judicial activists. " This echoes Ted Cruz from last night, who contrasted himself with Trump by asking, "Do you want a candidate who shares your values? Or do you want a candidate who has spent decades opposing your values?"
