Saturday, former DNC pollster Cornell Belcher said on MSNBC’s "AM Joy" that white voters saw   Donald Trump as the "great white hope" who would "give them their country back. "  "Look, this ideal that the Democrats need to spend more time having a conversation with white voters is patently absurd," Belcher told host Joy Reid. "We spend 80 percent of our resources right now chasing this mythical, unicorn white swing voter. The truth of the matter is, look, we’re not winning more   white voters because we’re racially polarized. These people want their country back and they saw Donald Trump as the strong, great white hope to give them their country back. " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
