’  ’ ’   Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke will not join the   Department of Homeland Security as an assistant secretary, his   adviser Craig Peterson told  on Saturday. ’ ’   "Late Friday, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr. formally   notified Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly that he had   rescinded his acceptance of the agency’’s offer to join DHS as an   assistant secretary," Peterson said. ’ ’   "Sheriff Clarke is 100 percent committed to the success of   President Trump and believes his skills could be better utilized   to promote the president’’s agenda in a more aggressive role." ’ ’   Clarke previously said he would start the DHS job in June. ’ "   The news comes just weeks after Clarke was embroiled in a    controversy, after CNN’s KFile reported that he   had failed to properly cite sources in at least 47 parts of his   master’s thesis.
