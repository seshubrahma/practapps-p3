  John Legend blasted   Donald Trump and predicted his " " rhetoric could turn the United States into Nazi Germany in an interview this week. ["I feel like it’s dangerous for us to be complacent. It’s dangerous for us to think that it couldn’t happen to us like it happened to Germany in the ’30s and ’40s," the "Love in the Future" singer said when asked about his 2015 Academy Awards acceptance speech in a Hollywood Reporter roundtable this week.  "Trump is saying   things in public," Legend continued. "The world and America have done some atrocious things in the past, and we could do it again if we had the wrong leadership and if people of conscience don’t speak up. " Legend was a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton’s failed White House bid, performing last summer at an   concert fundraiser for the former Democratic nominee. The Grammy winner has repeatedly attacked Trump on Twitter, calling him a "racist" in one memorable social media battle with Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr.   Tori Amos followed Legend’s comments during the   QA and said, "We all have to deal with the DSA, the Divided States of America. We have to deal with the emotions. " Legend is far from the only celebrity to have compared the   to Hitler. In no particular order, other celebrities and public figures who have made the comparison include Cher, Spike Lee, Bill Maher, Louis C. K. Roger Waters, Whoopi Goldberg, Eva Longoria, Sarah Silverman, Billie Joe Armstrong, Maynard James Keenan, Russell Simmons, Ken Burns, and some cast members of Saturday Night Live.
