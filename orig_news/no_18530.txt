The    company is up 22% over   the past 30 days alone. Since its 2010 IPO, it’s up almost   1, 300%. " "   During this period of time, the carmaker has rarely notched a   profit and is still selling less than 100, 000 vehicles per year   to the millions moved by its   peers. For what   it’s worth, Tesla is also selling electric cars in a market that   doesn’t want them  —   EV sales are only about 1% of the global   market. " ’   But people sure want to buy Teslas! The company has over 400, 000     for its forthcoming Model 3, slated to launch in July. ’ "   With positive sentiment about Tesla running very high ahead of   that event, it doesn’t look as if there’s much to slow down the   stock before Independence Day. " ’   The stock has monumentally outperformed the S&P 500 since the   beginning of the year  —   at a time when the markets were enjoying   a "Trump Bump"  . It’’s a rocket. And the obvious   questions is, "How much momentum, with Tesla’’s current business   challenges, does the company have left?" ’ ’  ’ ’What could be more   than the newest. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
