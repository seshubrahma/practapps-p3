Washington (CNN) Donald Trump defended Thursday calling Hillary Clinton a "bigot," arguing that her policies are a personal reflection because she knows they are destined to fail minority communities. Trump and Clinton are each portraying the other as discriminatory toward   with Trump charging on Wednesday evening that the candidate herself was hateful. Pushed by CNN’s Anderson Cooper if Trump meant to make a personal argument about Clinton as opposed to a policy argument, Trump doubled down. "She is a bigot," he said. "She is selling them down the tubes because she’s not doing anything for those communities. She talks a good game. But she doesn’t do anything." Asked if he believed Clinton personally hated black people, Trump claimed: "Her policies are bigoted because she knows they’re not going to work." In an interview with Cooper on Wednesday, Clinton responded to Trump’s initial slam by saying he was "taking a hate movement mainstream. He’s brought it into his campaign."
