Monday night while campaigning in San Diego, CA, Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) went after his rival Donald Trump for complaining about the Colorado Republican presidential primary process.  Cruz said, "Look, what we know in California, whine is something best served with cheese. And Donald Trump has this very idea of Colorado, he has been on TV all day long saying Colorado was terrible. They stole the election. Donald Trump 65, 000 people voted in the state of Colorado. They just didn’t vote for you. They voted for our campaign. Or to put it more simply, Donald Trump, it ain’t stealing when the voters vote against you. It is the voters reclaiming this country and reclaiming sanity. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
