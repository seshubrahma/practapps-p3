"We blame Donald Trump for this. Trump and his drama has created Islamophobia. " Another Imam, whose name is unknown at the moment, also blamed the real estate mogul and former NYC mayor for the shooting. "For those in leadership like Trump and Mr. Giuliani, and other members of other institutions that project Islam and Muslims as the enemy, this is the end result of their wickedness," the Imam said at a gathering of Muslims protesting the shooting. Other Muslim gatherings were chanting "This is Donald Trump’s fault," and "Muslim hate crime. " Witnesses providing leads to the NYPD described the shooter as a tall man of Hispanic descent. The NYPD is currently conducting an extensive canvass of the area for video and seeking additional witnesses as the shooter remains at large.
