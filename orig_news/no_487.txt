[The New York Times] • We’re in Week 2 of New Year’s resolution month, when we’re helping you stick to your goals. If you joined last week, welcome back. If not, there’s still time to participate. A key to staying motivated is to create habits that take away the opportunity to slip up. This is a concept my colleague Charles Duhigg has explored: "At the core of every habit is a neurological loop with three parts: a cue, a routine and a reward. To understand how to create habits  —   such as exercise habits  —   you must learn to establish the right cues and rewards. " This article tells you how to do that. I can attest to the power of this approach, and we want you to try it out yourself. Email us with one habit that would support your resolution, and how you’re going to create it. Near the end of the month, we’ll check back in with some of these and see how you did.  —   Tim Herrera, Smarter Living editor • Recipe of the day: For a step away from weeknight pasta, try your hand at ricotta gnocchi. • Cameroon’s national soccer team defeated Egypt to win its fifth Africa Cup trophy. • After 49 years, the   band Black Sabbath chose Birmingham, England, for what it said was its final concert. • Esquire magazine, long a men’s bible, looks to chart a new course in an era of transgender bathrooms and pink hats. • Queen Elizabeth II of Britain celebrates her sapphire jubilee today, marking the 65th year of her reign. • Alex Lewis lost his arms and legs to a blood infection.

Last week, the actor Peter Capaldi made headlines when he announced he would be leaving his starring role on "Doctor Who," the   British television series about a   alien. The Doctor  —   who isn’t referred to as Doctor Who  —   is a Time Lord from a distant planet who explores the universe in a time machine called the Tardis (which stands for Time and Relative Dimension in Space). A plucky human companion usually accompanies the Doctor, who faces a rotating cast of alien adversaries. Originally conceived as a   educational program, the series began in 1963 and, with the exception of a   gap ( ) has been broadcast since. The show is a national institution in Britain and a cult favorite elsewhere in the world, with more than 800 episodes (a Guinness world record). The Doctor is capable of regenerating, a concept that was introduced to prolong the series when its first lead actor, William Hartnell, left amid failing health. Mr. Capaldi, above, is the 12th actor  —   and the 12th white man  —   to fill the role. Fans have urged the producers to address the lack of diversity when the 13th Doctor makes his  —   or her  —   debut.
