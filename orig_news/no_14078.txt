She is returning to New York in advance of the school week and will be splitting her time between Washington and New York for the next few weeks," her spokeswoman told CNN Sunday.  President Donald Trump told reporters in November that Melania and their son, Barron, 10, would join him at the White House "very soon. Right after he finishes school."  Sunday also happened to be the Trumps’ 12th wedding anniversary.

Though it’s unclear how the Trumps will celebrate this anniversary, it’s sure to be eclipsed by the pomp and circumstance of the inaugural weekend and the adjustment to White House life.  The Obamas celebrated eight anniversaries, on October 3, in Washington, often dining at local restaurants, including Georgetown’s Bourbon Steak, Alexandria’s Restaurant Eve, and West End’s Blue Duck Tavern.
