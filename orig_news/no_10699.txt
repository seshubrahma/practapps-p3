Hillary Clinton is touting her   policies, so NumbersUSA is out with a new video showing former President Bill Clinton echoing presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump on the topic of immigration. [The video, released by the immigration reduction group Monday on social media, splices clips of former President Clinton’s 1996 State of the Union address with video of Trump speaking about illegal immigration and border security.  "This administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders," Bill Clinton says in the   video. Trump follows Clinton’s clip with, "We will build a wall. It will do what it’s supposed to do. Keep illegal immigrants out. " In another section of the video, Bill Clinton says, "We should honor every legal immigrant here, working hard to be a good citizen But we are also a nation of laws. " Trump again follows Clinton, "We are a country, we have to have laws. Either we have a country or we don’t," he says.  Chris Chmielenski, NumbersUSA’s director of content and activism, told Breitbart News that the video was simply made for social media and that currently NumbersUSA does not plan to use it for a larger media campaign. "Our Facebook specialist has been playing around the soundbites from Clinton’s ’96 SOTU [speech] and tried matching it up to some of Trump’s statements," he wrote in an email to Breitbart News. "When we posted it to Facebook last night, we thought it might do well, but we didn’t think it would get a million views after 12 hours!" he said. "We shared it in some other places  —   Twitter, Reddit, etc.  —   to help it get some legs, but our goal certainly wasn’t to have it picked up by RCP and Drudge," he said. "That was just a bonus.
