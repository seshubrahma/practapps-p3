The FBI is piecing together Mateen’s radical Islam roots, and the trips to Saudi Arabia could be a sign of his growing religious devotion. His stated reason for both the 2011 and 2012 trips was umrah, a Muslim pilgrimage to the Kingdom that is not as significant as the hajj, a trip all Muslims must make to Mecca at least once in their lives. Either or both of the trips could also have included a side trip.   …     "It’s not cheap to do so and people that young usually don’t go twice," said Adnan Khan, former leader of the Council of   Affairs.

Let’s not forget: President Obama’s hasty and   withdrawal from Iraq, which Hillary Clinton supported, created the vacuum that enabled the rise of this terrorist group. Their failure to secure Libya after their military intervention gave ISIS a beachhead on another continent. Democrats want to talk about anything else because they have lost the national security debate. "Nothing President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing in response to the Orlando terror attack would have prevented it, but they would infringe on Americans’ constitutional rights to due process and to own a gun. We should not make it harder for   Americans to defend themselves when radical Islamic terrorists are successfully launching attacks on U. S. soil. The terrorists win when they convince politicians they should take away our rights, and that is exactly what President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing.

Law enforcement experts say the   police wait definitely led to more deaths. The decision by law enforcement to hold off on entering the Pulse club  —   where more than 100 people were shot, 49 of them killed  —   immediately raised questions among experts in police tactics. They said the lessons learned from other mass shootings show that officers must get inside swiftly  —   even at great risk  —   to stop the threat and save lives. "We live in a different world.

Scott also called for the federal government to share more information with their state counterparts in the wake of the shooting. While he did not specify how more sharing of information might have prevented the massacre, Scott said it was broadly important that federal officials share what they learn with local law enforcement  —   especially in immigration or refugee cases.
