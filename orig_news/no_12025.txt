Jason Miller, Trump’s communications director for the transition team, was asked about the report that Melania and Barron are not moving to the White House during a reporter call Sunday morning. "No formal statement has been released yet," he responded, saying one will be coming. "There’s obviously a sensitivity to pulling their ten year old out of school in the middle of the school year," Miller added. "Melania is extremely close to Barron, and they have become closer during the campaign," said a source close to Trump’s transition team. "The campaign has been difficult for Barron, and she is really hoping to keep disruption to a minimum. " Another source said that Melania’s primary focus is on Barron, although she will travel to the White House as needed. There is a possibility that Melania and Barron will move into the White House full time at the end of the school year, according to multiple sources.

Trump Tower has had heightened security measures since July, but security has tightened following the presidential election. Shoppers have to go through security screenings and are subject to bag checks, and W 56th Street is closed to all traffic between Fifth and Madison Avenues. An unknown number of secret service agents will be assigned to Melania and Barron, and a driver and an armored vehicle will take Barron to school, said security expert Jim Reese. He added that agents will arrive at the school ahead of time to make sure its safe.
