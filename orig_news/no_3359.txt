The liberal media is claiming President Donald’s Trump frustration with an adversarial press is a threat to democracy and the press’s vital role in preserving it. [But former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said Trump should put his words into action, citing recent remarks by the president that he might stop the daily briefings at the White House.  "What they ought to do is get out of all this junk, they ought to focus on the big goals, they ought to report to the nation on the big goals, ignore all these reporters, close down the press room, send the reporters off [to Starbucks]," Gingrich said on Fox News’s Hannity.

S. government," the statement from WHCA President Jeff Mason said. "Doing away with briefings would reduce accountability, transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U. S. system, no political figure is above being questioned. " "The White House Correspondents’ Association would object to any move that would threaten those   principles," said Mason, who also works as a reporter with Reuters.
