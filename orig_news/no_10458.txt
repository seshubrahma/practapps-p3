American Music Awards   Gigi Hadid was roasted on social media Sunday night after performing what some critics called a "disgraceful" and "disrespectful" impression of future First Lady Melania Trump at the beginning of the annual awards show. [During her opening monologue Sunday night, the    model told her   comedian Jay Pharaoh, that she’d been working on the impression "all week" and took a moment to "get the face right. "  "I love my husband, President Barack Obama and our children, Sasha and Malia," Hadid said, mocking the future First Lady’s European accent and her speech at the Republican National Convention last summer. "I got through it! We’re good!" Gigi shouted. Pharaoh, a former regular Saturday Night Live cast member also delivered his own Donald Trump impression. "I love Bruno Mars. I don’t know what color he is, so I can’t deport him," Pharaoh joked, while impersonating Trump. Our #AMAs hosts @GiGiHadid and @JayPharoah are holding nothing back tonight. Let’s get this party started! pic. twitter.   —   AMAs (@AMAs) November 21, 2016,  While the impressions were mostly warmly received by the   audience, Twitter users skewered the stars, and particularly Hadid, for what at least one critic called a "disgusting display. " @TommyHilfiger @GiGiHadid Her imitation of Melania Trump was like a mean girl in high school. Disgraceful.  —   Lisa   (@lisaforsbergley) November 21, 2016,  Lost all respect for @GiGiHadid tonight!

SUCKS,  —   utgemini (@utgemini) November 21, 2016,  Hadid and Pharaoh weren’t the only performers to make political statements during Sunday night’s AMAs. While performing their latest song "Bang Bang," rock band Green Day broke out into a chant onstage, shouting "No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!" Singer Indina Menzel also took shot at   Trump while presenting an award alongside Dallas Mavericks owner and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban, who has also been critical of Trump. Menzel asked Cuban what’s the one thing he’s looking forward to next year. "Not being invited to the inauguration is a good start," Cuban said. "I know how you feel," Menzel responded. "Us unsafe, scary theater people won’t be invited to the inauguration either. I love you Hamilton!" the Frozen actress added, referring to the Broadway show’s cast’s recent lecture to Vice   Mike Pence.  Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson.
