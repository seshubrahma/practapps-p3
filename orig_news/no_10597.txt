Tuesday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump reacted to the news that his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was charged with misdemeanor battery in an incident involving former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields at a Jupiter, FL, campaign event on March 6.  Partial transcript as follows: TRUMP: Before she knew it, she was on tape. Take a look. You have to see it. You take a look at her initial statement sounded like she got thrown out of a building. You take a look at that and then  —   REPORTER: She did get bruises. TRUMP: I don’t know if there were bruises from that. Who said if they were bruises from that? How do you know bruises weren’t there? REPORTER: That’s what the police said. TRUMP: How do you not the bruises weren’t there before? She had a bruise on her arm. If you’re going to get squeezed wouldn’t you would have yelled out a scream if she had bruises on her arm? Take a look at her facial expression. Facial expression doesn’t even change. So you know you say bruises, how did they get there? Who put them there? I don’t know he put them there. I’m sticking up for a person. I’m not going to let a person’s life be destroyed over somebody we have on tape  —  take a look at what people are saying when they see that incident on tape. No jury, in my opinion, no jury would convict a man and destroy a man’s life over what you witnessed. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
