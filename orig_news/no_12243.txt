On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s "New Day," New York Times Presidential Campaign Correspondent and CNN Political Analyst Maggie Haberman stated that while "Trump rushed ahead" with birther conspiracy theories, "There were some supporters of Hillary Clinton who started the birther movement. Hillary Clinton never talked about it. "  Haberman said, "There were some supporters of Hillary Clinton who started the birther movement. Hillary Clinton never talked about it. There was some internal memo that leaked at one point, and then it never went anywhere. It was Trump definitely, this is not in dispute, who in 2011 put what had been a fringe movement at that point that most conservatives, to be clear, avoided talking about.   …     Trump rushed ahead with it. " She added, "But there is no reason to believe he has changed his opinion on that, other than Rudy Giuliani saying, oh, he’s changed. So I think that because Trump has said so many things that are so contradictory, or that have, you know, not matched up, or that have been not true, there is no reason to assume that, yes, this is accurate, and he has.
