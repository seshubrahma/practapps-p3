Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are looking for Super Tuesday sweeps as voters in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Delaware cast their votes today. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates.   —   All times eastern. 1:12: Mainstream media wowed by Trump’s dominant night. Trump carried every single county and congressional district that voted today. Wow.  —   Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) April 27, 2016,  12:58: On MSNBC, none other than Hugh Hewitt predicts that even if Trump gets really close to 1, 237 delegates, "you might still see  …     the Rules Committee enable the Republican Party to reject him. " He says "anything can happen. " 12:10: More good news for Trump: And right now, I see zero reason to assume that Trump can’t win a huge delegate take from California —  like 150 or more,  —   Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) April 27, 2016,  Trump could win enough unpledged delegates in Pennsylvania to obviate the need for a win Indiana,  —   Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) April 27, 2016,  11:55: Kasich campaign, RedState in denial: On this very strong night for Donald Trump, here’s a statement from the Kasich campaign’s @chrisschrimpf: pic. twitter.   —   Kailani Koenig (@kailanikm) April 27, 2016,  My latest  —  &gt Nothing that Happened Today Changed Anything | RedState https:  .   —   Leon Wolf (@LeonHWolf) April 27, 2016,  11:15: Incompetent #NeverTrump professional tacticians doing what they do best —  losing.

The tone of his voice lets you know that he, unlike folks like S. E. Cupp who have gotten nearly everything wrong this election cycle, knows how formidable Trump will be in a general election. Axelrod was the top strategist for a relatively "outsider" candidate who mobilized disaffected black voters in the 2008 Dem. primary against Clinton just like Trump can mobilize disaffected   white voters in 2016. 10:55: On CNN, Paul Begala says the incompetent "Stop Trump" movement turned into the "strengthen Trump" movement because voters are fed up with the GOP establishment and their professional tacticians. 10:53: Newt: If Trump gets nomination before convention, challenge for GOP establishment will be to "get over it. " . @newtgingrich, on if @realDonaldTrump has over 1237 before convention: "The challenge then for the GOP establishment is to get over it."  —   Fox News (@FoxNews) April 27, 2016,  10:45: CNN’s estimates number of delegates Trump will get: CNN estimate so far on delegates: Trump 99Kasich 5Cruz 0,  —   Teddy Schleifer (@teddyschleifer) April 27, 2016,  10:36: Clinton projected to win Connecticut, going   on the night. Clinton projected winner in Connecticut by NBC News. She has a 2 point lead, and there’s plenty of Clinton turf left.  —   Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) April 27, 2016,  10:34: Trump says the  only thing Hillary has going is the "women card" and women don’t like her. He says Clinton would not get 5% of the vote if she were a man. 10:26: Trump says the top security threat to the U. S. is always "nuclear" and the "power of weaponry. " He says we have to be "unbelievably careful" and then Trump says the biggest threat is not global warming. He says we cannot let Iran get a nuclear weapon, 10:25: Asked about what would be the biggest contrast with Clinton, Trump says there will be a lot of contrasts re: jobs and Wall Street. He says Clinton will get the nomination unless she gets indicted because of her email scandal and says Clinton is funded by Wall Street. He says what Clinton did was an "absolute criminal outrage. " Trump says maybe Sanders is not dropping   because Clinton may be indicted. He adds that she is "being protected by Democrats. " Trump says Clinton is a "flawed candidate" and will be easier to beat than his GOP primary opponents. 10:24: "We don’t have a ceiling," Trump says, adding that his ceiling may be 100%. Trump asks how someone hits 50% when there are 16 people in the race and says talk of a  "ceiling" was always unfair. Trump thinks he can win New York, 10:23: Trump says he will never change re: "Make America Great Again. " He says NATO needs to pay up and then says there won’t necessarily be a "Trump Doctrine" because you have to be flexible since circumstances can change year after year. He says you can’t say "this is my doctrine and I will not move. " 10:21: Trump says he thinks the GOP is now seeing him as the "presumptive nominee. " He says people who have said terrible things about him in the past now want to join his team. "Names you wouldn’t believe," he insists. "A lot of it will be coming out soon. " 10:18: Trump blasts "crooked Hillary" and says her husband signed NAFTA, which "destroyed our country. " He says Hillary knows "nothing about jobs except for jobs about herself" and will be "terrible" on economic development. He says Clinton was "sleeping" when she got the 3 a. m. phone call regarding Benghazi. Trump says Hillary doesn’t have the "strength" or the "stamina" to "deal with China or other things. " He says he will do far better for women than Clinton will ever do, which includes protecting our country. Trump cites Clinton’s Iraq vote and he mentions that Sanders said Clinton was not qualified to be president. Trump again says that Sanders should run as an independent. 10:15: "No, I am me," Trump says when asked if he is "playing a part. " Trump says "I’m not changing" and says he is going to "represent our country with dignity. " He mentions that he went to the best schools and says if an NFL team makes it to the Super Bowl, they don’t just change their quarterback. 10:14: Trump says Cruz is "wasting his time" vetting running mates. He said he thought Cruz was holding a news conference tonight to drop out. Trump says he will have a committee in the future to vet potential running mates. 10:12: Trump says PA delegates have a "moral obligation" to support him because he won by such a commanding margin. He says he is honored that he hit over 60% in virtually every race with three people in the race . 10:08: Trump now taking questions. "I consider myself the presumptive nominee," Trump says.  He says he "unifies people" and Messrs.   should get out of the race. 10:05: Trump well on his way to winning more than half of the nominating contests: The GOP nomination calendar comprised of 56 contests in states, DC  territories. Trump has now won 27 (1 shy of  )  —   Robert Yoon (@robyoon) April 27, 2016,  10:01: Trump wants to thank the media for covering him fairly for the last few hours and the few weeks. Trump says the best way to beat the system is to "have evenings like this. " Trump says when a boxer KOs the other boxer, you don’t have to wait around of the decision. He says he has millions more votes than Cruz and Kasich. Again, Trump is just rambling on about process instead of his vision for the country. Another wasted opportunity on a national stage when all eyes are on him. 10:00: Trump says he is going to go to Indiana. He is again rambling on about process instead of talking about his vision. He mentions that Bobby Knight is the "gold standard" for Indiana. He says Knight is "tough" and "smart" and "he wins. " 9:58: A victorious Trump takes the stage at Trump Tower. He speaks before the music cuts off. He says this is a "far bigger win than we expected. " 9:55: On CNN, David Axelrod says most of the professional Democrats fear Trump much more than Cruz (it’s because Cruz telegraphs all of his messages, attacks and would be easy to counterpunch. Trump is so unpredictable that professional and unimaginative tacticians who have trouble thinking on their feet will have trouble coming up with canned lines for Clinton to use against Trump). 9:25: Sanders wins Rhode Island, prevents Clinton from getting clean sweep like Trump. Fox News projects Bernie Sanders defeating Hillary Clinton in the Rhode Island Democratic primary,  —   Bret Baier (@BretBaier) April 27, 2016,  9:23: Clinton says we want America to be in the "future business" where we break down barriers instead of building walls. She wants to imagine a tomorrow where "love trumps hate. " 9:22: Clinton yells "deal me in" on playing the women’s card, echoing what she says in her standard stump speech while referencing Trump’s comments about Clinton’s use of the gender card. 9:15: Fox News’s Stirewalt, who had been vocally   says populists taking over GOP. Earlier on MSNBC, Nicolle Wallace said the voters are prevailing over the party’s establishment. . @ChrisStirewalt: "What’s happening inside the Republican Party right now is that the populists are taking over.

She also thanks the 42nd president of the United States, "my husband. " She says "with your help, we’re going to come back to Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention with the most votes and the most pledged delegates. And we will unify our party to win this election and build an America where we can all rise together. " She says her campaign is about restoring confidence in the ability to solve problems. She says Republicans would demonize "  Muslims" who we need in the fight against terror.

Trump goes 5 for 5 tonight.  —   Joshua Hoyos (@JoshuaHoyos) April 27, 2016,  8:26: Chuck Todd says that pundits for the longest time used to talk about Trump’s supposed "ceiling" and he may now get over 60% in multiple states tonight. Todd says we may look back at tonight and say it was "beginning the end" of the primary battle.  Todd says a Cruz operative told him that they would be able to hold Trump under 1, 000 delegates before the convention but notes that Trump can possibly reach 1, 000 tonight. Todd says if these numbers hold, Trump has a "clear" and not a "narrow" path to the nomination. 8:23: Trump projected to win Rhode Island.  BREAKING: @NBCNews projects Trump as the winner in the Rhode Island GOP primary https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) April 27, 2016,  8:08: In West Virginia, Sanders says a lot has happened in the last year.  Sanders says he will win in West Virginia and now national polls don’t show him 60 points down to Clinton like they did when he entered the race and the pundits declared that he was a "fringe candidate. " He says he is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump. He says independents should be allowed to vote in Dem. primaries. "Those folks and independents all over the country will be voting in November for the next president of the United States," he says. Sanders says he is generating this enthusiasm because he is telling the truth, which is something "very unusual in contemporary politics. " Sanders says we can’t sweep the hard realities of life under the rug and also chides the media for not dealing with, in most cases, the realities of our lives because they are owned by large corporations. If Sanders wins RI, it will be the third state  —   after OK and NH  —   that Hillary won in 2008 but lost this time. (MI is its own thing.)  —   daveweigel (@daveweigel) April 27, 2016,  8:03: According to CNN, Trump won white Evangelicals by nearly 30 points in Pennsylvania over Cruz (58% %) and they made up 42% of the GOP primary electorate.

And in Maryland, 61% of "very conservative" voters in Maryland supported Trump. Cruz got only 28% and these reportedly voters made up 28% of the vote. 8:02: Good point about Cruz’s failures in the SEC states. Got rolled over like he was an Alabama opponent in college football.

" He says Trump is likely to win some states and the media will be "excited over Donald Trump’s victories" and the media will say Trump is the Republican nominee. He says they are eager to crown Trump because the network executives are "ready for Hillary. " He says the campaign will move back to "more favorable terrain" in Indiana and Nebraska and North Dakota and Montana and Washington and California.

" He says Trump will be a stronger general election candidate than the pundits think. He says the campaign will get the 1, 237  and says people must have forgotten to inform Kasich that there was a   alliance. On Trump’s tone, Wiley says "Donald Trump the victor" is going to show up at Trump Tower tonight. He says the Trump campaign looks forward to a contest against Clinton in the fall and says her comments about Trump being out of touch with Americans are "rich" coming from Clinton. He cites Clinton’s "Scooby van" in Iowa. Regarding the reported acrimony between Manafort and Lewandowski, Wiley says it’s "much ado about nothing. " Wiley, who was Walker’s campaign manager, says we ran into a "buzzsaw" in Donald Trump. He says voters are looking for a true outsider and Trump is that "true outsider.

Just the thought of Trump appointing justices of the Supreme Court, who will have lifetime tenure and make decisions, for decades, that will determine whether we will still be a free people, should sober up all who have not been irretrievably hypnotized by rhetoric or so embittered by the betrayals of the Republican establishment that they can see little else, including life and death issues. 3:35: Trump’s children reportedly wooing uncommitted PA delegates: Ex: Ivanka  Eric Trump made personal calls to uncommitted delegates to make the personal connection.
