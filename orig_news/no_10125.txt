Sunday on CNN’s "Reliable Sources," host Brian Stelter said   Donald Trump "lies so casually, so cynically" that therefore, "His lies are different and deserves scrutiny. "  Stelter said, "Let’s tell some truths about lying. The way Donald Trump lies has people rethinking some of the basic premises of journalism, like the assumption that everything a president says is automatically news. When   Trump lies so casually, so cynically, the news isn’t so much the false thing he said, it’s that he felt he could go ahead and say it, go ahead and lie to you. " "That’s the story," he added. "Why does he bend and flex and twist and warp and distort the truth? Personally I’m curious because I think Trump does it differently than last presidents. His lies are different and deserves scrutiny. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
