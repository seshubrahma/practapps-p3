Rick Ross released the music video for his   song "Free Enterprise" this week, in which the   rapper fantasizes about the death of   Donald Trump. ["Assassinate Trump like I’m   accept these words as they came from Eminem," Ross raps, an apparent reference to George Zimmerman, who shot and killed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012.  "Free Enterprise" features vocals from singer John Legend and appeared on Ross’ 2015 studio album Black Market. "Democratic Party sentenced to the   them, I voted for André Benjamin," he raps in the video while standing in front of an upside down American flag. The word "Trump" was bleeped out of the official music video, released on YouTube on November 9  —   the day Trump became  .  In an attempt to clarify the controversial lyrics, Ross told Rolling Stone in January he "would never advocate violence on Trump or anyone. " "It’s lyrical assassination," he said. In December, Billboard reported that   had pulled the rapper’s album from store shelves over the Trump assassination lyric. A cursory search for the album on the retailer’s website reveals it can be purchased through   vendors. The   rapper is no stranger to controversial lyrics. In 2013, Ross came under heavy fire for his lyrics on Rocko’s song, "U. O. E. N. O. " "Put molly all in her   ain’t even know   took her home and I enjoyed   ain’t even know it," Ross raps, describing how he’d drug a woman before having sex with her. The lyrics were interpreted as a celebration of rape by women’s rights groups the subsequent blowback resulted in Ross losing his Reebok endorsement deal. Ross later took to Twitter and apologized to those who interpreted his lyric as promoting rape culture. A representative for Ross did not immediately respond to Breitbart News’s request for comment on this story.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson
