Welcome to Breitbart News’s daily live updates of the 2016 horse race. [It’s moving day today, especially for Republicans, as the South Carolina primary will reshuffle the GOP field (polls close at 7 pm EST). Democrats caucus in Nevada (doors open at 2 pm EST) in what is essentially a very early rubber match in the early series of nominating contests.    —   8:43: Sen. Ted Cruz aims at Donald Trump.

He’s a Hummer doing 90. weaving in and out of traffic. He is dominating all elements of the GOP demographic coalition not just those who are angry’: Donald Trump’s victory in the South Carolina primary demonstrated his strength among Republican voters of all stripes and even helped force Jeb Bush, once considered the likely frontrunner in the GOP presidential contest, to suspend his campaign —  a sign of how the real estate mogul has upended politics. Despite his   with Pope Francis, the state’s governor endorsing his rival and the appearance in the state of George W. Bush to help his brother, Trump won big in South Carolina. According to exit polls, he carried veterans and older voters, virtually tied Ted Cruz for the evangelical vote and dominated among voters with no college, some college and college degrees. He won moderates and conservatives. His only weaknesses were among   "very conservative" voters, the more affluent and voters with graduate degrees. None of this means that Trump is unstoppable. But he’s also won secular New Hampshire, where less than a quarter of the state’s Republican primary voters were evangelical. (In South Carolina, it’s 69 percent.) He came in second in the Iowa Caucuses. The southern states that dominate the March 1 and March 15 primary dates also seem like very fertile ground for the real estate mogul. "Let’s put this thing away," said a very competant Trump as he declared victory and looked forward to the upcoming contests. [  …    ] It’s become cliche in the presidential campaign to talk about candidates having different lanes —  an outsider lane, an establishmient lane, etc. But Trump has no lane. He’s a Hummer doing 90. weaving in and out of traffic. He is dominating all elements of the GOP demographic coalition not just those who are angry. At this point here is no certainty, as Washington insisders had once hoped, that as the field narrowed Trump would be stopped either because voters somehow came to their senses or because the party would coalesce around a less controversial alternative. But that seems less likely. The thinning field has actually strengthened Trump and while it’s possible that in a    race Cruz or Rubio could beat Trump but so far, with the exception of one outlier poll, the evidence suggests that Trump could beat them. 10:15: Kasich thinks it’s a   race: Kasich: once there were 8 governors running for President and now there is only one.  —   Heather Haddon (@heatherhaddon) February 21, 2016,  10:12: Eric Cantor, ladies and gentlemen: Proud to be a @JebBush supporter  …     he’s a great American.  —   Eric Cantor (@EricCantor) February 21, 2016,  10:10: Record turnout in South Carolina: Now more than 711, 000 votes counted with 97% in.

" Cruz thanks his South Carolina team. Cruz says "we are effectively tied for second place" [Tony Lee: decimal points matter —  ask Hillary Clinton after Iowa 2008] but the has defied expectations each time. He says the Washington Cartel is terrified that the conservative grassroots is rising up. Cruz asks for a moment of silence of Justice Antonin Scalia. He says "Washington power brokers" will not decide Scalia’s appointment. "It will be decided be We the People. " Cruz says he is the only campaign that has beaten and can beat Donald Trump.

He congratulates Messrs. Bush and Trump. He praises Jeb! as the "greatest governor in the history of Florida. " Rubio says the "children of the Reagan revolution are ready to assume the mantle of leadership. " He says they are ready to do for the next generation "what Ronald Reagan did to us. " Rubio talks about 21st century conservatism and and talks up Sen. Tim Scott’s story, Haley’s story, and his story. Rubio says conservatives will fight for single moms, fathers who work two jobs to give kids opportunities they never had, high school students who go to schools across towns to better their lots in life. "We will fight for you because we come from where you are now, we live the way you are living now," Rubio says. He says the race "practically speaking" is down to three men and asks people to join his campaign because he gives the GOP the best chance to unite the party and the country. Rubio says he will always remember South Carolina as the place of "new beginnings" and "fresh start. " [Rubio’s speech would have been a lot better had he won South Carolina like his advisers had predicted and with all of the major endorsements that he received. It seems like he is trying too hard to look like a "winner" and the speech seems like it would be better as a   act at the convention given that he hasn’t won a state yet.] 9:05: Trump: "let’s put this thing away. " 9:02: We love our military and "We love our police. They’re not being treated properly. " Trump says we are going to build our military so big, so powerful that "nobody is going to mess with us, folks. " Trump says we’ll get the equipment that the general needs and not want lawmakers in Congress who are controlled by special interests tell them that they need. Trump says he is   his campaign. Trump says we’re going to take care of our vets. Crowd chants "USA! USA! USA!" after Trump says his supporters make up an "incredible movement. " Trump says "Make America Great Again" is maybe the "greatest of all time. " [Tony Lee: Trump is getting better with his   speeches but it has to be better, tighter. For what it’s worth, though, this is only Trump’s third   speech ever. So it is a work in progress.] 9:00: Coulter fired up: TRUMP: "We’re going to do the wall.

The argument that 60% of voters are not for Trump also does not carry that much water  …     pundits never say, for instance, that 80% of the voters are against Rubio. It will be interesting to see if the    media on the right hold Rubio’s campaign to account for setting their    marker. Rubio didn’t get 2nd in New Hampshire. And he did not win South Carolina.   winners don’t appear on Wheaties boxes. 7:52: Matt Drudge: Bring On Trump v. Hillary: Clinton vs. Trump is the race America deserves.  EPIC. WILD. NASTY.

He says his campaign is up against a powerful Super PAC that receives money from Wall Street and special interests before Super Tuesday. He asks for small donations to help him combat Clinton’s Super PAC. 6:38: Bernie Sanders is taking the stage in Nevada. He mentions that he was 25 points behind five weeks ago and made progress. Sanders says Clinton ran an "aggressive" and "effective" campaign and he applauds the Clinton campaign for its efforts. Sanders says his campaign is about bringing more people into he political process and again blasts the corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining democracy. He will not let billionaires and Super PACs by elections. He says the American people are catching on that we have a "rigged economy. " He also slams the country’s broken criminal justice system. Wall Street executives whose illegal behavior destroys the economy do not get criminal records, Sanders says. His says "our job is to bring justice back to the criminal justice system. " 6:30: Brian Williams does his best to downplay Clinton’s health concerns. He says Clinton has been trying to suppress a cough all week and her unusual coughing fit was the subject of certain websites last week. 6:22: Clinton now speaks about "systemic racism" and reforming criminal   systems. Clinton always sounds like she is lecturing when speechifying before large crowd, as if she doesn’t realize how she sounds when she tries to compete with crowd noise. Clinton says she knows what young people are up against and says it has to be about "what we’re going to build together" and not just what we give to you. Clinton says she will propose new ways for more Americans to get involved in national service. Appealing directly to minority voters: Clinton says imagine a tomorrow where "no child grows up in the shadow of discrimination and under the specter of deportation. " [This was Clinton’s first "victory" speech without an asterisk and her husband seems just as —  if not more —  relieved than Clinton] 6:20: Taking a    shot at Sanders, Clinton says "we’re not a   country. " 6:16: An exuberant Hillary Clinton thanks Nevada supporters. She says she is "so thrilled" and "grateful" to all of her supporters. "This one’s for you," she says. She said her supporters turned out in every corner of the state. She said hotel and casino workers never wavered and "students with too much debt" and "small business owners who never go off the clock" all supported her. She says this is "your campaign" and it is a "campaign to break down every barrier that holds you back. " "We hear you, we see you, we’re incredibly grateful to you," Clinton says. Clinton says there is so much that is wrong in this country (but doesn’t mention much of what she is speaking about has occurred under Obama’s presidency). Clinton pivots to South Carolina and talks about "crumbling classrooms. " She talks about Flint’s "poison water" that residents were forced to drink because the governor wanted to save money. She says Americans have a right to be angry and talks about wanting to get secret, unaccountable money out of politics (Clinton always says this with a straight face). She says Wall Street should not be able to threaten Main Street after saying that the next Supreme Court Justice shouldn’t let corporations buy elections. 6:15: She was for it before she was against TPP, though: Union support key to Clinton’s huge win in Nevada. Her decision to reject Obama’s TPP trade deal definitely helped.  —   Bob Cusack (@BobCusack) February 20, 2016,  6:13: Bernie claims he has the wind at his back: Proud that we brought many working and young people into the political process.

What we’re hearing a lot of from the pundits is that Hillary is in for a long campaign. 4:42  —   From coin tosses to   Hillary Clinton cannot stop beating Bernie Sanders when luck takes the place of voters.
