On Sunday’s "Meet the Press" on NBC, Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel reminded viewers that nobody protested or filed lawsuits in 2011 when former President Barack Obama suspended Iraqi refugees from entering the United States for six months over terrorism fears, although President Donald Trump has received much criticism for temporarily suspending visas for "immigrants and  " from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran and Iraq.  "Look, this is also not unprecedented, by the way," Strassel said. "I mean, Barack Obama put a pause for six months on refugees coming from Iraq back in 2011. I don’t remember protestors and I don’t remember lawsuits. So I think the bigger question if this is a temporary pause, which is designed for us to improve and look at our vetting processes, and indeed temporary, I don’t necessarily think that’s an outrageous idea. But the bigger question should be implementation. Did you get it right from the start?" (  RCP Video) Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
