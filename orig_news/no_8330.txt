From The Hill Jessie Hellmann writes:  Conservative columnist George Will is calling on the GOP to keep Donald Trump out of the White House, even if he wins the nomination. "Donald Trump’s damage to the Republican party, although already extensive, has barely begun," Will wrote in a new Washington Post column Saturday. Will warns a Trump nomination would create "  carnage" that could end Republican control of the House. "At least half a dozen Republican senators seeking reelection and Senate aspirants can hope to win if the person at the top of the Republican ticket loses their state by, say, only four points, but not if he loses by 10," Will wrote, saying Trump would be the most unpopular nominee ever.
