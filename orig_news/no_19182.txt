’  ’ "   Donald Trump took to Twitter just before the start of Tuesday’s   vice presidential debate to take a jab at Bill Clinton over   recent comments the former president has made about the   Affordable Care Act. " ’   "Wow, did you just hear Bill Clinton’’s statement on how bad   Obamacare is," . "Hillary not happy. As I have   been saying, REPEAL AND REPLACE!" ’ " the   announced   his   support for President Barack Obama’s signature   healthcare law, praising it for getting millions of more people   insured and preventing insurance companies from denying   insurance to anyone with a preexisting medical condition. " ’   "All of that is really important," he said. ’ ’   "There is a big problem with it that needs to be fixed," he   continued. "That everybody knows admits it. If you’’re just above   a line to qualify for the Medicaid expansion, or just above the   line to qualify for the subsidies for workers, the likelihood is   your premiums have gone up, your coverage has gone down, and the   insurance companies have taken the power." ’ ’’ ’   He made similar comments at an event yesterday. ’ ’   Trump wasn’’t the only Republican to jump into the fray after   Clinton made his comments. House Speaker Paul Ryan  "going to have to agree with   Bill Clinton on this one. .." ’ ’ Obama himself admitted there were some fixable   problems with his signature legislation. ’ ’   "In my mind the [Affordable Care Act] has been a huge success,   but it’s got real problems," he said. "They’re eminently fixable   problems in terms of strengthening the marketplace, improving the   subsidies so more folks can get it, making sure everybody has   Medicaid who was qualified under the original legislation, doing   more on the cost containment. But you hit a point where if   Congress just is not willing to make any constructive   modifications and it’s all political football, then you’re   getting a suboptimal solution." ’
