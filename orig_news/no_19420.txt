’  ’ ’     Donald Trump on Sunday made good on his promise   to shake up Washington by selecting one of the most controversial   figures in recent memory to serve as his top political aide. ’ "   Steve Bannon, the    former CEO of Trump’s campaign,    as the future president’s chief strategist, a job   similar to the post formerly occupied by operatives like Karl   Rove and Valerie Jarrett. " ’   But unlike Rove and Jarrett, longtime party operatives with deep   political ties, Bannon hails from the   political sphere   that operated mostly on the fringe of mainstream political   discourse before Trump embraced the movement during his   presidential campaign. ’ ’   Since 2011, Bannon has helmed Breitbart News, the     website that eschewed traditional Republican Party orthodoxy for   antiestablishment   positions on issues such as   immigration and trade. Under Bannon’’s leadership, the site   frequently assailed Republicans using incendiary rhetoric,   labeling Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol a "renegade Jew" and   targeting Republicans like former House Speaker John Boehner. ’ "   The new chief strategist’s appointment quickly set off a  as many noted   Bannon’s apparent sympathies for ethnonationalist arguments and   rhetoric. " ’   Many critics  including Sen. Harry Reid’’s   spokesman, Adam Jentleson, pointed out that Bannon’’s     claimed in court that the new chief strategist "doesn’’t like   Jews" and allowed Breitbart to post   articles. ’ ’   "  Trump’’s choice of Steve Bannon as his top aide   signals that white supremacists will be represented at the   highest levels in Trump’’s White House," Jentleson said in a   statement. "It is easy to see why the KKK views Trump as their   champion when Trump appoints one of the foremost peddlers of     themes and rhetoric as his top aide." ’ "   The  and the  were among groups condemning Bannon’s   selection, criticizing his   commitment to providing   a platform for the conspiracy theories and racial stereotypes   about immigrants on which the   has predicated its   movement. " "   Bannon is in many ways a strange messenger to execute Trump’s   populist economic message. " ’   He has frequently attacked Republicans and Democrats alike,    with other   media figures about how to   oust House Speaker Paul Ryan for what Bannon perceived as   globalist views on trade and immigration. ’ ’   But the former Breitbart chief also holds a degree from Harvard   Business School, and he made much of his fortune as a banker at   Goldman Sachs and as a longtime entertainment producer with   Hollywood connections and stakes in shows like "Seinfeld." ’ "   Still, many of Breitbart’s former employees who worked with   Bannon pointed out that he had successfully brought his formerly   fringe nativist ideas into the mainstream and favored an   unforgiving    political style that appeals to   Trump’s aggressive sensibilities. " ’   Former Breitbart spokesman Kurt Bardella, who quit the site this   year, described the organization as "completely devoid of reality   and facts" and said the site speaks to Americans’’ "worst   divisions and worst fears." ’ ’   "Breitbart’’s gone from being the propaganda arm of the Trump   campaign to now being the propaganda arm of the federal   government," Bardella told CNN on Monday. "That should be very   concerning to all Americans." ’ ’   Bardella speculated that Bannon could use the power of the White   House to exact revenge on enemies. ’ ’   "Steve is a very aggressive,        never show any sign of weakness," Bardella said. "That’’s his   entire modus operandi." ’ ’  ’ ’   For its part, Breitbart frequently denies charges of racially and   ethnically tinged coverage, characterizing its work as populist. ’ ’   Matthew Boyle, the site’’s Washington political editor,  that his news   organization did not seek to inflame tensions but to "hold the   global permanent political class in contempt." ’ ’   "We are doing what journalists throughout said mainstream media   are supposed to do: Challenge the conventional wisdom, hold   politicians’’ feet to the fire, ask tough questions, report facts   that are in many cases inconvenient truths for career   politicians, and give a voice to the millions of people worldwide   who have had theirs taken away from them by world elites who   consider the ordinary person beneath them," Boyle said. ’
