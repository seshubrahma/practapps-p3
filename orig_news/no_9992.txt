Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson is being excluded from the presidential debate, even though he’s pulling 9 percent in many states, and even 13 percent in Colorado. [The exclusion was announced Friday afternoon by the privately run Commission on Presidential Debates, whose board includes many established Democratic and GOP players.  Green Party candidate Jill Stein was also excluded. The board had earlier said it would exclude candidates who did not get 15 percent support in polls. With the assistance of Dr. Newport, the Board determined that the polling averages called for in the third criterion are as follows: Hillary Clinton (43%) Donald Trump (40. 4%) Gary Johnson (8. 4%) and Jill Stein (3. 2%). Accordingly, Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, and Donald Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, qualify to participate   …     The criteria will be reapplied to all candidates in advance of the second and third presidential debates. The first debate will take place Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.
