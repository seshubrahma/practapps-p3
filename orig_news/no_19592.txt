While protecting   classified material, we have an obligation to inform the public   about recent cyberattacks that have cut to the heart of our free   society. Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across   the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent   incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter   and defend against further  . ’ ’   "This cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for   our country. We are committed to working in this bipartisan   manner, and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal   of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks   conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security." ’
