ET,  Hillary Clinton is calling off plans to visit California on Monday and Tuesday following her collapse at the   memorial. From the Associated Press: WHITE PLAINS, N. Y.  —   Hillary Clinton is calling off plans to visit the West Coast on Monday and Tuesday following a health episode at the   memorial. Clinton abruptly left the anniversary ceremony on Sunday morning and needed to be held up by three people before she appeared to stumble off a curb and was helped into a van. Several hours later, her campaign revealed she was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday and advised to rest. Her doctor said Sunday evening that Clinton had become overheated and dehydrated at the event in lower Manhattan. Dr. Lisa R. Bardack says Clinton is now ‘‘recovering nicely’’ at home. UPDATE 6:52 P. M. ET, No answers on whether Clinton will attend   fundraisers. To reiterate, she has no public rallies scheduled until Wednesday. Aides still unclear on whether Clinton will amend her schedule. She is slated to fly to SF tomorrow for a fundraiser, LA later that night.  —   Ruby Cramer (@rubycramer) September 11, 2016,  UPDATE 5:44 P. M.

ET, From Politico: "Clinton scare shakes up the race: Physical weakness caught on camera turns health conspiracy into a legitimate campaign concern. " Even as reporters waited for more details about the health scare, supporters  —   for the first time  —   were quietly pressuring a candidate who has been reluctant to share details about her health and personal life to become more transparent to avoid a   of doubt that could help an even less forthcoming Trump. "The Clintons have this notion that they only go as far as they need to" in terms of disclosure, said an ally close to the former president and current Democratic nominee. "They can’t afford to approach this that way. " UPDATE 5:00 P. M. ET, CNN’s MJ Lee says that the Clinton campaign has been silent for hours since its initial statement. She quotes a law enforcement official as stating she "appeared to faint. " UPDATE 4:03 P. M. ET, From Breitbart Tech: Twitter’s Trending section has not included any phrase regarding Hillary Clinton’s collapse outside New York City’s   memorial service Sunday morning, despite capturing the attention of reporters across the political spectrum and spawning multiple hashtags. UPDATE 3:31 P. M. ET, CNN’s Dylan Byers reports on the frustration from Clinton’s press pool that they were shut out of covering exactly what happened this morning: With less than sixty days until the election, neither Clinton nor Donald Trump has allowed for what’s known as a "protective pool," a rotating group of reporters that travel with a candidate in order to provide a    account of their activities. Without a protective pool, Clinton was able to leave the memorial site without reporters, travel to her daughter Chelsea Clinton’s apartment without reporters, and leave New York City for her home in Chappaqua, New York, without reporters. That left Clinton’s press pool scrambling to follow her around Manhattan and up to Chappaqua, always a step behind. UPDATE 3:10 P. M. ET, Vox’s Jeff Stein agrees that today’s events will lead to more pressure on Clinton and Trump to release their medical records. Calling this the "central debate" of the presidential election may be a step too far. But at the very least, it suggest [sic] we’ll hear increased calls for both Clinton and Trump to release their full medical records as November draws near. UPDATE 3:07 P. M. ET, David Usborne, Chief North America correspondent for The Independent, writes: "Hillary Clinton must reassure an uncertain nation that she is in good medical shape after   memorial scare. " We know where slipping and sliding and pretending nothing is awry gets you. The mess over the private email server you used while Secretary of State wouldn’t still be the number one preoccupation of your political enemies if only you hadn’t been so reluctant to admit your errors at the outset. It seemed awfully like you might be doing something similar when you emerged from your daughter’s apartment building at noon on Sunday and declared breezily that it was a "beautiful day in New York". Trying to distract the media from the issue at hand with comments about the weather won’t work. UPDATE 2:56 P. M. ET, Scott Adams: "Clinton just became unelectable. " If humans were rational creatures, the time and place of Clinton’s "overheating" wouldn’t matter at all. But when it comes to American psychology, there is no more powerful symbol of terrorism and fear than   . When a      withers  —   literally  —   in front of our most emotional reminder of an attack on the homeland, we feel unsafe. And safety is our first priority. Hillary Clinton just became unelectable. UPDATE 2:38 P. M. ET, The Huffington Post, keeping everything in perspective: UPDATE 2:23 P. M. ET, From Breitbart TV: Sunday on NBC’s "Meet The Press," while commenting on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton having to leave during the   memorial service, former NBC’s "Nightly News" anchor Tom Brokaw said of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, "I think that she should go to a hospital, see a neurologist, and get a clean report if it is available to her. " Full video here. UPDATE 2:16 P. M. ET, Drudge picks up on this tidbit from the New York Times: A campaign spokesman didn’t immediately respond to questions about whether Sunday’s incident was related to her medication or allergies. Amy Chozick,   on this report, penned a piece Tuesday that altered a quote from Clinton herself about taking a "load" of antihistamines, as she blamed allergies for her   coughing episode at a Cleveland campaign rally. UPDATE 2:02 P. M. ET, Dr. Raymond Pollak  —   who describes himself as a political independent, and is the father of Breitbart editor Joel B. Pollak  —   describes how he would diagnose a patient exhibiting symptoms like today’s fainting episode. Work up for a 68 year old female who faints includes a thorough    evaluation and going through the algorithm of:      (drugs, alcohol,   i. e. Cardiac arrhythmia, anemia, vasovagal     In the ER, the competent clinician would examine her thoroughly and run a series of blood tests, EKG, as well as a   of the skull. Overnight observation might be necessary depending on the clinical circumstances. At least, this is the protocol for the average citizen. Whether Mrs. Clinton will receive this kind of evaluation or be pandered to and receive the "usual" awful care of the rich and famous remains to be seen. At the very least, reassurance from a recognized and competent medical authority will be necessary to reassure the country that her health is no impediment to her candidacy for the highest office in the land.

ET, Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post: "Hillary Clinton’s health just became a real issue in the presidential campaign. " What [Nick Merrill’s] statement leaves out is that a) it came 90 minutes after Clinton left the ceremony b) reporters  —   or even a reporter  —   were not allowed to follow her and c) the temperature in New York City at the time of Clinton’s overheating was in the low 80s.

NEW YORK CITY  —   Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton reportedly fainted on the way to her van after she abruptly left the   memorial ceremony at Ground Zero of the attack on the 15th anniversary, having to be helped into her vehicle by a protective detail. Clinton, who was here and only about 20 feet away from Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump, was listening along with Trump to the reading of the names lost in the terror attacks on this tragic day 15 years ago. Trump appeared at the ceremony around 8:20 a. m. receiving applause when he arrived, while Clinton arrived shortly before the first bell rang at 8:46 a. m. which is a citywide moment of silence in observance of time the first plane struck the North Tower. Shortly before 9:37 a. m. —  the time marked for a moment of silence in observance of the flight that struck the Pentagon down just outside Washington, D. C. —  Clinton was seen leaving the ceremony with her press corps in tow. Clinton was leaving through a back entrance, quietly. Several reports have surfaced since Clinton abruptly left the   memorial ceremony that she had a medical emergency and fainted on the way to her car. Her U. S. Secret Service protective detail actually had to help carry her into her car, according to a Fox News report from Rick Leventhal.
