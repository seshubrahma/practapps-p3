Sunday on  CBS’s "Face the Nation," Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Reince Priebus said  Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will lose the election because, "She’s too risky for this country. "  When asked if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will win, Priebus said, "Yeah, he is going to win, and he’s going to win because I think people in this country have had enough and he’s the change agent. When it comes down to risk in this country, Hillary’s been tested and she’s failed. She’s the risky candidate. You look at Russia, the uranium deal giving them control of 20% of the world’s uranium. Her pocketing hundreds of thousands in speeches, Russian reset, Libya, you look at Iraq and the mess she left there. What I’m saying is she was tried and tested. She failed. She’s too risky for this country. That’s why she’s going to lose. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
