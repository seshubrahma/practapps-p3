President Barack Obama mocked presumptive nominee Donald Trump for appearing at his golf course in Scotland after the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union. [During a fundraiser in Seattle, Obama explained his trip to the Global Entrepreneur Summit in California with Mark Zuckerberg and met young people around the world who were starting their own businesses.  "Now, this of course was against the backdrop of Brexit, and the nominee of the presidency for the other party at a golf course," he said mockingly as the audience laughed. Obama dismissed Brexit as "a reaction to the world shrinking and interconnectedness. " Obama also condemned Republicans for blocking his agenda in Washington D. C. "Unfortunately, sometimes this gets reported as Washington not working," he said. "No, itâ€™s not Washington not working. It is a party that has decided that their approach to maintaining power is to make sure that Washington does not work, and to breed cynicism, and to discourage voting in pursuit of either protecting the status quo and the special interests that they represent, or in pursuit of an ideological fixation on small government for the sake of small government.
