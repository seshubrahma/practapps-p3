Fox’s primetime crime drama Lucifer went out of its way Monday night to condemn   Donald Trump. [Episode 8, "Trip to Stabby Town," sees Lucifer (Tom Ellis) in a session with his therapist Linda (Rachael Harris) who’s asking Satan a series of questions about hell and its occupants.  "How did you actually torture Hitler in Hell?" Linda asks. "I mean, is his cell next to Idi Amin’s? Or Mussolini’s? Or is there kind of a tyrant wing in Hell?" Lucifer, initially reluctant to reply, eventually indulges Linda. "So, we can, You know, talk about Caligula, Stalin, Trump. I mean, I know he’s not dead, but he’s definitely going," Lucifer says of Trump.  It’s hardly the first time Trump has been skewered in the plot line of a fictional TV show. In September, Comedy Central’s South Park kicked off its   20th season with an episode that revolved around   candidates Hillary Clinton and Trump, with the show branding both as "Turd Sandwich" and "Giant Douche," respectively.

And last month, NBC pulled a   episode of Law  Order: SVU, which, as Variety reports, featured a character that closely resembled the  . The episode has reportedly not yet been assigned a new air date. Lucifer, while establishing critical and commercial success, has not been without its share of controversy. A petition launched by the American Family Association urging FOX Network to cancel Lucifer has gathered over 135, 000 signatures since May 2015.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
