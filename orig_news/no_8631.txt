Real Time host Bill Maher took his fellow liberals to task in a   essay in The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday, questioning how any   progressive could protest apartheid in South Africa while ignoring the roughly 40 countries around the world who have implemented Sharia law. [In the essay, Maher said he "absolutely" does not support Donald Trump’s proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from the country, and asserted that "America has the best record of any country as far as assimilating Muslims. "  "American Muslims can leave the religion if they want, come out of the closet if they are gay, marry outside of their religion. If you’re a Muslim woman in America, you can choose to wear a headscarf or not. You can argue with your husband," Maher wrote, adding: But these are not privileges that the majority of the world’s Muslims have. Forty countries in the world have some version of Sharia law. I just don’t understand how liberals who fought the battle for civil rights in the ’60s, fought against apartheid in the ’80s, can then just simply ignore Sharia law in 40 countries. Apartheid was only in one. I am not   and never have been: I am   ideas. Killing cartoonists and apostates, these are terrible ideas and practices, and it would be lovely to think that they were confined only to terrorists. They unfortunately are not.
