Viewers of last night’s debate between the vice presidential candidates took to Twitter to savage Hillary Clinton’s running mate Tim Kaine after he was dominated by a measured and confident performance from Donald Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence. [Many viewers felt particularly irritated by Kaine’s propensity to interrupt, something which he did 70 times over the course of the debate:  Tim Kaine keeps interrupting and is coming off as an obnoxious, arrogant bully. #VPDebate,  —   Monica Crowley (@MonicaCrowley) October 5, 2016,  Tim Kaine will unite Americans by interrupting every last one of them.  —   jimgeraghty (@jimgeraghty) October 5, 2016,  Tim Kaine cannot stop interrupting. He is coming off extremely defensive, petty, and untrustworthy just like his running mate #VPDebate,  —   Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany) October 5, 2016,  Other viewers picked up on the fact Kaine seemed to be very nervous, which was evident in both his speech and his body language: Tim Kaine looked like Richard Nixon in the famous LOSS to JFK. He looked sweaty and nervous.  —   John (@NobamaDotCom) October 5, 2016,  Tim Kaine is losing it early. Can’t stop moving his hands. Anxious for sure.
