Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was on Stephen Colbert’s "Late Show" Wednesday, and the "Shark Tank" star participated in a roast of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.  "Donald, I’ve got a travel tip for you. When you’re going through customs and they ask if you’ve got anything to declare, try not to blurt out ‘bankruptcy,’" Cuban joked.
