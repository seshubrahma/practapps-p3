’  ’ ’   Still not sure why all the fuss  —   and  ‘s"  ’ ’   The first is "Hillary, Actually," a       parody of the famous cue card scene from "Love, Actually," with   the always dependable Cecily Strong in the Keira Knightley role   and McKinnon in the   Andrew Lincoln spot. The   gist, in case you didn’t see the movie:   shows up at   the front door of   to pledge love, but does so   silently, with cue cards. ’ ’   In the "" version, McKinnon is a      attempting   to woo Strong’s electoral college voter away from Donald Trump.   "But Bish," reads one card, followed by another’s "He Cray. " ’ ’   You get the drift, and Strong does too, expertly mimicking   Knightly’s every reaction and  . But it’s McKinnon who   lands the jokes without saying a word  —   check out the expression   after the "Cray"   —   and suggests something wistful beyond   the   potshots, maybe a caring and concern   that’s more Kate than Hillary. ’ ’   In the second sketch, "Christmas Miracle"  —   one of two   bits from Saturday night we might see in future "SNL"   holiday clip shows  —   McKinnon repeats her crude,      Colleen Rafferty, this time seated (with two others, played   by Strong and host Casey Affleck) before a theological panel   to answer questions about recent close encounters with Santa   Claus. ’ ’   The other two encounters are storybook: elves, magic dust, joy.   But Colleen’s doesn’t even involve Santa, but rather his helper,   a    goat man named Krinkle Mouse, his     wife and a pervy   creature with a vulgar name and odor   of eggs. ’ ’   There were a couple good jokes  —   "It wasn’t the worst time I’ve   had on all fours" and "Damn it Colleen, you’re becoming your   mother" (watch the clip for the  ) but the sketch works   solely because McKinnon occupies this instantly familiar   type like it’s a   Christmas sweatshirt. ’ ’ Take a look here, and see if you don’t agree: ’ ’     ’ ’    ’
