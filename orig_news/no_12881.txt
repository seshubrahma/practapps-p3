Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump posted on Twitter that President Obama should resign if he doesn’t acknowledge that the terror attack in Orlando, Florida, which killed at least 50 people and wounded more than 100, was due to "radial Islamic terrorism. "  Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn’t he should immediately resign in disgrace!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 12, 2016,  Omar Mateen, the shooter, was from Port St. Lucie, Florida, but was born in New York to parents of Afghan origin. He was Muslim.
