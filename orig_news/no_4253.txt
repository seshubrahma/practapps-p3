Nicole Kushner Meyer is apologizing for mentioning her brother, Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser and    to President Donald Trump, during an investment conference in China over the weekend. ["In 2008, my brother Jared Kushner joined the family company as CEO, and recently moved to Washington to join the administration," Meyer said at the conference aimed at encouraging Chinese developers to invest in a New Jersey real estate project, according to CNN.  On Monday, Kushner Companies said Meyer’s remarks were not meant to motivate investors to sign onto the real estate project. "Ms. Meyer wanted to make clear that her brother had stepped away from the company in January and has nothing to do with this project," the company said in a statement. Meyer never mentioned the president’s name during the investor event, but Trump’s photo was seen in a slide at the conference that detailed the "key decision makers" on the   program, CNN reports. Kushner Companies distanced itself from the photo Monday, insisting that the image "was part of a presentation by the event’s organizers. " "Kushner Companies had nothing to do with it," the company said. The   visa program encourages wealthy foreign nationals to make substantial investments in U.
