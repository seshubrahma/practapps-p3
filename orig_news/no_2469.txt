That banana you might be having for breakfast is probably a Cavendish, the most widely available variety of one of the world’s most popular fruits. But a deadly fungus is on the march, and the Cavendish’s lack of genetic diversity is raising fears of a possible "bananapocalypse. " The killer, a strain of Panama disease called Tropical Race 4, has spread to China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and the Northern Territory of Australia, and has recently been found in Africa and the Middle East. With its yellow peel and seedless fruit, the Cavendish makes up 95 percent of bananas sold worldwide, according to the U. N. Food and Agriculture Organization. The previous dominant variety, the Gros Michel, was devastated by another form of the fungus in the 1950s. Growers turned to the Cavendish, whose strength lies more in disease resistance than flavor. (One expert said it "had been considered something close to junk. ") The Cavendish is thought to have arrived in England in the 1800s from Mauritius, taking its name from the family in whose greenhouse it was cultivated. Missionaries eventually carried it to the Pacific islands. One scientist sees a silver lining in newly urgent efforts to save the seeds from wild bananas. "Race 4 is a threat," he says, "but it’s also an opportunity to start growing more diversity. " Remy Tumin contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.
