"He’s a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe. It’s one step forward and two steps back. We had Obama and now we have Donald Trump and Melania. It’s disgusting. " The protests in the Bay Area Wednesday morning echoed numerous similar events across the country after Trump defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in a highly contentious presidential election. Trump’s win came as a surprise to million across the country as Clinton was heavily favored by most polling ahead of Election Day. Thousands of New Yorkers took to the streets of Sixth Avenue in Manhattan Wednesday evening in protest, many of them chanting, "He is not our president" and other similar slogans. Similar demonstrations occurred in Boston, Los Angeles, Washington D. C. and San Francisco Wednesday. The progressive organization MoveOn had organized hundreds of   protests across the country in the hours after Tuesday’s historic vote. Schools in Los Angeles are taking additional steps to help those disappointed by the election outcome. The Los Angeles Unified School District, in which 74 percent of students are Latino, announced Wednesday that counseling would be available for students upset by Trump’s victory. "As students and staff arrive at school today, we know there may be feelings of fear and anxiety, especially within our most vulnerable communities," LAUSD Board President Steve Zimmer wrote the district’s families in a letter, according to the Sherman Oaks Patch. "The District is providing additional support to those who need it. "   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
