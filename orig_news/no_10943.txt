David Catanese writes at U. S. News  World Report: Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama says he is open to serving as Donald Trump’s running mate, describing it as a potential opportunity to work in a "historically positive administration. " The    Republican, currently in his fourth term, made the rare acknowledgement of interest in a higher office to U. S. News in an interview on Thursday, stressing that he has had no conversations with the Trump campaign about the vice presidency. "I would have no objection to serving in a Trump administration, but I’m not pushing for that. I’m not expecting it to happen, but I don’t want it being reported that I wouldn’t take and wouldn’t consider serving in a Trump administration because I think it could be a historically positive administration," Sessions says. Sessions, who became the first sitting U. S. senator to endorse Trump back in February, is the New York billionaire’s chief liaison on Capitol Hill. He speaks to Trump several times a week by phone, including on Thursday morning before Trump clinched the 1, 237 delegates officially needed to become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
