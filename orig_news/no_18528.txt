’  ’ ’   President Donald Trump suggested on Friday on that former FBI   Director James Comey lied under oath  on Thursday. ’ ’   In a press conference at the White House, Trump said he didn’’t   say he "hoped" Comey, whom Trump fired on May 9, would "let go"   of an investigation into former national security adviser Michael   Flynn. Comey has said Trump asked him in a private meeting in   February to end that probe. ’ ’   But Trump added that if he had made those comments, there would   be nothing wrong with it, "according to everybody that I read   today." ’ ’   Trump, speaking alongside Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in   the Rose Garden, also said he was "100%" willing to testify under   oath to dispute claims Comey made before the Senate committee. ’ ’   "I didn’’t say that," Trump said of Comey’’s assertion. "And   there’’d be nothing wrong with it if I did say that, according to   everybody that I read today, but I did not say that." ’ ’   Trump did not make clear what he had read. Earlier Friday, he      from Alan Dershowitz, a prominent lawyer and Harvard professor,   who said there was "no plausible case" for obstruction of justice   and that "we must distinguish crimes from" political "sins." ’ ’   Comey also said in his testimony that Trump asked for his   "loyalty" during a dinner in January, but Trump insisted this was   also untrue. ’ ’   "I hardly know the man," Trump said. "I’’m not going to say, ’’I   want you to pledge allegiance. ’’ Who would do that? Who would ask   a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it, I   hardly know the man. It doesn’’t make sense. No, I didn’’t say   that. And I didn’’t say the other." ’ ’   Trump added that he "would be glad" to tell Robert Mueller, the   special counsel who is overseeing the FBI’’s investigation into   Russia’’s election meddling and whether Trump’’s campaign played a   role, "exactly what I just told you," but under oath. ’ ’ ’ ’   Earlier Friday, Trump tweeted that Comey’’s testimony was a "total   and complete vindication" for him "despite so many false   statements and lies." ’ ’   He explained in the press conference why he felt vindicated by   the testimony: ’ ’   Trump also addressed whether any tapes of his conversations with   Comey existed. ’ ’   Trump’’s tweet in May that Comey had "better hope that there are   no ’’tapes’’" drove Comey to instruct a good friend, a Columbia   University law professor, to  of his conversations with the president to the media,   Comey said. He said he did this because felt the investigation   may have reached a point at which a special counsel needed to be   appointed. ’ ’   Trump and his outside attorney, Marc Kasowitz, have zeroed in on   this and lambasted Comey for ordering the "leaks." ’ ’   During his Thursday testimony, Comey said he hoped Trump would   produce the tapes if he had them. ’ ’   On Friday, Trump said on three occasions that the media would   soon know about whether tapes existed. ’ ’   "Well, I’’ll tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near   future," he said, later adding that he was "not hinting anything"   about whether there were any   conversations. ’ ’   "I will tell you about it over a fairly short period of time," he   said. "You’’re going to be very disappointed when you hear the   answer." ’ ’  ’ ’   Comey’’s testimony provided . Comey said he believed he was fired   "because of the Russia investigation," amplifying calls that   Trump obstructed justice. He also said he took Trump’’s comments   about the Flynn probe "as a direction." ’ ’   Comey said he kept memos on his conversations with Trump  —   but   hadn’’t with two previous presidents or other top Justice   Department officials  —   because he "was honestly concerned that he   might lie about the nature of our meeting." ’ ’   Comey also said Trump and his administration tried to "defame"   him by spreading "lies, plain and simple," about his firing. He   cited Trump’’s "shifting explanations," which he said included   Trump saying on TV "that he actually fired me because of the   Russia investigation." ’ ’   But Comey did not provide any proverbial smoking gun. ’ "   As FBI director, Comey oversaw the bureau’s investigation into   whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials to   interfere in the 2016 presidential election. " ’   Some top Democrats  —   including Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut,   Brian Schatz of Hawaii, and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland  —        to call for Trump to testify under oath before Trump brought it   up on Friday. ’ ’   "I called on him to do this yesterday,"    after Trump’’s press conference. "Now, let’’s make it happen.   Senate can send over the invite ASAP." ’ ’President Donald Trump suggested on Friday on. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
