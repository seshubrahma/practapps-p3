The House State Affairs Committee held a hearing on March 15 after holding the "emergency item" for almost a month. More than 600 people signed up to testify. Democrat organized witnesses who testified were overwhelmingly against the legislation. The committee approved the bill by a vote of   along partisan lines. The bill was placed on the emergency calendar for April 26 after being considered in Calendars on April 20. As reported by Breitbart Texas, the   version extracts the teeth of the bill by cutting the provisions that would strip state criminal justice grants to renegade cities and counties. It also removes civil liabilities from government officials who did not honor immigration detainers and released criminal aliens that later commit crimes. The House version bars law enforcement officers from asking a person about their immigration status unless they have been arrested. Texas Governor Greg Abbott listed addressing sanctuary cities as an emergency item during his 2017 State of the State Address before a joint session of the legislature in January. As reported by Breitbart Texas, he told the members of the Texas House and Senate, "Elected officials don’t get to pick and choose which laws they obey. " The Governor responded after SB 4 was passed in February by reiterating that message and stating, "As Governor, I will not tolerate sanctuary city policies that put the citizens of Texas at risk. " Apparently expressing his desire for the bill’s passage, Abbott tweeted to the Texas House on March 19, "It’s time to get this Sanctuary city bill passed  to my desk for signing. " It’s time to get this Sanctuary city bill passed  to my desk for signing. #txlege #tcot https:  .   —   Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) March 19, 2017,  The communications director for Texas Speaker of the House Joe Straus responded to a Breitbart Texas inquiry in December by stating, "Speaker Straus will work with fellow House Members, Governor Abbott, and law enforcement to ensure that there are no sanctuary cities in Texas.
