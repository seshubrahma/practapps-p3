.@realDonaldTrump: Hillary isn’t ahead "because she’s terrible" pic. twitter.  In an appearance on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends" on Thursday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was asked to react to his opponent Democratic presidential nominee not understanding why she isn’t "ahead by 50 points. "  According to Trump, the answer is simple: "Because she is terrible. " "Because she’s terrible," Trump replied. "I mean, she’s had a terrible record. Everything she touches is bad. You look at what’s going on with Libya and you look at the surge and you look at all of her decisions and you look at the Iran deal, which is one of the dumbest deals I’ve ever seen, which she started, and she totally backs, by the way, I mean, in its completed form, she totally backs. You look at everything she touched, I mean, it’s just a mess. And she’s spending a lot of money and so far it’s not had much of an impact because I guess I’m winning in most of these states and we’ll see what happens in the end, but she is.
