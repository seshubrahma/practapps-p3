Friday during her remarks to at Planned Parenthood, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump "does not see all Americans as Americans. "  Clinton said, "Everything I heard from Donald Trump often seems to echo other leaders who have a very different view of women. The late, great Maya Angelou said when someone shows you who they are  believe them the first time. Donald Trump has shown us who he is and we sure should believe him. And it’s not just on reproductive rights. Donald Trump would take us in the wrong direction on so many issues we care about, economic justice, workers rights, civil rights, human rights. the environment. All of that is on the line in this election. " "When Donald Trump says a distinguished judge born in Indiana can’t do his job because of his Mexican heritage or mocks a reporter with disabilities or denigrates Muslims and immigrants, it goes against everything we stand for," she continued. "He does not see all Americans as Americans. So this election, is it about the same old fight between Democrats and Republicans, they will be there, don’t worry. But this election is profoundly different. It is about who we are as a nation. It’s about millions of Americans coming together to say we are better than this .
