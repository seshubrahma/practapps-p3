Donald Trump has won the fourth contest of Super Tuesday, taking Louisiana by a sizeable margin. With 16 percent of the vote counted, Trump has 45 percent support, a large victory over Ted Cruz’s 30 percent. [Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is a distant third with 15 percent of the vote. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has endorsed Rubio for the Republican nomination and campaigned for him in the Pelican State.  Rubio’s third place showing in Louisiana is a big disappointment for his campaign. Under current election results, Rubio will fail to meet the 20 percent support level required to win any delegates. Rubio also failed to win any delegates in Maine, where he finished fourth. Rubio is running a distant third in Kentucky and finished a distant third in Kansas. Louisiana is Rubio’s best showing of the night, no doubt due to Jindal’s endorsement. That said, it will still leave him out of the delegate count for the evening. Ted Cruz won Kansas and Maine on Super Saturday. The contest in Kentucky is still too close to call. The evening, though, looks like a split decision between Trump and Cruz. The Super Saturday results will allow Trump to maintain that he is still the frontrunner for the GOP nomination. Cruz will have a powerful argument that he is the only candidate who can still challenge Trump for the nomination. The stakes on Rubio and Ohio Governor John Kasich to win their home states on March 15th were raised even higher on Saturday.
