GOP frontrunner Donald Trump said the top three functions of the United States government are security, healthcare, and education. [During CNN’s town hall in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Tuesday night, an audience member asked Trump, "What are the top three functions of the United States government?"  "Security for our nation," Trump responded. "I would also say healthcare  …     [and] education. " "The top three are security, security, security," Trump stressed, saying America needs security "so we can continue to exist as a country. " "Thousands and thousands of people are infiltrating our country," the real estate mogul explained. "We don’t know who they are. " On top of security, Trump added, "Healthcare, education would be probably three that would be top. " "Our military has been eaten away," Trump explained. He also added that "Housing [and] providing great neighborhoods" is a function of the government. CNN’s Anderson Cooper followed up by asking Trump if he thinks education should be left to the federal government or to the states. "No, I want it to go to states absolutely," Trump clarified. He said the concept of the government is that there must be education within the country, but that he wants to get rid of Common Core. "We need healthcare for our people," Trump also clarified. "The government can lead it, but it should be privately done. " "We have to have private health care," the billionaire added. "We don’t have competition. "
