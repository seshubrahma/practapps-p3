’  ’ ’     Donald Trump on Thursday announced his senior   communications team, naming Sean Spicer, chief strategist for the   Republican National Committee, his first White House press   secretary. ’ "   Trump’s selection of Spicer, which was widely expected, came amid   several other key communications appointments. " "   The   named Hope Hicks, who has been Trump’s   spokesperson since the start of his presidential bid, White House   director of strategic communications. " "   Jason Miller, who served as the Trump campaign’s director of   communications, was named White House director of communications. " "   And Dan Scavino, who operated Trump’s social media accounts   throughout the campaign and grew a large fan following for his   brash online manner, was named White House director of social   media. " ’’ ’   "Sean, Hope, Jason, and Dan have been key members of my team   during the campaign and transition," Trump said in a statement.   "I am excited they will be leading the team that will communicate   my agenda that will Make America Great Again." ’ ’   Noticeably absent was Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle,  to be a "    candidate" making a push for White House press secretary  —   though   it was always unlikely she would displace Spicer. ’ ’   Spicer, for his part,  that being named press   secretary was an "amazing honor." ’
