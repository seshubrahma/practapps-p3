’  ’ "   WASHINGTON (AP)  —   A federal inspector general has launched an   inquiry into the Trump administration’s decision to pull   advertising for HealthCare. gov in the closing stretch of this   year’s   season, according to a letter made public Friday. " ’   The unexpected ad pullback soon after President Donald Trump took   office was termed "sabotage" by Democrats and former Obama   officials. The new administration said the ads were a waste of   taxpayer dollars. ’ ’   In a letter to Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington and     of Massachusetts,   the Health and Human Services Department’’s inspector general’’s   office said it has begun a "  review." ’ "   Investigators will look at the Trump administration’s actions to   stop paid advertising and temporarily suspend other outreach.   They’ll also review the effect on enrollment, the letter said. " "   Former Obama officials were outraged by the new administration’s   actions a few days before the Jan. 31 close of open enrollment.   They said there’s usually a surge at the end   season, and   the ad pullback discouraged prospective customers. Murray and    asked the inspector general to investigate. " ’’ ’   About 12. 2 million people have signed up for coverage this year   through HealthCare. gov and state insurance markets, short of   earlier Obama administration projections. ’ ’   In a statement, Murray said HHS has "a duty to provide the public   with accurate and timely information so that they can make   decisions about their health care." ’ ’   There was no initial response from the Trump administration. ’ ’WASHINGTON (AP)  —   A federal inspector. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
