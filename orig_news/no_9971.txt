Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton pledged that she’ll continue to request presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump release his tax returns. ["We’re going to keep asking to see Donald Trump’s tax returns," Clinton stated while campaigning with President Obama in North Carolina on Tuesday.  It’s wrong that some millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries, and we’re going to stop it.  —   Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 5, 2016,  Clinton has previously knocked Trump over his tax returns while on the campaign trail. "What about his taxes? We will get around to that too. Because when you run for president, especially when you become the nominee that is kind of expected," Clinton stated in May. "My husband and I have released 33 years of tax returns, we’ve got eight years on our website right now. So you have got to ask yourself, ‘why does he not release them? ’" Trump has said he isn’t revealing his tax returns because he is under an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
