Enigmatic pop icon Cher took to Twitter Monday to rip presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump  —   as she has done repeatedly in the past  —   by suggesting that terrorists around the world would be emboldened under a Trump administration. [THERES1. 6 BILLION MUSLIMS IN THE 🌎‼️SOME LIKE US, SOME HATE US, BUT THEY "ALL HATE" 🚽TRUMP‼️IF UR SCARED OF TERRORISTS NOW, WAIT 4PRES 🚽TRUMP💣💥  —   Cher (@cher) June 14, 2016,   "THERES 1. 6 BILLION MUSLIMS IN THE [WORLD]," the    "Believe" singer wrote, deftly blending her signature    text with globe, toilet and bomb emojis. "SOME LIKE US, SOME HATE US, BUT THEY ‘ALL HATE’ TRUMP!! IF UR SCARED OF TERRORISTS NOW, WAIT 4PRES TRUMP," she added. The singer continued her recent practice of adding a toilet emoji to every instance of Trump’s name. Most of Cher’s tweeting these days appears to center on Trump, whom she apparently despises despite calling him a "giant" among his Republican rivals last October. (For comparison, the singer called Ted Cruz a "creature from the nether regions" a couple of years ago.) "TRUMPS LIPS MOVE=LIES," the singer tweeted in a separate message on Monday, adding the obligatory toilet emoji. 🚽TRUMPS LIPS MOVE=LIES "LET EVERY1 HAVE NUKES""LET WORLD FIGHT ITS OWN BATTLES"GO  KILL ALL OF ISIS CHILDREN",NO, NEVER SAID THOSE THINGS,  —   Cher (@cher) June 14, 2016,  Monday was a particularly busy day on Twitter for the   as she repeatedly hammered Trump in her distinctive style.

But mostly, she’s just tweeting about Trump.
