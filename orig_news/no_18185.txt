’  ’ ’   A conspiracy alleging a chemical weapons attack carried out in   northwestern Syria last week was a "false flag" operation   orchestrated by "terrorists" opposed to Syrian   President Bashar   quickly made its way from a     propaganda outlet to leading members of the     media in the US. ’ ’   The trail leading directly from   News to     entities like the   site   InfoWars  ’ ’    ’ ’   The Syrian government has denied dropping chemical weapons on   civilians in Idlib province early last week.
