[New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, and a handful of Maryland jurisdictions allow   to participate in some types of local or school elections.

Arkansas finally closing the door on   voting in 1926. The Bloomberg article largely ignores the practical impact on Americans of voting by large blocs of illegals in favor of focus on the interests of illegals.

Discoveries of   on voter rolls is "accidental," he adds:  Though the Department of Justice has no procedures in place for a systematic investigation of these types of criminal violations, in just a   period, it prosecuted and convicted more than a dozen   who registered and voted in federal elections in Alaska, Florida, the District of Columbia, and Colorado. Among them was an alien in southern Florida, Rafael Velasquez, who not only voted, but even ran for the state legislature.
