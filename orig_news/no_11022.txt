UPDATE: A number of news sources are reporting that Governor Palin has officially endorsed Donald Trump.  Writing at her Patheos Blog, Bristol Palin, daughter of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, lashed out at Ted Cruz Tuesday and expressed her hope that her mother would endorse Donald Trump. The post is titled, "Is THIS Why People Don’t Like Cruz? ," and criticizes the Texas Senator for comments made by his campaign spokesman Ricky Tyler Tuesday morning. Appearing on CNN’s "New Day," Tyler said that if Palin endorses Trump as rumored, it would not be a blow to Cruz’s campaign but a blow to Governor Palin: "I think it [would] be a blow to Sarah Palin, because Sarah Palin has been a champion for the conservative cause, and if she was going to endorse Donald Trump, sadly, she would be endorsing someone who’s held progressive views all their life on the sanctity of life, on marriage, on   abortion," Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said on CNN’s "New Day. " Bristol Palin responded directly to Cruz: "I would not be in the U. S. Senate today if it were not for Governor Palin," you’ve said before. After hearing what Cruz is now saying about my mom, in a negative   reaction, makes me hope my mom does endorse Trump. Cruz’s   turning against my mom who’s done nothing but support and help him when others sure didn’t, shows he’s a typical politician.  How rude to that he’s setting up a false narrative about her! Less than two hours after Palin’s blog post exploded on Twitter, Cruz himself tweeted out, " I love @SarahPalinUSA  Without her support, I wouldn’t be in the Senate. Regardless of what she does in 2016, I will always be a big fan. "  —   I love @SarahPalinUSA Without her support, I wouldn’t be in the Senate. Regardless of what she does in 2016, I will always be a big fan.  —   Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 19, 2016,   —     Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
