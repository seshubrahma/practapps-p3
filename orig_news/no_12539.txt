On January 3 Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump used a Facebook post to call out Hillary Clinton’s hypocrisy in telling the American people that guns "don’t keep you safe" while simultaneously surrounding herself with "heavily armed bodyguards. "[On December 19 Breitbart News reported that Clinton reacted to the surge in gun sales that followed the San Bernardino terror attack by saying, "Guns, in and of themselves  …    will not make Americans safer.
