The mystery of Hillary Clinton,   missing on election night, appears solved. [A Tuesday of catharsis for Donald Trump voters turned into an evening of rage for Hillary Clinton. The Democratic presidential nominee, anticipating the postelection reaction of many of her supporters, began shouting profanities, banging tables, and turning objects not nailed down into projectiles.  "Sources have told The American Spectator that on Tuesday night, after Hillary realized she had lost, she went into a rage," R. Emmett Tyrrell reports. "Secret Service officers told at least one source that she began yelling, screaming obscenities, and pounding furniture. She picked up objects and threw them at attendants and staff. She was in an uncontrollable rage. " The appearance of campaign chairman John Podesta at Manhattan’s Javitz Center, and the dematerialization of his heretofore ubiquitous charge, perplexed in the first hours of Wednesday. "They’re still counting votes, and every vote should count," Podesta declared to a sad and stunned hall. "Several states are too close to call, so we’re not going to have anything more to say tonight. " As Podesta recalcitrantly refused to recognize reality early Wednesday morning, Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump to offer congratulations. The juxtaposition of the campaign chairman publicly vowing to fight around the time the candidate privately conceded the election left observers scratching their heads. Tyrrell’s reporting indicates that Mrs. Clinton’s mental state made it impossible for her to address her supporters on election night as custom requests. So, instead, Podesta gave a   speech on a   night to cover for the absence of the first woman president, her fireworks, and her victory speech   to the mothers of the Black Lives Matter martyrs. "She is not done yet," Podesta claimed. Tyrrell’s reporting indicates that, indeed, Clinton remained far from done. "Her aides could not allow her to come out in public," he writes. "It would take her hours to calm down. So Podesta went out and gave his aimless speech. I wish we could report on Bill’s whereabouts but we cannot. " Bill appeared the following day at Hillary’s belated concession speech wearing a purple tie but, thankfully, no purple marks about his face, suggesting experience dictated avoidance the previous evening. "People say they’re amazed Bill’s marriage survived," Tyrrell noted to Breitbart. "I’m amazed Bill survived his marriage. " Tyrrell’s reporting remains a thorn in the side of the Clintons more than two decades after the American Spectator published its Troopergate stories detailing Bill Clinton’s escapades as told by his Arkansas security detail, stories that first referenced Paula Jones and pushed the president on the road to impeachment. Nearly 19 years after Hillary Clinton imagined a "vast,   conspiracy" out to get her husband, the cabal’s charter member again relies on the accounts of the Clintons’   security to unmask the public faces worn by the power couple now out of power. "In the ’90s, we published several pieces that documented her throwing lamps and books," Tyrrell tells Breitbart. "This happened pretty often. She has such a foul mouth that the Arkansas state troopers learned a thing or two from her. She has a foul mouth and a good throwing arm. "
