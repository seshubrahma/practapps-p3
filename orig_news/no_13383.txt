In appearance on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends" from Cannes, France on the heels of the premiere of his Citizens United documentary "Torchbearer," "Duck Dynasty" patriarch Phil Robertson discussed the 2016 presidential election, which finds the   supporter now solidly behind presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.  On Trump’s candidacy, Robertson acknowledged that the people have spoken and he pledged to do everything he could to help him. "I was forced on to the Trump train, but I am happily volunteering my services for Mr. Trump mainly because the Republican Party has spoken," he said. "The people have said, ‘We want Mr. Trump.’ So, Mr. Cruz goes down. I love him, but now I’m on the Trump train and I’ll do everything I can to help him. Hey, we have to be loyal to the party. " Robertson went on to volunteer his services as a spiritual adviser for Trump. "I’ll make a valiant attempt behind the scenes, you understand, to sit down with Donald with a Bible in between us and I might can help him along with concepts like loving your enemies, loving your God, loving your neighbor" Robertson said. "Even your enemies  —   forgive them and move on. I may can help him in that area. And I can see it now  —   Trump wins, and the camera is panning and his spiritual adviser is me.
