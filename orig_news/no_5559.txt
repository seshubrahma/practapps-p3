Daughter of Frank Sinatra, Nancy Sinatra, accused CNN of deliberately twisting a comment she made in reference to President Trump, before congratulating the 45th President of the United States on his inauguration. [Responding to an article published by CNN originally entitled, "Nancy Sinatra not happy Trump using fatherâ€™s song at inauguration," the    singer and actress replied, "Thatâ€™s not true. I never said that. Why do you lie, CNN?"   CNNâ€™s story was based on a tweet from Sinatra that has since been deleted that said, "Just remember the first line of the song," in reference to the planned use of Frank Sinatraâ€™s "My Way" for Donald and Melania Trumpâ€™s first dance at the Liberty Ball on Inauguration Day. CNN has since amended the story, changing the headline to "Sinatra on Trump picking â€˜My Wayâ€™: Remember the first line," and adding a note that "This story has been updated to reflect Sinatraâ€™s reaction. " Sinatra appears to have deleted the tweet accusing CNN of lying after they updated their storyâ€™s headline and text. She also congratulated the 45th president, tweeting, "Good luck to you. " Congratulations, Mr. President. Good luck to you. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸  â€”   Nancy Sinatra (@NancySinatra) January 20, 2017,  Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
