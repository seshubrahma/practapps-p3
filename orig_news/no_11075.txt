SANTA MONICA, California  —   Former Mexican president Vicente Fox described the Obama administration’s Fast and Furious Operation as a "complicated issue between Mexico and the United States" during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Wednesday. [When asked if Fox thought Mexico deserved an apology from the United States for guns ending up in the hands of drug cartels in Mexico, he said, "Yes, that was a very complicated issue. "  "There is always in every process or any problem or an idea, light and shadows. And yes, that was a very complicated issue between Mexico and United States," Fox said. "It happens every day on the border, that border shared. " Then Fox turned the conversation into criticizing Donald Trump’s statements about the crime and need for a wall across the southern border. It maybe would be a good idea for Donald Trump and see the border and see the wall and see the bridges and see the activity and see the million people crossing that water everyday. Americans go to Mexico, Mexicans come to United States every day, one million. Every day hundreds of thousands of containers of car loads, of trains cross the border. How can he treat Mexicans with the disrespectful comment that he made. It’s very important that he comes.
