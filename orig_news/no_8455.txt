Welcome to Breitbart News’s live updates of the 2016 horse race.  All times eastern.  —   Cry me a river. Failed 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney was reportedly in tears when he told attendees of his Summit, which has been described as a "safe space" for the "Never Trump" smart set, that seeing Trump as the Republican nomination was breaking his heart. One wonders if Romney is really sad that Trump’s candidacy has resonated with working Americans more than his inflexible and robotic campaign ever did. Romney also reportedly ripped Ted Cruz and John Kasich for not taking on Trump harsh enough from the outset. But where was "tough guy" Romney when Trump was rising in the polls? He, like most of the GOP Smart Set who have never been in touch with the party’s voters, probably thought Trump’s candidacy would fade away.  —   9:45: Trump calls Warren "racist" for claiming to be a "Native American" to advance her career.
