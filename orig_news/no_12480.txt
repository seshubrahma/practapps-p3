[Unbelievable. https:  .   —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2016,   "These FBI documents provide undeniable proof that Hillary Clinton colluded with the FBI, DOJ and State Department to cover up criminal activity at the highest levels," alleges Trump adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn in a press release on Monday, adding: Hillary Clinton has recklessly put our national security at extreme risk.
