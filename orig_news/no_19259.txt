" ’   "I met her once & she casually said ’’I’’ve never seen a   mulatto    but I’’d like to! ’’" Peretti alleged in a tweet. ’ ’   Trump called that out in a statement Wednesday afternoon: "I am   not sure if that was meant to be a joke, but in case there is any   ambiguity, this is a complete and total lie," Trump said. ’ ’   Peretti’’s tweet sent Twitter ablaze. BuzzFeed    Ben   Smith even tweeted, "Is there a doctor on this flight @united,"   seemingly in response to Peretti’’s comments. ’ ’   When Peretti landed, he told BuzzFeed News a bit more about the   encounter, which allegedly happened about a decade ago at a   Manhattan bar in front of about five other people. ’ ’’ ’   "She was saying how she first said she had never seen an   uncircumcised    and then she said, ‘I’ve never seen a mulatto     .
