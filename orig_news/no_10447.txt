Donald Trump is campaigning against the "dishonest and totally biased" media, asking supporters to fill out a survey about how they think the press has been covering Trump’s campaign. ["It’s time to hold the media accountable for trying to rig this election against us," Trump’s email, which was sent out Monday morning, reads. "Please take the Mainstream Media Accountability Survey right now and help me spread the truth about our movement. "  The email continues: All too often I’m asked about a "poll" put out by a liberal organization that says the American people disagree with our   reforms to fix our country. Well  …    with your help today, the next time I’m being interviewed, I will have my own poll that shows that the American people disagree with the dishonest media! The   survey asks Trump’s supporters what media outlets they rely on and what political issues they think have been distorted by mainstream media coverage. On Sunday, Trump, who has repeatedly railed against the media throughout his campaign, took to Twitter to again express his distrust of the media in a series of Tweets: If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn’t put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016,  My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016,  Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016,  I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016,  It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016,  I have always been the same   true to self. The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!  —   Donald J.
