Actress Susan Sarandon railed against the Democratic National Committee Thursday, calling the party’s primary system "crazy" and "completely corrupt. "["After my experience in the primary, it’s very clear to me the DNC is gone," Sarandon said during an interview on CNN.  "It’s completely corrupt and every superdelegate is a lobbyist.

Sarandon ultimately endorsed Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein in a letter Wednesday, writing that "fear of Donald Trump is not enough for me to support Clinton, with her record of corruption.
