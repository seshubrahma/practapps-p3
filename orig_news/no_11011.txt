On "Fox News Sunday," Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) said his rival Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is attacking his wife Heidi Cruz, because he is "scared. "  Cruz said, "Sadly, what Donald has done, when he gets scared, listen, particularly on foreign policy, Donald doesn’t know. He doesn’t understand these issues. One of the reasons he was so scared this week is this past week Donald called publicly for effectively withdrawing America from NATO. Now that is a catastrophically foolish proposition. Abandoning Europe, withdrawing from the most successful military alliance of modern times makes no sense at all. If Donald were president, he actually did what he said he would do, withdraw from NATO. It would hand a massive victory to Putin, a massive victory to ISIS. ISIS would be dancing in the street at the weakness and isolation of Donald Trump. " "Now the day after he calls for withdrawing from NATO, this Brussels terror attack occurs. Brussels, is of course, where NATO is head quartered," he continued. "So his lack of understanding on foreign policy, his lack of ability and readiness to protect his country was evident. So Donald did what he always he tried to find a way to change the subject. He hasn’t campaigned for a week. He’s been hiding in Trump Tower. late at night he sends tweets attacking my wife, attacking Heidi. It is inappropriate, wrong and disgusting to see a candidate attacking the spouse of another. And it is a sign of just how scared Donald is right now because he doesn’t want to discuss the substance. That’s why he’s afraid to debate, why he refuses to debate because when he debates, his lack of understanding of the challenge of facing America becomes evident for everyone to see.
