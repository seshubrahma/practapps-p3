The attack "crossed a lot of lines for me," he said, as he met with King Abdullah II of Jordan. Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the U. N. blamed Russia for blocking a Security Council resolution that would have condemned the attack and warned that the U. S. might take unilateral action. We examined some of the atrocities the Syrian president, Bashar   has perpetrated against his people. And "The Daily" podcast tracks the course of the Syrian conflict and the choices Mr. Trump faces. _____ • Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, are headed to Florida today for a   summit meeting.

"You have a whole generation of politicians here who do not know how to talk to religious people," he said. _____ • And what’s to be done if nothing is working to slow down global warming? It’s time to think science fiction, a group of experts suggests. Geoengineering provides methods to offset climate change by applying scientific fixes  —   like cooling the planet by shooting aerosols into the stratosphere or whitening clouds to reflect sunlight  —   rather than changing old habits. _____ • Pepsi apologized and pulled an ad that borrowed imagery from the Black Lives Matter movement. • Just a "breath away.

The first modern Olympic Games started in Athens on this day in 1896. The revival of what was banned as a pagan festival in the fourth century is largely attributed to Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a French aristocrat. The first Olympics featured nine sports across 43 events, and produced some charming stories. Robert Garrett, an American, had never seen a discus. To practice, he had a blacksmith forge  —   based on classical accounts  —   "a   discus that weighed 30 pounds and was impossible to throw any distance. " When he arrived in Athens, he learned that a discus was only about eight inches across and weighed less than five pounds. After nearly injuring spectators on his first throws, he won the gold. (Although in the 1896 Olympics,   medals were made of silver.)

The 1900 Olympics included firefighting and  . In 1912, contests included painting and architecture.
