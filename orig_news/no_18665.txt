’’ "Fresh off strong    performances on the 2016 presidential primary’s biggest night, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are pivoting to focus on a   matchup that is beginning to look more and more likely." ’Both candidates won several primary and caucus contests Tuesday. Clinton has long been the presumed Democratic nominee for president, and Trump is the clear Republican frontrunner.’ ’A little after midnight EST on Wednesday, both candidates had won seven states.’ ’Clinton won Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Trump won Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont, and Virginia, with Alaska yet to be called on the GOP side.’ ’In their victory speeches, the two  for the potential faceoff in the months ahead.’ ’"Instead of building walls, we’’re going to break down barriers and build ladders of opportunity and empowerment so every American can live up to his or her potential," Clinton said, in an implicit attack on Trump’’s calls to build a wall on the southern border of the US to combat illegal immigration.’ ’She also took a shot at Trump’’s campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again. "’ ’"We know we’’ve got work to do. It’’s not to make America great again," Clinton said. "America never stopped being great. We have to make America whole . .. and fill in what’’s been hollowed out.
