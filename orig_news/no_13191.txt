Friday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends," while discussing a sniper targeting and killing five Dallas police officers and wounding seven, former presidential candidate and advisor to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Dr. Ben Carson said President Barack Obama should not have brought up gun control this morning during his comments on murders because "now is definitely not the time to get political. "  Carson said, "Now is definitely not the time to get political. Now is the time to use logic, and ask ourselves, ‘Why do we have a Constitution? Why do we have a Second Amendment? They’re always saying you don’t need a   weapon to hunt deer. The Constitution is not about deer hunting, it’s about people being able to defend themselves from an overly aggressive government or an external invasion.
