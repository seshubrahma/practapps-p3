(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. _____ 1. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain became the first foreign leader to meet President Donald Trump. Ms. May had been on edge over Mr. Trump’s gleeful support of her country’s withdrawal from the European Union, which she opposed but has to carry out. But they vowed to work together on security and trade as they met at the White House, affirming the "special relationship" between the two countries. Our reporters offered   analysis, which you can see along with the video of their press conference here. Later in the day, Mr. Trump traveled to the Pentagon, where he ordered "new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out" of the country. He closed the nation’s borders to refugees from around the world and temporarily suspended immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries The American Civil Liberties Union described it as a "euphemism for discriminating against Muslims. " The move was met with disappointment across the Muslim world, with many saying it would be interpreted as a sign that Mr. Trump sees Islam itself as the problem. _____ 2. Mr. Trump also addressed his feud with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico. The two spoke by phone on Friday morning, a day after Mr. Peña Nieto canceled a trip to Washington. Mr. Trump said that it was a "very friendly call" but repeated that he would take a tough stance on trade. Mr. Peña Nieto’s office released a statement saying that they had agreed not to speak publicly about who will pay for the wall. Above, some of the existing fencing. _____ 3. On the Mexican side of the border, there’s deep worry over the impact of Mr. Trump’s immigration policies. Many places are already overwhelmed by migrants from Central America. In Tijuana, above, Haitians hoping to cross the border have crowded into churches and community centers. Immigrants’ advocates say the Mexican government isn’t doing enough to address the crisis, and local charities don’t have the capacity to deal with a big wave of deportees. _____ 4. Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the   March for Life on the National Mall. He became the   official ever to speak in person at the march, which has taken place every year since the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade, in 1973. With the Trump administration on their side, activists opposed to abortion rights are preparing to seize a   political opportunity. _____ 5. France has banned soda refills in an effort to combat obesity and diabetes. The French are, on average, less overweight than Americans and other Europeans. The proportion of overweight or obese adults in France was reported to be 15. 3 percent in 2014. In the U. S. it is 36. 5 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _____ 6. The Australian Open finals are this weekend. Rafael Nadal, above, beat Grigor Dimitrov in a match that lasted nearly five hours. That set him up to face Roger Federer in Sunday’s final. Nadal and Federer have not met in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 French Open. It’s a nostalgic counterpoint to the women’s championship match between Venus Williams and Serena Williams on Saturday. _____ 7. An audacious plan to respond to climate change by building a city of floating islands in the South Pacific is moving forward. The government of French Polynesia has agreed to consider hosting the islands in a tropical lagoon. The project is led by a California nonprofit, the Seasteading Institute, which has raised about $2. 5 million and says work on the project could start as early as next year. _____ 8. Some theater news: Bryan Cranston, above, will star at the National Theater in London in a stage adaptation of the film "Network," about TV executives and their Machiavellian maneuvers for higher ratings. And Elton John and the playwright Paul Rudnick have signed on to write a musical adaptation of "The Devil Wears Prada" for Broadway. _____ 9. One night six years ago, a reporter found an old photo album on the sidewalk near her home in Brooklyn. It revealed a rich history of black lives, from the segregated South to Harlem dance halls. Last spring, she began the long process of finding its owners. Here is their story.
