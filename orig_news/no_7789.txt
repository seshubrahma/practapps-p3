Donald Trump appears likely to select Chicago Cubs   Todd Ricketts as deputy secretary of the Commerce Department, CNN reports. [The Ricketts family spent millions to defeat Trump in the Republican primaries, which led to criticism of their stewardship of the Cubs and oblique accusations from the candidate. Trump tweeted, "I hear the Rickets family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $’s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide!"  "It’s a little surreal when Donald Trump threatens your mom," brother Tom Ricketts said back in February. "The fact is, whether it’s my mom or my dad on his Ending Spending stuff or my sister on marriage equality or my brothers and what they do or what we do with the team, we’re pretty much an open book. " Time, and money, heals all wounds. After vigorously working against Trump during the fight for the nomination, the Ricketts family pivoted and poured millions into his general election campaign. The support apparently paid off for Todd Ricketts, whose older brother serves as the governor of Nebraska. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Wilbur Ross looks likely to lead the Commerce Department. Like Trump, Ricketts enjoyed an amazing year beating the odds and making history. Down three games to one, the Chicago Cubs won their first World Series since 1908.
