During an interview broadcast on Monday’s "Charlie Rose," Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) stated of   Donald Trump’s election that the media and establishment don’t understand there are "there are tens of millions of people, who are not racists, who are not sexist, they’re hurting. "  Sanders said that while he was surprised Trump won, he wasn’t shocked because "[W]hat the media doesn’t understand, what the establishment doesn’t understand, is there are tens of millions of people, who are not racists, who are not sexist, they’re hurting. " Sanders later added that while it’s possible FBI Director James Comey’s letter to Congress made the difference, the "deeper question" is how the Democratic Party lost to a candidate like Trump, and this "goes a lot deeper than what the FBI did, a lot deeper than that. And that speaks to where the Democratic Party is today, how it sees it itself. What is the Democratic Party? You know what concerns me very much, we have a lot of Democrats who spend much of their life, you know what they do much of their life? They’re out raising money from wealthy people. Out raising  —   now, in day and age, as a result of Citizens United, money is very important. I know it, but you can’t just spend your entire life raising money from the wealthy people. What Trump was doing, to his credit, he was going out holding rallies. He was going all over this country. He was going in rural areas, where candidates previously did not go. In many ways, I did that myself. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
