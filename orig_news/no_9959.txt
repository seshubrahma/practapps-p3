Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is using Twitter to criticize the media. [In more than a dozen different tweets, the New Yorker called out the The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and The Hill.  Trump tells his more than eight million Twitter followers that the media is "on a   against me. False reporting, and plenty of it  —   but we will prevail!" Trump’s tweets began on Friday, calling out The Hill for a story it did about him and carbon tax. . @thehill  Your story about me  the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect —  it is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 13, 2016,  On Saturday and again on Monday morning, Trump went after CNN. Wow, @CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad  as possible. Very unprofessional. Hurting in ratings  —   bad television!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2016,  A political commentator for @cnn, which I no longer watch, said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries." I set   record!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2016,  Trump also used his Twitter account to walk back a report from The Washington Post, which quoted Trump surrogate Dr. Ben Carson revealing five of Trump’s vice presidential picks. The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2016,  Most of Trump’s tweets throughout the weekend came after the New York Times published a story about Trump and women on Saturday, titled, "Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private. " On Monday, a key source disputed the New York Times article during an interview on Fox and Friends. The failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women, they found nothing. A joke!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2016,  Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women. I gave them many names of women I   to use,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2016,  Why doesn’t the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2016,  Wow, I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. Massive front page for that!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2016,  Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2016,  The media is really on a   against me. False reporting, and plenty of it  —   but we will prevail!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2016,  That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends  —   I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2016,  The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2016,  Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied,  —   Donald J.
