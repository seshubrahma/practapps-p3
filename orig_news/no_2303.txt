It was a   day for the team covering politics at The New York Times on Wednesday. In the late afternoon, Donald J. Trump was playing the diplomat in Mexico City with President Enrique Peña Nieto, standing alongside a state leader and vowing to treat everyone living or residing in the United States with great dignity. "So important," Trump added. By that evening, Trump was goosing a rowdy crowd in Phoenix and ensuring that anyone who entered the United States illegally would be subject to deportation, especially the criminals among them. The problem back in The Times’s newsroom was that its main news story  —   published online after Trump spoke in Phoenix  —   captured more of Mexico’s demure Trump than the familiar firebrand who jetted to Arizona. For many readers, the story looked like a significant misportrayal of events. Anyone coming to the Times site around 11 p. m. over an hour after Trump’s speech began, saw a story that seemed blind to the angry, aggressive rhetoric that Trump delivered to his voting base along the border. Liam Burke of San Jose, Calif. was among them. "As others have no doubt mentioned, I was surprised to see the lede to this article," he wrote. "This description of Trump’s speech seems simply false and diminishing of the extreme,   racist rhetoric he offered. As the paper of record, don’t you feel you have a responsibility to accurately represent the intensity of Trump’s rage and the danger he poses to American values?" I can see why Burke and others are questioning the piece. They should be. After all, it seemed not to match the Trump they just saw on TV, even though the Times story was posted after the Arizona event. Here’s the top of the piece: This 11 p. m. version made no mention of Trump’s invitation to have individuals join him onstage to share the names of relatives who they said were killed by illegal immigrants. Nor did it refer to Trump’s line that his enforcement priorities would include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays and those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals. That doesn’t sound like a stark turnaround from the old Trump. Several prominent components of the coverage, including a live chat at the top of the homepage, were being quickly updated with the Arizona Trump. But the main news story was not significantly updated until an hour later, around midnight. By then it captured the more aggressive Trump and delivered a more balanced portrayal of the day. What happened? Why did the first version seem so off and why wasn’t The Times more transparent about the changes? I asked Carolyn Ryan, The Times’s political editor, for an explanation. "Trump acted jarringly differently in Phoenix than he did in Mexico, and we scrambled to reflect that, without obscuring the fact that he was backing away from his policy to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants," she said. "I think readers were eager to see the fiery language and belligerent tone in Phoenix reflected quickly in the story, especially if they had just watched his appearance, and I understand that. " What that boils down to is: We were moving as fast as we could and the story changed on us. The flaw in hanging this simply on tight deadlines and   facts is that many other major news sites managed to hit the mark. Politico was up not long after the Times article with a piece that said Trump squashed any speculation that he might soften on immigration, "delivering a hawkish, hardline, and     border platform and vowing that on Day One of his administration, the United States would launch a mammoth deportation program and begin construction of a wall. " The Washington Post, also posting around the same time, had updated its article to say that hours after leaving Mexico Trump returned to his aggressive tenor on immigration, yelling at the crowd in Arizona and promising to subject illegals to deportation. The Arizona Republic was up with a similar piece. Ryan maintains that The Times was on the news too. She said that there has been too much focus on this single piece. Her team, she said, primarily relies on both live discussions and concise briefings on breaking news, and indeed these features dominated the homepage Wednesday night. "We aggressively update our coverage, minute by minute, through our live chat, which highlights and analyzes political events as they unfold, and our live briefing, which tells readers what they have missed," she said. "Both are enormously popular with readers, and they have given us a flexible platform to drive   coverage in politics. " Worthwhile point. But I’m not sure that a rolling discussion among staff members and a briefing roundup satisfies the needs of readers landing on the Times site wanting a clear sense of a confusing story. And if all the reporters on the live chat are up on the latest developments, why can’t some of that make it into the main news story? Here’s my take. I see nothing nefarious or   on the part of any editors or reporters involved in the Trump piece. Everyone was scrambling with   news across time zones, many moving parts, and both print and web deadlines. But given the complications of the story  —   an unpredictable candidate, brutal deadlines  —   it seems the newsroom was not in position to deliver a strong coverage package. None of the main political writers were on the scene in Mexico City or in Arizona and Patrick Healy, writer of the lead story, drew the short straw of producing both the version for the print edition and for the web. In this instance, Healy would have greatly benefited from being relieved of writing the print story in order to concentrate on the web. That might have given him some extra time to absorb the news in Phoenix and make sense of the changing rhetoric. All of this may sound like tedious newsroom mechanics, but mistakes can have a genuine impact on The Times’s reputation among readers. In a climate where sinister motives are attached to every word and headline The Times produces, looking squarely at such episodes is a step worth taking.
