(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Congressional Republicans, infuriated by the F. B. I. ’s decision not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton, summoned the bureau’s director, James Comey, to hearings on Thursday. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said she accepted the bureau’s recommendation, ending the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said Mrs. Clinton’s use of private email servers as secretary of state showed that she could not be trusted with classified material. But some Republicans fretted that Donald Trump and his small campaign organization were not capitalizing on Mr. Comey’s harsh criticism of Mrs. Clinton. _____ 2. Mrs. Clinton tried to redirect attention, disparaging Mr. Trump’s business practices at a stop in Atlantic City. "He always rigged it so he got paid no matter how his companies performed," she said in front of one of his failed casinos. At a separate event in North Carolina, she responded to the leftward pressure exerted by Bernie Sanders’s campaign, announcing plans to eliminate college tuition at   public colleges and universities for families with annual incomes under $125, 000. _____ 3. "Donald Trump is not   and he’s not a racist. " That’s Jared Kushner, his    and the publisher of The Observer, declaring that Mr. Trump should not be held responsible for the views of fringe followers who barrage some Jewish reporters with   comments. In a lengthy   Mr. Kushner disclosed how his family members suffered and died in the Holocaust. He said terms like " " were "being thrown around with a carelessness that risks rendering these words meaningless. " On Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump delivered a speech that seemed to clash with Mr. Kushner’s   defending a broadly criticized image posted to his Twitter account that showed a picture of Hillary Clinton next to a   star. _____ 4. Gretchen Carlson, the longtime Fox News anchor, stunned the TV industry with a lawsuit accusing the network’s chairman, Roger Ailes, of firing her after she refused his sexual advances. The suit says Mr. Ailes propositioned Ms. Carlson in response to her complaints of rife sexual harassment in the workplace. It says he responded to her rejection by cutting her salary and airtime, and then declining to renew her contract. _____ 5. The Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into a fatal police shooting in Baton Rouge, La. A video of the episode shows that two officers had a black man, Alton Sterling, 37, pinned to the ground before opening fire. Louisiana’s governor, John Bel Edwards, pleaded with protesters to remain peaceful, acknowledging, "The video is disturbing, to say the least. " _____ 6. Hoverboards don’t hover, but the Consumer Product Safety Commission says they do combust. The agency recalled more than a   of the     scooters, saying they had caused at least 60 fires and were responsible for at least $2 million in property damage. _____ 7. At war with clutter? Reinforcements are near. Marie Kondo, the Japanese organizer whose lodestar is joy, has an army of proselytizers in training to bring her "  Magic of Tidying Up" to a wider audience. One acolyte is taking her system a step further: raising the bar to letting stuff in the house in the first place. _____ 8. Oscar Pistorius was resentenced for fatally shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, this time drawing six years in prison. A higher court had sent back his initial   sentence for manslaughter, saying the disabled South African runner should be sentenced for murder. The judge explained her rejection of prosecutors’ request for at least 15 years: "He’s a fallen hero who has lost his career and is ruined financially. "The worst is that having taken the life of a fellow human being in the manner that he did, he cannot be at peace. " _____ 9. Britain got its moment of reckoning for the Iraq war. An independent panel’s findings excoriated former Prime Minister Tony Blair for blindly accepting flawed U. S. intelligence and promising George W. Bush loyalty. Mr. Blair responded with a nearly   news conference in which he acknowledged profound mistakes but pleaded for understanding. After the   terrorist attacks on the U. S. he said, "We were in a new world. " _____ 10.  The other war the U. S. entered after the   attacks grinds on. President Obama slowed his already delayed drawdown of troops from Afghanistan, saying, "The security situation remains precarious. " He plans to leave 8, 400 troops there, handing his successor a military commitment he had intended to end before he left office. _____ 11. Finally, two French entrepreneurs are trying to change the way Parisians view immigrants. They recruited chefs from Syria, Chechnya, Iran, India, Sri Lanka and, above left, Ethiopia, and have catered 20 events since February, including lunches, dinners and buffets. "The cuisine of a place gives pleasure," said one of the businessmen. "This is part of immigration, too. " _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
