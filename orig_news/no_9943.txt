Sunday, Rep. Peter King ( ) denied on New York AM 970 radio’s "The Cats Roundtable" claims that the Russians hacked the Democratic National Committee in order to assist   Donald Trump win the election.  "There is a consensus now that the Russians did hack the Democratic National Committee. They tried to hack the Republican National Committee and were not successful. As for those John Podesta emails, it’s inconclusive as to who hacked them. They cannot prove that the Russians did it. But the one thing I can tell you is we’ve been told by everyone privately, publicly that the CIA, nor do any of the intelligence agencies, have any information that the Russians were not trying to tip the election in Donald Trump’s favor. The Director of the FBI has said what he believes is the Russians   …     they just wanted to undermine the election," King told host John Catsimatidis. "There is no CIA report, there is no CIA conclusion. This is somebody in the CIA, or somebody in the intelligence community, or someone in the House or the Senate who’s taken some piece of information and are saying this. This is a lie," he added.
