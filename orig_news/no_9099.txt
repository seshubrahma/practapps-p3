On Saturday afternoon an Imam and his friend were shot and killed in Queens as they were walking home from their mosque. [A lone gunman was caught on video walking up behind the two about 2 pm, shooting both, then fleeing the scene. NYPD Deputy Inspector Henry Sautner said, "There is nothing in the preliminary investigation that would indicate that they were targeted because of their faith. "  According to the New York Post, the Imam,    Maulana Akonjee, was walking with    Thara Uddin when both were killed. The two men had just prayed at "Al Furqan Jame Masjid on 77th Street and Glenmore Avenue. " Akonjee was originally from Bangladesh and one man who knew him described him as "the pope for [the] neighborhood. " Mashuk Uddin saw his older brother lying on the ground after being shot. Mashuk said, "I don’t even know, nobody knows what’s going on. This broke my heart. I miss my big brother. " One resident in the area heard the gunshots. The resident —  who did not want to be identified —  said there were "two shots, then more. " Afterward, the resident saw "a man with a gun running down the street. " The resident said there were a number of other people around that could have been shot, but the gunman only killed Akonjee and Uddin.
