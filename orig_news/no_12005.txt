On Tuesday’s broadcast of "CNN Tonight," CNN Political Commentator Marc Lamont Hill reacted to NFL great Jim Brown’s praise of Donald Trump by saying that "to suggest that he’s gone through some admirable process is disturbing to me. " And "to say you fell in love with Donald Trump or his platform or his campaign to me is disturbing. "  Hill stated, "I love Jim Brown, I saw him earlier on CNN. I didn’t know what he had said. I would have asked him. You know, I’m stunned, to be honest. What Donald Trump went through to be president was to play on racial division, to play on white supremacy, to play on xenophobia. For Donald Trump to then  —   to have gone through  —   to suggest that he’s gone through some admirable process is disturbing to me. So, no, I don’t have any admiration for Donald Trump or his process. Now, I don’t have a problem with Jim Brown saying, look, we want to do urban development. We want housing. We want to make demands of you, but to say you fell in love with Donald Trump or his platform or his campaign to me is disturbing. " He later added that Trump has had a hard time convincing skeptical black voters with his public persona "because they hear what he says, they watch what he’s done. They watch how he essentially railroaded  —   attempted to railroad through the media the Central Park Five. They’ve watched his lack of philanthropy over the last few decades. They’ve watched a career of essentially dangling black people around as almost puppets or trinkets. That’s not to suggest that Donald Trump doesn’t have any real black friends. But when look at his political commitments, when we look at where his economic investments are, they don’t suggest any kind of care for the black community.
