Tuesday on Newsmax TV’s "The Joe Pags Show," while discussing   Donald Trump naming ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state,  Trump’s transition team senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said Tillerson will implement the American first Trump doctrine.  Conway said, "This is just someone who is a Trumpian kind of pick if you will. He is somebody who Donald Trump told me just today when he met Rex Tillerson he saw him as somebody who is incredibly experienced. They clicked as fellow successful businessmen. And he thinks he brings an entire different dimension. What people want to dismiss as a liability is actually an asset.  The ability to go and advance US interests, our sovereignty, our security and our stealth around the globe. Implementing the Trump doctrine which of course is an American first doctrine around the globe. And that is what the secretary of state will do. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
