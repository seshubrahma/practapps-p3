Mike Pence of Indiana as his running mate just in time: The Republican National Convention opens Monday in Cleveland. Security is already tight. Ohio is an   state, and some of the protesters flooding the city have promised to bring their weapons. Mr. Trump’s showmanship, honed by his years as a reality TV star, will be on display, as will his appeal to frustrated white voters  —   and possibly also what our special report identifies as his tendency to be creative with the truth. _____ 7.

In fact, more than half of all voters hold unfavorable views of the two, and large majorities say neither is honest and trustworthy.

S. and Russia announced a tentative deal to coordinate airstrikes against the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda’s affiliate.
