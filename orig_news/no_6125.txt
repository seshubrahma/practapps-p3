Apple CEO Tim Cook called for technology companies to filter out "fake news" during an interview with Good Morning Britain on Friday. ["You have to give the consumer tools to help with this," said Cook. "We’ve got to filter out part of it before it ever gets there without losing the great openness of the internet. "  "This is one of today’s chief problems," he continued. "It is not something that has a simple solution.

In November, a professor at Merrimack College, Massachusetts, included Breitbart News in her "fake news" list, which went viral online. But several news outlets have been exposed by Breitbart News for writing their own "fake news," including the Independent, the Daily Beast, CNN (numerous times) the Atlantic, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. There have also been several reports that Facebook is planning to team up with a range of " " to help filter out fake news from their platform, including the     sites Politifact and Snopes.

Fellow Snopes   Bethania Palmer attempted to link Trump to the KKK, defended a racist professor, wrote numerous   articles for Raw Story, including two attempting to associate former Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon to domestic violence and white supremacy, and acts as a contributor for the "progressive"   Truthout. David Emery, another   and staff writer at Snopes, openly asked on Twitter whether there were "any   Trump supporters. " Despite their clear political biases, all three were tasked with   political candidates over the 2016 presidential election under the guise of a neutral service. It was also recently revealed that David Brock’s   watchdog Media Matters was "engaging with Facebook behind the scenes" to shape the social network’s handling of "fake news.
