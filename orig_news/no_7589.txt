Republican nominee Donald Trump railed against the Democratic Party  —   Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Hillary Clinton, and Tim Kaine  —   during his town hall with his running mate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence in Roanoke, Virginia on Monday afternoon. ["Debbie Wasserman Schultz  —   I always knew she was highly overrated. Not good, but she just got fired," Trump stated about former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz, who had to step down after WikiLeaks revealed internal emails from the Democratic National Committee showing she wasn’t neutral between Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) and Hillary Clitnon. "They said, ‘Debbie you’re fired  …    get out! ’"  "How about that for disloyalty though?" Trump added, saying Wasserman Schultz "has been so much for Hillary Clinton. " "Hillary Clinton knew what was going on. She knew everything that was going on," Trump alleged of Clinton, saying she knew "that Bernie Sanders never had a chance" in the "rigged system. " "Debbie Wasserman Schultz  —   what she did in order to make sure the rigged system stays in tact and Hillary gets it," he challenged. "She worked very very hard to rig the system. " Trump said Sen. Bernie Sanders "folded. " "I guarantee we’ll find the 33, 000 emails," Trump taunted, following the WikiLeaks email leak, referencing Clinton’s email scandal where several thousand were deleted. "Why did Hillary get rid of her middle name?" Trump asked the crowd. He joked it was "too close" to "Hillary Rotten Clinton," appearing to play off of Clinton’s full name, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Trump also took time to trash Clinton’s vice presidential pick Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) in his home state. "The unemployment rate more than doubled," under Kaine’s watch, Trump challenged. "This is your great governor, right?"
