Obama thinks so little of Muslims that he won’t call out problems in the community: Obama, in my reading, does not —  contra his   critics —  suffer illusions about the pathologies afflicting the broader Muslim world. If anything, his pessimism on matters related to the dysfunctions of Muslim states, and to the inability of the umma —  the worldwide community of Muslims —  to contain and ultimately neutralize the extremist elements in its midst, has, at times, an almost paralyzing effect on him. The president has come to the conclusion (as I outlined in my recent Atlantic cover story, "The Obama Doctrine") that the underlying problems afflicting Islam are too deep, and too resistant to American intervention, to warrant implementation of the sort of policies that his critics, including his critics in   think tanks, demand. 12:26 PM  —   Obama bringing gun control sermon to prayer vigil.
