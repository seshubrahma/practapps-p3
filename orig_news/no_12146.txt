The main topic at the     confab? How to stop Republican   Donald Trump. Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google   Larry Page, Napster creator and Facebook investor Sean Parker, and Tesla Motors and SpaceX honcho Elon Musk all attended.

Clinton says "an ally, for sure. " She says they have differences and are passionate about their positions and differences. She says to compare that the Republicans and "how they behave. " She says she is proud of their campaigns and she hopes to work with Sanders if she wins the nomination because Sanders’s supporters will be important in the general election and beyond. "Let’s not get ahead of ourselves," Clinton says when asked about whether Sanders will be her VP pick. [Clinton, for the most part, ran out the clock on Fox News. Fox News gleefully asked Trump about his comments about women. For some reason, Fox News never brought up whether Bill Clinton’s past affairs will haunt her during the campaign. The network did not ask her if it is hypocritical to play the "war on women" card. Fox News did not ask her if she stopped playing the "sexism" card on Trump after Trump accused her of enabling her husband’s shenanigans and intimidating women who came forward. The network did not ask her why so many alleged sexual assault victims from her husband’s past are now speaking against him. Just like Mitt Romney, Fox News was tougher on Trump than on Democrats. The network, at the very least, could have brought up the "war on women"  issues even while giving those issues the   treatment.] 6:56: Baier asks Clinton why young   are not supporting her. She says it is good that Democrats are bringing more people into the process and she again repeats her line that she will be for them even if they are not for her. [Same answer she has given at nearly every  .] 6:50: Questioner asks why Clinton supported the ’90s Crime Bill and whether she would support the same bill if it were on the table today. She says Sanders voted for it while she just "supported it. " She says there were some positive things in the crime bill the combat the crime epidemic. But she says that there were problems that were solved but there were also "mistakes made. " She says the bill set off a chain reaction where more and more people got incarcerated when they should not have been. She says we have to replace the "  " pipeline with a "  " pipeline. She calls on Michigan’s governor to return control of the Detroit schools back to Detroit. She touts her   tuition plan to make college more affordable. She differentiates her plan from Sanders’s. Clinton says "her numbers add up" when asked about reducing the country’s debt and implies that Sanders’s numbers don’t. 6:49: Baier asks Clinton who were favorite Republican is. Same question CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked. She gives the same answer.   Susan Collins and John McCain. She says she will hesitate to name name because it will hurt them. 6:46: Questioner wonders how Clinton will get anything done in Washington when "compromise is a bad word. " Clinton says that when she was First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, she worked with some of the most partisan Republicans. She talks up her role in the passage of CHIP and foster care issues. Clinton says Republicans say really nice things about her when she is not running and she has a ton of archival material [Republicans may regret praising Clinton in order to attack Obama in 2008]. She says "compromise is not a dirty word" and it is the way "democracy has to work. " 6:41: Baier asks Clinton about her email scandal. He says Democrats are worried that another shoe will drop. Clinton says it was a "mistake" to use a personal server. She says a lot of government officials have done the same (they have not used private servers though some may have used private email accounts). Speaking in legalese, Clinton says she nothing she sent or received was "MARKED CLASSIFIED. " Baier asks Clinton whether she lied when she said there was no classified material on her servers after the State Department found 22   emails. Clinton says the State Department decides what is and isn’t classified. She says she will reiterate that nothing she sent or received was "marked classified. " She doesn’t say just "classified" anymore like she did at the March press conference. Clinton says the some of the classified emails that were found were "not classified at the time. " She says after FOIA requests, government agents can later decide to classify various emails because they do not want to release. Clinton’s explaining and she’s losing on this answer. 6:37: Baier asks Clinton about abortion  …     She says that Roe v. Wade is "rooted" in the Constitution and women have this "right" to make this "highly personal decision with their family, in accordance with their faith, with their doctor. " She says it is not much of a "right" if it is "totally limited and constrained. " She says we have to continue to stand up for a woman’s right to "make these decisions" and "defend Planned Parenthood. " Her supporters in the audience cheer. Clinton rejects banning abortions after 20 weeks. [  thing   are fundamental rights  …    ] 6:34: Baier asks Clinton about Libya and points out that it is in total chaos after Clinton’s "smart power" (borrowed from Joseph Nye) foreign policy strategy there. She says Qaddafi was a ruthless dictator whom Reagan tried to once take out. Clinton, after repeating talking points, says what has happened is "deeply regrettable. " She says it is fair to say that if there hadn’t been the intervention, we would be looking at something resembling Syria. When Baier asks whether Clinton would put U. S. troops on the ground in Libya, Clinton says not "combat troops. " She says there is a concerted effort to unify the different elements in Libya and concedes Libya has not been as successful as Tunisia. 6:33: Hillary on Fox News. Baier asks Clinton about Bloomberg’s decision not to run. She says she has the greatest respect for Bloomberg, who conveniently slammed Trump and Cruz in his announcement. 6:29: When asked if Sanders will accept a VP nomination, he says he is running to be President of the United States. 6:28: Questioner asks Sanders what his plan is to rebuild the country’s infrastructure. Sanders says "we should not be having a Flint, Michigan" water crisis in the wealthiest country in the world. He says we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. He talks about bridges, water systems, etc. Sanders says he has proposed spending $1 trillion over five years to make sure   have the resources they need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Sanders says $1 trillion sounds like a lot of money but civil engineers say even more needs to be spent. He says his plan will create $13 million jobs. 6:27: Sanders says he will not reveal his favorite Republican because it will be a disservice to that person. 6:23: Sanders says he will not rely on executive action to push his   agenda. He pivots and says there are too many lawmakers worried about securing donations from wealth people. He says that is why Congress is not listening to ordinary people and only listening to Wall Street, multinational corporations, and large campaign contributors. When Baier asks how he would convince a GOP Congress to enact  his agenda, Sanders says if he becomes president, it will have been because of a massive voter turnout  …    He says if that happens, the Republicans will not continue to control the Senate "and have a lot less seats in the House. " Sanders claims there is overwhelming support to raise the minimum wage and his voters will pressure lawmakers to raise it, etc  …    He will mobilize millions of voters who will also demand pay equity. 6:21: Baier asks if Sanders thinks abortion should be illegal at any stage of pregnancy. He says it is wrong for the government to tell  a woman what to do with her own body. Sanders also says he respects opposing viewpoints. Sanders says he is "very strongly  " when asked whether abortions should be banned after five months except for the health of the mother. He says that decision is between the woman, her doctor, and her family. 6:17: Questioner asks Sanders to explain his healthcare system. He again insists that it is a "right for all people. " Questioner has concerns about replacing the current system with "Medicare for all. " Sanders says that is what Clinton is trying to scare people about and says he will not leave anyone behind as president. Sanders says we have made good progress but we still have millions who are underinsured. He says many Americans are sicker because they didn’t go to the doctor before because of high deductibles or could not afford prescription drugs that doctors prescribed. 6:14: Questioner says he will speak for the American public and say Sanders is much more honest than Sanders. He’s also a Trump supporter. He asks Sanders whether taxing the rich will hurt job creators. Sanders says we have to put in context what has happened in the last 30 years. He says there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the working class to the top 1%. Sanders blasts America’s unfair trade deals. He says corporations will invest in America and not in China. He says he does not believe in   economics. Sanders says he believes that more money needs to be put in the hands of working families by raising the minimum wage to a living wage. He talks about the country’s poor infrastructure and asks why the infrastructure is collapsing in the wealthiest country in the world. He blasts corporations for stashing their profits offshore and not paying a nickel in taxes. 6:13: First questioner asks Sanders about ISIS. Sanders says ISIS is a "barbaric organization that has to be destroyed. " He says that one of the differences between Clinton and himself is he voted against the Iraq War while Clinton voted for it. He says  a lot of the   resulted from that "disastrous decision. " Sanders says the United States needs to work with its allies in the Middle East to combat ISIS. He says what is happening to Christians and Muslims is "horrific" when asked about Christian prosecution. 6:10: When Baier asks Sanders if he shares the concern of his supporters that Clinton is not "honest and trustworthy. " Sanders says he will let Americans decide that. He says he is proud he received 86% of the vote in Vermont. 6:06: Sanders explains that he wanted the 1% to bail out Wall Street and not the taxpayers at a Fox News town hall event. Baier presses Sanders how he would prevent a debt crisis with his spending plans. Sanders says by guaranteeing health care to all people, the average   family would save about $  on healthcare costs. He says healthcare is a "right of all people. " When asked where the right came from, Sanders says, "being a human being. " Sanders says the poor (if she is poor and you are rich) are entitled to the same healthcare as the rich because "she is a human being. " Sanders is scrambling on how he would bring down the debt. Now reverting to talking points about free public college for all  …     He now says he will pay for his programs by taxing Wall Street speculation. "It’s Wall Street’s turn to help the middle class of this country," he says. 6:05: Trump suggests immigration pause. He says   minorities will benefit the most (FLASHBACK: Slate’s Jamelle Bouie: ‘Not a Bad Play’ for Trump to Court Black Voters with  . S. Worker Immigration Plan): "Record rates of immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for U. S. workers. Pew polling shows 83 percent of all voters  —   Democrats, Republicans and Independents  —   think immigration should be frozen or reduced. The biggest beneficiaries of allowing fewer foreign workers into our country would be minority workers, including all immigrants now living here, who are competing for jobs, benefits and community resources against record waves of foreign workers. Limiting job competition would reopen pathways to   stability and shrink welfare rolls. In addition, it would relieve overcrowding in our schools and hospitals that afflict our poorest communities. Yet, Senators Cruz and Rubio have led the charge for even higher immigration rates  —   a policy supported by only 7 percent of the Republican electorate. When I am President we will listen to the people  —   not the special interests  —   and get immigration numbers under control, as the voters have demanded.

But privately, the campaign is having a debate about whether or not he should remain in the mix  —   even for his home state of Florida’s primary. "He doesn’t want to get killed in his home state," one source familiar with the discussions said, noting "a poor showing would be a risk and hurt his political future.

Trump has laid bare the ridiculousness of the conservative label. In 2016, the word conservative can be seen as a tool of influence  —   a shaming tool  —   used by the party elites to bring people together under their handpicked puppet. Conservativedoesn’t have a normal definition that is useful and widely understood. That’s why it works so well for persuasion. If it had a rigid definition, lots of people could find a reason to disagree. But by leaving the definition of conservative in ambiguity, people see nothing with which they can disagree. That is classic persuasion. 11:04  —   Compared to previous winners, Rubio   in Puerto Rico, Final Puerto Rico vote: Rubio 71%.
