[Miller is perhaps the one Trump surrogate who is ready for prime time and can spar with the mainstream media’s best.] 6:15: Miller says the most important factor regarding foreign policy is philosophy. He says Trump’s philosophy is "America First," which means NATO will have to pay its fair share and no nation building. He says Clinton represents an "internationalist,   foreign policy" that seeks to   with American blood and dollars. Miller says "you have to send a message to our allies" that they have to pay their fair shares instead of being freeloaders. Miller says Clinton represents a failed "  consensus" that has proven to be "disastrous. " Miller points out that Clinton, as Secretary of State, allowed her husband to give speeches Chinese government entities while those entities had business before Clinton’s State Department. He notes that all of this is documented in Breitbart News Senior    and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer’s Clinton Cash book. Miller says the Chinese government funneled money into the Clinton’s bank account while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. "That is corruption on a scale beyond imagination," Miller tells Wolf Blitzer. 6:10: On CNN, Trump’s Senior Adviser Stephen Miller says that Clinton’s decision to make this a referendum on foreign policy is the worst decision since her Libya policy.

He’s jealous as hell of it, and he’s angry that people respond positively to it. I told you yesterday. I told you yesterday, there’s all kinds of jealously. One of the reasons that Trump has got some opposition, is there are people jealous. There are all kinds of people in politics, in the media  —   you name it elsewhere  —   corporate America, jealous. They would love to be Trump. They would love to experience what Trump is experienced. They would love to be the focal point and the recipient of all of this positive energy, massive crowds.   5:10: Sanders courting super delegates after his campaign called "presumptive nominee" Hillary Clinton "presumptuous.

"I’d say no," he said, adding that he’d tell him it was a "really bad idea.

" 3:36: Clinton says Donald Trump’s "got it all wrong" and says "don’t let anyone tell you America isn’t great. " She says this election is a "choice between two very different visions of America. " "One that’s angry, afraid and based on the idea that America is fundamentally weak and in decline," Clinton says. "The other is hopeful, generous and confident in the knowledge that America is great just like we always have been. " 3:35: Clinton on potential Trump presidency: "historical mistake. " She says a Trump presidency will fuel an "ugly narrative" about who we are. 3:33: Clinton says every president faces "hard choices" every day with imperfect information. She says making the right call takes a "cool head" and "respect for the facts" and a "willingness to listen" to other’s points of view with humility. She says it also takes someone who understands he doesn’t know everything because someone who thinks he does won’t ask the tough questions. Clinton asks voters to imagine if Trump had the entire American arsenal at his disposal instead of just his Twitter account when someone angers him. "Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?" 3:31: Clinton says Trump should remember that plenty of Muslims and immigrants fight in our Armed Forces every time he insults immigrants and Muslims. She says Donald Trump can learn something from them. 3:28: Clinton blasts Trump’s Muslim ban and says it will embolden ISIS. She also says "this isn’t reality television. This is actual reality. " She says defending the homeland takes more than "empty talk and slogans. " 3:27: Clinton claims Trump has "no idea" how to stop ISIS. She mocks Trump’s comments about giving ISIS Syria. Clinton: "We cannot put the lives of our young men and women in uniform in Donald Trump’s hands"  —   Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) June 2, 2016,  3:23: Clinton says she can’t understand Trump’s "bizarre fascination" with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America. Clinton says Putin will eat Trump’s lunch. "I will leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants," @HillaryClinton says of @realDonaldTrump #NBC2016,  —   Kasie Hunt (@kasie) June 2, 2016,  3:20: Clinton says there is no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf course deal. She says being interviewed on 60 Minutes on the same episode as Putin doesn’t mean you can deal with him. Right on cue, Clinton says she’s willing to bet Trump is writing a few "nasty Tweets" right now. 3:19: Trump blasts Clinton’s "poor performance" reading off of a TelePrompTer: Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn’t even look presidential!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2016,  3:16: Clinton says the Kremlin will be "celebrating" if Trump becomes president. 3:15: Paul Ryan endorses Trump for president just as Hillary Clinton talks about wanting a "confident America.

" She says she believes America is an "exceptional country" and not a country that "cowers behind walls. " 3:10: Clinton says Trump will take America down a "truly dangerous path. " She then robotically reads her resume. 3:09: Clinton accuses Trump of believing that America is "weak" and calling the U. S. military a "disaster. " 3:08: Clinton says Trump believes he can treat the U. S. economy like one of his casinos and default on the debt. [Clinton, like Romney, sounds robotic attacking Trump by reading off of a TelePrompter. Trump’s "personal" attacks are much more effective because voters believe they come from the heart and weren’t written for him by consultants who reviewed hours of focus group tapes.] 3:07: Clinton says Trump temperamentally unfit to occupy the White House. "This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes," she says. Clinton says it’s not hard to imaging Trump leading us into war because someone got under his "very thin skin. " She warns against Trump "rolling the dice" with America.

She says Trump’s ideas are "dangerous. " She says they are not even ideas but bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies. 3:05: Clinton says she’s going to keep America’s security at the heart of her campaign. [Trump won’t let her get away with Benghazi a la Romney in 2012] 3:00: In San Diego, California, Hillary Clinton wants to speak about a "smart and principled foreign policy" and the "choice at stake in this election. " She says it is a choice between a "fearful America" and a "strong, confident America. " [To show how both political establishments think and sound alike, Paul Ryan also uses "confident America. " Not as catchy as "Make America Great Again.] 2:15: Clinton gets Puerto Rico Governor’s endorsement. Sanders gets New Hampshire super delegate. 2:08: Interesting: Clinton campaign took out the   kiss from its foreign policy video: Clinton camp posted new "Trump doctrine" vid  —   no longer contains image of   kiss https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) June 2, 2016,  2:00: Would it be too much for the RNC to hire a    person every now and then?

He also says regulations and taxes will be better under a Trump administration. Malek, a graduate of West Point, says unlike Obama, says if Trump draws a line in the sand, "he means it. " He also says Trump is "strong enough to stand up to the despots of the world" and will lead from the front and not from behind like Obama.  But Malek points out that Trump needs to exert more discipline on the campaign trail and needs to stop taking two steps forward and then two steps back. Malek wrote a column this week in the Washington Post urging Trump to stop attacking fellow Republicans after Trump eviscerated New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, who has been harshly critical of Trump even though she owes her political career to former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin’s endorsement (many of Palin’s supporters are also Trump supporters). 1:05: CNN   Trump in chyron: Interesting use of the chyron (title graphic) by @CNN pic. twitter.   —   Anthony Rotolo (@rotolo) June 2, 2016,    1:00: Ahead of Clinton’s foreign policy address in which she will slam Trump, Trump cites Clinton’s foreign policy "monsters. " With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy experience, she has made so many mistakes  —   and I mean real monsters! No more HRC.  —   Donald J.
