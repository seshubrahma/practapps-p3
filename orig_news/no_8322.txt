Governor Dan Patrick who heads his Texas campaign.  Cruz opened his remarks by thanking the Texas audience. "God Bless the Lone Star State, and God Bless the great state of Oklahoma. " The senator said that "tonight, the voters have spoken. " He called on his fellow opponents to drop out and let him take on Trump by himself. He said his campaign is the only campaign that "has beaten and will beat Donald Trump’s. " He has now beat Trump in three races. He urged the candidates who have not yet won a state, or who have not yet won a significant number of delegates to drop out and join him on the stage. "Head to head, our campaign beats Donald Trump resoundingly. " The Texas senator went on to talk about his record as a proven conservative who has defended the Constitution. He said Trump will "expand Obamacare into socialized medicine. " He returned to his campaign promises for his first day in office and then blasted Trump for "funding the Gang of 8. " The senator then laid out a series of his differences with Mr. Trump. "I will never compromise on religious liberty. " He pledged to support the 2nd Amendment and to "stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel. " "Donald Trump has been part of the Washington corruption for 40 years," Cruz alleged.
