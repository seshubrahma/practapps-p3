It‚Äôs the Jews‚Äô fault in Germany,‚Äô" he pontificated, before adding ominously, "Charles Lindbergh led them. " "It is a term, as he defined it his way, but the words themselves carry very ugly echoes in our history," said Moran, serving notice the new President that he must carefully consider the psychotic delusions of paranoid ABC News reporters before choosing his every word. Apparently Trump can explain what he means a million times without exorcising the ghost of Charles Lindbergh from certain imaginations. This is an especially outrageous charge to level at Trump when his inauguration included the first benediction from an Orthodox rabbi ever, and the first Jewish prayer since Ronald Reagan‚Äôs second inaugural. Not only that, but Rabbi Marvin Hier is the head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. He‚Äôs probably a lot better than Terry Moran at detecting actual  . Trump‚Äôs daughter Ivanka converted to Orthodox Judaism before she was married to Jared Kushner in 2009. Trump declared himself "glad" about her decision in public. He‚Äôs also been very public about his support for Israel, including his intention to move the U. S. embassy to Jerusalem. His predecessor, Barack Obama, closed out his second term with a spectacular betrayal of Israel at the United Nations, winning loud applause from people openly pledged to murdering Jews. Did that make Terry Moran‚Äôs   detector twitch a bit?  People who listened to Trump‚Äôs speech probably found it a nice change of pace to have an American president who thinks the needs of the American people come first for a change, just as most other world leaders tend to work for the best interests of their respective nations.  While they were having these thoughts, squads of     were smashing windows, blocking traffic, and assaulting police officers across Washington, D. C. If they had Terry Moran‚Äôs finely tuned sense of historical irony, they‚Äôd have been wearing brown shirts instead of black. Moran didn‚Äôt invent this smear  ‚Äî   many other Trump critics have previously accused him of using "America first" language to send coded messages to   or of witlessly using the phrase without understanding its pedigree. Some of the same people think Trump deliberately quoted the Batman supervillain Bane in his inaugural speech. 4:26 PM: WATCH: Vandalized limo engulfed in flames, @jeffpeguescbs reports, as protesters and cops clash near parade route https:  .  pic. twitter.   ‚Äî   CBS News (@CBSNews) January 20, 2017,  Car set on fire! #Inauguration pic. twitter.   ‚Äî   Mike Cernovich üá∫üá∏ (@Cernovich) January 20, 2017,  There is a limo on fire at protests in downtown Washington. pic. twitter.   ‚Äî   Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) January 20, 2017,  Someone set the limo on fire. pic. twitter.   ‚Äî   Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) January 20, 2017,  Update: The K St. limo is on fire pic. twitter.   ‚Äî   Mark W.

A photo posted by Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) on Jan 20, 2017 at 12:31pm PST,  As House Oversight chairman, Chaffetz played a significant role in investigating Clinton following the revelation that she had used an unsecured private email server to save classified documents she came into contact with in her capacity as Secretary of State. Chaffetz has personally demanded an FBI investigation into Clinton, arguing that Clinton‚Äôs claim she was unaware of her breach of security protocol did not match the evidence the FBI had initially uncovered. Chaffetz was extremely critical of FBI director James Comey‚Äôs decision not to prosecute Clinton for her actions, and vowed to continue the investigation following Clinton‚Äôs defeat in the 2016 presidential election. Upon winning the presidency, President Donald Trump announced he would not seek to further investigate Clinton. "I‚Äôm not looking to go back through this," he told the New York Times.

"  President Trump‚Äôs predecessor Barack Obama famously refused to refer to groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State as "radical Islamic terrorists," claiming the term unfairly maligned Muslims who were not members of jihadist groups. The Washington Post notes that Trump‚Äôs inaugural address was also the first to use the words "urban" and "infrastructure," a nod to the core message of city repair and equality of opportunity in his speech. "Whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator," Trump told the crowd gathered in the heart of Washington, DC.

"The Trump Administration is committed to energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans and maximize the use of American resources, freeing us from dependence on foreign oil," the page reads. The page addresses finding economically viable energy solutions that are mindful of the environment: [O]ur need for energy must go    with responsible stewardship of the environment. Protecting clean air and clean water, conserving our natural habitats, and preserving our natural reserves and resources will remain a high priority.

Panel says he made a "big mistake" by not referring specifically to women. 12:58 PM: Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you. We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done. Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Today‚Äôs ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another  ‚Äî   but we are transferring power from Washington, D. C. and giving it back to you, the American People. For too long, a small group in our nation‚Äôs Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished  ‚Äî   but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered  ‚Äî   but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation‚Äôs Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes  ‚Äî   starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country. What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities   factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation  ‚Äî   and their pain is our pain.  Their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success.  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we‚Äôve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military, We‚Äôve defended other nation‚Äôs borders while refusing to defend our own, And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America‚Äôs infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We‚Äôve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world. But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it‚Äôs going to be America First. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body  ‚Äî   and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders.  We will bring back our wealth.  And we will bring back our dreams. We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work  ‚Äî   rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American. We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world  ‚Äî   but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones  ‚Äî   and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth. At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us, "how good and pleasant it is when God‚Äôs people live together in unity. " We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear  ‚Äî   we are protected, and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God. Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action  ‚Äî   constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done.  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions. It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator. So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together, We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Proud Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again.
