A successful first term for President Donald Trump could earn him huge support among minorities in the 2020 election, and also lock in   economic policies for the next two generations, says Trump’s top political consultant, Steve Bannon. ["If we deliver [on campaign promises] we’ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we’ll govern for 50 years," Bannon told The Hollywood Reporter on Nov. 15.  On Nov. 8, Trump won at least 8 percent of the   vote and at least 29 percent of the Latino vote.  The   policies pushed by Trump include trade and labor rules that help ordinary Americans instead of global businesses and their Wall Street investors. "I’m a nationalist. I’m an economic nationalist," he told the interviewer. "I’m not a white nationalist. " Under policies endorsed by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, "the globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia," he said. "The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f —  ed over," he said.  Before he is inaugurated on Jan. 20, Trump has forced President Barack Obama and the GOP’s business wing to abandon the   Partnership trade deal. If it had been approved, it would have moved U. S. factory jobs to Asia, moved Asian service workers into U. S. workplaces, and subordinated U. S. laws to an international tribunal. Read it all here.
