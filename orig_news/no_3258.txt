But he added Congress also be giving him the funding to build the wall as well.  "We have already authorized this, meaning the law was passed almost 10 years ago," Ryan said. "And then we will give the financing to Secretary Kelly and the border security plan. So, it’s really up to them as to how fast they can execute this policy. I think that’s great.
