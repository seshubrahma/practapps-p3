He says he has embraced the victims of illegal immigrant crime and says they were victimized because of people who should have never been in the country in the first place. Trump says he has seen our dilapidated airports and bridges and he says it is "hard to imagine what has happened to our country. " He says America is being "auctioned off to the highest bidder" and "we’re broke" while "our infrastructure is a disaster. " He says our schools are failing while crime is rising. He says the last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House and the "extension of the Obama disaster. " 9:15: Trump: The Clintons have turned "politics of personal enrichment into an art form. " Trump says he will give a speech next week detailing all of the corruption associated with the Clintons. He says Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her "private hedge fund.

Weaver punts a bit when asked why super delegates should go against the will of the Dem. electorate.

Brian Sandoval jumps in, saying that he can’t defend the "indefensible" and "cannot at this time" say that he can vote for Trump. 4:10: An Iowa State GOP Senator suspended his party membership to protest Trump’s "racist remarks. " 4:08: Team Sanders is defiant, and they may be more so if they pull out a win in California later tonight. 4:05: Trump says he will not comment on the Trump University case any further and states that his "comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. " It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard. I do not feel that one’s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial. Over the past few weeks, I have watched as the media has reported one inaccuracy after another concerning the ongoing litigation involving Trump University. There are several important facts the public should know and that the media has failed to report. Throughout the litigation my attorneys have continually demonstrated that students who participated in Trump University were provided a substantive, valuable education based upon a curriculum developed by professors from Northwestern University, Columbia Business School, Stanford University and other respected institutions. And, the response from students was overwhelming. Over a five year period, more than 10, 000 paying students filled out surveys giving the courses high marks and expressing their overwhelming satisfaction with Trump University’s programs. For example: Former student Tarla Makaeff, the original plaintiff in the litigation, not only completed multiple surveys rating Trump University’s   seminar "excellent" in every category, but also praised Trump University’s mentorship program in a glowing 5 plus minute video testimonial. When asked "how could Trump University help to meet [her] goals" she simply stated "[c]ontinue to offer great classes. " Once the plaintiffs’ lawyers realized how disastrous a witness she was, they asked to have her removed from the case. Over my lawyers’ objections, the judge granted the plaintiffs’ motion, but allowed the case to continue. Art Cohen, a lead plaintiffs in the litigation, completed a survey in which he not only rated Trump University’s   seminar "excellent" in virtually every category, but went so far as to indicate that he would "attend another Trump University seminar" and even "recommend Trump University seminars to a friend. " When asked how Trump University could improve the seminar, Mr. Cohen’s only suggestion was to "[h]ave lunch sandwiches brought in" and make the lunch break 45 minutes. Former student Bob Giullo, who has been critical of Trump University in numerous interviews and negative  from my political opponents, also expressed his satisfaction, rating Trump University’s programs "excellent" in every category. When asked how Trump University could improve its programs, Mr. Giullo simply asked that students be provided "more comfortable chairs. " Indeed, these are just a few of literally thousands of positive surveys, all of which can be viewed online at www. 98percentapproval. com. For those students who decided that Trump University’s programs were not for them, the company had a generous refund policy, offering a full refund to any student who asked for their money back within 3 days of signing up for a program or by the end of the first day of any   program, whichever came later. Normally, legal issues in a civil case would be heard in a neutral environment. However, given my unique circumstances as nominee of the Republican Party and the core issues of my campaign that focus on illegal immigration, jobs and unfair trade, I have concerns as to my ability to receive a fair trial. I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies  —   like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier  —   are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage. Due to what I believe are unfair and mistaken rulings in this case and the Judge’s reported associations with certain professional organizations, questions were raised regarding the Obama appointed Judge’s impartiality. It is a fair question. I hope it is not the case. While this lawsuit should have been dismissed, it is now scheduled for trial in November. I do not intend to comment on this matter any further. With all of the thousands of people who have given the courses such high marks and accolades, we will win this case!   4:00: Just when it seemed like Democrats had all of the chaos on their side, establishment Republicans and the "Never Trump" Smart Set seized on Trump’s attacks on Federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel to 1) grandstand in order to get the affection of the mainstream media and the Beltway elite and 2) again float the possibility of denying Trump the nomination at the GOP convention. House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) called Trump’s remarks about Judge Curiel the "textbook definition of racism" while Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) said they were " " and added that "if anybody was looking for an   this is probably it. " Establishment Republican Sen. Mark Kirk ( ) took back his endorsement and Tweeted that Trump does not have the temperament to command the country’s nuclear arsenal. Given my military experience, Donald Trump does not have the temperament to command our military or our nuclear arsenal.  —   Mark Kirk (@MarkKirk) June 7, 2016,  The former chair of the Iowa GOP Tweeted that the GOP needs someone to step up to wrest the nomination away from Trump, a sentiment that is being echoed by the "Never Trump" Smart Set inside the Beltway.
