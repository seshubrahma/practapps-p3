NEW YORK  —     Donald Trump is meeting with his top aides to plan for his upcoming administration. [The NYPD and Secret Service have turned Trump Tower into a fortress for the president elect, as it appears to be the focal point of presidential activity for the next few days.  Formal concrete blockades and steel barricades have replaced the cement and sanitation trucks that were used by the NYPD for a  temporary barricade. Trump fans and haters alike have gathered across the street to watch the building. "Busy day planned in New York," Trump wrote on Twitter. "Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!" At Trump Tower, Trump campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon was spotted entering the building as well as Deputy campaign manager David Bossie. Trump’s spokeswoman Hope Hicks also went in, as did Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Rudy Giuliani went in. He’s a   surrogate who’s expected to have a large role in the Trump administration. At this point, Trump and his team have made no official announcements about who will be working in his administration. But that hasn’t stopped the media from speculating about various people within Trump’s orbit. Reports suggest that Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( ) has been considered for Treasury Secretary, Rep. Mike McCaul ( ) has been floated for Homeland Security Secretary. New York Magazine, CNN, and the New York Times reported that Trump is considering Bannon to serve as his chief of staff although no announcements have been made.
