" Cruz also added, "This November, it is critical we elect conservatives up and down the ballot in order to prevent a liberal takeover of Washington D. C. " He emphasized, "But our opponents are already making plans to defeat us, so we cannot afford to wait to engage until 2018. " Senator Cruz said "Everyday in the Senate, I have continued fighting for jobs, freedom, and the security of 27 million Texans and all Americans across this great country.
