Washington (CNN) Republican leadership this week revealed its plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The proposal, backed by President Donald Trump, Speaker Paul Ryan and others, met swift opposition from conservative corners as well as major players within the health care space. Some, like the conservative Association of Mature American Citizens and the American Action Network, have praised the bill, but many other key interest groups and industry stakeholders have expressed concerns with the bill as written. Asked about opposition from major groups, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said at his Wednesday press briefing that this bill was " " and offered less to special interest groups than Obamacare had.

Among them is Heritage Action, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, widely regarded as one of the most important voices within Republican policy. The Heritage Foundation’s leader, former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, has praised the Trump administration heavily, and the organization played a role in Trump’s transition to the presidency. Speaker Ryan, however, defended the bill on Wednesday from conservative criticism, calling it a "conservative wish list." Trump, meanwhile, huddled with members of some conservative groups opposed to the bill on Wednesday evening.
