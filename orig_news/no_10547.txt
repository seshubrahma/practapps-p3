A new   national poll shows Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by one point  —   and over half of likely voters saying they believe she has broken the law. [From McClatchy DC:  WASHINGTON —  A majority of voters believe Hillary Clinton has done something illegal, according to a new   Poll days before the presidential election. A total of 83 percent of likely voters believe that Clinton did something wrong  —   51 percent saying she did something illegal and 32 percent saying she something unethical but not illegal. Just 14 percent said she’s done nothing wrong. By comparison, 79 percent think Donald Trump did something wrong, though not nearly as many think he did something illegal. Just 26 percent think he’s done something illegal, while 53 percent think he’s dome something unethical but not illegal. Just 17 percent think he’s done nothing wrong. The deep suspicion of Clinton is likely a top reason she’s lost much of her lead and the race for the White House has tightened in the race’s closing days. In a   race, the two are neck and neck with Clinton supported by 44 percent and Trump by 43 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson has 6 percent, and the Green Party’s Jill Stein has 2 percent. In a   match up, Clinton has 46 percent, Trump 44 percent. Read the rest of the story here.
