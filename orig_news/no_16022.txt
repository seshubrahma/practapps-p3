 (CNN) Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Sunday the Donald Trump campaign had not yet reached out to him about joining the ticket. Many have pointed Gingrich, who ran for president in 2012, as a potential running mate for the Republican presumptive nominee. The former speaker himself has not been shy about his interest in the spot. But according to his comments on "Fox News Sunday," Trump hasn’t come close to approaching him about it. "Nobody’s called me. Nobody has said, ’Would you like to be?’ Nobody has said, ’Would you be willing to be considered?’ Nobody has said anything," Gingrich said. Corker on Trump: Scotland ’one of his best events’ Gingrich said the lack of contact about the vice presidency was not a sign he was out of contention. The Georgia Republican said he thinks Trump will not decide on a running mate until right before the party’s nominating convention.  "(Trump’s) probably going to start thinking about it about two days before Cleveland," Gingrich said. "I think that Donald Trump does not want to make a decision until the convention." When the time comes for Trump to decide, Gingrich said the vetting process in his case would be simple because of how long he has been in the public eye.  "In the case of a few of us, there’s not much vetting to do," Gingrich said. "It’s all out there. All you’ve got to do is Google."
