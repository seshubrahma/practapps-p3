Latin pop singer Prince Royce sang "Happy Birthday" to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday during her appearance on Univisionâ€™s   talk show El Gordo Y La Flaca. [Clinton, who turned 69 on Wednesday, was also treated to a performance by a full mariachi band during her appearance on the program.  "What gets better than this? I get Prince Royce to give me a hug, I get a mariachi band to play for me and I get to be here with you guys. It doesnâ€™t get any better than this" Clinton said, according to Billboard, in a Facebook Live video that has been deleted.  Prince Royce has guest starred this season on Huluâ€™s TV drama East Los High to encourage Hispanic millennials to vote in the upcoming election. After singing "Happy Birthday," the Latin   singer formally endorsed Clintonâ€™s candidacy. "I want to motivate everyone to go out and I want Hillary to know that she has my support and that I love her very much," he said Tuesday. Royce also shared a selfie of himself alongside Clinton with his 6 million Twitter followers.

Last year, Anthony brought Clinton onstage during his Miami concert. Lopez is currently   a   "Love Trumps Hate" concert series in support of Clintonâ€™s campaign. Oddly enough, Clinton was serenaded with an impromptu "Happy Birthday" song by a crowd of supporters in Coconut Creek, Florida earlier this week.
