â€™  â€™ â€™   Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBCâ€™â€™s "Morning Joe," lashed out on   Twitter on Sunday night into Monday after an incoming New York   Times reporter posted that television personality "partied" with     Donald Trump at his pomp    New Yearâ€™â€™s   Eve bash. â€™ â€™   Scarborough, the former Republican congressman, lambasted the   reporter, Sopan Deb, for pushing what he called "fake news" and   for "making up facts." â€™ â€™   Scarborough insisted he was only at the event for a brief amount   of time before it began. He said he was attempting to set up an   interview with Trump. Scarborough and his cohost Mike Brzezinski   have come under fire repeatedly for what many in media believe is   a  with the    . â€™ â€™   Deb, who had covered Trump on the trail for CBS News, had   originally posted a screenshot from  detailing the New Yearâ€™â€™s Eve gala. Haberman wrote   that the hosts were in attendance, but did not categorize   their appearance as having "partied" with Trump. â€™ â€™ â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tMorning Joeâ€™s hosts partied with Trump last night at   . Last year, Trump publicly thanked them for support.   " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tPartied? Youâ€™re very good at pushing fake news. You should write for CNN. Apparently making up facts is fine if youâ€™re writing about us.  " â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tLast year, Trump publicly thanked David Axelrod for his support. Stop being such a hack.  â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tOne of the more entertaining aspects of media coverage of media is how so many who blast Trump for half truths attack us with half truths.  â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tLast year I said Trumpâ€™s campaign was racist, xenophobic and disqualifying. But be snide while making facts up. Partied? Not even close.  " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tYeah. Iâ€™m tired of hacks attacking politicians for lies and false narratives and then doing the same to us.  " â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tDoes  know that you just make shit up on your twitter feed?  â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tWow. He says he chases Trump for CBS. You mean he even lies on his Twitter bio? Iâ€™m not surprised.  " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tYouâ€™re defending a guy who lied about me and youâ€™re telling me to be careful? I think you have that backwards. You be careful. Facts matter.  " â€™ â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tAgreed! Facts matter: so you werenâ€™t at    on New Years Eve? You called it fake news, so letâ€™s get this right.  " â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tI imagine you repeated that last night at    . Before the ball dropped, maybe even.  â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t1. I "partied" last night by watching Groundhog Day and Ghostbusters with my kids. Then watched the Mariah Carey dumpster fire. â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t2. Around 7pm, I had a preset meeting with PEOTUS before his party trying to set up an interview (much like reporters at CBS & NYT do. â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t3. The event was black tie. Both Mika and I were in casual clothes, did not attend the party, and left before any "partying" began. â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t4. Nothing that Mika and I did in setting up this meeting was any different than what all good reporters and news hosts try to do daily. â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t5. Anyone suggesting otherwise is a hypocrite who ignores what great journalists from Ben Bradlee to Tom Brokaw have done for years. â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t6. I hope we get the interview. â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t7. Stop lying about us. â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t8. Happy New YearðŸŽ‰â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tI canâ€™t think of a presidential candidate who thanked Brokaw and Bradlee for their support, but Iâ€™m just a liar who makes up news.  " â€™   An enraged Scarborough continued to take aim at Deb, posting a   roughly 20 tweets subsequently throughout Sunday. Some took issue   with Deb. Others took aim at those siding with the CBS News   reporter, such as Brian Fallon, the former campaign spokesman for   Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. And   more were posted to further his defense of attending the   event, which he claimed was only for an extremely brief period   and while he was wearing street clothes. â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tSo you double down when you get caught in a lie. How. ..interesting.  â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tYes. You lied. And you are digging a deeper whole. Trump also thanked Axelrod. Stop. Digging. Youâ€™re embarrassing yourself.  " â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tIn street clothes. We made the radical decision to follow the path provided by the Secret Service. The pic was in front of metal detectors.  â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tYeah. If you define a national treasure as someone who likes lying about others.  â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tI donâ€™â€™t know about you, but journalists I know "show up" when the scheduler sets the time. It stops one from being restrained by the USSS.  â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tHowâ€™s Wisconsin in the fall? Oh wait. Never mind.  " â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tBtw, my issue is not with your story. Itâ€™â€™s with the mischaracterization of it by someone else that we were "partying." All good.  â€™ â€™   On Monday, Haberman posted a photo of Scarborough from the event   along with other photos she had received. This   prompted Scarborough to continue his lengthy tweetstorm on   the subject. He continued taking shots at Deb and other prominent   reporters. â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tMore  â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tThis sure looks like an ideal location to have a journalistic meeting about an interview on NYE, . Look forward to seeing the result.  â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tGreat journalistic work on your part. This is critical to America and the world. Iâ€™â€™m "behind a wine glass" for 30 seconds. Good God!  â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tMore: Maggie Haberman did not try to contact me before putting me in a story saying I was a "reveler" at Trumpâ€™â€™s NYE party. I was not.  â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tSeveral reporters said you shouldâ€™â€™ve called to confirm I was a "reveler" at a party I did not attend, was not invited to & not dressed for.  â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tI do have an issue with one NYT reporter painting me in a false light without calling me, & a future NYT reporter adding another false fact.  â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tPick. Up. The. Phone. And. Ask. Iâ€™m went where the USSS directed me to the foot of the stairs. Iâ€™m standing with the PEOTUS going upstairs.  " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tSomeone showed you a picture. You email and text me when you have questions. You shouldâ€™ve done it in this situation and checked your story.  " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tOh, youâ€™re back. Whatâ€™s your lie of the day?  " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tYou get caught lying then double down and triple down. You know the truth and yet you just canâ€™t stop sending out snide tweets. Wow.  " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tIs this what Bill Clinton meant when he said weâ€™re in a   world?  " â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tFacts are stubborn things. â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™   Haberman asked Scarborough in her own series of tweets about what   had changed since the night before, when he suggested he was   fine with her story. She also said itâ€™â€™s "known" that Scarborough   and Trump have a relationship. â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™  I ask again   what changed since last night when you were fine with it? â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™  you had no issue with the description last night or the story. Your issue was with Sopan. What changed? â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™  There is one person turning this into a thing and it isnâ€™â€™t me. As I noted last night, "partied" was not my word. â€™tâ€™tâ€™ "  Youâ€™re in a photo standing among revelers. Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s inaccurate. I also didnâ€™t and donâ€™t think itâ€™s a big deal. â€™tâ€™t" "   and for record, I still donâ€™t think this is a big deal. Heâ€™s got a relationship with Trump and itâ€™s known. â€™tâ€™t"
