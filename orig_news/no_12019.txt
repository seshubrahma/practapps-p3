Overflow crowds in Peoria greeted 2016 presidential candidate Ted Cruz on his third of five Monday rallies in Illinois the day before Tuesday’s pivotal primary elections. [Cruz commented that republican frontrunner Donald Trump "may be the one person on the face of the planet Hillary Clinton can beat in a general election" according to political reporter Rosie Gray.  Cruz mentioned Cook County politics, garnering boos from the crowd in reference to Chicago, Illinois. He slammed Trump over donations to politicians such as the disgraced and imprisoned Rod Blagojevich, the Cook County Democratic Party, and Rahm Emmanuel. "Rod Blagojevich!  …    The Cook County Democratic Party!  …    Rahm Emanuel!" Ted Cruz is reminding Peoria, IL, voters of past Trump donations.  —   Matt Flegenheimer (@mattfleg) March 14, 2016,  Journal Star reporter Chris Kaergard recounted Cruz’s comments comparing himself to former President Ronald Reagan in telling the crowd how he will treat the military in contrast to President Obama, whom he compared to former President Jimmy Carter. Cruz’s key message, according to Kaergard, was that he is the only candidate that can beat Trump and then Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the fall. Cruz also hit on the three key issues of jobs, freedom, and security. In dealing with one protester, Cruz said to be respectful. Texas Tribune reporter Patrick Svitek posted that the protester repeatedly told Cruz to go back to Canada and waved a Trump sign as he was escorted from the venue. Cruz seized the opportunity to try to differentiate himself from Trump saying, according to this post: Cruz says to heckler, "One difference between here and a Donald Trump rally is I’m not asking anyone to punch you in the face."  —   Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) March 14, 2016,  Rally attendee VK posted online of the Cruz crowd: "The crowd never sat down for 40 minutes.
