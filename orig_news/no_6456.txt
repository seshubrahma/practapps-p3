On March 25, in the wake of the failure of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) President Trump tweeted a warning and a prediction: "ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE.  Do not worry! "[In the first part of this series, we considered Trump’s warning: The question of whether or not Obamacare will "explode. "  And our tentative answer was that the national political system, almost certainly, will seek to prevent, or at least contain, any such explosion.   Okay, so now let’s turn to Trump’s prediction that "we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for the people. "   Trump has, indeed, made some bold promises about his healthcare plan.  He has said, for example, that it will be "much less expensive and much better. " And if the failed AHCA fell far short of those aspirations, well, Trump can point out that it really wasn’t his bill it was the House Republicans’: As he said in the Oval Office on March 24, after AHCA went down, "There were things in this bill I didn’t particularly like. "  And as for his own future signature effort on healthcare, if and when that comes, he said, "I’ll tell you what’s going to come out of it is a better bill. "
