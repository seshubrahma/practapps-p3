(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.   Donald  Trump’s latest stop on his victory tour was a rally in Des Moines. The event came a day after tapping Iowa’s governor, Terry Branstad, to be ambassador to China. Mr. Trump is facing criticism for lashing out at an Indiana union local president who accused Mr. Trump of lying about saving jobs at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis. _____ 2. Mr. Trump  named Andrew Puzder, above, a   executive and critic of the minimum wage, as his choice for labor secretary. Democrats are promising a thorough vetting process of the candidates Mr. Trump has nominated for cabinet positions  —   like that of Scott Pruitt, an ally of the fossil fuel industry, to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Here’s a look at what a Trump administration could do to influence climate change. _____ 3. "This is all uncharted territory. " That’s the feeling in America’s auto industry, which expects to be reshaped by the Trump administration. A chief concern is Mr. Trump’s threat of tariffs on the millions of vehicles sold in the U. S. each year that were built in Japan, Korea and other countries. _____ 4. John Glenn, above center, who was hailed as a national hero after becoming the first American to orbit Earth, died on Thursday. He was 95. Mr. Glenn also had a   career as a U. S. Senator from Ohio. In his final Senate term, he got his wish to return to orbit and, at 77 years old, was the oldest person to go into space. _____ 5. South Korean lawmakers are expected to vote on Friday on a motion to impeach President Park   over a corruption scandal. Here are the accusations against her. As the protests against her have grown, Ms. Park has mostly dropped from public view, appearing only to make televised apologies. "My heart is crushed," she said in one. Most Koreans say Ms. Park brought the disgrace on herself, but in some cities, she is seen as an innocent victim of a scandal. _____ 6. President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has signed a wave of oil deals with Asian and European energy companies in recent weeks. "Our officials are in a rush to sign contracts with big oil companies in order to have leverage when Trump enters the White House," said an economist with close ties to the government. _____ 7. A watchdog group in Britain said it found hundreds of accusations of police sexual abuse in England and Wales over the two years through the end of March. Among those targeted were victims of domestic abuse, drug and alcohol addicts and people who work in the sex industry. _____ 8. When 36 people died in an inferno at a converted warehouse in Oakland, Calif. last week, we deployed a team of journalists to investigate it and document the stories of a community reeling from the country’s worst structural fire in a decade. Instead of revealing our findings in an article at the end of our reporting, we’ll be telling you what we learn as we learn it. Email us at oaklandfire@nytimes. com if you have suggestions on what we should explore. _____ 9. The world’s tallest land animal is on the verge of extinction. The giraffe population has declined by 40 percent over the past 30 years, according to a new report by an international monitoring group. Illegal hunting and the loss of habitat are being blamed. _____ 10. Finally, we told you yesterday about our film critics’ favorite movies of the year. Now, let’s review the year’s great performers  —   in movies, at least. Among those featured in our magazine’s newest issue: Emma Stone, Ruth Negga, above, Viola Davis, Denzel Washington, Don Cheadle. "I love the movie magic of no longer seeing an actor  —   or especially a star  —   but a person," said one of our critics. Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
