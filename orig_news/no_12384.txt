The Root’s political editor Jason Johnson appeared on MSNBC Saturday to discuss the 2016 presidential race.  Johnson said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton "would never" risk losing out on the White House by having a   ticket. "I think when Hillary met with Elizabeth Warren in early 2015 she Jedi mind tricked her, convinced her not to join the race," Johnson stated. "She would never run the risk of having two women on the ticket and giving the White House to Donald Trump. She’s going to pick a white male from the Midwest.
