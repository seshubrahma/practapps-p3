Keith Ellison ( ) were among the Democratic leaders who remained seated during the second emotional    standing ovation for Carryn Owens, though they did stand for her introduction.  While Democratic congressional leaders were reluctant to show respect during the speech, former Obama adviser Van Jones had a different take on the moment, calling it "one of the most extraordinary moments" of American politics. Trump’s speech was   by the American public and media outlets normally adversarial towards the president. A   poll showed that 69 percent of American viewers felt "optimistic" about the country after the speech, while 28 percent felt "pessimistic" after the speech. The Washington Post called Trump’s speech the "best ‘big’ speech" from the president.
