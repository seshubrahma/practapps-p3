Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton defended Barron Trump after angry leftists started making fun of President Donald Trump’s youngest child during the inauguration. ["Barron Trump deserves the chance every child   be a kid," Clinton wrote on Twitter.  In the same message, however, Clinton urged leftists to oppose Barron’s father for his policies. "Standing up for every kid also means opposing @POTUS policies that hurt kids," she said: Leave Barron alone! pic. twitter.   —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) January 23, 2017,
