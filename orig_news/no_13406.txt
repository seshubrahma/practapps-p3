Talk radio host Mark Levin said that the Drudge Report and Breitbart "have put their finger on the scales, I believe, for Trump" on Tuesday.  Levin began by stating that "30 days ago, [GOP presidential candidate Sen.] Ted Cruz ( ) was considered the most   conservative in the race. Donald Trump was considered an   businessman who could get things done.   …     Now today, if you listen to the rhetoric, Ted Cruz is bought and paid for by banks. He’s Canadian. And he’s not terribly conservative. Oh, and he’s nasty. Donald Trump, is the most conservative in the field, and he’s changing the conservative movement, and so forth and so on. " Levin said that he doesn’t think Trump getting an endorsement from former Governor Sarah Palin ( ) will make much of a difference because voters seem to be "kind of dug in. " He then argued, "It’s [the Palin endorsement] being pumped up heavily on the Drudge Report and Breitbart, which have put their finger on the scales, I believe, for Trump. And they have every right to do that. People say I put the finger on the scales for Cruz. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
