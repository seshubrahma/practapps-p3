’  ’ "   Sen. John McCain of Arizona released a statement Thursday   rebuking President Donald Trump’s contentious phone call . " ’   During the call, Trump called a refugee agreement with the nation   the "worst deal ever" and accused Australian Prime Minister   Malcolm Turnbull of trying to send America the "next Boston   bombers" under a deal to send refugees from Australia to the US. ’ "   McCain said he called Australia’s ambassador to the US, Joe   Hockey, on Thursday morning to reassure him of US support.
