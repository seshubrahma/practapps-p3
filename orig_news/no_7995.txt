Sunday on CNN’s "State of the Union," Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s son Donald Trump, Jr. said Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) can only win the Republican presidential nomination by "bribing the delegates. "  While discussing the delegate system, Trump said, "I think we’re going to do what we need to do at a point. We want to win without having to do that. You know Ted Cruz has no chance of winning this without bribing the delegates. That’s his game at this point. He’s mathematically eliminated but that’s his from day one he’s not appealing to the voters. He’ll lose more states than Mitt Romney. I can’t name a single state that Mitt lost that Ted can possibly win. So I think at this point the Republican establishment would much rather just hand the things over to Hillary, hand the reins over to her and let her run it. Guess what? There’s no accountability in the party. You lose, it doesn’t matter. You win, okay, great, you win. because everyone’s in on the same thing. all their job is to do is to protect the little cliques they formed to keep the paychecks rolling from special interests and the same thing with the delegate process we’re seeing today.
