[The New York Times] • Russian spies tried in 2013 to recruit a businessman who is now a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign  —   and part of the F. B. I. investigation into Russia’s interference into the U. S. election. [The New York Times] • The Dutch Supreme Court has approved the extradition to Canada of a convicted cyberbully who faces charges in the case of a Canadian teenager who killed herself after being bullied online.

[The New York Times] • North Korea tested a missile only a day before President Xi Jinping of China was set to arrive in the U. S. for talks with President Trump. [The New York Times] • "It’s impossible to know what to get Your Holiness!"  —   That was Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, speaking to Pope Francis in Rome as he handed the pontiff a picnic basket full of tea and chocolate. [Associated Press] • The best way to get more done may be to spend more time doing less. • Beginning a new exercise regimen, but gaining weight?

Good luck persuading people as pressed as your Briefing reporter. Even a schoolchild can tell you that matter can exist as a solid, a liquid or a gas. But humanity’s hope for   clean energy may hinge on a fourth state: plasma. A giant plant now under construction in the south of France will be the testing ground, if the project’s partners  —   which include the European Union, the U. S. Russia and China  —   stay on course for billions of dollars of investment and a couple of decades of painstaking work. The kind of plasma we’re talking about was named by an American scientist, Irving Langmuir, who saw a resemblance to blood plasma. It emerges when energy is added to gas, leaving a cloud of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons zipping around. That’s what makes up the sun and other stars. Under the right conditions, some superheated ions can fuse. And as they join, they shed a tiny amount of mass that translates into vast amounts of energy. Hence all that heat and light from the sun. The French plant aims to create the right conditions by using magnetic fields to contain the plasma and radio waves and microwaves to make it unimaginably hot  —   and then see if   fusion will work.
