Thursday at a news conference in Bismarck, ND, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump commented on the State Department inspector general’s report that found Hillary Clinton violated the agency rules by using a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Trump called the report "devastating," and added, "This was all bad judgment. "  Trump said, "I want to run against her. Look, she has bad judgment. This was all bad judgment. Probably illegal. We’ll have to find out what the FBI says about it. But certainly it was bad judgment. I just read the report. It’s devastating, the report  —   it’s devastating. There’s no reason for it. It’s just skirting on the edge all the time. You look back at her history, and this is her history. It’s a very, very harsh report. Done really by Democrats, if you think of it, appointed by Obama and done by Democrats. It’s shocking to see it. It’s shocking to see what she did. Really, more than anything else, it’s bad judgment. That’s going to be up to her whether or not she wants to continue running. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
