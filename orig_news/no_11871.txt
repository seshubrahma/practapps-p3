On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s "Real Time," host Bill Maher wondered if it was possible to be a good person and still support GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.  Maher said, "The people of Idaho, Wyoming, Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Kentucky, I know they’re Republican, mostly, but they’re human, right? These are human beings? What the f*ck does it take, in this country, to have being a human being supersede being a Republican?" After former Senator Bob Kerrey ( ) stated that there are good people who are supporting Trump, Maher asked, "Can you at this point?" After Kerrey argued that you could, Maher stated, "I don’t get that. " He added, "If the basket fits. Well, if you’re deplorable  —   I mean, if you have deplorable beliefs, you’re deplorable.
