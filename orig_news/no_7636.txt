Thursday on Fox News Channel’s "Hannity," former House Speaker Newt Gingrich doubled down on a claim he had made earlier in the day regarding some in the GOP abandoning either of the leading two Republican presidential contenders, Donald Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz ( ).  Gingrich warned that by not falling in line behind Trump or Cruz is effectively supporting Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton. "Let’s be honest, if you want to help elect Hillary Clinton, then help elect Hillary Clinton and a radical Supreme Court, but don’t give us any pious baloney that you’re gonna be for some virtuous middle way," he said. "There’s no virtuous middle way here  —   you’re either for the Republican nominee, whether it’s Trump or Cruz, or you’re for the election of Hillary Clinton," he added. "There is no middle ground here. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor,
