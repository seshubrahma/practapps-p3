Tuesday evening in Los Angeles at the   Democratic Club, while discussing President Donald Trump’s budget, Rep. Maxine Waters ( ) said she hoped Trump is impeached so he cannot build a wall on the U. S.  border.  Waters said, "We are in church you all. We have got to do what God would have us do. And I believe we are the kind of people that would do that. So I’m hoping and praying the wall will never be built and if we impeach him we know it is not going to get built. " (  WFB) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
