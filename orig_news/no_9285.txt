.@THEHermanCain: The   movement is insanely delusional and should be blamed if Clinton wins the presidency. https:  .  Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends," talk show host Herman Cain, a candidate for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, dismissed the   "Stop Trump" movement and argued that if the effort to stop Trump continues, it could break up the GOP and lead to a Hillary Clinton presidency.  "The   movement  —   they are still insanely delusional that they can stop Trump," Cain said. "The voice of the people is being heard. You can’t come back now and say, ‘OK, I don’t like Trump so I’m not going to get behind the nominee. I think that is foolish and if they break up the Republican Party by continuing to push back, they will be responsible for a Hillary presidency, not the people screaming that they want a leader, a winner and a fighter.
