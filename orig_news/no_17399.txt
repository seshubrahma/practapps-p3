Washington (CNN) More than half of Americans say they’re bothered by Russian hacks of Democratic emails in an effort to help Donald Trump win the election, a new NBC   Street Journal poll shows.    percent of Americans say they are at least quite a bit concerned about the Russian hacks, the poll shows. There is a sharp partisan divide, with 86% of Democrats saying they are concerned compared with 29% of Republicans. However, most Americans do not believe Russian hacking influenced the outcome of the election.  Just 37% say they believe Russian hacking helped Trump defeat Hillary Clinton, while 57% say they think it had no impact.  Broadly, at 31% more Americans said Trump is "too friendly" toward Russian President Vladimir Putin than the 24% who said he’s "not too friendly." Another 44% had no opinion.  And about 50% of Americans said they approved of Trump’s handling of the transition, while 41% disapprove, the survey shows. That approval number is significantly below President Barack Obama’s in 2008 (73%) and Bill Clinton’s in 1992 (77%).  The poll of 1, 000 adults was conducted December   and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3. 1 percentage points.
