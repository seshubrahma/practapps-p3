On this day in 1917, the First World War was entrenched in some of its darkest days. The Allies were in a stalemate on the Western Front, and good news was in short supply. So it was a huge morale booster for the Allies when Turkish forces surrendered the holy city of Jerusalem to Britain’s Gen. Edmund Allenby. Prime Minister David Lloyd George called it "a Christmas present for the British people. " The New York Herald’s front page proclaimed: "Jerusalem is rescued by British after 673 years of Moslem Rule. " Jews in the city, inspired a month earlier by Britain’s Balfour Declaration in support of a Jewish homeland, rejoiced. Some Arabs, many of whom had been conscripted by the Ottomans, danced in the streets. Two more details: When General Allenby entered the Old City, he did so on foot and unfurled no flags, in a sign of respect. He also deployed Muslim troops to ease sectarian tension. Until he arrived, the mayor of Jerusalem had been scrambling to find a British official to whom he could cede control. An army cook who got lost while looking for food was initially asked. He declined, saying "I don’t want the city I want eggs. " _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings. What would you like to see here? Contact us at asiabriefing@nytimes. com.
