Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump tells supporters at a fundraiser for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, "Who the hell cares if there’s a trade war?" with China. ["Here’s my trade deal," Trump began. "My trade deal is very simple   …     I am going to make great deals for this country. That’s my trade deal. "  "You can call it free trade  …    you can do whatever you want to call it," he added. "It may be free, it may not be free. " "Who the hell cares if there’s a trade war?" Trump questioned, adding that the U. S. has a "$500 billion [trade deficit with China] and they’re telling me about a trade war. " "China will behave and China will be our friend," Trump said  —   once he’s president. "They’re going to respect our country again. "
