Monday at a rally in Iowa for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Sarah Palin said Rep. Steve King ( ) must be "huffing ethanol" for suggesting today on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" that Trump had bought her endorsement.  King said earlier, "There aren’t very many people who have been able to say no to Donald Trump. He has a massive amount of assets and resources that he can deploy when it comes time to convince someone. That has to impact how people think. " Responding to King, Palin said  "He is accusing me on MSNBC  —   first, MSNBC, really  —   of selling my support to Mr. Trump. And this is why  —   when you read things like this  —   this is why people don’t like politics, they know that it’s a dirty business because people will say things they know are untrue. But why would a good conservative guy like Steve King, from the heartland of America,  want to say something that he knows isn’t true?  That just doesn’t sound like the heartland of America. Maybe he’s forgotten some of his heart in the heartland, got a touch of that Potomac Fever there in D. C. Maybe he’s been  —   I don’t know  —   maybe he’s been hanging out in a corn field too long, huffing ethanol or something, because his accusations here are way off base.
