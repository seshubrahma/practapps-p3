 (CNN)"Family Guy" creator Seth MacFarlane has a theory on why a bunch of people in Hollywood can’t get on board with the idea of   Donald Trump.  "Wanna know why Hollywood folks hate Trump?" he wrote in a note posted to social media. "We live and work amongst his kind every day out here."  McFarlane, also the creator of "American Dad," went on to say Trump uses tactics "employed by the shiftiest of agents, lawyers and publicists."  "We’ve learned to recognize the blustery showmanship of a lying con man because we encounter it every day in our business," he wrote. "We’ve learned to smell it because it’s bitten so many of us in the   ." MacFarlane has been a longtime critic of Trump. "Family Guy" even used a Trump gag in its Emmy campaign earlier this year. In the poster, Peter Griffin was seen with   skin and a tagline that read: "As long as we’re voting for dumb loudmouths, can I get an Emmy?" "Most of us love America a hell of a lot and we don’t want America to be conned the way many of us have ourselves," MacFarlane added. "Trump is not of the People. Trump is of Hollywood. And that’s the problem."
