A new study by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) reveals savings created by reducing illegal immigration through an effective border wall could save taxpayers $64 billion over the next ten years. [Even a small reduction in the numbers of illegal border crossings could save enough money to pay for the estimated $12 to $15 billion cost of building the wall promised by President Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. The conclusions of the analysis by CIS’ Director of Research Dr. Steven Camarota are based on fiscal estimated developed by the Naional Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS). The NAS calculated the fiscal impact of impacts  —   taxes paid minus costs, Camarota wrote.  Camarota offers the following conclusions from his study: The report of fiscal costs of immigrant border crossers is based on "net present value" (NPV). This process has a net effect of reducing the size of the net drain on economic resources based on their education level. "Rhe actual net lifetime fiscal cost of illegal   given their education levels, is possibly $140, 000 to $150, 000 each in their lifetimes if the NPV concept is not used," Camarota stated.
