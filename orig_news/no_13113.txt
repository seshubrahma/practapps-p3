Ben Howe, a leader of the dwindling   #NeverTrump group of moderate bloggers, pundits, and political consultants on the right, mocked the defenseless woman in San Jose whom protesters pelted with bottles, eggs, and food on Thursday night. [And all she did was try to make America great again.  https:  .   —   Ben Howe (@BenHowe) June 3, 2016,   Howe, who is a RedState contributing editor, has been leading the growingly embarrassing   #NeverTrump movement of moderate "movement conservative" political consultants, pundits, and bloggers upset over Trump’s victory in the Republican primary. When he received backlash over his mocking of the woman covered in egg yolks thanks to   protesters, he aimed to draw a moral equivalence between a woman being pelted with bottles and eggs and a reporter who had her arm grabbed while chasing a presidential candidate.

Only if it’s real. https:  .   —   Ben Howe (@BenHowe) June 3, 2016, Now Howe is trying to paint himself as the victim by retweeting all the mean things people on the internet said to him.
