(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Mourners lined the streets and police cars filled church parking lots as funerals were held for some of the five Dallas officers killed by a sniper last week. President Obama gathered law enforcement officials, civil rights activists and political figures at the White House and spoke about building trust between law enforcement and communities of color. Our latest poll shows that almost 70 percent of Americans say race relations are generally bad, an extraordinarily high level of racial discontent. _____ 2. Hillary Clinton portrayed Donald Trump as an existential threat to American democracy in a speech in Illinois, and mocked him for egotism and ignorance. She also addressed police violence and attacks on the police, invoking Abraham Lincoln, who in the same spot in 1858 proclaimed that "a house divided against itself cannot stand. " With enough work for unity, she said, "We, in fact, will be indivisible  —   with liberty and justice for all. " _____ 3. Mr. Trump, who is in the final stages of choosing a running mate, met with several candidates in Indiana, after his plane broke down. He also called for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to resign from the Supreme Court. "Her mind is shot," he tweeted after she publicly disparaged him twice. Separately, our political reporter interviewed dozens of people, including Trump supporters, white nationalists and scholars of race, to understand how Mr. Trump fosters a sense of white identity. "Everyone’s sticking together in their groups," explained a Long Island housewife, "so white people have to, too. " _____ 4. "We face a time of great national change," Britain’s new prime minister, Theresa May, said. It was an understatement, given the country’s internal ruptures and profound uncertainty over the vote to leave the European Union. She appointed Boris Johnson, the provocative former London mayor and Brexit leader, as foreign secretary, naming his predecessor, Philip Hammond, as chancellor of the Exchequer. _____ 5. Ringling Bros. bowing to   concerns, is debuting its new   circus in Los Angeles. Its   show, "Out of This World," offers some old standbys, like aerialists, a lion tamer and acrobats on horseback, but adds an ice floor, an elaborate narrative and a smartphone app. There are still plenty of animals: tigers, dogs, pigs and even a kangaroo. _____ 6. Police officers flooded a gritty patch of Brooklyn, N. Y. a day after 33 people suffered what appeared to be overdoses of synthetic marijuana known as   or Spice. "It’s like a scene out of a zombie movie, a horrible scene," said a man who saw three people collapse. Mayor Bill de Blasio said any stores found selling the drug would be shut down, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo compared its prevalence to the crack epidemic. _____ 7. The renowned portraitist Chuck Close, 76, has radically upended his style and his life, leaving his wife and worrying his children. In one of our   stories today, a man who has known the artist for years grapples with the metamorphosis. "He was producing startling new work that I wanted to understand," the author writes, "but it seemed to emerge from a spirit of liberation that left a path of devastation behind. " _____ 8. The U. N. Security Council met to decide whether to send more troops to South Sudan, where a devastating civil war has entered its third year. The U. N. peacekeepers have struggled with the mandate to protect civilians, coming under harsh criticism for failing to prevent an ethnic massacre at this U. N. camp in  . _____ 9. The Federal Election Commission fined three nonprofit groups for activities in 2010, when they were linked to the political network overseen by the wealthy, conservative Koch brothers. The groups agreed to pay more than $200, 000 in fines, but did not concede that accepting guidance from a Koch consultant had led to violations of federal rules. _____ 10. Finally, Boston is a city lacking tall major landmarks. No Statue of Liberty, no Space Needle. So this Citgo sign is, for many Bostonians, their icon. Now that the building on which it sits is being sold, a preservation group is trying to have it designated as a landmark, arguing that it is "a wonderful piece of American Pop Art from the 1960s.
