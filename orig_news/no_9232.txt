Thursday on MSNBC’s "Hardball," Bradley Whitford, an actor on the early 2000s political television show "The West Wing," said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was a "rodeo clown" with an "utter lack of shame" and "moral bankruptcy. "  Whitford said, "Well, I got to say, I always used to joke that the fakest thing aside from my teeth about ‘The West Wing" was we had rational Republicans. One of the things that really upsets me in an election is not a personality contest. It is an opportunity for us to have an important discussion about how to face these tremendously urgent issues, and this rodeo clown has sucked all the oxygen out of the room and I think it’s not good for us. " He added, "Well listen, he is fantastic television in the same way watching a car wreck is fascinating television. He’s hypnotic because of his utter lack of shame and his moral bankruptcy. It’s a hypnotic thing to watch. I just want to say I’ve been listening to your show on the way over and here we are talking about a candidate who is fat shaming people, a candidate who mocks people with disabilities. If I got a call from my son’s school and heard that he was mocking someone’s disabilities, that he was making fun of   girls, fat shaming girls, I would disown him. And yet at a time when we should be discussing, and I really want kids to understand how important this election is, five Supreme Court justices. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
