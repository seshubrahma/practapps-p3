Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos will attend a summit organised by Donald Trump with other leading technology entrepreneurs, according to reports. [The summit, which will reportedly take place at Trump Tower, will also include attendees such Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and a range of other industry leaders.  During the presidential campaign, Bezos was an aggressive critic of Donald Trump, with his newspaper The Washington Post even hiring up to 20 journalists with the objective of digging into every part of Donald Trump’s life. In response to Bezos’s tactics, Trump banned The Washington Post‘s supporters from his campaign events and accused Bezos of buying the newspaper solely to avoid paying taxes. Trump has also criticised Apple for not producing their products in America and also called for a boycott of the company following their refusal to unlock the phone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook. The vast majority of prominent technology executives, such as Facebook   Dustin Moskovitz, Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, actively endorsed Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Since Trump’s election, leading technology companies have also written an open letter to Trump encouraging him to allow high levels of immigration, as well as courting his support on a series of policies such as privacy law, data security, and net neutrality.
