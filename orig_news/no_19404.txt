’   Working class people from the Rust Belt played a large part   in getting Donald Trump elected earlier this   week.  ’ "   Trump’s  as jobs moved overseas.   The Brexit campaign had similar success on the areas of Britain   that hadn’t shared in the prosperity of the UK capital,   London.  " "   This chart from $150 billion Bridgewater Associates, the world’s   biggest hedge fund, shows just how hard people across the US and   Europe have been hit by globalization, and the loss of jobs to   other countries and to technology.  " ’  ’ ’   The graph is based on data from MIT economist David Autor   and shows how much   jobs, which generally   require some education after high school like community college   classes, have declined in the past 26 years. And it really   explains an awful lot. ’ ’   "What this election highlighted more than anything is that there   are lot of people in this country who, regardless of their   political leanings, are hurting," Jeffrey Solomon, CEO of Cowen   and Company, said in a note.
