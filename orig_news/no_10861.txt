HBO’s "Real Time" host Bill Maher argued, "the idea that when Syrian refugees come to European countries, or to America, that they are going to completely fit in, is a fantasy" and "This is the one issue the Democrats are going to lose the election on" on Friday.  Maher said that "insisting that people around the world who are not like us, are going to be like us" is a mistake in thinking, one that "we saw this, just recently, in Cologne, Germany. When all the Syrian refugees were going to Europe, I wasn’t for it, and I think a lot of people are coming around to that position. " He added, "if people don’t know what happened, on New Year’s Eve, in Cologne, Germany and a number of other cities in Europe, some of these refugees, some of these Muslim men, and of course, we’re talking about men who come from very misogynistic cultures. Their cultures are not like ours. " And "I don’t understand why liberals don’t stand up for the liberal values. " Maher later stated that while he feels compassion for the refugees, "a great many Muslims around the world are for Sharia Law. You know what is in Sharia Law, cutting off the hands off for thievery, putting women to death for adultery, killing people for leaving the religion, women are not equal citizens. These are not criminal activities in the Muslim society, these are activities, okay? So, the idea that when Syrian refugees come to European countries, or to America, that they are going to completely fit in, is a fantasy. " Maher then stated that while Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s ban on Muslims is "wrong. " "This is the one issue the Democrats are going to lose the election on. Because they have to choose between demagogue Donald Trump, and Hillary and Obama who won’t even say Islamic terrorism. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
