Trey Gowdy ( ) said that could lead Congress to subpoena her.  Gowdy said, "There are other ways to invite people other than via a letter. There are things called subpoenas. You shouldn’t have to use it with a former national security adviser, but if you do, you do. "Referencing Rice’s role in the unmasking of  Trump transition officials he said Rice is "a very important witness. " He added, "Members of Congress don’t pick the witnesses. Lawyers don’t pick witnesses. The facts pick the witnesses. And whether Ambassador Rice likes it or not, she’s a really important fact witness. " (  WFB) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
