In an effort to combat "fake news," Google has launched a new feature on their search engine titled "Fact Check" which adds a label to certain links indicating whether they have been confirmed by partisan   Snopes and Politifact. [Mashable reports that this new   feature was already implemented in some countries in October of 2016 but will now be rolled out globally in multiple languages. Now when you search for a news item, you should see results with a tag that states which claim is being   which organization did the   and a summary of the story’s credibility with a "true" or "false" rating.

"My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders," she said at the time. Snopes   David Emery let his obvious partisanship be known in December of 2016 when he asked if there were "any   Trump supporters" and tweeted, "Incredibly, some people actually think they have to put words in Trump’s mouth to make him look bad. " Google and Facebook have now appointed these organizations to act as the arbiters of truth in the digital age with little oversight from any governing body whatsoever.
