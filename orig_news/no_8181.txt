The   extremists at Salon are worried about Donald Trump. Unlike pretty much every other Republican ever created, the Late Night crowd can’t lay a glove on The Donald. Moreover, Trump is unafraid to enter that realm because he knows he can beat them at their own game. The   cabal that makes up our Comedian Class have finally bumped into a Republican they cannot damage.

" This should have allowed Colbert  —   one of the nation’s finest political satirists and the sharpest interviewer on late night  —   to skewer Trump hard. He set the bit up looking like he’d get the best of Trump, with an orange Trump wig on his bat phone. But Trump’s call  —   despite drawing some boos from the crowd  —   ended up making Trump look, if not good at least, far from foolish. Or rather, foolish in the usual way. Somehow, Trump has found a way to inoculate himself from criticism. Read the full piece here.
