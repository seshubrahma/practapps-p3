’  ’ ’   WASHINGTON (AP)  —   President Donald Trump is imposing a lifetime   ban on administration officials lobbying for foreign governments,   and a   ban for other lobbying. ’ ’   Trump used his executive authority Saturday to put in place the   bans  —   fulfilling part of his campaign pledge to "drain the   swamp" in Washington. ’ "   Trump has said that those who want to work for him should focus   on the job they’ll be doing for the American people, and not on   future income earned by peddling their influence after serving in   government. " "   Administration officials describe the bans as historic in scope.   But it’s not immediately clear how they’d be enforced. " ’   Trump also took a separate action to restructure the National   Security Council ask military advisers to prepare a plan to   defeat the Islamic State group. ’
