[The New York Republican told the crowd that spending time with veterans has been the "greatest honor of this campaign. "  "Our veterans are the bravest and the finest people on earth," Trump said, as he pledged to work with the VFW if elected president. "Our most basic commitment to provide health and medical care [to veterans] has been violated completely. " "The other candidate in this race, crooked Hillary Clinton, [  …    ] has a much different view," Trump jabbed.
