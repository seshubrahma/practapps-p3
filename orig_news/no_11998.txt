Monday on MSNBC, NBC’s "Meet the Press" moderator Chuck Todd explained that despite the notion that supporters of Republican presidential   Donald Trump won’t show up to the ballot box in the same way they are responding in the polls.  According to Todd, the Republican Party has to play nice with Trump supporters because without them, they can’t win a general election. "Republicans don’t win general elections without Donald Trump’s voters," Todd said on MSNBC. "OK, these folks have been frequent general election voters. They haven’t been frequent not primary voters, right. This is what there’s been a question  —   we used to call them Reagan Democrats. There’s been different names given over the years  —   certainly working class. Whatever you want to classify them today, it’s the same chunk of voters who have not been involved in primary politics in the past. And that’s why there has been skepticism with traditional Republicans, ‘Well, maybe they won’t come to the polls.’ But you can’t alienate them. You alienate them and they stay home then Republicans won’t win general elections. Reince Priebus is being the correct party leader here. You don’t want to trash Trump supporters.
