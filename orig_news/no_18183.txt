’  ’ ’   Conservative firebrand Tomi Lahren filed a lawsuit against Glenn   Beck and TheBlaze on Friday, alleging she was wrongfully   terminated for recently expressing a   opinion. ’ ’   The news she was fired, which TheBlaze disputed, was  by the Dallas Morning News. ’ ’   During a March 17 appearance on "The View," Lahren said she could   not "sit here and be a hypocrite and say I’m for limited   government but I think the government should decide what women do   with their bodies. " ’ ’   The comment ignited controversy, with   activists in   conservative media outraged Lahren had suggested they were   hypocrites. ’ ’   As a result of the comment,  said, Lahren was contacted by   TheBlaze’’s human resources director a few days later and   suspended indefinitely "all because of her   opinions   expressed on The View." ’ ’’ ’   Several days after being suspended, Lahren was reached again by   human resources and told her "services were no longer needed" and   that her employment was terminated, the lawsuit said.   Nevertheless, the company continued to pay her, the lawsuit said,   with hopes it "could find an exit strategy to sanitize" its   "unlawful conduct." ’ ’   "Plaintiff’s unilateral suspension and termination by [TheBlaze]   underscores the point that Beck and [TheBlaze] have a     litmus test, which cannot be reconciled with   the Employment Contract that specifically authorizes Plaintiff to   express her own views without the threat of retaliation," the   lawsuit said. ’ ’   Lahren said in the lawsuit that TheBlaze added "insult to injury"   by placing yellow caution tape over her office and terminating   her email account. She also said in the lawsuit that TheBlaze had   blocked access to her Facebook page and contended it was not the   company’’s "intellectual property." ’ ’   Lahren, whose footprint on the internet has grown immensely with   President Donald Trump’’s rise to power, also jabbed Beck’’s public   stature, claiming TheBlaze’’s actions were motivated by "specific   intent to inflate" his profile "from what has become a mediocre   following." Beck alienated many of his supporters during the 2016   presidential election by taking a strong   stance. ’ ’   The lawsuit concluded by asking for a temporary restraining   order. It also asked the court to enter a permanent   injunctive relief order to prevent the destruction of   evidence, and for Beck and TheBlaze to cover her legal fees "as   well as other relief" that "she may show herself justly   entitled." ’ "   In a statement provided to Business Insider, TheBlaze disputed   Lahren’s claim she was fired. " ’   "It is puzzling that an employee who remains under contract (and   is still being paid) has sued us for being fired, especially when   we continue to comply fully with the terms of our agreement with   her," the company said. ’ ’   Beck declined to comment.  ’ ’ This story has been updated with comment from TheBlaze. ’ ’ Disclosure: The author of this story previously was employed   at TheBlaze. ’ ’Conservative firebrand Tomi Lahren filed a. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
