On this weekend’s broadcast of "Fox News Sunday," Vice   Mike Pence said he was not offended by the cast of the Broadway musical "Hamilton," which addressed him after the performance he attended.  Pence said, "Well, first off, my daughter and I and her cousins really enjoyed the show. "Hamilton" is just an incredible production, incredibly talented people. It was a real joy to be there. You know, when we arrived, we heard a few boos, we heard some cheers. I nudged my kids and reminded them that’s what freedom sounds like. But at the end, you know, I did hear what was said from the stage, and I can tell you I wasn’t offended by what was said. I’ll leave to others whether that was the appropriate venue to say it. I do want to say that the basic element, the center of that message is one that I want to address, that is, I know this is a very disappointing time for people that did not see their candidate win in that national election. " "I know this is a very anxious time for some people," he added. "I just want to reassure people that what   Donald Trump said on election night, he absolutely meant from the bottom of his heart. He is preparing to be the president of all of the people of the United Satates of America, and to watch him bringing together people of diverse views, bringing together people that differed with him strongly, seeing him talk to leaders around the world, I just want to reassure every American that in the days ahead, I’m very confident that they’re going to see   Donald Trump be a president for all of the people, and we embrace that principle and we’re going to work hard to make that principle every day that we serve.
