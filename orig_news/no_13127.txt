Actor Alec Baldwin’s parody of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is a hit with viewers, but his younger brother Stephen Baldwin doesn’t find it all that amusing. ["Well, he’s got the voice down. I think it’s getting a little too nasty right now. I don’t want to be   here, but I don’t think it’s very funny," Stephen Baldwin told CBS News this week after the final presidential debate in Las Vegas.  The actor, who endorsed Trump’s candidacy in July, said there’s nothing comical about the issues facing the country. "I don’t think there’s anything funny about this election," Baldwin said. "I think it’s very serious, very important. We have never had this much stagnation in our economy as God only knows how long, I don’t know the numbers. "There’s just no fooling around anymore," he added. Alec Baldwin debuted his Trump spoof during the premiere of Saturday Night Live’s 42nd season on October 2.  The episode was a ratings success but the Republican nominee was not impressed, calling the SNL episode a "hit job. " "Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me," he tweeted. "Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!" Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016,  "Young people, millennials, undecided voters, everybody’s got 20 days now to really do their homework and decide who they think is going to lead this country in the direction it needs to be [and] back on its feet economically," Stephen Baldwin said Wednesday.
