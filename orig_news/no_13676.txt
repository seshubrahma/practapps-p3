Sunday on Fox News Channel’s "MediaBuzz," while discussing the fake news controversy, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said of the New York Times, "I think if you look back through their coverage of the Trump campaign and the Clinton campaign  —   to use your language and not mine  —  they had a fair amount of conspiratorial BS. "  He continued, "Things that they would cover that just weren’t true. The best example was the woman who repudiated the entire article and said that they took what was a totally positive   —  ’He was a nice man I enjoyed the date.’ —  and they turned it into Trump hitting on me, acting inappropriately. And she’s the one who held the press conference and said this is crazy. But I’ll give you a a much deeper more serious example. Their coverage of Fidel Castro was totally fake. Their coverage of Stalin in the ’30s was totally fake. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
