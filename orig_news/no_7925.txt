" "It’s beautiful, it’s hopefully going to be a good game," he said. "But really it’s just something I wanted to see. It’s the Armed Forces, the way I look at it. And I love and respect the Armed Forces. I mean, I think we’re going to have a good time. " The   in his younger days, attended New York Military Academy, somewhere he learned about the sacrifice those in uniform make for the country. "I learned that I respected [military discipline]," Trump said of his time at New York Military Academy. "And I learned that I respected people in the military and I always have, at least since I’ve been there. We had military people there we had drill sergeants and colonels and we actually had a general. I always respected those people and I learned that at a young age. They’re terrific. " Urban, whose work in Pennsylvania for Trump after joining his campaign when former Sen. Rick Santorum dropped out in the early parts of the primary proved crucial in not just the primaries but also the general election, told Breitbart News that the images of Trump interacting with the Army cadets and Navy midshipmen were iconic and reminded him of when President Ronald Reagan rallied the military when he was  . "You saw a    who when he entered the stadium took the time to shake the hands of the cadets and midshipmen who were waiting to meet him and looked each one of them in their eyes and said ‘thank you’ to them," Urban, the man responsible for delivering Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes to Trump in the general election, said in a phone interview. "Serving, he understands it on a personal level and has a great personal affection for all of those who served in harm’s way and are willing to serve in harm’s way and make the ultimate sacrifice.   Trump understands that the young men who suited up and played yesterday’s game, upon graduation are going to put themselves in harm’s way to keep our nation safe.

"So it has a great following and for him to be there to be with the teams and the fans and all the other people watching was a real expression I think of his grasp of the role of   . " Nicholson added that the military community is thrilled to have Trump on board as the next leader of America’s armed forces. "He got a rousing welcome there from the military, and the people who go to a game like that are themselves very   and attached to the military in different ways," Nicholson said. "They were most enthusiastic about his presence there throughout the chain of command from the cadets all the way through to the Chief of Staff of the Army who spent most of the first half with us in the box. " Braithewaite, the retired Navy Rear Admiral who’s also helping with the Trump transition team, told Breitbart News he’s heard from many servicemen and women over the past few weeks and they’re ecstatic Trump is becoming President. "There is a groundswell of just improved morale across all of the Armed Services and it’s just amazing to see," Braithewaite told Breitbart News. "I haven’t seen this in my   years of Naval service. You just get the sense of born again patriotism. Yesterday, Mr. Trump was so   by the military that it really does signal a new beginning for our military forces and for our country. I think it’s a reclamation of our patriotism and a belief in the foundation of our country —  duty, honor, country. "   Braithwaite, who joined the Naval Academy back toward the end of former President Jimmy Carter’s administration, compared the energy for Trump in the Armed Forces community to that which Ronald Reagan saw as he was about to take office. "I joined the Navy at the end of the Carter administration and the transformation when President Reagan came in was just unbelievable," Braithwaite said. "It was palpable. You could feel it, and it was overnight. I’ll tell you, I feel the same way now, that this has been probably the first time in the last 20 some years when we felt this kind of support from the    and I think that was really kind of evident yesterday at the game. I think that people saw for the first time the kind of    that   Trump will be and it’s, again, a kind of rebirth of patriotism across our country. " Braithewaite believes that the troops see in Trump someone who believes in them. "I think he believes in them," he said. "As part of the transformation team, I am hearing constantly from them that for the first time in a long time they feel like there’s an emphasis on their service. Our military people are out there sacrificing each and every day personally and professionally. They feel this is a new dawn if you will in getting the kind of support from a    that will really help them in being the preeminent military service in the world and reclaiming the stature of America. It’s pretty amazing, I will tell you, and it’s a phenomenal opportunity to see the military recognized for what they’re preparing to do —  what they’re preparing to sacrifice —  on behalf of all of us to guarantee our freedom. That’s huge. " Swann, the former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver who went on to serve as former President George W. Bush’s chair of the President’s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition, told Breitbart News that Trump’s appearance at the   game was huge for the cadets and midshipmen and all those serving the country right now. "I think it was very important to all of the branches of the service and especially to the cadets and midshipmen and young people serving in the military that can see a demonstration of support from the incoming president," Swann said in a phone interview. "I think there was genuine excitement for   Trump being there, and I think throughout his campaign he has always supported the military and leading with the strength of the military. I don’t think the   is ever going to allow his military to go without. Back when it comes to being supportive of the best equipment and the best training and thoughtfulness about how they’re deployed and how they’re used. But as you know, most people and most leadership throughout the military, while they serve, there’s no political opinion —  they serve the    and he’s going to be the next   . " Swann’s son, who plays for Army, helped the team win its first game in the iconic annual rivalry in 15 years. "That’s right —  and a great moment for the Superintendent and the head coach, they’ve been behind for a number of years and for all of these varsity players to get a gold star for the win over Navy on their letterman’s jacket, that’s huge," Swann said when asked about how it felt for Army to win. Looking forward, each of these guys and more that Breitbart News spoke with believes that it’s morning in America again and Trump represents a fresh new style of leadership in the United States. When asked to compare his history as a winner with Trump’s theme of winning, Swann noted that despite the intense   rivalry over the years, at the end of the day these guys are all on the same side against America’s enemies on the world stage. "I don’t think the   has ever shied away from the fact that he’s coming out on top, being the winner," Swann said. "He’s based most of his personal career, and everything else he’s done, on being a winner. When look at a rivalry team like Army and Navy, it’s very competitive. It’s a big rivalry game. It’s about winning. But when you look at the Army and Navy, you want them both to win because eventually and essentially they are on the same team.

"I think it was a real morale boost for the military, which they need these days, and it was a sign they’re going to have a real friend and supporter and morale encourager in this new    they’re going to have in a few weeks," Nicholson said. Braithewaite sees a bright future ahead. "As an American, as a military member, as a veteran, the future is really bright for our country and for those of who don the uniform for our country," Braithewaite said.
