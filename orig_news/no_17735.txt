Syrians have been banned   indefinitely, and   from six     countries  —   Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen  —   have   been barred entry for at least the next three months. ’ ’’ "   Critics of Trump’s refugee ban say it is discriminatory and   violates the Constitution’s religious freedom guarantees.
