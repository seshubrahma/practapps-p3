Amidst the media hubbub around Donald Trump’s new accusers, Hillary Clinton campaigned this week with a man who has faced several accusations of sexual assault  —   not former President Bill Clinton, but former Vice President Al Gore. [Clinton appeared with Gore in Miami on Tuesday, focusing her remarks on climate change. Notably, neither mentioned the accusations against Trump, which Clinton and her surrogates have mentioned at nearly every other opportunity in the past several days.  They likely avoided the topic for a very good reason: Al Gore has been accused of worse, and has even faced police investigation for sexual assault, though (he has never been charged). As the Business Insider reported in 2010: Former Vice President Al Gore has been hit by new allegations of sexual assault. This time, it’s two more massage therapists bringing the charges. The former VP is already in hot water, fighting abuse claims in Portland, where another masseuse said Gore groped her in ’06 and asked her to perform a "chakra release" (  for "hand job".) He denies everything. The new allegations are said to have taken place at two hotels  —   one in Beverly Hills in 2007, when Gore was in Hollywood for the Oscars, the other in Tokyo in 2008. A source from the luxury hotel in Beverly Hills told The Enquirer: "The therapist claimed that when they were alone, Gore shrugged off a towel and stood naked in front of her. " He then propositioned her for a sexual act, according to The Enquirer. One accuser called Gore a "crazed sex poodle. " In their reporting on the joint   appearance, the media ignored the allegations against Gore, even as he shared the stage with Hillary Clinton. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
