"Ian Bremmer, geopolitical analyst and president of the Eurasia Group, shares his opinions on President Trump’s foreign trip. Following is a transcript of the video." "I think that this trip was quite well planned by the Trump Administration. You know that presidents usually go to Canada or Mexico first. It’s not a long trip, they’re the most aligned and closest allies, there’s nowhere else they can go for help particularly, right? Trump didn’t do that. And that was right because the Canadians and the Mexicans have serious problems with Trump on immigration, on climate change, on trade, you name it. And furthermore, there would have been big demonstrations against Trump if he had done either of those trips as president. Where, he went to Saudi Arabia first. The Saudis really disliked Obama, they were delighted that Trump came in on his Iran views, on his human rights lack abuse, on his focus on security. Then, he goes to Israel, he feels very comfortable with Netanyahu personally, the family gets along with them, he’s treated quite well, goes to the Vatican after that, doesn’t have a good relationship with the people but the pope is not going to embarrass him."
