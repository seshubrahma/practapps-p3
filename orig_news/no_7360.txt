Retired Gen. David Petraeus said early Sunday that he did not cast a vote for or against   Donald Trump because he does not vote, the Hill reports. Trump is considering the former CIA director for secretary of state. ["I don’t vote, so that’s an easy answer," Petraeus told ABC’s This Week. "And I also did not support him nor did I oppose him. Nor did I support or oppose any other candidate. I’ve truly tried to be apolitical, nonpolitical," he said Sunday.  He also said on the program that the   was "quite pragmatic," commenting on his meeting in New York City last week with Trump for a potential cabinet position. Trump is considering several other people for the State Department, including former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and Sen. Bob Corker ( . ).
