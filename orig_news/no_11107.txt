Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for Hillary Clinton in Warren, Ohio today, but he admitted that some of the middle class workers present were "mad" at the former First Lady. ["By the way, you know, I know some of you are mad at Hillary. I know some of you look at her and say  …    " Biden began as he trailed off.  He emphasized that Clinton would stand for the American worker and for labor unions. "Let me tell you something, man, she gets it and she never yields, she does not break," he said.  But even Biden admitted that the Democrats in power hadn’t fully fulfilled their promises to working Americans. "It is still a struggle," he said. "The thing that I criticize in my party [for] if anything, while we’re worrying about getting everybody off their knees, couples making $70, 000, $80, 000, $90, 000 a year with two kids are still struggling, man. It’s hard. It’s really hard. " Biden tried to emphasize to the workers present that Republicans would never help the middle class, because they opposed the auto bailout. "You’re making the best damn cars in the world again," he bragged. He also argued that the auto unions helped save the auto industry rather than destroy it. "The UAW  —   You all contributed the most," he said. "You gave the most at the office, as they say, to resurrect this industry. " He also tried to mock Donald Trump by trying to cram two separate images into the same sentence. "This is a guy born with a silver spoon in his mouth that he is choking on because now his foot is in his mouth along with the spoon," he said, staring at the teleprompter. Maybe Biden should avoid    jokes  …     pic. twitter.   —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) September 1, 2016,  The joke drew some snickering on Twitter as even a former Obama speech writer criticized the writing. "I feel like we can workshop this and then we’ll really have something," Jon Lovett wrote, highlighting Biden’s remark on Twitter.
