WASHINGTON  —   Just moments after the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was declared dead, President Trump sought to paint the defeat of his first legislative effort as an   blip. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, was preparing to tell the public that the health care bill was being withdrawn  —   a byproduct, Mr. Trump said, of Democratic partisanship. The president predicted that Democrats would return to him to make a deal in roughly a year. "Look, we got no Democratic votes. We got none, zero," Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview he initiated with The New York Times. "The good news is they now own health care. They now own Obamacare. " Mr. Trump insisted that the Affordable Care Act would collapse in the next year, which would then force Democrats to come to the bargaining table for a new bill. "The best thing that can happen is that we let the Democrats, that we let Obamacare continue, they’ll have increases from 50 to 100 percent," he said. "And when it explodes, they’ll come to me to make a deal. And I’m open to that. " Although enrollment in the Affordable Care Act declined slightly in the past year, there is no sign that it is collapsing. Its expansion of Medicaid continues to grow. In a later phone interview with The Times, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, ridiculed Mr. Trump’s remarks about Democrats being at fault. "Whenever the president gets in trouble, he points fingers of blame," Mr. Schumer said. "It’s about time he stopped doing that and started to lead. The Republicans were totally committed to repeal from the   never talked to us once. But now that they realize that repeal can’t work, if they back off repeal, of course we’ll work with them to make it even better. " Mr. Trump said that "when they come to make a deal," he would be open and receptive. He singled out the Tuesday Group moderates for praise, calling them "terrific," an implicit jab at the House Freedom Caucus, which his aides had expressed frustration with during negotiations. Even so, he tried to minimize the deep divisions within his own party that prevented Mr. Ryan from securing passage of the bill, and maintained that they were six to 12 votes away from getting it across the finish line. As Mr. Trump spoke, his voice was flatly calm and slightly hoarse, his manner subdued. He talked on a speaker phone from his desk in the Oval Office, with a coterie of aides drifting by. At one point, he welcomed his daughter Ivanka back from a ski trip. Mr. Trump said that in states he had visited in the last two weeks, Tennessee and Kentucky, the problems with President Barack Obama’s signature legislation were evident. The president said he was now moving on to taxes and trade as priorities. Mr. Trump described his first major legislative experience as not terribly different than what his previous negotiations as a   developer had been like. He emphatically did not fault Mr. Ryan. "I don’t blame him for a thing, I really don’t," Mr. Trump said. He added: "Even during the midst of negotiations I said the best thing that could happen was just to back off. I said, I’ll do it now because I’m a team player. " He said that Mr. Ryan did not apologize to him, adding: "Look, he tried. He tried very hard. " "I’m not disappointed," he insisted. "If I were, I wouldn’t be calling you. "
