From the Wall Street Journal:[Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is bringing two new managers to the top of his campaign in a bid to recover ground he has lost in recent weeks. Stephen Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News LLC, an outspoken Trump supporter and a former Goldman Sachs banker, will assume the new position of campaign chief executive. At the same time, Mr. Trump also is promoting Kellyanne Conway, a veteran GOP pollster and strategist, to become campaign manager. Ms. Conway has been a campaign adviser for several weeks. Longtime Republican operative Paul Manafort, who joined the campaign late in the primary season, remains campaign chairman. But the reset is designed to bulk up a structure that many Republicans have complained wasn’t adequate for the rigors of the   campaign. [  …    ] Mr. Trump initially held to his unorthodox style and structure, arguing that they succeeded in winning the nomination. In recent days, however, Mr. Trump has been working behind the scenes to get more of what he called "firepower" atop his thinly staffed campaign organization, advisers said. On Sunday at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N. J. Mr. Trump, who sought out Mr. Bannon, met with him and Mr. Manafort to lay out his new thinking for the campaign team. [  …    ] In addition, the new team is likely to beef up campaign work in polling and analytics, areas of strength for Mr. Bannon and Ms. Conway, advisers said. The appointment of Mr. Bannon is likely to stir its own controversy. Breitbart News, which he runs, is a freewheeling populist news site that has served as a kind of platform for Trump supporters. He has, among other things, helped produce a movie about the personal wealth of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump has known Mr. Bannon, a former Naval officer, for years. Mr. Bannon will take a leave of absence from Breitbart. Read the rest here.
