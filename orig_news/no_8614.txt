  Donald Trump is planning a victory tour to states that voted for him, including swing states that supported a Republican for president for the first time in decades. ["We’re working on a victory tour now. It will happen in the next couple of weeks," Trump’a advance team director, George Gigicos, confirmed to reporters at Trump Tower on Friday.  The tour will take place after Thanksgiving, according to Gigicos, but it remains unclear exactly what Trump has planned. Trump’s political presidential rallies defined his campaign, drawing tens of thousands of supporters across the country. They have also been a focal point for violence and protests from leftists opposing his campaign, who will undoubtedly try to disrupt his attempt to rally the country. Trump has remained largely silent since making brief remarks to the media during his visit with President Obama at the White House shortly after winning the election. He remains at Trump Tower planning his administration and focusing on his transition into power.
