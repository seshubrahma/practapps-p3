Sunday on NBC’s "Meet the Press," when asked if he should get out of the presidential race because he is dividing the   vote with Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) Republican presidential candidate Gov. John Kasich ( ) said no and added he should be thanked for beating Donald Trump in Ohio.  Kasich said, "Maybe Ted ought to get out, because he can’t win in the fall. Maybe these people that are hot on that ought to tell him to do it. They try to tell me to get out of the race how many times, and now they should be thanking me for staying in, because if Trump had won Ohio, it would be over. I have a record of accomplishment, a record of bringing people together, a vision for the future of this country. And guess what? in the grassroots, people are getting it. "
