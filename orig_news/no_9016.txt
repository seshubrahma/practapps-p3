On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd stated that Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has "a darker place that she makes decisions from a place of fear and insecurity," while GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is the "ultimate huckster who is selling in the moment. "  Dowd said of Clinton, "It’s like she is a wonderful public servant who wants to save the world. She’s always had that part of her and still does, but then there’s a darker place that she makes decisions from a place of fear and insecurity, and that kind of trips up the public servant side. So, you always have the good side and then she gets  —   you know, I was thinking, it’s like Donald Trump has his wall, but she has her wall. You know, that  —   and you saw it with the health thing, the defensiveness, the secretiveness. That is so   to her. " She stated that while she liked some things about Trump in the beginning, "[H]e was kind of a truth teller in the beginning, until, it  —   you know, he turned into a not truth teller. " Dowd continued of Trump, "It’s more like wishful thinking. Like he wished he had been against Iraq from the beginning. But, I do have to give him credit. He turned against it.   …     He turned against it way before a lot of the New York cognizanti, so. " Dowd later added, "[O]nce little Muslim kids and Muslim women start getting attacked, it’s not funny. " She further stated Trump was the "ultimate huckster who is selling in the moment.
