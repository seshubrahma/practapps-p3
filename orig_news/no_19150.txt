"   Donald Trump’s  throughout Monday night’s debate set   social media ablaze as viewers wondered if it was a nervous tick,   allergies, or a cold. " ’   Former Vermont governor and 2004 presidential candidate Howard   Dean, however, had a different theory: ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tNotice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user? ’t’t’ "   Dean’s tweet quickly went viral, racking up more than 26, 000   retweets by Tuesday afternoon. " "   Trump told Fox on Tuesday morning that he wasn’t sniffling and   that he does not have a cold. Still, Dean defended his hypothesis   on MSNBC on Tuesday. " ’ ’ ’   "Well, you can’’t make a diagnosis over the television, but [the   sniffling] is a signature of people who use cocaine," Dean said.   "I’’m not suggesting that Trump does, but  —  " ’ ’   MSNBC reporter Kate Snow interjected, noting that Dean suggested   that in his tweet. ’ ’   "I’’m just suggesting that we think about it," Dean said. "He   sniffed during the presentation, which is something that   [cocaine] users do. He also has grandiosity, which is something   that accompanies that problem." ’ ’   Dean said that Trump has "delusions," such as his tendency to     on issues and think he won’’t "get caught." ’ ’   Dean continued: ’ ’   Snow said Dean’’s comments resembled the conspiracy theories   floated about Hillary Clinton’’s health by former New York City   Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has speculated about her condition and   encouraged people to "Google Hillary Clinton’’s illness." ’ ’   Dean said that Trump has not made his medical history public "in   any meaningful way." ’ ’   "Hillary Clinton has done that," he said. ’ ’   The former DNC chair added that he didn’’t find his cocaine theory   to be a "ridiculous idea." ’ ’   "Something funny was going on with Donald Trump last night," he   said. ’ ’   Dean said he would "absolutely" not apologize or delete the   tweet. He told Snow he stands by his charges and said Trump   needed to answer them. ’
