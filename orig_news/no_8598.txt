Comedian and prolific tweeter Patton Oswalt defended Hillary Clinton over concerns about her health on Sunday, calling it "badass" that the Democratic presidential candidate is campaigning "as hard as she is" after being diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. ["Wait, so Hillary has PNEUMONIA and she’s still campaigning as hard as she is? You realize how badass that is, right?" the    King of Queens star tweeted.

Clinton’s campaign issued a statement saying that the candidate had felt "overheated," before Clinton’s doctor, Dr. Lisa Bardack, said in a statement later Sunday that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. Earlier this month, FBI documents concerning the investigation into Clinton’s private email server released by the agency revealed that the former Secretary of State told investigators she could not recall every State Department briefing she received about handling sensitive material due to a concussion she had sustained in 2012. Clinton cancelled her scheduled trip to California this week, where she had been set to attend fundraisers in Los Angeles and San Francisco on Monday and Tuesday, including at the homes of Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane and billionaire businessman Barry Diller. Oswalt has frequently defended Clinton and attacked her rival, Republican Donald Trump, to his more than 2. 8 million followers on Twitter in recent months. Guys, let Trump’s campaign run with the #BasketOfDeplorables thing while they can. They’ve only got so much time before Trump’s next gaffe.  —   Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 11, 2016,  Trump’s turned everyone with an IQ over 100 into the crazy old man at the beginning FRIDAY THE 13th.

On Sunday, liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore urged Clinton to take a week to rest, calling the pneumonia diagnosis "serious. " Well, pneumonia. That’s serious. Campaign kept it hidden   .
