Wednesday on MSNBC’s "MTP Daily," while commenting on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s latest attacks on his opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s    accusations between   Clinton’s State Department and her family’s organization the Clinton Foundation, MSNBC anchor and NBC News chief Washington correspondent Andrea Mitchell said Trump’s campaign CEO Steve Bannon is "somebody who has traced the history and knows what buttons to push. "  Mitchell said, "I’ll tell you where this is really damaging. I got a call from a   very close, strong Clinton supporter in one of the states, an elected official. And out of the blue, this is someone who I talk to around primary days and such, saying, ‘Hey, what’s going on here? What about these 15, 000 emails? Is there going to be more stuff out here? What do we have to worry about?’ This is no longer a beltway problem. This is becoming part of the narrative. We’re seeing it in the polling where it’s following her around. She is actually fortunate that Donald Trump has so many other issues. But they should want to clean this up. " She continued, "Steve Bannon is no accident. This is the thing Breitbart was able to do. They are very effective. They know where —  when you start to hear Donald Trump this week saying not only that this is the Clinton Foundation and    but this is the kind of stuff they did in Arkansas, you know right away that’s Steve Bannon, that’s somebody who has traced the history and knows what buttons to push.
