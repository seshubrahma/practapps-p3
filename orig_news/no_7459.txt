The establishment media is insisting today that Donald Trump asked dictator Vladimir Putin’s Russian hackers to break into Americans’ computers. [But the plain text of Trump’s lengthy   press conference today shows him repeatedly saying that the hackers  —   likely Russians  —   should release the emails they have already hacked from Hillary Clinton’s email server at the Department of State.  Trump also suggested that the Russians have already hacked emails from Obama’s Democratic National Committee. When asked about the DNC emails, Trump repeatedly says Russia has likely already hacked emails from the DNC computers. According the transcript provided by The Washington Post, he said, When he was asked about Clinton’s missing 30, 000 or 33, 000 emails from her work at the Department of State, Trump repeatedly suggests that the Russians already hacked and stored the 30, 000   emails.  Also, Clinton says her lawyers deleted those many emails, which means they are now literally impossible to hack in the future.   So there’s no purpose or possibility of hacking already hacked (and deleted) emails.
