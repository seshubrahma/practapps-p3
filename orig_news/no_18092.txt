’  ’ ’   The AHCA is dead, long live the AHCA. ’ "   The healthcare bill’s swift death occured, in part, because House   Speaker Paul Ryan and the Trump administration are anxious to get   to some legislative policy where they can rack up a win  —     specifically, tax reform. " "   But it’s not going to be that easy, especially not without the   spending cuts the passage of the AHCA would’ve provided. " "   Republicans needed those cuts because they are trying to pass tax   reform through a mechanism called budget reconciliation. That   allows a measure to be passed by a simple majority  —   so no   Democracts can filibuster  —   as long as its revenue neutral   (doesn’t add to the deficit). " "   Now, without the AHCA cuts, it’s going to be harder to go with   the substantial tax cuts Trump and Ryan’s plan have proposed   without adding to the deficit, so that’s one hurdle. " ’’ ’   Another is in the details of Ryan’’s "Better Way" bill itself, and   they aren’’t small details. Ryan’’s plan fundamentally changes   America’’s tax system by significantly lowering the corporate tax   rate from 35% to 20% cutting out breaks for corporate America  —     like net interest deductions  —   and implementing a border   adjustment tax (BAT). ’ "   The border adjustment tax would be a huge change for us. Most   simply, it’s a tax on imported goods and a tax break for exported   goods. The way supporters of the measure reason it, the tax   domestic importers have to pay will be offset by a strengthening   dollar. Plus, it will go a long way in raising revenue to make   this tax bill passable through reconciliation, so fiscal hawks   (like the intractable Freedom Caucus) like it.
