Talk show host Chelsea Handler ripped Donald Trump in an interview at Variety‘s Entertainment and Tech Summit this week, calling the Republican presidential candidate a representation of "everything that’s wrong in the world. "[The star of Netflix’s Chelsea told Variety     Andrew Wallenstein that as far as selecting material for her weekly show, it doesn’t get better than the 2016 presidential race.  "What are we gonna do with Donald Trump when he’s gone?" Handler said. "I don’t know that I want him to go away. It’s great to have a person like that represent everything that’s wrong in the world. " "It’s always a good thing to be able to look at somebody and be like, ‘That’s the worst thing that could happen,’" she added. "And I think we should keep him in the spotlight. Not as president, obviously, but, you know, as The Apprentice or whatever that show is called. " The    comedian has been extremely critical of Trump this year. In April, Handler posted a   picture to her Instagram account in which she posed with the phrase "Donald Trump is a butt hole" scrawled across her back.  Sometimes we swim above water and sometimes we swim on the sea floor. I’ll meet you wherever you are.
