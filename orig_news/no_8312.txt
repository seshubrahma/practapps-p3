In their yearly   of what they deem "The Best and Worst Journalism of 2015," the venerable and widely respected Columbia Journalism Review lays bare the sort of bias the Republicans can expect in the 2016 election cycle, as they claim the media "coddled" Donald Trump. [That’s right. The Columbia Journalism Review claims that the media was too easy on Donald Trump.

The headline of the Huffington Post ran when Trump made his announcement: "Donald Trump Is Actually Running For President. God Help Us All. " The Columbia Journalism Review is the house organ of Columbia University’s prestigious graduate school of journalism and, as such, carries influence with journalists working in newsrooms across the nation.
