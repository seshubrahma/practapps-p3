Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 6 percentage points, according to a new USA   University poll.  Clinton’s 46% to 40% edge is a tighter margin than the poll has found in the past, suggesting that Trump is narrowing the advantage Clinton has had since the two became their parties’ presumptive nominees. Just two months ago, the same poll showed Clinton up 11 points.  The poll also found high interest in the election    though much of what Americans are expressing is concern.  It found 61% said they are alarmed by the 2016 presidential race, while 23% are excited    and just 9% are bored.  When Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein were factored in, Clinton’s lead was 39% to Trump’s 35% with 8% for Johnson and 3% for Stein.  Both Clinton and Trump have high negatives, with 53% of those polled saying they have an unfavorable view of Clinton and 60% saying they have an unfavorable view of Trump.  The poll of 1, 000 likely voters was conducted June   and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
