Sunday on ABC’s "This Week," Republican presidential   Donald Trump responded to an attack from his opponent Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) that questioned him as being a proponent of ObamaCare.  Trump dismissed that claim, but said he wanted some sort of health care for the poor. "That’s true," Trump said. "I want people taken care of. I have a heart. I want people taken care of. If people have no money, we have to help them. That doesn’t mean single payer. It means we have to help people. If somebody has no money and they’re lying in the middle of the street and dying. " "How do you do it?" Stephanopoulos asked. "We’ll work with the hospitals, doctors, we’ve got to do something," Trump replied. "You can’t have a small percentage of our economy have no protection so they end up dying from what you could have a simple procedure or a pill. You can’t do that. I’ll work something out. That doesn’t mean single payer. Maybe he’s got no heart. If I lose an election, that’s fine. Because frankly, we have to take care of the people in our country. We can’t let them die on the side walks of New York or Iowa or anywhere else. so  —   but that’s not single payer. As far as Obamacare is concerned. One of the staples of my speech, you can ask my supporters, it’s repeal and replace ObamaCare. The premiums are going up, 25 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent. It’s an outrage. It will probably fail on its own unless the Republicans renew it by ’17. A whole staple of my campaign is getting rid of ObamaCare and replacing it. " Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
