Monday on "The Howie Carr Show," Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said former president Bill Clinton should be asked how he was different from Bill Cosby, who was recently criminally charged for an alleged 2004 sexual assault.  Trump said, "Well, the Cosby thing is a weird deal and he’s got himself some big problems, and you almost have to ask Bill Clinton that question. It would be a very interesting question to someday ask him. Certainly he has a lot of strong charges against him and it’s pretty bad stuff. And it only got brought up because she said I have sexist tendencies. And I respect women so much and I’ll protect women and I’ll protect them and I’ll protect the whole country.
