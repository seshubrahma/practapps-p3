Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher speculated Sunday night that Donald Trumpâ€™s occasional sniffling during the second presidential debate stems from the fact that he is "absolutely" a cocaine user. [The    actress was tweeting along with the debate Sunday night when a fan asked her whether she thought the Republican candidate was a "coke head. "   "@carriefisher tell me something about that sniffle  â€¦    coke head or no?" the Twitter user wrote to the actress. "Iâ€™m an expert  ABSOLUTELY," Fisher replied. Fisher has been open about her own drug use during a period in the 1980s, including while she was working on set during the filming of the original Star Wars sequel. "We did cocaine on the set of [The] Empire [Strikes Back] in the ice planet," Fisher told the Guardian in a 2010 interview. "I didnâ€™t even like coke that much. It was just a case of getting on whatever train I needed to take to get high. " The actress ultimately gave up drugs when she had begun to realize she was "losing [her] choice in the matter. " "If Iâ€™d been addicted to booze Iâ€™d be dead now, because you just go out and get it," she told the paper. Fisher was one of many celebrities to weigh in during Sunday nightâ€™s contest between Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The actress repeatedly criticized Trump, at one point calling him a "classless thug.
