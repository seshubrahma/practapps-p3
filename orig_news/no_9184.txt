The Wall Street Journal’s Potomac Watch columnist Kimberley Strassel details the "devastating case against a Clinton presidency" that can be made by reviewing the WikiLeaks documents combined with what is already known in the public record. Strassel notes that although "the nation now has proof of pretty much everything [Hillary Clinton] has been accused of," the media "has almost uniformly ignored the flurry of bombshells, preferring to devote its front pages" to the story that Donald Trump "made lewd remarks a decade ago and now stands accused of groping women. "[ From Strassel in the Wall Street Journal:  The Obama administration —  the federal government, supported by tax dollars —  was working as an extension of the Clinton campaign. The State Department coordinated with her staff in responding to the email scandal, and the Justice Department kept her team informed about developments in the court case. Worse, Mrs. Clinton’s State Department, as documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show, took special care of donors to the Clinton Foundation. In a series of 2010 emails, a senior aide to Mrs. Clinton asked a foundation official to let her know which groups offering assistance with the Haitian earthquake relief were "FOB" (Friends of Bill) or "WJC VIPs" (William Jefferson Clinton VIPs). Those who made the cut appear to have been teed up for contracts. Those who weren’t? Routed to a standard government website. The leaks show that the foundation was indeed the nexus of influence and money. The head of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Ira Magaziner, suggested in a 2011 email that Bill Clinton call Sheikh Mohammed of Saudi Arabia to thank him for offering the use of a plane. In response, a top Clinton Foundation official wrote: "Unless Sheikh Mo has sent us a $6 million check, this sounds crazy to do. "   …     The leaks also show that the press is in Mrs. Clinton’s pocket. Donna Brazile, a former Clinton staffer and a TV pundit, sent the exact wording of a coming CNN town hall question to the campaign in advance of the event. Other media allowed the Clinton camp to veto which quotes they used from interviews, worked to maximize her press events and offered campaign advice. Read the rest here.
