EXPLICIT LANGUAGE WARNING]  Monday on CNN’s "Wolf," the host of CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS, said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is a "bullshit artist. " Zakaria  said, "There is a pattern here Wolf every time it is demonstrated that Donald Trump is plainly ignorant about some basic public policy issue, some well known fact, he comes back with the certain bravado and tries to explain it away with a tweet or statement. He did it on the Brexit, and the nuclear triad, and also he thought that Tim Kaine was the governor of New Jersey and now with this. And so now it is amusing to watch how he is going to be pulling it off this time, and what is he going to be arguing, usually he adds that the press hates him. There is a  term for this kind of thing, this is the mode of a bullshit artist. Sometimes it is amusing and entertaining, and if the guy is trying to sell you a condo or a car, but for the president of the United States, it is deeply worrying.
