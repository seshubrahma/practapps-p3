Washington, D. C.  —   Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump declared at the Value Voters Summit on Friday that the migrant crisis from the Middle East and North Africa could be the "  great Trojan Horse. "[Speaking to a crowd of mostly Christian, Republican activists at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, he rattled through the top issues of the day, looking more comfortable delivering prepared remarks.  "President Obama," he said, "has allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more. But it’s almost impossible to get a Christian in from Syria. " "They take others but they don’t take Christians. Very rare, very rare," he added, "So I said that we need to take safe zones, we want to take care of people but we absolutely cannot allow this potential, tremendous threat to continue and we have to stop this. " "This is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country. It’s from within, it could be the   great Trojan Horse. " He pivoted onto describing the wave of migrants, many of whom pretend they are from Syria when in fact they are from Iraq, Afghanistan, or across North Africa. "Did you ever notice?" he asked, "you look at the migration trail and see people with cell phones. Some of the cell phones have the ISIS flag. Printed on them. Some of them have things far worse than that. " He made reference to the fact that some cell phones owned by migrants have been found to contain pictures and video of   beheadings.
