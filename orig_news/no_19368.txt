’  ’ "   The world’s biggest hedge fund thinks stock markets around the   world will tank if Donald Trump wins the US presidential   election. " ’   Bridgewater Associates expects a 10. 4% drop in the US equities   market should Trump win the presidency, according to an investor   note sent Tuesday obtained by Business Insider. ’ ’   ’ ’   The numbers represent the hedge fund’’s "updated rough   estimates of the likely market action depending on the election   result," Bridgewater said.  ’ "   The note, written by the firm’s   investment officer   Greg Jensen, Jason Rotenberg and Jeff Amato, made clear that they   were not taking a political stance on either of the candidates. " ’’ ’   "We are global macro investors, not political experts," the trio   wrote. Bridgewater manages about $150 billion firmwide. ’ ’   Other equity markets that would plummet on a Trump win: European   equity markets by 10. 8% Japan by 9% and China by 11. 4%   the note said. ’ ’   A Clinton win, on the other hand, would boost those markets in   the low single digits, the note said. ’ ’   "The impact of a Trump win is larger because the odds of a Trump   victory are currently smaller," the note said.  ’ ’   The hedge fund also expects: ’ ’   In the short term, the hedge fund expects it would experience   investment losses equivalent to a bad month if Trump wins,   calling it "a manageable loss." The note added that a Clinton win   would mean the firm would "likely net a modest gain." ’ ’   "Over time, we expect to capture the effects of either Trump’’s or   Clinton’’s policies on markets and economies and adjust our views   accordingly," the note said.  ’ "   Bridgewater’s external PR firm Prosek Partners didn’t immediately   respond to a request for comment.
