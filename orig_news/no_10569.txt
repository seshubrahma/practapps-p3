Wednesday at a rally in Abingdon, VA, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump joked about his opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s claims she only deleted personal emails on her private server about things like yoga classes.  In 2015 at a press conference, Clinton said "After I left office, the State Department asked former secretaries of state for our assistance in providing copies of   related emails from our personal accounts. I responded right away and provided all my emails that could possibly be   which totaled roughly 55, 000 printed pages, even though I knew that the State Department already had the vast majority of them. We went through a thorough process to identify all of my   related emails and deliver them to the State Department. At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal emails  —   emails about planning Chelsea’s wedding or my mother’s funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes. " Today, Trump joked, "Yesterday a thousand came out, or something, some fairly vast number. Oh, I want to see the ones  —   what I really would like to see though  —   we have to see the 33, 000. Can you imagine? Remember she said, I think it was for her wedding, the wedding of Chelsea, and it was for yoga classes, 33, 000  . That’s a lot of yoga. That’s a lot of yoga.
