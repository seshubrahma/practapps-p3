A new   poll shows that Donald Trump is now leading North Carolina by seven points ahead of Hillary Clinton  —   51 percent to Clinton’s 44 percent. [That means that Trump has shockingly flipped his numbers in the state in just one month. Three weeks ago, Clinton was leading Trump by two points in the same poll  —   46 percent to 44 percent.  Trump has now passed the 50 percent threshold, according to the poll, making it unlikely that Clinton will be able to bounce back. The poll was conducted after the news that the FBI would revisit the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server. Clinton has campaigned furiously in North Carolina in recent weeks, trying to keep the state from going for Trump in 2016. The state went for Romney in 2012 but went for Obama in 2008. Both First Lady Michelle Obama and President Barack Obama have campaigned in the state’s more populated areas, urging supporters to back Hillary Clinton. Clinton and Michelle Obama made headlines after campaigning together in the state last week. Actress Lena Dunham also campaigned in the state over the weekend for Clinton. President Obama plans to campaign in the state Wednesday with singer song writer James Taylor.
