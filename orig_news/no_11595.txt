As always, Hollywood was watching as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders claimed victory in the     primary in New Hampshire Tuesday night and were quick to weigh in on social media with hot takes, sarcastic congratulations, vulgar jokes and utter confusion. [The prize for vulgar celebrity tweet of the night goes to   Michael Ian Black, who wondered aloud whether New Hampshire’s   finisher Marco Rubio would perform a sex act on Trump to secure a vice presidential spot.  Serious question: would Marco Rubio suck Trump’s dick to get on the ticket?  —   Michael Ian Black (@michaelianblack) February 10, 2016,  Devoted Sanders supporters Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon, Alyssa Milano, and other celebrities peppered in tweets praising the socialist from Vermont’s commanding win: Vote @BernieSanders to win congress and down ticket races!
