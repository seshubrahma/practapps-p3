’All of us like to believe that, if other people paid only more attention and understood the issues better, then they would agree with our   positions on politics.’ ’But the left indulges in this idea more than the right.’ ’For example, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told Rachel Maddow on Wednesday that, if the media held only Republicans accountable, then they would get just "5, 10% of the vote.
