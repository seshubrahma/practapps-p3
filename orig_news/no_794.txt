"The film will show prehistoric monsters fighting one another and making weird sounds," The Times reported before the release, calling it a "fantastic film. " It also helped define the career of Bruce Cabot, who played Jack Driscoll, the hero who rescues Fay Wray from the giant ape. Mr. Cabot’s career didn’t start in acting school. At 14, he scavenged cattle remains on the prairies of New Mexico for bone meal. Work in construction "gave him a democratic outlook on life," The Times wrote in 1933. As a ship deckhand, he worked his way to Europe and meandered through   War I France and Spain. After "King Kong," a series of supporting roles followed, often alongside John Wayne. World War II military service took him back to Europe, where he worked in intelligence. That may have prepared him for one of his last roles: Fighting a fictitious spy named James Bond in "Diamonds Are Forever.
