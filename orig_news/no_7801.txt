" He says what he is doing is about them and their future. He said his whole career was about giving children a second chance and it has been so wonderful to see people he has operated on on the campaign trail. Carson says anybody who tells him that something inside a uterus is just a bunch of useless cells has "no idea what they’re talking about" after describing a woman he operated on when she was in her mother’s womb. Carson urges the remaining candidates to not injure the Republican brand weakening the potential nominee in the general election. 5:45: Carson says the GOP candidates are not addressing the "fiscal gap. " He says he is not a politician so he can talk about unfunded liabilities vs. the money that we have coming back in through taxes and other revenue sources. He says nobody talks about the $200 trillion fiscal gap. 5:43: Carson says he would prefer in general not to have one but there is a reason that the process is in place. Carson says he would have a problem, though, if someone started changing the rules. Carson points out that he has "millions" of supporters when the questioner asks him where his "thousands" of supporters should go. Carson says he has heard from supporters that they will not vote if he is not on the ticket. He doesn’t like hearing that because not voting is actually voting for the other side and giving Hillary Clinton up to four Supreme Court picks. Carson says people need to exercise their civic duty because we will have done our children in if we choose another "secular progressive. " 5:35: Carson said he did the math, looked at the delegate counts and realized that "it simply wasn’t going to happen. " He said he didn’t want to "interfere with the process. " Carson says it is sad that the most common question he got from the international press was "aren’t you embarrassed. " He blames the media for trying to stir up fights instead of being interested in answers, solutions. Carson says the media are more interested in ratings. He says he has talked to all of the remaining candidates this week and he asked them to rise above the noise and discuss policy issues. 5:30: Carson: People Love Me but ‘They Won’t Vote for Me.’ Tells CPAC He’s ‘Leaving Campaign Trail’ Dr. Ben Carson tells CPAC people tend to make bad decisions when they are angry and fearful.

" Carson says he will still continue to be heavily involved in trying to save our nation. Carson will head My Faith Votes, an organization that will focus on getting Christian voters to the polls. He says Obama doesn’t get to decide whether we’re a   nation and blasts him for saying that America isn’t a   nation. Carson says we cannot allow ourselves to get molded by the political class and the media. "That is going to destroy us. " Carson says it is kinda sad because the press is the only business that is protected by the Constitution. He says they were supposed to be allies of the people and not take sides like they have done. Carson asks the younger members of the press not to be "captured" by those who want to implement a radical agenda and calls on them to be fair. Carson says he can enjoy the rest of his life in luxury but he can’t knowing that the next generation is in trouble and he will do everything he can to preserve the greatness of America. 5:12: Cruz says the media are not reporting that his campaign has won young people in states like Iowa, South Carolina, Arkansas, Texas. And he says the Washington establishment is terrified of the people gathered here. He says if he wins the nomination, he will unite the party, defeat Clinton, and turn the country around. 5:02: Hannity asks Cruz how he will deal with Democrats who will try to label Republicans as racist, sexist, homophobic. When asked how he will deal with the predictable lies, Cruz talks about "projection. " Cruz says Democrats are unwilling to say "all lives matter" and asks "when did it become controversial to say every human being is a precious gift from God and we value everybody?"  …     Regarding "Black Lives Matter," Cruz says the bravery of our policies officers has saved thousands of black lives. He says "blue lives matter" and we stand with the men and women who protect us. Cruz says you have to take the case right to Democrats and he "cannot wait to stand on that general election stage with Hillary Clinton. " Cruz says Clinton will prattle on about income inequality and he will tell her that it has increased dramatically under her policies. Cruz says "I agree with Bernie Sanders" after he says that he will say a sentence that has never been aid at CPAC and promises that it won’t be   because he is not Donald Trump. Cruz says Sanders is right in defining the problem re: how Washington is fundamentally corrupt. Cruz says where he disagrees with Bernie is if problem is government is corrupt, "then the answer ain’t let’s have a whole bunch more government. " 5:00: What happened to his   guarantee?

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2016,  4:51: Cruz tells Hannity at CPAC that Romney is "entitled to express his views" as a citizen but the concerns Romney expressed are those that people have all over the country. Cruz says we will lose the Supreme Court for a generation if Trump is the nominee because Clinton will win the White House. Cruz says "Super Tuesday" was a "clarifying moment. " He says he is the only one who has repeatedly beaten Trump. Cruz says the establishment is frustrated because the voters keep rejecting their "golden children. " Cruz says there will be a "manifest revolt" if there is a brokered convention —  Cruz says you beat Donald Trump by beating him with the voters. 4:48: At CPAC, Cruz says it took Jimmy Carter to give us Ronald Reagan and Obama’s lasting legacy will be creating a new generation of leaders who stand and fight for liberty, who stands and fight for the Constitution, and who stand and fight for the   values that built this great nation. 4:45: Cruz says we’ll have a president willing to utter the words "radical Islamic terrorism. " He says one of the most disgraceful things we’ve seen over the last seven years is sending soldiers into combat with rules on engagement that ties their hands behind their backs. He says it is "immoral, wrong" and will end when he becomes president. He also says if we have to go to war, we should use "overwhelming force" and "get the heck out. " 4:40: Cruz slams Trump for skipping CPAC, but he points out that the is "angry: too: Cruz: "I get being angry, I’m angry too."  —   Betsy Klein (@betsy_klein) March 4, 2016,  CRUZ at CPAC:"So Donald Trump is skipping CPAC.

Shaw, who is a black American, points out that his son was being recruited by schools like Stanford and Rutgers to play football and was a good student. He says his son was on the cusp of doing something really good when an illegal immigrant gang member shot his son in the head a day after he was released from jail. Shaw trusts Trump to enforce the country’s immigration laws. Shaw says when he heard Trump talk about illegal immigrant "rapists" in his announcement speech, he supported him but thought Trump was being too nice because "murderers" like the illegal immigrant who killed his son are worse than "rapists. " Baldwin has a look of shock on her face. Baldwin, speaking to a black American, has to get in her talking points about how "critics" says Trump is a "xenophobe" and has "offended every section of humanity. " Baldwin actually asks Shaw if he hesitated when the Trump campaign asked him to be featured in one of their ads for fear that the campaign may be "politicizing" his son’s death. Quite telling that Baldwin never brings up the "politicization" concerns when   zealots advocate for gun control. But all of a sudden she cares about "politicization" when a black American is denouncing illegal immigrant crime. Shaw says he has been to D. C. three times and spoken to various lawmakers and "none of them give a damn. " He asks Baldwin what she would do if her son got murdered by an illegal immigrant  …     Shaw says Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and every other politician have all said they would enforce the country’s illegal immigration laws but have done nothing. 3:30: Bern Force One and Trump Force One on the runway: #BernForceOne touches down in Michigan  …    with a little company on the runway. pic. twitter.   —   Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) March 4, 2016,  3:20: Associated Press eviscerates Carson’s campaign spending:  The political newcomer, who plans to announce Friday afternoon that he will become chairman of a group that encourages Christians to vote, raised $58 million, more money than any other GOP contender raised. But an Associated Press review of his campaign finance filings show Carson’s campaign is an extreme example of the   business of presidential politics. His campaign burned through the millions he raised by spending more on fundraising and consultants than on mass media advertising,    employees and other things that could have swayed voters, the filings show, 3:18: Kasich’s CPAC speech: 3:15: Newt: Good strategy for Trump to skip CPAC: Trump was right to skip CPAC.
