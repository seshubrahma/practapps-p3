’  ’ ’   Bernie Sanders is a   socialist who railed against   the power of the wealthy elite during his 2016 presidential run. ’ ’   But despite that, he does not support the alternative minimum   tax, which was enacted with the intention of making sure the uber   rich pay their fair share of taxes. ’ "   The tax made headlines this week when MSNBC revealed President   Donald Trump’s 2005 tax return. That’s because it cost the   president nearly $31 million.  " ’   One way to look at the alternative minimum tax or AMT is as   a secondary tax code. It has a set of rates and rules that   are distinct from the regular tax code and apply to certain     earners, trusts, estates, and corporations. So when   corporations or individuals fall under the auspices of the AMT,   their tax bills are figured out differently than those of   ordinary taxpayers. ’ ’   The point of the AMT is to make sure wealthy Americans who earn   above a certain amount pay a flat minimum tax rate  —   hence the   name  —   even if they could get away with paying zero or very   little taxes in the regular system. But many opponents of the tax   say it now targets people in the   class, not the    . ’ ’’ "   Sanders does support a repeal of the alternative minimum tax, but   that doesn’t mean he thinks the wealthy should get away with   paying as little taxes as possible. " ’   The tax plan Sanders proposed during the 2016 presidential   election called for a repeal of AMT. But it also called for a   number of "provisions aimed at   households" that would   essentially do what the AMT was intended to do: make sure the   extremely wealthy pay their fair share. ’ ’   According to the Tax Foundation: ’ ’Bernie Sanders is a   socialist. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
