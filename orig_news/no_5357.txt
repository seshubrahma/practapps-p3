Saturday in an "AM Joy" discussion about Snoop Dogg’s new music video where the rapper shoots a clown version of President Donald Trump, MSNBC contributor Toure said that Trump is too much of a joke for anyone to be concerned about Snoop Dogg shooting him in a joke video.  "Now we see that there is anger at this president and he represents a lot of anger that a lot of black people have, but you can’t take him really seriously because he is a clown. He is a joke," Toure told host Joy Reid. "To really shoot him in a video would be like, why are you going that far? This man isn’t worthy of all that. So, of course, he makes it a joke," he added. "There is a lot of anger about him, but he is so ridiculous that he becomes a joke. " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
