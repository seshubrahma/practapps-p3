"The party leadership could make more progress if they focused on building bridges instead of burning them. " Fehrnstrom noted that Romney won six of 10 contests on Super Tuesday four years ago. In the Super Tuesday contests that took place this week, Trump won seven of 11 states. "What usually happens right now is the party rallies behind the presumptive nominee," Fehrnstrom said.

For all the GOP  ’s flaws, many veteran Democrats are beginning to conclude, Donald Trump is a canny operator who just might end up in the White House if they’re not careful. He appears to be cracking the code with white   voters who could help him put blue Rust Belt states in play against Hillary Clinton. He’s helping to fuel record turnout in GOP primaries and he’s mastered the media like no candidate in recent memory, with his constant feeding of catnip to cable TV and his   missiles on Twitter. "It’s fair to say there’s been a graveyard already out there of people underestimating him," said Doug Sosnik, a former Bill Clinton White House adviser. "And I am old enough to remember the sort of Democratic intelligentsia that was hoping Ronald Reagan would be nominated by Republicans in 1980 because everyone knew he was a doddering old right winger who could never get elected president. " "So there is some danger to underestimating his candidacy," Sosnik said. "Having said that, I have enough confidence in the judgment of the American people to never elect someone like Donald Trump president of the United States.
