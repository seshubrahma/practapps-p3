Tuesday at a stop on his "Thank You" tour in West Allis, WI,   Donald Trump opened up his appearance by fulfilling a campaign promise regarding the use of "Merry Christmas" as a holiday greeting.  "So when I started 18 months ago, I told my first crowd in Wisconsin that we are going to come back here someday and we are going to say merry Christmas again," Trump said. "Merry Christmas  â€”   so, merry Christmas everyone. Happy New Year, but Merry Christmas. And I am here today for one main reason: to say thank you to the people of Wisconsin.
