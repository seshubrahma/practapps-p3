UPDATE  —   Statement from a Fox News spokesperson: "Megyn Kelly has no conflict of interest. Donald Trump is just trying to build up the audience for Thursday’s debate, for which we thank him. "  *** GOP frontrunner Donald Trump argues that Fox News’s Megyn Kelly shouldn’t moderate the upcoming debate on January 28 in Iowa, three days before the Iowa caucus. "Based on @MegynKelly’s conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate," Trump posted to Twitter on Saturday. Kelly was criticized for being unfair to Trump following the first GOP primary debate. And two days ago, Kelly was charged with unleashing "on Donald Trump and Sarah Palin," who recently endorsed the GOP frontrunner. "Breaking tonight, a moment with the potential to change the Republican race for the White House  —   or not," Kelly sarcastically announced, referencing Palin’s endorsement of Trump. Kelly also featured the "National Review Against Trump" story, having several of the   commentators on her show, which resulted in the National Review being dumped from   an upcoming GOP primary debate.
