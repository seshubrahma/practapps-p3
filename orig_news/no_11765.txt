Hillary Clinton sharply criticized Donald Trump during a campaign rally Tuesday, portraying him as an economic liability and untrustworthy when it comes to his top strength, business. ["You might think that because he has spent his life as a businessman, he’d be better prepared to handle the economy," Clinton told supporters in Columbus, Ohio. "Well it turns out, he’s dangerous there too. Just like he shouldn’t have his finger on the button, he shouldn’t have his hands on our economy. "  Clinton argued that interests on both sides of the aisle oppose Trump’s economic plans, saying that both the Chamber of Commerce and labor unions as well as Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) and former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney all think the Trump plan would be "disastrous" and "throw us back into recession. " According to Clinton, Trump’s tax plan would increase the national debt, his way of business would put America’s reputation at risk, and his immigration plan would shrink the economy. Hitting Trump on multiple fronts, Clinton blasted the business man for his "America first" trade plans while producing merchandise in countries outside the U. S. "Interestingly, Trump’s own products are made in a lot of countries that aren’t named America: Trump ties are made in China. Trump suits in Mexico. Trump furniture in Turkey. Trump picture frames in India. Trump barware in Slovenia," she said. Beyond his economic plans, Clinton took on Trump for his numerous lawsuits and past bankruptcies. "He’s written a lot of books about business. They all seem to end at Chapter 11," she said. "Go figure. " "We cannot let him bankrupt America like we are one of his failed casinos," Clinton added. "We cannot let him roll the dice with our children’s futures. Leading an economy as large and complex as ours creating growth that is strong, fair, and lasting is about as hard of a job as there is. It takes patience and clear thinking. "
