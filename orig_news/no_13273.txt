  Donald Trump has stated his commitment to helping California’s farmers attain more water, as the Golden State prepares to enter its historic sixth year of a crippling drought, with a federal water policy in place that favors fish over agriculture. [However, the authority of California’s state agencies over the allocation of its water supply  —   which includes the federal Central Valley Project  —   remains a staggering obstacle the nation’s 45th president must confront. Particularly, as the Sacramento Bee points out, when it comes to the   Joaquin Delta, which is where the endangered Delta smelt primarily reside.  Over a year ago, Fresno County farmer Wayne Western Jr. penned a letter to Trump pleading for help. His farm, like many others in his situation, could go out of business if nothing is done to address the water situation. According to the Bee, Trump replied with a handwritten pledge, writing: "Got it  —   crazy. If I win, it will be corrected quickly. "
