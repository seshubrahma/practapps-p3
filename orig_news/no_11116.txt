Pinal County, AZ Sheriff and Congressional candidate Paul Babeu (R) reacted to Vice President Joe Biden saying he almost felt obliged to apologize to the Mexico for some campaign rhetoric by stating "why don’t they stop right there, and turn to the American people, and apologize to us?" on Friday’s "Your World with Neil Cavuto" on the Fox News Channel.  Babeu said, "Well, the apology tour continues by Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And why don’t they stop right there, and turn to the American people, and apologize to us? Apologize to the thousands of Americans and families who have victims, their own sons and daughters, moms and dads who have been killed by some of these illegals, these criminals? Never once have they talked to the parents of murdered children here in my state, and yet they would gladly apologize in a second to the leaders of Mexico, to leaders in Europe. And finally, we need leaders like Donald Trump, or whoever the Republican nominee is, that stands up for America, and finally puts american families, our security, our military first for once. And that’s what we haven’t had these past eight years now. " He added, "[T]hey try to shout down Americans. We are law abiding citizens, pay our taxes. We want the government to put us first, and instead they have wide open borders, and we have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of illegals. And not enforcing the law. The only thing it does is it’s a billboard sign on the border, neon flashing saying, ‘Make it to the border and you’re home free.’ We’ve got to start enforcing the law, start having consequences for breaking the immigration law, and a president who understands the Constitution, that he needs congress, he needs to enforce the laws of the land.
