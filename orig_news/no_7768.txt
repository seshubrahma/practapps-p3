Jason Johnson, political editor for The Root, addressed the polls showing that Donald Trump is only getting two percent of   voters, and reasoned the numbers are so low for Trump because the GOP presidential nominee has associated himself with the Ku Klux Klan and alienated  .  "The problem is Donald Trump has associated himself with the Ku Klux Klan. Donald Trump has said hostile things about Black Lives Matter. He has consistently said things that have alienated the black community, and rather than addressing those things and saying, ‘Let’s reach out to the black Republicans and tell them there’s still a space for them,’ they’re treated as if somehow black people haven’t been hearing what he’s saying over the last year and a half," Johnson told Sean Jackson, chairman of the Florida Black Republican Caucus.
