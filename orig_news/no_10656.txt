The latest episode of Saturday Night Live saw its ratings drop to a season low with the return of host Kristen Wiig and actor Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump. [Saturday’s installment of SNL drew 4. 7 million overall household viewers and 2. 2 million among the     demographic. Those numbers are down substantially from last week’s overall and   viewership of 6. 2 million and 3. 9 million, respectfully.  The show featured Baldwin as   Trump, so ignorant of foreign policy that he had to Google the meaning of ISIS. The "Weekend Update" segment of the show was used to mock Breitbart News and its former chairman, Steve Bannon. Last week’s show saw iconic comedian Dave Chappelle host SNL for the first time. It was also the first show to air since   Donald Trump historic election. In October, during the premiere of SNL’s 42nd season, Baldwin debuted his Trump impression alongside actress Kate McKinnon, who impersonated Hillary Clinton. As the presidential campaign heated up, so too did SNL’s ratings. However, if past is prologue, SNL is set to see a   ratings slump (a similar phenomenon occurred over the weekend during Sunday Night Football and the American Music Awards).
