Chris Christie attended the first intelligence briefing with the GOP nominee. Stephen Miller, National Policy Director to the Trump campaign, released the following statement to reporters and a full list of attendees: Today, Mr. Trump convened a meeting of some of the top foreign policy and national security experts in the country to discuss how to win the war against Radical Islamic Terrorism. The participants talked about improving immigration screening and standards to keep out radicals, working with moderate Muslims to foster reforms, and partnering with friendly regimes in the Middle East to stamp out ISIS. This is a stark contrast to Hillary Clinton who wants to bring in 620, 000 refugees with no way to screen them, who refuses to say radical Islam, and who bears direct responsibility for the rise of ISIS with her disastrous interventions overseas. The list of participants in the "Roundtable on Defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism" included: General Mike Flynn, General Keith Kellogg, Senator Jeff Sessions, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Congressman Peter King, Rich Higgins, Congressman Lou Barletta, Congressman Chris Collins, Congressman Tom Marino, the Honorable Michael Mukasey, Andy McCarthy, Chairman Mike McCaul, Mark Krikorian, Congressman Peter Hoekstra, James Carafano, and Kiron Skinner.
