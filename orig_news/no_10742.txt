Wisconsin could   the race for the GOP nomination, according to pollster and president of the Sen. Ted Cruz   Super PAC "Keep the Promise," Kellyanne Conway. [She tells Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon that she has thought all along that if Cruz could get businessman Donald Trump in a    race, he could win.  Said Conway, "It would no longer be the establishment versus the   because the establishment is gone. It would be Trump versus     …     hedging the bet that the   vote share is a majority and the place where you have the most growth opportunity. " As for Wisconsin, it "  the race because it’s the upper Midwest. It should be a sweet spot for John Kasich. It’s a place where Mr. Trump has already won contests. " Conway’s larger point is that beating Kasich in Wisconsin significantly undermines the basic premise for his campaign and by besting Trump, Cruz could be seen as the emerging leader of the two remaining viable candidates going into the convention. Conway also admitted that Trump voters tend to support him early and are "incredibly loyal," but claimed Cruz is getting late breaking voters, while also picking up a number of voters from candidates who have dropped out of the race. She also cited the Cruz campaign’s much talked about infrastructure as positioned to help him down the streth. "Having a vaunted ground game and data analytics at his side is incredibly important. You can’t invent it over night. They’ve been working on it for years and it has mostly succeeded. She also cited Cruz as a candidate who "fits the times for those for the times one who want the outsider with the insider knowledge and experience. Ted Cruz took elective office for the first time in his forties, not his twenties, like a Rubio or Walker and has certainly stood up to leaders of both parties in Washington," said Conway.
