INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  —   Assailing each other with no letup, Republican   Donald Trump and challenger Ted Cruz traded insults, charges and more as Indiana voters went to the polls in what could be an    presidential primary election. [At daybreak Tuesday, Trump was on television rehashing unsubstantiated claims that the Texan’s father, Rafael Cruz, appeared in a 1963 photograph with John F. Kennedy’s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald  —   citing a report first published by the National Enquirer.  "His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald’s being, you know, shot," Trump said on Fox  Friends. "Nobody even brings it up I mean they don’t even talk about that. " Responding, Cruz called his father his "hero," and labeled Trump an "amoral" liar. He launched his own blistering attack against Trump as voters cast ballots in Indiana on Tuesday, likening him to a fictitious character he described as "a braggadocious, arrogant buffoon" and contending the nation could face disastrous times if he is elected.  "We are not a proud, boastful,     hateful, bullying nation," Cruz said in Evansville, with his wife Heidi and running mate Carly Fiorina by his side. "If Indiana does not act, this country could well plunge into the abyss. "
