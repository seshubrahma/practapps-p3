Bush and President Trump to Adolph Hitler, will argue on Thursday that students at Berkeley should actively resist the presence of conservative speakers like Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos, who have both had events canceled at the school after violence from leftist protesters. Members of the Berkeley College Republicans had trouble arranging events with speakers David Horowitz and Ann Coulter after university administrators placed unusual restrictions on their events, such as forcing them to take place far from the main center of campus and forcing them to be held during regular class hours. For Coulter’s event, law enforcement claimed that there would be a 99 percent chance of violence if the event were to have taken place. Taylor’s event is set to proceed as originally scheduled.
