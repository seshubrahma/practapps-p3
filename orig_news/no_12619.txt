Sunday on NBC’s "Meet the Press," Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said during the campaign   Donald Trump "said outrageous things and he needs to apologize to the American people. "  Sanders said, "Let us be very clear, Chuck. When Donald Trump helped lead the birther movement, that was nothing less than a racist effort to undermine the legitimacy of the first   president we ever had. That was racist. That was disgraceful. The   community and all of us deserve an apology. When he talks about Latinos or Mexicans as criminals and rapists, that is outrageous. When he says that people who are Muslims cannot enter the United States, that’s an outrage. On those issues, let me be clear, speaking for only myself, there is no compromise. " He added, "He’s said outrageous things and he needs to apologize to the American people. There are people all over this country who are really frightened. " Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
