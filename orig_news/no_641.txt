It’s not clear whether the Malaysian autopsy results will be made public. _____ • In environmental news, a Greenpeace report tied the toxic waves of air pollution sweeping northern China to an increase in already excessive steel production last year, made counter to promised cuts.

A. staff members. _____ • Snapchat’s parent company is aiming for a valuation of more than $20 billion as it nears what’s expected to be the biggest initial public offering in the tech world since Alibaba and Facebook. • Speaking of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg posted a   update of his founder’s statement that expressed alarm over growing rejections of globalism and argued that "progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community. " • Asian financial conglomerates, including SoftBank of Japan or HNA Group of China, are scouring the U. S. for management expertise to help them invest their cash stockpiles. • European markets ended a   rally. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • The Islamic State claimed a suicide attack on a dance celebration at a Sufi shrine in Pakistan’s Sindh Province that killed at least 70 worshipers and injured more than 250.

This week in Australia, the Perth World Super 6 is debuting a format  —   a   last round, with match play and a special hole  —   to adapt the sport to changing times. Happy Birthday to Michael Jordan. The basketball legend turns 54 today. He won’t be competing at this weekend’s N. B. A.   dunk contest, but three decades ago he helped elevate the competition with   slams from the   line. Jordan’s seemingly effortless flights to the basket made him one of the most instantly recognizable faces in the world.
