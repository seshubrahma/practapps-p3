On Monday’s Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Alex Marlow asked for Deputy Assistant to the President Dr. Sebastian Gorka’s assessment of radical Islam and its position in the world today, compared to its influence on the morning of September 11, 2001. "Is radical Islam stronger now as a movement, or has it been weakened since  ?" he asked. ["Superb question," Gorka replied. "And the answer is unequivocally, without a doubt, much much stronger. "  "Just think about one metric. Let’s look at ISIS. ISIS, the Islamic State, has achieved that which no other jihadi group has been able to do in 90 years since the dissolution of the Caliphate by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1924. He fired the caliph, he dissolved the Caliphate, when he created the secular republic of Turkey. For 90 years, the bad guys  —     included  —   have tried to   a theocratic Caliphate. ISIS didn’t talk about it. They did it," he noted. "They did it in 2014 from the pulpit of the Grand Mosque in Mosul," he continued. "According to our own counterterrorism center  —   this is open source  —   ISIS has 18 operational affiliates around the world. Compare that to just three years ago, when they had seven. They are getting stronger. " "This is why it’s very important to understand, we’re not at war with Islam, but there is a war inside Islam, for which version is going to win. And right now, it’s the wrong version," he warned. "It’s the   atavistic bloodcurdling version that is represented by the Islamic State. The version that is portrayed by Jordan, by Egypt, by the Emiratis, that needs our support because we cannot see the Islamic State expand any more. That is why the president used the phrase, ‘We are going to eradicate the Islamic State. ’" Gorka said there were two important conclusions to draw from the foreign policy speech President Trump gave in Youngstown, Ohio, during the campaign, principles that continue to shape his policy outlook since the election. "Number one, it’s very clear, he’s given the generals 30 days to come up with a war plan to defeat the Islamic State, as the epitome of the threat right now  —   destroy it in theater with our allies, with our partners," he said. "But that’s the smaller part. We’re the most powerful nation the world has ever seen. We can do that relatively easily. " "  victory, if you read General Flynn’s book, you’ll see this explicitly laid out," he continued, referring to The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies by retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who is now national security adviser to President Trump’s. "  victory comes when people don’t want to become jihadis anymore. " He said this would require a longer and more difficult   strategy to "delegitimize the narrative of jihad. " "Just as Ronald Reagan undermined the narrative of the communists, we have to help our allies, the Sunnis of the region, make the totalitarian ideology of the jihadists look hollow and crumble in upon itself," Gorka urged. "The larger part of our task is to have a very, very     campaign, which means the Islam of our allies against the Islam of groups like the Islamic State. " Dr. Sebastian Gorka is the author of the   book Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War and was national security editor for Breitbart News before joining the Trump administration.
