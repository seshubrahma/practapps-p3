Wednesday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," political correspondent Kasie Hunt said the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is describing Indiana is the candidate’s "Alamo. "  Hunt said, "Nice to see both of you this fine morning. Look they are presenting this as the Alamo. They say universally, privately, publicly even, Indiana is it. They are going to take the stand I think that there is a slim chance that if Cruz pulls that out there are going to be at least some people who stay on his side, are willing to watch him push it through to California. But you’re right. Indiana is not Wisconsin. Cruz at the very least needs it to be Wisconsin. You’ve got all these top elected officials, Mike Pence, Mitch Daniels, other people sitting on the sidelines. Talk radio has been neutral. There are pockets of Indiana that have been hard hit by the economic crisis. There are manufacturing areas that are essentially perfect for Donald Trump. This is nowhere near a sure thing for Ted Cruz. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
