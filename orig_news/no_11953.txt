Gen. Jerry Boykin, executive vice president of the Family Research Council, discussed the 2016 Values Voter Summit, which takes place September 9  —   11 in Washington, D. C. with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow, saying, "What I think we’re going to see here this weekend is a lot more people become comfortable with the   ticket. "[Added Boykin:  If you notice what Donald Trump has been doing recently, stayed on message, he has followed a lot of good advice from the people around him.   …     So I think we’re going to have a lot of people coming in still questioning whether they’re going to support Trump, and I think it’s going to be an opportunity for them to be convinced that the guy will make a much better president than Hillary. There just are no perfect candidates. More on the Values Voter Summit is here: Values Voter Summit was created in 2006 to provide a forum to help inform and mobilize citizens across America to preserve the bedrock values of traditional marriage, religious liberty, sanctity of life and limited government that make our nation strong. It has drawn over 3, 000 plus attendees from around the nation and foreign countries. Garnering national and international media attention, CNN named it "one of the conservative movement’s marquee annual events" and Sean Hannity called it "the premier conservative event now in the country.
