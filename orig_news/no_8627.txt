While Americans as a whole were handing Donald Trump a historic presidential win, residents of Maine were defeating an    push to increase gun control by expanding background checks. [The push was embodied in Question 3, a ballot initiative that would have required Maine residents to go through a background check before letting a friend borrow a gun for hunting. It would have also forced   citizens to pay a fee for the background check, effectively taxing them for loaning a gun to a friend.  Question 3 was sponsored by Michael   Everytown for Gun Safety, and WCSH 6 reports that it "failed" to pass. According to the Bangor Daily News, "By any measure, it’s a stunning victory for what David Trahan, the executive director of the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine, called a group of ‘ragtag volunteers. ’" It’s a victory that proves "you can win on an issue without money   …     at the   level. " Franklin County Sheriff Scott Nichols also fought against Question 3. He appeared in a television ad, where he stressed that "background checks are ‘already’ [the] law and that [an expansion] wouldn’t stop criminals, but it would rather create them out of otherwise   Mainers. " In other words, background checks for retail sales have been the law of the land since 1998, and expanding those checks to private sales would only criminalize   Mainers who refused to comply with new fee requirements and more government oversight on gun sales.
