CLEVELAND, Ohio  —   Donald Trump made history on Wednesday night, not just by accepting his party’s presidential nomination, and not just by delivering the longest speech in party convention history, but also by embracing both gays and evangelical Christians in the same address. [Trump stood up for gays against radical Islamic terrorism, and later thanked evangelicals, promising to repeal the Johnson Amendment, which prevents churches from endorsing political candidates.  The relevant portions of Trump’s speech follow. First, his comments on protecting the gay community: Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community. No good, and we’re gonna stop it. As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me. Later, his comments thanking evangelicals: At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I’ll tell you what, the support they’ve given me, and I’m not sure I totally deserve it, has been so awesome and has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. True, so true. They have much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment which, by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their   status if they openly advocate their political views. I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. Note the touch of humility in his appeal to evangelicals: "I’m not sure I totally deserve it. " The crowd liked that one. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
