"Fox  Friends" put Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton running mate Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) on blast Friday for making media rounds without speaking on their show.  On Thursday, Kaine appeared on NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN and MSNBC, criticizing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his visit with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. "It’s laughable that Tim Kaine said that Donald Trump   …     choked in not telling the Mexican president [about payment for the wall],"   Brian Kilmeade said. "Really? This is the Tim Kaine that   …     refuses to come on our show yesterday, because I guess he projected the questions would be too tough, and he’s saying Donald Trump choked because when he first met the president of Mexico —  and by the way, Donald Trump’s not president yet. He didn’t say, here’s the invoice. " Tucker Carlson then asked if Kaine would have been happier if "Trump had yelled at the Mexican president. " "What does he want Trump to do?" Carlson said while laughing.   Ainsley Earhardt added that she personally called Kaine to invite him on the show, but was turned down. "Tim Kaine, we would love for you to come on our show. We called them so many times. I personally called them. He wouldn’t come on our show. He did the whole round robin but wouldn’t come on Fox," she said.
