A joint motion was filed Friday morning by the plaintiff states and the defendants, including the United States, in the executive amnesty litigation. The movants write, "the parties have met and conferred and have reached agreement on how to proceed in this case. " They want a stay until exactly one month after   Donald Trump is sworn in. [The turnover in administration and the unique posture of the case —  on return from the U. S. Supreme Court —  are invoked as the two main reasons for requesting the stay.  The motion to stay the merits of the proceeding, attached below, says that the parties jointly move to halt the proceedings, "including the obligation to propose a schedule for resolution of the case, until February 20, 2017. " U. S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen in the Southern District of Texas, issued the order blocking the unilateral federal action in February of 2015, as reported by Breitbart Texas. On appeal from that order, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in November 2015. A tie at the U. S. Supreme Court in June 2016, left in place the injunction of Judge Hanen after the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court ruling, as reported by Breitbart Texas. Breitbart Texas reported in early October that the United States Supreme Court denied President Obama’s request to rehear the executive amnesty case. The federal district court injunction therefore stands. As reported by Breitbart News on Friday morning,   Donald Trump has tapped Senator Jeff Sessions to be his attorney general.
