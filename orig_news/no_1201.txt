 Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Let’s turn it over to Jennifer Medina, a correspondent based in Los Angeles, for today’s introduction. Another day, another example of California’s continued fight with the Trump administration. The State Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation Monday that essentially turns California into a   "sanctuary state" for undocumented immigrants. The bill expands protections for immigrants at a time when the Trump administration has expanded who is considered a priority for deportation. The legislation prohibits any state or local law enforcement agency from using resources to investigate, detain, report or arrest people for immigration violations. Under the legislation, county jails would not be able to allow officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to work inside the jails or notify them when a prisoner is being released. After the bill came under fierce criticism from the California State Sheriffs’ Association, it was amended to allow local law enforcement officials to notify ICE of the release date of serious and violent felons. It also enables local law enforcement officers to alert federal officials if they come across someone who has a violent felony record and has been previously deported. Language in the bill was also changed to explicitly allow local agencies to participate in task forces even if they include immigration enforcement in investigations. The amendments did little to mollify the opposition. One Republican senator warned that the Legislature would be "kicking the president right in the groin," with the law and warned that "he will strike back. " After the vote, Kevin de León, the leader of the state Senate and sponsor of the bill, said, "Our communities will become more, not less, dangerous if local police are enlisted to enforce federal immigration laws. " He called the passage of the bill a "rejection of President Trump’s false and cynical portrayal of undocumented immigrants as a lawless community. " Just before the Senate passed the sanctuary state bill, lawmakers approved legislation to start a fund that would pay for lawyers for undocumented immigrants facing deportation. Several Republicans spoke out against the legislation, saying it was an unfair use of taxpayer money and also contradicted the idea that the state wants to stay out of immigration enforcement. Both bills will now move to the Assembly. Gov. Jerry Brown has not indicated whether he would sign either one.

[The New York Times] Some visitors to Big Sur go bird watching or relax with a novel at a seaside resort. Others suspend themselves high above the Pacific’s crashing waves on a narrow strip of nylon known as a slackline. Billy Rudiger, a reader in Carmel, shared a photo he captured of a slackliner traversing a cove just south of Monterey last November. Rope walking has existed for centuries. But the origins of the modern slackline, flat webbing strung loose enough to bounce like a trampoline, usually between two trees, is traced to Yosemite rock climbers in the early 1980s. It quickly grew into a   sport. In the last five or so years, social media has helped to propel its popularity. The pinnacle of the sport is a variation known as highlining, meaning the line is affixed at height. Highliners wear tethers, though a small number of elite practitioners sometimes go without. Injuries can happen, but they are usually of the sprained ankle variety and involve lines a few feet off the ground, said Sonya Iverson, president of Slackline U. S. a group that promotes the sport. "We aren’t daredevils or " she said. Slackliners talk about the practice as a metaphor for the art of living  —   "balancing everything on the line to demonstrate life’s possibilities," as the famed climber and highliner Dean Potter put it. For Ryan Robinson, 34, the highliner in Mr. Rudiger’s photo, the blue ocean juxtaposed against the jagged rocks represented a cathedral of sorts. "It’s such a beautiful place," he said. "It’s nice to pay respect in a very unique way. " California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com.
