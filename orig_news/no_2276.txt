(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Hillary Clinton released her tax records for 2015, showing that she and her husband paid an effective rate of 35 percent in federal taxes on income of $10. 6 million. The move increased pressure on Donald Trump to reveal his returns, the subject of political and financial speculation. Both candidates added details to their tax policies this week. Mr. Trump would ease business regulations and lower taxes for the wealthy, aiming to boost the economy. Mrs. Clinton would tax the wealthy more heavily and hold the rate for the bottom 95 percent steady. _____ 2. Mr. Trump said he was being sarcastic in labeling President Obama and Mrs. Clinton founders of the Islamic State, comments that appeared to play well at rallies but confused some conservatives. He held two more rallies in Pennsylvania, which has voted Democratic in the last six presidential elections but is crucial to his strategy. Above, Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, introduced him in Erie. Our   podcast today features the   writer Thomas Friedman, discussing his column on Mr. Trump’s "Second Amendment" comment. _____ 3. Katie Ledecky won another gold in Rio, becoming only the second woman to sweep the     and   freestyle races. She broke her own world record in the 800, finishing the race in 8 minutes, 04. 79 seconds. The American Maya DiRado upset Katinka Hosszu in the   backstroke, catching Hosszu near the wall, and Michael Phelps placed second in the   butterfly, finishing behind Joseph Schooling of Singapore. The first track and field gold medal came with a world record: Almaz Ayana of Ethiopia shattered the mark for the women’s 10, 000 meters by more than 14 seconds. Our full Olympic coverage is here. _____ 4.   and   forces are pouring into Aleppo, Syria, intensifying a battle that has trapped hundreds of thousands of civilians with little or no electricity and dwindling supplies of food and water. A merchant in the city described long lines for gas, bare shelves at groceries and hospitals crammed with wounded soldiers, militiamen and residents. "Hopefully there will be an end to the Syrian civilians’ misery," a doctor said, "but we can’t see a light in the future. " _____ 5. Vladimir Putin surprised   by dismissing his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov, above left, a trusted aide for over four decades. His replacement, Anton Vaino, fits with a recent pattern of younger loyalists displacing an older generation of Mr. Putin’s peers. The Russian president "does not need advice, he needs people who will carry out his orders with as little fuss as possible," one analyst said. _____ 6. Fox News started rebuilding its leadership, naming two veteran executives as   three weeks after Roger Ailes was forced out over accusations of sexual harassment. One of them, Bill Shine, figured along with other executives in descriptions of a culture of intimidation given by women who accused Mr. Ailes of harassment. Both Mr. Ailes and Mr. Shine have denied any wrongdoing. Rupert Murdoch is expected to continue serving as chief executive until at least the presidential election in November. _____ 7. This is it for  . Alex Rodriguez, a player with a   roller coaster of a career, played his final game with the Yankees. His goodbye ceremony came right before a home game against the Tampa Bay Rays.

Four years after turning into a mocking meme, the work has helped turn its home, the small city of Borja, into a tourist mecca and even inspired a comic opera. The composer said he tried to reflect the tumult of the internet by drawing on "a Gregorian chant, a Spanish fandango, a Renaissance motet, a jota from Zaragoza, a classical chorus, an aria from the Zarzuela, a Flamenco tango, an   hook and a   bass line. " _____ 9. For your weekend: Here are some   options. On the small screen, Baz Luhrmann’s Netflix series "The Get Down" revels as only he can in the Bronx of the ’70s, the dawn of  . Our book critics’ recommendations include "  Stories of God," by Joy Williams, "a treasure trove of tiny wry masterpieces. " This   Magazine piece, "Fractured Lands: How the Arab World Came Apart," helps make sense of the Islamic State, the Arab Spring, Europe’s migration crisis and much more. And here are 20 recipes that involve little or no cooking, for those   days. _____ 10. Finally, the magnificent Perseids meteor shower will go on for days, but it’s lost on most of us because there’s too much light pollution. The former mining town of Westcliffe, Colo. above, and its neighbor, Silver Cliff, have been honored by a nonprofit working to stop light pollution as "  communities.
