Although presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump received two standing ovations from more than 200 House Republicans on Capitol Hill on Thursday morning, his second meeting of the day with Senate Republicans was more combative, according to the Washington Post. [The Post reports the meeting "grew combative as the presumptive presidential nominee admonished three senators who have been critical of his candidacy and predicted they would lose their reelection bids, according to two Republican officials with direct knowledge of the exchanges. "  Trump reportedly sparred with Sen. Jeff Flake ( ). Trump told Flake, "You’ve been very critical of me. " "Yes, I’m the other senator from Arizona  —   the one who didn’t get captured  —   and I want to talk to you about statements like that," Flake reportedly replied, referencing Trump’s statements last summer about Sen. John McCain ( ). The Post notes: Trump said at the meeting that he has yet to attack Flake hard but threatened to begin doing so. Flake stood up to Trump by urging him to stop attacking Mexicans. Trump predicted that Flake would lose his reelection, at which point Flake informed Trump that he was not on the ballot this year, the sources said. Trump allegedly also criticized Sen. Mark Kirk ( ) who withdrew his support for the billionaire after Trump made comments about the heritage of the Hispanic judge overseeing the Trump University case. The Post reports Sen. Ben Sasse ( ) was also singled out during the meeting. Sasse has been a very vocal critic of Trump. "Senator Sasse went to today’s meeting ready to listen. Senator Sasse introduced himself to Mr. Trump, and the two had a gracious exchange," stated Sasse’s spokesperson James Wegmann. "Mr. Sasse continues to believe that our country is in a bad place and, with these two candidates, this election remains a dumpster fire. Nothing has changed. "
