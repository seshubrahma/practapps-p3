Sen. Ted Cruz hit the campaign trail in both Pennsylvania and Indiana on Saturday bringing his campaign message to Pittsburgh, Plainfield and Indianapolis with a new joke based on Trump’s criticism of North Carolina’s new transgender bathroom law.

That is not a matter of right versus left or Democrat versus Republican. It’s a matter of common sense.
