Joining us live during tonight’s debate was Walter F. Mondale, the 42nd vice president of the United States: Mr. Mondale chatted with us via emails sent from his home in Minneapolis, sharing his thoughts. (Check out how we covered the debate in real time:  analysis, highlights and fact checks.) Mr. Mondale, a Democrat, is credited with reshaping the vice presidency under President Jimmy Carter: Where past running mates were routinely relegated to obscurity, Mr. Mondale became an influential partner in government. A supporter of Hillary Clinton, Mr. Mondale agreed to size up Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and weigh in on the role of the vice presidency. (We also invited former Vice President Dick Cheney to join us, but a spokesman said he was unavailable.) ____ ALEXANDER BURNS, 9:05 P. M. Eastern: Mr. Mondale began by laying out the major questions of the night, as he sees them. WALTER MONDALE, 9:05: I hope you will open up the issue of what kind of vice presidency they are planning. Do they have an understanding about what they will do? What authority will he have? Do they have a clear understanding with their principal, or is it up in the air? I’m doubtful that Pence has an understanding. This is very important. VPs can get lost. ____ BURNS, 9:06: What do you see as the major goals of a   candidate in this setting? MONDALE, 9:06: One of the first and central issues is what will the VP do when he disagrees with the pres. candidate. Big, silent question. ____ BURNS, 9:10: Is there a "right" answer to that question? Did you have an explicit understanding with Carter? MONDALE, 9:10: No, only degrees of discomfort. I told Carter that I would not disclose deep differences unless I told Carter. Did he believe me? ____ BURNS, 9:26: These were supposed to be the   candidates! Are you surprised to see them going at each other so aggressively like this? MONDALE, 9:26: Yes, I hope this can let up a little bit. ____ BURNS, 9:36: Are you hearing anything significant from these two about how they would approach the vice presidency? Is there anything we can take away from their attitudes in the debate so far? MONDALE, 9:36: I’d try to break in on what their plans are for their vice presidency and whether they have an understanding with their principal. ____ BURNS, 9:38: To follow up: It seems like Mike Pence isn’t showing any daylight with Donald Trump. Does that tell you anything about his approach to the role? He didn’t even give ground on taxes. MONDALE, 9:38: It says he is locked in with Trump. This would be a good night to spell out differences. He’s not doing it. ____ MONDALE, 9:49: Pence is filibustering, paying no attention to fairness in time allocation. I wish Kaine would hit Pence far harder for his behavior. ____ BURNS, 9:59: I remember in your debate with Bob Dole, he was seen as too mean because of his comment about "Democrat wars. " Does it ever amaze you that the tone of politics has gotten to this point? MONDALE, 9:59: Yes it does. ____ BURNS, 10:07: It kind of feels like we’re watching a debate between two pundits. What do you think voters need to know about a vice president, on a personal level, before that person comes into office? MONDALE, 10:07: What is the understanding, if any, about how the VP would serve the president? Do they have an agreement? Can the public be told? MONDALE, 10:07: I agree. We are not having the discussion that voters deserve. ____ BURNS, 10:15: It seems like we are getting a little more substance on foreign policy. Do you see Kaine as someone who can really advise Clinton in that area? He’s mostly talking about her record so far, not his own credentials. MONDALE, 10:15: I think the answer is yes. Kaine will be a big source of wisdom on policy and security issues. He’s on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees. ____ BURNS, 10:16: Seems like we just saw the first real difference between Trump and Pence. Pence called Putin a "small and bullying leader"  —   Trump has said the exact opposite. Can the president and vice president take two dramatically different views of a country like Russia? MONDALE, 10:16: I don’t get it. It must be explained and I don’t think he can. Pence is off on his own. ____ BURNS, 10:23: So how tired do you get up on that stage, this far into a debate? Is it exhausting, or do you just feel the adrenaline the whole time? MONDALE, 10:23: Adrenaline sustained me. I paid a price later. ____ BURNS, 10:25: What do you think of the way these two are talking about nuclear weapons? This was a major issue in your presidential campaign. It’s such an important subject, but we don’t talk about it nearly as much anymore. MONDALE, 10:25: Kaine won that debate. Pence had nothing to say about this issue. ____ BURNS, 10:45: You mentioned on the phone earlier that the question of faith in politics is important to you. Is this, at least, a place where we saw these two candidates as people? Did anything they said really stand out to you? MONDALE, 10:45: Yes. I thought that discussion was more positive. ____ BURNS, 10:48: That was a rough debate. Thank you so much for speaking with us. One last question: Did we learn anything we really needed to know? MONDALE, 10:48: Not much. MONDALE, 10:48: I’m astonished that not one question was asked about how they saw the elements of the vice presidency.
