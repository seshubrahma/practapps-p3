Yesenia Miranda, from Sacramento, told CNN, "He’s very ignorant. People in our city work hard for our money and for him just to do that was disrespectful. Not only did he perform two songs he was also an hour and a half late." Baylee Poole, a student at California State University, was also disappointed. "Kanye talked about how feelings mattered in his speech but when he left the stage, he left us in the Sacramento crowd confused and frustrated," she told CNN.  Dellan dela Cruz, who said he paid $107 for his ticket, said he was happy to be getting a refund but said, "The damage has already been done when it comes to how some people feel about Kanye now after this performance."
