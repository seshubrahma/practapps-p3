Saturday at CBS’s Republican presidential primary debate, former Gov. Jeb Bush ( ) countered his rival Donald Trump’s claim he was weak on immigration by saying, "It’s weak to disparage women. It’s weak to disparage Hispanics. It’s weak to denigrate the disabled. "  Partial transcript as follows: TRUMP: When I announced that I was running for president on June 16, illegal immigration wasn’t even a subject. If I didn’t bring it up, we wouldn’t even be talking. Now, I don’t often agree with Marco, and I don’t often agree with Ted, but I can in this case. The weakest person on this stage by far on illegal immigration is Jeb Bush. They come out of an act of love. Well whether you like it or not, he is so weak on illegal immigration, it’s laughable. and everybody knows it. BUSH: This is the standard operating procedure to disparage me. That’s fine. I don’t really care. TRUMP: Spend a little more money on the commercials. BUSH: But if you want to talk about weakness, you want to talk about weakness, it’s weak to disparage women. It’s weak to disparage Hispanics. It’s weak to denigrate the disabled. And it’s really weak to call John McCain a loser because he was a P. O. W. TRUMP: I never  …     BUSH: That is outrageous. He is an American hero. TRUMP: He also said —   excuse me. He said about language, two days ago, he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody, and that’s fine. Nobody reports that. He gets up and says that. And then he tells me oh, my language was a little bit rough. My language. BUSH: My mother is watching. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
