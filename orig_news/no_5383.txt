Wednesday during an Axios interview, veteran Washington Post reporter of Watergate fame Bob Woodward said the press has a "kind of smugness" about President Donald Trump.  When asked about press "smugness," Woodward said, "Yes. I think that is a giant problem. On television particularly, you will see a White House correspondent deliver a report and then say ‘the Trump White House said  …    ’ and then there’s a kind of smug smile, which is the correspondent undermining what the White House says. And there may be grounds for that, but it should be reported. It should be straight. " He added, "I think there are so many people that are treating the Trump presidency as if it’s a tryout —  as if it’s provisional. I was reading a column this morning that said Trump half won the presidency because he did not get the popular vote. He is president. Odds are he is probably going to be president for a full term, four years and maybe even more. There is hyperventilation. There is this kind of sense of too many people writing things like —  when is the impeachment coming, how long will it last, will he make it through the summer, and so forth. No, there may be stuff that comes out, but it has to be hard evidence. I worry for the business and I worry for the perception of the business by people, not to just Trump supporters, but people that see that kind of smugness that they are talking about. You know, he was elected, the Constitution says he gets a full term. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
