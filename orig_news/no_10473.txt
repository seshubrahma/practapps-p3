On "Fox News Sunday," Republican presidential   Donald Trump explained all of the things that were fair game if Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton made charges of sexism, most of which were about how Clinton handled her husband Bill Clinton’s indiscretions while she was first lady.  Trump said, "You’re talking about many. I mean, if you read the book, the book has other ones that were really horrible. You have one being  —   accusing him of rape, and other things. Hey, look, he was impeached. He lost his law license, couldn’t practice law. He had to pay a massive fine or a massive amount of money to  —   whether it’s Paula Jones, or whoever. And this was all done in the White House. A lot of this was done in the White House. Not a good situation.
