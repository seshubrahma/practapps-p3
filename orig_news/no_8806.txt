President Obama again tangled with a "Bill Clinton Is A Rapist" protester, after the man interrupted his rally in Cleveland, Ohio for Hillary Clinton. [Wearing a Bill Clinton shirt with the word "rapist" on the front, the man shouted "Bill Clinton is a rapist!" as Obama was speaking.  "Don’t be interrupting everybody. C’mon. C’mon sir," Obama said before leading a ‘Hillary Hillary Hillary!’ chant with the crowd of supporters. Obama admitted that he has noticed that the protest was going on "everywhere" and again told them to get their own rallies. "If you’re confident about the other guy, just go to his rallies," Obama said. He told the protester to go knock on doors for Trump, instead of interrupting his speech. "  …    unless you’re just being paid to be here," Obama added wryly. "In which case, hey, you know, everybody gotta to make a living. "
