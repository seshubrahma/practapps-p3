CNN’s editors selectively edited a video report about   pundit Van Jones ordering his GOP female colleague Kayleigh McEnany to "back off. "[The edit by CNN led viewers to believe that McEnany had incorrectly accused Jones of talking about interning Muslims.  In fact, the full video shows that Jones did make a false claim about newly elected President Donald J. Trump wanting to "intern" Muslims.  The skew in favor of Jones come as he uses his CNN perch to promote national protests against the Nov. 8 election result, for example, by describing the results as a white racist "whitelash.

"You need to have a little bit of empathy and understanding for people who are afraid because your candidate has been one of the most explosively provocative candidates in the history of our country.
