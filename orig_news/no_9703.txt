Former President Bill Clinton was asked Monday about his "past," following Donald Trump’s comments on Clinton’s long record of sexually harassing women. [Clinton was campaigning for his wife Hillary in New Hampshire, while Hillary spent the day in Iowa.  Clinton said that "Republicans have to decide" if his past experiences with women are fair game on the campaign trail. "I think there’s always attempts to take the election away from people," Clinton said, referring to his wife, whom he cheated on. Multiple women have accused Clinton of sexually harassing them, including Paula Jones, who sued Clinton for harassment, and Juanita Broaddrick, who claimed that Clinton raped her. Hillary Clinton is running a presidential campaign primarily focused on the fact that she is a woman.  OO. ready( function()  ) })
