New York  (CNN) Priorities USA, a   Clinton super PAC, raised more than $12 million in May, the group announced Monday, a number that is significantly higher than the organization brought in a month before. The super PAC, which is now tasked with defining Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, starts the month with $52 million in   . The increased haul comes as Clinton turns her focus to Trump and away from Democratic rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. It also comes as Trump’s campaign has struggled to turn its focus to the general and is mired in a string of negative stories, including the firing of his campaign manager on Monday.  The biggest donor in May was Fred Eychaner, a   media mogul. He donated $3 million to the organization. The haul puts Priorities in a place to continue to run   ads throughout the general election campaign. To date, Priorities has reserved close to $150 million in television, radio, and digital ads. Trump’s campaign and affiliated super PACs, by comparison, have currently reserved no ad times between now and November, according to Kantar  .   "In the last few weeks Donald Trump accused President (Barack) Obama of working with ISIS, took a victory lap following a national tragedy and mimed shooting someone at one of his events," Guy Cecil, the group’s chief strategist, said Monday. "We will not let up in our efforts to defeat him this November, and are grateful for our continued fundraising success." So far the campaign has released a handful of ads that paint Trump has a candidate   for the presidency who is "far too dangerous to ever be President of the United States." The group’s first ads, released late last month, used Trump’s own comments to cast the presumptive Republican nominee as  . To date, Priorities has reserved ad time in North Carolina, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire and Virginia.
