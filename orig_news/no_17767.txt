’  ’ ’   It is sometimes difficult to get a detailed, direct answer from   President Trump and his surrogates on their economic policy.   During the campaign he slid past substance by making sweeping   claims of how, under a Trump administration, the U. S. would ’’"win   bigly" and "stop being taken advantage of." ’ ’   Those pronouncements continue. ’ "   But luckily, there is one voice coming from the White House that   clearly articulates the direction in which it wants this country   to head economically. That voice belongs to Peter Navarro, the   head of Trump’s newly formed  " "   Over the last few weeks, Navarro has given a number of interviews   that explain the administration’s propensity for victimhood, an   obsession with Germany, and a   desire to change the   face of the American economy as we know it.
