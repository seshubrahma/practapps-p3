Pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday, discussing the state of the presidential race, as well as the looming United Nations’ "Internet takeover" being discussed in Congress, as Breitbart News reported. [Breitbart News highlighted:  Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has sided with the sovereignty of the American people against international elites yet again by coming out in public opposition to President Barack Obama’s internet giveaway to a United Nations globalist body. Caddell said, "We polled on this weeks ago, and it is overwhelming. The people who knew about it were against it because they mean it is another sign of America selling out. I just do not understand the stupidity of Republicans, frankly. " "They do not understand the issues that they have that we are showing in our polling, like on Iran  —   that they’re cheating, or already cheating. Why this is not like the Internet  —   a giveaway, going at Obama on those things," he pondered, before adding: These are major questions. Voters should be animated, and it is just frustrating beyond belief to me that it has not come  up yet, and they, apparently, the leadership of the Republican Party, caved in on that, again. But the Democrats want to do that. Why aren’t the Republicans making that an issue? Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. EST. LISTEN:
