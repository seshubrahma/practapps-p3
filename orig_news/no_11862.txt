Liberal superstar Sen. Elizabeth Warren channeled pop mega star Taylor Swift during her commencement speech  —   and even tried to sing some of her famous lyrics. [During her speech at Bridgewater State University last weekend, Warren encouraged graduates to "fight" despite obstacles that appeared in their paths.  "As one of the great philosophers of our time has said, ‘Haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate,’" she said, chanting the lyrics. "Knowing who you are helps shake it off. " "O. K.," she admitted after attempting to sing. "I promised I wouldn’t sing, and I definitely can not dance like Britney Spears. " She referred to her own graduation ceremony, acknowledging that she would have never imagined the things she might do as a U. S. senator. "I never imagined I would get into a Twitter war with Donald Trump," she said earning wild applause from the class of graduates and faculty members. "But here I am living the life. " Warren cited her own biography to inspire graduates, detailing the struggles of marrying early and trying to pursue an education and law career while giving birth to two children. "I gotta tell you, Washington is filled with people who say ‘No it can’t be done, never never never,’" she said. "And these days they say it in nastier and nastier ways. "
