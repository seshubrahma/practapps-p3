Friday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh argued there was a "silent coup" underway against President Donald Trump.  Limbaugh accused former President Barack Obama of putting it in place before leaving office and said that it is currently being executed. He pointed to the   controversy of Attorney General Jeff Sessions associations with the Russian government and U. S. Senate Democrats   Trump’s cabinet appointees. "I’m not taking anything away from what I said yesterday," he said. "I’m adding to it. We’re watching a silent coup that was put in place by Obama and the Democrats during the transition and before and after the election. " "I think what is happening here is a   effort here to deny Trump the actual control of governing and the government by leaving so many Obama career people appointed, by going so slowly on confirming Trump’s cabinet appointees and other lesser bureaucratic position that remain open and haven’t been filled," Limbaugh said later in the segment. "And that’s why it appears the Democrats are still running the show. " Limbaugh went to add if you wanted to know the real saboteurs are, then look for a link between Obama and the Russian government. "I’m telling you  —   if you want to find out who is really working together to sabotage the United States, you find the link between Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, and the Russian government. That’s the story. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
