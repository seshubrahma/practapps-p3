’  ’ "   Former FBI Director James Comey is expected to testify in a   public appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee next   week that President Donald Trump pressured him to end the   bureau’s investigation into Michael Flynn, the former national   security adviser, according to multiple reports. " "   Comey has been cleared to testify by the Justice Department’s   special counsel, Robert Mueller, according to NBC News. After   Trump fired Comey earlier this month, Deputy Attorney General Rod   Rosenstein appointed Mueller to lead the criminal investigation   into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow during the   2016 election.
