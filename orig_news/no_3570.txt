Filmmaker Spike Lee posted a photo to Instagram of himself holding up a pair of custom Black History Month Air Jordan 1s, in an apparent show of protest against President Donald Trump. [One shoe featured the   slogan "RESIST" while the other shoe read "REPEL AGENT ORANGE," a moniker popularized by rapper Busta Rhymes, who referred to Trump as "President Agent Orange" during a performance at the 59th annual Grammy Awards this month.  "RESIST  —   REPEL AGENT ORANGE. DATS DA PUTIN TRUTH, RUTH.  ?  . BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY," Lee wrote in the caption below the photo. "Shout Out To My Man Busta Rhymes.
