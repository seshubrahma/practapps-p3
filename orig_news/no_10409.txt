Monday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," host Joe Scarborough warned the media that by calling   Donald Trump a Nazi they "set the bar so low he’ll win again. "  Scarborough said, "Hysterical and making the same mistake that people have now made twice about Donald Trump. He cannot win the primary, and they give him 1 percent chance. And so what do they do? I’m sorry. I got to say it. I said this from the beginning. Ronald Reagan feasted on the low expectations of his rivals. There were piles of political bones at Ronald Reagan’s feet from people who underestimated him. They did it to Donald Trump during the primary. They did it to Donald Trump during the general election. They should have learned their lesson. Nobody in the media learned their lesson. Nobody. They’re doing it again. You paint a swastika on his forehead, you call him a Nazi, you’re going to set expectations so low that he’s going to beat you again. It’s just going to happen.
