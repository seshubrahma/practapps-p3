Sunday, on ABC’s "This Week With George Stephanopoulos," former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, advisor to presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, and a potential VP for Trump, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn corrected guest host Martha Raddatz for referring to illegal immigrants as undocumented.  Partial transcript as follows: RADDATZ: Let’s talk about immigration. Let me ask you, immigration, should all undocumented immigrants be deported? FLYNN: So, undocumented or illegal? RADDATZ: Undocumented, illegal. FLYNN: OK. So, if you’re  —   if it’s illegal, it’s illegal. So  …     RADDATZ: Undocumented? FLYNN: Are they here illegally? I mean, if they’re here illegally, then it’s illegal. I mean, again, back to my very first point, the rule of law in this country is probably the single biggest strategic advantage that we have, above and beyond all other countries in the world. And we cannot allow the rule of law to break down. (  Mediaite) Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
