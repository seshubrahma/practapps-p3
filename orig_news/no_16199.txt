Washington (CNN) Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Tuesday he thinks the controversy surrounding Melania Trump’s apparent plagiarism of Michelle Obama’s speech ultimately won’t matter to the "vast majority of Americans." "I get why it’s a big deal in terms of the internal, inside baseball of political coverage," Rubio told CNN’s Jake Tapper on "The Lead." "But I think for the vast majority of Americans, it doesn’t really matter one way or the other." The Florida senator added that Melania Trump "is not a politician." "This is new to her," he told Tapper. "She did a very good job in a difficult circumstance." Rubio said that as long as Trump’s speech reflected how she feels, then "that’s what really matters." No one to be fired after Melania Trump speech plagiarism episode, When Tapper pressed Rubio on whether he would be upset if his children plagiarized a term paper in school, Rubio replied: "I would, but that’s different." The former presidential hopeful said that plagiarism on a term paper would be intentional    but that he doubted Trump’s speech was intentionally lifted from Michelle  Obama’s 2008 convention speech.  Rubio added that he imagined Trump had discussed her background with speechwriters and then had a member of the campaign help her put the address together    and he said he’s "sure the Trump campaign is going to be talking to whoever that is."
