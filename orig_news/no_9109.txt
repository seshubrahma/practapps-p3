EAU CLAIRE, Wisconsin  —   Donald Trump has been drawing large, capacity crowds at his rallies across the country over the past week, dwarfing  —   by far  —   most of the crowds at Hillary Clinton events. [But the evidence from new voter registration and early voting leans somewhat in Clinton’s favor, overall.  That raises the question: do Trump’s crowds mean anything  —   and if so, what?

Nowhere was that more true than in the Democratic primary in California. Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) drew massive audiences all across the Golden State, filing stadiums and leaving many thousands outside. The polls were also close, showing Sanders catching up to Clinton even reaching a dead heat in some instances. But in the end, Clinton   the polls, trouncing Sanders soundly  —   by  .

Pollak (@joelpollak) October 30, 2016,  The fact is that Hillary Clinton has had years  —   decades, even  —   to build an organization, and has a ground game that Donald Trump could not hope to match even if he had tried. So while Sanders was wowing the crowds  —   and the media  —   with his big rallies, Clinton was quietly making sure voters showed up at the polls or mailed in their ballots. That quiet, disciplined work paid off handsomely. Trump has several advantages that Sanders does not. For one thing, Sanders relied heavily on younger voters, who are among the least likely to vote in the end.

That could very well be the case  —   but it is impossible, by definition, to say with any degree of certainty. Panoramic shot of crowd before #GrandRapids #Michigan #Trump rally.

All we know is that they are evidence that he has an energized core of fans. They may be more energized now, after the FBI   its investigation into Clinton’s email server, and after Clinton was caught cheating in the primary debates, and so on. Yet many of the people at Trump’s rallies are   supporters. It is likely that a large rally does have some effect on voters in the surrounding area  —   otherwise, Clinton herself would not bother doing them  —   but Clinton’s " " has turned some of that effect negative. (Even today, after the success of James O’Keefe and Project Veritas in exposing the truth, many  —   perhaps most  —   Democrats still think Donald Trump incited violence at his rallies, and view his events with horror.)

There is some evidence to suggest that is a real risk. After the email scandal flared anew, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta wrote an email to Clinton supporters, telling them to buck up (and asking for money). "Here’s what this changes for you and this campaign: Absolutely nothing," he wrote. If Podesta really is worried, Trump’s crowds have more reason to cheer. Joel B.
