Chris Wallace suggested Sunday that Donald Trump is trolling Sen. Ted Cruz about his birth in Canada to an American mother, but Trump hit back, hard. ["I didn’t raise it, The Washington Post raised it.  They asked me a question, I said, ‘I really don’t know,’" Trump declared, before saying:  The Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit.  If it’s Ted [Cruz who wins the nomination] the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit.  He’s got to have this thing worked out  …     nobody knows what it means.  And, it hasn’t been adjudicated, and it hasn’t gone to the Supreme Court. And I’m only saying this  —   and I speak well of Ted.  I’m only saying that Ted has to get this problem solved because if he’s running against a Democrat, and they bring a lawsuit, he’s got a hell of a thing over his head  …     what I told Ted to do is go into court for declaratory judgment. Wallace, the host of Fox News Sunday, tried a second time to make his trolling charge stick. WALLACE:    …     But people say you’re trolling him. TRUMP:  I’m not trolling. WALLACE:  And you’re under the guise of helping him, you’re sticking in the knife. TRUMP:  No, I’m not.  What he should do is ask for declaratory judgment because, you know what? WALLACE:  But he says it’s not an issue, and in fact when you raised it, he posted a video of the Fonz jumping the shark, and  —   TRUMP:  OK, look  —   WALLACE:  He’s kind of laughing at this. TRUMP:  Chris, he’s not laughing, he’s taking it very seriously.  He should take it very seriously, and I don’t want  —   you know what?  I think I’m going to win.  I don’t want to beat him in this way. Cruz’s campaign provided Breitbart News with a copy of his   for a Jan. 8 article. His mother, Eleanor Darragh, was born in Delaware on Nov. 23, 1934, establishing her citizenship by birth —  and, according to U. S. law, that of her son, even though he was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, on Dec. 22, 1970.
