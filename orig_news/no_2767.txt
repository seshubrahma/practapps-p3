(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. We’ll be off on Monday. Your Evening Briefing will resume publishing on Tuesday. Here’s the latest. 1. Anis Amri, the chief suspect in the Berlin Christmas market attack, was killed by the police outside Milan, ending a manhunt across Europe. Mr. Amri was stopped by the police outside a train station around 3 a. m. local time. He quickly pulled out a pistol and shot one officer. He was shot and killed by another officer. Hours later, the Islamic State released a video featuring Mr. Amri in which he declares he was avenging coalition airstrikes that have killed civilians in Syria. Investigators were trying to determine if Mr. Amri had been working with anyone else, and how he managed to flee Germany. _____ 2. "Let it be an arms race. " That’s what   Donald Trump said in a phone call with an MSNBC host who asked about his recent comments on Twitter on nuclear weapons. "We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all," Mr. Trump said. We attempted to translate and explain his tweet on this subject. Mr. Trump also released a letter from Vladimir Putin in which the Russian president said he hoped to "bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level. " Mr. Trump called it "a very nice letter. " In his annual marathon news conference in Moscow, Mr. Putin said Russia was not seeking a new arms race, but is looking to improve its armaments so that they could pierce other nations’ missile defenses. _____ 3. The United States abstained in a U. N. vote against Israel’s settlement policy, defying calls to veto from Israel and Mr. Trump. That broke a longstanding American tradition of serving as Israel’s sturdiest diplomatic shield. The   Security Council voted   in favor of the measure, which states that construction and expansion of Israeli settlements imperil the viability of a   solution. _____ 4. All 109 passengers and crew members on board a hijacked Libyan airliner were released, hours after two men claiming to be carrying explosives forced the plane to divert to Malta. The hijackers were apparently members of a group that supported Col. Muammar   and were seeking asylum in Europe. The flight was operated by the   Afriqiyah Airways. _____  5. We visited the historically Christian villages and towns around Mosul, Iraq. They were among the first places to be liberated from the Islamic State earlier this year. Many residents remain fearful about their future there, but some say the experience strengthened their faith. "They can destroy our houses, our things, but not our souls," one nun said. _____ 6. An experimental vaccine has been shown to provide 100 percent protection against one of the most common forms of Ebola. The findings were published in a medical journal this week. The vaccine has not yet been approved for use. "It’s certainly good news with regard to any new outbreak  —   and one will occur somewhere," a top scientist said. "But we still need to continue working on Ebola vaccines. " _____ 7. Here in the U. S. immunotherapy has become the hottest area in cancer research and treatment. But the clinical trials are overwhelmingly white, and researchers are seeking a more diverse patient pool. _____ 8. Pope Francis is elevating a new crop of leaders to realign the Roman Catholic Church with his priorities. Among them is Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin, the    incoming archbishop of Newark, N. J. He’s an amiable guy from a   neighborhood in Detroit who has ministered to the poor, AIDS patients and   inmates. Here’s the story of his journey to the pinnacle of the global church. _____ 9. Among our   articles today is this confirmation that human connection lies at the heart of our  . Research has found loneliness is as important a risk factor for early death as obesity and smoking. Older people are particularly vulnerable. But new programs are coming up with creative ways to encourage   community. _____ 10. Finally, one of our nation’s   diplomats has gone viral. Caroline Kennedy is closely followed in Japan, where she has been posted since 2013. For Christmas, she dressed as Santa for a video that features embassy staff mimicking dance moves from a popular Japanese TV series. Nearly 4 million people have watched it on YouTube. "We thought people would enjoy it," an embassy spokesman said. "But we had no idea how popular it would become. " Happy holidays! _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
