Of course, Silverman’s followers were quick to point out that the markings were, in fact, innocuous markings used in construction, often to designate a spot for which there is a pipe or a wire underneath. Others simply ridiculed the comedian for her post, attributing other innocent, everyday situations to the work of nefarious extremists. . @SarahKSilverman Check it out.
