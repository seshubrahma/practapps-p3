Monday in Youngstown, OH, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump proposed "extreme vetting" of immigrants.  Trump said, "A Trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration. And we will be tough. We will be even extreme. We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. That time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme, extreme vetting. Our country has enough problems. We donâ€™t need more. These are problems like we have never had before. In addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers of terrorist groups we must also screen out any who have hostile attitude towards our country or its principles, or who believed Sharia law should supplant American law. Those who did not believe in our constitution or the support bigotry and hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country.  Only those who we expect to flourish in our country and to embrace a tolerant American society should be issued visas. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
