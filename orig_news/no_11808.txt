Wednesday in New York City, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump criticized Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, saying her undisclosed foreign donations while at the State Department means she is the "most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States. "  Trump said, "In the words of the Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office, somebody that saw her a lot and knows her probably better than almost anybody, she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office. From the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true. Her leadership style —  volcanic impulsive, disdainful and disdainful of the rules set for everyone else —  hasn’t changed one bit. Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by radical Islam. In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that’s an increase over president Obama’s already high number. Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on earth, with no way to screen who they are, what they are, what they believe, where they come from. Already hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the United States. The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive   and   regimes on earth. I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people. He added, "Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1, 000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department. Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
