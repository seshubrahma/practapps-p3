Thursday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends," conservative commentator Mark Steyn offered his views on how President Donald Trump should proceed with the Paris Accord on   climate change.    Brian Kilmeade asked why the issue of climate change had become a "religion" for the left, to which Steyn noted those on the left argue border enforcement is an impossibility, yet they believe they can control the heavens. "I think precisely because it is so meaningless," Steyn replied as to why the left is so invested in the issue. "Because if you say to them, ‘Let’s enforce the border’  —   ‘What? Are you out of your mind? That’s just a natural phenomenon. We can’t enforce the border. People are going to be coming in anyway.’ But if you say to them, ‘We can control the very heavens,’ that, we can do. And it’s actually literally insane. The less it has to do with your life, the more the left is invested in it. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
