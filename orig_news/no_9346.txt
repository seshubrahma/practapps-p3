Utah Sen Mike Lee says: "I have not supported Donald Trump up to this point, I have not endorsed him. I have some concerns with him. He scares me to death so does Hillary Clinton. There is no easy choice right now. "[Lee made the remarks during a telephone town hall with constituents.  Added Lee, "I’m going to continue to watch this. I’ll make the decision as best I can, but I’m not there yet," according to reports. Lee backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in this year’s contentious Republican primary. He did not, however, rule out backing presumptive nominee Trump at some point in the future.
