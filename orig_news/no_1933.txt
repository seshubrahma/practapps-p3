A handwritten poem scrawled by Anne Frank in a friend’s notebook is up for sale in the Netherlands today. Bubb Kuyper Auctions, based in Haarlem, expects to sell the rare item for between 30, 000 and 50, 000 euros. Anne penned the short poem in a notebook belonging to her friend Jacqueline van Maarsen’s older sister, Christiane. The work is dated March 1942, just a few months before Anne and her family went into hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam. All but her father eventually died in the Holocaust. Only a few of her writings aside from the diary she kept while in hiding have emerged. This spring, a Massachusetts museum bought a copy of Grimm’s fairy tales in which she had inscribed her and her sister’s names. In 1989, another short piece of verse written in a friend’s notebook went on sale at Christie’s. The poem’s opening features traditional lines of encouragement, and can be traced to a 1930s Dutch periodical. The closing verses, which the auction house has not traced, may be Anne’s own. "If others have reproached   what you have done wrong," the poem ends, "Then be sure to amend your   is the best answer one can make. " Christopher D.
