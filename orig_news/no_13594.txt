The Washington Post published an editorial on Thursday calling for the Republican Party to reject the will of its primary voters and to stage a brokered convention to prevent Donald Trump from becoming its presidential nominee. [The editorial argues that Trump is a dangerous demagogue who must be stopped by and legal means necessary:  DONALD TRUMP’S primary victories Tuesday present the Republican Party with a stark choice. Should leaders unite behind Mr. Trump, who has collected the most delegates but may reach the convention in July without a nominating majority? Or should they do everything they can to deny him the nomination? On a political level, this may be a dilemma. As a moral question, it is straightforward. The mission of any responsible Republican should be to block a Trump nomination and election.   …     Mr. Trump must be stopped because he presents a threat to American democracy. Mr. Trump resembles other strongmen throughout history who have achieved power by manipulating democratic processes   …     We are not advocating that rules be broken, but that they be employed to maximum effect  —   to force a brokered convention and nominate a conservative candidate who respects the Constitution, or to defeat Mr. Trump in some other way.
