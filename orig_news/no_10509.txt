"@realDonaldTrump could be a national @ToddAkin," Rep. @DarrellIssa tells @ChrisCuomo https:  .  Tuesday on CNN’s "New Day," Rep. Darrell Issa warned that Donald Trump could be a repeat of former Rep. Todd Akin ( ) who ran for U. S. Senate in 2012 but lost after making a controversial statement about abortion in the cases of rape.  Issa told host Chris Cuomo that if the GOP doesn’t unite behind one candidate, Trump could pose the same threat to the GOP’s chances in the 2016 election cycle as Akin did in 2012. "Probably the most ridiculing candidacy that we’ve had and it was in 2012 was Todd Akin running for senator," Issa said. "And he managed not to just bring down the Missouri race, but bring down a number of others. That’s not questionable or deniable. He got 36 percent in the primary over the state treasurer who go 30 [percent] and another candidate who got  . It was close. He was the wrong candidate and it wasn’t until later that they realized that somebody who wasn’t think about what they said, who was saying things that were off the wall brought down the party. Donald Trump could be a national Todd Akin if our party doesn’t coalesce behind a single candidate. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
