When you go through the full   to that tweet, there was a reporting purpose for that tweet going out, which is, more than you’re going to want to hear about. I thought, I was making fun of Fox News and the rest who were doing, Hillary has seizures. Hillary has multiple sclerosis. Hillary has Parkinson’s. You know, Let’s go to Dr. Oz. And so I was running a series of jokes leading up to that, with the intent of sending that tweet, which was a signal to a source to talk to me.
