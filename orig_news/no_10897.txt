Presumptive Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign is turning toward the general election, launching a website that targets frustrated Republican voters who don’t support presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. ["The website, republicansagainsttrump. org, was registered on May 27 and launched on June 2, according to domain registration records," Politico reports. "The Clinton campaign only appears to have begun buying ads to promote the site more recently. "  If supporters pledge to oppose Trump in the fall, they get a free "Republicans Against Trump" sticker. "Donald Trump is not qualified to be president. He does not represent my beliefs as a Republican and, more importantly, my values as an American. He does not speak for me and I will not vote for him," the pledge states. According to text on the website, it was "Paid for by Hillary for America. " "The Clinton campaign has purchased ads promoting the site on Facebook, where a ‘Republicans Against Trump’ page had 450 ‘likes’ as of 11:30pm on Tuesday," Politico notes.
