’  ’ "   President Donald Trump repeated a debunked claim about the US   murder rate on Tuesday, incorrectly telling a group of sheriffs   that the country’s murder rate was at its highest point in 47   years. " ’   "The murder rate in our country is the highest it’’s been in 47   years, right?" Trump said at a White House meeting with members   of the National Sheriffs Association, . "Did you know that?     years. I used to use that  —   I’’d say that in a speech   and everybody was surprised. Because the press doesn’’t tell it   like it is. It wasn’’t to their advantage to say that." ’ ’   "But the murder rate is the highest it’’s been in, I guess, from   45 to 47 years." ’ " show that the US murder rate in 2015  —   the   most recent year with available statistics  —   was 4. 9 per 100, 000   people. That’s one of the lowest rates ever. The murder rate was   that year less than half of the nation’s peak rate of 10. 2 in   1980, or its   year, 1991, when the rate was 9. 8. " ’   The 2015 murder rate was also notably lower than it was between   1996 and 2009, when it descended from 7. 4 to 5. 0. ’ ’’ ’   Now, the 2015 figure did mark a slight uptick from the year   before, jumping from a   4. 4 to 4. 9. That marked an   increase of about 11% and was the highest   increase of   the murder rate in 50 years. But the murder rate was still   considerably lower than in previous decades. ’ "   As some reporters have  Trump may be confusing that   increase with the   actual murder rate  —   but they’re not the same thing. " ’   Trump frequently misstated the murder rate as a candidate on the   campaign trail, and has repeated the falsehood since winning the   election in November. ’ ’President Donald Trump repeated a debunked. ..’
