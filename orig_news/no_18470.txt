’  ’ ’   President Donald Trump channeled emotions from the bitter 2016 US   presidential election by taking a shot at his former rival on   Twitter. ’ ’   "Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself,   refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook &   even Dems & DNC," Trump  on   Wednesday evening. ’ ’   The tweet follows the comments Clinton made at Recode’’s Code   Conference in Los Angeles earlier in the day. At the conference,   Clinton ripped the Democratic Party’’s "bankrupt" operation that   she acquired after winning the party’’s nomination. ’ ’   "I get the nomination," said Clinton. "So I’’m now the nominee of   the Democratic Party. I inherit nothing from the Democratic   Party. I mean it was bankrupt. It was on the verge of insolvency.   Its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong. I had to   inject money into it." ’ ’   Clinton also  that Trump   was given a "tried and true effective" data operation from the   GOP, which took advantage of Facebook users, once he won his   party’’s nomination. ’ ’   Nearly an hour after Trump sent out his initial tweet criticizing   Clinton’’s remarks, Clinton  with a   reference to a misspelled word Trump tweeted the night before  —     one that has since : "People in covfefe houses shouldn’’t throw covfefe." ’ ’President Donald Trump channeled emotions from. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
