’  ’ ’   A Trump Organization staffer who helped Melania Trump craft her   primetime speech before the Republican National Convention   offered an apology Wednesday after the prepared remarks were   found to contain plagiarism. ’ ’   "This was my mistake, and I feel terrible for the chaos I have   caused Melania and the Trumps, as well as to Mrs. Obama," Trump   staff writer Meredith McIver said in a note. "No harm was meant." ’ ’   "I apologize for the confusion and hysteria my mistake has   caused," she added. ’ ’   The comments came two days after Melania Trump delivered her   speech at the RNC in which she  from first lady Michelle Obama’s   2008 Democratic National Convention address. ’ ’   McIver said that while working with Melania Trump the two   "discussed many people who inspired her." ’ ’   "A person she has always liked is Michelle Obama," McIver said.   "Over the phone, she read me some passages from Mrs. Obama’’s   speech as examples. I wrote them down and later included some of   the phrasing in the draft that ultimately became the final   speech.
