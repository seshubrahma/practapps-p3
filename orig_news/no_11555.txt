They would be calling for my execution," Trump said. "It would be a whole different ballgame if I said it, believe me.

" "Voter ID, what’s with that?" Trump questioned. "Why aren’t we having voter ID? In other words, I want to vote, here’s my identification  …    as opposed to somebody coming up and voting 15 times for Hillary. " The crowd booed in response. "I will not tell you to vote 15 times," Trump added, saying voter ID is a "very important thing. " In addition to Tuesday’s afternoon rally in Wilmington, Trump is also holding an evening campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
