Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told a room full of supporters Friday that if he were president, he "will do more for the   people in one year than Barack Obama has done in his seven year, soon to be eight years. "["If I were   I would be so angry at him," Trump added.  The Republican frontrunner brought up Obama’s record on black unemployment, which the real estate mogul says has soared under the first black president’s watch. "  youth has an almost 60 percent unemployment rate," Trump said. "  people that are 25,   age, 25 to 40, have such a high unemployment rate, you wouldn’t believe it. It’s gone up and it’s gotten worse since he’s been president. " Indeed, by nearly every economic measurement, black people are far worse off since President Obama took office. There are more black Americans living in poverty today —  10. 8 million at 26. 2 percent —  than there were in 2009 (25. 8 percent) when President Obama took office. A jarring 26. 4 percent of black households receive food stamps assistance, despite black Americans being just 13 percent of the total population. Black children under the age 18 made up 27 percent of the black population in 2014 but are 38 percent of blacks in poverty. The black jobless rate is currently 9. 1 percent, nearly double the national average. "If I were   I wouldn’t like him very much. I will do more for the   people than Barack Obama has ever done," Trump said Friday. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
