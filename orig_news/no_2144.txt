(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Vladimir Putin of Russia said he would not retaliate against the United States for its decision to expel Russian diplomats and impose new sanctions. President Obama announced those actions on Thursday as punishment for Russian hacking operations aimed at influencing the American presidential election. Mr. Putin is apparently betting on improved relations with   Donald Trump. Above, the U. S. Embassy in Moscow. _____ 2. The take from our Washington bureau, in fact, is that Mr. Putin may have handed Mr. Trump a lifeline. Mr. Trump can now start a new chapter on a range of areas in which the two countries are at odds, including Syria, Ukraine, Crimea, the Middle East, the future of NATO and nuclear weapons. But moving too far, or too fast, in that direction creates enormous risks for Mr. Trump. Members of the Republican Party establishment remain strongly suspicious of Mr. Putin’s intentions. _____ 3. A   between the Syrian government and rebel groups tentatively took hold, with scattered reports of clashes, shelling and airstrikes. The truce, brokered by Russia and Turkey, was announced a day earlier and excludes the Islamic State and Al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate. Russia said seven opposition groups had signed the agreement, which calls for peace talks in Kazakhstan next month. The largest group of rebel fighters denied doing so. _____ 4. Next door in Iraq, our photographer spent three weeks with the security forces who are battling to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State militants. He found no continuous front line, but a patchwork of battlegrounds in the city and all around its edge. When the terror group retreats from a position, it tries to leave as much damage behind as possible, including burning oil fields and snipers. And it doesn’t go far: the threat remains that it could return and reclaim the territory. _____ 5. Fish along the Atlantic Coast are moving north, seeking cooler waters as ocean temperatures rise. Lobster, once a staple in southern New England, have decamped to Maine. Black sea bass, mackerel, and herring, to name just a few, have shifted their routes. But fishing regulations have failed to keep up with these geographical changes. _____ 6. As revelers stream into Times Square to see the New Year’s ball drop, there will be a new addition to the security infrastructure:   garbage trucks loaded with sand and parked in strategic spots. The police said there are no specific threats to the event, but the trucks serve as a deterrent to truck attacks like those that have struck Nice and Berlin. _____ 7. China announced that it was banning commerce in ivory by the end of 2017. The country is the world’s largest ivory market and the move could deal a blow to the practice of elephant poaching in Africa. It comes after years of international pressure to stop the practice from wildlife protection advocates. Above, ivory is burned in Cameroon. _____ 8. The wildest snowboarding scene in the U. S. is in an pretty unlikely location:   Rhode Island. Snowboarders there use the natural terrain as well as the unnatural (buildings, snowcats, pipes) to construct landscapes with one I’     feature after another. Then they shoot video of their runs and let the snowboarding world watch in awe. _____ 9. Tech companies are trying something new: pursuing women to join their boards. Silicon Valley companies are facing growing pressure to diversify. Boards are seen as particularly important because they are power centers that can spur broader changes. _____ 10. This year, our photographers captured subjects of all kinds: famous and   athletic and political, human and canine. Here are our favorite shots from their assignments. _____ 11. In commemoration of Carrie Fisher, we asked readers to share what she and Princess Leia meant to them. Generations of female "Star Wars" fans have dressed as Princess Leia for Halloween, or used her as inspiration for their own lives. "Leia was the only princess I ever wanted to be," one woman wrote. _____ 12. Finally, a look at the science of champagne bubbles. Once the cork pops, a sudden change in pressure releases carbon dioxide trapped in the bottle. Bubbles cling to the edges of your glass, rising to the top before they hit the air and burst. The explosion creates tiny droplets of liquid that crash against your tongue like shooting stars. Some advice: For a bubblier glass, allow your bottle to warm up a bit after you take it out of the refrigerator. And if you go overboard, take a pain reliever and hydrate to mitigate a hangover. Happy New Year! _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
