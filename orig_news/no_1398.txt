(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Democrats seemed relieved and pleased a day after Hillary Clinton used a major speech to ridicule Donald J. Trump. Some Republicans fretted that Mr. Trump might not be up to the task of repelling such attacks. "I thought it was one of the most important speeches Secretary Clinton has made throughout this campaign," said Leon Panetta, the former defense secretary under President Obama and chief of staff for Bill Clinton. _____ 2. The judge hearing a   lawsuit by former students of Trump University is a cool customer, his friends say. That temperament is said to be helping the judge, Gonzalo Curiel, weather unusual public criticism by Mr. Trump. His attacks on Judge Curiel, including calling out his Mexican heritage, are part of a pattern of behavior that has led some scholars to question Mr. Trump’s respect for the rule of law. _____ 3. Officials in Chicago released videos and other materials from 101 cases in which police officers had shot or otherwise injured civilians. The officials said many of the videos were not illuminating, but the disclosure was unusual for a city whose police department has a reputation for secrecy. The head of the investigative agency behind the release said it represented "an important step" toward increased transparency. _____ 4. As flooding in Paris threatened the Louvre, staff members and volunteers worked to remove  art from harm’s way. Nearly 160, 000 works were moved to higher floors from storage areas and galleries. Rain has lifted the Seine River to its highest levels since 1982. _____ 5. The U. S. economic recovery isn’t quite as robust as analysts had hoped: Employers added just 38, 000 workers in May, the lowest monthly growth since September 2010. But the numbers aren’t as foreboding as they seem, our analyst writes. Averaging job growth over the past three months shows a more modest slowdown. _____ 6. Nest, a digital device maker  Google bought for $3. 2 billion in 2014, drew comparisons to Apple with its innovative approach to bringing unglamorous household devices like thermostats into sync with a digital world. Its   Tony Fadell said Friday that he was leaving because Nest was in "maintenance mode. " But the departure came after reports that Nest had a harsh corporate culture and Mr. Fadell an abrasive style. _____ 7. It’s a big weekend in sports, kicking off tonight at 9:30 Eastern time with the first game of the Copa América soccer tournament, pitting the United States against Colombia. On Saturday, Serena Williams goes for her 22nd major championship in the French Open final, and the Pittsburgh Penguins shoot for a   lead over the San Jose Sharks in the Stanley Cup finals. Sunday brings Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray competing in the French Open final, while the Cleveland Cavaliers, down   to the Golden State Warriors in the N. B. A. finals, try to tie the series. _____ 8. If you’re looking for a movie to watch this weekend, our critics say the mockumentary "Popstar: Never Stop Stopping" is one of your best bets. It features Andy Samberg as a Justin   pop idol, and "takes aim at everything that is artificial and plastic in contemporary pop in a spirit of love rather than spite," A. O. Scott writes. Ostensibly more serious fare: "Me Before You" is the story of a romance between a paralyzed aristocrat and the woman hired to keep him company. But Mr. Scott finds it to be ridiculous. _____ 9. Most West African capitals are scenes of sartorial flair, but the bright patterns adorning skirts and dresses worn by women there are more than just eye candy. Messages ranging from the playful to the political are encoded within the prints. During election season, clothes sporting the face of a politician can signify support  —   although that depends on where the face is placed. _____ 10. A    Japanese boy survived six nights alone on the   island of Hokkaido. He had wandered off after being left on the side of the road by his parents as a disciplinary measure, and was found by soldiers on a military base about three miles away. "I’m full of gratitude. From now on, I’m going to take better care of him as he grows up," the boy’s father said. _____ 11. In other rescue news, a    Florida fisherman who fell out of his boat without a life jacket was saved by the Coast Guard after 20 exhausting hours treading water, a local news channel reported. The man, William Durden, said the night was an ordeal but when the sun came up, he felt a surge of optimism. He felt fish hitting his legs, but his fears that a shark "would come out and decide to have me for dinner" went unrealized. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
