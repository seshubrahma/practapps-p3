A North Park University student fabricated a story where she claimed that   Donald Trump supporters had sent her "hateful" notes and emails following the 2016 Election, local police confirmed. [Taylor Volk, the Chicago college student, said on Nov. 14 that she had received notes and emails containing threatening and harassing language, along with mentions to Trump, according to NBC Chicago.  Volk said the notes were tacked onto her door, containing homophobic slurs and Trump references. In a statement from the university, President David Parkyn confirmed that the student had "fabricated" the entire story. "We are confident there is no further threat of repeated intolerance to any member of our campus community stemming from this recent incident," Parkyn said. Parkyn told local media that Volk is no longer enrolled at the university, which serves as an "immigrant gateway community," according to NBC Chicago.
