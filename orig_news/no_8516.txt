During his campaign rally in West Virginia on Thursday night, Donald Trump responded to Breitbart News’s recent interview with former Mexican President Vicente Fox in California on Wednesday, in which Fox apologized for using vulgar language about Trump and invited him to Mexico. ["Vicente Fox was on television last night and he apologized and I accept his apology," Trump told a crowd of more than 12, 000 in Charleston, West Virginia on Thursday, the day after Fox’s apology and invitation. "I thought it was very, very nice, because I was giving him a little hard time about something and he apologized. "  "I thought it was very nice that he apologized," Trump repeated, adding, "We’re going to have a great relationship with Mexico, but we need a border. " On Wednesday, Fox told Breitbart, "I apologize. Forgiveness is one of the greatest qualities that human beings have, is the quality of a compassionate leader. You have to be humble. You have to be compassionate. You have to love thy neighbor. " "Love your nation. Love the world," Fox added. "Yes, I’m humble enough as leadership be, [a] compassionate leader. If I offended you, I’m sorry. But what about the other way around?"
