Friday on the Hugh Hewitt’s syndicated radio show, CBS’s "Face the Nation" host John Dickerson said Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton was likely more "vindictive" than presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.  When asked who would be more vindictive towards their political enemies, Clinton or Trump, Dickerson said, "I think Clinton. Trump is very tough on those he does not like, as I know. But he gets over it. But now having said that, I think about some of the people who are now supporting Hillary Clinton who supported Obama last time, and where there were really hard feelings, and now she’s working in sync with them. So man, that’s a good tough question. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
