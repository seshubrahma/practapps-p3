The NYT advance review of Megyn Kelly’s book Settle for More hints that the Fox News primetime anchor’s memoir appears to allege that Donald Trump may have received word of her debate question in advance  —   and that someone may have poisoned her coffee on the day of the debate.  For the record, my book "Settle for More" does not suggest Trump had any debate Qs in advance, nor do I believe that he did.  —   Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) November 11, 2016,  Also for the record, I believe the reason I got sick the day of the first debate was I contracted a stomach virus, just as Rand Paul did.  —   Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) November 11, 2016,
