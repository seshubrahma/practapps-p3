Donald Trump issued a statement late Friday night that his running mate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence will campaign with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan in Wisconsin on Saturday. [Trump originally planned to campaign with Ryan on Saturday, but after the Washington Post released a tape of the Republican nominee making lewd remarks about women in 2005 on Friday afternoon, Ryan issued a statement late Friday night that Trump won’t be coming to Wisconsin the next day.  "I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests. In the meantime, he is no longer attending tomorrow’s event in Wisconsin," Ryan stated in a press release. Less than half an hour later, the Trump campaign issued a statement announcing he will be prepping for Sunday night’s presidential debate and Pence will be in Wisconsin as his replacement. "Governor Mike Pence will be representing me tomorrow in Wisconsin," Trump stated. "I will be spending the day in New York in debate prep with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Jeff Sessions, and then flying to St. Louis on Sunday for the 2nd Presidential Debate. "
