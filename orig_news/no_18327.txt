’  ’ "   In case you haven’t noticed, Volvo is back. " ’   Over the past few years, the   automaker has made   a stunning recovery from the jaws of financial and return to   prominence as the leading purveyor of safe, sophisticated, and   undeniably Swedish cars. ’ ’   Under the guidance of parent company Geely Holdings, Volvo has   unleashed an   generation of models built around is       Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform and       engines. ’ ’   Chief among this is the   second generation Volvo   XC90 SUV that swept the 2015 award season  —   . ’ "   Leading the charge on this side of the pond is Volvo Cars of   America CEO Lex Kerssemakers. The veteran auto executive sat down   with Business Insider at the 2017 New York International Auto   Show. Our conversation touched on various topics including the   state of the US auto market, the company’s new South Carolina   factory, and Volvo’s plan for autonomous driving. " "   In 2016, automakers sold a record 17. 6 million cars in the US.   But, thus far in 2017, the auto market has struggled to keep up   with last year’s torrid pace.  While Kerssemakers sees   increasing difficulty in trying live up to 2016, he still   believes in the strength of the US market.  " ’  ’ ’   "The pressure is definitely increasing and the level of incentive   spending is up," Kerssemakers said. "But we’’re still talking   about (selling) 16 million to 17 million cars. It’’s still pretty   high, even if we’’re a bit disappointed that it’’s down compared to   last year." ’ "   Further, he believes Volvo’s relatively small market share, when   compared to Detroit’s Big Three, dulls much of the effects of   most sales fluctuations.  " ’   "To be honest, as a brand with 0. 5% to 0. 6% market share, I’’m not   looking everyday at the development of the overall US market in   the same way as brands with greater sales volume like the Big 3,"   the Volvo boss said. "I think it can fluctuate quite a lot before   a brand like Volvo is affected."  ’ ’   One of the tenets of the Trump Administration has been the   bolstering of US manufacturing. For Volvo, the centerpiece of the   US production plan is a new $500 million factory in South   Carolina that is expected to enter service in the third quarter   of 2018.  ’ ’   "We decided two years ago to (manufacture) in the United States   because we wanted to give a clear signal to our retailers, who   have been our loyal partners, and to our customers that we   are here to stay," the affable Dutchman said. "In 2007 and   2008, articles popped up of people saying that Volvo is going to   leave the US market and that’’s absolutely not true. So the best   proof of that is to put a factory on American soil, which we   did." ’ ’  ’ ’   Now with plants in Europe, China, and US, Volvo has domestic   production facilities in the three most important markets in the   world. According to Kerssemakers, local manufacturing brings   Volvo closer to its consumers and shields the company from   fluctuations in the global currencies.  ’ "   The new factory, expected to have the ability churn out 100, 000   cars a year, will produce the company’s next generation S60 sedan   for domestic consumption and export.  " "   In 2015, Volvo made waves by importing its   —   becoming the first major brand to sell     cars in the US. The S60L was originally developed   for China’s chauffeur’s culture, but the car made its debut in   the US as the   Inscription model.  " ’   "We decided to import it two years ago and now it’’s 70% of our   S60 sales in the US because, like the Chinese, Americans like   space as well," he told us. "It’’s a   because the   retailers love it and so the customers."  ’ ’   According to Kerssemakers, the success of the S60L is   representative of the advantages of having a global manufacturing   footprint that allows the company better flexibility to tailor   its product offerings based on regional needs.  ’ ’  ’ "   While it’s become a success, there are still lingering concerns   among the public and the media about China’s ability to produce   cars that are on par with their Swedish counterparts. " ’   "To be honest, there’’s no (difference in quality) at all," the   Volvo chief executive said. "It’’s absolutely a none issue. It’’s   purely between the ears." ’ "   In fact, when the first S60s came in from China, the company’s   dealers went through the car with a fine tooth comb looking for   quality issues and didn’t find anything, Kerssemakers   said.  " ’   "We have a global manufacturing process that includes Swedish   engineers who go to China, train everybody there and see that   everything is running according to Volvo standards," Kerssemakers   told us. "Irrespective of where it’’s produced, it’’s the same   quality." ’ ’   By committing to     turbo   engines and electrification in 2008, Volvo made the bold decision   to push the brand towards the direction of advanced technology   and environmental friendliness rather than traditional luxury. ’ "   Now it’s working towards the next frontier, autonomous   driving.  " "   One of Volvo’s partners in the development of next generation   autonomous technology is Uber. However, the controversial tech   firm’s efforts have been beset by development issues including   the crash of an autonomous XC90 test car in Arizona. " "   However, Volvo is not wavering in its support of Uber’s   autonomous driving program. " ’   "Accidents do happen, but we believe in the partnership with Uber   and we are fully confident that it will continue to be fruitful,"   Kerssemakers said.  ’ ’  ’ ’   However, the Volvo CEO cautioned that the public and the auto   industry should be cautious in the pace of developing autonomous   tech development. ’ ’   "There’’s a lot of talk about autonomous drive, but there are a   lot of systems out there that are not autonomous drive. They are   pilot assist systems," he said. "We should be very careful   that we don’’t start to believe we are there already."  ’ "   In fact, Kerssemakers told us that true level 4 or level 5   autonomy won’t be ready until well into the next decade. " ’   "Every company, every brand is driving millions of test miles   with autonomous cars. So we are still in a test phase," he   said.  ’ "   But, even with Volvo’s new tilt towards high tech, the brand   stands for one thing above all else and that’s safety. As a   result, for Kerssemakers, success in the quest for autonomous   driving doesn’t necessarily mean being first in the marketplace,   rather it’s about being the safest and most reliable.  " ’   "This is not a sprint we want to win and be the first, it’’s not   about that. We want to be leading, but leading means high tech   that’’s reliable and safe," he said.  "For Volvo, it’’s a   marathon, not a sprint." ’ "In case you haven’t noticed, Volvo is back. .." ’’ ’’ ’’
