Several students at the University of   admit that Muslims should not be forced by law to do business with Christians. Those same students, however, had a hard time agreeing that Christians or conservative Americans have the right to decline work that conflicts with their conscience or religion. [In a viral video published by   nonprofit Alliance Defending Freedom (ADL) students were asked if they support Sophie Theallet’s decision not to dress Melania Trump.  Several students agreed that Theallet  —   one of many fashion designers declining to dress the first family  —   has every right to refuse to dress Mrs. Trump. The students were also asked if a Muslim singer solicited by a Christian church to sing had a right to refuse. Again, the students agreed that the Muslim singer has a right to not sing in a Christian church. "Yeah, if that goes against your religious view, I feel you have a right to turn that down," one student said. The students also said that a law forcing Muslims to sing inside a Christian church should not exist. When asked if a Christian photographer should be allowed by law to decline to shoot a   wedding, the students appeared torn. "For them," the ADL notes, "it seems that the freedom to live and work according to your beliefs really depends on what you believe. " Incidentally, Wisconsin resident Amy Lawson, a blogger and owner of Amy Lynn Photography, is challenging a state law forcing her to take photographs for a   marriage.
