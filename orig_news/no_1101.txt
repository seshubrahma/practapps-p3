 Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Today’s introduction comes to us from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles. "We’re going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future," Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House announced minutes after the legislation to repeal the law collapsed in Congress last week. Now some political leaders in California want to go even further. Last month State Senators Ricardo Lara and Toni Atkins introduced legislation to replace private health insurance with a publicly funded health care system run by the state government known as a   system. The bill does not include any details of how the state would pay for the multibillion program, instead simply declaring "it is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would establish a comprehensive universal   health care coverage program and a health care cost control system for the benefit of all residents of the state. " Gov. Jerry Brown, who is both a fiscal hawk and an ardent supporter of Affordable Care Act, has already spoken about his skepticism of a   program, saying it would be prohibitively expensive. But at least one candidate running for governor next year plans to make universal health care a centerpiece of the campaign. Earlier this month Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said he was working with health care experts to craft a plan for a   system. While he was mayor, the city approved a plan to offer universal health care for all of its residents. Mr. Lara said the Republican defeat in Congress could pave the way for a   system. "It’s easier to expand health care than make up lost ground as we would have had to do," he said. "We really have the chance to make universal health care a reality now. " The proposal differs from existing programs in one big way: It would include all residents, regardless of their immigration status. Obamacare explicitly excluded undocumented immigrants from benefits of the program, though children in California can receive basic coverage even if they are undocumented. Advocates of a   program argue that it would bring down costs and encourage preventive care. But opponents say there would be less choice and efficiency in medical care, and that taxes would rise significantly for all residents. This is not the first time state leaders have pressed for a   bill. Similar legislation was passed in 2006 and 2008, though it did not include a way to pay from the system. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill. Do you think California should move to a   system? Email us your thoughts at catoday@nytimes. com.

[LAist] The National Park Service purchased Santa Rosa Island in 1986 from the Vail  Vickers ranch. In 1998, cattle ranching on the island ended for good. But some vestiges of the island’s ranching past still remain. Alana Ayasse, a graduate student studying geography at   Barbara, took the above picture on the island in September, while volunteering for a week with Channel Islands Restoration, a nonprofit that helps tend to the health of plants and animals in the park. She came across the horses while walking back to a field station one evening. "You can just see them wandering up there," Ms. Ayasse said in a phone interview Monday. "They’re supercool. " Ken Owen, the executive director of Channel Islands Restoration, said the horses were kept to a portion of the island where they would not harm any rare plants. "They’re literally a cultural artifact," he said. "And there’s really no reason to remove them. " Want to submit a photo for possible publication? You can do it here.
