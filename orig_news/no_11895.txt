On Friday’s "McLaughlin Group," the Daily Beast’s Eleanor Clift praised presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s reaction to the shooting of police officers in Dallas, TX.  Clift said, "I must say, I’m grateful that Donald Trump put out a very graceful tweet, expressing his sympathy, and canceled his campaign events. So, he did not jump on this and use this to exploit divisions in the country. And, you know, maybe that’s a small sign that our political leaders are going to lead us in the right way in the weeks and months ahead. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
