Canadian pop star Justin Bieber reportedly turned down a $5 million offer to perform in Cleveland during the Republican National Convention on the advice of NBA superstar LeBron James and his manager Scooter Braun, a staunch supporter of Democrat Hillary Clinton. [According to TMZ, Bieber’s agents received a $5 million offer from GOP donors for a " "   concert near the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, where Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination last Thursday.  Bieber was reportedly guaranteed payment up front, and was assured that he did not have to endorse Trump or any other Republican policies. However, Bieber’s manager Scooter Braun and his agents at CAA reportedly thought that despite the assurances from the promoter, the event was definitely political, and that the GOP donors were "using" Bieber. Braun suggested that the pop star hang "Black Lives Matter" banners at the concert, but the request was turned down by the event promoters. Bieber was also told he could not say anything negative about Trump or the GOP. Ultimately, Braun  —   who hosted a   fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in Hollywood last August  —   reportedly told Bieber that he would no longer represent him if he accepted the money. TMZ also reports that the promoter told Bieber that Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James would be at a similar   event in the city during the Republican convention, but when Bieber’s people contacted James’ people, they advised him not to do the performance. Bieber’s band also reportedly did not want to perform in Cleveland. The $5 million offer would have ensured Bieber his biggest paycheck ever for a single concert, according to the gossip outlet.
