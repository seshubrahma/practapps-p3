CNN’s "The Lead" anchor Jake Tapper stated that President Obama’s condemnation of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump doesn’t express "a huge vote of confidence in the way that Hillary Clinton is rebutting Trump" on Tuesday’s "Wolf. "  Tapper said, "Let me also make one observation, which is, obviously President Obama is very eager to get into this political debate, he’s very eager to defend himself, but also to do what he can to stop Donald Trump from becoming president. He feels very strongly that that would be bad for the country. I can’t help but observe that if he thought Hillary Clinton was doing a good job, or an effective job, making the case against Trump, maybe he wouldn’t go to the East Room and make it himself. So in a way, while this is completely a condemnation of Trump and everything Trump stands for, I wouldn’t say that President Obama entering the presidential race this way exactly expresses a huge vote of confidence in the way that Hillary Clinton is rebutting Trump and making the same exact points that the president just made.
