Wednesday in Des Moines, IA, in addressing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumpâ€™s comments about the Second Amendment a day earlier, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said her opponent was attempting a "casual inciting of violence. "  Clinton said,"Let me say something about what I think is a critical difference between my opponent and myself. Words matter, my friends. And if you are running to be president or you are president of the United States, words can have tremendous consequences. Yesterday we witnessed the latest in the long line of casual comments from Donald Trump that cross the line. His casual cruelty to a Gold Star family, his casual suggestion that more countries should have nuclear weapons. And now his casual inciting of violence. Every single one of these incidents shows us that Donald Trump simply does not have the temperament to be president and commander in chief of the United States.
