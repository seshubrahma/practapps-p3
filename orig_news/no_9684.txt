MANCHESTER, New Hampshire  —   Billionaire businessman Donald J. Trump won New Hampshire in a blowout here in the first in the nation primary, with news organizations from CNN to Fox News to the Associated Press and more calling the race for him the second the polls closed statewide at 8 p. m. ET. [Trump’s massive victory sends him into South Carolina the clear national GOP frontrunner after a second place finish in Iowa to Sen. Ted Cruz ( ).  Exit polling proves that Trump, among voters, has won virtually every single issue ranging from immigration to how to handle Muslims to the economy and more. It’s unclear what the final result will be, as Trump’s victory was declared by every major news organization with just a handful of precincts reporting. The real race in New Hampshire now is for who comes in second and third place, and those results will trickle in over the course of the night. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is expected to come in second, but third place may go to anyone from Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to Sen. Marco Rubio ( ). That Rubio crashed after an abysmal debate performance Saturday night has destroyed much of the establishment and mainstream media’s carefully crafted plans to take down the   Trump and Cruz in later states.
