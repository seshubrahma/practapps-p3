From Dave Weigel and Katie Zezima in the Washington Post:  MYRTLE BEACH, S. C.  —   Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) continued his rhetorical onslaught against Donald Trump on Saturday, casting him as a false conservative and questioning the real estate mogul’s temperament and judgment. "Donald’s record does not match what he says as a candidate," Cruz told reporters after a forum in Fort Mill, S. C. "It seems Donald has a lot of nervous energy.

Trump escalated his attacks Saturday morning, saying in a tweet that additional lawsuits will be filed questioning Cruz’s eligibility to be president. At a rally in Portsmouth, N.

"How do you control . . . these big powerful banks, you’re a senator and yet you owe them money with a personal guarantee?" Trump said to a crowd of about 500. Trump said Goldman "owns" Cruz and he will "Do anything they demand. " Cruz’s wife is on leave from her job as a managing director at Goldman. In another tweet, Trump called Cruz the "ultimate hypocrite," linking to a story about how Cruz attended an event at the New York home of two wealthy gay businessmen.
