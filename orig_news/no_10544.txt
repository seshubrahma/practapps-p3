Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump sailed past his own campaign’s prediction on the final delegate count, and now heads into next month’s Republican National Convention. [After the final five state Republican primaries on Tuesday night, Trump stands at 1, 536 delegates.  In April, Trump’s campaign predicted it would reach 1, 400 delegates ahead of the convention to meet the threshold delegate requirement of 1, 237 in order to clinch the nomination on the first ballot. Trump broke the Republican primary record by 1. 4 million votes, according to the conservative blog site, The Gateway Pundit. Breitbart News earlier reported that following the New York primary in April, Trump already had two million more votes than GOP nominee Mitt Romney did in 2012.
