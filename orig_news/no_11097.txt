Fox News host Megyn Kelly is coming out with a new book about her year covering  —   and feuding  —   with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. [Kelly, who has repeatedly said countless times that she doesn’t want to be part of the story, teased her book at the close of her interview with Trump on Tuesday:  In addition to the "Kelly File" I have been working on a project, a book, which I’m unveiling right now. It’s called Settle for More, my life motto ever since I was an unhappy lawyer years ago. The book shows how I did just that with some tears and laughs along the way. And yes, for the fist time I will speak openly about my year with Donald Trump. You can   it now wherever books are sold. It hits stores November 15th. Trump and Kelly feuded after Trump thought a debate question that Kelly asked him during the GOP primary debate in Cleveland, Ohio last summer was "unfair" where she asked him about calling women names on Twitter.
