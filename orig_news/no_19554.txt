’  ’ ’   Amazon’’s original series "The Man in the High Castle" has quickly   become known for its provocative marketing.  ’ ’   Last year, advertisements for the first season of the show  —     which depicts a world in which the Allies lost World War II  —     included  on its shuttle line   between Times Square and Grand Central covered in the US flag   with a German imperial eagle and iron crosses on one side and   Japanese   flags on the other.   ’ ’   Amazon puled the ads due to public outrage over the     imagery. ’ ’   Now for season two, Amazon has ads of the Statue of Liberty   giving the Nazi salute (also known as the Hitler salute). A giant   billboard of Lady Liberty giving the salute is now up in Times   Square, Gothamist reports. ’ ’ ’ " ’t’t’tStatue Of Liberty Gives Nazi Salute In Huge Times Square Billboard For Amazon’s ’The Man In The High Castle’   " "   People on Twitter can’t help but compare the ad to the current   political landscape, in which there have been reports of  celebrating the victory of     Donald Trump.
