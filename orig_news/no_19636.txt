’    ’ ’  ’ ’ After nearly 30 years of writing, Michael Lewis has tackled   his first love story. ’ ’ Lewis, the author of "" and ","   didn’’t go the typical romance route, though. His new book,   "," tells the story of Daniel "Danny" Kahneman   and Amos Tversky, two best friends who revolutionized cognitive   psychology. ’ ’ As Lewis put it to Business Insider, the relationship between   these two brilliant Israeli psychologists "was a love story   without the sex." ’ " Kahneman’s and Tversky’s personalities and ideas perfectly   complemented each other’s. They understood each other in ways no   one else could, and this resulted in groundbreaking work on   judgment and   through the 1970s and ’80s. " ’ Tversky died from cancer in 1996, but Kahneman has continued   to develop their ideas and generate many new ones, and he was   awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002. ’ " Kahneman and Tversky’s theories have influenced medicine and   public policy, and led to the founding of behavioral economics   and an analytic approach to crafting professional sports   teams. " ’ And while their work has been explored for many years, Lewis   was in a unique position to tell the human story behind the ideas    —   Lewis taught Tversky’’s son Oren during his teaching fellowship   at the University of California at Berkeley in the late ’’90s and   would later help Kahneman shape his 2011 bestseller, "." ’ ’ We sat down with Lewis to discuss "The Undoing Project," and   how Kahneman and Tversky’’s ideas can offer a valuable lens for   viewing Donald Trump’’s election, Wall Street, and sports. ’ ’ This interview has been edited for clarity and length. ’ ’Richard Feloni: A central theme of "The Undoing   Project" is the fallibility of human judgment. This entire   election season was filled with surprises not predicted by polls   or pundits on either side. How do you look at this election year   using Kahneman and Tversky’’s theories? ’ ’Michael Lewis: When I wrote "The Undoing   Project," I was not thinking of the American election, and I did   not think Donald Trump was going to be elected president. But one   of the great things about Amos Tversky and Danny Kahneman is they   give you a lens for interpreting human behavior and you can   filter the whole election through them. ’ ’  ’ "   The first thing they would say is people don’t like uncertainty,   and their minds are tools for making sense of the world, even   when the world is senseless. They dislike uncertainty so much   that they will impose an order on it even when it doesn’t exist.   And in their leaders, advisers, and experts, they much prefer   overconfidence, total certainty, to any kind of doubt. " "   I’d say part of the appeal of Trump is that he’s presenting   himself as a totally certain, infallible person. " "   Then there’s anchoring. Amos and Danny did these studies where   they’d give their lab subjects a wheel of fortune with the   numbers one to 100 on it and have them spin the wheel. And then,   after subjects get a number, they ask them what they think the   percentage of countries in the United Nations come from Africa.   And people who had spun a high number would guess a higher   percentage than people who had spun a low number. Amos and Danny   showed that you could anchor the mind into answering a question a   certain way by giving them a totally unrelated piece of   information dropped before. " ’   Trump’’s anchoring people every which way. "There are millions of   illegal voters." Everything’’s "huge." I don’’t think he’’s doing it   consciously, but he does very well in kind of inserting himself   into those kind of chinks in our mental armor. ’ ’Feloni: What about looking at the way that those   who opposed Trump are struggling to accept it? ’ ’Lewis: Danny and Amos studied the rules of the   human imagination when it tries to undo something, tries to   create an alternative reality. Say a loved one dies in an   accident. You imagine, "If only they hadn’’t been on that train   when it went off the rails  —   if only." After the election, some   people tried to undo Trump. They started with the outcome and   worked their way back to find the first thing they could undo to   change the outcome. So the first thing they could undo was the   FBI director stirring up trouble about Hillary’’s emails, when   really there are all kinds of things that could have happened   that would have changed the election. ’ ’   The last thing I’’ll say is that Danny and Amos pointed out that   when something happens people didn’’t predict, they find ways to   explain it as if it were predictable. And you see this in spades   in our country right now. You’’ll be amazed by how many people   will have "predicted" this thing a year from now, who didn’’t see   it the day before Election Day. The tone of the commentary is   already like, "If you had been out there and you’’d taken the   pulse of the ordinary American, you’’d have seen it coming," as if   it were a failure of intelligence. But that’’s not what it was at   all! It was a kind of accident. He got almost 3 million fewer   votes than Hillary Clinton! He happened to get more in some of   the right places. It was just like one of those things where a   stock going up and people impose a false sense of order on it.   It’’s really more intellectually honestly viewed as a disorderly   process. ’ ’Feloni: What made you want to tell the story of   Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky? What do you want readers to   learn about their personal lives? ’ " WATCH: Why Lewis wrote ’The Undoing           Project’ " "Lewis: I always find with my stories that the   way they start is that I just get so interested in a person that   I’m compelled to go back to them over and over until I learn more   and more about them, without even quite thinking it’s material   for a book. Maybe I’m thinking it’s a magazine piece. What set me   over the edge with this story was, one, the sheer level of   interest of the two main characters. They have great literary   dimensions. Two, the peculiar passionate relationship between   them, which was a love story without the sex. Their children were   ideas. " ’   And three, was just the influence of their ideas. You see them   everywhere. There are people in medicine who will tell you that   they’’ve deeply influenced medical diagnosis and the way doctors   think about their jobs. On Wall Street, you go back to the   origins of the suspicion of stock picking, the beginning of the   movement toward index funds, and their fingerprints are all over   that. They’’re also all over "Moneyball," the whole statistical   movement in sports. Every place where big data and algorithms are   challenging experts, you will find Kahneman and Tversky in the   room. ’ "   There just aren’t many stories that are this good. It was a   really good, really important story, and I had peculiar access to   it. " ’Feloni: How do their personal stories shed light   on their theories? ’ ’  ’ ’   The thing about their relationship and the intensity of their   feelings for each other was that it was so important in their   work. The ideas are all about human fallibility  —   human   vulnerability, even  —   and their origin largely starts with Danny   Kahneman exploring his own fallibility, his own vulnerability.   But he was incapable of doing that by himself, in part because he   was so unsure of himself. Amos created a safe place in which   Danny felt not only confidence but a kind of unconditional   acceptance and love. ’ "   The strength of that relationship is what enabled them to explore   what’s weak in people. And it was the great insight into   themselves  —   particularly looking into Danny  —   that was the   source of their idea generation. So it’s not surprising that when   the relationship started to fracture that the ideas also started   to dry up. " ’Feloni: Your previous book, ""  —   about  gathering a team to take on what he felt to be   abuses of   trading  —   also had protagonists shaking   things up. In the two years since that was published, his firm,    has become an   exchange and is planning on listing companies in 2017. Your book   had the effect of making them celebrities of sorts. Are they   meeting your expectations? ’ "Lewis: They have exceeded my expectations. The   world around them has also exceeded my expectations in their   attempts to stop them from actually improving the markets. I   think the game is slightly changing, and that because they’re now   an exchange, they can generate data showing what is essentially   the grift that goes on in other exchanges  —   what it costs   investors to trade on those versus on an exchange like IEX that   is actually trying to level the playing field and not give     traders an advantage. The game is going to be   getting that information now. " ’   I didn’’t know what the reaction to "Flash Boys" was going to be,   because although I have written other Wall Street books, I’’d   never written one that threatened to take away money from people.   And it’’s still unclear how big those sums of money are, but it’’s   clearly billions of dollars a year. Now I know what happens when   you do that  —   you generate essentially an opposition political   campaign against a book. It was as fraudulent as many political   campaigns are. ’ ’ WATCH: Lewis explains how Wall Street has           changed ’ "   And the truth is, this isn’t my war to fight. It’s Brad   Katsuyama’s war to fight  —   I am an interloper. I came in because   I was really interested in a pretty simple thing: what happens   when someone tries to introduce moral considerations into Wall   Street, what happens when someone wants to actually demand of   himself and those who work with him that what they do is not just   profitable but good and useful. " "   I feel a little bad for Brad Katsuyama and the people at IEX  —     they’re on their own doing this  —   but I think it’s going to be   OK. It may take a little while, but I think they’re going to be a   very, very big part of the stock market. " "Feloni: Polls increasingly show . What does Wall Street look like to you now   compared to when you were in it in the ’80s? " ’Lewis: What’’s happened to Wall Street since   "" came out in ’’89 is that its relationship with the rest   of society has become much more problematic. It’’s become cagier,   more guarded, closed, and afraid of how it seems to the wider   world. More political. But it’’s not clear to me it’’s become less   profitable! ’ "   If you’re the kind of kid who thinks that all that’s important in   life is making money, it’s probably still the place to go,   especially now that Trump’s elected. In Wall Street now, you have   to hide what you’re doing. It’s more fun when you don’t have to   do that. But I don’t think its sense of purpose has changed at   all. " ’  ’ "   Now, the exception is that there are disruptors who are trying to   fix the financial system with entrepreneurship, like Brad   Katsuyama. You find great purpose there, but you may not find   great profits when the game you’re playing is making a living by   reducing the size of Wall Street, sucking some of the revenues   out of it, and reducing the tax the   levies on   the rest of the economy. You’re not going to get rich doing that   like you get rich figuring out how to increase the tax. " ’Feloni: You discuss in the introduction to "The   Undoing Project" the legacy of your book "Moneyball" and its   protagonist, former Oakland A’’s General Manager Billy Beane.   Since the book was published in 2003, the analytics approach to   building a pro sports team has become standard. How can scouts be   useful in this environment? ’ ’Lewis: I thought about this back when   "Moneyball" was published. Billy Beane, he didn’’t ask for my   opinion, but I told him, you’’ve got this army of scouts, and   they’’re not doing what they should be doing. They’’re eyeballing   the players and judging if they can be   players based   on small sample sizes, the games they happen to attend. You get a   much better picture of their professional potential when you’’re   dealing with a big body of data. ’ "   What scouts should be doing is figuring out if these players have   a drug problem, if they may have a difficult time living away   from home, if they have weird problems with their teammates, if   they don’t listen to their coach, or if they’re hiding an injury.   What you should do is basically hire a bunch of young journalists   to go figure out who these people are, because some of that   information will be helpful. " ’   The trick is figuring out what the algorithm does well and what   people do well. ’ " WATCH: Lewis weighs in on Trump’s           election " ’Feloni: One of the narrative arcs that shows up   often in your work has an outsider  —   maybe this person was   laughed at by people in positions of power  —   and then this person   goes on to shake things up and influence the people who once   mocked him. Does Trump fit into one of these Michael Lewis   stories? ’ ’Lewis: [Laughs] The problem is my characters are   actually usually pretty smart and admirable and I don’’t think   he’’s either. So the answer is "unlikely"! You never know. Look,   just because you’’ve been successful and just because you’’ve   disrupted an environment, doesn’’t mean you’’re a role model or   that you actually have anything to teach anybody. There’’s an   awful lot of luck and accident in the world, and maybe you were   just on the receiving end of that. ’
