Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart took several jabs at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday while hosting a ceremony in celebration of the 75th anniversary of the United Service Organizations (USO). [A   Stewart began his short remarks by likening Trump’s campaign rhetoric to the "crazy" things that Vice President Joe Biden says.  "He’ll say whatever he kind of thinks of, whatever comes to his mind, sort of impulsive," Stewart said of Biden, who was also in attendance Thursday. "Sometimes, you might think to yourself, ‘That sounds crazy,’ or ‘Man, that is crazy,’" he continued, before firing at Trump: "And who would have thought that now, that gets you the Republican nomination. " Stewart’s Trump joke was met with resounding boos from the crowded room of military men and women.  "Don’t worry, Trump’s going to keep you busy when he’s the  " Stewart said. "You’re going to have to repaint all the planes with ‘Trump’ in big, gold letters. " When Biden took the stage, he turned the joke back around on Stewart. "I was going to say something nice about Jon, but to hell with him," Biden quipped. The United Service Organizations (USO) offers services and provides live entertainment to U. S servicemen and their families. Stewart was, of course, famously supportive of President Obama and took secret visits to the White House during pivotal moments in his presidency. Stewart’s knock on Trump came on the heels of news that Stewart could reappear on television  —   on HBO, with whom he signed a   production deal in November  —   just before a likely general election matchup between Trump and Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton.
