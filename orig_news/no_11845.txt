GOP frontrunner Donald Trump says New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who endorsed him last week, would make a great attorney general. ["Would Christie make a good attorney general in a Donald Trump administration?" conservative radio host Howie Carr of The Howie Carr Show asked the real estate mogul on Tuesday.  "I think he’d make a great attorney general. He’s a very talented guy. We haven’t even discussed that," Trump responded. "I watched him make Marco Rubio literally, I thought he was going to faint. I was getting ready to catch him," Trump said about the heated debate exchange between Christie and Rubio in New Hampshire where Christie called out Rubio’s memorized talking points. "He had a total breakdown on the stage. And I watched Chris do that," Trump recalled. "I was very impressed with Chris," he added.
