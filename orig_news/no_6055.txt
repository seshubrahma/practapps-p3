Union electrical workers at a Philadelphia job site hung a huge banner welcoming President Donald Trump to the city, highlighting his high support among rank and file members of skilled unions. [The union members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers unfurled their banner, which said "Buy American" and "Welcome to Philly Mr. President. "  Fox News contributor and pollster Frank Luntz caught the Thursday display and tweeted about it. The @IBEW Local Union #98 welcomes President Trump.

According to the Columbus Dispatch newspaper: In Ohio, Trump won among union voters, earning the support of 49 percent of those polled to Clinton’s 44 percent. In 2012, by comparison, Obama received 60 percent of Ohio’s union vote, while Romney received 37 percent. Trump won because    union members voted for him and against their bosses.  #GOPRetreat https:  .   —   Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) January 26, 2017,  To emphasize how different this Republican President is from prior Republicans in the White House, Trump met with a group of union leaders only days after he took the oath of office. Many of the unions’ leaders are also progressive   in the Democratic Party’s political machine, and so it was not long before the IBEW’s   banner disappeared from the Philly construction site. Luntz noted that, too: The banner has now been taken down. Why are union supervisors silencing their    members?  #GOPRetreat pic. twitter.   —   Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) January 26, 2017,  The unfurling of the banner coincided with the President’s trip to Philly to address the Republican retreat which kicked off on Wednesday.
