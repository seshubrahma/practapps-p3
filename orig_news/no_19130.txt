’  ’ "   Donald Trump suggested Ted Cruz’s father had conspired to kill   John F. Kennedy. " ’   He threatened to  Heidi. ’ "   He sent a    especially compared to Trump’s third wife who, like Trump’s   first wife, was a model. " ’   He argued Cruz was  and questioned his religious faith, noting,   "not too many Evangelicals come out of Cuba, OK?" ’ ’   When the National Enquirer  Trump issued a written statement saying he had   "no idea" whether the Enquirer story was true, then   adding "they were right about O.
