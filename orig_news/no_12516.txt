TAMPA  —   Wednesday in the lead up to an appearance by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at the Florida State Fairgrounds, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani praised the enthusiastic crowd in attendance and took a dig at Trump’s opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. ["I want to say something for the media that is covering this: Do you think that Hillary Clinton could produce a crowd with this kind of enthusiasm?" he said. "I can think of only one really enthusiastic crowd that would gather for Hillary Clinton  —   a grand jury. Boy, would I love to present that case. Now they would have enthusiasm. "  The attendees chanted "lock her up" in unison, but Giuliani was quick to say that defeating her at the ballot box would be the best method of recourse for her alleged wrongdoing because the Department of Justice under President Barack Obama had failed its duties by refusing to handle a case that he described to be bigger than Watergate and possibly the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920s. "I gave a lot of my life to the Justice Department," he said. "Now I am embarrassed of and I believe it has been made into a disgrace by their refusal to handle the case against Hillary Clinton like they would handle the case against you. I am more than willing to predict when the history of our day is written, the scandal you are watching unfold is going to be like the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920’s and maybe bigger. " "It’s going to be bigger than Watergate," he continued. "Nixon had to leave office and he did a lot of bad things, but it wasn’t raking in millions and millions of dollars through a phony charity. I’m not sure how much money was involved in the Teapot Dome, but I bet it could not have been much more than the hundreds of millions of dollars the Clintons have been getting and turning the State Department into a    operation.
