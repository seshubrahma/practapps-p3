While CBS CEO Les Moonves is not sold on presidential candidate Donald Trump making America great again, he said on Monday about how beneficial the GOP frontrunner’s candidacy has been for his company’s bottom line. ["It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS," Moonves said of Trump at a Morgan Stanley investors’ conference in San Francisco, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  Commenting on the race for the White House, which he equated to a "circus," the network executive said the candidates are not discussing issues, but rather engaging in "bomb throwing. " "Most of the ads are not about issues," he said. "They’re sort of like the debates. " While leftwing Late Show host Stephen Colbert struggles to stay competitive with Jimmy Fallon over at NBC, Trump has apparently proven a reliable source for viewers and ad revenue for CBS. "Donald’s place in this election is a good thing   …     who would have expected the ride we’re all having right now?" Moonves said. "The money’s rolling in and this is fun. " He further commented: "I’ve never seen anything like this, and this going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It’s a terrible thing to say. But, bring it on, Donald. Keep going. "
