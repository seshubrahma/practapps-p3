’  ’ "   In an essay for  Nobel Prize winning economist  nailed   why the ’Make America Great Again’ slogan resonated with so many   Donald Trump supporters. " ’   From his essay: ’ ’    ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ "   This is the part where it’s really worth pointing out that not   all Trump supporters are struggling economically. In fact, the   average income of a Trump supporter  " ’   But make no mistake, this kind of "no handouts" thinking appeals   to them too. It means they don’’t have to pay higher taxes to   subsidize the advancement of those left behind by globalization   and technological change. They don’’t have to pay to teach coal   miners to do something else, or send their kids to community   colleges.  ’ ’   Why, they wonder, should some wealthier Americans have to care   for others less fortunate? ’ "   That mindset even extends to the billionaire class  —   people you   would think wouldn’t even notice a few million sent to the   government in order to pave roads, build schools, and reeducate   workers. " ’   Take, for instance, comments made by billionaire investor Sam   Zell this spring in front of an  He was speaking with his fellow   billionaire, T.
