Melania Trump, Donald Trump’s wife, accepted his apology for lewd remarks he made in a 2005 video, she said in a statement the campaign released on Saturday afternoon. The potential future First Lady called on the country to join her in accepting her husband’s apology and supporting his efforts to focus on key issues facing the nation and the world. ["The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me," Melania Trump said. "This does not represent the man that I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world. "  Melania Trump had just married Donald Trump before the 2005 video incident which was leaked to the mainstream media this week. They have been happily married since then, and she gave a powerful speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July —  and has been one of Donald Trump’s strongest supporters throughout this campaign even though she has largely operated from behind the scenes.  The issuance of this statement shows how strongly she supports her husband, and shows how seriously the campaign is taking this matter, since Melania Trump rarely speaks out in public. Her acceptance of his apology —  which he issued in a video statement late Friday night —  and imploring of the country to support him and join her in accepting his apology may eventually put a stop to the political fallout Trump is facing. Many establishment Republicans —  most of whom never supported Trump or opposed his candidacy for the presidency from the beginning —  have withdrawn their support for him in the wake of the video release. Trump intends to appear at the debate in St. Louis, Missouri, on Sunday evening —  an appearance that could determine the fate of his campaign, and the fate of the nation itself.
