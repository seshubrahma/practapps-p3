’  ’ "   John Kasich isn’t on the best terms with Donald Trump, but that   apparently didn’t stop Trump from making his former rival an   unusual offer. " ’   Kasich, who dropped out of the presidential race in early May   after winning only his home state of Ohio, has declared that he    as his vice   president, calling the entire process "." ’ ’   While he was still in the race, he  Trump was "not prepared to be president of the   United States," and even  in a   effort to stop   Trump. ’ ’   Even now, Kasich  the Republican National Convention, which is   being held in the state he governs. ’ "   But according to an unnamed Kasich adviser who spoke with    Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. reached out   to him with an enticing proposal for the Ohio governor. " ’’ ’   Did Kasich want to serve as vice president? More specifically, as   characterized by The Times, the "most powerful vice president   ever"? ’ "   Trump Jr. reportedly explained that his father’s vice president   would be put in charge of foreign and domestic policy. The Kasich   adviser then asked what Trump himself would be in charge of if   that were the case. " ’   His reply? ’ ’   "Making America great again," according to The Times. ’ "   This isn’t the first time someone in Trump’s inner circle has   suggested that Trump isn’t interested in the    work of   the American presidency. In a May  Paul Manafort, now the Trump   campaign manager, explained what Trump was looking for in a   running mate. " ’   "He needs an experienced person to do the part of the job he   doesn’’t want to do," Manafort said. "He seems himself more as the   chairman of the board than even the CEO, let alone the COO." ’ "   And Trump himself indicated to  a few weeks ago that he wasn’t sure he’d   accept the presidency if he won. " ’   "I’’ll let you know how I feel about it after it happens," he   said. ’
