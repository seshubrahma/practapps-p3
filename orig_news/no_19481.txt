’  ’ ’   Top Donald Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway noted Thursday the      last weekend and his potential appointment as secretary of state. ’ ’   The former Massachusetts governor and 2012 GOP presidential   nominee is  for the role in   the Trump administration. ’ ’   "Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re:   Romney,"  Thursday morning, linking to a story titled, "Some   Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state." ’ "   Some Trump loyalists  that   Romney, who was one of Trump’s harshest critics, could   potentially be allowed in Trump’s inner circle. Mike Huckabee,   Newt Gingrich, and Fox News host Sean Hannity were among the   loudest detractors. " ’   Gingrich questioned whether Romney would act in his own     as secretary of state. ’ ’’ "   Conway, who was Trump’s campaign manager during the election,   appeared to acknowledge critics’ concerns, arguing the merits of   previous secretaries of state  —   Henry Kissinger, who was   appointed by Richard Nixon, and George P. Shultz, who worked with   Ronald Reagan. " ’   They "flew around the world less," Conway wrote, "counseled POTUS   close to home more. And were loyal. Good checklist." ’ ’   Trump supporter and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani   is also being considered for the post. It is unclear when a   selection will be announced. ’
