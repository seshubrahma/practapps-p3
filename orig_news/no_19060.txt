" ’ found that, in a   presidential race that   includes Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee   Jill Stein, Clinton is ahead of Trump by 3 points among likely   voters. ’ ’   In early August, Clinton was up 13 points on Trump in the same     poll. ’ ’   Another poll,  showed   similar results, with Clinton up 5 points on Trump in a     race. ’ ’   "After a strong bump in Clinton’’s favor following the national   party conventions, the electorate in Wisconsin has returned to   about where the vote stood in July, prior to the conventions,"   said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll   and professor of law and public policy. ’ ’’ "   The Marquette poll showed that Clinton’s favorability has dropped   off considerably while Trump’s already dismal mark stagnated.   Clinton was viewed favorably by 35% of respondents, while   63% viewed her unfavorably. In early August, the poll showed that   43% of Wisconsin voters viewed the Democratic nominee favorably,   while 53% held unfavorable views of her. By comparison, Trump’s   favorability improved 1 point from early August, going   from 27% to 28%. " ’   In 2012, President Barack Obama defeated former Massachusetts   Gov. Mitt Romney by 7 points in the Badger State. ’ ’   "The current   race in Wisconsin is looking a   lot like the 2012 contest right now," said Patrick Murray,   director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. ’ ’   The Marquette poll surveyed 803 registered Wisconsin voters by   landline and cellphone from August 25 through 28. The margin   of error is 4. 5 percentage points. The Monmouth poll was   conducted over landlines and cellphones from August 27 to 30,   using a sample of 404 likely Wisconsin voters. The margin of   error for that poll was 4. 9 percentage points. ’
