Donald Trump said that we are facing a massive problem with Russia if Democrats continue to lead U. S. foreign policy. Trump proposed meeting with Vladimir Putin after he is elected but before he takes office in order to cool tensions. ["Frankly, if we got along with Russia, and knocked out ISIS, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing," Trump said Monday on Michael Savage’s radio show, adding:  Now, if there’s anything with Russia, they say Russia loves Donald Trump. Putin loves Donald Trump. And they insult him constantly. I mean, no wonder he can’t stand Obama and Hillary Clinton. But, it is a very serious problem. I think it is the worst, it’s the worst situation we’ve had with Russia since the end of the Cold War by far. The problem is, Putin has no respect for Obama at all. Doesn’t like him and doesn’t respect him. And Obama doesn’t like Putin. They have a great dislike for each other  …    And I think that, you have potentially a very catastrophic situation here. "If I win on November 8th  …    I could see myself meeting with Putin and meeting with Russia prior to the start of the administration," Trump said. Trump doubled down on his claims that the election is being rigged. He said to Michael Savage: This despite the press, which is horrible, phony. They print lies. They want to put lies on all the time. Michael, there’s a backlash like we’ve never seen before. I just heard from Mike Pence. He said there’s a backlash like you’ve never seen. People know it’s all phony stuff. And that’s why I say that the election’s rigged. It’s rigged by the media! They’re willing to put   stories on that are lies. "They’re also, if you look at the polls and the polling places in various cities, they’re also rigged in the cities. Let’s not kid ourselves, in different places. " "They’re incompetent people. Obama is incompetent as a president and Hillary is beyond that," Trump said.
