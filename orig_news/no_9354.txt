  rapper YG led a crowd of 20, 000 of his fans in the collective recitation of his   anthem, "F**K Donald Trump," at the Coachella Music Festival. [The rapper posted a video of the   performance to his Facebook page:  "F**K Donald Trump" is perhaps one of the most popular songs of which the GOP frontrunner is the subject. In it, YG, with the assistance of Nipsy Hussle, warns the Republican presidential candidate to stay out of Los Angeles unless he wants his "shit" to get "crashed. " "Surprised El Chapo ain’t tried to snipe you. Surprised the Nation of Islam ain’t tried to find you. Have a rally out in L. A. we gon’ fuck it up," YG sings. Earlier in April, the    rapper attempted to shoot a music video for the song. But the impromptu video shoot, which quickly devolved into chaos, was shutdown by LAPD officers.  First they pulled out tasers, then pistols, then SHOTGUNS. Not sure any of that was necessary, but my nigga @nipseyhussle executed like a professional. Hands up. We was all in a peaceful FUCK DONALD TRUMP mood. No rioting, no fighting, we were together. I guess expressing political views with togetherness requires police to pull out shotguns.
