Thursday on Capitol Hill after a   meeting between the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( )  Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who also attended the meeting, told MSNBC’s Katy Tur discussed the need for this meeting, which he said was due in part to how soon the race for the party’s nod ended.  Priebus said, "It was a positive mood, a mood of cooperation and a feeling that it’s time to unify the party. I think both parties wanted to do that. It was great. It was really a positive step towards unification. " He continued, "I’m not going to get into the specifics. I hate to spoil the fun. It was a private meeting, private conversation. Certainly everything you’re hearing about is accurate, that it was all positive and it was cooperative, it was great. " He said, "This thing was supposed to be over a month from now or two months from now. Everyone was a little caught off guard how quick it all ended. We all were surprised. " Priebus added, "People didn’t think this thing was going to be over two weeks ago. People thought that Senator Cruz was going to least go to California. That didn’t happen.
