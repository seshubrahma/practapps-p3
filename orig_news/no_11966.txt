New Jersey Governor Chris Christie rallied with Donald Trump in Oklahoma last night, mocking Sen. Marco Rubio for his newfound willingness to attack Donald Trump. ["Let’s have one more message for someone who has had a pretty big mouth today  —   Marco Rubio, your campaign is almost over, buddy," Christie said.  The New Jersey Governor said that Rubio was showing "desperation" after trying to attack Trump, but asserted that none of his punches were landing. "Donald Trump represents strength and Marco Rubio represents Washington D. C.," he said. "We don’t need any more D. C. politicians!"
