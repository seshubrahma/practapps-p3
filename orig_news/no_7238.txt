He was barely five years old. The family moved to Los Angeles, where John’s grandfather, Manuel, who had been a miner in Mexico, worked as a gardener. John’s grandmother, Carmen, put in long hours as a seamstress at a sweatshop. John’s father grew up to work "odd jobs," until he settled as a bus driver for the local transit authority. He married his   sweetheart, a Latina from Los Angeles. After graduating from Cathedral, Castillo went to boot camp in San Diego: he joined the Marine Corps in 1996 and remained on active duty for five years, mostly working as a truck driver, carrying artillery. He served in Japan and Singapore, and left a few months before  . He felt at home with the Marines. There were "un montón" (a bunch) of Hispanics, he says now: "perhaps more than half. " Castillo remembers the thrill of "loud, powerful, and motivating" weaponry. A tattoo on his right forearm reads "USMC. " After the Marines, Castillo moved back to California and went to work for U. P. S. He’s now an inspector for an aerospace company. He was once a Democrat but is now a conservative and a Republican. The transition happened in the Marines. "The way they scream at you, it hardens you," he says. "It makes you understand the importance of respecting the law. " He also thinks travel helped him get rid of a "naïve" point of view that he associates with liberal politics. He believes in the importance of the Second Amendment. At   years old, Castillo speaks softly, wears   glasses, and has the build you’d expect from someone who once carried   shells for a living but now sits inside a cubicle. When we last met, in Eagle Rock, in northeast Los Angeles, he seemed concerned about crime in the area. "If you were allowed to carry a concealed weapon here, you could protect yourself," he says. His Twitter bio reads "devout Catholic" and "lifelong pro wrestling fan. " He’s also a fan of   radio, and he retweets Pope Francis and the W. W. E. with equal enthusiasm. And he is also a passionate supporter of Donald Trump.   9:14: Cruz challenges Trump to debate on O’Reilly’s show: . @tedcruz: Why don’t you ask Donald Trump to come here and defend himself pic. twitter.   —   POLITICO (@politico) March 23, 2016,  9:12: Enthusiasm for Trump in Arizona: 1 man tells me this is longest line he’s seen in his 27 yrs voting @ precinct in Scottsdale, chalks it up to Trump. pic. twitter.   —   Jacqueline Alemany (@JaxAlemany) March 22, 2016,  9:10: Sanders in Hollywood: Backstage at #Kimmel  —   NEW show tonight with Senator Bernie Sanders @SenSanders 11:35|10:35c #ABC pic. twitter.   —   Jimmy Kimmel Live (@JimmyKimmelLive) March 23, 2016,  And then @BernieSanders walked along Hollywood Boulevard that one time. pic. twitter.   —   Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) March 22, 2016,  9:05: Cruz slamming Trump on his home turf of New York: Cruz: "New Yorkers know Donald Trump.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2016,  6:13: Piers Morgan: Time to Start Listening to Trump on Islamic Terrorism. Trump told me countries must tighten their borders in light of these terror attacks, especially to anyone related to an ISIS fighter in Syria. Is he so wrong? He told me he wants   Muslims to root out the extremists in their midst, expressing his bafflement and anger that someone like Abdeslam was able to hide for so long in the very part of Brussels he had previously lived. Is he so wrong? He told me America must make it far harder for illegal immigrants to enter the U. S. and thinks European countries should follow suit. Is he so wrong? He told me he believes there are now areas of many major European cities which have become poisonous breeding grounds for radicalized Islamic terror. Is he so wrong? I didn’t feel I was talking to a lunatic, as many seem to view Trump. I saw a guy, a   unfettered by PC language restraints, who is genuinely furious at the devastation which ISIS is wreaking, and seriously concerned for the security of his fellow Americans and indeed, the citizens of Europe. 6:05: Clinton to deliver counterterrorism speech at Stanford tomorrow: Just because:Sanders’ FP speech yesterday at a Salt Lake City high school Clinton’s FP speech will be at @Stanford https:  .   —   Kylie Atwood (@kylieatwood) March 22, 2016,  Hillary Clinton will have more to say about ISIS and he attack in Brussels tomorrow at Stanford pic. twitter.   —   Chris Megerian (@ChrisMegerian) March 22, 2016,  5:45: Trump says we have a "radical Islamic terrorism" problem like we’ve never had before.

He blasts Obama for being politically correct. When pressed on his "policing" Muslim neighborhoods comment, Cruz says we have seen for seven years that being afraid to name the threat of "radical Islamic terrorism" has made us vulnerable. Cruz says that does not mean targeting Muslims. It means targeting radical Islamic terrorists before they carry out acts of terrorism. He cites Bloomberg’s efforts in New York and says de Blasio was "foolish" for ending it. Cruz says we have to target neighborhoods where radicalism festers like you would a neighborhood with a high level of gang activity. When Cooper asks Cruz if he can name a neighborhood he would like to see policed for radicalism, Cruz cites Bloomberg’s program in New York. When Cooper asks how he would identify communities that need patrolling, Cruz gives a vague answer of focusing on communities where there are increased "incidents of radical Islamic terrorism.

Gary Johnson has a message for Republicans flirting with the idea of taking over the Libertarian Party to run an   candidate for president: Bring it on. Mr. Johnson, the former New Mexico governor who won 1. 3 million votes as the Libertarian presidential nominee in 2012 and is running again this year, said in an interview that he’d welcome an intraparty challenge from a Republican, and predicted he’d wipe the floor with whatever outsider tries to infiltrate his party. "Not to say that that person doesn’t have a chance, but they’re going to be running as a Republican in the Libertarian primary," Mr. Johnson said in a Monday interview at The Wall Street Journal’s Washington bureau. "I think they get shoveled out the door. But, you know, it would be great to have somebody really high profile show up and run for the Libertarian nomination. That would be terrific.
