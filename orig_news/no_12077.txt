Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he will have "many women involved" in his administration. [Trump’s comment comes after a Huffington Post report quoted Trump’s top aide Paul Manafort saying Trump won’t pick a vice presidential candidate who is a woman or a minority because "that would be viewed as pandering, I think. "  "It’s likely that we would have somebody," but not for any "specific reason," Trump clarified to reporters on Thursday at a press conference in Bismarck, North Dakota. He added that he suspects having "many women involved. " Trump was critical of the Huffington Post, questioning whether it covers politics and adding that Manafort was misquoted.
