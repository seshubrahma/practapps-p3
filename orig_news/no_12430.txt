Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones, a Republican who is challenging Rep. Ami Bera ( ) renounced his support for Donald Trump on Saturday, and said that his defection from the GOP nominee "may cost me the election. "[In an interview with the Sacramento Bee‘s editorial board on Monday, Jones said some in his inner circle advised him against the move, and predicted that it was "going to be horrible" for him. However, Jones said, "I think at the end of the day the best advice I received is ‘You have to do what’s right for you,’ meaning me, and that’s exactly what I did. "  Jones issued a statement on Saturday explaining why he felt he needed to abandon his party’s nominee. He said: "Mr. Trump’s comments that were disclosed yesterday discuss conduct which is at best disgusting, and at worst criminal. I can no longer explain to my daughters why I am voting for Mr. Trump. As such, I will be voting for neither candidate for president. " Jones added, "There are ardent Donald Trump supporters that will likely fall off, or choose not to vote," noting, "It will cost me votes," though how many votes it costs "will remain to be seen. " After months of supporting Trump, Scott Jones’ latest statement is too little too late. On Election Day, either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be elected president. If Scott Jones was truly committed to keeping Donald Trump from the White House he’d pledge to support Clinton and call on Trump to quit.
