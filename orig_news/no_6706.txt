Author Neil Howe, who along with William Strauss wrote "Generations," "The Fourth Turning" and "Millennials Rising," explains how his ideas have inspired former Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon’s (or, for those who wish to maximize their SEO, Steve Bannon) worldview. [Writing in the Washington Post:  The headlines this month have been alarming. "Steve Bannon’s obsession with a dark theory of history should be worrisome" (Business Insider). "Steve Bannon Believes The Apocalypse Is Coming And War Is Inevitable" (the Huffington Post). "Steve Bannon Wants To Start World War III" (the Nation). A common thread in these media reports is that President Trump’s chief strategist is an avid reader and that the book that most inspires his worldview is "The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy. " I wrote that book with William Strauss back in 1997. It is true that Bannon is enthralled by it. In 2010, he released a documentary, "Generation Zero," that is structured around our theory that history in America (and by extension, most other modern societies) unfolds in a recurring cycle of    eras. While this cycle does include a time of civic and political crisis  —   a Fourth Turning, in our parlance  —   the reporting on the book has been absurdly apocalyptic. I don’t know Bannon well. I have worked with him on several film projects, including "Generation Zero," over the years. I’ve been impressed by his cultural savvy. His politics, while unusual, never struck me as offensive. I was surprised when he took over the leadership of Breitbart and promoted the views espoused on that site. Like many people, I first learned about the   (a   movement with links to Breitbart and a loosely defined   agenda) from the mainstream media. Strauss, who died in 2007, and I never told Bannon what to say or think. But we did perhaps provide him with an insight  —   that populism, nationalism and   authoritarianism would soon be on the rise, not just in America but around the world. Because we never attempted to write a political manifesto, we were surprised by the book’s popularity among certain crusaders on both the left and the right. When "The Fourth Turning" came out, our biggest partisan fans were Democrats, who saw in our description of an emerging "Millennial generation" (a term we coined) the sort of   optimists who would pull America toward progressive ideals. Yet we’ve also had conservative fans, who were drawn to another lesson: that the new era would probably see the successful joining of   economics with   social values. Beyond ideology, I think there’s another reason for the rising interest in our book. We reject the deep premise of modern Western historians that social time is either linear (continuous progress or decline) or chaotic (too complex to reveal any direction). Instead we adopt the insight of nearly all traditional societies: that social time is a recurring cycle in which events become meaningful only to the extent that they are what philosopher Mircea Eliade calls "reenactments. " In cyclical space, once you strip away the extraneous accidents and technology, you are left with only a limited number of social moods, which tend to recur in a fixed order.
