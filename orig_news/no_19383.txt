He also said Amazon is getting away with "murder" because Bezos is using The Washington Post’’s influence to keep politicians away from taxing the company properly.’ "It’s unclear what actions Trump would take to prove his case, but it’s not hard to see him threatening to put more pressure on Bezos and Amazon by asking the IRS to increase its scrutiny." ’Bezos "bought this paper for practically nothing, and he’’s using that as a tool for political power, against me and against other people, and I’’ll tell you what, we can’’t let him get away with it," Trump said in an interview with Fox News in May.’ ’Amazon paid $273 million in income taxes in 2015. The company historically has had very little profit and only about $14 billion in cash, a small amount compared with other companies of its size.’ ’On the other hand, if anything,  could help Amazon.

But Amazon is all about offering low prices and putting customers first in its business. Amazon also owns a 15% share of total US retail and a 20% share in    —   hardly anywhere near a monopoly.’ "Amazon could raise prices in the future, but its history suggests that’s unlikely.
