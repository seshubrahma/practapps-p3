[About 100 people affiliated with The Peopleâ€™s Lobby, a radical   group with a manifesto that calls Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton "mainstream Democrats," filled the lobby briefly before being ushered back outside where they stayed for about an hour.

"These kinds of bullying tactics are nothing new from the radical progressive left, but it wonâ€™t deter Heritage or our hundreds of thousands of members across America from fighting for a balanced budget that improves the lives of all Americans," Denton told Breitbart News. "If the protestors truly opposed the   they would support Heritageâ€™s Blueprint for Balance which calls for an end to corporate welfare and ending wasteful Washington spending on failed programs. " The Heritage 2018 budget blueprint is summarized in the report: The Peopleâ€™s Lobby website reveals a much different vision for this countryâ€™s future: The Peopleâ€™s Lobby is a     organization devoted to organizing widespread support for public policies and candidates  â€”   including people from our communities  â€”   that put the needs of people and the planet before the interests of big corporations and the very rich. We train leaders to build bases in our communities, organize elected officials and other powerful people to put the interests of people and the planet first. The Peopleâ€™s Lobbyâ€™s Center for Progressive Strategy and Researchâ€™s lengthy manifesto says, in part: "There is a silent progressive majority to the left of both the Tea Party and mainstream Democrats like Clinton and Obama, and it is ready to be transformed into a populist progressive movement in electoral politics. Such a movement would capture a much larger base than that of the Tea Party, and it would be much more powerful. We must seize this opportunity by building indecent political organizations capable of electing movement progressives to office.
