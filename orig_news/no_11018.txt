TEL AVIV  —   Here are the five most important aspects of Donald Trump’s speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, on Monday. [1  —   Trump said he will "dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. "  My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. I have been in business a long time. I know   and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic  —   for America, for Israel, and for the whole Middle East. However, he stopped short of pledging to immediately nix the international nuclear accord signed in Vienna last year. He stated at AIPAC that "at the very least, we must hold Iran accountable by restructuring the terms of the previous deal. " Channelling the sentiments of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said Iran should suffer immediate consequences for likely violating U. N. Security Council resolution 2231 by conducting a series of ballistic missile tests in recent days. Netanyahu last week called for Western powers to take "immediate punitive steps" against Iran for the missile tests. Trump stated: The deal is silent on test missiles but those tests DO violate UN Security Council Resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it. Which brings me to my next point  —   the utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. 2  —   Trump declared he will check Iran’s growing regional dominance. The GOP frontrunner affirmed that as president he will "stand up to Iran’s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. " He outlined Iran’s support for terrorism worldwide, from Syria to the Gaza Strip to Lebanon and beyond. "They’ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home," he said. "Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach. " This policy of countering Iran’s regional influence stands in stark contrast to President Obama’s own coddling of Iran, and the president’s orientation away from America’s traditional Sunni Arab allies. 3  —   Trump said he opposes the United Nations unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state. An agreement imposed by the UN would be a total and complete disaster. The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto. Why? Because that’s not how you make a deal. Deals are made when parties come to the table and negotiate. Each side must give up something it values in exchange for something it requires. A deal that imposes conditions on Israel and the Palestinian Authority will do nothing to bring peace. It will only further delegitimize Israel and it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they are stabbing Israelis  —   and even Americans. He further threatened to veto "any attempt by the UN to impose its will on the Jewish state. " 4  —   Trump vowed to move the U. S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem  —   and we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the state of Israel. 5  —   Trump will treat Israel like an ally and not a "  citizen. " When I become President, the days of treating Israel like a   citizen will end on Day One. I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and we will be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region. While this declaration may sound simplistic, it comes after seven years of Obama espousing policies some have argued are hostile to the Jewish state. And it comes on the heels of a turbulent relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, including a notorious May 2010 White House meeting in which Obama reportedly snubbed Netanyahu for dinner with Michelle and his daughters.  Also, the Obama administration faced accusations it encouraged the activism of nongovernmental organizations working to defeat Netanyahu in the 2015 elections in Israel.
