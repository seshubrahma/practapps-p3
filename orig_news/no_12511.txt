It’s not that complicated, folks. In 2008, Obama was aligned with his party’s base against the Iraq War and brought in new black voters who felt the party’s establishment had taken them for granted. In 2016, Rubio was not aligned with his party’s base on amnesty while Trump, who is, is bringing in   voters who believe the GOP has been taking them from granted. John Edwards’s "Silence is Betrayal" speech at Riverside Church didn’t help Clinton either during the 2008 election cycle. This ain’t rocket science. ] 6:10: Cook Political Report: Upcoming Calendar Favorable to Trump: The upcoming calendar is favorable to Trump. The south and Midwest have all pretty much weighed in at this point. Cruz didn’t do as well in the south as he should have. Kasich didn’t do as well in the Midwest as he should have. Now, it’s now time for the west and northeast to have their say. On the one hand, the blue states up in   (New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania) should favor the more establishment candidacy of Kasich. In 2012, Romney easily defeated Rick Santorum in these states. However, Trump has a regional appeal that makes him uniquely positioned for these states. And, despite early predictions that closed primaries, as most of these northeastern states will be, would hinder Trump, he’s managed to win in both open and closed contests. It’s easy to see how Trump carries not just New York, but also Rhode Island, Delaware, and even Connecticut. Moreover, Trump continues to win among ‘somewhat conservative’ Republicans, the group of voters that have proven to be the most predictive of winning the nomination. Of the 20 states that have voted  —   and have exit poll data  —   Trump has carried the ‘somewhat conservative vote in 16 of them, including wins last night in Illinois, Florida, North Carolina and Missouri. Trump’s immigration stance will help him in Arizona on March 22, a winner take all state with 58 delegates. And, we should expect him to do well in   areas of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Washington state. Moreover, the map isn’t all that favorable to Cruz. Not only are the northeastern states a cultural mismatch for Cruz, there are also few remaining caucuses left on the calendar. Caucuses, with their more socially conservative constituency and emphasis on grassroots organizing, have been great for the Cruz campaign. Of the 21 states that vote between now and June 7, however, only four hold caucuses. Cruz is the only candidate with the money and the expertise to compete in the arcane congressional level delegate fights in delegate rich states like California and New York. That may be enough to fracture the vote enough to prevent Trump from getting the total number of delegates he needs, though it might not prevent a Trump "win" in the state.   6:02: The Americans returns tonight and is adopting Trump’s slogan to promote its heralded program: Making #TheAmericans Great, Again! @Vulture celebrates its return with interviews, review of the new season,  more. https:  .   —   The Americans (@TheAmericansFX) March 15, 2016,  5:58: Coulter: NEW COLUMN IS POSTED!

After checking the game tape, so to speak, it turns out that the reader was talking about Kayleigh McEnany’s appearance on Tuesday’s edition of Wolf. When asked if Palin’s endorsement benefited Trump, she said that "it plays into the image of Donald Trump being for everyday Americans. Sarah Palin may not speak like an Ivy League professor in the most flourished rhetoric we would like but she is real and authentic and she resonates with voters because of that. " Her comments were more refreshing because, as Blitzer pointed out, McEnany went to Harvard. Take it from me, it takes someone who has been in elite   circles to 1) be secure, 2) not need to be accepted by them, and 3) see the ridiculousness of those cultures, especially how they look down on "outsiders" like Palin. McEnany, who is also an ardent Trump supporter, is a breath of fresh air on CNN. So is Jeffrey Lord. Almost everyone else from the "right" that CNN has on is either a hack who speaks    gobbledygook or just      to regular Americans. Yawn. They have "political professional" stamped all over them and desperately seem like they want nothing more than the adulation of their MSM "bettors. " McEnany obviously isn’t one of them. The types of people inside the Beltway who reflexively hate Palin have a few things in common: 1) they are usually miserable,   people who are unhappy with their lives 2) if they don’t have Ivy League pedigrees or have not been in elite social circles, they desperately crave to be in that "crowd" and see bashing Palin as their ticket to get in those circles 3) if they have Ivy League pedigrees or have been in elite social circles, they are snotty elitists against whom Americans are revolting 4) they were probably dweebs growing up and are trying to   their childhoods in D. C. by trying to turn D. C. into "Hollywood for ugly people. " More importantly, though, they don’t realize how counterproductive it is to mock Palin for not speaking the King’s English. Is it any surprise the same idiots who mocked Palin ridiculed Trump’s syntax? And is it any surprise how gloriously it backfired? In what may be one of the most important articles written about this election cycle,   Gobry wrote in The Week: As many critics gleefully point out, Trump is not very good with the English language. He certainly doesn’t speak like someone you would think of as a presidential candidate. It’s not just his Northeastern accent. He occasionally screws up with spelling and grammar. Trump gets mocked a lot for this. Especially on Twitter, and especially by people like me  —     members of the media elite. On Friday morning, Trump misspelled "honor" and "lightweight" on Twitter. The high priests of Manhattan media were almost beside themselves with delight. So let me say this in a way you elites can understand: As David Foster Wallace explains in a brilliant essay on English usage, there isn’t just one "English. " As elite liberals are apt to understand in other contexts, what we call Standard English is really just one dialect of English  —   the English of rich, educated, largely white English speakers. There are many other dialects in English, associated with different regions, ethnicities, classes, and so on. Trump speaks the language of his voters  —   unlike other presidential candidates, and unlike people who go on TV to be professional pundits. And what does Trump tell these voters? That the elite are against them. That they despise them. And what do elites do? Prove Trump right by sneering at a Trump trait that he shares with many of his voters. Trump and his voters don’t speak Standard English, nor do they speak its cousin dialect, Politically Correct English. As Mother Jones’ Kevin Drum points out, many people dislike political correctness, not because they secretly harbor bigoted views, or because they have a principled belief in a culture of free inquiry, but simply because Politically Correct English is a foreign dialect, which changes frequently and unpredictably. And if you don’t always master its nuances, you might suffer withering social opprobrium. (You’re not exactly sure what gender to refer to Caitlyn Jenner as? You bigot!) As the French thinker Pierre Bourdieu pointed out many decades ago, such systems of etiquette often function as ways for the ruling class to control the ruled, enforce class privilege, and keep the ladder to the upper class nice and slippery. And this particular form of social control only seems to be exercised against one type of person. Trump connects with the white working class, with the socially downtrodden, with the frustrated and despairing, and with the poorly educated and financially struggling not in spite of his   manner of speaking, but because of it. The wealthy, urban elite ought to remember that before they turn Trump’s misspellings into a cocktail party punch line. It’s worth nothing that Rubio’s campaign went in the toilet as soon as he started mocking Donald Trump’s spelling errors on Twitter.] 4:42: Van Jones concedes Trump can beat Hillary Clinton on CNN. 4:40: We have the Clinton campaign right where we want them: Sanders campaign manager says that they are "essentially" where they "expected to be" at this point in the race.  —   Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) March 16, 2016,  4:30: Maybe they will join the 500 members of the GOP Smart Set to start a third party that will do as well as the No Labels movement (but at least the incompetent Smart Set consultants will get paid for another election cycle —  and that’s all that matters to them) : Where will Marco Rubio’s Silicon Valley support turn? https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) March 16, 2016,  4:17: Michael Jordan?

Quarterbacking and captaining the Buffalo Bills (  town) and San Diego Chargers (diverse region) allowed him to genuinely connect with   Americans and those living in, in Kemp’s words, the ghettos and the barrios. Ryan, meanwhile, is a creature of the Beltway and sounds more like a career political staffer than an inspirational politician. His pitches seem   for Kemp’s dreaded "boardroom.

We cannot afford to lose the Supreme Court for generations to come by nominating or confirming someone that a dealmaker like Donald Trump would support.

GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT CALLS ON REPUBLICANS TO COME TOGETHER, I’m asking all Republicans today to come together and begin preparing to win the general election in November. With his victories yesterday, I believe it is now time for Republicans to accept and respect the will of the voters and coalesce behind Donald Trump. This has been a hard fought primary, with an outstanding roster of excellent candidates, including two of Florida’s favorite sons, and several Republican Governors who are close friends of mine. But the voters are speaking clearly  —   they want a businessman outsider who will dramatically shake up the status quo in Washington. When I first ran for Governor the political class and party leaders opposed me with great vigor, and some even said if I won the primary they would never vote for me. But the voters had other ideas, and they are the only ones who count. Here’s what really matters  —   we have to elect a Republican in the fall in order to grow jobs, rebuild our military, and put a person who respects the Constitution on the Supreme Court. This is the stuff that truly matters. If we spend another four months tearing each other apart, we will damage our ability to win in November. It’s time for an end to the Republican on Republican violence. It’s time for us to begin coming together, we’ve had a vigorous primary, now let’s get serious about winning in November.
