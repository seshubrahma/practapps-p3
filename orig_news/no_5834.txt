During Politico’s "Off Message" podcast discussing his book "The Vanishing American Adult,"   Sen. Ben Sasse ( ) said President Donald Trump "comes out of a reality TV world,"  which gives him "lots of anxiety about whether or not that kind of world is really what we want for our kids. "  Sasse said of Trump, "The president has had kind of three careers en route to becoming president. I think of them as three 10 —    careers. He had real estate where he was really successful.

Then he had a bunch of operating companies for 10 or 15 years I guess, casinos and operating companies —  most of those failed. And then he had the career that really launched him into the presidency, which is celebrity reality TV. He continued, "And let’s be clear —  the guy is a marketing genius. He recognized far before Politico and other media outlets recognized, you are going to have a disintermediation of media channels. The barriers to entry were going down.

And I have lots of anxiety about whether or not that kind of world is really what we want for our kids. " (  Politico) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
