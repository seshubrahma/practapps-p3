Older, African American women: I think we found two in the country who voted for us in the South. We’re really getting decimated. But here are the facts, and check ’em out: All over the country among younger people  —   African American younger people, 30 or under, Latino younger people  —   we’re doing much better. Latino younger people, we’re now winning, I believe. So I would attribute this to number one, the popularity of Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton with, you know, it’s a brand name. They’ve been known by the African American community for 25 years, uh, and they are popular. Number two, he was, Clinton was the governor of Arkansas in the South, right? They have roots in the South. But I think once you get out of the South, you will find we are doing better with the African American community and much better with the Latino community. 5:53: Cruz in Green Bay: A Good Friday fish fry with the Cruz fam in Green Bay, WI pic. twitter.   —   Betsy Klein (@betsy_klein) March 25, 2016,  5:51: Bird lands on Sanders’s podium: Bird lands on podium during @BernieSanders campaign event  —   @abcpolitics https:  .   —   ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) March 25, 2016,  "That bird is really a dove asking us for world peace!"  @BernieSanders to wild cheers as a bird lands on his podium pic. twitter.   —   Danny Freeman (@DannyEFreeman) March 25, 2016,  5:49: David Dewhurst (Cruz defeated him in the 2012 Texas GOP Senate primary) endorses Cruz: David Dewhurst Endorses Ted Cruz, a Former Foe, for President. @PatrickSvitek reports: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Texas Tribune (@TexasTribune) March 25, 2016,  5:39: Enquirer denies Trump involvement.

Trump’s slide is being driven by women as the percentage of Americans with an unfavorable opinion of him continues to rise. And pollsters believe the violence at his rallies  —   not to mention his ongoing misogynistic rhetoric  —   may be scaring off Republican and independent female voters. "There’s a possibility that the violence at the rallies has cut into his overall popularity," said Quinnipiac University Assistant Polling Director Tim Malloy. Malloy’s recent survey found that 64% of voters believe Trump is very or somewhat responsible for the ongoing violence at his rallies. Just 26% of women had a favorable view of him in that survey, with 67% viewing him unfavorably. 11:28: Everything’s a lot more geographically focused with only one state voting in the next two weeks: . @JohnKasich will be campaigning in West Salem, Madison and Milwaukee next week: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   TODAY’S TMJ4 (@tmj4) March 25, 2016,  11:24: The GOP must win. . @EWErickson says Kasich should get out of the race so the GOP can defeat Trump. https:  .   —   Clare Foran (@ckmarie) March 25, 2016,  11:11: Three new TV ads hit Cruz’s YouTube account. . @TedCruz’s campaign uploads three new ads: https:  .  https:  .  https:  .   —   Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) March 25, 2016,
