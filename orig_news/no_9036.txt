"  Khan said, "This person is total incapable of empathy. I want his family to counsel him, teach him some empathy. He will be a better person if he could become  —   but he is a black soul. And this is totally unfit for the leadership of this beautiful country, the love and affection that we have received affirms that our beliefs, our experience in this country had been correct and positive. The world is receiving us like we have never seen. They have seen the blackness of his character, of his soul, that he is void of recognizing, empathizing with people.
