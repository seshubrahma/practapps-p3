 (CNN) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump got a bump in odds to win the presidency after the Republican National Convention, according to CNN’s Political Prediction Market. Before the convention, Trump’s odds for the White House were at 29%. After the convention, he bumped up to 40%. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, whose odds were at 71% before the convention, her chances trickle down to 61% by Tuesday. The Democrats’ convention this week could cause their odds to change again once Clinton accepts her party’s nomination. The ultimate prediction marketplace for the races and issues that matter most, CNN’s Political Prediction Market is an online game administered by a company called Pivit that functions like an online market and allows Internet users to predict the outcome of the 2016 election. It is not to be confused with polls from real voters. In the latest   poll released Monday, Trump is leading for the race to the White House. In the poll, Trump topped Clinton 44% to 39% in a   matchup including Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson (9%) and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein (3%). In a      matchup, Trump is leading Clinton 48% to 45% respectively. Those percentages represent a   convention bounce for Trump, which are traditionally measured in   matchups. According to CNN’s new electoral college map, Clinton has 236 electoral votes from states that are either solidly or leaning Democrat compared to 191 electoral votes for Trump in states that are solidly or leaning Republican. That leaves 111 electoral votes up for grabs across eight battleground states. Clinton’s electoral college votes could give her an edge in odds for her to win the White House.
