(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The Dallas police chief, David Brown, said a search of the home of the   Army veteran who killed five officers last week turned up    equipment. He said officers around the country were concerned about more reprisals for police shootings, and revealed that he had received a death threat. And he voiced the frustrations of his profession. "Every societal failure, we put it off on the cops to solve," he said, listing the untreated mentally ill, drug problems, failing schools, broken families, even stray dogs. "That’s too much to ask," he said. _____ 2. President Obama was at work on a speech for Tuesday’s memorial in Dallas for the fallen officers. His hopes for a unifying message were clouded by criticism. Black Lives Matter activists want him to go to Minnesota or Louisiana to honor black residents killed by officers, while conservatives blame him for fostering divisions. Former President George W. Bush, a Texas resident, is also speaking at the memorial. _____ 3. "It is the most surprising result of my career. " That’s a Harvard economics professor, pictured above center, with his research team. Their   study confirmed that police officers are more likely to manhandle and   blacks than whites, but not to shoot blacks more often. The finding runs counter to the perception created by   police shootings. _____ 4. Britain’s shift to a new prime minister to navigate the painful exit from the European Union suddenly accelerated. David Cameron, who had expected to step down this fall, told reporters he would cede power on Wednesday to the newly unopposed home secretary, Theresa May, above with her husband. His lapel mike then caught him entering 10 Downing Street singing. _____ 5. Republicans convened to hash out details of their convention platform. There was pushback against some of Donald Trump’s more contentious proposals. Mr. Trump has been guarded in his comments about the Dallas attack and the two police shootings earlier last week. But concerns are rising over the potential for violence at next week’s Republican convention in Cleveland. Ohio laws allow firearms to be openly carried. _____ 6. Have you noticed an increase in distracted walking? Pokémon Go has swept the U. S. and other countries since being released last week. The game uses augmented reality, overlaying digital imagery on the real world. So people are wandering all over the place, waving their phones to find and capture exotic Pokémon monsters. _____ 7. Gabby Douglas, the defending   gymnastics champion from the 2012 Olympics, celebrated her spot on the team headed to Rio after a shaky performance during weekend trials. Now 20, she is one of the older U. S. team members. _____ 8. A review of data on roughly 10, 000 physician faculty members at 24 U. S. medical schools revealed that women’s incomes averaged nearly $20, 000 less a year than male colleagues’. "At the end of the day, it’s not fair," said a female doctor who wrote an editorial to accompany the analysis in the Journal of the American Medical Association. _____ 9. The U. S. will deploy 560 troops to help drive the Islamic State from the city of Mosul, the largest escalation the Obama administration has made in Iraq. Some 5, 000 U. S. troops are now in the country. _____ 10. One of our   stories today: Our reporter’s account of weeks spent in Saudi Arabia trying to understand the conservative Islam practiced there. He found a society in conflict. Witness the tale of a onetime Saudi religious enforcer who, based on research on early Islam, began arguing that there was no need to close shops for prayer, bar women from driving or insist they cover their faces. The result: death threats. _____ 11. Finally, good news. It turns out that two of childhood’s more maligned habits,   and   might actually improve the immune system. And visits to the dentist are getting a lot easier, thanks to a   fluid, silver diamine fluoride, that can replace drilling and filling. One dentist praised it as "better, faster, cheaper" and "less trauma for the kid. " More good news: Adults can use it too. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
