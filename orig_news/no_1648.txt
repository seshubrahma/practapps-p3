The first hurricane to hit Florida in 11 years caused major storm surges and power losses from Tampa to Tallahassee, but only one fatality was reported. Now a weaker tropical storm, Hermine is inundating Georgia and moving into the Carolinas, and a watch is in effect from New Jersey to Rhode Island. Here’s our map of the storm’s path. _____ 2.   companies still wield enormous clout in Washington. The   and cigar industries are deploying an army of some 75 lobbyists to try to keep the Food and Drug Administration from examining their products for public health risks and possibly banning them. The battle comes nearly two decades after tobacco companies paid out $200 billion to compensate the public for health consequences of smoking. _____ 3. Email trouble continued to dog Hillary Clinton’s campaign. The F. B. I. released its July interview with her, along with a summary of the investigation into her use of a private server as secretary of state. Here are six things we learned, including new details of when some of her emails were deleted. _____ 4. Donald Trump shifted from his midweek focus on immigration to reaching out to black voters. He visited Philadelphia on Friday and will visit a church in Detroit on Saturday. The pastor will interview him for a cable show, but it remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump will follow the scripted answers laid out by his advisers. Moderators for the coming presidential debates were announced: Lester Holt of NBC on Sept. 26, Martha Raddatz of ABC and Anderson Cooper of CNN on Oct. 9, and Chris Wallace of Fox News on Oct. 19. _____ 5. President Obama is heading to China for his final G20 summit meeting this weekend. He’ll stress his determination to overcome congressional opposition to the   Partnership trade accord.

On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of Catholics are expected as Pope Francis leads a service elevating Mother Teresa to sainthood. The nun, who served the sick and dying in Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, died 19 years ago. Here is a timeline of her life. Her work lives on, but her legacy is not without critics. _____ 7. Here’s a roundup of sports entertainment for the long weekend. There’s tons of tennis at the U. S. Open (ESPN2, the Tennis Channel) but it’s noisier than usual  —   the new retractable roof is wrecking acoustics at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Major League Baseball’s regular season has just a month to go, with the New York Yankees in surprisingly good shape. And college football begins in earnest. Here’s our forecast. _____ 8. Among the films opening this weekend, Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander play an Australian couple who find a baby in the   War I romance "The Light Between Oceans. " And our film experts found seven   indies whose audiences just keep building, including "Southside With You," "Indignation" and "Hunt for the Wilderpeople. " Still hunting? Here’s what’s new for streaming. And our critics found two TV shows, four books and seven viral videos to distract you. _____ 9. Finally, if you happen to be in Midland, Tex. you can join in the Summer Mummers, a nearly    tradition. On Friday and Saturday nights, thousands of people pack into the Yucca Theater to boo a raunchy, corny stage show  —   and fling popcorn at the performers and one another. Popcorn sales for the season? An estimated $110, 000. Have a great weekend.  _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
