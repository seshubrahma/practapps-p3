 (CNN) This weekend, we asked our mobile audience if you believe James Comey’s Thursday testimony to the Senate intelligence committee.  The fired FBI director added fuel to the fires surrounding his private interactions with President Donald Trump, the FBI’s Russia investigation, his handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe and his own dismissal.  Out of more than 300, 000 votes, 90. 6% said they believe the former FBI director’s testimony is trustworthy, while 9. 4% do not.  Thanks for weighing in.
