’  ’ ’     This past Thursday, an eternity in Trump time, Jake Tapper     began his daily CNN show The Lead by     addressing Donald Trump’s untermensch Steve Bannon’s recent     comments that the media ought to "keep its mouth shut. " With     disdain in his eyes and a sneering smile on his face, Tapper     succinctly responded, "" —  a no swiftly shared around social     media.   ’ ’     Jake Tapper, CNN’s chief Washington correspondent, has been a     journalist for nearly 20 years, during which time he has earned     a reputation as a   newsman and       tough interviewer. But he has only started going viral     recently. Tapper become the host of The     Lead and CNN’s Sunday morning news     show State of the Nation without parroting     the most popular anchor modes of our time, the righteously or     satirically partisan talking head. Unlike Bill O’Reilly, Megyn     Kelly, Sean Hannity, Rachel Maddow, Chris Hayes, or even CNN’s     rising star Van Jones —  whose show, The Messy     Truth, is now  —  Tapper     has built his brand on a kind of performative neutrality: an       news anchor refashioned for the present day.   ’ ’     While there are certainly people,  who     reflexively scoff at the notion of CNN’s nonpartisanship, it is     still the only cable news network with  that     voted for Trump or for Hillary Clinton. Channeling the ethos of     his network, Tapper is combative less about party than the     "truth. " A notorious bulldog for answers, he methodically     rephrases questions over and over again until he gets, or     doesn’t get, a response, as when he asked Trump if his comments     on Judge Gonzalo Curiel were racist —  . Tapper has     moderated Republican debates and made himself as irksome to     Clinton as to Trump,  the former     with queries about her foundation and the latter     about .     In a 2014 profile for Politico,     Tapper  himself as     "besieging [the Obama White House] with calls and complaints     and accusations and whatever. " In the leaked Podesta emails,     Podesta wondered, "Why is Jake Tapper such a dick?" Tapper     responded to this dig   in response:     "It’s a question that has confounded millions of people for     hundreds of years. "   ’ ’     A dogged reporter, a   kind of a dick: This is a     pretty accurate distillation of the Tapper brand, one     cultivated over years of unsparing interviews and pugnacious     tweets. Evidence of Tapper’s style can be found even back in     his Washington City Paper cover story about     going  in which he mixes a small amount of       —  he’s just another hack who wants a part of the     Lewinsky story —  with extreme confidence in his own judgment —  she     was a little too breezy, but at least, unlike many other women,     she asked questions —  to come to a morally magnanimous     conclusion: Monica deserves better. It makes a good case for     Tapper being both a little bit of a smarm and also     fundamentally decent.   ’ ’     This persona made him an asset to CNN: the "reasonable"     journalist on the hunt for bullshit wherever it lived, proof of     CNN’s seriousness of purpose, even as his        and kept him from overtly decrying the more     insidious recalcitrance and obstructionism of the Republican     Party. But since Trump’s election, Tapper’s fiery but       objectivity has morphed into a kind of     radicalism, as the establishment, or at least the president,     cuts ties with the truth. At a moment in which believing in     "facts" is a partisan stance, Tapper has become an occasional     liberal hero and poster boy, in a nonpartisan patterned tie, of     the resistance.   ’ ’     To maintain his air of authority, Tapper doesn’t just     tenaciously question politicians or assess Trump’s actions; he     calls out Democratic hypocrisy whenever he can. It’s like     tossing a wet blanket on liberal adoration that only makes that     adoration smolder further: The guy really has integrity! In a     recent roundtable he shut down Democratic talking heads for     comparing Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s nominee for the Office of     Management and Budget who  to Tom     Daschle, whose nomination to the Obama Cabinet was scuttled by     the same charges: Tapper pointed out that Democrats had pulled     Daschle’s nomination themselves, so it wasn’t analogous. He     made a show of defending Kellyanne Conway on     Twitter,  it     should be said, saying that "either the truth matters or it     doesn’t" —  the white knight stampeding into battle perhaps less     on behalf of Conway herself than on behalf of his own ideals     and image.   ’ ’     Faced with a   who lies as a matter of course,     Tapper has turned to the hypocrisies of the Trump     administration, the most pressing ones at hand. Just this past     Sunday, he pressured Republican Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, who was     already lightly criticizing the recent executive order on     immigration, to get more concrete. "Not to be hysterical, but     this is a matter of life and death," Tapper said, excusing     himself for not moving on to other topics. A sensible "not to     be hysterical" followed by "matter of life and death" —  it was     the perfect Tapperism, a cri de     coeur dressed up with enough calm   to     make it land all the more persuasively.   ’ ’     There are plenty of cable news anchors currently on the air who     have spent years pioneering ways to disguise spinelessness as     impartiality. But Tapper legitimately doesn’t shy away from a     fight. This past week The Lead included a     segment that could have been straight out of The Daily     Show, but for the restrained delivery:  blaming the media for calling the Muslim ban a     ban, and then proceeding to, himself, call it a ban. This is     why the New York Times media critic sees him     as a paragon of ". "     It’s why Trevor Noah’s The Daily     Show awarded Tapper with a "" for not     getting spun by Conway. It’s why his tweets and clips are     getting passed around social media attached to hyperbolic words     such     as destroy and eviscerate.   ’ ’     Tapper’s smugness —  that resolute faith in his own judgment, that     earnest sense of himself as unerring adjudicator and master     bullshit detector —  is a fundamental part of his vibe and     sometimes his appeal. Tapper’s confidence is a not altogether     uncharming element of his confrontational style (see that "no"     to Bannon) though it can wear thin. His recent contretemps     with BuzzFeed over that website’s decision     to share the specific contents of the "golden shower" memo, a     story CNN first broke, is another example of Tapper calling out     a hypocrisy and, in so doing, missing the forest to yell at     another tree. Tapper defended Trump     from BuzzFeed, saying, "The president has a right     to be mad," as though what mattered was Tapper’s infallible     sense of right and wrong and not the larger picture. Tapper     framed the stories as though they were in opposition to each     other when they were actually mutually reinforcing,     with BuzzFeed’s elevating CNN’s above a kind of       blind item. Tapper recast a genuinely thorny     question of journalistic ethics as simplistic, supporting the     bully who yells "fake news" and perpetuating a paradigm of     "good media" and "bad media" to indemnify his institution from     a president who  out anyway.   ’ ’     "CNN is in the business of sussing out what is true and what is     false,"  aligning himself     and CNN with virtuous journalism     and BuzzFeed with lowly muckraking. For     those who see all of the press as the "opposition party,"     there’s not a lot of daylight in this distinction. Edward R.     Murrow himself would be dismissed by Trumpies as a partisan     hack disseminating fake news. But Tapper’s overconfidence in     the distinction is exactly why he’s found his moment: The idea     of facts is so under siege that any bravado on their behalf,     even misguided bravado, is palpably reassuring. When you’re     watching Jake Tapper, the truth is still something you can feel     smug about.   ’ ’This past Thursday, an eternity in Trump time. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
