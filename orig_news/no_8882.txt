Milo Yiannopoulos’s next big move. [From The Hollywood Reporter:  Milo Yiannopoulos has parlayed his ban from Twitter   —   and some controversial appearances on college campuses and cable TV shows  —   into a $250, 000 book deal with Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon  Schuster, The Hollywood Reporter learned on Thursday. "They said banning me from Twitter would finish me off. Just as I predicted, the opposite has happened," Yiannopoulos told THR, confirming the upcoming book without commenting on financial details. "Did it hurt Madonna being banned from MTV in the 1990s? Did all that negative press hurt Donald Trump’s chances of winning the election?"   …     "I met with top execs at Simon  Schuster earlier in the year and spent half an hour trying to shock them with lewd jokes and outrageous opinions. I thought they were going to have me escorted from the building  —   but instead they offered me a wheelbarrow full of money," Yiannopoulos told THR. Read the rest of the story here.
