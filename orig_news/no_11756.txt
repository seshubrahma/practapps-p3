Paul Nehlen told Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow on Tuesday, "Paul Ryan spent 10. 6 million dollars to tear down my platform against trade and against securing the border, and now, where is he standing? He’s trying to stand on the platform that I built to run against him in the Wisconsin primary. "[Nehlen was defeated by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan in his district’s Republican primary this year.  Nehlen and host Marlow went on to discuss Ryan’s seeming rightward shift since   Donald Trump won election on November 8. Nehlen said he thinks Ryan is "mouthing platitudes to try to keep himself in good graces," but he doesn’t believe Ryan is sincere. He added, "Paul Ryan is in it for Paul Ryan. He tore down Donald Trump at every opportunity, and only in the last two days, when it was blatantly apparent that Mr. Trump was going to win, did Paul Ryan try to jump on the Trump train.
