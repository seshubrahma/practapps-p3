"At some point Donald Trump needs to take responsibility for the irresponsible behavior of his campaign. " San Jose, California Mayor Sam Liccardo. [With those words, violence against supporters of Donald Trump and the candidate himself has been justified and in fact encouraged by the Mayor of California’s third largest city, which is the titular capitol of the Silicon Valley.  Trump supporters coming out of a rally, in the city made famous in the 1960s by Dionne Warwick, were attacked, punched, egged and abused while the San Jose police department largely stood and watched, perhaps having gotten word in advance to not intervene on behalf of the   supporters of the presumptive GOP nominee. Some of the largely Hispanic mob of protesters waved signs saying things like, "Trump, this is Mexico. You are not welcome on   soil," demonstrating the extent and reach of the la raza (the race) movement in states such as California. The Mexican reconquista movement is a rejection of American sovereignty over lands that, according to mythology, were formerly held by the Aztecs throughout the southwestern United States. And it is telling that many of the   protesters reject his notion to "make America great again" instead waving Mexican flags while burning the Stars and Stripes. What makes the San Jose situation shocking is the acceptance and almost encouragement of violence against their political opponents, with few arrests made. This almost complete reversal of the civil rights imagery with stooges like Liccardo playing the role of Bull Connor, should stun America. However, given the Obama Justice Department’s political decision to not prosecute the New Black Panther Party members who were swinging a sword around in front of a Philadelphia polling place in 2008, along with DOJs Civil Rights Division’s propensity for throwing gasoline on fires of unrest, this descent into violence is beyond troubling. With promises from far left financier George Soros funded groups to disrupt the Trump campaign with localized violence only in their nascent stages, the ugly face of the angry, intolerant left will soon be revealed to anyone willing to look. The mobs of San Jose and earlier Orange County, CA have made it clear  —   this is their country and there is no place for dissent from the orthodoxy of race politics. America, for its part, will remain more concerned about a dead gorilla in Ohio, than the unraveling of the electoral system and the admission by   protesters that they have not come to America to join the dream, but instead seek to capture land for the nation that they or their families left behind. In cities like San Jose, there will be no police ensuring fair and safe voting for those who disagree, because disagreement is by their own definition racist and intolerable. Should Donald Trump prevail in the upcoming election and be inaugurated President, the very same violent thugs who attack lawful supporters of his now, will demand the very protections under the law that they deny their political opponents today. And they will be afforded their rights, because in America that’s the way we do it. At least until people like the Mayor of San Jose take charge, then the final illusion of freedom will be stripped away as the social fabric of America is torn asunder once and for all. And somehow, it is Donald Trump’s fault, because after all, threatening to enforce the law is an abject threat to those who have been taught to reject its legitimacy.
