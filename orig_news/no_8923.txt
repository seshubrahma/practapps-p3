Thursday in Indianapolis, IN at the Carrier factory he recently announced would be keeping 1, 000 jobs in the United States,   Donald Trump vowed a border wall would be built.  In discussing companies moving jobs out of the country, Trump said, "They will be taxed very heavily at the border if they want to leave, fire all their people, leave, make products in different countries and then think they’ll sell that product over the border. Which by the way, will be a very strong border, very strong border. Believe me. And I think companies  —   we are going to build a wall. People are saying ‘Do you think Trump is going to build the wall? ’" "Trust me, we are going to build a wall," he continued. "We’ll have doors in that wall but they’re going to come through illegally. People are going to come through on worker’s permits to work the fields, a lot of people are going to come through but it is done through a legal process. One thing that’s not coming through are drugs. The drugs are going to stop. The drugs are going to stop. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
