During an interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd for "Meet the Press" on Friday, Representative John Lewis ( ) stated, "I don’t see the   as a legitimate president.   …     I think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians, and others, that helped him get elected. "  When asked if he planned to build a relationship with   Donald Trump, Lewis answered that he believes in forgiveness and trying to work with people, but that "it’s going to be very difficult. I don’t see the   as a legitimate president. " He added, "I think the Russians participated in having this man get elected, and they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. I don’t plan to attend the Inauguration.   …     I think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians, and others, that helped him get elected. That’s not right. That’s not fair. That’s not the open, democratic process. " (  Caitlin  ) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
