The Morning News reported that a wife of a legal immigrant, Brooke Wang of nearby Plano, Texas, said she was there to show support for the president. "We are just for legal immigration   â€¦     We want people to come here legally. " Wangâ€™s husband is a legal permanent resident who emigrated from China. She sported a "2016 Trump for President"   and was carrying an assault weapon. Wang and others at the march took the opportunity to not only support the president and his immigration policies, but to exercise their constitutional right to carry arms. The march in Dallas followed protests at schools in the city, and in Austin, Texas, and the #DayWithoutImmigrants.  Thereâ€™s a #protest at #Dallas #TX in my school. #AntiTrump pic. twitter.   â€”   ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸Nick WildeðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ (@9NickPWilde9) February 17, 2017,  As reported by Breitbart Texasâ€™ Bob Price: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials are continuing to defend themselves against the national media which continues to mischaracterize the role and intent of the   of criminal aliens. Media reports have called the Operation Cross Check arrests of criminal aliens a   effort by ICE officials and the Trump Administration, despite the fact that this operation has been carried out in the past. More than 2, 000 criminal aliens were rounded up in March 2015, Breitbart Texas reported at the time. The nearly 700 arrests in last weekâ€™s operation pales in comparison, yet the mainstream media appears to have lost total perspective in its attacks on the men and women tasked to protect our nation from these criminals. As reported by Breitbart News, the #DayWithoutImmigrants was "a political dud" however, some who decided to skip work, including those who did not show up in order to protest were fired.
