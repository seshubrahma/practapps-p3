It’s pretty common. In fact, New York’s Daily News ran this front page earlier this week: ‘Trump Is Hitler.’  O’Brien added: "It doesn’t get much worse than ‘Trump Is Hitler,’ so I asked if he would come out tonight to address these comparisons. Shockingly   …     He agreed. " Silverman then entered dressed as Hitler. "Don’t get me wrong, Conan, I agree with a lot he [Trump] says. A lot, like, 90 percent of what he says, I’m like, ‘This guy gets it,’" she said. "But it’s just   …     I don’t like the way he says it. It’s just   …     it’s crass. " Silverman added: "What kind of person talks about his penis size on national television? I’m so sure Donald Trump has a big penis. I famously have a micropenis. That’s what makes a tyrant. " The liberal comedian and Sen. Bernie Sanders supporter then said, "Sometimes I watch him and I’m like, ‘is that how people see me? ’"   …     I have to be honest: Trump, he’s starting to make me rethink some of the things I’ve done.
