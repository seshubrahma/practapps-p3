Monday in an appearance to promote his new memoir "The Long Game" on "CBS This Morning," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) addressed the possibility that some in the Republican Party will buck the party to go with a presidential candidate other than the party’s presumptive nominee Donald Trump.  McConnell described doing as "disrespectful" of the party’s electorate and said he would be a better choice than the Democratic option, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. "Let me put it this way," McConnell said. "We know what we get with Hillary Clinton  —   four more years just like the last eight. We know the average American is $3, 000 a year worse off now than they were when President Obama came to office. The country is yearning for a change. And my view is four more years like the last eight is not good for the country. He won the nomination fair and square. He went out there and competed like everybody else. He got the most votes. And I think it’s disrespectful of the Republican electorate to say, ‘I’m smarter than you are, and I’m not going to support your choice. ’" Later in the segment, McConnell urged Trump to take a different approach than his usual   speeches. "I’d like to see a more studious approach," McConnell added. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
