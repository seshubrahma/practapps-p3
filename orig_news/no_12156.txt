Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has unveiled his very own Snapchat filter for tonight’s first presidential debate, which refers to his debate partner Hillary Clinton as "Crooked Hillary. "[ The filter, which places a frame around video content, displays the words "Debate Day, Donald J. Trump vs Hillary Clinton," and is accompanied by fireworks as well as Trump’s campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again. "  It has been praised as a smart move from the Trump campaign, who seek to broaden his appeal to millennials, by creating specialised content for Snapchat, a platform generally used by younger people. Snapchat filters have previously been used by the Clinton campaign, specifically designed to target Trump voters by using a quote of his previously suggesting that Clinton would make a great president. The first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton takes place September 26 at 9pm Eastern.
