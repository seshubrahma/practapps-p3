Ted Cruz challenged Donald Trump on his view of Planned Parenthood during the GOP debate in South Carolina. [Cruz charged that Trump supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood.  "Where did I support it?" Trump asked repeatedly. "You supported it when we were battling over defunding Planned Parenthood," Cruz said in return. Trump said Cruz’s statements were "a lot of lies. " "You said, ‘Planned Parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it,’" Cruz pointed out. "It does do wonderful things but not as it relates to abortion," Trump asserted. "Excuse me. Excuse me, there are wonderful things having to do with women’s health  …    But not when it comes to abortion. " As Breitbart News reported last August, Trump said that Planned Parenthood should no longer receive taxpayer funding if the group continues to perform abortions. He continued: While Planned Parenthood is engaging in the despicable practice of abortion  —   in addition to then selling aborted baby body parts to the highest bidder  —   the organization should receive no taxpayer dollars. The liberal left wing always claims that Planned Parenthood isn’t about abortion and that it’s about other general areas of women’s health. I am totally in favor of women’s health and if they can put their money where their mouth is, and stop the abortion services at Planned Parenthood entirely, we can talk about government funding for many of the other aspects of the organization that do a lot of good. "The problem that I have with Planned Parenthood is the abortion situation. It is like an abortion factory, frankly," Trump also said in a CNN interview. "And you can’t have it. And you just shouldn’t be funding it. That should not be funded by the government, and I feel strongly about that. " OO. ready( function()  ) })
