This week on "Fox News Sunday," when asked if the presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump asked him to be his vice presidential running mate, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said he would be "  not to say yes. "  Partial transcript as follows: WALLACE: All right. Finally, Mr. Speaker, and you knew this was coming, there has been a lot of speculation  —   Don’t give me that laugh  —   about you running  —   GINGRICH: I thought you were above this. WALLACE: No, I’m not above it. This is what I do for a living. And I know you didn’t think I was above it. There is a lot of speculation that he is going to ask you to be his running mate. Now, if he asks you, you’re certainly going to say yes. GINGRICH: Well, if he asks me, I’m certainly going to say I want to sit down and talk about it. I don’t think it’s an automatic yes, I think you have to think through what does he think the job involves. WALLACE: And if he indicates, as I’m sure he would, you’re going to play a big role  —   GINGRICH: If he can convince Calista and me that it’s doable and that it’s serious and we would, in fact, contribute I think we would be very hard pressed not to say yes. WALLACE: Would you like to do it? GINGRICH: I don’t know. It’s certainly a great challenge, but as you know I have a pretty interesting exciting life, we’re premiering a new movie on Washington, in Mount Vernon, on Friday night. We have a new book coming out "Rediscovering God in America" this week. So, we’re pretty busy, but we could probably be  —   we could be lured into a new path. WALLACE: I was going to say you could take the vice presidency and the House isn’t bad, either.  Mr. Speaker, always a pleasure to talk with you. GINGRICH: Good to be with you, Chris.
