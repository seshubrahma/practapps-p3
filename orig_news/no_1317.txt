Updated, 10:04 a. m. Good morning on this phenomenal Monday. For the first time in decades, the New York presidential primaries will be consequential to both the Democratic and the Republican nominations. "If you have a legitimate chance of victory, this is really your    time," David Birdsell, dean of the Baruch College School of Public Affairs, said of the candidates. So we’ve heard them debate our values, weigh into local politics and barnstorm our public spaces with booming speeches. It’s all to connect with New York’s diverse voters. "You’ve got liberal pockets, conservative pockets, upstate, downstate and the city," Mr. Birdsell said. "That keeps the conversation alive  . " It’s crunchtime. Our primaries come late in the voting calendar. And we’re a   state, with 95 Republican and 291 Democratic delegates up for grabs. Donald J. Trump, for one, is looking for a big win here to avoid a contested convention and push past a troubling few weeks for his campaign. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio are also fighting, particularly to peel away as many delegates as possible from Mr. Trump. And a big win in New York could help Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont fight for another day for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton. Especially if you’re part of a crucial voting bloc, New York City could shape the outcome. The fun starts Tuesday.

F. K. Newark Take a long stroll in Manhattan, and you may walk past a building that an American president once called home. During the city’s brief reign as the nation’s capital, George Washington and his family lived at 3 Cherry Street in Lower Manhattan. In Kips Bay, a townhouse at 123 Lexington Avenue was the home of Chester A. Arthur and where he took the oath of office in 1881. A few blocks south, a townhouse at 28 East 20th Street (now a replica) was the childhood home of Theodore Roosevelt, the only president born in New York City. And among the others, an apartment at 142 West 109th Street in Morningside Heights was where President Obama lived when he was a junior at Columbia University. It was even available for rent in 2010. At the time the landlord did not charge a presidential premium. New York Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a. m. till late morning. You can receive it via email.
