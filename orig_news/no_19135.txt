’  ’ ’   Donald Trump appears to be shrinking his deficit with Hillary   Clinton in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, according   to a poll of likely voters in the state released Sunday. ’ ’   The poll,  found the former   secretary of state leading the Republican presidential   nominee by 3 points in a    matchup, a   drop   from a similar survey conducted a week ago.  ’ "   Clinton still has a more significant lead in the state’s   aggregate. According to the RealClearPolitics average of   recent reputable polls, Clinton has a   lead over   Trump. " "   The Clinton campaign has focused much of its time and resources   on Pennsylvania, a state whose 20 electoral votes are   crucial to either candidate’s path to securing the 270   electoral votes needed to win the White House. " ’   In the last several weeks, Clinton has deployed top surrogates to   the state, including President Barack Obama and first   lady Michelle Obama, populist firebrand Sens. Elizabeth   Warren and Bernie Sanders, and popular business leaders like   billionaire investor Mark Cuban. ’ ’’ ’   Recent polls show the race tightening in several other key   battleground states and nationally. A Washington Post  of national voters found the candidates   in a virtual dead heat heading into their first debate Monday   night at Hofstra University. ’ ’   And a slew of Fox News  released late last week found the   magnate   Nevada, North Carolina, and Ohio. After weeks of large Clinton   leads, the RealClearPolitics average of each state now shows   Trump with a slight edge in each state. ’
