Washington (CNN) Bill and Hillary Clinton continued their tradition of honoring US service members by walking in Mondayâ€™s Memorial Day parade in Chappaqua, New York. "A rainy but wonderful morning march in the Chappaqua Memorial Day Parade," Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, tweeted Monday. "Thinking of our veterans who gave their lives for this country." "It is a good way to remember our veterans and particularly those who gave their lives or were grievously injured," Clinton told CNN at the parade in 2015. "This is a way of demonstrating that they are not forgotten and we are going to continue doing everything we can to make sure we honor their sacrifice and commitment." The couple has tried to walk the New Castle Memorial Day Parade every year since they moved to the Norman   New York hamlet in 1999. President Donald Trump on Monday also honored the US service members who made the ultimate sacrifice by visiting Arlington National Cemetery. He was joined by Vice President Mike Pence, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Joseph Dunford and Secretary of Defense James Mattis.
