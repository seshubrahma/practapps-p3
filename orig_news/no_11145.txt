From Gabriel Sherman writing at New York magazine:  Tonight, Donald Trump’s   war with Fox News entered a chaotic and  —   for both sides  —   perilous new phase when Trump called Roger Ailes’s bluff and announced he was boycotting Fox’s debate to protest Megyn Kelly’s aggressive coverage of his campaign. Instead, Trump said he would host his own Iowa town hall to raise money for veterans and let other networks cover it. One clear sign of the gravity of tonight’s development is the sense of confusion that is swirling throughout Fox. The network is split between Kelly’s allies like Brit Hume and conservative anchors that are furious that Kelly  —   who graces the cover of Vanity Fair this month  —   has become the face of the network. An anchor fumed that Kelly hosted Michael Moore on her program tonight and the lefty filmmaker defended her against Trump. "That would be like Rachel Maddow laughing along with Charles Koch as he trashed Hillary Clinton!" the anchor said. One producer speculated that Fox could go "National Review" on Trump and start attacking him. Read the rest of the story at New York magazine.
