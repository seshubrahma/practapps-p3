The chairman of the Media Fairness Caucus slammed the   bias at mainstream news outlets, especially after the election of   Donald J. Trump, Wednesday from the House floor. ["We need a new word for the dictionary, a new term for the merger of the liberal media and the Democratic Party," said Rep. Lamar Smith (R. ) who is also the chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.  "Obviously, the liberal media have no intention of treating   Trump objectively or fairly," the chairman said. "They want to continue to link arms with the Democrats," he said. "This is no surprise given that 96 percent of national reporters’ contributions went to Hillary Clinton," he said. As chairman of the Media Fairness Caucus, here’s my proposal. Let’s combine the two words ‘media’ and ‘Democrat’ and go with ‘mediacrat.’ It’s short it gives the media first mention and it sounds like a new species. " Smith is a former federal prosecutor and also served as the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. "Now, I realize the liberal media is not likely to use this word "mediacrat" very often. But there are two reasons for them to do so. First, to show they have a sense of humor. And second, to show they have a sense of humility," he said. "I think most Americans would be happy if the liberal media didn’t display their bias every time they covered the " Smith said. "Maybe the mediacrats should try balanced reporting. It surely would help their credibility," he said.
