Brooks (@CornellWBrooks) January 4, 2017,  Brooks said Senator Sessions’s "disregard for voter suppression" and his support of "the myth of voter fraud" are among the reasons the civil rights organization publicly opposes his nomination as attorney general. A Selma,   Army veteran, Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump’s candidacy. The   tapped the former U. S. attorney to serve as attorney general in November. The NAACP   Tuesday coincided with the publication of an open letter signed by a group of 1, 226 law professors opposing Sessions’s nomination. "In 1986, the   Senate Judiciary Committee, in a bipartisan vote, rejected President Ronald Reagan’s nomination of  . S. Attorney Sessions for a federal judgeship, due to statements Sessions had made that reflected prejudice against African Americans," the letter says. "Nothing in Senator Sessions’ public life since 1986 has convinced us that he is a different man than the    attorney who was deemed too racially insensitive to be a federal district court judge. " Senator Sessions has vehemently denied the allegations, as Breitbart News investigative reporter Julia Hahn notes, citing his record of supporting civil rights initiatives in Alabama and his efforts to bankrupt and dismantle the the Ku Klux Klan in the state through civil litigation.
