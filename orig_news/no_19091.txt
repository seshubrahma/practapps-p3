’   President Barack Obama took  to rake members of the media   over the coals for coverage of Donald Trump. ’ ’   Obama, speaking at a Philadelphia rally for Hillary Clinton, said   he was "frustrated with how this campaign is covered." ’ ’   "I’’m just telling the truth. Guys in the back, I’’m just telling   you the truth about how I feel about this," the president said,   speaking directly to the members of the media toward the back of   the rally. ’ ’   Obama then asked the crowd: "Do you mind if I just vent for a   second?" ’ ’ ’ ’   "You know, you don’’t grade the presidency on a curve," he said.   "This is serious business." ’ ’’ ’   Obama contended that Clinton and Trump were starkly different on   a number of issues. ’ ’   "You want to debate who is more fit to be our president?" he   asked. "One candidate has traveled to more countries than any   secretary of state ever has, has more qualifications than pretty   much anyone who has ever run for this job, and the other, who   isn’’t fit in any way, shape, or form to represent this country   abroad and be   ." ’ ’   "And Donald Trump says stuff every day that used to be considered   as disqualifying for being president," Obama continued. "And yet   because he says it over and over and over again, the press just   gives up, and they just say, ’’Well, yeah. OK! ’’" ’ ’   The president added: "They just  —   ’’I was opposed to the war in   Iraq. ’’ Well, actually he wasn’’t. But they just accept it!" ’ ’   Obama was likely referencing a moment in which NBC News anchor   Matt Lauer  that he was against the   Iraq war at the outset. ’ ’   "The bottom line is that we cannot afford to suddenly treat this   like a reality show," Obama said. "We can’’t afford to act as if   there is some equivalence here. To be president, you have to do   your homework, and you have to know what you’’re talking about." ’
