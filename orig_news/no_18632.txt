’Republican presidential candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) performed better than expected in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.’ ’With about   of precincts reporting, Kasich is standing in second place behind declared primary winner Donald Trump. He had about 15% of the vote.’ ’Fox News, NBC, and ABC have all projected that Kasich will finish in second.’ ’The Ohio governor  —   a moderate outsider who has been competing with New Jersey Gov.
