Necessary: ‘Can’t Stump the Trump’ Takes a Victory Lap[Welcome to Breitbart News’s live coverage of the aftermath of Election Day, 2016. Check this page for updates on   Donald Trump, celebrating a shocking upset win, and the reactions from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the bipartisan political establishment, and legacy media outlets.  All times Eastern. 7:13 PM  —   Mexican newspaper not taking this too well. Via elgrafico. mx: 6:58 PM  —   "Can’t Stump the Trump" is an amateur YouTube channel where an anonymous college student mashed up news clips with 4chan memes to cheer on   Donald Trump, starting in the Republican primary  —   while simultaneously documenting his insane,    political ascent from an Alt Right perspective. It’s crudely assembled, it’s vulgar, and it’s become an online campaign tradition as infamous as Matt Drudge’s debate polls.  "Comrade Stump," as he calls himself on Twitter, created several memes that stuck for Trump’s fan base. By making a dubstep song, "Centipede" by Knife Party, the theme song to the series, a nature documentary voiceover sampled in the prelude inspired Trump supporters to call themselves "centipedes" and "nimble navigators" and crack jokes about Trump being a "predator" with "hollow fangs. " Several other running jokes include air horns blaring after every Trump putdown or unfortunate event for his opponents, a video game sprite animation delivering a "kill shot" on defeated foes, and overlaying the faces of political players on   movie clips such as Star Wars: Episode III’s climactic lightsaber fight. On the night of Trump’s epic victory, CSTT uploaded a teaser video ("Volume 29. 5: THE MADMAN DID IT") to sate his fans until a proper   for the series. Watch it below: 6:35 PM  —   In 1987, Nixon wrote Trump regarding a television appearance his wife, former First Lady Pat Nixon, greatly enjoyed. Trump had agreed to a profile on the popular show Donahue, airing in December of that year.  "As you can imagine, she is an expert on politics and she predicts that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner!" the short letter read.  The letter became public as part of the release of a Donald Trump biography titled Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success. It would take nearly three decades for Trump to decide to run for office, proving the 37th president correct. On Tuesday, Donald Trump became   of the United States, sweeping Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in reliably blue states like Michigan and Wisconsin. As Republican nominee, Nixon won the 1968 largely on the back of a campaign targeting   Americans who felt the Kennedy and Johnson administrations had allowed the government to descend into chaos, particularly in the context of the rudderless Vietnam war. These voters he dubbed the "Silent Majority" in a 1969 speech. Trump’s campaign echoed many of the sentiments of that election, down to using the term to refer to those whose livelihoods were threatened or eliminated entirely by the growing global economy. Below, Trump’s Donahue appearance that impressed the Nixons: 6:33 PM  —   Bernie: "Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick of establishment economics, establishment politics, and the establishment media.

"  Wikileaks revealed that she pitched ad campaign scripts to Hillary Clinton’s inner circle, and echoed the Democratic candidate’s attacks on Pepe the Frog. Mensch and Heat Street also showed strong support for Evan McMullin, the independent conservative candidate who tried to spoil Trump’s chances in Utah.  However, after the results had come in, Mensch began to break down. An archive of her account from around 9AM UTC shows tweets of her claiming that an "FBI coup" pushed Trump into office, even though he was a "racist, Russian spy. " Her bio now reads "Stumped by Trump. " Jack Hadfield is a student at the University of Warwick and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech.

Richard Trumka: "More than anything, this election is an indictment of politics as usual."  —   Alex   (@aseitzwald) November 9, 2016,  1:27 PM  —   Trump won states such as Pennsylvania and Iowa that had twice backed Barack Obama.  Exit polls and unofficial returns reflect deep racial, gender, economic and cultural divides across the region and nationally. Trump’s support Tuesday skewed older, more male and overwhelmingly white. His supporters said they are deeply dissatisfied with the federal government and eager for change. That’s according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for national media outlets. Democrat Hillary Clinton’s support was anchored in cities, but it wasn’t enough to overcome Trump’s advantages in small towns, rural areas and many suburbs. 1:07 PM  —    12:45 PM  —   With only New Hampshire left to be called, Clinton has turned in the Democratic Party’s worst Electoral College performance in 28 years pic. twitter.   —   Dan O’Donnell (@DanODradio) November 9, 2016,  12:42 PM  —   Egyptian president congratulates Trump.

Back in September, Gallup presented the findings of an important research project that, in retrospect, ought to have prompted a lot more soul searching among members of the press. What they did was, over an extended period of time, survey people and ask them what they were hearing about the two candidates. The answer is that with regard to Hillary Clinton, they heard a lot about email. With regard to Trump, they heard about nothing in particular.
