’  ’ ’   A federal appeals court unanimously ruled against President   Donald Trump on Thursday, refusing to reinstate his travel   ban affecting people from seven   countries. ’ ’   The ruling, issued by a   panel on the San     9th Circuit Court of Appeals, means that refugees   and citizens of the countries in question can continue entering   the US. ’ ’   "We hold that the Government has not shown a likelihood of   success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that   failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury, and we   therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay," the panel said   in its ruling. ’ ’   Shortly after the ruling was announced, Trump posted a defiant   message to Twitter: ’ ’   "SEE YOU IN COURT," Trump tweeted, foreshadowing a legal   challenge that could play out in the Supreme Court. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! ’t’t’ "   The Justice Department said it is reviewing the court’s decision. " ’   The ruling comes after a   judge in   Seattle, James Robart, issued a nationwide hold on the ban   on Friday, prompting the US Justice Department to file an   emergency stay. ’ ’   The executive order, signed by Trump on Jan. 27, halted all   admissions of refugees into the US, as well as immigration from   seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya,   and Yemen. Its hasty rollout caused chaos at airports   nationwide, leaving some refugees and   stranded for   hours. ’ ’ This story is developing.
