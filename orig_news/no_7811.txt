Hillary Clinton lit into Donald Trump for expressing a negative view of America’s condition Tuesday, while talking to reporters about the previous night’s presidential debate on her campaign jet.[  A reporter in Clinton’s traveling pool asked about Trump declaring that he had restrained himself from bringing up personal scandals involving former President Bill Clinton. The Democratic presidential nominee responded with a pithy dismissal and abruptly shifted into a monologue on her bright vision for the country’s future. As I say, he can run his campaign however he chooses. And I will continue to talk about what I want to do for the American people. Lay out specific plans with very clear goals in mind to help us deal with all the challenges we face. I’m excited about where we are in this country. He talks down America every chance he gets. He calls us names he calls us a   country he talks in such dire and dark terms. That’s not who America is. We are the best   in the world our diversity is a strength. I am excited about helping to pull our country together to set some big goals on infrastructure and advanced manufacturing and clean energy to take on climate change  —   which, by the way, is not a hoax made up by the Chinese  —   and do everything that I’ve talked about. And you should know by now, when I set my mind on something, I keep going. I don’t quit. Whatever the static  —   whatever the incoming is  —   and that’s what I’ll do for the American people. And I’m looking forward to it.
