Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos appeared on Sky News today to debate whether Donald Trump would be a good choice for US President, telling presenter Kay Burley that Trump would make America "fabulous again. "[Yiannopoulos debated Kate Andrews from the ASI, who was more sceptical about whether Trump is presidential material.  Andrews and Burley suggested that Trump had a problem with "hurtful" statements about women and minorities but Yiannopoulos pointed out that Trump is polling strongly with blacks, Hispanics and women.  "Is he a misogynistic racist?" asked Burley. "Of course not," responded Yiannopoulos, who went on to say: "You can’t stump the Trump. He’ll make America fabulous again.
