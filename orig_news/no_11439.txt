On Friday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s "Special Report," columnist Charles Krauthamer argued that Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s loss was because "she had nothing to say. She was running because it was her turn. "  Krauthammer said, [relevant remarks begin around 7:30] "Well, look, every time liberals lose, they accuse the other side of all kinds of isms. That’s been going on for 50 years, and at a certain point, they run out of steam. You can argue that, yes, there were times when Trump might have allowed sort of going beyond the bounds of what was  —   what is tolerable in political speech, but to attribute the loss to racism or an appeal to white supremacy, I think is ridiculous. She didn’t even show up in Wisconsin. She lost Wisconsin.   …     And in the end, the reason she lost is she had nothing to say. She was running because it was her turn. There was no way  —   remember from one of the internal messages that were leaked on WikiLeaks, someone said, what is our message? This is from inside the campaign. So, I mean, she would like to blame it on the basket of deplorables. I don’t think that that’s going to hold up. Yes, you can launch a criticism of some of the things that were happening on the edges of the campaign, but it does not account for the outcome. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
