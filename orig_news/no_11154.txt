Twitter has revealed it will ban anyone from its platform should they violate any of their rules, including the account of   Donald Trump. [When asked by Slate if they would ever consider suspending Donald Trump’s account, the company said, "The Twitter Rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct, and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies. "  Specifically on the subject of Donald Trump, Twitter confirmed that "the Twitter Rules apply to all accounts, including verified accounts. " The announcement comes at the end of a year where Twitter has waged open war against conservative media, consistently banning accounts that make fun of progressive politics or whose users openly support Donald Trump, including that of Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos. Twitter’s position appears to differ from that of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who rejected calls from employees to ban Donald Trump from the platform following his comments about introducing a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to America. Zuckerberg said that he believed Trump’s comments did constitute hate speech, but said the "implications of removing them were too drastic.
