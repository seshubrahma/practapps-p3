’  ’ ’     On Tuesday morning, Donald Trump named Exxon Mobil CEO Rex     Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state. Five days     before that, the   tapped a  Oklahoma     attorney general to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.     Trump has also reportedly settled on a  Montana congressman to run his Interior     Department and a  former Texas     governor to head up his Energy Department.   ’ "     It is a dark time for the future of our planet. It’s tempting     to see the selection of Tillerson —  a man who says publicly that     manmade global warming is indeed a real concern for the     world —  as a bright spot in that darkness. "Can a career oil man     help save the planet?" . Compared to     his fellow Cabinet appointees, "it’s possible that Tillerson     would be a moderating voice," . "Tillerson’s     position on climate change may be to the left of     Trump’s," . All three of those reports couched     their   ’   assessments     in relative terms, which is necessary considering that the       is soon to become the .   " ’     In the bleak lineup of   denialists who are about to take     hold of our government, Tillerson has been painted as a     possible, if unlikely, savior. He is not. There is no     reason to be optimistic that Tillerson, a career employee of     the world’s largest private oil company, will make the incoming     Trump administration any more likely to address greenhouse gas     emissions. None. Zero. Zilch.   ’ ’     The climate case for Tillerson is built on the perception that     the    has softened the oil giant’s       hostility toward the accepted science that shows     humans’ role in global warming. Notably, Tillerson has also     voiced support for a federal carbon tax in the United States     and for the Paris climate agreement that was negotiated last     year. "At Exxon Mobil," he said in a speech earlier this year,     "we share the view that the risks of climate change are serious     and warrant thoughtful action. "   ’ ’     Sure, it sounds good —  it’s practically a relief amidst the     horror. But it’s a mistake to judge Tillerson only by his     words. For one,  in great detail, his more specific     comments on the topic tend to raise doubt about the science     when there isn’t any. More telling, though, have been his     actions.   ’ ’     In the   that Tillerson has been chairman and CEO of     Exxon Mobil, the company has funneled roughly $7. 25 million to     federal candidates via its political action committee,     according to a . The vast majority of that cash —  more     than $6. 5 million —  went to Republicans, and not just any old     Republicans. Recipients of Exxon checks include such         as: Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, the     chairman of the powerful Environment and Public Works Committee     who authored a climate change —  denying book titled The     Greatest Hoax and once brought a snowball onto the     Senate floor to try to make his case that the world had not     warmed; Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, who against the odds     actually once  James Inhofe during a     climate vote two years ago; and Texas Rep. Joe Barton, the     former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, who has     cited a biblical flood as evidence against manmade climate     change (and once infamously apologized to the chairman of BP     during congressional hearings on the Deepwater Horizon oil     spill).   ’ ’  ’ ’     Tillerson may be striking a more   tone in     public than his predecessor did, but the company’s PAC     expenditures suggest it’s little more than the political     posturing of a man eager to present his company as a good     corporate citizen to investors. During each of the six campaign     cycles during which Tillerson has been CEO, Republican     candidates have received roughly $9 out of every $10 spent by     the   PAC, roughly the same share they had been     under the man Tillerson replaced, Lee Raymond (who     memorably  the Kyoto     Protocol that was a predecessor to the U. N. climate deal struck     in Paris). Total political spending by Exxon’s PAC, meanwhile,     has soared under Tillerson’s watch from less than $900, 000 in     2004, the last full cycle under Raymond’s reign, to more than     twice that in each of the past three election cycles. If     Tillerson actually feels at odds with the Republicans he will     soon join in the Cabinet, there is no evidence of this in his     financial decisions.   ’ ’     Hillary Clinton,  was herself no stranger to     donations from the    industry. According to the     Center for Responsive Politics, industry employees gave her     campaign  during     the last cycle, roughly $100, 000 more than they sent to Trump     (but still about a   less than they gave to Sen. Ted     Cruz). The Democratic nominee was a particular favorite of     Exxon Mobil employees, too: They gave Clinton more (about     $80, 000 total) than they did to any other presidential     candidate. That money, however, came from individuals, not the     oil giant’s wealthy PAC, which has avoided donating directly to     presidential candidates in recent years. Tillerson, however,     displayed no such restraint. He sent his own check     to  a man who managed     to offer up a multipronged energy proposal on the     stump .   ’ ’     Exxon’s GOP leanings are, of course, not an accident.     As  the company decides which     lawmakers receive donations —  and which do     not —  based specifically on how they vote on     legislation that Exxon believes will most affect its bottom     line. "We are a   [PAC]," an executive involved     in political strategy told Coll at the time. "Now, when you     apply that litmus, our [PAC] is rightly criticized —  that we tend     to give more money to Republicans than to Democrats —  but it is a     result of the approach we take, and not a desired result. " Put     another way, Exxon Mobil doesn’t donate to Republicans because     they are Republicans; it donates to Republicans because     Republican priorities match their business priorities. There is     no ambiguity in the Republican Party line when it comes to     climate: The  adopted at the 2016 GOP convention, for     instance, states unequivocally that "environmental extremists"     are working to "sustain the illusion of an environmental     crisis. "   ’ ’     Denying climate change directly benefits Exxon’s business     model.  has shown that     even while Exxon was publicly denying the reality of climate     change in the 1990s, they were factoring the melting rates of     Arctic ice into their oil exploration plans. An open Arctic is     profitable for them.   ’ ’     It is certainly possible, even likely, that Tillerson     understands the threat climate change poses. His company was     one of the first to do extensive research on climate change, as     another . Of course, rather than share this     research with the public, Exxon continued to deny climate     change publicly for decades, because it was more profitable for     them to do so. Again, it seems that Tillerson and Exxon     continuously favor pragmatism and profitability over morality.     That is perhaps acceptable, if despicable, when you are running     a private business. But it is an abhorrent quality for a public     servant.   ’ ’  ’ ’     And what of the carbon tax that Tillerson claims to want so     badly? As the  has documented, time and time again,       lawmakers in both the  and the Senate     have actively worked to derail any progress on such a     greenhouse   mechanism, which is seen by many     environmentalists and economists as the best way to put a price     on carbon given its relative simplicity. Tillerson’s support     for such a tax appears even more empty when you remember back     to when he first proposed it: in 2009, when Democrats     controlled both chambers and the President Obama —  backed        bill had not yet died a slow death in the Senate.     Tillerson’s backing would have been a potential       event if it had come back in the 1990s when Al Gore was     advocating for it and when Republicans had not yet closed their     eyes and ears to the science. Instead, Tillerson could comfort     himself knowing that his suggestion had no chance of overcoming     a GOP filibuster in the Senate anytime in the foreseeable     future, no small thanks to those lawmakers his company helped     put there.   ’ ’     Even more troubling than the money Exxon Mobil continues to     funnel to political candidates openly promising to stop the     action Tillerson claims to want, is all the cash the company     continues to send to those groups that traffic in the     disinformation those very same politicians wrongly cite as     evidence for their denial. Under Tillerson, for instance, Exxon     Mobil continues to donate to several groups with     a  about climate science by spreading     misinformation and publishing misleading policy analyses,     including the likes of the American Legislative Exchange     Council and the American Enterprise Institute. The company     suggested to shareholders  that such     practices would stop. Clearly, they have not followed suit.   ’ ’     Maybe it’s preferable that our prospective secretary of state     seems at least able to provide lip service to the idea that     climate change is real. But the actions he has taken as CEO     suggest that, if confirmed next year, he’s far more likely to     say the right thing about climate as secretary, while doing the     wrong one.   ’
