Sunday on NBC’s "Meet The Press," while discussing banning Muslims form certain territories, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump doubled down on a claim he had made a week earlier in an interview with CBS’s "60 Minutes" with his   pick Gov. Mike Pence ( ) which was the Constitution was "great," but it didn’t "necessarily give us the right to commit suicide. "  Trump said, "I don’t think so. I actually don’t think it’s a pull back in fact, you could say it’s an expansion. I’m looking now at territories. People were so upset when I used the word Muslim. Remember this. I’m OK with that because I’m talking territory instead of Muslim. But just remember this, our Constitution is great, but it doesn’t necessarily give us the right to commit suicide, OK? We have a religious, everybody wants to be protected, and that’s great and that’s a wonderful part of our Constitution. I view it differently. Why are we committing suicide? Why are we doing that? I live with our Constitution. I love our Constitution. I cherish our Constitution. We’re making it territorial. We have nations and will come out with a number of the places and it’s very complex.
