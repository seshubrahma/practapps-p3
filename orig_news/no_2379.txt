(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. He has a Pulitzer, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and Grammy, Academy and Golden Globe Awards. He was inducted into the Rock  Roll Hall of Fame decades ago. And now, Bob Dylan adds a Nobel Prize to that list. The    songwriter and musician was honored in the  literature category, a distinction that set off intense debate on social media. Our music critic had one question: "What took them so long?" ____ 2. Donald Trump counterattacked after several women came forward with accounts of his sexual aggression, singling out The Times for publishing what he called "false smears. " Here’s what our lawyer had to say about that. Hillary Clinton will be off the campaign trail for days, letting the furor over Mr. Trump play out in a race tilting in her favor. Michelle Obama, the first lady, sharply criticized Mr. Trump in a speech, saying in a voice that shook with emotion that his lewd comments about women were "disgraceful" and "intolerable. " ____ 3. An American warship fired "limited,  " cruise missiles at Yemen, where Houthi rebels are fighting the   government. The Pentagon said insurgents had fired two missiles at another American warship in the area in recent days. It was the first time the U. S. had become directly involved in the   conflict. ____ 4. The train that smashed through a station in Hoboken, N. J. last month drew attention to a railroad that has been deteriorating in recent years. Despite booming ridership, New Jersey Transit’s finances have suffered during Gov. Chris Christie’s administration. New Jersey Transit hasn’t had a permanent leader for nearly a year, nor a public meeting in months, and it was fined for several violations during a recent audit. Another headache for Mr. Christie: A judge allowed a criminal complaint accusing him of misconduct in the bridge scandal to move forward. ____ 5. The Nigerian government said 21 of the schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram two years ago had been freed. They were among nearly 300 students kidnapped from a school in the town of Chibok, sparking an international campaign using the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. Most of the girls are still missing, believed to be held in remote areas controlled by the militant group. ____ 6. An autopsy requested by the family of Keith Lamont Scott, whose fatal shooting by the police last month prompted days of protests in Charlotte, N. C. showed that he died from gunshot wounds to the back and the abdomen. The county medical examiner’s office has not yet released the results of its own autopsy. Four cameras recorded his death, but none clearly show whether he was holding a gun. We did a    analysis to create a   reconstruction of the moments before and after the shooting. ____ 7. Demand for pastry chefs is soaring, but salaries are stagnant. Our financial columnist says restaurants are simply hiring younger people with less training, a dynamic at work in other U. S. industries, too. Above, Emily Spurlin, at work at a " " restaurant in Chicago’s West Loop. ____ 8. Hyperrealistic video games like the FIFA series and Pro Evolution Soccer are changing the way soccer is played. Many professional players are obsessed with the   versions of their jobs, and use them to study the moves and strategies of famous players. FIFA, world soccer’s governing body, is expected to decide in January whether to expand the World Cup finals from a   tournament to include as many as 48 countries. ____ 9. #thisis2016. Reactions are pouring in after an open letter from a Times editor to the woman who yelled "Go back to China!" at his family on the street. In the video above,   recount their experiences with racism. One man was once asked, "Is your peripheral vision as good as mine, or better? ’Cause, you know, your eyes. " ____ 10. Finally, a reader asked if eating fish is good for us just because it replaces red meat. There are other reasons, like: vitamins A, D and B, a host of minerals and protein that is lean and  . Fish is also low in saturated fat and cholesterol, but high in   fatty acids. Happy eating. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
