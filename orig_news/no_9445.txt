Thursday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," host Joe Scarborough, weighed in on Republican presidential   Donald Trump’s rally in Pensacola, FL, a city of which was in the district that he represented in the U. S. House of Representatives.  Scarborough indicated that it was unprecedented for Pensacola to draw such attendance for a presidential campaign event. "I was at George W. Bush’s campaign rally in 2004 at the final stages of that unbelievable presidential race in early November," Scarborough said. "I saw Reagan come to Pensacola twice in 1980.  I saw the crowds. I never saw anything like that in my hometown before. It’s absolutely staggering, here we are  —   in early January. I’ll be honest with you  —   I guess seeing it in your own hometown, I don’t get it as far as the size of these crowds go. It’s like nothing I saw with Reagan. It’s like nothing I saw with Bush. It’s nothing I saw with any political candidate what I saw come out of Pensacola last night. " Later in the segment, Scarborough said he doubted any of Trump’s opponents could draw a crowd close to that of Trump’s crowd. "I think it’s very safe to say Marco [Rubio] would get 150 people at an event," Scarborough added. "Ted Cruz would probably get double  —   probably get   people at an event.
