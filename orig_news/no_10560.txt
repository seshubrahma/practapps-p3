Dan Gainor, the Media Research Center’s VP of Business and Culture, tells Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon about a recent episode of ABC’s "Quantico" in which a domestic terrorist shouts "Make America great again" before an attack. [Obviously, the slogan has been popularized by the candidacy of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. "They are basically just taking the Trump line, ripping it off and putting it in the mouth of terrorists. That is ABC directly trying to impact the presidential election," said Gainor.  As Gainor pointed out, the show also recently took a shot at Ted Cruz. "One of the characters is talking and she says, ‘I’ve worked with some difficult people in Washington,   Republicans, radical Libertarians, Ted Cruz’ like you know, he’s  so much more extreme than either of those other two groups, he gets his own little category. That’s just another one of the ways they try to influence the election," concluded Gainor. The MRC clip of ABC’s "Quantico" is here: As the Media Research Center’s Erik Soderstrom noted, "Apparently, ‘Make America Great Again’ is the equivalent of ‘Allahu Akbar,’ in Hollywood’s minds. " Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST.
