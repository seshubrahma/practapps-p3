Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) said that his victory in Kansas is the result of "conservatives coming together. "[According to The Hill: "The scream you hear  —   the howl that comes from Washington, D. C.  —   is utter terror at what We the People are doing together," he said during a speech in Idaho. A confident Cruz touted his victory in the first GOP contest called on Saturday. His win in Kansas deals an early blow to Donald Trump as the Texas senator seeks to position himself as the   alternative. "The last couple of weeks have been extraordinary," Cruz said. "Then we saw Super Tuesday  —   results there were extraordinary. Then today, on Super Saturday, we seem to be seeing a continuation of that very same pattern. " "And what we’re seeing is conservatives coming together, what we’re seeing is Republicans coming together   …     what we’re seeing is men and women who love freedom and love the Constitution coming and uniting and standing as one behind this campaign.
