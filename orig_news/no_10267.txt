LAFAYETTE, Louisiana  —   A Muslim student who reported her hijab was pulled from her head and was robbed by   Donald Trump supporters will now face charges for the false claims. [The    college student told police that white men shouting racial slurs at her drove up in a truck and struck her multiple times in the back, while also stealing her hijab and wallet.  Following the accusation, Lafayette police said there were no witnesses or surveillance footage to back up the story. After the New York Times, Times Picayune, Washington Post and Huffington Post all ran with the woman’s claims, Lafayette police said the entire story was fabricated, as Breitbart Texas reported. "During the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males," Lafayette police said in a statement. "This incident is no longer under investigation by the Lafayette Police Department. " Now, the Muslim student is being charged with filing a fake police report, as a Lafayette police spokesman confirmed to  . The police spokesman said the department would not be releasing the woman’s name, despite giving no reason as to why. The spokesman also said he did not have any information on the case. Though the alleged hate crime has now been proven to be a hoax, it has not stopped the story from spreading across the mainstream media. In an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper,   family member Khizr Khan, who was used by the Hillary Clinton campaign to attack Trump on the issue of Islamic terrorism, trotted out the story as fact, referring to it at least once in the course of the segment.
