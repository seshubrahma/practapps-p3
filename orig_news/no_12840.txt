Sunday on NBC’s "Meet The Press," after coming in second place last night in the South Carolina Republican primary, GOP presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) said he feels good about his chances because he argued a large number of Republican voters are seeking an alternative to party   Donald Trump.  Rubio said, "  percent of the people voted yesterday and about 70 percent of Republicans around the country have said we want someone other than Donald Trump to be our nominee. The problem is that vote was still divided even last night among five other people or four other people. I think now the race is narrowing even more. and as it narrows and continues to narrow, we’re going to continue to gain. So it was a very unusual year. You usually don’t have five campaigns operating   in a state this late into the process, three states in. But I feel great that now that the choices have become less and less, more and more that new voter alternative to Donald Trump vote is going to coalesce around us and we have to make the work to make that happen, but we feel good about that.
