Defeated GOP 2012 candidate Mitt Romney is hosting a weekend convention of   ‘  ’ at a secluded Utah retreat to discuss possible " " scenarios. [The "Experts and Enthusiasts Summit"  —   or "E2" summit  —   is at the Stein Eriksen Lodge Deer Valley in Park City, Utah, according to The Washington Post.  The festivities kick off Thursday night. The Republican movers and shakers will reportedly discuss their plot to plant a Trump alternative candidate into the race. The effort has fizzled since Bill Kristol’s pick  —   obscure writer David French  —   decided not to run, and because the Republican National Committee publicly aligned behind Trump after the Indiana primary. But RNC chairman Reince Preibus, who is also joining Trump now in his Twitter exchanges Hillary Clinton, will be at Romney’s "E2" extravaganza, where speeches will be made and symposiums given. The crowd is expected to be only about 300, according to the Post, but it’s apparently an exclusive ticket in #NeverTrump world. The event seems mostly focused on regaining control of the party in the event of a Trump loss, which would no doubt sit well with some of the Establishment attendees, many of whom were participants of the GOP’s defeat in 2008 and 2012. "I am not expecting we will sit by the campfire singing ‘We Shall Overcome’ and "     activist Ana Navarro told The Washington Post. "Mitt Romney and other   leaders can have a big influence on the reconstruction of the   Republican Party. We need to start those conversations now. " According to the Post: John Weaver, another GOP strategist, predicted the Romney gathering will yield no credible solution to Trump. "Some of them will have chardonnay, some will have spring water, they’ll wring their hands, they’ll bemoan the state of the party and then they’ll leave," he said. The E2 summit is not intended to be a political forum, but rather is a   version of the Aspen Ideas Festival. The Salt Lake Tribune also described the pending event.
