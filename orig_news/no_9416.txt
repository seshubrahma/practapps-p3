GOP frontrunner Donald Trump says the news that Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) are colluding in upcoming primaries, aiming to keep him from obtaining the 1, 237 delegates he needs to clinch the GOP nomination actually made him happy. ["I loved it," Trump said, when he heard last night that both the Cruz and Kasich campaigns released statements of their plans.  "It’s collusion," Trump said. "If you collude in business  …    they put you in jail. But in politics, because it’s a rigged system, [  …    ] you’re allowed to collude. " "It shows how weak they are," Trump jabbed during his campaign rally Monday afternoon in Warwick, Rhode Island at the Crowne Plaza Hotel. "It shows how pathetic they are. " Trump referenced taking to Twitter last night when he first responded to hearing about Kasich and Cruz. "Don’t worry, I’ll give it up after I’m president. We won’t tweet anymore. Not presidential," he added. "It takes two guys, long time politicians to try to get together to try to beat Trump and yet they’re way behind," Trump said, adding that’s "pretty bad," calling them insiders and part of the "establishment. " He said the fact that they colluded "shows they are just getting killed. "
