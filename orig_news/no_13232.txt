Welcome to Breitbart News’s daily live updates of the 2016 horse race.[ —    11. 20: Even if Donald Trump wins the GOP nomination, the general election is going to be tough: New @NBCNews poll: 51% of voters "scared" of Trump nomination. @chucktodd joins us now #NBCNightlyNews pic. twitter.   —   NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) February 26, 2016,  10:26: Mexico’s former president is being driven up the wall by Donald Trump, who now says Trump reminds him of Adolf Hitler. New @NBCNews poll: 51% of voters "scared" of Trump nomination. @chucktodd joins us now #NBCNightlyNews pic. twitter.   —   NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) February 26, 2016,  8:00: Trump says, "how about if I don’t do the next debate?" He says he will, though. The next debate is Fox News’  Kelly’s. Trump says the networks should donate some of the proceeds to vets. He also says that because of him, the debates are ridiculous and have become the "Super Bowl of cable television. " Trump says he can recite what everyone is going to say and even jokes that he knows Carson will justifiably complain that he is not getting enough air time.   7:55: After it takes a bit of time for a protester to be removed, Trump says "in the good old days, law enforcement acted a lot quicker. " Trump says he loves the police but "they are afraid to move" because they want to keep their jobs and not lose their pensions. He says "everybody is politically correct" and "our country is going to hell. " He says America is becoming a "frightened country and it’s very, very sad. "   Trump says waterboarding is "just fine" and "if you want to go a step above —  or two or three steps above —  "then that’s fine too. "   7:42: Trump also says Rubio had a "credit card problem" in Florida. This may be the first time Trump has brought up Rubio’s  "credit card problem" after vowing last week that he would hit back at Rubio if Rubio started to attack him. He says Rubio was "taking from the Republican Party" and "having his driveway done and all of this" on the Florida GOP’s credit card. Trump says "the man doing the investigation is furious" because "they are not listening to him" and maybe Trump should interview him. Trump says it will be "embarrassing" if he beats Cruz in Texas and Rubio in Florida. 7:37: Trump says he is   his campaign and blasts Rubio for buying a house for having $178, 000 and selling it to a lobbyists for $389, 000 while he had legislation before him. 7:35: In Oklahoma, Trump blasts "little Marco" for for "sweating" profusely and not being "presidential. " Trump is trying to make the "choker" label stick and stories like this won’t help Rubio: But to those who have known him longest, Rubio’s flustered performance Saturday night fit perfectly with an    strain of his personality, one that his handlers and   have labored for years to keep out of public view. Though generally seen as   and quick on his feet, Rubio is known to friends, allies, and advisers for a kind of incurable anxiousness  —   and an occasional propensity to panic in moments of crisis, both real and imagined. This jittery restlessness has manifested itself throughout Rubio’s life, from high school football games in Miami to   policy fights in Washington  —   and in some ways, it’s been the driving force in his rapid political rise. 6:37: Trump dominant in Super Tuesday states: . @marcorubio: "[@realDonaldTrump’s] been exploiting working Americans for forty years." @BretBaier pic. twitter.   —   Fox News (@FoxNews) February 26, 2016,  6:30: Top Christie backer Ken Langone tells the Wall Street Journal that he thinks Trump will change things for the better as president. Ken Langone, the billionaire Home Depot founder who was Mr. Christie’s top fundraiser, said Mr. Trump would be a great president, even though he personally was backing Ohio Gov. John Kasich. "I think if Trump is going to become president, things are going to change and for the better," he said. "I’m not concerned in the least. For Chrissake, we had eight years of this guy [President Barack Obama]. If I was going to be concerned, I should have been concerned eight years ago. [President George W.] Bush was no prize either. " 6:25: GOP establishment   Fred Malek ‘disappointed’ Christie endorsed Trump: "I have a high regard of Gov. Christie and always thought he was a straight shooter. But I have a sharp difference of opinion with him. I’m disappointed," Malek told Mashable. "It changes the narrative very quickly and suddenly and certainly not in a direction that I think is a good idea.

" Regarding spreading around the video that falsely depicted Rubio mocking the Bible, says he made an "error" and apologized for it. Chuck Todd thinks that Tyler may have been a victim of the "fast news cycle. " Tyler says he’s not "mad about it" and the campaign was "one of the greatest experiences of his life. " He says Cruz is a "remarkably gifted guy" and Tyler loves his family. He says Cruz has a path to victory but that has narrowed. Tyler says Cruz can be the   alternative if Cruz wins two super Tuesday states and Rubio doesn’t win a state. Tyler says Rubio’s campaign will "unravel" if he loses Florida. Tyler says Trump has been succeeding because "he’s taking it to Washington. People are really hurting out there. " He says they are tired of the politicians. Tyler doubts that Trump can change things in Washington but Americans who are tired of politics and have been "hammered" believe he can. 5:15: Maine Gov.

Cruz points out that is an "astonishing statement" to make to millions who have worked at places like TGI Fridays. Cruz says he is the only person who has consistently stood up for working men and women against the corrupt politicians. Cruz says on @CNN that Trump vs. Clinton would be "two rich New York liberals. " I get attacking liberals. Cool! Attacking the rich? What?  —   Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) February 26, 2016,    4:05:  [Tony Lee] Rubio Misfired When He Tried to Attack Trump for His Twitter Typos: For arguably the first time in this campaign cycle, Rubio received live coverage from all the cable networks. And he may have inadvertently blown it. Rubio allies are praising him for ripping Trump this morning and afternoon, but his attacks may backfire on him in three ways. First, nobody cares about typos on Twitter because everybody has made them while Tweeting quickly. Second, Rubio repeated Trump’s criticisms of him —  that he is a lightweight and a choker who melts down —  on national television and it will be replayed over and over again. Guess what? Voters may start to think that he is a choker. At the very least, Rubio ensured that more voters became aware of Trump’s criticisms of him as a "chocker. " All he did was give those criticisms more airtime. Genius. Third, when a politician’s actions do not line up with the image that he has tried to project to voters, he comes across as a phony in an election cycle when voters are craving   "authenticity. " And that’s what happened to Rubio when he implied that foreigners can’t spell while criticizing Trump: So how does this guy, not one tweet, but three tweets misspell words so badly? I only reach two conclusions. Number one, that’s how they spell those words at the Wharton School of Business where he went. Or number two, just like Trump Tower, he must have hired a foreign worker to do his own tweets. Trump can make such comments because he has presented himself to voters as someone who is unapologetic, brash, and politically incorrect. Rubio, on the other hand, can’t because he is presenting himself as Mr. "   Correct" so attacks like that make him seem more like a phony and goes against the core of his brand. Rubio and his allies may be cheering his debate performance and "cute soundbites," but they may not realize he is coming across as "that guy" who desperately hurls insult after insult at the guy who is dating the girl he has always wanted. It’s funny that Rubio’s allies in the permanent   class seem way more like "that guy" than the guy who gets the girl, and that is why they are myopically   each other over Rubio’s performance. The joke may be on Rubio and his "smart set" of "experts" in the end. 4:05: Drudge Report Headline: Trump Campaign Juggernaut:   too. Very significant  .
