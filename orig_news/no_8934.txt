Does presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump regret calling Sen. Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas? [He does.  During an interview with Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, Trump addressed the nickname he used for the Massachusetts senator. "I do regret calling her Pocahontas because I think it’s a tremendous insult to Pocahontas  —   so to Pocahontas I would like to apologize to you," Trump said.  Warren claimed Native American heritage while she was a professor in Harvard  —   even though there is no evidence that she has any connections in her ancestry. Trump referred to Warren as Pocahontas during a press conference in North Dakota, prompting reporters to inform him that it was "very offensive. "
