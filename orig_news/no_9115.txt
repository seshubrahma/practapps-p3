Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has focused a lot of her attention on Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, but she is also turning her attention to Sen. Ted Cruz, now that the Texas Senator has shown new resilience in the Republican primary. ["I think he is a very, you know,   guy," Clinton said during an interview with Politico’s Glenn Thrush. "You can see it from how the Republican Party responds to him. "  Clinton insisted Cruz wasn’t "any better" than controversial "tough guy" Republicans such as Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump. Clinton alluded disapprovingly to Cruz’s hardball tactics, even to fellow candidates in the race. She also expressed concern of the Republican party’s difficulty in selecting a nominee where the two most controversial candidates were left. "It’s, you know, a difficult dilemma that they’re in, trying to figure out what to do," she said.
