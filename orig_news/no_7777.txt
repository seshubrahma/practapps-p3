" "When dangerous and divisive leaders have come to power in the past, it has been in part because those of goodwill failed to speak out for themselves or their fellow citizens," the letter continues. "Some of us come from the groups Trump has attacked. Some of us donâ€™t. But as history has shown, itâ€™s often only a matter of time before the â€˜otherâ€™ becomes me.
