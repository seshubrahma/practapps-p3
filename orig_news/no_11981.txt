Fox News Channel host Greg Gutfeld stated that former Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson’s endorsement of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump shows "even an outsider will sell out" and "I keep wondering, what kind of delicious candy did Donald Trump offer Ben to get him into the Trump van?" on Friday’s broadcast of "The Five. "  Gutfeld said, [relevant remarks begin around 5:45] "Well, I’ve always been a big fan of Carson. But I keep wondering, what kind of delicious candy did Donald Trump offer Ben to get him into the Trump van? That’s kind of a pedophile comparison. Who would do such a thing? Oh, yes, Trump did that with Ben Carson. So, that’s what I find really interesting, is that, we’re in an era now, where you can compare somebody to a child molester, or say that they’re pathologically damaged, and then still get that person’s endorsement. And it tells me that even an outsider will sell out. An outsider also wants to be an insider. He wants to be part of the bandwagon. " He added, "[I]t’s got to be pretty hard to endorse somebody who likened you to a child molester. But the other too is they keep talking about how they  —   Trump and Carson did bury the hatchet. I would be careful using the terminology with Ben Carson. He might take it literally. " Later on, Gutfeld said that former candidate New Jersey Governor Chris Christie "needed a job. " And Carson sees endorsing Trump "as an opportunity. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
