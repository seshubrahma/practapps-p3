Bloomberg was brutal in his critique of Hillary Clinton’s failed bid for the White House. ‘Hillary said, ‘Vote for me because I’m a woman and the other guy’s bad,’" he said. The   former mayor has a long and tumultuous history with the president. Despite Trump’s occasional praise of his fellow NYC billionaire’s time as leader of the Big Apple, things turned ugly after Trump’s presidential campaign kicked off. Bloomberg, nominally an independent, spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, telling the packed arena, "The bottom line is: [Trump] is a risky, reckless, and radical choice, and we can’t afford to make that choice. " Trump was quick to hit back, telling ABC News, "Michael Bloomberg couldn’t get elected as a dog catcher in New York. " Bloomberg, best known outside New York for his steadfast opposition to gun rights, support for taxes on soda, and the   news outlet that bears his name, has not let up on the president since Trump took office. In March, he appeared to defy the president and Congress, saying America will meet the requirements of the Paris climate agreement regardless of what the democratically elected government tries to do.
