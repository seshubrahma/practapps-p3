’  ’ ’   The afternoon after Trump won the presidential   election,  ’ ’  ’ ’   Three weeks later, The Liberal Prepper climbed to 1, 000   members. As of now, it has amassed nearly 2, 000. ’ "   The group is for liberals who, following Trump’s election,   started prepping for " ’   "There was less of a threat of a nuclear holocaust brought out by   Obama," Waugh tells Business Insider.

A few members liked a recent photo of   a liberal prepper’s sink, full of mangoes she plans to   store. " "   Stacy, an   woman who serves as a   of   The Liberal Prepper group, became interested in prepping in the   months leading up to Election Day.
