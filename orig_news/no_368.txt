Putin of Russia and Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who hoped for reassurance that the U. S. would honor the refugee resettlement deal struck with the Obama administration. _____ • Myanmar was shaken by a rare and brazen assassination.

We want to help you stick with it  —   or revamp it into something you really want to achieve  —   so this month Smarter Living will offer tips, advice and motivation to help you. Every Monday in this space we’ll pose a new idea, offer advice for staying strong and ask you a question. Then every Thursday we’ll highlight a few of our favorite emails and offer a helping hand. To join in, email us at smarterliving@nytimes. com with the subject line "My resolution" and send us answers to the following three bullets. And, because this goes both ways, I’ll start us off: • Your name: I’m Tim Herrera, your Smarter Living Editor. • Your resolution and why you chose it (either the one you started with, or the one you really want to achieve): My resolution is to be better with money so I can save more and *gasp* maybe actually retire someday. • Two specific   within your resolution: In February, I’ll order delivery for dinner one fewer night per week, and I’ll stop buying one of my daily afternoon coffees (which I buy solely out of habit, but which cost me around $500 over the course of a year). • An audacious plan to respond to climate change by building a city of floating islands in the South Pacific is moving forward, with the government of French Polynesia agreeing to consider hosting the islands in a tropical lagoon. •  A song spreading fast online in China offers a bit of relief for those who dashed home for the new year only to face relentless personal questions from their families. • And we review "Behemoth," a documentary from Zhao Liang that finds horror and surrealism in Inner Mongolia, where migrant iron and coal workers are shown as cogs in China’s economic progress. Bruce Lee, the first superstar of   films, appeared to Western audiences in only five movies and a handful of TV roles before his early death in 1973. But his influence has never really stopped growing, and his legacy can be found in some remarkable places. Take, for example, the video that Tom Brady, the N. F. L. quarterback, recently posted online to motivate his team for the playoffs. It features Lee’s mantra "Be water, my friend. " Or the impact he had on 1970s reggae music, appearing on album covers, like Lee Perry’s "Kung Fu Meets the Dragon," and inspiring countless songs and artists, such as Dillinger. David Henry Hwang, the   playwright, devoted an entire play to Lee’s life, and called him the first "  male hero. " This week, the Museum of Modern Art in New York is screening all five of Lee’s films in a series called "Eternal Bruce Lee. " He’s been honored in museums from Hong Kong to California, not to mention the Bruce Lee Action Museum in Seattle. Despite all the fanfare, Lee still has an aura of mystery. Did you know he was the 1958   champion of Hong Kong? _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings. What would you like to see here? Contact us at asiabriefing@nytimes. com.
