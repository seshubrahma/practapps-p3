From Bill Gertz writing at The Washington Free Beacon:  China warned the United States on Wednesday not to adopt punitive currency policies that could disrupt U. S.  relations after Donald Trump’s win in the Nevada caucus. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing that "we are following with interest the U. S. presidential election. " Hua was asked about China’s response to a possible Trump presidency and his announced plan to punish China for currency manipulation with a tax on Chinese goods. "Since it belongs to the domestic affair of the U. S. I am not going to make comments on specific remarks by the relevant candidate," she said. "But I want to stress that China and the U. S. as world’s largest developing and developed countries, shoulder major responsibilities in safeguarding world peace, stability and security and driving world development," the spokeswoman added.
