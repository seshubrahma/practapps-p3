During an interview broadcast on Wednesday’s "CNN Newsroom," author, New York Times opinion writer, and Purdue Associate Professor of English Roxane Gay stated she "would have a hard time" talking to a relative who voted for Donald Trump.  Gay said she would talk politics over Thanksgiving, and that she has a Republican brother who, she joked, "voted for Hillary Clinton, thank goodness. So we can speak to him. He won’t be banished. " When asked, "You truly wouldn’t speak to a relative who voted for Trump?" Gay responded, "I mean, it depends. I mean, I think that a vote for Trump is a vote against so much of what I stand for and believe in, that I would have a hard time, but I think it’s very easy to say oh, I’m never going to speak to you again. And in reality, you love who you love. And so, I think a lot of people are going to bridge the distances between them and their family members over the holidays, and, you know, I honestly can’t fault that.
