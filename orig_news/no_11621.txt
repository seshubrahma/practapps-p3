A Marine urged   Donald Trump, Vice   Mike Pence, and General James Mattis to "give ’em hell" while on his deathbed Saturday, saying that it was the greatest honor of his life to fight for them. ["President Trump, Vice President Pence, and General Mattis, I would like to say that the greatest honor of my life has been to wage this battle with you," he said.   "I have been prouder of being a Marine than anything I have ever done. Having a hand in some small way in fighting for my country has meant the world to me.

" "I want each and every one of you to know that we have taken on a challenge that has only just begun. The real battle lies ahead. " "And General Mattis, I have one request, sir, and that is: Give ’em hell," he said, saluting. "Semper Fi. God bless. " Lindsey passed away on his birthday December 17, his family said. Two days before, he had received a call from P. J. Schrantz, Trump’s Chief of Security —  Trump, Pence, and Mattis wanted to know how he was holding up.
