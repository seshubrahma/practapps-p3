"You caught me there for a second. I’m not sure if you’re allowed to say that on television, but you did. " "I won’t be coming back!" Dunham said. "Going out with a bang!" With laughter resounding through the set, Shriver begged Today   Matt Lauer to bail her out. "Matt, help! She just threw me off!" Dunham began to apologize for the bizarre    to which Shriver responded, "That’s okay. That’s the difference between generations. I wasn’t brought up talking like that. " The Golden   actress and   Hillary Clinton supporter recently revealed that the "  pain" of Donald Trump’s election caused her to lose a significant amount of weight.
