WASHINGTON, DC  —   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said he thinks Britain would be better off out of the European Union. His comments come just one day after British Prime Minister David Cameron, who is campaigning for an ‘in’ vote, said he would not apologise to Mr. Trump for calling him "stupid. "[Speaking to Fox News this evening Mr. Trump reflected on the EU and the migration crisis.  He said: "I think the migration has been a horrible thing for Europe. A lot of that was pushed by the EU. I would say that they’re better off without it personally, but I’m not making that as a recommendation  —   just my feeling   …     I would say that they’re better off without it, but I want them to make their own decision". Mr. Trump has previously shied away from involving himself in the Brexit debate despite being dragged into UK politics by parliamentarians and activists who sought to ban him from the country after his assertion that there should be a pause on mass Muslim immigration to the United States. U. S. President Barack Obama waded into the debate last month during a visit to the United Kingdom where he told a press conference with Mr Cameron that it was in America’s interest for Britain to remain in the expanding political union. Mr. Trump all but secured his party’s nomination this week, beating out Ted Cruz and John Kasich in Indiana’s primary, leading the pair to suspend their campaigns. Britain will vote on June 23 on whether to leave the European Union.
