MOSCOW (AFP)  —   Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas has asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to help stop the United States moving its embassy to Jerusalem, a top Palestinian official said Friday. [Saeb Erekat said he had passed on the message from Abbas to Putin during a visit to Moscow during which he met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.  On Friday the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem used his sermon at the   Mosque compound to say the embassy move would represent an "assault" on Muslims across the globe. According to Mohammad Shtayyeh, a senior Palestinian official and Fatah central committee member, the Palestinian leadership has been informed by diplomatic contacts that Trump could call for the move in his inauguration speech on January 20. The Palestinians regard east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, while Israel proclaims the entire city as its capital. The city’s status is one of the thorniest issues of the     conflict.
