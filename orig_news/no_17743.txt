’  ’ ’   It was quite a week. ’ ’   From when Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the   United States last Friday through the end of this week, news   broke from the White House at a   pace unlike anything   seen previously. ’ ’   Trump signed executive orders   most of which cemented   concrete action on his most prominent campaign   promises. He also allowed access into his White House, providing   interviews to The New York Times, ABC, and Fox News, among   others.  ’ ’   At the same time,   on his   rhetoric,   stirring controversy over falsehoods he spread related to the   size of his inauguration crowd and beliefs he held that millions   voted illegally in the November election, costing him the popular   vote. ’ ’   "President Donald Trump has signature moments every hour," Matt   Mackowiak, a Republican strategist and president of the Potomac   Strategy Group, told Business Insider in an email. ’ "   Here’s how the week that was  —   the first of Trump’s presidency  —     went down: " "   The first full day of the Trump presidency was highlighted by   nationwide  —   and international  —   marches in opposition to him.
