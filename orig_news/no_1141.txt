Here is some of what they reveal. ■ The disclosures include the complicated assets of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s daughter and    who retain vast business holdings. ■ Stephen K.

That makes Mr. Cohn, now the director of the National Economic Council and a central adviser to Mr. Trump, one of the wealthier members of the   Trump administration, which includes more than one billionaire. In addition to the many millions of dollars in cash and stock Mr. Cohn received from Goldman Sachs that made up the lion’s share of his personal assets, he held a slew of positions in publicly traded stocks  —   many of which he has already said he plans to sell  —   and in various private entities. Those entities include a stake valued at more than $1 million in a consumer education and consulting business called Payoff, a position in a cosmetics retailer also valued at more than $1 million, investments in several   concerns in Ohio valued at $100, 000 or more each, and an investment in a venture capital fund run by Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley powerhouse, valued at $100, 000 or more.  —   Kate Kelly Mr. Bannon may be one of the best known figures in the Trump White House, but as the Trump administration goes, he’s probably not one of the wealthiest.

He disclosed $191, 000 in consulting fees he earned from Breitbart News Network, the conservative media organization $125, 333 from Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked for the Trump campaign and $61, 539 in salary from the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit organization.

His bank accounts were valued at as much as $2, 250, 000, while he listed rental real estate valued at as much as $10. 5 million.

She was also paid for a speaking engagement at Point72 Asset Management, the investment firm run by the billionaire stock picker Steven A. Cohen.  —   Ben Protess Julia Hahn, until she went to work in the White House, was known as the   reporter who filled Breitbart. com with conservative screeds. But she is also quite rich for her age. A PNC custodial account owned by Ms. Hahn is valued at $500, 000 to $1 million. And various stock funds listed on her financial disclosure are worth as much as $1. 5 million. Her work as a journalist was also nothing to sneeze at. As a reporter, she made $117, 217 last year at Breitbart.

He also earned $10, 500 for delivering a speech in November to the Casket  Funeral Supply Association of America. ■ Sean Spicer, the press secretary, reported stakes in the   Company, McDonald’s and several real estate investments.

At his daily briefing on Friday, the White House press secretary Sean Spicer tried to put the best spin on the vast wealth that would be on display Friday night: The White House disclosures fit an   pattern in Washington of dumping mountains of documents on Fridays, when normal people have left work and are beginning to enjoy their weekend. Not many are likely to be glued to their computers and television sets to track the wealth of White House officials.
