Thursday on Fox New Channel’s "Fox  Friends," the former mayor of New York City and   Donald Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani called the protesters that were protesting over Trump’s victory that broke out in several cities Wednesday night were carried out by college students "a bunch of spoiled crybabies. "  Giuliani said, "The reality is they are a bunch of spoiled crybabies. Someone said we’re bringing up a generation of spoiled crybabies. Most kids aren’t crying. Most are going to class. I speak to a lot of college campuses. And what I find is we’re growing up a slightly higher percentage of conservative students than we used to. They are rebelling against the professors.
