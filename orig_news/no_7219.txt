Thursday on MSNBC’s "Andrea Mitchell Reports" former Obama administration Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is "accusing the president of the United States of treason and collaborating with the enemy. "  Panetta said, "Well, I have to tell you in 50 years of public life, I have never experienced a major party candidate making the accusations and raising the innuendos that Donald Trump raised, particularly at this moment of crisis. My experience is when this country has been attacked, this country comes together and unifies and builds a consensus about how we protect ourselves in the future. What Trump is doing is the exact opposite. "  "He’s not only accusing the president of the United States of treason and collaborating with the enemy, but in many ways what he’s saying about restricting Muslims from coming into this country, doing surveillance on Muslim mosques is basically aiding and abetting the enemy at a time when we ought to be unifying, working with the Muslim community to try to prevent against future attacks," he continued. "I think it’s the most irresponsible and reckless kind of behavior I’ve ever seen in a major presidential candidate. " (  Politico) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
