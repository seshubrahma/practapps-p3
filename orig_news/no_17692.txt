’  ’ ’   Officials say the Obama administration in its waning hours defied   Republican opposition and quietly released $221 million to the   Palestinian Authority. ’ ’   GOP members of Congress had been holding up the money. ’ ’   A State Department official and several congressional aides say   the outgoing administration formally notified Congress it would   spend the money Friday morning, just before Donald Trump became   president. ’ ’   More than $227 million in foreign affairs funding was released at   the time, including $4 million for climate change programs and   $1. 25 million for U. N. organizations. ’ ’   At least two GOP lawmakers had placed holds on the Palestinian   funds. Congressional holds are generally respected by the   executive branch but are not legally binding. ’ "   The official and the aides weren’t authorized to speak publicly   on the matter and demanded anonymity.
