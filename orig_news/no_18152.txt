’  ’ ’   The bond market has been quiet. Too quiet in fact.  ’ ’   That’’s about to change, says Societe Generale’’s fixed income   team led by Vincent Chaigneau.        "Spring is likely to be more threatening for bond investors as US   data improves, political risk in Europe ebbs and investors   refocus on a slow central bank exits," the team wrote in a note   to clients on Thursday. The note is titled "The Sleeping   Beast."  ’ "   In the wake of the U. S. Presidential election,   traders priced in the prospect that Donald Trump’s agenda of   a protectionist trade policy, cutting taxes, rolling back   regulations, and massive infrastructure would bring back   inflation to the United States. Reflecting this, the yield on     Treasurys rallied more than 80 basis points, reaching a   high of 2. 64% in the weeks following the election.  " ’   But for the last few months, the yield has been trapped in a   tight 35 basis point range as traders take a      approach in regards to Trump’’s ability to execute his proposed   agenda.    "We expect that to reverse in spring, especially if Trump proves   a little more effective in pushing his agenda through Congress,"   Societe Generale wrote. "Treasuries too present some seasonal   patterns: the average of the past five years shows the 10yT   reaching a low around   before bearish forces start to   take over." ’ ’  ’ ’   ’ ’   In its statement accompanying the March rate hike, the Federal   Open Market Committee reiterated its view for a total of . That has been followed up with   additional hawkish chatter from Fed members in recent weeks.   Several Fed members have reiterated the view of two more rate   hikes in 2017, and San Francisco Fed President John Williams even   took that a step further on Wednesday, suggesting .  ’ "   Currently, the market is pricing in a 60% chance the Fed’s next   rate hike comes in June or sooner, according to World Interest   Rate Probability data provided by Bloomberg. Additionally, it   thinks there’s a 55. 8% probability of at least two rate hikes by   the end of 2017.  " ’   If everything plays out the way Societe Generale thinks it will,   the   should get to 3. 10% according to their model.  ’ ’   There is one caveat to the call  —   the looming threat of a   government shutdown. The banks says that the odds of a shutdown   have declined, but have not completely disappeared. If that   happens the bank says the   yield could fall below 2. 25%.     ’ ’The bond market has been quiet. Too quiet in. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
