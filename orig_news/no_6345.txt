.@Judgenap: Three intel sources have disclosed that Pres. Obama turned to British spies to get surveillance on Trump pic. twitter.  Fox News Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano claimed "three intelligence sources" say President Obama looked to British spy agency GCHQ to obtain transcripts of conversations involving President Donald Trump on "Fox  Friends" on Tuesday.  Napolitano said, "[T]hree intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command. He didn’t use the NSA. He didn’t use the CIA. He didn’t use the FBI, and he didn’t use Department of Justice. He used GCHQ. What the heck is GCHQ? That’s the initials for the British spying agency. They have   access to the NSA database. So by simply having two people go to them saying, ‘President Obama needs transcripts of conversations involving candidate Trump, conversations involving   Trump,’ he’s able to get it, and there’s no American fingerprints on this.
