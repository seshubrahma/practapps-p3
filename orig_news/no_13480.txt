Saturday, on "CNN Newsroom," one of the men who helped stage the 1960   at a North Carolina Woolworth’s lunch counter to protest segregation endorsed GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.  Charles Henderson told CNN’s Jim Sciutto that he is drawn to Trump because of his business acumen and ability to create jobs, which he said black communities lack. "Donald Trump is a businessman, and America is a business," Henderson stated. "In order to run America, in order to be a part of running America, you have to understand the economics of America and that we are free society. " "He knows how to create jobs," he added. "One of the biggest problems in America right now, especially in black communities, are the lack of jobs. He has proven before that he knows how to create jobs. We are a country, the land of opportunity, not the land of entitlement. " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
