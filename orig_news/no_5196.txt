The March for Life announced a surprise VIP guest at the rally as well. "I’m delighted to welcome a remarkable   of rally speakers for what will truly be a historic 44th annual March for Life," said Jeanne Mancini, March for Life president. "Each of our speakers exemplifies this year’s theme, ‘the power of one’ in a beautiful way," noted Mancini. "Their words are sure to motivate the marchers, as well as the millions of   Americans who will be watching, who dedicate themselves to restoring a culture of life in the United States. " Conway is a longstanding   advocate, and Watson last year discussed the disproportionately high number of black babies aborted at clinics such as Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider. A devout Christian, Watson told TurningPointFriends. org as Planned Parenthood celebrated its centennial anniversary, "I do know that blacks kind of represent a large portion of the abortions, and I do know that honestly the whole idea with Planned Parenthood and [founder Margaret] Sanger in the past was to exterminate blacks, and it’s kind of ironic that it’s working. " The March for Life is the world’s largest   demonstration and each year draws tens of thousands of Americans from across the nation. The rally will begin at 11:45 a. m. EST and the march will start at 1:00 p. m. EST. The March for Life will begin on the grounds of the National Mall and end in front of the U. S. Supreme Court.
