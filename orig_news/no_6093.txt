In a video that accompanies the "Troubled Times" track from its new "Revolution Radio" album, Green Day takes several shots at   Donald Trump, depicting his caricature as a crazed leader.  Also shown throughout the video are   protesters and imagery from the Civil Rights era. The lyrics written by by Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Ryan Pritchard, Frank Edwin Wright III, however, do not mention Trump by name. Lyrics as follows: What good is love and peace on earth? When it’s exclusive? Where’s the truth in the written word? If no one reads itA new day dawningComes without warningSo don’t blink twice, We live in troubled timesWe live in troubled times, What part of history we learnedWhen it’s repeatedSome things will never overcomeIf we don’t seek itThe world stops turningParadise burningSo don’t think twice, We live in troubled timesWe live in troubled timesWe live in troubled times, We run for coverLike a skyscraper’s falling downThen I wander like a troubled mind, What good is love and peace on earth? When it’s exclusiveWhere’s the truth in the written word? If no one reads itA new day dawningComes without warningSo don’t look twice, (  Washington Examiner) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
