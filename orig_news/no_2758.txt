An    Muslim woman who claimed that three men attacked her on a Manhattan subway this month and tried to pull off her hijab was charged on Wednesday with filing a false report, the police said. The woman, Yasmin Seweid, a student at Baruch College, was also charged with obstructing governmental administration, the police said. Both charges are misdemeanors. Ms. Seweid, of New Hyde Park on Long Island, had told the police that three white men screaming "Donald Trump!" attacked her on Dec. 1 on an uptown No. 6 train at East 23rd Street, DNAinfo. com reported. She told the police that the men had called her a terrorist and that when she tried to move to the other end of the subway car, one of them followed and tried to pull off her traditional head scarf. DNAinfo reported that she recanted the story on Tuesday and had made it up to get attention because of problems she was having with her family. It was not immediately clear if she had a lawyer. A spokesman for the Council on   Relations, Ibrahim Hooper, said in an interview on Wednesday that Muslims in America were feeling "tremendous psychological stress and pressure" that can result in episodes like this one. "No one out of the blue decides to make this kind of report," he said. "Whenever there are these rare instances of alleged false reports  —   it’s still an allegation at this point  —   it’s used by the growing Islamophobic community to delegitimize and undermine the many legitimate   incidents. "
