"It is good to be home," Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said as he spoke at the podium, his wife Jane by his side, from his home state of Vermont following a decisive win there on Super Tuesday. [In his speech, Sanders stated his intention to "transform America" by spreading "Vermont values" all across the United States.  "We wanna win in every part of the country, that goes without saying. But it does say something, it means so much to me that the people who know me best  …     have voted so strongly to put us in the White House," he told the roaring crowd of his supporters. Sanders still trails Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton but insisted in his speech that he is on the path to victory. With 40 percent of the precinct votes in as of 9:10 p. m. ET, Sanders had 87% of the votes and won 10 delegates in Vermont. "This campaign is not just about electing a president. It is about transforming America," he said, again targeting the wealthy, billionaire class and pushing his vision for a popular elections strategy devoid of super PACs and in which a popular "one person, one vote" system determines the winner. Treading carefully, Sanders said, "Now I know that Secretary Clinton and many of the establishment people think that I am looking and thinking too big. I don’t think so. " He then railed against Republican presidential frontrunner and billionaire Donald Trump, calling for a political revolution. "When we bring our people together, when we do not allow the Donald Trumps of the world to divide us up  …     In Vermont, billionaires do not buy town meetings. And in America, we are going to end a corrupt campaign finance system. " He finished by stating, "I am so proud to bring Vermont values all across this country. We are gonna win because our message is resonating and the people, when we stand together, will be victorious. " Meanwhile, Sanders’ Vermont values soundbite had social media users questioning what Vermont values represent: @MSNBC@BernieSanders what are #VermontValues ? Coveting?
