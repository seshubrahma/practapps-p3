Washington (CNN) Donald Trump said Sunday that the U. S. would have to consider profiling Muslims in response to terror attacks. "I think profiling is something that we’re going to have to start thinking about as a country," Trump said on CBS’ "Face the Nation." "We really have to look at profiling. We have to look at it seriously. And other countries do it, and it’s not the worst thing to do. I hate the concept of profiling, but we have to use common sense. We’re not using common sense." After the Orlando terror attack, Trump reiterated his call to bar some Muslims from entering the country and his belief that U. S. officials should consider specifically profiling Muslims when looking to prevent terror attacks.  "People are dead. A lot of people are dead right now. So, everybody wants to be politically correct. And that’s part of the problem that we have with our country," Trump told CBS last December in the wake of the San Bernadino terrorist attack. But Attorney General Loretta Lynch cautioned against such an approach on Sunday, telling CNN’s Dana Bash that maintaining contacts within the Muslim community is very important because "if they’re from that community and they’re being radicalized, their friends and family members will see it first." "We investigate these cases aggressively, no stone is left unturned," she said on "State of the Union." "There is no backing away from an issue, there is no backing away from an interview because of anyone’s background. Because for us, the source of information is very, very important."
