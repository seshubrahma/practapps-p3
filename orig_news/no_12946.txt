After last night’s GOP debate in Charleston, SC, Republican presidential   Donald Trump declared to a group of reporters that his "bromance" with his opponent Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) was over, charging Cruz’s "aggressive" tack toward him was the indicator.  "I guess the bromance is over because he hit me, I didn’t hit him," Trump said. "I hit him after the fact   …     There was no reason for him to go that aggressive. " (  The Hill) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
