On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," Washington Post Opinion Writer David Ignatius stated, "It is outrageous to have someone running for president of the United States, have her husband raising money from foreign governments, from wealthy foreign individuals who want to influence the United States, it’s just wrong. " He added, "just stop it now. Not because it’s good politics, because it’s the right thing to do. "  Ignatius said, "It’s a steady drip, drip, drip of these stories that call into question her honesty and reliability. Anybody who knows the State Department would not find it surprising that you could lose thousands of documents in that institution, including these emails. It’s unfortunate. I doubt myself that, unless they’re major new revelations, either of these issues is going to move the needle enough in the groups that Trump needs to really make a difference in the election. I mean, the people who were shocked by emails, for whom Benghazi is a trigger point, those people are already Trump supporters. On this question of the Clinton Foundation, the New York Times is absolutely right. It is outrageous to have someone running for president of the United States, have her husband raising money from foreign governments, from wealthy foreign individuals who want to influence the United States, it’s just wrong. And I think anybody can feel that. And I don’t understand for the life of me why, when she said that she won’t do this, as president, just stop it now. Not because it’s good politics, because it’s the right thing to do. " (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
