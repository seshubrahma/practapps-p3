It has now been 259 days since Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton held a press conference and the hashtag #WheresHillary is trending #1 worldwide on Twitter. [Hiding Hillary continues to dodge open questions in favor of heavily staged and controlled media interviews. Mired in a variety of scandals and with serious questions swirling about her health, the Clinton campaign is doing everything they can to hide Hillary from unscripted questions. Her opponent, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, regularly gives access to the press during open press conferences. While much of the old media enables Hillary’s deception, social media is clamoring for her to be vetted, which has led #WheresHillary to trend #1 worldwide.  Free speech activist Mike Cernovich helped propel the hashtag as a way to draw attention to the fact that Hillary is avoiding public appearances even as Donald Trump holds regular rallies and delivered supplies during a trip to   Louisiana. #WheresHillary is the top trending subject on Twitter. Media still hides her! She’s too tired to hold a rally! pic. twitter.   —   Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) August 19, 2016,  Donald Trump gave the #WheresHillary a major boost when he answered the question with just a single word from his Twitter account. #WheresHillary?

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 20, 2016,  Hillary’s next scheduled event is a fundraiser with Cher on August 21st and her next scheduled speech isn’t until August 31st at the American Legion National Convention.
