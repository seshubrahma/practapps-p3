Former Secretary State Hillary Clinton is running a new ad condemning the tough rhetoric of Donald Trump, and making the case that she believes in respectful,   politics. ["I know what I believe, it’s wrong to pit people against each other," Clinton says in the ad. "We’ve had enough partisan division and gridlock already. "   The ad features footage of Trump mocking a New York Times reporter and urging supporters at a political rally to punch a protester in the face. "What kind of America do we want to be?" she asks. "Dangerously divided or strong and united? I believe that we are always stronger together. "
