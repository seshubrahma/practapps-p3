Friday on  MSNBC’s "Hardball," former Democratic presidential candidate and former Gov. Martin O’Malley ( ) said we cannot let   Donald Trump "commit war crimes," nor fill "internment camps. "  O’Malley said, "While all of us would like our president to succeed, we don’t want Donald Trump to succeed in ordering our troops to commit war crimes. We don’t want him to succeed in loading up   prisons with 8 million people in internment camps. Those are things we cannot compromise on. We need to be passionate about our values and we need to speak of issues that people care about most around their kitchen table, and that is their own kids’ future.
