’  ’ "   On February 20, 2014, Ukrainian riot police opened fire on   thousands of demonstrators who had gathered in central Kiev. They   were protesting President Viktor Yanukovych’s     decision to back out of a deal with the European Union that would   have distanced Ukraine from Russia and fostered closer ties with   the West. " ’   A   lawyer representing the victims of the mass police   shootings, Eugenia Zakrevska, now wants to know who was advising   or influencing Yanukovych when he ordered Ukrainian security   forces to crush the protests with force. ’ "   One familiar name that has emerged in recent weeks is Paul   Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager who advised Yanukovych   for nearly a decade. " "   Late last month, hackers broke into Manafort’s daughter’s iPhone   and published four years’ worth of purported text messages  —     roughly 300, 000 messages  —   on the dark web, an encrypted network   that can be accessed only with a special browser. " ’   Now, Zakrevska is calling on Manafort "to clarify the allegations   contained in the text messages and to contact us with any   information he may have" about the events that occurred in   central Kiev between February 18 and 20, 2014,  earlier this month. ’ ’   Reached for comment on Friday, Zakrevska told Business Insider   that there was still "no answer to my request, and I don’’t expect   it so quickly." ’ ’   Manafort did not respond to request for comment from Business   Insider. He  late last month that his daughter   Andrea had been hacked, and he corroborated some exchanges while   declining to comment on others. ’ ’   In a series of texts reviewed by Business Insider that appear to   have been sent by Andrea to her sister, Jessica, in March 2015,   Andrea said their father had "no moral or legal compass." ’ ’   "Don’’t fool yourself," Andrea wrote to her sister, according to   the texts. "That money we have is blood money." ’ ’   "You know he has killed people in Ukraine? Knowingly," she   continued, according to the reviewed texts. "As a tactic to   outrage the world and get focus on Ukraine. Remember when there   were all those deaths taking place. A while back. About a year   ago. Revolts and what not. Do you know whose strategy that was to   cause that, to send those people out and get them slaughtered." ’ ’  ’ ’   Andrea did not respond to a request for comment. ’ "   Paul was a top adviser to Yanukovych from 2004 to 2014. Ukrainian   authorities have said Yanukovych created the conditions that led   to the security forces opening fire. Ukraine’s interior minister    shortly   after the uprising. He fled to Russia and was granted asylum. " ’   Manafort has not been linked to the killings. ’ "   Manafort, a Republican operative who had advised authoritarian   leaders like the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Mobutu Sese Seko   and the Philippines’ Ferdinand Marcos, is credited with revamping   Yanukovych’s image and helping him win the presidency in 2010. " ’   Manafort advised Yanukovych until he was ousted amid the   protests. Manafort resurrected the Party of Regions in late 2014,   rebranding it as the Opposition Bloc and expanding it to include   parties that had been opposed to the protests and, later, to the   new   president, Petro Poroshenko. ’ ’   In a series of texts to a friend in March 2015, Andrea appears to   have said Ukraine was "late in paying" her father. ’ ’   "He is cash poor right now," the text said. "And now Ukraine is   late in paying him." ’ ’   In a later exchange with a man who appeared to be Andrea’’s cousin    —   and one of her father’’s former employees  —   Collin Bond, Andrea   appears to have said her mother and father couldn’’t go through a   "public divorce" because Manafort had "too many skeletons" and   "his work and payment in Ukraine is legally questionable." ’ ’   Bond worked as a political consultant and   attorney   for Manafort’’s consulting firm, Davis Manafort Partners Inc.   from 2005 to 2010, according to a LinkedIn page with his name. A   description of his work at the firm says he "worked with a team   that guided the client to victory in the 2010 Ukrainian   presidential election." ’ ’   Bond did not respond to request for comment. ’ ’   "He is a sick     tyrant," Andrea appears to have said to   Bond about her father. "And we keep showing up and dancing for   him. . .. We just keep showing up and eating the lobster. Nothing   changes." ’ " uncovered by an anticorruption center in Kiev in 2016   suggested that the Party of Regions had designated $12. 7 million   in undisclosed cash payments for Manafort between 2007 and 2012.   Manafort’s lawyer has  that he ever collected the earmarked payments. " ’   The New York Times  that a Ukrainian member of parliament had   accused Manafort of trying to hide $750, 000 in payments from the   Party of Regions by funneling it to offshore accounts. Manafort’’s   spokesman told The Times that the allegations were "baseless" and   should be "summarily dismissed." ’ ’On February 20, 2014, Ukrainian riot police. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
