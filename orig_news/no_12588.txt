Monday’s game between the Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints received a low 5. 7 rating, a 38 percent plunge from week three of last year. Notably, the game was competing against the first presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, an event that earned the biggest debate audience in U. S. political history. According to CNN Money, the September 26 debate brought in more than 80 million viewers. But the NFL has also been suffering under the   protests during the playing of the national anthem, which San Francisco 49ers second string quarterback Colin Kaepernick started three weeks ago. Since Kaepernick decided to sit out the anthem instead of standing at attention as everyone else was doing, a host of other players across the NFL have joined him in his attack on the United States. Some have decided to emulate Kaepernick’s action of staying seated during the anthem. Others took up his secondary protest of kneeling in the field during the song. Still others have taken to raising the militant black power fist in the air during the anthem. Not content with his   protests, Kaepernick has continued his   rants off the field. Recently, as a rejoinder to GOP nominee Donald Trump, he said the United States was never great. "He always says, ‘Make America great again,’" Kaepernick said of Trump. "Well, America has never been great for people of color and that’s something that needs to be addressed. Let’s make America great for the first time. " Since his first attempt to criticize the country, Kaepernick’s   protest has spread to other sports, including high school and college athletics.
