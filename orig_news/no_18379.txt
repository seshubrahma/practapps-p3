’  ’ ’   Senator Patrick Leahy, who sits on the Senate Judiciary   Committee, expressed concern on CNN Monday over whether or not   Russia was still "influencing" the actions of the United States. ’ ’   "If they are, then God save us all, because whether you’’re a   Democrat, a Republican, or an Independent, you’’d better fear for   the United States of America," the Vermont Democrat said. ’ ’   Trump was accused in a Washington Post article of having    highly classified information to Russian   Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak   during their meeting in the Oval Office last week. ’ ’   The information Trump revealed could have potentially jeopardized   a key intelligence source on ISIS, according to the Washington   Post, and the president did not have permission from the   source to reveal the information. However, as president he   was  to reveal the information. ’ ’   "It would be almost inconceivable that any president would allow   something of that nature out," Leahy said, when asked by Wolf   Blitzer about the possibility of Trump   sharing sensitive intelligence to the Russians. ’ ’’ ’   Leahy said that Trump’’s potential reveal could cause   distrust between the US and its sources. He said the US has   operatives that lay in "deep cover" for years "waiting for that   one time" they might have necessary information.  ’ ’   "We have very few allies we can share that information with,"   Leahy said. "We do it with the British . .. but very few others." ’ ’   Leahy also noted that the US has to "rely on countries   that normally we don’’t deal a lot with to on occasion give   us information." ’ ’   He added the US does not want to "turn off those sources" because   American operatives "can’’t be in every single place in the   world every single time. If we can’’t rely on others to help us,   then we’’re in deep trouble."  ’ ’Senator Patrick Leahy, who sits on the Senate. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
