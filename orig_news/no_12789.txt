Sen. Marco Rubio apologized to voters for a series of personal attacks against Donald Trump, which he employed to get recognition from the media and satisfy supporters who were tired of seeing the billionaire attack his fellow running mates unchallenged. ["As you got a little dirty   …     you got a little naughty," Kelly said, referring to the recent personal attacks.  "I’d do it differently, you know I really would," he said, in a   interview in Florida with Fox News host Megyn Kelly. Rubio began attacking Trump as a "clown" in advance of the   Super Tuesday primaries, mocking his hair, his face, his spray tan, the size of his hands (alluding to the size of his manhood) and suggesting that he wet his pants during the debate. Rubio told Kelly that his kids were "embarrassed" by the rhetoric and that his wife "didn’t like it. " "I don’t think it reflects good  —   that’s not who I am," he said. "That’s not what my campaign is going to be about. " "So you regret that?" Kelly asked. "Yeah, I’d do it differently, on the personal stuff. I’m not telling you that he didn’t deserve it, but that’s not who I am and that’s not who I want to be," he said. "And I honestly want to be a good example. I want my kids to be proud of me. And I don’t think it reflected well on my faith and I feel bad about that. " But Rubio said he didn’t feel badly about attacking Trump on his record. "On the issues that have to deal with Trump University, which he didn’t tell the truth about, on the issues that have to do with his business deals, and all of his jobs that he refuses to bring back from overseas, those are legitimate issues," he said.
