Friday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," Rep. Maxine Waters ( ) said of President Donald Trump declared "millennials" have joined her in her crusade against President Donald Trump.  Waters said, "I don’t honor him. I don’t respect this president. I don’t think that he deserves to be president of this great country. I am very concerned about him. And I really think he’s dangerous. And, Joe, I don’t know if you’ve seen the   series that the "L. A. Times" wrote about him. It is scathing. I’ve never seen editorials like this before in my life. " "And so, you know, we continue to talk about him as if this is normal," she continued. "Mika, that is abnormal, what we’re experiencing with this president. I have taken him on as you know, and the millennials have joined me. And so I continue to talk about his ties to Russia and what I think all of that means. And, as you know, I’ve continued to talk about, I believe if we have credible investigations, that it will lead to his impeachment. I believe that. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
