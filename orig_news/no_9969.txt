In an interview with Bloomberg, film producer and hip hop icon Ice Cube declared GOP frontrunner Donald Trump "is what Americans aspire to be. "[Donald Trump is "rich, powerful do what you want to do say what you want to say be how you want to be," Cube said on Wednesday. "That’s kind of been the American Dream. "  "So, [Trump] looks like a boss to everybody. And Americans love to have a boss," Cube added. WATCH:  Although Ice Cube says he understands Trump’s appeal, the   Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member doesn’t think a Trump presidency will benefit the poor. Ice Cube says he doesn’t think Donald Trump is "going to do anything to help poor people or people that’s struggling" because Trump is a "rich white guy. " "How can he relate?" Cube asks. "He’s always been rich. And being rich doesn’t make you bad. But how can he relate to the small guy?" Ice Cube’s newest comedy, Barbershop: The Next Cut, opens in theaters April 15.
