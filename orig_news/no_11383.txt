Thursday at the U. S. Bank Arena in Cincinnati, while discussing his victory,   Donald Trump said not only did he break the Democrats’ blue wall of the Midwestern states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, he declared his campaign "shattered that sucker. "  Trump said, "OK, hould I go on with this just a little bit longer? I love it. How about, it’s like 12 o’clock in the evening and Pennsylvania, I’m leading by a lot. And we couldn’t get off 98 percent. They didn’t want to call it. We’re leading by so much that it is impossible.  If I lost every other vote  —   and they refused to call. Then at 3:00  —   I’ll never forget. " "I watched a particular person  —  and we won Wisconsin, and we won Michigan, and we won Pennsylvania, and that person is doing the map," he continued. "And that person was saying for months that there is no way that Donald Trump can break the blue wall. Right? We didn’t break it. We shattered that sucker. We shattered it. We shattered it, man. That poor wall is busted up. So I’ll never forget it though because it felt so good. Moreso because they kept saying there is no path and all this nonsense. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
