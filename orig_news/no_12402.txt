NBC’s Today Show host Matt Lauer is set to moderate a forum with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in New York City. [Lauer will not be moderating a debate, but rather interviewing the two candidates, who will presumably be sitting down answering questions from a   audience.  This forum will give Trump an opportunity to rail against Clinton’s vote for the Iraq War and present himself as a change agent on foreign policy.
