Sunday on NBC’s "Meet The Press," New York Times columnist David Brooks said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign was "based on bigotry. "  Brooks said, "One final point. this wasn’t just a comment about Mr. Khan. This is a campaign based on bigotry. His campaign took off after San Bernardino and banning Muslims from coming here. We just saw the face of Muslims, that is the reality. I know what temperament means. Attention is the ultimate act of self control. The guy can’t control his attention span. His mind goes bing, bing, bing, bing to one thing after another and it’s just a dangerous prospect in a president to have somebody who just can’t control what’s going to come out of his mouth in the next 30 seconds.
