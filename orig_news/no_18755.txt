’’ "Donald Trump’s path to clinching the Republican nomination ahead of the party’s July convention is looking increasingly improbable, according to FiveThirtyEight editor in chief Nate Silver." ’Silver’’s  finishing at 1, 155 delegates  —   82 short of the 1, 237 needed to secure the GOP bid heading into the convention.
