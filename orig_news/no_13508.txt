Shawn Moran, Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council, which has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (although Moran says he doesn’t have a personal opinion on the race) said that President Obama "has done everything he possibly can, through policy, to restrict Border Patrol agents from doing their jobs" and that the Border Patrol’s hands are tied on Friday’s "Varney  Co. " on the Fox Business Network.  Moran was asked, "Shawn, do you think your hands are tied when it comes to securing the border?" He responded, "Oh, absolutely, Stuart, and thanks for having me here. President Obama has done everything he possibly can, through policy, to restrict Border Patrol agents from doing their jobs. And it does not make this country safer. It, in fact, does the opposite. It makes the border more vulnerable, and we’re seeing that. " He also questioned on whether a wall on the southern border would stop people from digging tunnels. Moran answered, "Well, let me clarify, our union is a Trump supporter. I personally don’t have an opinion. But, I don’t think a wall is going to stop it. It’s like being an assassin, if you are committed enough, you are going to commit your crime, and that includes crossing the border. So, the southern border is porous enough, that if you try hard enough, and you are willing to do what it takes, you will get across that border. " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
