"No matter that he   is inexperienced, uninformed, and irresponsible (to say the very   least). Both candidates seem disturbingly disconnected, in their   own ways. Hillary Clinton from the people. Donald Trump from   rationality." ’ ’   "I’m feeling less apathetic about this election," she added.   "It’s not that Clinton has shown herself to be more than just the   lesser of two evils. It’s that her impending victory represents   the triumph of nuance and poise over prejudice and childishness.   And that’s something I can get excited about." ’ ’President Donald Trump is "very upset" that. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
