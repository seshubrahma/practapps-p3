CHARLOTTE, N. C.  —   A second night of protests set off by the police killing of a black man spiraled into chaos and violence after nightfall here Wednesday when a demonstration was interrupted by gunfire that gravely wounded a man in the crowd. Law enforcement authorities fired tear gas in a desperate bid to restore order. The city said on its Twitter account that the unidentified man was on life support after what officials said was a "civilian on civilian" confrontation. The authorities provided no further details. Charlotte officials had said earlier that the man had been killed in the unrest. The Police Department reported that four officers had injuries that were not  . Gov. Pat McCrory’s office said late Wednesday that he had declared an emergency and had "initiated efforts" to deploy the National Guard and the state Highway Patrol. The shooting heightened the tension among the demonstrators and the police alike. City officials were quick to say the police had not fired any live rounds, but riot police personnel did fire repeated rounds of tear gas. The scene of the shooting and the largest demonstration of the evening happened along a crowded street in Charlotte’s city center, where the sound of gunfire mixed with the noise of people banging objects into vehicles. The gunshot victim lay motionless on the ground, his eyes open, as people surrounded him and blood pooled among their feet. He was taken into the nearby Omni Hotel, and a series of confrontations played out afterward as the police kept people from entering. There was sporadic looting. Twitter messages showed that the team store of the Charlotte Hornets of the N. B. A. had been broken into and gutted of merchandise. "We are working very hard to bring peace and calm back to our city," Mayor Jennifer Roberts said on CNN. A spokesman for Ms. Roberts said she had requested and planned to review on Thursday a police dashboard video of the encounter with Keith L. Scott, the black man who was shot and killed here on Tuesday. But she said she would not make the video public. Around 10 p. m. the police ordered all civilians, including members of the news media, to leave parts of the Uptown neighborhood and threatened to arrest those who did not comply. When the crowd did not respond immediately, the authorities fired more tear gas within minutes. After that, it appeared that the crowd started to disperse, although some stragglers remained in the area. The unrest in Charlotte came after two other   deadly shootings in the last week. First came the shooting of a teenager in Columbus, Ohio, who had been brandishing a BB gun. Two days later, on Friday, was the shooting death in Tulsa, Okla. of a man who had his hands above his head before an officer opened fire. And then it was Charlotte, where Mr. Scott, 43, black like the other two, was shot by a police officer in a parking space marked "Visitor" outside an unremarkable apartment complex. On Wednesday that parking space was both a shooting site and a shrine, and Charlotte was a city on edge, the latest to play a role in what feels like a recurring, seemingly inescapable tape loop of American tragedy. "To see this happen multiple times  —   just time after time  —   it’s depressing, man," said Tom Jackson, 25, who works with mentally disabled people. He didn’t know Mr. Scott but was drawn here nonetheless, one of many strangers and friends who came to pay their respects and make sense of their sorrow. In addition to the fatal attacks on police officers in Baton Rouge and Dallas, it was another grim snapshot of America’s continuing crisis in black and blue, this moment amplified by presidential politics. And as usual, there was very little consensus on what went wrong and how to fix it. At a news conference on Wednesday, Kerr Putney, chief of the   police, said officers had found the gun that the police said Mr. Scott had brandished before an officer, who is also black, fatally shot him and were examining police video of the encounter that unfolded as Mr. Scott stepped out of a car. Family members of Mr. Scott have said that he was unarmed and was holding only a book. Chief Putney said Wednesday morning, "We did not find a book. " The response of B. J. Murphy, an   activist here, could not have been more different: "Everybody in Charlotte should be on notice that black people, today, we’re tired of this," he said, adding an epithet. "We’re tired of being killed and nobody saying nothing. We’re tired of our political leaders going along to get along they’re so weak, they don’t have no sympathy for our grief. And we want justice. " All three shootings are under investigation, and are rife with questions. The police in Columbus said that the BB gun wielded by    Tyre King was built to look nearly identical to a Smith  Wesson Military  Police semiautomatic pistol. Mayor Andrew J. Ginther blamed the shooting, in part, on Americans’ "easy access to guns, whether they are firearms or replicas. " In Tulsa, the police said investigators found the drug PCP in the shooting victim’s S. U. V. The drug is known to induce erratic behavior in some users. But Mr. Crump, who is representing the family of the victim, Terence Crutcher, said the discovery of the drug, if true, would not justify the deadly shooting. In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Crutcher’s father, the Rev. Joey Crutcher, said his son had marched in protest of earlier police killings and had thought about how to protect himself during interactions with police officers. They had planned to go to a church event aimed at teaching people how behave around the police and avoid becoming another hashtag shared on social media by Black Lives Matter protesters. "I never thought this would happen to my family," Mr. Crutcher said, adding that he had counseled his son all his life about how to behave around the police. "I said, ‘Whenever you’re stopped by a police and you’re in that situation, raise your hands up, always let them see your hands, let them see that you are not going for a gun.’ And that is what Terence was doing. I said, ‘Always put your hands on your car.’ I made that specific, ‘your car.’ And that’s what Terence was walking to do on his car so that they could see his hands. " John Barnett, a civil rights activist in Charlotte, said during a raucous news conference near the site of the shooting that Mr. Scott had been waiting for his son to arrive home from school. "The truth of the matter is, he didn’t point that gun," Mr. Barnett said. "Did he intend to really sit in a vehicle, waiting on his son to get home from school and then plot to shoot a cop if they pulled up on him?" Adding to an atmosphere loaded with suspicion and mistrust, residents of the apartment complex gave varying accounts of Mr. Scott’s death. Some differed from the police on which officer fired the shots, and others said that no one had tried to administer CPR for Mr. Scott as officials had said. Brentley Vinson, the officer who the police say shot Mr. Scott, is black, as is the police chief. "Since black lives do not matter for this city, then our black dollars should not matter," said Mr. Murphy, the activist. "We’re watching a   lynching on social media, on television and it is affecting the psyche of black people. " Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said Wednesday that the Justice Department "is aware of, and we are assessing, the incident that led to the death of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte. " Responding to another police shooting, the state’s attorney in Baltimore County, Md. Scott D. Shellenberger, announced Wednesday that no charges would be filed against any of the officers involved in the Aug. 1 shooting death of Korryn Gaines or the shooting of her    son. In Charlotte, Rakeyia Scott, Mr. Scott’s wife, said on Wednesday the family was "devastated" by the shooting. She described her husband as "a loving husband, father, brother and friend" and called on protesters to remain peaceful. At a campaign rally in Orlando, Fla. Hillary Clinton spoke about the shootings here and in Tulsa. "There is still much we don’t know about what happened in both incidents, but we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of   killed by police officers in these encounters,’’ she said. "It’s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable. We also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week. And last night in Charlotte, 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Scott’s death. Every day police officers are serving with courage, honor and skill. " Her Republican rival, Donald J. Trump, reacted on Twitter. "Hopefully the violence  unrest in Charlotte will come to an immediate end," he wrote. "To those injured, get well soon. We need unity  leadership. " Unity, thus far, has been in short supply. On Friday, Mr. Trump earned the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police. But polls show that his support among   is negligible, even though he has singled them out in promising to solve the ills of poverty and violence that he has characterized as plaguing black neighborhoods. On Wednesday, Mr. Jackson, the man who came here to mourn, was not thinking about the current presidential candidates. The police, he said, "are out here killing people, and they don’t even know their backgrounds," he said. "They could be killing the next president. "
