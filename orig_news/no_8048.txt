The hashtag #BoycottHamilton became a top trend on social media Saturday after cast members from the popular Broadway show Hamilton lectured Vice   Mike Pence from the stage on Friday night. [Pence was apparently booed as he took his seat. As the performance concluded and Pence exited the theater, actor Brandon Victor Dixon lectured him about how a "diverse America" is "alarmed and anxious" about the incoming Trump administration.  "We, sir  —   we  —   are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights," Dixon said as Pence exited the building. The fallout and backlash have been swift. Supporters of   Trump surrounded the Richard Rodgers Theater on Saturday morning, where the popular Broadway show is performed: #BoycottHamilton, Trump Flash Mob at Hamilton Theater Today!  226 W 46th St, NYC pic. twitter.   —   Jack Posobiec (@JackPosobiec) November 19, 2016,  Indeed, social media exploded with users making #BoycottHamilton a top trend: #boycotthamilton is #1 on Twitter.
