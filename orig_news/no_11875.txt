Honored to have received the endorsement of Lou Holtz   a great guy! #INPrimary #Trump2016 pic. twitter.  A week after getting Indiana Hoosiers legendary coach Bobby Knight’s endorsement, GOP presidential   Donald Trump picked up an endorsement from former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz.  Trump tweeted out the video of Holtz, who cited the real estate mogul’s "first class" hotels and golf courses. Holtz added that Trump "wants his country to be first class as well. " "There are nothing but winners in Indiana. The main reason I’m endorsing him  —   I’ve played his golf course, I’ve stayed in his hotel, he does nothing but go first class in everything," Holtz said. "He wants his country to be first class as well. " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
