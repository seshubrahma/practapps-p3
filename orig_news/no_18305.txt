Because that’s the tone  has   one in which pushing out a 5yr old and his mother is somehow a good idea. ’t’t" "   Casey said the mother had witnessed her cousin’s murder back in   Honduras and was being pursued by gangs before she and her son   fled and sought refuge in the US. " ’   They were detained in the Berks County Residential Center since   late 2015,  and an application for Special Immigrant   Juveniles Status had been submitted just this week. ’ ’   "We literally were arguing to include this child while   immigration was watching the plane take off," attorney Bridget   Cambria told NBC 10. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tThe gangs will target this mother and her child the moment they land in Honduras, yet Trump admin insists on this cruel policy. ’t’t’ " ’t’t’tThis 5yr old and his mother aren’t ’bad hombres.’ They aren’t in a gang, they’re running from   vulnerable and scared. ’t’t" ’  ’ ’Senator Bob Casey sent out a series of tweets. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
