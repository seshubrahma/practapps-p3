Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed on terrorism, jobs, race relations and, above all, basic issues of honesty and trustworthiness during their first presidential debate.

Houston suffered through a mass shooting. The authorities said that a heavily armed man wearing a uniform emblazoned with a Nazi symbol opened fire at random in a residential area near a mall.

I. figures showed homicides skyrocketing 10. 8 percent from 2014 to 2015, the largest   rise since 1968. But most of the country was far safer.

Chris Christie’s   bid. David Wildstein, a Christie ally, also testified about how many top Christie operatives he told.
