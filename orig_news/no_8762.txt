Individuals earning more than $250, 000 (or $500, 000 if filing jointly) will not be eligible for the deduction. For a family earning $70, 000 per year in the 12 percent tax bracket with $7, 000 in child care expenses, the deduction would reduce taxes by $840 per year.• The plan will offer child care spending rebates to   taxpayers through the existing Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). This could mean almost $1, 200 per year per eligible family.• Mr. Trump’s plan will ensure    parents will receive the same tax deduction as working parents, offering compensation for the job they’re already doing, and allowing them to choose the child care scenario that’s in their best interest. PROPOSAL: The Trump plan would create new Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) so that families can set aside extra money to foster their children’s development and offset elder care for their parents or adult dependents. These new accounts are available to everyone, and allow both   contributions and   appreciation     current law Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) which are available only if it is offered by an employer and does not allow balances to accumulate.• When established for a minor, funds from a DCSA can be applied to traditional child care,   enrichment programs and school   to school choice. To help   parents, the government will match half of the first $1, 000 deposited per year.• When established for an elderly dependent, a DCSA can cover a variety of services, including   nursing and   care. PROPOSAL: Mr. Trump’s plan will provide regulatory reform to promote new   and   solutions, and also add incentives for employers to provide child care at the workplace. The ability to set aside funds will be particularly helpful to women,   workers and minorities, who are statistically more likely to reduce time working outside the home in order to provide unpaid care. PROPOSAL: The Trump plan will guarantee six weeks of paid maternity leave by amending the existing unemployment insurance (UI) that companies are required to carry. The benefit would apply only when employers don’t offer paid maternity leave, and would be paid for by offsetting reductions in the program so that taxes are not raised. This enhancement will triple the average paid leave received by new mothers. Frequently Asked Questions About The Trump Child Care PlanQ: How Will The Plan Be Paid For?• The child care plan is part of the comprehensive tax, trade, energy and regulation reform plan proposed by Donald Trump at the Detroit Economic Club. More details about his tax plan will be discussed later this week at the New York Economic Club. The child care plan itself can more than be offset by additional growth. About   of the entire Trump tax reform program will offset by the increases in economic activity that accompany   tax reform, better trade deals, regulatory and immigration reform, and unleashing American energy. The remaining   will be offset by minor changes in the current trajectory of spending for federal agency operations, excluding Defense, Veterans, Social Security and Medicare. Q: Will The Benefits Already Provided For Child Care Expenses, Like The Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account And Child Tax Credit, Be Eliminated Under The Trump Plan?• No, the benefits provided by the Trump child care plan are in addition to the benefits available under current law. Current programs do not serve the large numbers of families that would benefit from the Trump plan, but if a family finds that it benefits more from existing programs, they would still be available. The only restriction would be that the same child care spending cannot be used for multiple benefits programs —  no  . Q: Will   Couples Receive The Benefits?• The benefits would be available in the same way that the IRS currently recognizes   couples: if the marriage is recognized under state law, then it is recognized under federal law. Q: Will The Maternity Leave Policy Cause Employers To View Women As Less Desirable Employees Because Of Paid Leave?• No. The cost to an employer of hiring should not be affected by this   policy, so the employer should not view hiring women as adding to their costs of Unemployment Insurance. Further, employers in a competitive marketplace should not eliminate existing maternity care benefits to instead take advantage of the UI system. The UI benefit would only equal what would be paid to a   employee, which is much less than a workers’ regular paycheck. This should prevent abuse while providing a safety net for the sake of the health of mother and child. Donald J. Trump’s Plan Is More Complete Than Hillary Clinton’s Plan, Point One: Hillary Clinton does not have a plan to provide relief to most Americans faced with high child care costs. She claims she wants to cap a family’s child care expense at 10 percent of income, but provides no details. The Trump plan would provide relief to every   and   earner who has child care expenses. For example, the Trump plan would reduce taxes by $840 per year a family for earning $70, 000 per year in the 12 percent tax bracket with $7, 000 in child care expenses Hillary Clinton’s plan would provide no relief to this family. Point Two: Hillary Clinton prefers institutional child care that does not meet the needs of workers in rural areas or who have schedules that require working on a night shift or on call. The Trump plan would give states the flexibility to establish standards that fit the needs of state residents without compromising quality. Point Three: Hillary Clinton would force businesses to pay for 12 weeks of   family leave at their expense. The Trump plan proposes 6 weeks of partial pay through the existing Unemployment Insurance system, fully paid for within the program.   6:45: Many minority millennials who can’t stand Clinton and Trump seem very open to voting for Green Party candidate Jill Stein: "Instead of a war on poverty, they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me."  —   #TupacShakur,  —   Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) September 13, 2016,  6:40: Gary Johnson with former Indiana Governor, Bush ally, and Purdue President Mitch Daniels at an event: Presidential candidate Gary Johnson has an open discussion with Purdue president Mitch Daniels#GaryJohnson #Purdue pic. twitter.   —   The Purdue Review (@PurdueReview) September 13, 2016,  6:35: Former RNC Chair Marc Racicot says Gary Johnson should be included in the debates as Johnson announces he will be on the ballot in every state: Libertarian Gary Johnson’s campaign announces candidate will be on the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, D.

There’s one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and that’s Donald Trump. Not only has Trump embraced Putin, he publicly encouraged further Russian espionage to help his campaign. Like so many of the words Trump has uttered this election season, his statements encouraging cybercrime are dangerous, divisive, and unprecedented. 4:20: In Florida, Trump gets 29% of the Hispanic vote and Clinton is seven points behind where Obama was with Hispanics in 2012. According to the report, "Clinton is also underperforming compared to Obama in three other heavily Hispanic swing states polled: Arizona, Colorado and Nevada. " Nearly half of Florida’s Hispanics think Clinton is a "liar. " The poll by   Bendixen  Amandi International and The Tarrance Group shows Clinton drawing 53 percent among Florida Hispanics, compared to Trump’s 29 percent. That’s a significant   lead. But Obama hit 60 percent among Latinos in 2012, according to exit polls. He defeated Mitt Romney in Florida by a single percentage point. "She should not only be where Obama is  —   she should be beating those numbers, and she’s not," pollster Fernand Amandi told the Miami Herald.

Whites with no college experience have become 14 points more likely to affiliate with the GOP since 2008, including a   shift over the last four years. White voters age 65 and older are now 13 points more likely to identify as Republican or lean Republican than they were eight years ago.
