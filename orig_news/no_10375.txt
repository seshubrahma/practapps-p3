Partial Transcript as follows: TODD: You’ve said you’re willing to bring up Bill Clinton’s past with women if Hillary Clinton attacks you for being a sexist. So is that a threat to her? Is that essentially what you’re saying is, hey, you want know go down that road, you go down that road, I go down this road. TRUMP: I don’t want to say this is a threat but it’s a threat   …     of course, I can call her a nicer name. she was saying he has tendency towards being sexist   …     talking about me. She’s married to an abuser  —   a woman claimed rape, horrible things. " TODD: You know if you bring it up people will bring up your  —   your first divorce was ugly  —   all over the tabloids. TRUMP: But I wasn’t the president of the United States and I wasn’t dealing in the Oval Office, all right? A big difference. I wasn’t the president. And my first wife thinks I’m great and my second wife and  —   and I have a great marriage. I mean, I have a great marriage. So  —   I mean, it’s fine. I’m not saying don’t bring anything up with me. But when she says that, I had to bring it up. And by the way, they’ve become very unresponsive since then.
