’  ’ ’     Donald Trump claimed on Saturday to   know "a lot about hacking" and said the best way to send   important communications is to "have it delivered by courier, the     way." ’ ’   "I don’’t care what they say, no computer is safe,"   said Trump, who does not use a computer. ’ ’   "I have a boy who’’s 10 years old, he can do anything with a   computer," the   added, according to the pool   report. "You want something to really go without detection, write   it out and have it sent by courier." ’ ’   Trump also responded to a question about alleged hacking during   the election and his reluctance to attribute the attacks to   Russia, saying it would be "unfair" to lay blame without first   being certain. ’ ’   The Obama administration on Thursday took action against Russia   for the alleged hacking, issuing sanctions and expelling 35   diplomats. ’ ’’ ’   "I also know things that other people don’’t know, and so they   cannot be sure of the situation," Trump said. ’ ’   Asked what he knew that others do not, Trump replied:   "You’’ll find out Tuesday or Wednesday." ’
