’  ’ ’   JALALABAD,  (Reuters)   Three American   soldiers were killed and one wounded on Saturday when an Afghan   soldier opened fire on them in eastern    according to three US officials. ’ ’   The shooting occurred in the Achin district of Nangarhar   province, where US special forces have been fighting alongside   Afghan troops against Islamic State and Taliban militants, said   Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the Nangarhar provincial   governor. ’ ’   The Afghan soldier was killed in the incident, Khogyani said. ’ ’   "The cause of the shooting is not clear. An investigation has   already begun," he said. ’ ’   One US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,   confirmed that the incident was a "  " attack by a   member of the Afghan security forces in Nangarhar province. ’ ’’ ’     "  " insider attacks by Afghan soldiers on   international service members were a major problem several years   ago, but now occur less frequently after security measures were   improved and the number of foreign troops in the country fell   sharply. ’ ’   In March, three US soldiers were wounded when an Afghan soldier   opened fire on them. ’ "   The attack comes as President Donald Trump’s administration   weighs an increase in troops in the   country.
