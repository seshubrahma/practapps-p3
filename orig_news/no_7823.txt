Sunday on CNN’s "State of the Union," Gov. Martin O’Malley ( ) a former candidate for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, said "many   Republicans" will not support presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s "fascist appeal.’  O’Malley said, "President Obama doesn’t say this about all Republicans but he does say rightly that Donald Trump is a bigot. Donald Trump is a racist. Donald Trump in fact is making fascist appeals. That’s why many   Republicans are not supporting Donald Trump for president. Look, being president of the United States is the toughest job in the world and I can tell you, as someone who has worked with Secretary Clinton and competed against her that she is a tough person who is ready to do this job. Donald Trump is an unstable charlatan who is appealing to the worst instincts in people, and I believe ultimately the American people are going to reject that. This is a very different sort of candidacy. This is not the party of Lincoln. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
