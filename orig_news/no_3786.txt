Two out of every three Donald Trump voters turn off awards show when actors, singers and other entertainers start preaching politics, according to new data published by the Hollywood Reporter. [The National Research Group surveyed 800 people  —   half who voted for Hillary Clinton and half who pulled the lever for Donald Trump. The data revealed that 66 percent of Trump voters changed the channel whenever an actor began to lecture about politics, compared to just 19 percent of Clinton voters.  Another 44 percent of Trump voters said awards show speeches are "too political," compared to Clinton backers who said they want more politics at the Academy Awards. About 39 percent of Clinton voters want to hear about women’s rights, while another 34 percent indicated they want to hear artists speak about Trump’s executive order temporarily suspending the United States’ refugee program. More than   or 68 percent, of Trump voters say they "dislike" political speeches at the Oscars, while just 23 percent of Clinton voters said they felt the same. Interestingly, about 25 percent of Trump and Clinton voters stated that they don’t find   awards show speeches to be persuasive.
