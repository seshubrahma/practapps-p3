’  ’ ’   Hillary Clinton declared war Thursday on the aggressive wing of   the conservative news media. ’ ’   During a major speech on the  in Nevada, the Democratic presidential nominee took   aim at media like the website Breitbart and Alex Jones, a     host famous for pedaling conspiracy theories. ’ ’   Clinton said that  was a result, perhaps, of consuming such media. ’ ’   "It’s what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones,   who claims that   and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside   jobs," she said. "He said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre   were child actors and no one was actually killed there. " ’ ’   At one point in her speech, Clinton read a series of headlines   from Breitbart. ’ ’   "To give you a flavor of his work, here are a few headlines   they’ve published," she said, proceeding to pronounce the   headlines while her audience of supporters gasped and jeered: ’ ’   The former secretary of state quoted the Southern Poverty Law   Center, a nonprofit that tracks hate groups, which alleged   Breitbart embraces "ideas on the extremist fringe of the   conservative right. Racist ideas. " ’ ’   Clinton then attacked Stephen Bannon, the executive chairman of   Breitbart whom Donald Trump recently named as the chief executive   of his campaign. ’ ’   "Bannon has nasty things to say about pretty much everyone," she   said, later adding, "No wonder he’s gone to work for Trump. " ’ ’   Breitbart responded on Twitter and on its website by attempting   to turn the tables on Clinton. The   website   dubbed her "tinfoil Hillary" on its front page and published   this tweet: ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tMUH PUTIN IS BEHIND IT ALL  ’
