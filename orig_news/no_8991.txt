Responding to Ted Cruz’s remark during Thursday Night’s GOP debate that Donald Trump once fired Dennis Rodman on Celebrity Apprentice, the NBA’s most famous weirdo sent a message to the Texas lawmaker that "he’s about to fire his ass too. "[Yes @tedcruz @realdonaldtrump did fire me on Celebrity Apprentice. But he’s about to fire your ass too! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain,  —   Dennis Rodman (@dennisrodman) February 26, 2016,   During a heated exchange in last night’s Republican presidential debate in Houston, Senator Cruz ridiculed billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump claiming that while he was busy fighting the controversial Gang of Eight amnesty bill, the New York businessman wasted his time as a realty game show host.

Notwithstanding Rodman’s penchant for bizarre behavior like his 2013 trip to North Korea to nurture leader Kim  ’s obsession with the Chicago Bulls, the outrageous Rodman snagged almost 12, 000 rebounds over 14 season averaging 13. 1 per game. Dennis the Menace swinging voters in Trump’s direction is doubtful. Yet, if Trump can win the GOP election, it might be nice having Rodman as his nomination party coordinator.
