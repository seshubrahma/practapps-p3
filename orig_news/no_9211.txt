GOP frontrunner Donald Trump says the public should see the 28 classified pages within the   Commission’s report on the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attack. ["I think we should have seen it a long time ago," the real estate mogul stated during an interview Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends. "  The classified pages allegedly contain a link to Saudi Arabia, according to various media reports. "I think I know what it’s going to say," Trump speculated. "It’s going to be very, very profound, having to do with Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia’s role on the World Trade Center, and the attack. " "And you know, I’ve said it for a long time. We attacked Iraq. And frankly by attacking Iraq  —   they were not the ones who knocked down the World Trade Center," added Trump, who has long been a critic of President George W. Bush’s decision to invade Iraq. "Now I’ve been saying that for a long time. Let’s see what the papers say   …     I think they’re going to be finally, at least in some form, released. " Commenting the rumor that Saudi Arabia may be linked to the attack, Trump said, "You know, It’s sort of nice to know who your friends are, and perhaps who your enemies are. " "But you’re going to see some very revealing things released in those papers and I look forward to reading them," he added.
