The Republican Party is "going to have to rethink the business of having open primaries and caucuses," Washington Post columnist George Will urged after noting that Donald Trump has been doing well in "open" primary contests. [Watch the Fox News Sunday video here:     Here is a transcript of Will’s exchange with host Chris Wallace: WALLACE:  How does a party  —   I know you say, well, look, a party is a strong structure and it’s gone through various permutations and combinations over the years, George, but how does a party survive when you’ve got, at least at this point, the two leading candidates, Trump and Cruz who are basically running against the Washington establishment and saying that they’re corrupt and they’re going to go in and change things? WILL: It survives by planning ahead in case Mr. Trump is the nominee.

FoxNews. com reported: To date, Trump has won a dozen contests, seven of which were open to voters regardless of party affiliation  —   and two of which have a hybrid system. He has won only three contests that were limited to registered Republicans  —   Nevada, Kentucky and Louisiana. (His victories in the latter two states were relatively tight.) By contrast, five of Cruz’s six victories came in closed or   contests. The only exception was Texas, his home state. Fox surmised that if Trump’s victories are indeed being aided by   voters, that may suggest "he’s a stronger general election candidate than Democrats give him credit for.
