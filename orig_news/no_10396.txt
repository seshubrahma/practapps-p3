During the May 20 NRA Leadership Forum in Louisville, Kentucky, the NRA announced its endorsement of presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. [NRA executive vice president and CEO Wayne LaPierre said, "A Clinton White House would be a dangerous extension of the Obama White House. " He then pointed to the heinous Benghazi attack, the danger of a nuclear Iran, and the rapid and unchecked growth ISIS, suggesting these would be the norm under Clinton. He also described the way Clinton has clearly aligned herself against the Second Amendment.  He made clear that if Clinton is elected "it’s game over for everyone in this room and everything that we care about. " LaPierre then paused and said, "But there’s another future out there —  one we want for our children. " One of "the American Dream  …     and enduring freedom," and "we will elect our next president, we will save our freedom, and America will be great again. "   executive director Chris Cox then stepped up to the podium and said, "We have to unite and we have to unite right now. " The crowd rose to their feet in anticipation and began applauding even as Cox made it official by announcing the NRA’s endorsement of Donald Trump for president.
