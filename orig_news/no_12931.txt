During this week’s broadcast, "Saturday Night Live" ran an ad slamming GOP   Donald Trump and his supporters after he failed to denounce white supremacist David Duke last week on CNN’s "State of the Union. "  The ad, called "Racists for Trump," featured "real Americans" promoting Trump and then unveiling one person in a Nazi uniform, another ironing a KKK robe, another painting "white power" on a house, a woman with a board labeled "Muslims," a man burning a book about Mexico and another providing firewood for a cross burning with KKK members dancing alongside it.
