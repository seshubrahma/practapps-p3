CLEVELAND, Ohio  —   Ivanka Trump introduced her father 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump Thursday night at the Republican National Convention and revealed his record of employing women in business. ["He is colorblind and gender neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period," Ivanka declared to the thousands of supporters packed into Quicken Loans Arena.  Ivanka said her father employs more women executives and also pays them equally to men. "Women represent 46 percent of the total U. S. labor force," Ivanka told the audience, as she referenced the gender pay gap, as women aren’t always paid as much as men. "As a mother myself of three young children, I know how hard it is to work while raising a family  …    American families need relief. " "I will fight for this too right along side of him," Ivanka vowed about equal pay.
