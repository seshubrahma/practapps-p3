On Thursday CNN commentator Angela Rye denounced Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, claiming he is not fit to serve in a Donald Trump administration because he is "like a terrorist. "[Rye said she was shocked that "someone like Sheriff Clarke would be considered as a Homeland Security Secretary. Someone who [she] very much see( s) as, if he’s not a terrorist, inciting terrorism. " She added, "It’s hard for me to imagine, even if it was someone who was considered a Democrat or who was   and independent, it’s hard for me how [he could be part of the administration]. "   Don Lemon responded by pointing out that he had Sheriff Clarke on his show and that calling him "a terrorist" was a step too far. Rye tried to defend her position by claiming that Sheriff Clarke had referred to those protesting Trump as "whiny babies. " She added, "To be honest with you, there are black people in Milwaukee that would say to you, ‘Yeah, he is very much like a terrorist. ’" AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of "Bullets with AWR Hawkins," a Breitbart News podcast.
