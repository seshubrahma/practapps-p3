Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Israel said  it would move ahead with thousands of new homes in East Jerusalem, undeterred by the United Nations Security Council’s vote last week to condemn its settlement construction.

" The Israeli right is pushing Mr. Netanyahu to abandon the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. _____ • Russia is cultivating an array of   extremist groups across Europe in an effort to destabilize or simply disorient the European Union.

"NO WAY!" the   responded on Twitter. _____ • "I don’t want to be another cliché. " The death of the pop superstar George Michael stunned both fans and the many people who knew him in England, where he spent most of his life. Mr. Michael "sang about wanting to be free often enough to make you wonder whether he thought any freedom was ever attainable," our critic writes. _____ • The European Medicines Agency is likely to leave Britain  —   another casualty of the vote to leave the European Union, and one with worrying implications for the country’s vibrant biotech and pharmaceuticals sector. • The troubled Italian lender  Monte dei Paschi di Siena has a capital shortfall of 8. 8 billion euros, higher than previously estimated, the European Central Bank said. • The year’s best apps.

There’s just one snag: It is all but unknown in Germany. Christmas is over, but reminders of the holiday are most likely scattered around your home and office, or perhaps hiding inside a coat pocket. We’re talking about candy canes, whose ubiquity is matched by the legends surrounding their creation. One tale dates the candy to 1670, when a choirmaster at a cathedral in Cologne, Germany, needed a way to keep children entertained during long Christmas services. He asked a local confectioner to bend hard candy into the shape of a shepherd’s cane. About 200 years later, a   immigrant is said to have brought the tradition to America, decorating his Christmas tree with the canes, which were all white. In 1920, a Georgia candy maker developed a way to   colors into the canes, giving them their traditional red and white look, according to one account. The sweets were already popular then, and today they are part of a seasonal candy juggernaut that rakes in over $7 billion a year, according to an industry trade group. So what to do with the extra peppermint sticks? Perhaps crush them to use on ice cream or cookies. Or save them: Not only has the candy been around for centuries, it can last up to three years.
