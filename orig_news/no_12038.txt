GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is responding to the recent news that Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia restored the voting rights of more than 200, 000 felons. ["That’s crooked politics," Trump told his supporters during his Monday afternoon campaign rally in Warwick, Rhode Island. "I would win Virginia. "  "They’re giving 200, 000 people that have been convicted of heinous crimes  …    the right to vote. They know they’re going to vote Democrat," the Republican frontrunner said. "That could be the swing," referencing Virginia in the general election. "It’s dishonest," he said about the political system.
