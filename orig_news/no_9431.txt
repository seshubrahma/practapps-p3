Political operative Roger Stone told Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon Wednesday morning that he expects Donald Trump to sweep upcoming primary contests after big wins in Florida, Missouri and other states, and stopping him may be almost impossible.  "By my calculation, Trump now needs about 500 delegates, or only 50 percent of those remaining to secure the nomination," Stone said. "And this calendar is moving into some of Trump’s strongest states: Arizona, New York, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, New Jersey. I expect a Trump sweep of those. They account for about 366 delegates of the 946 left to be selected, so Trump needs about 150 votes of the 580 proportional delegates left to put him over the top. He is very very close to be able to pull this off. " Stone warned, however, that trouble for Trump could come with "some of the machinations of the Republican National Committee, the unbinding of delegates on the first ballot, monkey business about whether California is winner take all. " He said Cruz has very little chance to stop Trump.  "It is very, very close to impossible. Cruz can only tinker at the margins. " Not even Cruz’s superior political operation can overcome Trump’s message. "The fact that he is winning these states and winning them big in most cases with the exception of Missouri, is a testimony to the strength of the message rather than the Trump operation," Stone said. Stone said the only chance to unseat Trump is "on a late ballot if they can stall him just short of 1237 on the first ballot, which gets less likely every single time we have a primary.
