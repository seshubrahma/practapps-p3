Sunday on NBC’s "Meet the Press," former Defense Intelligence Agency Director and current adviser to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn, said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton should not be too big to jail.  Flynn said, "So a couple things. The very last thing that John Podesta just said is no individual too big to jail. That should include people like Hillary Clinton. Five people around her have had  —   have been given immunity to include her former chief of staff. When you are given immunity, that means you have probably committed a crime. I don’t know how he can sit there and say something like that with all the things that have been going around  —   just swirling around Hillary Clinton with her  .
