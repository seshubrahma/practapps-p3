Thursday, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan posted a video on his Facebook page from "The Cliff Kelley Show" on WVON from earlier this month in which he warned Americans about a Donald Trump presidency,  Farrakhan said, "Mr. Trump is tearing away the skin of the onion of white civility and the more he pulls the skin of that onion back, he’s beginning to show something in the character of the whites that follow him, that they don’t care what he says. He could say one thing this minute, another thing the next minute and you can see that the man has a little problem. A little problem. But he is exacerbating the race situation in America. " He continued, "I guarantee you if he becomes president —  if he becomes president he’ll take America exactly where America is heading. He’ll take you there on a rocket ship. How can a man say he is not a thug —  he’s a diplomat —  he’s a president. ‘We’ll go into Iraq and just take the oil out.’ See? That’s the thug coming out. That’s the part of the nature of the beast that’s manifesting. Well If he becomes your president, you’ll be just like him. " He added, "When you get leadership that is not rooted in justice, then they begin to make the people just like themselves. Be careful America. You’re headed into the abyss of hell, and if you make a mistake in choosing your leaders, maybe you’ll go there faster. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
