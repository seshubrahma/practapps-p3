Cleveland (CNN) A vehicle in Donald Trump’s motorcade was involved in a minor accident Monday in New York City on its way to the airport, as Donald and Melania Trump headed to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.  The vehicle was a staff car, and there were no injuries, a campaign source told CNN. Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort described the accident as a minor incident. Donald and Melania Trump are on their plane to Cleveland and are "all good," the source said.   The accident comes hours before Melania Trump is scheduled to make a   speech on the first night of the Republican National Convention.  Trump’s four adult children are also slated to speak this week, with the presumptive Republican nominee due to deliver Thursday night’s featured address.
