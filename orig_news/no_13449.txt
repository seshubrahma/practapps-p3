Daniel Horowitz at Conservative Review argues that both Donald Trump and Marco Rubio are guilty of favoring cheap foreign workers instead of hiring Americans. [From Conservative Review:  What is remarkable about the 2016 presidential election process thus far is the sheer volume of important questions that have not been asked. While the leftist media is busy asking candidates about their shoes, the things the American people should know —  indeed, need to know —  before they vote in the primaries and again in the fall never seem to come up. In keeping with this pattern of discussing nonsense over substance, two of the candidates running for the Republican presidential nomination, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump, have never been asked to fully explain their position on foreign workers: Why do they both support the importation and use of cheap foreign labor, and the displacement of American employees? While Rubio is widely known for his comprehensive amnesty bill, his name is also on another atrocious and much more recent immigration bill. He has yet to be asked about it at a debate or in any major forum on the campaign trail. In January 2015, Rubio joined Senator Orrin Hatch ( ) as an original   of a bill that is deceptively named the Immigration Innovation (or " ") Act. The only original thing about this bill is that its supporters have innovatively prevented the American people from noticing how economically destructive it would be if it ever became law.   …     Trump’s campaign has lobbed fire at Rubio for the latter’s unapologetic,   support for the   program generally and the   Act specifically.  But Trump himself has used quite a few foreign visa programs in his day to hire cheaper foreign workers instead of Americans, and he needs to be asked about that as well.
