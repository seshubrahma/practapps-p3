 (CNN) Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by six points, 44% to 38% in a Fox News poll of registered voters released Wednesday, marking an uptick from similar polls released in May and June. The Fox News results follow a rough patch for the Trump campaign: In May, the presumptive Republican nominee enjoyed a   lead in the same survey. But by early June, those numbers had flipped, with Clinton jumping out to a 42% to 39% advantage. CNN’s Poll of Polls    an average of results for the five most recent publicly released national polls that meet CNN’s standards for publication    has Clinton leading Trump 46% to 40%. Her lead among women in this latest round    51% to 32%    outpaces Trump’s with men, where his edge has dwindled to 10 points, 46% to 36%. The state of the race remains essentially unchanged when Libertarian Gary Johnson is thrown into the mix. Johnson wins 10% of the vote in a   competition, taking about equally from Trump and Clinton, whose lead scales down to 41% to 36%. Despite having seen off his last primary rival nearly eight weeks ago, Trump also lags behind Clinton on the party unity front. His lead among Republicans is down to 74% from 82% in May. And only 52% of registered GOP voters who had previously supported one of his opponents picked the billionaire businessman over Clinton. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders voters appear more willing to shed their primary loyalties and back the party’s likely nominee.   of the Sanders backers surveyed said they would vote for Clinton over Trump. Overall, 83% of Democrats plan to support Clinton in November. The Fox News’ poll was conducted between June 26 and 28 among 1, 017 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide, and has a margin of error of    3 percentage points.
