Saturday in her "Opening Statement," Fox News Channel’s "Justice" host Judge Jeanine Pirro fought back tears as she discussed Donald Trump being elected as the next president.  Pirro, noting how Trump supporters were shamed for supporting the   called Trump’s victory a revolution in a time where "truth and honesty had no place" in this politically correct society. "As for the campaign itself, they told you you didn’t matter, that if you supported him you were probably uneducated,   and irrelevant," Pirro said. "You were beneath them. That if you wanted closed boarders, a nation state you weren’t Christian enough, not American enough, not   enough, That if you didn’t see racism in every cop who walked the beat, you probably were a racist yourself. That if you used the term ‘Muslim Jihadist’ instead of terrorist you were an   bigot. Truth and honesty had no place in their politically correct society. If you opposed sanctuary cities where the protection of illegal criminal immigrants was the law, you were a hateful bigoted xenophobe. They knew better than you. " She added, "In spite of it all, even though we felt forgotten, alone and beaten down, we all came home because this wasn’t an election  —   it was a revolution.
