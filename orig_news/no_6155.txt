"Expect that we are peaceful and   citizens," Dooley said. Bikers for Trump 2020 also showed up to support the fake news protest. Founder Chris Cox said CNN and other liberal media outlets are guilty of "journalistic malpractice on a daily basis.

" "We are a beacon of light and freedom to the rest of the world," the woman declared. Another man said the hateful rhetoric toward the president and conservatives can lead to incidents like the one on Wednesday when a man opened fired on congressional Republicans as they held a baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia.
