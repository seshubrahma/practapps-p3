Thursday on "The Mike Gallagher Show," presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he would "love" Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) to be chosen as presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s running mate.  Trump said, "I would love it. I don’t think she will do it. I don’t think that Hillary Clinton, ‘Crooked Hillary,’ as I call her, would do it. But I would love to see that. I think that would be the best thing that could happen. She is despised. She is a   senator. You know she is all talk. She has passed nothing. She is not respected by many of her colleagues. And I will tell you she is a total  . She hasn’t done anything. You know she talks a good game. And she used her Native American  —   so called phony Native America status to get into institutions and to help her career. " "I always say I have more Native American blood in me than she does, OK?" he continued. "And I bet you do too. I think it’s a total ruse. And she kept Native Americans out of the colleges  …     She kept somebody out and she claimed she was Native American, and had she not have been she wouldn’t have gotten into those institutions  —   either schooling or working  —   but she wouldn’t have gotten into those institutions. She has no documentation. She has no documentation whatsoever mind you. It’s a disgrace. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
