From Catherine Thompson writing at Talking Points Memo: For years, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) has been dogged by a backburner controversy about whether he is eligible to serve as President since he was born in Calgary, Alberta Canada in 1970. But since Cruz’s mother was an American citizen, the place of his birth actually is irrelevant to his eligibility. Yet Cruz’s mother’s name appears on a Canadian government document, obtained by TPM in 2013, that lists Canadian citizens eligible to vote in 1974. TPM shared an electronic copy of the document with Sen. Cruz’s office when it originally obtained the document in 2013. Cruz’s   director, Sean Rushton, emphasized that the document is not a record of people who actually voted in any election. He further pointed out that the document itself provides notice that "applications for corrections," "deletions from," and "additions to" the list may have been necessary. "At least one other error is evident on its face: the name of Sen. Cruz’s father is misspelled," Rushton told TPM in his 2013 statement. "Regardless, Mrs. Cruz has never been a Canadian citizen, and she has never voted in any Canadian election. " TPM eventually decided not to publish an article based on the document at the time, in part because Cruz was not yet a candidate for president. TPM decided to revisit the story earlier this week as rival Donald Trump renewed his skepticism about Cruz’s eligibility, moving the story to the center of the campaign, and was prepared to publish this evening.
