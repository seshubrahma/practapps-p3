According to a WFLA report, a Hillsborough County, FL home was set on fire in what appears to be related to the results of the 2016 election.  Hillsborough County   crews reportedly got a call about a fire around 1:20 a. m. When they arrived, the house was still on fire. The house next door had "F*** Trump"   on the side, as well as "BLM" above an arrow pointing in the direction of the burning home, likely a nod at Black Lives Matter. The fire was put out quickly, and the report says there was no visible damage on the outside of the house. Both homes are believed to be vacant, so nobody was hurt. A neighbor, however, was a bit shaken up. "I was just truly broken  —   heartbroken," neighbor Anna Foster said.  "I feel like this is not gonna be a good four years.  We’re gonna have a civil war if this keeps on.  Just nonsense. " "You can’t live around this," she added.  "It’s very scary.  We need authority.  We need control.
