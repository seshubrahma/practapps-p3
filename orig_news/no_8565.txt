Monday in an appearance Fox News Channel’s "On the Record," former House Speaker Newt Gingrich commented on the intense scrutiny Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has faced over the past several days and said "80 percent of the elite media" were working against Trump.  Gingrich pointed to the indiscretions from his opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and noted they have gotten little coverage, whereas Trump has been under a heightened scrutiny. "She’s lying about   thousand emails," he said. "She’s lying about national security. Why shouldn’t she apologize? If Donald Trump owes anybody an apology, how come Hillary doesn’t owe the whole country an apology?" "Trump’s stubborn," he added. "But he didn’t delete 33, 000 emails. Trump didn’t send out secret information. Trump didn’t lie about the FBI. Hillary did all that stuff. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
