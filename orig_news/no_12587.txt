Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been restored after it was destroyed in a   attack last month  —   and according to one report, the star is getting    protection to prevent further vandalism. [Law enforcement sources told TMZ this week that two Los Angeles Police Department officers and at least one vehicle will patrol the area around Trump’s star 24 hours a day, in what the outlet described as a "Secret Service" level of protection.

In late October, just days before the election, a homeless woman guarding the star from   vandals was harassed and assaulted by a group of   protesters.
