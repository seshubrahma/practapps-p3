Pollster Pat Caddell believes that victory in the 2016 election is in the hands of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, saying on Monday, "This really is Trump’s election if he wants to win it. "["It’s in his hands," Caddell told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily. "We still have not seen the rise of the refugee issue, which the Breitbart Gravis polls shows has emerged as a major issue. "  Caddell also cited immigration as another issue on which Trump can win, if he emphasizes it: "That has yet to be raised as an issue. " "The most important thing is, it’s not done. This election is still in huge flux, partly because we have, as we have seen in the Breitbart polls  …     close to a quarter of voters who are unfavorable to both candidates," he said. "And those voters swing back and forth. What’s going to determine this election is, what happens with them, because they are the most volatile of the electorate. " "The dynamics here are fluid," he added. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. EST. LISTEN:
