(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The Democratic presidential race grew more bruising for the party itself. Bernie Sanders’s campaign manager accused a top Democratic official of working against the candidate "for personal reasons. " Some of his supporters threatened to back Donald Trump if Hillary Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee. Mr. Trump piled on, gleefully tweeting that Mr. Sanders was being "treated very badly," and adding, "The system is rigged against him. " ____ 2. Mr. Trump tried to address concerns within the Republican Party that he is not a conservative, releasing a list of 11 potential Supreme Court nominees that included several who are favorites of conservative legal scholars. One of our   stories today offers a detailed look at five crucial weeks of Mr. Trump’s campaign, during which he transitioned from a seemingly unelectable candidate to the de facto Republican nominee. ____ 3. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, denounced the "shocking new dimension of doping. " He said Russian sports federations could be barred from the Rio Olympics if allegations of   doping prove true. "We will apply our zero tolerance policy, not only with regard to the athletes but also with regard to everybody implicated and within our reach," he said. ____ 4. The Labor Department issued a new regulation that will enable millions more workers to make overtime. As of Dec. 1, most salaried workers who earn up to $47, 476 annually will get time and a half for any labor over 40 hours a week. That will include a far wider range of work than before. The previous cutoff, set in 2004, was $23, 660. ____ 5. Robin Wright became the latest actress to openly address pay disparities in the entertainment industry. She said she had taken a hard line with the producers of the Netflix series "House of Cards" after she learned that her character was as popular as that of her     Kevin Spacey. "You better pay me or I’m going to go public," she said she told them, adding, "And they did. " ____ 6. The Asian monsoon season, primed by the El Niño phenomenon, opened with a disaster in Sri Lanka. Torrential rains set off landslides and flash floods that displaced hundreds of thousands of people. A death toll in the dozens is expected to rise. ____ 7. A Nigerian schoolgirl who was taken in a mass kidnapping by Boko Haram more than two years ago was found and returned to her town, Chibok. Now the mother of a    she is the first girl to be recovered since the early days of the episode. "She was so happy to see her people," a Chibok resident said. "People were so happy, so happy that, yes, there is hope these girls are alive. ____ 8. New Jersey closed one of its most notorious cold cases, convicting this woman of murder 25 years after her    son disappeared. A bit of blue blanket found with his remains was the key. Investigators recently went back and found three people who could testify that the blanket was from the boy’s home, allowing prosecutors to draw the damning connection. ____ 9. Paul Simon went back on tour, promoting his "Stranger to Stranger" album, which goes on sale June 3. Our critic says the    artist is making some of the strangest, most intriguing music of his career. Songs "crack jokes and ponder questions about love, death, spirituality, baseball, economic inequality, brain chemistry and music itself. " ____ 10. Finally, good news. Despite reports to the contrary in China’s media, this    panda is just fine. The Taipei Zoo posted its proof  —   the bear with current newspapers  —   on Facebook. "Tuan Tuan says: What more do you need?" the zoo’s caption reads. "Please don’t believe online rumors. Friends who care about Tuan Tuan don’t need to worry.
