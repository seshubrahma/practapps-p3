Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump disclosed to the press that he and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan spoke on Wednesday night after reports surfaced earlier in the day that Ryan was ready to endorse Trump. ["I spoke with Paul Ryan last night," Trump told reporters at a press conference in Bismarck, North Dakota on Thursday afternoon. "We had a very good talk," Trump added, saying everything is moving in the right direction.  "We’ll see what happens," Trump said when asked if he would concede on any policy issues to unite with Ryan. On Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, news reports surfaced that Ryan was ready to endorse Trump, but Ryan’s spokesperson later denied those reports.
