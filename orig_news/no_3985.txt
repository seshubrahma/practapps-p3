" "The attention that this part of the world has got from people back home is probably no surprise," he continued.

He remarked to the room: "I stand before you today very moved this Eastern Sunday, because one of those soldiers more than sixty years ago was my dad. As we landed today on the peninsula I looked out at those rolling hills and I thought about second lieutenant Edward J Pence who was with the 45th infantry division of the United States Army that served here in combat. " He went on to say: "On this day I think of my dad. He’s been gone 29 years now and is still enshrined in the hearts of everyone in our family. And I think of what dad would be thinking about and I believe he is thinking about, as he looks down to see his third son return to that place he left so many years ago, and to see that the sacrifices that were made, the commitment that endures here as a result of a free and prosperous South Korea. " We are so thankful for the blessing of these incredible patriots, and it was a privilege for Karen  me to spend Easter with them. #VPinASIA pic. twitter.   —   Vice President Pence (@VP) April 16, 2017,  Proud to represent @POTUS  the U.
