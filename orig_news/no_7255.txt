Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said that he is voting for Ted Cruz in Tuesday’s Indiana primary, but he also praised Donald Trump and pledged to work for him on the campaign trail if Trump wins. [Pence said in an Indianapolis radio interview with Greg Garrison, host of the Garrison show on Indianapolis radio station WIBC, that he is "grateful" for Trump’s economic campaign themes.  "I like and respect all three of the Republican candidates in the field," Pence said: I particularly want to commend Donald Trump who I think has given voice to the frustration of millions of working Americans with the lack of progress in Washington, D. C. And I’m also particularly grateful that Donald Trump has taken a strong stand for Hoosier jobs. When we saw the Carrier company announce that it’s leaving Indiana not for another state but for Mexico. I’m grateful. I’m grateful for his voice in the national debate. Pence is not going to campaign hard and negatively against Cruz’s rivals like Marco Rubio supporter Gov. Nikki Haley did in South Carolina. "I’m not against anybody but I will be voting for Ted Cruz in the upcoming Republican primary," Pence said. "Let me be very, very clear on this, Greg. Whoever wins the Republican nomination for president of the United States I’m going to work my heart out to get elected this fall. " Pence stressed the need for the new president to help states grow their economies. "Indiana needs a partner in the White House in our prosperity," Pence said, noting strong Indiana economic signs but lamenting, "How much more we could do if we had a Republican administration working with a Republican Congress. I get very excited about Indiana here in our bicentennial year. The potential in our third century if we have someone in Washington, D. C. working for us instead of against us. "
