 (CNN) Alec Baldwin might be hanging up his fake tan and red tie.  The actor tells "Extra" he thinks viewers may tire of his portrayal of President Trump on "Saturday Night Live." "His policies aside, which you can hate, I thought he would have just relaxed," Baldwin says. "The maliciousness of this White House has people worried. . .. That’s why I’m not going to do it much longer, the impersonation, I don’t know how much more people can take it." Baldwin adds: "Trump just overwhelmingly lacks any sportsmanship, he remains bitter and angry, and you just want to look at him and go, ’You won! ’" Related: Baldwin gets ’SNL’ its biggest ratings in six years, outdraws Trump’s host stint, It’s not clear how long ’SNL’ plans to have Baldwin play Trump.

I think they may have a whole other idea."
