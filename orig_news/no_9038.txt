During his campaign rally Sunday, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump doubled down on his comments that waterboarding is a useful interrogation technique. ["We are living in medieval times," Trump told his supporters in New Hampshire, referencing Islamic terrorists. "There’s never been a time like this. Medieval times, they chop your head off. Even in the Wild West, you’d get shot, but they didn’t chop your head off. "  During the GOP primary debate on Saturday night, Trump said he would do "a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding" to captured terrorists. "Mr. Trump, you said not only does it work, but that you’d bring it back," the real estate mogul was asked during the debate. "Well, I’ll tell you what. In the Middle East, we have people chopping the heads off Christians," Trump began, then added:  We have people chopping the heads off many other people. We have things that we have never seen before. As a group, we have never seen before what’s happening right now.   …     I mean, we studied medieval times not since medieval times have people seen what’s going on. I would bring back waterboarding, and I’d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.
