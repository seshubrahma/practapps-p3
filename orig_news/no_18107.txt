’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’     Insofar that normal people watch congressional hearings, any     casual viewer would have read this as confirmation of election     "hacking" and undue influence from the Russian government. But     President Trump, perhaps interested in shaping the narrative of     this hearing and investigation, offered a different     interpretation on Twitter, through the official POTUS account.     "The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence     the electoral process,"  adding a brief clip of     the hearing for readers to watch.   ’ ’     This wasn’t true. In that clip, Rep. Devin Nunes, chair of the     Intelligence Committee, asked Adm. Mike Rogers, the director     the National Security Agency, if he had any evidence that     Russia tampered with vote totals in the state of Michigan.     Rogers answered no. Nunes then asked the same question for the     states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, and     Ohio —  all swing states in the presidential election.   ’ ’  ’ ’     Rogers, again, answered in the negative. "I have nothing     generated by the National Security Agency," he said. Comey     answers similarly, telling Nunes there’s no evidence from the     FBI that the Russian government had tampered with actual votes.   ’ ’       In fact, conspiracy theorists  no one argues otherwise. The actual       allegation is more limited: That, as ranking Democrat Adam       Schiff asserted in his  to the       committee, "A foreign, adversarial power intervened in an       effort to weaken our democracy, and to influence the outcome       for one candidate and against the other. "     ’ ’       That intervention, Schiff argued, was hacked data,       "weaponized" and disseminated through "existing         channels like WikiLeaks. " To deny   in other       words, is not to preclude outside interference. Nunes’       questioning is besides the point, and Trump’s interpretation       of that questioning is dishonest.     ’ ’       This lying was so brazen that it almost overshadowed  from Trump’s earlier claim that President       Obama had "wiretapped" him during the campaign. "With respect       to the president’s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed       at him by the prior administration, I have no information       that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully       inside the FBI," said Comey.     ’ ’       Likewise, said Rogers, "We know there was not a wiretap on       Trump Tower. However, it’s still possible that other       surveillance activities were used against President Trump and       his associates. " In fact, the election lie was so brazen that       Comey was asked to refute it in real time, which he       .     ’ ’  ’ ’       Thus far, in the past few weeks, Trump has forced American       intelligence agencies to investigate a conspiracy theory with       almost no basis in fact, while using his platform to       discredit an actual inquiry into his campaign and       administration.     ’ ’       He’s  an allied       government of surveillance, and if recent reporting is any       indication, he is convinced of the reality of a wiretapping       plot, despite all evidence to the contrary. It’s       extraordinary behavior, compounded by the fact that Trump       lies with unprecedented ease and frequency.     ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’It’s difficult to describe the feeling of. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
