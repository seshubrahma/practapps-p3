Thursday on Fox News Channel’s  "Fox  Friends,"   Donald Trump’s senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said White House press secretary Josh Earnest’s claim yesterday at the daily press briefing that Trump that knew about Russia hacking the 2016 presidential election was "incredibly irresponsible. "  Wednesday Earnest said Trump was "obviously aware" of the Russian interference when referencing Trump’s joke during a campaign rally inviting Russian hackers to find Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s missing  emails. Conway said, "That is just remarkable. That is breathtaking. I guess he’s auditioning to be a political pundit after his job is over soon. That is incredibly disappointing to hear from the podium of the White House press secretary. Because he basically  —   he essentially stated that the   had knowledge of this, maybe even fanned the flames. It’s incredibly irresponsible and I wonder if his boss, president Obama agrees.
