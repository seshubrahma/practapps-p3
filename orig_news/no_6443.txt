The polls have closed in Georgiaâ€™s Sixth Congressional district for the special election between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel. [The special election has turned out to be the most expensive in U. S. history, with each side pouring in tens of millions of dollars to back their particular candidate as Democrats see a potential   and Republicans see an opportunity to hold off the left once and for all in the era of President Donald Trump.  President Trump has urged his supporters in Georgia to turn out in a series of Tweets, including one on Tuesday morning: KAREN HANDEL FOR CONGRESS. She will fight for lower taxes, great healthcare strong   hard worker who will never give up! VOTE TODAY,  â€”   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 20, 2017,  The race comes in a district left open by former Rep. Tom Price ( ) who vacated the seat when he became President Trumpâ€™s Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary. President Trump won the traditionally Republican district narrowly in November against Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News the day before the election, Handel told senior editor Joel Pollak that she expects to win. "There has definitely been a significant bias from the local media like nothing like I have ever experienced," Handel said. "But I intend to have the last laugh when I win tomorrow. " Ossoff, in an interview on election day with CNN, called Handel a "career politician" and contrasted that with himself who he says is "a fresh voice who wants to work across the aisle to get things done to grow our economy, work to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for women and folks with   conditions. " Ossoff also said "clearly there is a lot of national interest," but that he will "leave it to the pundits â€”  the folks at CNN â€”  to assess the national implications. " Final polls in the district have shown a race that has come down to the wire, and it remains to be seen who won. Now, as of 7 p. m. ET in the suburban Atlanta district, the polls have closed. Follow along with Breitbart News in this livewire as the results will begin trickling in soon. ********* UPDATES BELOW ********* Last Laugh:  She called it. @KarenHandel gets the last laugh.

Ossoff ran the Democratsâ€™ playbook for 2018, with his "Make Trump Furious" campaign and all of the Democrat and "Resistance" resources at his disposal.

Top conservatives, including Americans for Limited Government president Rick Manning, say the takeaway from Handelâ€™s victory is that Republicans on Capitol Hill need to get with President Trumpâ€™s program and kickstart the Trump agenda now: "The Georgia Congressional race should serve as a   call for the GOP in Washington, D. C. to get to work on President Trumpâ€™s agenda," Manning said in a statement. "The   rope a dope strategy where they spend more time on vacation than doing the peopleâ€™s business will lead to catastrophic results in November of 2018. Speaker Ryan should immediately cancel the August recess and move aggressively forward on the Presidentâ€™s agenda with an emphasis on economic growth measures, including laying the groundwork for tax cuts, turning the Presidentâ€™s infrastructure plan into legislation and sending it to the Senate, and cutting the budget in accordance with the Trump budget. The House of Representatives is not saddled with the filibuster and the GOP Conference needs to be aggressive in passing limited government legislation across Capitol Hill to the Senate.

Senators from Georgia. She thanked Speaker Paul Ryan and House GOP leadership. "And a special thanks to the president of the United States of America," she added to cheers of "TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!" from the audience, before adding as well: "But letâ€™s not forget our equally great vice president, Mike Pence. " Handel also gave a   to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who was shot in a GOP baseball practice before the congressional baseball game last week. She said Scalise and her were in constant communication until his shooting, and that Scalise called her the "terminator" in a text message. She said the shooting was a "tragedy. " "We need to find a more civil way to deal with our disagreement because in these United States of America no one  â€”   no one  â€”   should ever feel their life threatened over their political beliefs and positions," Handel said. "And I say that, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to both sides of the political aisle.

Her 52. 6 percent with 96, 130 votes leads Ossoffâ€™s 47. 4 percent with 86, 531 votes, per Decision Desk HQ. Not good for Democrats right now. Our Democrat friend at Ossoffâ€™s HQ tells us that "I love the sofa pundits on Twitter who are saying the Dem Party is done if we lose. This district wasnâ€™t even supposed to be in play. The fact that we are playing it close in deep red districts should make them [worry] heading into 2018. " But Ossoff being down 6 points in Fulton County is not a good spot to be. UPDATE 9:10 P. M. Still waiting for   ballots in Georgia: Karen Handel is up by almost 4, 000 votes right now.

Handelâ€™s lead in the latest returns has gotten a bit wider, as sheâ€™s now at 51. 4 percent with 78, 574 votes to Ossoffâ€™s 48. 6 percent with 74, 276 votes. That      lead is still tight and this is not over yet. UPDATE 8:54 P. M.

Itâ€™s more about health care.  â€”   Symone D. Sanders (@SymoneDSanders) June 20, 2017,  So does that mean if Handel wins that Democrats in red states will support efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, or is that just more spin? UPDATE 8:37 P. M. Handel has now taken a two point lead per Decision Desk HQ returns numbers, up 51 percent to 49 percent over Ossoff. Her 70, 815 votes are a couple grand better than his 68, 147 votes. UPDATE 8:31 P. M. The most up to date numbers we can find have Handel in the lead, with 68, 661 votes and 50. 7 percent of the vote, as compared with Ossoffâ€™s 49. 3 percent and 66, 669 votes. Those are on Decision Desk HQ. UPDATE 8:27 P. M. Both Dana Bash and Anderson Cooper, on CNN, say President Trump has every right to take a victory lap if Karen Handel wins. UPDATE 8:25 P. M. Now it seems the results are fluctuating,. CNN is reporting a minor lead for Ossoff. We hear from Ossoffâ€™s headquarters people are cheering the results, and chanting "FLIP THE 6th!" CNNâ€™s numbers have Ossoff with 58, 152 votes and Handel with 56, 619 votes.

With a little more than 126, 000 votes in, Handel still leads with 50. 4 percent of the vote to Ossoffâ€™s 49. 6 percent. Our Democrat friend whoâ€™s supporting Ossoff tells us that the the person who did the best outreach to seniors likely will win. UPDATE 8:12 P. M. Hereâ€™s the spin to expect from the left if Handel wins, from a Democrat whoâ€™s supporting Ossoff tonight who spoke to Breitbart News on condition of anonymity from the Ossoff party via phone: Democrats believe now they can be competitive in red states and district if they fight, Ossoff won more votes than Democrats historically do in this district, and Ossoff to win the seat needed to avoid the runoff to begin with. Not a good sign for them right now, but again itâ€™s still early. UPDATE 8:10 P. M. Not looking good for Democrats at all tonight: . @Karen Handel says early returns  showing her leading Ossoff in 6th District Congressional Runoff a good first sign @FOX5Atlanta #fox5atl,  â€”   Deidra Dukes (@DeidraDukesFOX5) June 21, 2017,  Well thatâ€™s a bit unexpected.

Hill (@Harlan) June 21, 2017,    UPDATE 7:58 P. M.  Itâ€™s by no means over. This could swing either way based off these early returns: Right now the NYT tracker is saying, based on counted votes, that we should end up between Ossoff by 6. 5 and Handel by 8.

The Root reporter Jason Johnson, reporting on MSNBC live from Ossoffâ€™s headquarters, is already predicting a Handel win tonight. If she does pull it off, expect the left and media to go absolutely bonkers. UPDATE 7:50 P. M. Nate Cohn seems to think earliest returns show good signs for Handel, but this is by no means over. Handel wins the   early vote in Fulton â€”  thatâ€™s not a bad sign for her.  â€”   Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) June 20, 2017,  Remember, of course, that thereâ€™s a degree of fungibility in all of this. Does it mean Dems do even better in mail (where Dems are best?)  â€”   Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) June 20, 2017,  UPDATE 7:45 P. M. And, wouldnâ€™t you know, we now have some results per Decision Desk HQ. Handel has an early edge of 3 percent, as sheâ€™s up with 51. 5 percent to Ossoffâ€™s 48. 5 percent. Of the 72, 691 votes in, Handel has 37, 435 votes and Ossoff has 35, 256 votes. MSNBCâ€™s Chris Matthews notes that Handel is expected to do well in the area thatâ€™s reporting, Fulton County, so this is not surprising sheâ€™s out to an early lead. UPDATE 7:41 P. M.  Even the Democrats now privately think Handel will beat Ossoff, barely. But nobody is confident: Folks on both sides of   privately, think that Handel is gonna win by a hair tonight. But neither side very confident.  â€”   Reid J. Epstein (@reidepstein) June 20, 2017,  Democrats have called Breitbart News throughout the day to independently confirm this sentiment, too.
