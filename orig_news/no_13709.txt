Hillary Clinton is not worried about facing Donald Trump in the general election, she insists, citing her experience dealing with controversial men. ["I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak," Clinton said in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on The Lead. "I’m not going to deal with their temper tantrums or their bullying or their efforts to try to provoke me. "  Clinton did not name the men she was referring to but indicated she was tough enough to handle Trump’s bombastic attacks. "He can say whatever he wants to say about me, I could really care less," she said, obviously looking forward to the general election. I’m going to stand up for what I think the American people need and want in the next president. " The full interview will be broadcast on CNN later this afternoon.
