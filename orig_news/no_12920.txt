On Monday’s "The Herd" on Fox Sports 1, host Colin Cowherd likened the "mess" that is the NFL’s American Football Conference playoff teams to the GOP presidential candidates.  According to Cowherd, presidential candidates Jeb Bush, Dr. Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump can all be compared to AFC playoff teams Kansas Chiefs, Denver Broncos, Pittsburgh Steelers, Houston Texans, Cincinnati Bengals and the New England Patriots. He explained that the AFC favorites, whose quarterback happens to be close with Trump, are Donald Trump because they have "issues," but are "polarizing" and "pretty teflon. " "It’s like when I watch all these political debates and I watch the GOP right now, Kansas City is Jeb Bush. Nice, reasonably effective, but boring, low energy. Denver is Ben Carson. About two months ago I was into it, but just too much strange for me. Pittsburgh is Chris Christie. Fun, dynamic, but can’t get out of its own way. Houston is Mike Huckabee. Please, no shot. Bengals are Marco Rubio. You can see the talent, but they don’t feel quite ready yet to win big. And that leaves me with the New England Patriots. I think they’re Donald Trump. Issues, polarizing, but pretty teflon. " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
