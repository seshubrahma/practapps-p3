Washington (CNN) Inauguration planners rushed to wipe away a potential controversy Friday after   on the National Mall happened to be adorned with the  ’s first name. Workers were spotted Friday morning covering the "Don’s Johns" logo with blue masking tape. It’s unclear who was responsible for the taping, but Don’s Johns Chief Operating Officer Rob Weghorst is not happy.  "We have no idea who’s doing the taping," he told CNN. "Someone did this and now we have to send people down to take it off." Weghorst expects his team, already working hard in light of the inaugural festivities for which they have been contracted, will remove the tape over the weekend. A statement from the Architect of the Capitol on Monday explained what happened.   "The AOC is covering or removing signage on the portable toilets to bring them into compliance with Capitol Grounds restrictions on advertising," the statement said. "Our staff determined that the Gene’s Johns signs can be easily peeled off. The Don’s Johns signs cannot and are being covered with tape." Trump, whose middle name is John, will be inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States at the US Capitol next Friday, an event expected to draw thousands of onlookers onto the National Mall who will use the facilities, of which there are about 2, 000, according to Weghorst. The company is the   provider of sanitation services in the Washington area.  "Don’s Johns’ long history of quality service has provided a loyal customer base which has made Don’s Johns the first name when it comes to a portable toilet rental within our region," their website reads.
