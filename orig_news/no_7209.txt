Law enforcement sources now say that a computer system used by the Clinton campaign have been attacked as part of a system hack of the Democratic National Committee. [But the incident does not appear to involve Clinton campaign email. According to Reuters, an analytics data program built by the DNC and used by the campaign had been compromised. A federal law enforcement source confirmed the news to the New York Times.   In a statement, Clinton campaign spokesperson Nick Merrill confirmed the hack of the program. "An analytics data program maintained by the DNC, and used by our campaign and a number of other entities, was accessed as part of the DNC hack," he said in a statement to reporters. But the Clinton campaign argued that their computer systems remain secure. "Our campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts. To date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised. " So far, all of the sources detailing the hack remain anonymous law enforcement officials. After Trump jokingly asked the Russians to release Hillary Clinton’s deleted personal emails, Clinton’s campaign criticized him for endangering national security by inciting espionage. Hackers have also breached the network of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, according to Reuters.
