Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s childhood home in Queens, New York goes on the auction block in October, and Inside Edition took a tour of the home this week for a segment on the program. [The location of the house, at   Wareham Road in Jamaica Estates, is reportedly listed on Trump’s birth certificate.   "Trump used to live here. Some may love it, some may hate it. It is what it is," auctioneer Misha Haghani told Inside Edition. Realtor Howard Kaminowitz told the program that the name of Trump’s father, Fred Trump, is emblazoned in the wood underneath the door frame, as it is with many of the properties he built. The   Tudor will be put up for auction on October 19 with a starting price of $849, 000. Watch Inside Edition‘s tour of the home’s interior in the video above.
