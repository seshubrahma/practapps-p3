Thursday on Fox News Channel’s "Hannity," Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus weighed in on the    between likely presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan.  Earlier in the day in an interview with CNN, Ryan said he was "not yet" ready to support Trump’s candidacy for the White House. Trump fired back in a statement and said he wasn’t yet ready to support Ryan’s agenda. Priebus said that Trump and Ryan are slated to meet next week and will "talk about these things," and he added he anticipated things will ultimately "work out. " "I talked to him this afternoon after he made his comments," Priebus said. "And I talked to Donald Trump, too. And they’re both committed to sitting down and actually talking this out and actually, they’re likely to be meeting next week. " "Both Donald Trump and Paul Ryan are meeting next week to talk about these things," Priebus said. "I think it’s going to work out, but you know, in some cases, people are not going to be instantly on board. I know that can be frustrating for some people, but I think everyone has to allow a little bit of the steam to get out and get everyone to settle down, and I think that this is going to come together.
