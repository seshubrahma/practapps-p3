Police have closed portions of uptown Charlotte on Wednesday night after a series of gunshots were fired. One man has reportedly been shot. [There are conflicting reports as to whether the protester who was shot is dead or alive.  The protests are the second night where the North Carolina city has erupted after a man, Keith Lamont Scott, was shot by police after he allegedly was carrying a gun. Some have —  mistakenly according to police —  believed that Scott had a book, not a gun, in his vehicle when a police officer shot him. But authorities have said that they confiscated a gun —  and didn’t find a book —  in the vehicle. The first night of protests saw many police officers injured, and now this second night has seen a protester shot —  according to police by another protester. The crowd is protesting the Tuesday, Sept. 20 police shooting of Keith Lamont Smith. Police say he was shot and killed after he produced a gun during a meeting with police. Local activists say Smith was shot outside his car while holding a book, and that he was no danger to the police because he was disabled. This is the second round of street protests, which broke out Wednesday night. Breitbart News is reporting the news from protests as it happens. Follow along here for live updates: UPDATE 9:03 A. M.

M. This video from a Facebook user appears to show the scene where a gunshot was fired. Toward the end of the clip, a loud shot is heard and then the person shooting the video starts moving away quickly from the scene. UPDATE 12:50 A. M.  Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, just announced through a Democratic National Committee press release —  without any explanation —  that a press call Democrats had planned to work with the black community is now canceled. "Hillary Clinton knows that HBCUs are an engine of opportunity for students of color and that they have made huge contributions our country. She understands the long standing significance of HBCUs for black students and their families and has real policies to address college affordability and ensure that HBCUs not only survive  —   but thrive," the Democratic National Committee had previously said in an announcement of a press call. "By contrast, Donald Trump has no plans, and he has only insults for the   community. He trafficks in offensive stereotypes, talks down to African Americans day after day on the campaign trail, and wants to eliminate the Department of Education, which would mean eliminating college aid for millions of students, including HBCU enrollees. " The press call was supposed to include Assistant Democratic House Leader Rep. Jim Clyburn ( ) Rep. Alma Adams ( ) and DC Federation of College Democrats President Adriyanna Andreus. Shortly after midnight —  after Governor McCrory declared a state of emergency in Charlotte —  the DNC announced without any explanation that the Clinton campaign press call was canceled. "  *THE FOLLOWING EVENT HAS BEEN POSTPONED*" the DNC said in an email to press. That comes after Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, earlier on Wednesday taped a townhall event in Cleveland with Fox News’ Sean Hannity where Trump laid out his plans to deal with issues for America’s black communities.

Breitbart News’ Jen Lawrence files this report after speaking to people on the ground: Charlotte resident Clay Banks was about twenty feet away when a man was shot during Wednesday night’s protest. Banks described to Breitbart News what he says began as a peaceful protest uptown: "It was very, very civil. People were in the streets. They were walking, marching. They were holding up signs. They were chanting. And the police were just on guard. The police were in the city  …     some had riot gear on. " But then things took a turn for the worse. "The peaceful protests lasted for about an hour until there were flash bangs and tear gas launched into the crowd," Banks continued. "The first bang that I heard, sounded like a flash bang. About five minutes later people were saying a man was shot and they were saying he was dead. And they were saying they watched it happen. And this was all about twenty feet from me. And, later the news confirmed the man was shot and killed. " Banks went on to talk about the confusion in the crowd that ensued as word of the shooting spread. "The people who talked to me said this was a cop that shot the man dead. The media is saying that it was a    shooting," he said. "There is a conflict in what people are saying. " When asked if there were signs of anything that would have led up to a shooting, Banks responded "No, no  …     a couple slick people in the crowd were yelling louder than others, but there [were] no bricks through windows. There was nothing to warrant a shooting especially a legal shooting [by law enforcement of] a civilian. Nothing like that transpired at all. I was literally right there. " UPDATE 12:13 A. M. CNN’s Don Lemon describes it as a "peaceful protest that turned violent. " Lemon says that the protesters are really "rioting this evening.
