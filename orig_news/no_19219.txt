’  ’ ’   Professional athletes are  to criticize Donald Trump for lewd 2005   comments he has excused by chalking up to "    talk," saying almost uniformly that they have never heard   anything similar in any of their locker rooms. ’ "   One former NBA player, John Amaechi, was particularly critical of   Trump’s words, going so far as to reveal what exactly would   happen within a locker room if someone spoke so candidly about   sexual violence.  " ’   Amaechi, who played in the NBA from 1995 to 2003 for the   Cavaliers, Jazz, and Magic, appeared on NPR’’s "Fresh Air" Monday   and first explained what he and his teammates talked about.  ’ ’  ’ ’’ ’   And Amaechi added that anyone who did speak in a similar manner   as Trump would have immediately been reprimanded.  ’ ’  ’ ’   Trump, for his part, has doubled down on the "locker room"   explanation. During the second presidential debate, the   Republican nominee was questioned about his 2005 comments   and spent most of his answer to the question discussing   ISIS. ’
