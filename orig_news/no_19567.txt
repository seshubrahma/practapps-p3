’  ’ "   Billionaire businessman Mark Cuban provided an apt analogy for     Donald Trump on Wednesday: an NBA team’s top   draft pick.

"He’’s who we put our hopes and dreams with, and we’’re going   to believe in him. Right now it’’s a little bit easier because we   haven’’t played a game yet." ’ ’   "There’’s no reason to rush to judgment or come to any conclusions   now," he continued.

When pressed further,   he said they discussed "coffee." ’ ’ ’ ’Mark Cuban, asked about photo of him & Steve Bannon having coffee together, laughs and then veers off into another topic ’
