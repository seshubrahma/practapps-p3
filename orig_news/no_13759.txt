Sunday on CBS’s "Face the Nation," Rep. John Lewis ( ) said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump should apologize for questioning if President Obama was born in the United States.  Lewis said, "I thought it was shameful. Everybody, every reasonable person knew that he was born in America  —   in Hawaii, not in Kenya. And he just wouldn’t give up on it. And even now he’s not really apologizing or saying I’m sorry. When you make mistakes, when you’re wrong, you should admit you’re wrong, and ask people to forgive you.
