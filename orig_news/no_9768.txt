Tuesday at a campaign rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Democratic presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said of the policies of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, "You can put lipstick on a pig but it is still a pig. "  Clinton said, "They try to disguise the fact this they still are slashing taxes for the wealthy, large corporations and Donald Trump himself. they will try to use voodoo economics to tell us all the ways it will actually help the economy. They are not fooling anybody, at least I hope they are not. Just like his current plan, which he calls inspiring tremendous and amazing. You know he uses a lot of adjectives to avoid telling you any specifics. Here is what we know for sure. " "Whatever he comes out with next is going to give huge tax cuts to the corporation and the rich at the expense to the middle class," she continued. "There is that old saying, you can put lipstick on a pig but it is still a pig. I  have to tell you the first time the Republicans pull voodoo economics, they fooled us. Shame on them. But if they come back with the same argument and people fall for it, shame on us. I promise you this, Senator Sanders will spare no effort to make sure the people know Donald Trump and his cronies are trying to pull the wool over our eyes and come back with the same failed policies that hurt us before. We are not going to let them get away with this again. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
