Comedy Centralâ€™s Daily Show has been blasted on social media and accused of ridiculing transgender people after the showâ€™s official Twitter account cracked a joke about President Donald Trump transitioning into a woman. [The official Twitter account for the Trevor   show posted a message Wednesday asking viewers to pick what they thought Thursdayâ€™s biggest news headline would be.  The four hypothetical headlines were "Trump uses Constitution as a KFC napkin," "Comey drops a complete â€˜visual album,â€™" "Ivanka requests immunity," and "Donald Trump announces he is now Donna Trump. " The last joke apparently set off social media, as users wasted no time in ripping the Daily Show for making light of transgender transitioning. Some users noted the joke was particularly offensive because it was made on International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia  Biphobia. Of course the Daily Show ran a lazy transphobic joke on the Intl Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia   the day Chelsea is free,  â€”   Kevin Colbert (@kevinescent) May 18, 2017,  SNL used homophobia to "make fun" of trump and the Daily Show used transphobia today to the same ends. There must be a better way.  â€”   Broderick Greer (@BroderickGreer) May 18, 2017,  @TheDailyShow E: "The Daily Show celebrates International Day Against Transphobia with transphobic â€™jokeâ€™."  â€”   sharia lawful good (@hooper_x) May 17, 2017,  Repeat after me: gender identity is not a punchline https:  .   â€”   Kitson Smyth (@smyth_kitson) May 18, 2017,  @TheDailyShow Haha youâ€™re right daily show.

Speaking of the Daily Show and transphobia this from 2003 seems relevant. Also props to @Dennis_Kucinich pic. twitter.   â€”   Adam H. Johnson (@adamjohnsonNYC) May 18, 2017,  The showâ€™s official Twitter account has since deleted the joke. Neither the show nor its host Trevor Noah offered an immediate comment to address the situation.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson
