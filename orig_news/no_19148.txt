" ’   Chinese people see Trump as an "internet celebrity" on social   media, a phrase used to describe people who gained popularity   online by behaving in outlandish ways, and who oftentimes would   not be taken seriously. ’ ’   As Trump announced his candidacy last year, Chinese people   immediately gave him several nicknames, which all sound funny   with a disrespectful tone in Mandarin, mostly because, at the   time, they believed Trump was just a joke and had no chance of   winning White House. ’ ’   " " transliterated from "Trump," is an abbreviation of   "Sichuan Putonghua."
