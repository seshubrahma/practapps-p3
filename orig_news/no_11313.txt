Thursday on MSNBC’s "Andrea Mitchell Reports," Sen. Claire McCaskill ( ) said she did not believe Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump when he said his comments urging Russia to hack into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s email were "sarcastic" and that she believed he violated the Logan Act and should be "investigated for that. "  McCaskill said, "Well, it’s very clear to me that Donald Trump is unfit and, frankly, I think he’s dangerous. I believe there’s a chance he violated the law with what he said, inviting a   of Russia, a dictator what has violated all of our principles of liberty and freedom in Russia. The notion that he would invite a foreign nation to conduct an attack against our country it’s beyond the pale and I believe it violates the Logan Act and he should be investigated for that. I don’t think it was a joke at all. And it certainly wasn’t a joke when he said he’d pull the plug on NATO if he were president. And, by the way, that had Putin dancing in the halls. Putin is excited about Donald Trump being president of the United States. That notion make it very happy because he knows he could roll through Ukraine and other countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union because that’s his goal is to take back that territory and he knows Trump is not capable and is getting in his way.
