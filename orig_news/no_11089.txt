During her appearance on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Matt Boyle, Michelle Malkin said   Donald Trump’s choice of Rex Tillerson for secretary of state was "definitely a maverick choice" and "refreshing. " She supports the nomination of "a secretary of state who has the kind of business experience he does. "["Of course, there’s all sorts of wailing, gnashing of teeth, and moaning about his business dealings and his relationship with Russia," she observed. "But this is in tune with the President who won the election. He won, to borrow Obama’s phrase. I would just have to say that anyone who is not Romney is a massive improvement. Anyone who is not Hillary Clinton is a massive improvement. "   Michelle Malkin is a   author, senior editor of Conservative Review, and host of the new Michelle Malkin Investigates video series at CRTV. com.
