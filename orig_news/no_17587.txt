’  ’ ’     Senate Republicans are walking into a trap, and Donald Trump     might be the only person who can save them from themselves.   ’ ’     Republicans want to repeal Obamacare. That much we know, and     we’ve known it ever since Obamacare was first signed into law.     Had Mitt Romney been elected president in 2012, undoing the     Affordable Care Act would have been relatively straightforward,     as the Medicaid expansion and the health insurance exchanges     didn’t kick in until 2014. Repealing Obamacare now would have     huge   effects. It would mean taking insurance     coverage away from millions of people —  unless, that is,     Republicans can coalesce around a replacement that will cover     all those people or at least get in the same ballpark.   ’ ’     Republicans, though, are far less unified around what a     replacement ought to look like than they are in their     opposition to Obamacare. There are a couple of ways of going     forward.   ’ ’     Option No. 1: GOP legislators suck it up and do the hard work     of passing piecemeal health reform legislation, with the help     of centrist Senate Democrats. The  would be to give up on     starting from scratch, at least for now, and instead give     people who can’t or won’t buy   insurance     plans the option of buying cheaper,       insurance without premium subsidies. Subsidized       plans would still be available on the     exchanges, which would serve as a safety net for those too sick     or too poor to afford   plans with high        costs. Instead of pulling the rug out from under states that     expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, Congress could pick up a     higher share of the tab for the poorest and sickest Medicaid     beneficiaries while asking states to take on more     responsibility for helping the healthiest of them, a swap that     would greatly relieve the pressure on state budgets. In short,     rather than taking a wrecking ball to Obamacare, Republican     lawmakers could act as sculptors, chipping away at the     provisions they like least.   ’ ’       Option No. 2: Repeal Obamacare without a plan for replacing       it and hang a "Mission Accomplished" banner while America’s       health insurance market erupts in flame.     ’ ’  ’ ’       Naturally, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appears       hellbent on Option No. 2. This is "repeal and delay," a       strategy for unraveling Obamacare in the messiest, most       chaotic way possible.     ’ ’       Because Senate Republicans have a narrow   majority,       they can’t overcome a Democratic filibuster, so they can’t       really repeal Obamacare root and branch. The only way to get       to a   majority is to embrace Option No. 1.       What the Republicans can do without Democratic votes is use       the budget reconciliation process —  which requires a simple       majority vote —  to roll back Obamacare’s premium subsidies, its       payments to states that expanded their Medicaid rolls, and       its tax penalties targeting those who choose to go without       insurance coverage. Republicans in Congress passed a bill in       early 2016 that did just that, which President Obama promptly       vetoed. Once President Trump takes the reins, the thinking       goes, Republicans can get a big win under their belts,       establish their conservative bona fides, and then press ahead       with slashing taxes and regulations.     ’ ’       Repeal and delay wouldn’t cut off the flow of Obamacare funds       immediately. It would give Republicans in Congress until 2019       or 2020 to come up with a viable replacement. So what could       possibly go wrong? Pretty much everything.     ’ ’       The Obamacare exchanges are already in shambles, because       they’ve attracted an older, sicker set of enrollees than the       Obama administration had anticipated, which has driven up       costs. Obamacare was designed to nudge younger, healthier       people into enrolling on the exchanges by threatening them       with steep penalties if they failed to do so, but the       penalties have either been delayed or haven’t had much bite.       President Obama wanted to give insurers   subsidies       to compensate them for these    costs, but       Republican lawmakers intervened, insisting this would amount       to a .     ’ ’  ’ ’       The end result has been a highly unstable insurance market,       from which major insurers are constantly threatening to jump       ship. Instead of easing these pressures, repeal and delay       would further destabilize the market. Eliminating the tax       penalties would give the young and healthy even less reason       to buy insurance. Once the subsidies are placed in jeopardy,       even more insurers will lose interest in offering plans.         and   enrollees who currently receive premium       subsidies won’t be able to afford their insurance. Repeal and       delay, then, is a recipe for tens of thousands of individual       health care horror stories,   tales Republicans       would have to answer for.     ’ ’       There’s also the nightmare that would befall state       governments, including   state governments, that       embraced the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. By zeroing out the       federal payments that made the Medicaid expansion possible,       repeal and delay would bring on crippling budget crises. Just       imagine the   Republican governors would give       their   senators or the rowdy town halls where       Republicans members of Congress would find themselves burned       in effigy. It’s not a pretty picture. Honestly, the only way       repeal and delay makes sense is if you’re a         true believer who’d rather see the GOP destroy itself than       sell out.     ’ ’         But wait: Wouldn’t Republicans have years to craft a         functioning Obamacare replacement? Well, sure. But they’d         still have to unify the GOP and attract a handful of         Democrats. How exactly would they do that if repeal and         delay set off a massive national backlash? And what if         Democrats smelled blood in the water and sensed they had a         decent shot at taking back the House? Repeal and delay         assumes Republicans will have more leverage in two or three         years than they do today. That’s not obviously true.       ’ ’         The good news is that a handful of Senate Republicans get         that repeal and delay would be an epic disaster for the         GOP, so they’re pushing back against McConnell. Maine Sen.         Susan Collins has come out against it, which is not         shocking considering she represents a           state. More surprising is the opposition of Kentucky Sen.         Rand Paul, who has said he’s opposed to repeal and delay         because it adds . Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who has a         reputation as an obsessive health care wonk, has also         expressed skepticism about repealing Obamacare without         having a replacement ready to go. And as of Thursday night,         Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, a leading light among younger         conservatives, has .       ’ ’         You’d think that objections from at least four senators,         who almost certainly speak for several others, would be         enough to get McConnell to shelve his            plans. But most senators, like most humans, are wimps. If         McConnell forces GOP senators to choose sides on a            bill, he knows armies of conservative         activists will pillory any "nay" voters for having kept         Obamacare alive. That prospect might not frighten Susan         Collins, who has every incentive to present herself as a           centrist. But it might be enough to bring the         other dissenters in line.       ’ ’           Unless, that is, Trump gets in the way. Trump’s tweeting           earlier this week managed to spook House Republicans out           of . Now, he’s  to           suggest he wants Republicans and Democrats to work           together to replace Obamacare with a better and cheaper           approach to providing Americans with insurance coverage.           Could this be a signal that Trump doesn’t want Congress           consumed with a   Obamacare meltdown? Might he           be more favorably disposed to Option No. 1 (play nice)           than Option No. 2 (let slip the dogs of war)? More to the           point, could Trump give cover to Senate Republicans who           don’t want to go along with McConnell’s kamikaze           strategy? There’s no way of knowing. Trump could tweet           the exact opposite sentiment five minutes after I publish           this story.         ’ ’           But how weird would it be if Trump —  a man who seems           blithely indifferent to the   details of           policy, and who’s had no compunction about belittling his           fellow Republicans when it has suited his           purposes —  managed to prevent Republicans in Congress from           making a colossal policy blunder?         ’
