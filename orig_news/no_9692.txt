Welcome to Breitbart News’s live updates of the 2016 election. Hillary Clinton is expected to announce her vice presidential pick today and appear with her selection tomorrow in Florida. The media elite and Democrats seem to have all (what a coincidence!) thought Donald Trump’s speech was "dark. " They were all on the same page with coordinated talking points across all networks. It’s easy for elites living in "Boomtowns" to not see many of the problems Americans are facing, and that disconnect, especially on illegal immigration, is what propelled Trump to the nomination and may win him the White House.  The mainstream media seem to be perking up (just listen to their tone) as they get to become "homers" next week for the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. But when Black Lives Matter speakers and others talk about all that they think is wrong with America next week, will the same media elites who denounced Trump’s speech also slam Democrats for painting a "dark" picture of America?

Clinton may also be going   on Virginia, thinking that if she wins Virginia, the election is over. Kaine, an ultimate political insider who will face charges of cronyism and corruption after having received lavish gifts while he was Lieutenant Governor and Governor, reinforces many of Clinton’s negatives.
