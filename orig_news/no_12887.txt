Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s "The Kelly File," liberal filmmaker Michael Moore reacted to the likelihood of Donald Trump being the Republican presidential nominee.  Moore told host Megyn Kelly he thought Trump would be the nominee going back to last fall and noted that he has the ability to appeal to certain segments of the electorate. "I’ve taken him serious," Moore said. "I felt last fall that he would be the Republican nominee. I think that a lot of people just treat it as a joke and yeah, it’s funny and I laugh at all the joke. But he says things. He goes to places where I’m from, like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, etc. and tells them Apple should be building those iPhones in the U. S. not in China. That sounds very good. " Moore questioned whether or not Trump believed his statement to be true, calling him a "capitalist" that knows performance art. However, Moore warned that those who once thought of Trump as a "joke" should no longer do so. "I think that  —   I think everybody now is taking Donald Trump very seriously," Moore said. "And everybody who thought he was a joke last summer, ‘No way is this going to happen,’ right  —   nobody should treat it like it’s a joke now. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
