On Monday’s broadcast of CNN’s "The Lead," filmmaker Michael Moore argued, "I don’t trust these polls, especially in the upper Midwest, in the Rust Belt. I think people tell the pollsters one thing and they’re thinking another. "  After saying Trump was a "narcissist" and perpetrating a con, Moore stated, "[W]atching the pundits this morning on cable news, everybody’s like, why is he in Michigan? And I remember, on our primary day back in March, there were over 100, 000 more Republicans that showed up to vote on their side of the ballot than on the Democratic side. And the race over there was pretty much over. It was a big race between Hillary and Bernie. That morning, the majority of the polls showed Hillary ahead of Bernie anywhere from 8 to 20 points in Michigan. 12 hours later she lost to Bernie Sanders. I don’t trust these polls, especially in the upper Midwest, in the Rust Belt. I think people tell the pollsters one thing and they’re thinking another. People have to be busy.   …     You should be out there doing what you can do to get Hillary Clinton elected, because every minute counts now, and they are confident that they’re going to pick up enough votes from people who used to have real jobs, and no longer do, and they’re going to be out and voting because they’re angry.
