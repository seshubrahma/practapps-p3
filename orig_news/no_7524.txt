The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) the organization that represents nearly 17, 000 of the Border Patrol agents who risk their lives to secure U. S. borders, is challenging the Colorado GOP for not holding a state primary and instead slating delegates mostly favorable to Trump’s rival Sen. Ted Cruz ( ). [The NBPC recently endorsed Trump for president after the candidate shocked them by publicly declaring that actual Border Patrol agents would have a seat at the head of the table in any discussions on U. S. border security policy.  In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News, the National Border Patrol Council wrote: In our March 30th endorsement statement of Donald J. Trump, we, the National Border Patrol Council called upon the American people to stand with border agents in support of Mr. Trump and his pledge to end illegal immigration. We fully expected that the will of the American electorate, whatever they decided in this primary, would be upheld. It is now clear that voters are being disenfranchised in order to protect established interests. By cancelling the election in Colorado, the Republican Party has found a brand new way to disenfranchise voters who want secure borders and safe communities.  Once again, the will of the public  —   who have pleaded for immigration enforcement  —   is being overridden by special interests with agendas. We see the same thing happening across the country, where delegates won by Mr. Trump  —   through a popular recorded vote  —   have made secret arrangements to support other candidates, thwarting the will of the millions of voters they collectively are supposed to represent. This is insidious. I am calling today on the Republican Party to promise free, fair and open elections in America. All candidates should join in this demand. Elections should mean that the people  —   not party insiders  —   choose the nominee. We will never secure our immigration system unless the raw will of the American people is imposed through the ballot box. Clearly, politicians and special interests will continue to betray America’s interests if they are left to their own devices. Over the past weekend, the Colorado Republican Party held its state convention, where at least 30 of the 37 Colorado delegates selected to attend the Republican National Convention and cast a vote for the 2016 nominee favor Cruz. Following Cruz’s sweep, the Colorado GOP sent out a tweet from its official Twitter account, reading, "We did it! #NeverTrump. " The tweet was subsequently deleted, but the occurrence is fueling backlash from voters who believe the establishment is obstructing the will of the people. Trump also weighed in on Twitter about the people of Colorado not having their vote count: How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger  —   totally unfair!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2016,  The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2016, ****** (Disclosure: Breitbart Texas sponsored the Green Line podcast for the NBPC in an effort to provide a platform for agents to inform the public about the realities on the border and what Border Patrol agents face. Director Brandon Darby received an award from the Laredo chapter of the NBPC for his work in helping to defend and bring a voice to Border Patrol agents. Breitbart News assisted in covering funeral costs for a slain Border Patrol agent previously. Darby and Breitbart senior management have directly stated and shown that helping to bring a voice to the expressed needs and interests of Border Patrol agents is a top priority —  personally, individually and together through Breitbart News.) ****** Listen to the audio below of Brandon Darby discussing this article on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM:
