Welcome to Breitbart News’s daily live updates of the 2016 horse race. [ —    12:25: On CNN, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver says Sanders won Michigan because of trade policies that Hillary Clinton supported. Sanders’s message crossed racial lines, Weaver says, and that is why he performed better with northern black voters than Southern blacks. Weaver says the calendar will now favor Sanders going forward and it will allow Sanders to pick up the delegates necessary to win the nomination. 12:24: Shocking upset for Sanders: You can see all the polls that showed Sanders was ahead in Michigan (none!) pic. twitter.   —   Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) March 9, 2016,  12:15: Trump wins in Romney Country: Oakland County 100% reporting: Trump 36. 2% to Kasich 31. 86% Clinton 51. 35% to Sanders 46. 83%  —   Crain’s Detroit Biz (@crainsdetroit) March 9, 2016,  Trump wins Oakland Co, MICH by over 4pct!

They will try to convince Messrs. Rubio, Kasich to stay in the race in order to stop Trump at a contested convention. 11:34: Clinton campaign spinning: Clinton’s communication director says that Michigan was demographically advantageous for Sanders.

Maybe because she is seen as inauthentic, has been on the wrong side of bad trade deals, and trying to make "technical" arguments that Sanders voted against the bailouts reinforces everything that voters hate about the "calculating" Clinton. 10:52: Sanders: "A fantastic night in Michigan. " He is grateful for all of the support. 10:49: Sanders holds a Miami press conference to thank the people of Michigan for "repudiating the polls" that had the campaign 25 points down and repudiated the pundits who said that "Bernie Sanders isn’t going anywhere. " He thanks his volunteers. Sanders says tonight showed that his campaign is strong in every part of the country and his strongest states have yet to vote. He says Americans are tired of the rigged economy and a broken criminal justice system. Trump could wrap up GOP race next week. Democrats might go until June. Isn’t politics amazing?  —   Taegan Goddard (@politicalwire) March 9, 2016,  10:43: According to CNN, Sanders got 49% of black voters under 45 in Michigan. And that’s why he may pull off the upset. 10:36: Sanders may pull off arguably one of the greatest political  upsets if he wins Michigan: If Sanders wins MI tonight, it will break Gary Hart’s record in 1984 NH for greatest upset vs. final polling aveage. https:  .   —   Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) March 9, 2016,  10:32: Steve Forbes: Pressure on Rubio to leave race will intensify: Pressure on Rubio to pull out will grow exponentially.

On CNN, Donna Brazile says if Sanders pull out a Michigan win, the race could go to June. 10:28: Chuck Todd on the Never Trump "Smart Set. " For   GOPers, they must feel like Charlie Brown  the football.  Every time they think they have momentum to stop him, voters vote,  —   Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) March 9, 2016,  10:25: Nolte to ‘Never Trump’ folks: Fun’s over #NeverTrump.  Time to grow up.  —   John Nolte (@NolteNC) March 9, 2016,  [Tony Lee: At some point, Trump’s constantly talking about process and having to scratch the itch and refute every negative thing said about him while promoting his holdings gets old. He should leave that up to his surrogates. It will start to wear thin in a general election. Trump still needs to be Trump. Lines like thanking the "lobbyists and special interests" for helping his numbers rise are great. But talking incessantly about polls and process may lead voters to ask, "where’s the beef?" It also makes it seem like he’s just winging it. Once again, Trump missed a huge opportunity to appeal to more Americans and broaden his base of support. Majorities in Mississippi and Michigan, according to exit polls, believed that bad trade deals are destroying American jobs. Trump’s tough talk on trade goes to the core of his appeal. It is also the issue that  may allow him to win a general election against Clinton by attracting   whites and minorities who don’t want to see their jobs shipped overseas. Trump could have used his first minutes of his press conference to talk about trade, American workers and how the GOP can grow the party by championing the issues he has been talking about on the stump. He could have addressed American workers in all communities —    class workers who thought they would have at least the same   lifestyle their parents had, black communities that have been decimated because factories and plants in their communities have closed due to bad trade deals, Americans of Hispanic and Asian descent who are having trouble finding jobs because of illegal immigration, and   Americans of all backgrounds who are worried that cheaper,   foreigners will be brought in to replace them while they are forced to train them. Instead, he spent most of his press conference attacking irrelevant Lindsey Graham, pointing out that Charles Krauthammer finally acknowledged that he did well (why the hell should he care what he thinks?) settling scores with Mitt Romney, blasting bad polls from the Wall Street Journal and incessantly giving       accounts of     minutiae that no regular voter gives a damn about except for someone like Trump who seems obsessed about reading every story written about him (to be fair, Trump’s insatiable appetite for all news about him does make him a better candidate than those whose advisers keep in a bubble because he knows what the political conversation is on any given day. He should keep reading all that is written about him but he seems small when he feels the need to constantly comment on every poll, every criticism, every bad story, etc. ). Trump was all over the map. It’s time for him and his team to start gearing   for the general election. Get   down and stick to them while leaving room for Trump to be Trump on the news of the day to stay in the news and not lose his authenticity. He can wing his way to the GOP nomination. But that act won’t fly in the general election against the   media machine.] 9:50: Meanwhile, none of the networks covered Clinton’s speech. All eyes on Trump —  because you have no idea what he will say unlike traditional politicians whose speeches everyone has memorized by now: Clinton wraps up. not one network popped in for a moment.  —   Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) March 9, 2016,  Apparently, she was targeting ‘Scandal’ viewers: Clinton pushing HARD for the Scandal vote with a Defiance, Ohio reference.  —   Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) March 9, 2016,  9:41: Trump says that he hears that $39 million has been spent attacking him. He says as he was watching his golf tournament, every negative ad in Florida was about him. Trump says it’s time to unify because we have "something special going on in the Republican Party" where millions of people are voting. He says the Republican elites do not understand what is going on and should "embrace it. " He says Democrats should love what’s happening. There’s no spirit on the left, he says. Trump blasts "eggheads" in the National Review for not understanding how serious America’s trade deficit with China is. He says he can probably get along with Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney. He says we can unify the party and "nobody’s going to beat us. " 9:36: Trump says he has nothing to say to Rubio and Rubio will have to decide what the best path for him is going forward. He says hostility works for some people and doesn’t for others. He says he had a good relationship with Marco until the "GOP smart set" convinced him to act like a petulant juvenile and launch inane attacks against Trump on the stump. 9:34: Trump says he has won many club championships and he knows how to close. "Winning is winning. " Trump says Clinton is a "flawed candidate" and it will be an easy race if Clinton is allowed to run. He says if the government does it job properly, she will not be able to run. 9:30: Trump says politicians will "never get you to the promised land. " 9:25: Trump says what this election is showing is that advertising is less important than competence. Trump says even Megyn Kelly said "Donald Trump did well tonight. " Trump: "Thank you, Megyn. " He says even Charles Krauthammer said so as well. Now Trump is using precious time on all television networks to attack irrelevant Lindsey Graham. He is proud that every single candidate who has attacked him viciously is gone. Now, Trump pivots to ISIS. He says ISIS should not be dictating terms. Trump says Evangelicals don’t like the way Ted talks and Trump talks about how Christianity is being chipped away. Trump says he can win states like New York that Republicans have not been competitive in past elections. He says he will win Michigan. He says for other Republicans, "it’s never even a question. " He says he will Ohio and Virginia because he has "great properties in Virginia. " He says having properties in a  state means you love the state and have a lot of employees in the state. 9:12: Trump, again talking about process, says after $38 million worth of lies, he still won. He says it shows how smart the public is. "I want to thank the public," Trump says before thanking the people of Mississippi and Michigan. Now he touts his friendship with Jack Nicklaus (good play for Ohio —  who knows it was intentional or not). He also recognizes former Yankee Paul O’Neil in the audience. Trump says it is very important that our Senators and Congressmen are   even though not all of them are on his side. Trump says he is happy about turnout. Trump says the biggest story in politics is the huge turnout in GOP primaries with Democrats and Republicans coming over. He says a lot of voter are   voters. He wants to thank the "special interests" and the "lobbyists" because they "obviously did something to drive the numbers. " Trump wants to thank Paul Ryan. Trump says he could not have been nicer. "Great respect," he says. He now slams Cruz for saying he is the only one who can beat Donald Trump but "he never beats me. " Trump says Cruz will have a tough time in the states ahead. He praises Christie for being a "great prosecutor. I watched what he did to Marco. " Now Trump defends his financials (no debt) and his properties (Trump International, Doral, etc.) Trump is using his press conference to showcase Trump magazine, Trump steaks, Trump water, etc. and ridicules Romney (who claimed Trump steaks and Trump magazine were not around anymore) for attacking his companies. He says he sold his airline. And he defends Trump University. Trump says the press members can take a bottle of wine home if they want. [Here is what Romney read off of his teleprompter last week: "And whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there’s Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not. "] 9:10: Fox News, NBC call Michigan for Trump.  [Tony Lee: Trump recognized how much GOP primary voters despised the political establishment —  and how much immigration and trade mattered —  this election cycle like Obama realized how much   liberals hated George W. Bush   and the Iraq War in 2008. Though the analogy is not perfect, Kasich, in some ways, reminds me of John Edwards in 2004.] 9:05: Step and   bar at Trump’s press conference: There’s also a Trump Step and Repeat pic. twitter.   —   Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) March 9, 2016,  Also an open bar. pic. twitter.   —   Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) March 9, 2016,  9:02: Bad  night for Rubio: This is how poorly Rubio is doing  …    .

He addresses supporters in Miami and says his supporters must have the courage to take on   interests "whose greed is destroying our economy. " Sanders says other candidates are not telling Americans "several truths. " Sanders says our "Democratic form of government is under severe attack" because of Citizens United. He blasts the Koch brothers and a few other "billionaires" to elect candidates who will represent the "rich and the powerful. " He says "our fight" is to overturn Citizens United and have high voter turnout, end Republican voter suppression. Sanders says let’s show the world on Tuesday that democracy is alive and well with a "YUGE voter turnout.

Also,    with Hillary only have Trump on top (but it’s all within MOE). If Trump and Clinton were the candidates in November, Trump would win with 45 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 44 percent. If it’s between Cruz and Clinton, Clinton would receive 46 percent of the votes while Cruz would receive 44 percent. Clinton would also lead against Rubio with 45 percent of the votes against the Florida senator’s 44 percent of the votes. 11:23  —   Trump up 10 points in    Illinois. Overall, Trump had the support of 32 percent, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with 22 percent, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with 21 percent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich with 18 percent. An additional 7 percent were undecided. The poll of 600 registered voters likely to cast a ballot in the Republican primary has an error margin of 4. 1 percentage points.

I helped launch the #NeverTrump movement with my piece written late two Friday’s ago. That night it got over 60, 000 hits and the #NeverTrump hashtag became a worldwide trend. Credit for the hashtag goes to my friend Aaron Gardner. I’d used #AgainstTrump, the title of the National Reviewcover, but Aaron suggested I change it. What I am seeing at this point, however, is that #NeverTrump is guaranteeing Trump’s nomination because #NeverTrump is really #NeverTed. Many of the most vocal supporters of the #NeverTrump movement are Marco Rubio supporters and they are handing the nomination to Trump because they cannot face the reality of this election.   …     The only way to stop Trump now is to ally with Ted Cruz. But too many of the #NeverTrump brigade are really #NeverTed. They don’t want to look at the math, they don’t want to look at the road ahead, they don’t want Ted Cruz. They’d rather lose with Rubio and stay home in November than ally with Ted Cruz and even have a shot in November. That is genuinely unfortunate and will either guarantee Trump is the nominee or guarantee the Republican Party is destroyed. Marco Rubio, a great man with a struggling campaign, has a cult of personality every bit as committed as Trump’s. The difference is that Rubio’s cult will give us Trump where Trump’s cult alone never could. 10:29  —   Bret Baier: Republicans in DC are saying privately that they’ll vote for Hillary just to keep their power over the party.

"Today you have the opportunity in Michigan to vote for a Republican nominee for president," Romney continues. "These are critical times that demand a serious, thoughtful   . If we Republicans were to choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future would be greatly diminished  —   and I’m convinced Donald Trump would lose to Hillary Clinton.

"I think that whoever is leading at the end should sort of get it. That’s the way that democracy works," Trump said on the program.   8:51  —   Wapo poll: Trump loses to Cruz and Rubio in    race. In hypothetical   matchups, Cruz leads Trump by   percent and Rubio leads Trump by   percent in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates. While the latter lead isn’t statistically significant, both are further signs of the apparent limits to Trump’s popularity within his party.
