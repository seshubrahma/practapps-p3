WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   Vice President Mike Pence honored veterans this Memorial Day from his residence at the Naval Observatory, where about 200 vets attended and Project Hero launched its 10th Annual Memorial Day bike ride to Virginia Beach. [Pence stepped out and greeted the close to 100 riders to cheers from the crowd. He was joined by Karen Pence and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin.  Project Hero President John Wordin addressed the crowd, noting it was the fourth year in a row the ride began at the Vice President’s residence. He pointed out the problem of suicide among veterans and Shulkin’s work in partnership with Project Hero to address it. Shulkin told the crowd, "If it’s for veterans, they’re going to be there for us. " He continued, "Both he and Karen are passionate and relentless when it comes to veterans’ issues. " Pence then took to the podium saying, "This is a day we remember those who served and did not come home  …    To be able to welcome you here on this most hallowed of days is profoundly humbling to Karen and I. " The Vice President thanked the veterans in attendance for their service and thanked Project Hero. "We’ll be joining the president in just a few moments at Arlington National Cemetery," said Pence, adding that he and Karen, as avid cyclists themselves, were slightly jealous of the riders who would be setting out for Virginia Beach shortly. Karen and I are so grateful to have you here at the Vice President’s residence.
