GOP frontrunner Donald Trump says Apple is "100 percent wrong" for not providing the FBI access to the San Bernardino terrorist’s iPhone. ["We have to find out what’s on those phones," the real estate mogul said during an interview on Breitbart News Daily with host Stephen K. Bannon. "They should break into the phone. "  He added that Apple was "100 percent wrong" for not complying with the FBI’s request for the information to aid the investigation.

S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. " Breitbart News Daily airs weekdays from 6 AM to 9 AM on SiriusXM Patriot Ch. 125.
