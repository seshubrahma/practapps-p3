The President will participate in meetings with his Spanish counterpart and other government officials on Sunday then travel to Rota as previously scheduled to speak to military personnel serving there. The President will return to Washington on Sunday night  —   one day earlier than planned. The President will no longer travel to Seville.    The President has accepted an invitation from Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings to travel to Dallas early next week. Later in the week, at the White House, the President will continue the work to bring people together to support our police officers and communities, and find common ground by discussing policy ideas for addressing the persistent racial disparities in our criminal justice system. We’ll have more details about next week’s activities as soon as they are available. Update 6:20: Greg Abbott’s open letter calling for unity: A Time to Come Together, By Governor Greg Abbott  Our hearts are heavy. Last night in Dallas, five law enforcement officers were killed seven officers and two civilians were wounded. The coordinated ambush and deliberate, brutal executions were acts of cowardice  —   hiding behind innocents to target and savagely slaughter peace officers dedicated to preserving life and our freedoms. The full force of the law must ensure all responsible are brought to justice and our communities are kept secure. Justice will be served, but justice is small solace for the families left behind. We mourn for the families of the fallen, for the law enforcement community and for our nation. Respect for our law enforcement officers must be restored in our nation. The badge every officer wears over his or her heart is a reminder of a sacred trust, a commitment, a contract with each of us. For law enforcement officers to stand in front of us and all that threatens, we must stand behind them. Every life matters. With each innocent life lost, we lose more of our humanity. It is time for us to unite as Texans, as Americans, to say no more. No more will we tolerate disrespect for those who serve. No more will we allow the evil of hate merchants to tear us apart. Though anguish and sorrow may darken the days ahead, we will not be overcome by evil  —   we will overcome evil with good. Texas is an exceptional state with exceptional people. We’ve faced tough challenges in the past, but we have come together to overcome those challenges. In the coming days, there will be those who foment distrust and fan the flames of dissension. To come together  —   that would be the greatest rebuke to those who seek to tear us apart. There is far more that binds us together. We see that great strength in times of tragedy, in times of great need. Whether fire or flood or the acts of depraved individuals, Texans are the first to open their hearts, their homes, their wallets to offer charity and love. I ask for your prayers  —   for our law enforcement officers, for the city of Dallas, for our state and for our nation. May God comfort those who’ve lost a family member. And may God heal the hurt in our communities. I have faith in the goodness of Texas, of America. For in the end, evil always fails. Update 6:16: Abbott says he has no information on any   but he just wants to make sure "we button down every corner before we rule out any possible  . " Update 6:13: Abbott says if there are   they will also receive the "justice they deserve. " He says in the coming days, the primary message should be "unity. " Abbott says Texas have always been resilient and that trademark resilience is needed now more than ever. Update 6:05: Abbott expresses his gratitude to Police Chief Brown for his "unrelenting resolve. " He says Texas stands united with the city of Dallas and describes the past 24 hours as a "tale of two cities. " "One the one hand, it’s been a tale of heroism of police officers. At the same time, it’s been a tale of cowardice by an assassin," Abbott says, adding that he is so proud of the Dallas Police Department and Dallas Area Rapid Transit. Abbott says they have the respect of a great state and a governor who "has your back.

When an officer stopped us, Mazara and I immediately became nervous, "I know who you guys are" he said. "Joey Gallo and Nomar Mazara, can I get a picture with you guys please?" It was definitely a first for me and Nomar to have an officer, a true hero, want to meet us. His name is Patrick Zamarripa, one of the officers killed in last nights shootings in Dallas. I’ll never forget how kind and down to Earth he was. We ended up having a 15 minute conversation about sports with him. He was an avid Rangers fan. But more importantly a great person, and family man. Please keep Patrick, and all the officers affected and their families in our prayers today. #prayfordallas, A photo posted by Joey Gallo (@joeygallo24) on Jul 8, 2016 at 2:09pm PDT,  Update 5:40: Texas Gov.

America lost heroes last night as men in uniform did their unfathomably courageous job running into danger to protect others from it. Honorable first responders deserve our outmost respect and support. Shame on our culture’s influencers who would stir contention and division that could lead to evil such as that in Dallas. Shame on politicians and pundits giving credence to thugs rioting against police officers and the rule of law in the name of "peaceful protests. " It is a farce. #BlackLivesMatter is a farce. Media: quit claiming the rioters are "peaceful" as they stomp on our flag, shout "death to cops!" and celebrate violence. It is sick. You perpetuate a perverted message evil men thrive on to intimidate and warp malleable minds that would believe one race matters more than another. Blood is on your complicit hands when you naively or purposefully refuse to tell of this movement’s truth. Black Lives Matter? Yes  —   more than BLM "protestors" can grasp, as evidenced by their   provocateurism. Doesn’t it go without saying that Native lives matter, too? And Asian and Eskimo and Hispanic and Indian  …     and every other race comprised of people who see clearly the agenda at play to weaken America through disunity. Get fed up and stand up if you’re sick of being called racist when proclaiming EVERY LIFE MATTERS, black as much as white and every skin tone in between. Every innocent life  —   at every stage of life  —   on the side of good over evil, matters. Why let the damaging false narrative prevail if you know it is a lie?! Speak up! Join me in refusing to go willingly with society trying to crown deceptive political correctness the victor.   that put any race in front of being an American are now used to further divide our nation. It’s time to acknowledge you’re either an American under our system of equality, law and order  —   and traditional patriotic spirit  —   or you’re not. Knock off the hyphenation of who we are. And knock off the shoulder chip if you’ve let "leaders" burden you with it through their example that sadly capitalizes on division for untoward purposes. That chip is crushing the people’s hope. My youngest daughter recently confirmed the sensibility in this when she stated, "It would be sad to call myself an " " instead of just a proud American like everyone else. " Seeing partial footage of this week’s victims’ tragic deaths at the hands of police officers is  . It’s nauseating. Granted, early reports rarely encapsulate all the facts of individual cases, but my heart is with victims’ families as I sympathize with anyone defenseless in these situations. More so, I empathize if we find out any cop involved was in the wrong, for I abhor bad cops. I abhor police union leadership that regularly protects bad cops and discredits citizens voicing concern over bad actors in authority. I’ve been there. Many of you know my own experience with   constant, frightening encounters and threats to my family to "bring us down" via a badge and gun. We suffered an exhausting era knowing we were defenseless against a bad cop, his union, and a gleefully politicized media never reporting the truth. Threats that included the promise we’d be pulled over for whatever reason, destroyed, and "any judge will believe the badge over the citizen. " The   situation nearly devastated us. Political opponents still get off on all the situation cost us. So believe me, my personal experience won’t let me throw a blanket of blind approval over all law enforcement and those in authority. Still, last night’s disgusting acts that snuffed out officers’ lives is exponentially worse than any one bad cop, his union bosses, and the media’s verbose attempts to intimidate and falsely accuse. So if we’re to take sides, I side with the Thin Blue Line. To side with our public servants trying to keep law and order amidst political agendas that clearly oppose that virtue is how the good guys win again. It’s the only way to ensure our best days will be ahead of us. Join me. Do not let today’s agenda redefine what it means to be an American. Do not sit still for it to fundamentally transform America. God created us equally, and not with a spirit of fear. We’re given the spirit of POWER, love and a sound mind.

When he was walking back to his car, the suspect exited his vehicle and shot the officer from behind. The entire incident was captured on the officer’s dash cam.   More from the Associated Press: The St. Louis County police chief says the suspect the shooting of a police officer was on probation for a weapons violation in St. Louis. Chief Jon Belmar said Friday at a news conference that the suspect, who police say shot the officer as he was walking back to his car during a traffic stop, also had been on probation for a stolen vehicle in Oklahoma and was picked up for a firearm violation in California. He was paroled in 2015. Belmar said that the man likely will be charged in the shooting, which occurred shortly after 11 a. m. Friday in the west St. Louis suburb of Ballwin. Police said three shots were fired and the officer was at least hit once. He is in critical but stable condition in a local hospital. Authorities did not provide the race or identity of the officer or the suspect. Update 4:35: The mainstream media want to paint "false flag" conspiracy theorists as   folks who think the government wants to take away guns and get Hillary Clinton’s email scandal out of the news cycle, but the Daily Beast reports that a prominent Black Lives Matter activist suggested the horrific Dallas police massacre was a false flag operation meant to turn public opinion against the Black Lives Matter protesters: A prominent figure in the Black Lives Matter community took to Twitter on Friday morning to voice doubts about the previous night’s mass shooting at a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas, Texas. On Friday afternoon, activist Johnetta Elzie suggested the massacre was intended to turn opinion against peaceful protesters. "I will not let go of the fact that I know cointelpro exists," Elzie tweeted, echoing other users who have expressed suspicion over details of the shooting. "From my experience, whenever public opinion shifts to strongly support the movement an act of violence against the police happens," she also suggested.
