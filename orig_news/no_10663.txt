Chuck Todd, the moderator of NBC’s "Meet the Press," told Politico’s "Off Message" podcast earlier this month that   Donald Trump was a "salesman" and has an ultimate goal to be "popular. "  Todd said of Trump, "He is a marketer. He is a salesman. I’ve never met a salesman that didn’t exaggerate or worse. And one of the things we have to remember about him because it’s the salesman mentality. He will never say a negative word about you in person. To your face. he will always compliment —  always find a way to compliment. It’s every salesman trick in the book, like Dale Carnegie. " Todd continued, "He doesn’t want to be unpopular. That is a powerful thing  …    I think he is an any means necessary kind of guy. I think he is a transactional guy," adding, "I ultimately believe that guardrails for him are popularity, and that matters to him. " (  Politico) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
