Actor and singer Eric McCormack says he would be willing to perform at   Donald Trump’s inauguration on one condition. ["A lobotomy," McCormack said in an interview with The Wrap. "My whole brain removed from my head. "  The   star rose to prominence in the late   2000s for his role in NBC’s   comedy sitcom Will and Grace. McCormack, who had been a fierce opponent of Trump throughout the campaign, said his policies as president will impact Canadians. "The States doesn’t think much about Canada, but we’re attached," McCormack told the outlet. "We’re like Siamese twins. We can’t do things  —   you can’t roll over in the American bed without waking up the Canadians. It matters. " "That night and since, I’ve had friends calling me going, ‘What is going on here? ’" he added. "Everyday there’s something that makes you go, ‘Is this Funny or Die? That can’t be a real headline.’ What’s happening?" McCormack and his Will and Grace   Debra Messing, Megan Mullally, and Sean Hayes reunited in September to star in a "new scene" from the celebrated show. The   scene, which aired online, was full of swipes directed toward Trump. The    actor says he is not sure who would want to perform at Trump’s inauguration. "A country singer and two squirrels. I don’t know what the   will be, but I hear Scott Baio’s doing dramatic readings," he said of the famous Trump supporter Baio. To date,    opera singer Jackie Evancho is set to perform the national anthem at Trump’s inauguration. "I have recently been asked by the   to perform the National Anthem for the   ceremony at the inauguration," Evancho said on Today Wednesday morning. "I’m so excited. It’s going to be awesome. " The inauguration will be held in Washington, D. C. on January 20. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.
