"A visibly pained Marco Rubio  that he doesn’t know whether he’d be able to support Donald Trump if the Republican frontrunner wins their party’s presidential nomination." ’A day after  at Trump’’s Chicago rally, Rubio said he’’s concerned that the   magnate is feeding civil unrest, leading the country to "chaos" and "anarchy. "’ ’"You wonder if we’’re headed in a different direction today where we’’re no longer capable of having differences of opinion but in fact now protests become a license to take up violence and take on your opponents physically," Rubio said Saturday. "This is what happens when a leading presidential candidate goes around feeding into a narrative of bitterness and anger and frustration.

Given the look on his face Saturday morning, I believe he may not be able to bring himself to do it. But to withhold his support from Trump, he would have to admit that the prospect of another Democratic administration is not as horrible as he has said all along.’ ’"I think we all need to take a step back and ask whether we’’re contributing to this," Rubio said Saturday about the unrest. He should start with himself.’ ’’ ’A visibly pained Marco Rubio told reporters. ..’
