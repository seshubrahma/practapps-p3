’  ’ ’   It already seems as if President Donald Trump and the Republican   Party are getting ready to make a major reversal on the kind of   budget they promised to deliver to Congress. ’ ’   Instead of delivering something " " that wouldn’’t   add to the deficit  —   the kind of fiscally responsible budget the   GOP has been railing about for years  —   we’’re in line to get a   deficit exploder. ’ ’   How do we know? Because   Republicans are already   throwing out the idea that we need to have a balanced budget. ’ ’   "So, tax reform and lowering taxes, you know, will create and   generate more income," Rep. Mark Meadows, . "And so   we’’re looking at those, where the fine balance is. But does it   have to be fully offset? My personal response is ’’no. ’’" ’ ’   You heard that right. The fiscally responsible   just   gave the   for a spending spree. ’ "   Now, from the sound of it, this will happen for the same reason   the Republican attempt to overhaul the US healthcare system   failed  —   because it’s hard to pass legislation. At least, that’s   what the Office of Management and Budget director, Mick Mulvaney,   said on NBC’s . " ’   "What happened was that Washington won," he said. "Washington is   a lot more broken than Trump thought it was." ’ ’   He continued: "We haven’’t been able to change Washington in the   first 65 days. And I think if there’’s anything that’’s   disappointing and sort of an educational process to the Trump   administration, was that this place was a lot more rotten than we   thought that it was. "’ ’ ’ "   And of course, we know that without the $1 trillion in   entitlement cuts that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the   healthcare law better known as Obamacare, would’ve provided, the   whole   thing was going to be harder to achieve   anyway. Perhaps that’s what Meadows was acknowledging, but  —     either way  —   it’s too late to get that budget cut back. " "   So here we are, exactly where we’ve been before. " " President Ronald Reagan’s budget director,   complained that he was never able to cut as much from the budget   as he needed to make it balanced because of Washington’s horse   trading. That was during a period when Republicans and Democrats   actually talked to each other. Reagan’s administration ended up   exploding the deficit as well as the size of the federal   government. " ’   Ultimately Stockman came to believe that there were "no real   conservatives" when it came to fiscal responsibility in   Washington, and if Meadows was being honest on Sunday, Stockman’’s   words still ring true. ’ ’   That leaves us with a bunch of Republicans who really like tax   cuts and are just   on fiscal conservatism. ’ ’  ’ "   The fact that Republicans didn’t kill Obamacare means that more   controversial elements of Trump’s tax proposals,  are a must if the budget will   remain  . And tax reform has to be     for it to pass through a   process called   reconciliation. " ’   That will be hard. It would involve horse trading  —   maybe even   with Democrats. Mulvaney may have to grab his smelling salts. ’ ’   And so will the rest of us. The hope in Washington was that tax   reform would pass by August, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch   McConnell is . ’ "   So are some folks on Wall Street. Here’s what Societe Generale’s   analysts wrote about it on Sunday: " ’   Without border adjustment, Societe Generale believes: "Either   other tax cuts will not be so deep, or other revenue measures   need to be raised. The full expensing of capital investments may   not be truly full, or the cut in the corporate marginal tax rate   from 35% may not go as low as 20%." ’ "   In other words, we’re going to get a   tax bill that   looks nothing special  —   at least, if you don’t want to blow a   hole in the budget. " ’   Or there’’s another option that the Freedom Caucus has just put on   the table  —   scrap the whole "fiscal responsibility" thing and   just try to lower taxes (budget be damned) as much as possible,   even if it doesn’’t happen this year. ’ ’   YOLO.* ’ ’   *YOLO means "you only live once" and is being used here   ironically. ’ ’It already seems as if President Donald Trump. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
