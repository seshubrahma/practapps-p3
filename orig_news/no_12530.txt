Mitt Romney says a   race helps Donald Trump win the Republican presidential nomination, and only Ted Cruz has a shot to block his path to 1, 237 delegates. [From CNN:  Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney is again warning his party of the dangers of a Donald Trump nomination, saying a   race likely paves the way for the New York billionaire to capture the nomination on the first ballot of this summer’s GOP convention in Cleveland. The former Massachusetts governor, in an interview on "The David Gregory Show" podcast saysTuesday’s New York primary is an important moment in the primary fight. "If (Gov. John Kasich and Sen.
