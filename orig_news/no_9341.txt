At a campaign event on Friday in Nashua, NH, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said his opponent Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) "got pummeled" at last night’s Fox News GOP presidential debate.  Trump did not attend the presidential debate, which has been attributed to his ongoing feud with FNC’s "The Kelly File" host Megyn Kelly, one of the moderators of the debate. Trump said, "We have a big day coming up. We have a number one, we have February 1, I think we’re going to do really well in Iowa. We’re leading in the Iowa polls now and leading pretty good. And Cruz is in second place. He got really pummeled last night. Actually, I’m glad I wasn’t there. He got pummeled. Wow. And you know, they didn’t even mention that he was born in Canada. Right? You know, when you’re born in Canada, you’re not supposed to be running for president of the United States. Prime minister of Canada, no problem. He can run for Canada. There he is. He can run prime minister of Canada, no problem. " "So he got beaten up pretty badly last night," he continued. "I don’t know what’s going to happen to his poll numbers, but probably they’re not going up. I was told ours went up because of what he did last night. Isn’t that something? You know, it tells you a little bit about risk. Risk is interesting. In theory, I would have rather done the debate. You’re leading. You don’t want to change the wheels, right? You want to just go, get it done, win and go to the next one, and I took a chance. I mean, I took a chance, and it’s something you have to do. I took a chance and we did something. I don’t know what the end result was. Whatever the result is, I did the right thing. I did the right thing because I did something great for veterans. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
