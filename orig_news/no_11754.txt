Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is improving his favorability rating among white Protestant Republicans. [From February through May, 57 percent of highly religious Republicans held a favorable view of Trump. But as of June, Trump’s favorability rating with highly religious Republicans increased nine points to 66 percent, according to a new Gallup poll.  The increase in support comes the week after Trump met with roughly 1, 000 religious leaders in New York City. Gallup’s Frank Newport notes that this highly religious group "remains no more likely to view Trump favorably than are white Protestant Republicans who are moderately or not religious. " The Gallup survey was conducted through telephone interviews from June   and has a plus or minus two percent margin of error.
