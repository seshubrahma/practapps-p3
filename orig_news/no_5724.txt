During Tuesday’s "Fox  Friends," conservative talker Laura Ingraham discussed President Donald Trump’s proposed Obamacare reform, saying the new bill is missing the elements that Trump said it would have.  "The   of the health care reform, the   parts of it were transparency and pricing, competition across state lines, and even on the edges, repealing the McCarran —  Ferguson Act   …     where is that?" Ingraham said. "I don’t see any transparency and control of skyrocketing prices of health care. I certainly don’t see competition across state lines. And the drug companies, no provisions about that as far as I can see. " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
