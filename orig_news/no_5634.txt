During a press conference on Wednesday,   Donald Trump refused to take a question from CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta and told him "You are fake news. "  After Trump criticized CNN for its recent report on Russia and him, Acosta asked if, since Trump was attacking them, CNN could ask a question. Trump stated, "Your organization is terrible.   …     Don’t be rude. No, I’m not going to give you a question.   …     You are fake news. " Acosta replied that this wasn’t appropriate. Later in the press conference, Trump did take a question from CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
