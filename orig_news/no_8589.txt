Steven T. Dennis at Bloomberg Politics reports Hillary Clinton’s campaign will join the recount process in battleground states despite admitting they doubt it will change the results of the election:  Hillary Clinton’s campaign lawyer announced plans to participate in vote recounts of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan if they take place, yet doesn’t expect to overturn the election of Donald Trump as president.   …     The Democrat’s campaign didn’t plan to initiate recounts on its own because it hasn’t found "any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology," Elias wrote. Elias also isn’t expecting the recounts to erase what he said was a 107, 000 combined vote margin separating the candidates in the three battleground states and overturning the election of Trump, who is due to be sworn in as president in January.
