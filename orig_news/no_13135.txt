" She says she will ban the box and combat systemic racism. After blasting Trump for his comments about unemployment in   communities, she admits that youth unemployment for   youth is twice as high as that of white Americans. 7:00: In Kansas City, Clinton says that people who look at the   community and only see "poverty, crime, and despair are missing so much.

This is further proof Hillary Clinton will do or say anything to get elected. " 5:23: Proceeds for Clinton and Kaine’s "Stronger Together" book are going to charity, but "not the Clinton Foundation," @jmpalmieri says.  —   Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) September 8, 2016,  5:20: MSNBC’s Chuck Todd concedes that Clinton sounds too lawyerly and speaks like she is trying to convince 12 jurors. Again, if Trump would sound more like an   instead of an insecure person in need of compliments and pats on the head (see: Putin’s comments) he could present Americans with a clear contrast in the debates. 5:15: Clinton to address National Baptist Convention in Kansas City later tonight: At Bartle Hall for the Arrival of @HillaryClinton to speak at the National Baptist Convention USA. @41ActionNews pic. twitter.   —   Darrius Smith (@iamDSMITH86) September 8, 2016,  5:10: 1 set of rules for her, 1 for us:  @HillaryClinton Slams Trump But Blabbed About Briefing In 08@NBCNewshttps:  .   —   Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) September 8, 2016,  4:20: When do media outlets ever do the same against a Democrat?

This ALL about view that he was soft on DT.  —   Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) September 8, 2016,  . @realDonaldTrump clearly won last night, so of course the Left blames Matt Lauer, not Hillary.

" He will also support merit pay for teachers and blasts the tenure system where the "bad ones" are making more than the "good ones. " Trump also blasts a political system where politicians are rewarded for how many donors they or how many journalists they know and not "how many Americans they help to live better and more prosperous lives. " He says Clinton will take the votes of those in the inner cities for granted, Trump says if Clinton gets elected, "She might even say, see ya in four years, suckers. Because that’s what it is."  —   Emily Stephenson (@ewstephe) September 8, 2016,  2:50: Trump cites "astronomical" numbers of   children living in poverty and he says that "we’ve all seen the tragic rise in crime in these communities, which remains one of the greatest barriers in fostering opportunity and success. " He says many of these cities look like "places of war. " He speaks about needing dollars to follow students re: school choice. He says this has to be a "shared national mission" to bring hope to every child. He vows to use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for more school choice. 2:43: Quinnipiac state polls: Quinnipiac: Clinton+5 in PA, Clinton+4 in NC, Tie in Fl, Trump+4 in Ohio in the four way https:  .   —   Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) September 8, 2016,  2:40: Trump says it’s time to "rebuild America" and "take out ISIS. " He says Clinton is clueless about job creation. And he says that too many in the inner cities have not been included in the American Dream. He says his goal as president will be to ensure that every child be placed on the ladder to success. He says the ladder rests on a fundamental foundation —  "we need safety. There’s such danger in our inner cities. " Trump says every kid must be able to grow up in a safe community because "you can’t have prosperity without security. " He is also blasting the   education bureaucracy that is protecting   bureaucrats. Trump says he wants every child in the inner cities to attend the school of their choice. Trump says it’s a matter of putting "students first" and not the "education bureaucracy. " 2:32: Trump says Clinton believes in "globalism" and "not Americanism. " He blasts Clinton for saying no American died in Libya and says the biggest difference in the race is Iraq —  Clinton supported it while he opposed it.

He points out that the FBI discovered that foreign agents hacked into the accounts of those with whom she regularly communicated. Trump says this is why Clinton is "unfit" to become president. He also says Clinton failed to take responsibility for her Middle East policy that has unleashed radical Islam terrorists across the world. 2:20: Pence is asked what is the biggest misconception about Donald Trump. He speaks about Trump’s "graciousness" and "kindness" away from the cameras. Pence reflects on family wknd   Trump before selection. Daughter Charlotte said after: "Well he was trump all weekend  —   but he’s so nice. "  —   Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) September 8, 2016,  2:05: Trump holding an education roundtable in Cleveland before delivering his education speech. 2:00:  Trump will speak to families of victims of illegal aliens in Houston on Sept. 17 at The Remembrance Project National Conference Luncheon. "Donald Trump has met with and listened to our families’ stories of loss and grief and has pledged to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws in order to stop the preventable killings of Americans and permanently separating them from their loved ones," Maria Espinoza,   and National Director of The Remembrance Project, said. "We are grateful for Mr. Trump’s support and excited that he is honoring our work and the memories of stolen lives by speaking at this first ever National Conference. Someone is finally listening to American and legal immigrant families!" 1:56: Pence says when Trump sees huge crowds, he tells him, "this is a movement. And it’s bigger than us.

They are honest, tough, and believe in the what has always made America strong, he says. Pence says Reagan’s bluntness ushered in a GOP landslide because "he meant it. And so does Donald Trump. " He compares Reagan Democrats to "Trumpocrats. " Pence says Trump has the "toughness to rebuild our economy and command the respect of the world. " 1:48: Pence reminds the audience that Reagan wanted to be President in 1976 so he could meet with the Soviet leader and ask him what it would take for America to get along with the Soviets  …     and then whisper in his ear, "Nyet!" 1:47: Pence points out that the "smart set" dismissed Reagan as a "simpleton" and an "entertainer who entered politics late in life. " He says union members and   Democrats leaned in and listened to Reagan’s eloquence and the common sense of the uncommonly talented man. He says Ronald Reagan spoke the truth to the American people just like Donald Trump has. [Trump is no Reagan, but the same types of people on both sides of the aisle who initially hated Reagan are the same types who dislike Trump.] 1:45: Pence says he always say Reagan as a "solutions conservative. " He says Reagan’s principles still work when you put them into practice. Pence says "it’s exactly the kind of leadership Donald Trump is going to bring to Washington, D. C. when he is elected president. " 1:42: Another campaign theme that would be much more productive than "I’m so flattered that Putin may have called me brilliant. " My father has created REAL jobs. The only jobs Hillary has created were for lobbyists and maybe a few to delete her emails! #Trump2016,  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 8, 2016,  1:38: Pence shares moving and wonderful story he often tells of when he first met Ronald Reagan in the Blue Room in 1988. Pence remembers telling his wife that Reagan was the reason he became a Republican. He shook Reagan’s hand and felt like he was talking to Mount Rushmore. Pence thanked Reagan for inspiring his generation to believe in his country again and Pence believes that Reagan blushed and said, "well, Mike, that’s a nice thing to say. " 1:35: She seems to concede that the public perceives her as a "cold" and "unemotional" person who lacks empathy. "I don’t view myself as cold or unemotional."

" Why in the world is Trump again letting the world know how much he loves being flattered by Putin and giving her an opportunity to say these lines and prevent yet another opportunity for her to face a   press after all of her whoppers at the    forum? All Trump needed to say was that nice comments from foreign leaders will in no way influence any of his decisions. The less Trump speaks (like someone who is just winging it, Trump often seems like he has to fill up time when it may be best to just give short, succinct answers and not talk as much) the better it may be for him in the debates. Clinton keeps turning the ball over to Trump. Imagine if Trump would stop throwing it back to her on the next play. Hillary Clinton repudiates Trump’s praise for Putin as "unpatriotic, insulting, scary, and dangerous" https:  .   —   ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 8, 2016,  1:10: "Sources" slamming Lauer as a "disaster" would only happen if Clinton performed poorly.

She says she has a "special plan" for Historically black colleges and universities. She says voting rights are "under attack" in North Carolina.

"  If Kim   praises Trump, will he say he is a great leader because he won 100% of the vote?

We’ll see during the debates. Clinton’s team is often very predictable, and it should be easy for Trump to prepare for Clinton’s playbook if his team knows how to do basic scouting. Case in point. Tweet from last night:   GOPer emails: "every R candidate should be asked if they agree with Trump that Putin is better president than our president"  —   Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 8, 2016,  Clinton at this morning’s "press conference": BREAKING: Clinton: Every Republican in office should be asked if they agree with Trump’s comments about US generals, praise for Putin.  —   The Associated Press (@AP) September 8, 2016,  12:05: Clinton could have been more on the defensive. But Trump’s bizarre comments about Putin once again showed that Trump just can’t get out of his own way.
