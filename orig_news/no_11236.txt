On Sunday’s broadcast of NBC’s "Meet The Press," newly elected Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) said the Senate Democrats are not going to help   Donald Trump "build his wall. "  When asked where Democrats they should oppose Trump, Schumer said, "Well, my test is the specifics. We’re not going to work with him for the sake of working with him. We’re not going to oppose him just because he says  —   it’s something that Trump sponsors. Let me give you a couple examples on both sides. Surprisingly, on certain issues, candidate Trump voiced very progressive and populist opinions: changing our trade laws dramatically, a large infrastructure bill, cleaning up the swamp in Washington. These are things that Democrats have always stood for and frankly Republicans have always been against. We’re going to challenge we will challenge President Trump to work with us on that. If he doesn’t, he will break his promise of blue collar workers, many of whom voted for him on those issues. " "On issues where our values are at stake, the president goes in a divisive direction, where his campaign did before, we will go against him and with everything we’ve got," he continued. "We’re not going to repeal or help him repeal Obamacare. We are not going to roll back  . They should forget about that. We have 60 votes to block them. We’re not going to help him build his wall. We have a comprehensive immigration bill that builds tougher border security. We’re not going to oppose him just because it’s Trump. We’re going to stick to our values and oppose him where where he opposes those. I hope on the promises he made to blue collar America, on trade, on carried interest, on infrastructure, that he will stick with them and work with us even if it means breaking with the Republicans who have always opposed these things.
