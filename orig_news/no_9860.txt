A large truck has stormed through a Christmas market in the German capital of Berlin killing 12 people and injuring many others. A    recent migrant has been released after police concluded he was not a suspect, and officers are now hunting a Tunisian immigrant. [UPDATE 14. 30 GMT  —   Statement by German Chancellor Angela Merkel,  I express my gratitude to the Italian authorities and police, and for our close collaboration. I wish the police officer who was injured in the shooting a speedy recovery. Security officers work together across borders and terrorism is a challenge for all of us. It is good to know that we are very determined in Europe and beyond to fight it. The grief and sympathy for those killed injured goes far beyond Germany. The investigation is not yet over. In Berlin, the intelligence bureau will be investigating. I know we will not rest until we know who had possibly helped [Anis Amri]. We will take on Islamist terrorism. We will adjust our safety and security policies to reflect those challenges but for now there are questions like how Amri reached Germany. Therefore, I ask Thomas de Maizière, the German interior minister, to collaborate with the federal states in Germany and the security agencies to analyse every detail and to provide results as soon as possible. Then, political and legal adjustments will be made. Furthermore, I spoke to my colleague in Tunisia, and Tunisia and Germany have intensified the collaboration against terrorism. Those who have no right to reside in Germany will face consequences. We will accelerate measures to remove those who are not allowed to reside in Germany. It is the responsibility of the German government to maintain the safety of citizens and we will do our utmost to make sure the state of security in our country. We will work towards this intensively and you can rely on this. Our values will be stronger than the hate values of terrorism.

Amri, who escaped, encountered a police control point at 3am. He started to fire his weapon and he was then shot by Italian police. Italian authorities already made fingerprint checks and confirmed the identification of the subject. I have expressed my gratitude to my colleague in Italy, and congratulated him on the success of Italian authorities and police. I also expressed that the police officers were very professional and very brave. A special team will be sent to Italy to collaborate with Italian authorities in an investigation. I thank them for their very close cooperation. This manhunt which ended a success of course does not mean an end because we still have to investigate further. Unfortunately, the terror threat in Germany has not changed. It is still at ‘high risk’ and the security agencies are working close together. I would like to point out my deportation proposals and would like to make more proposals for safety and security. My thoughts are with those family members of the victims and those in the hospital. For them, today’s success cannot replace their loss. Our thoughts are with them. UPDATE 10. 25 GMT  —   Italian interior minister confirms suspect killed: Last night at 3am in Milan during the usual routine control activities, a state police squad stopped someone who appeared to be a suspect. At the moment when he was stopped, the man without hesitating took out a pistol from his rucksack and shot the police officer that asked him for identification. The other officer immediately responded. The person that attacked our patrol was killed. After a number of enquiries it has been determined without a shadow of a doubt that he is Anis Amri, the presumed suspect of a terrorist attack in Berlin. The police officer who was shot is Christian Morio. Morio was hurt and is in hospital. He is recovering and is not in intensive care. Allow me to thank all the security teams in our country. Italy must be really proud of them. I’d like to thank them from the bottom of my heart. This was done in an atmosphere of cooperation and we were able to ensure a high level of security across the country. The fact that we were able to identify this person and neutralise him really means there is a system that is capable of functioning. The operation is not finished. There are inquiries and we are working hand in hand with the legal system. We will not go into details because for obvious reasons this could lead to other developments. We are in communication with the German authorities. These two officers were very young and rendered an extraordinary service to their community. I feel I can say to these two young officers that Italy is grateful to them.

Over the last days I have been very proud of how reflective the people have been and how circumspect the people have been. I wish everyone here the best of success. Our thoughts are with you". Besides the platitudes and remarks on German society, the three senior statesmen at the press conference had nothing to say, other than the fact the fingerprints of the wanted man Anis Amri had been found on the truck. The lack of new information may be taken as an indication of the amount of progress the investigation has had so far, after the suspected killer was accidentally given a days   by German police who arrested the wrong man.  UPDATE 12:30  —   Criminal past of suspected killer, More details about the suspected Berlin Christmas market killer, including his arrest for arson after burning down a school and migrant camp in Italy, his connections with radical Salafists in Germany, and place on the United State’s   ‘ ’ list.

As reported by Breitbart London, these   devices as commonly deployed outside government buildings in the West and military bases in places like Afghanistan and Iraq were deployed to many British Christmas markets weeks ago following intelligence of planned attacks. Pictures: Concrete barriers deployed by volunteers of the Federal Agency for Technical Relief, part of the Civil Defence establishment.     Getty Images, UPDATE 10:00  —   German police deny arrests, After Germany’s Bild published images of arrests taking place in Dortmund, the Federeal Prosecutor has now denied any such thing taking place, reports Welt. Speaking to press, a spokesman said "No, that is not so  …     we are not aware of any arrest". The prosecutor would not provide any information on what happened in Dortmund. UPDATE 09:30 GMT THURSDAY  —   Arrests and raids across Germany, On the third day after the Berlin attacks that took the lives of 12, German police have raided migrants homes in Emmerich and Dortmund. News sources including Germany’s Bild reports four individuals were arrested and taken into custody during the raid, and that these detainees are contacts of the wanted Tunisian Anis Amri. Breitbart London reported in August on a large number of arrests as part of a major crackdown on radical Islamists in Germany. One of those arrested was Dortmund based Serbian Islam convert who was regarded by law enforcement as "highly conspirative" and distributed Islamic State propaganda. He has now been reported to be an associate of suspected killer Anis Amri. UPDATE 15:20 GMT  —   Suspected killer wasn’t deported because he had no papers, Ralf Jäger, the controversial   home affairs minister for the state of North   has spoken in a press conference this afternoon on the background of suspected killer Anis A, who lived at least part of the time in the state. When asked by a journalist why the Tunisian migrant hadn’t been deported despite having failed in his application for asylum, the politician responded: "the man could not be deported because he had no valid identity papers". This refers to a common paradox in German immigration policy, where asylum seekers have their claims rejected for not being from a sufficiently dangerous country but can’t be returned because they have lost or destroyed their legitimate identity papers   to Europe. Without these papers, their countries of origin refuse to take the failed asylum seekers back as it can’t be proven the individuals did come from that country in the first place. In this common situation, migrants are then issued with papers of tolerance, which signify the fact their claims have failed but while they have nowhere else to go they are permitted to remain in Germany. Ralf Jäger gained international prominence earlier this year during the aftermath of the Cologne sexual assaults, which happened on his watch as home affairs minister for the state. Minister Jäger managed to hang on to his own position after firing his chief of police to boost public confidence in the force. It later transpired that the police chief had appealed to Minister Jäger for reinforcements on the night of the mass sex assaults but was turned down. UPDATE 14:45 GMT  —   Germany to introduce   for Islamists in wake of Berlin attack, Interior Minister Heiko Maas has said the German government is considering expanding rules surrounding   tracking devices following reports the suspected killer in the Berlin attack was a known extremist who avoided criminal proceedings for violence this Summer by absconding.

Presently, ankle bracelets are only permissible for individuals under suspicion if they have already served a three year term for violence or sexual assault, reports Welt. UPDATE 14:00 GMT  —   Police investigating tweets blaming Merkel for terror killing, Breitbart London reported yesterday on the remarks of senior Alternative for Germany (AfD) member Marcus Pretzell, who Tweeted: "When will the German state of law strike back? When will this cursed hypocrisy finally stop? These are Merkel’s dead! ". Mr. Pretzel’s AfD is Germany’s most vocal   migration party, and has previously warned opening the nation’s borders would make it vulnerable to terror attack. Now Welt reports Munich police are investigating the tweet for potentially criminal comments: @StephDammi Danke für den Hinweis, wir werden den Tweet strafrechtlich prüfen lassen. Viele Grüße vom Social Media Team der Polizei München,  —   Polizei München (@PolizeiMuenchen) December 20, 2016,  Yet the politician has responded   to the complaints that let to the investigation, remarking "Offending our leader?

Known to go by at least four aliases the man is known to be dangerous, and has links to a known extremist Islamist network. He was investigated by police during the summer over a case of greivous bodily harm but was never prosecuted as he absconded. Anis A applied for asylum in April 2015, reports Süddeutsche Zeitung, and although he was not successful the Tunisian migrant received papers confirming his tolerated foreigner status. Traces of his DNA have been found in the cab of the truck that was used to kill 12 on Monday evening.  UPDATE 10:30 GMT WEDNESDAY  —   POLICE HUNTING TUNISIAN SUSPECT, German police are now seeking a new suspect after releasing the    Pakistani male last night. According to information received by Germany’s Spiegel, investigators found an identity document for a    Tunisian immigrant named as Anis A. tucked under the driver’s seat in the cab of the lorry. The paper reports the migrant is known to use aliases including Ahmed A. The document is a certificate of tolerance  —   a paper issued by the German government to recognise a temporary right to remain for failed asylum seekers who don’t have otherwise legitimate travel documents  —   and was processed in North  . There will be another press conference in Berlin at lunchtime today. UPDATE 14:59 EST  —    The Pakistani asylum seeker has been freed from custody and police say he is no longer a suspect in the attack.

The director of the freight shipping company and cousin to Luke U. Ariel Zurawski, has spoken to journalists remarking that he last had contact with his relative on Monday afternoon to tell him unloading of his cargo had been suspended until Tuesday, and that he would have to stay with his truck in Berlin overnight. A GPS tracker on the vehicle showed Luke U then parked the truck near the company which was to receive the steel on Tuesday. Company manager Ariel Zurawski said that during the conversation with his cousin he remarked the district he had parked in was "full of Muslims" and the only Germans to be found were in the company office, reports Spiegel. Mr Zurawski said he was "not happy" that he had to stay in Berlin longer than necessary  —   the driver had hoped to return to Poland on Monday rather than Tuesday. The last information he got from the driver was that he was leaving his vehicle to get something to eat. At around 5pm, neither Luke U. ’s wife nor Mr. Zurawski could not get in touch with him. He remarked: "I knew that something had to be wrong, because he always took calls. He was my cousin. I can vouch for it because he was a decent man, husband, father of a child". Spiegel reports that according to the truck’s GPS data, someone had started the vehicle on Monday three times  —   even though it should have remained stationary until unloading on Tuesday.

UPDATE 14:10 GMT  —    The head of Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office Holger Munch, who just last month reassured Germans that the government had no "concrete evidence" of a terror attack being planned, speaking at a press conference responded to a press question over whether there might be another armed perpetrator on the loose in Berlin or elsewhere. He said: "Currently we have one suspect but we’re not sure if he is the perpetrator and we don’t know whether here is the only one. "We have not found the weapon and that leads us to be in a high state of alert. Obviously our investigations are ongoing into various directions, to discover if there are other perpetrators and if so to arrest them". UPDATE 14:00 GMT  —   German state prosecutor speaks, clarifying wrong suspect situation, Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday lunchtime, Germany’s chief Federal prosecutor Peter Frank has shone some light on rumours and unconfirmed press reports that police had accidentally arrested the wrong man  —   the 23 year old Pakistani citizen presently held in custody denies involvement. Although he did not say the arrested man was the wrong suspect, the prosecutor remarked: "We don’t have anybody claiming responsibility so we are not 100% sure over the background at this stage. "Investigations are ongoing, and we are coopering with the Federal Investigation Bureau [BKA] and Berlin, we are carrying out investigations, looking at the lorry, gathering witness statements, and analysing them. We are looking at video footage from the scene and the street the lorry came down, and we are carrying out an investigation into the Polish lorry driver, "We don’t know    if there was one perpetrator or several, and we don’t know if they have been supported. We might have to get used to the idea that the person, a citizen of Pakistan detained last night  …     perhaps he might not be the perpetrator, or part of the group of perpetrators". "When we get more relevant information, we will bring the public up to date". So far, all six of the identified victims of the attack are German citizens. UPDATE 13:00 GMT  —   Claims that German police aren’t sure they arrested the right suspect, German media sources reported this morning police had arrested a    Pakistani male and were treating him as their prime suspect. Now Germany’s Welt reports there is some doubt they have the right man, citing unnamed "high ranking security" sources. This source told the paper: "We have the wrong man  …     the real culprit is still armed and at large, and can cause more damage". Despite the alarming claim, which was made as Berlin’s chief of police and other senior   officials sat in a press conference at lunchtime today, the chief made no mention of these concerns. He remarked: "Investigation are still ongoing. We are comparing the DNA of the possible culprit to samples taken from the driver’s cab, but that isn’t finished yet  …     we are still searching the lorry for clues we can use". UPDATE 12:45 GMT  —   Berlin leaders speak at Mayor’s press conference  —   "could have been a drunk driver" Speaking at a press conference hosted by Michael Müller, Berlin’s   mayor, the city chief of police Klaus Kandt refused to answer questions from assembled press about Islamic terror, remarking: "We have to keep a complete open mind, it could have been a drunk driver crashing". His remarks contradict those of German interior minister Thomas de Maizière, who just minutes before the Berlin press conference began told reporters there was "no doubt" it was an attack, rather than an accident, reports Zeit. Sitting beside the police officer at the press conference, Berlin mayor Müller remarked: "and yet again we have an attack on our freedom  …     [by] enemies of our freedom. He said the Brandunburg gate would be a centre for mourning tonight, reflecting: "The gate has been lit in the colours of places affected by terrorism in the past, but today it will be lit in our own colours". Emphasisng the importance of multicultural Berlin, the mayor said: "it wouldn’t be Berlin without people of all nations living together, and this is especially important [at this time]". Berlin’s flags are to fly at half mast today.

Thanking the emergency services for their work since last night in responding to and investigating the event, she said: "Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very difficult day  …     twelve people who were looking forward to Christmas and had plans for the festive season are no longer among us. This is a terrible deed that one cannot understand  …     many people who are injured are fighting for their lives. "We don’t know anything for certain but we must assume it was a terrorist attack. It would be very difficult for us to learn that the person who committed this deed came to Germany to ask for refuge and asylum". Merkel made special mention of the many thousands of migrant helpers in Germany, the volunteers who give their time in migrant centres and have campaigned to keep the nation’s borders open to newcomers. Addressing the shock that the killer was likely one of their own wards, the Chancellor said: "It would be terrible for all the Germans who are very active every day helping asylum and refugees. It would be repugnant for them, those who help those who have come to this country to ask for our help". "Millions of people are asking themselves how can we celebrate a festival of life when someone has come along and taken so many lives. We cannot live with it, and do these things without the Christmas markets, without spending a pleasant time outside with our friends and families  …     we do not want to be paralysed by terror.
