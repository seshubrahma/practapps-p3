Author Diana West reacts to Brent Bozell declaring that Roger Stone should be "shunned by the media. "[From DianaWest. net:  To: Brent Bozell, I read the statement you made as president of the Media Research Center, applauding CNN and MSNBC for banning Trump supporter Roger Stone from their presidential election coverage. CNN, Politico reports, banned Stone in February over his tweets about Jeb Bush supporter and CNN analyst Ana Navarro (Stone called her "Entitled Diva Bitch," "Borderline retarded," and "dumber than dog s —  " [stet]).

He is the David Duke of politics. Those with whom he is affiliated should denounce him in no uncertain terms. Having seized these   heights of    —   which has nothing to do with your visceral opposition to Donald Trump (whom Stone supports)  —   I will assume this is only your first step. That is, Stone Standard in hand, you must be now turning your cleansing energies toward the rest of the Right, where public rhetoric of crudity and intimidation very often exceeds that of former CNN and MSNBC commentator Roger Stone, Hated One.
