 (CNN) Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign raised $143 million in August for her campaign, the DNC and state parties, according to a campaign press release, a haul that makes the month the best of her campaign. The fundraising haul is a silver lining on what otherwise was a difficult month for Clinton, where questions about her exclusive use of a private email server as secretary of state and questions about    at the Clinton Foundation hamstrung her campaign. National polls have tightened since the Democratic National Convention in July, but Clinton maintains leads in almost all battleground states. With their massive August haul, the Clinton campaign starts September with more than $68 million in the bank, while her joint fundraising accounts have a combined $84 million in the bank. Clinton campaign unmoved by press squawks over lack of press conferences, "Thanks to the 2. 3 million people who have contributed to our campaign, we are heading into the final two months of the race with the resources we need to organize and mobilize millions of voters across the country," Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement. "These resources will help us to register and turnout millions of voters to elect progressive candidates across the country." For comparison,  . Barack Obama raised Obama’s campaign raised $66 million in August 2008 and $150 million in September 2008. Clinton headlined 37 fundraisers in August, raising her campaign close to $70 million in the process, according to CNN’s estimate based on average ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the Clinton campaign. Clinton’s events    which took her to 12 states    raised $67. 9 million, according to CNN’s calculations. That haul smashes what she has personally raised during previous months and put her on pace to make August her biggest fundraising month of the campaign.

These agreements allow Clinton’s donors to give $366, 400 to a number of different Democratic accounts through the Clinton campaign.
