Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton in the USC   Angeles Times "Daybreak" poll for the first time since Aug. 3  â€”   the last day he had an edge on the former secretary of state. [Although the race remains too close to call, Trump is roughly half a point in front of Clinton, 44. 2 percent to 43. 6 percent.  The survey questioned 2, 463 voters. The daily tracking poll questions roughly 3, 000 eligible voters through Nov. 8, election day, on which presidential candidate they support. The data is weighed from the previous week, so the results can lag with major events within the campaign.
