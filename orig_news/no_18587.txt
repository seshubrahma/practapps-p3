’  mogul Donald Trump ended his   campaign rally by calling for an end to     zones on schools and US military bases.’ ’"I will get rid of   zones on schools  —   you have to  —   and on military bases on my first day. It gets signed my first day," the Republican presidential   told his supporters in Burlington, Vermont.’ ’"You know what a   zone is to a sicko?" Trump asked. "That’’s bait. "’ "Trump’s rally was occurring at the same time as US President Barack Obama’s televised   forum addressing gun violence. Obama has repeatedly called for   measures after recent mass shootings and  to expand background checks on gun buyers, among other things." ’But Trump argues that more people need to be carrying arms to protect the innocent.’ ’His allusion to   military bases was apparently a reference to the attacks against two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, last July. His   schools comment could have been referring to the mass shooting at an Oregon community college last October, though concealed firearms .’ "But far more of Trump’s Thursday   discussion was about the recent terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Paris. Both of those incidents, he suggested, would have been easily thwarted if those areas had looser   laws and an armed public." ’"They walk into a number of places in France, and they say, ’’Get over. ’’ Boom. ’’Get over. ’’ Boom. ’’Get over. ’’ Boom. Nobody had a gun on the other side," Trump recalled. If the people there were armed, he said, "It’’s a whole different outcome. It’’s a whole different deal. "’ ’He added: "You’’ll have bad stuff happening, but at least we’’re shooting back. And we’’re going down shooting. "’
