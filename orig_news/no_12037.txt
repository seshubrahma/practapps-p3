Saturday, Maria Hinojosa, anchor and executive producer of NPR’s "Latino USA," responded on MSNBC’s "AM Joy" to Donald Trump surrogate Steve Cortes saying "illegal immigrants" by comparing the phrase to the Holocaust Jews being labeled as "illegal people. "  "What you can do is you can say it is an immigrant living illegally or an immigrant living without papers or without documents in this country," Hinojosa said while interrupting Cortes. "But what you cannot do is to label a person illegal. And the reason why I say this is not because I learned it from some radical Latino or Latina studies professor when I was a college student. I learned it from Elie Wiesel, who survived the Holocaust, who said, ‘You know what, the first thing they did was that they declared the Jews to be an illegal people. ’" Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
