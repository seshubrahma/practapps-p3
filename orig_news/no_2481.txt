(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.   Donald J. Trump began a victory lap, heading to Indiana to celebrate both his win and his seeming success at preventing some manufacturing jobs in the state from moving to Mexico. The deal with Carrier, best known for its   saves 1, 000 jobs through a $7 million incentive package  —   just the kind of corporate giveaway he knocked on the campaign trail. Afterward, he went to a rally in Ohio, where he announced the selection of James Mattis, an   with a tough stance on Iran, to be his defense secretary. _____ 2. Some of Mr. Trump’s supporters say he is risking charges of hypocrisy for filling his cabinet with people of wealth and power  —   the very kinds of people he vowed to drive out of Washington. The consideration of Mitt Romney, above, for secretary of state has been the most infuriating to conservative leaders who wanted to see Mr. Trump shake up the party establishment. Some have mounted a vigorous lobbying campaign to try to usher David H. Petraeus, the former C. I. A. director, into the job. _____ 3. The first recount of the 2016 presidential election is underway in Wisconsin, above. Few people expect the effort, initiated by Jill Stein, to reverse the election’s outcome. Another recount will begin Friday in the neighboring battleground state of Michigan. _____ 4. A measure to extend sanctions against Iran for a decade was passed by the Senate and will now go to President Obama, who has not said whether he intends to sign or to veto the legislation. The    vote showed the desire of lawmakers to maintain a tough posture toward Iran amid uncertainty over the future of the nuclear agreement with the country, which Mr. Trump railed against during his campaign. Iranian officials have threatened to respond if the United States goes through with the extension. Above, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. _____ 5. The United Nations apologized for its role in the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti that led to the deaths of about 10, 000 people. Secretary General Ban   in his address to the General Assembly, implicitly acknowledged that the disease was not present in the country until the arrival of U. N. peacekeepers from Nepal, where cholera is common. _____ 6. President François Hollande stunned France, announcing he would not run for a second term in next year’s election. Mr. Hollande, a Socialist, has had some of the worst approval ratings in France’s modern history. He has struggled to cut unemployment and has had to grapple with agonizing terrorist attacks. _____ 7. The process to demobilize FARC rebels in Colombia can begin now that a revised peace accord ending the country’s   civil war has been ratified. This time the government bypassed voters, who had turned down the accord by a narrow margin on Oct. 2. In coming weeks, the rebels will leave their camps and relocate to a set number of sites, where they’ll disarm under the watch of United Nations inspectors. _____ 8. Psilocybin, an ingredient found in hallucinogenic mushrooms, can significantly reduce anxiety and depression in cancer patients, according to a study published today. The drug has been illegal in the United States for more than 40 years. "I have a greater sense of peace of what might come," one cancer survivor said. "I’m very grateful, beyond words, for this trial. " _____ 9. Jim Delligatti, above, the McDonald’s franchise owner who created the Big Mac, died on Monday. He was 98. In the   Mr. Delligatti’s initial proposal to add a   hamburger to the menu was met with resistance. Today, the company sells about 550 million Big Macs in the United States every year. "All I got was a plaque," Mr. Delligatti said in 2007. _____ 10. Tiger Woods made his   comeback to golf at the Hero World Challenge, his first competitive round in more than a year  —   466 days, to be exact. He had been sidelined by back injuries, watching his ranking plummet to 898th while he was away. Woods, now 40, showed flashes of his old self on the course Thursday, but finished over par. _____ 11. One of our   stories is about a fortune that went missing when a wealthy businessman set out to divorce his wife. The quest to find it would reveal the depths of an offshore financial system used by the richest people in the world for one main purpose: to make it appear that they own as little as possible. "Dictators use it to loot their own countries. Drug lords use it to launder money," our reporter wrote. The system "is a darkness that shields the   businessman and the criminal alike. " _____ 12. Finally, we have reached the last month of 2016. December will usher in holiday decorations, party invitations, airport congestion and, most likely, an overwhelming number of   lists. Here’s one to kick things off: the 10 best books of 2016, selected by editors of The New York Times Book Review. Enjoy. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
