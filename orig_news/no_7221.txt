Going forward, every piece about Republican frontrunner Donald Trump published at the   Huffington Post will now include a note attacking the billionaire businessman as "a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims," according to Politico.  "Yes, we’re planning to add this note to all future stories about Trump," the spokesperson said. "No other candidate has called for banning 1. 6 billion people from the country! If any other candidate makes such a proposal, we’ll append a note under pieces about them. " The full HuffPo note reads: Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims  —   1. 6 billion members of an entire religion  —   from entering the U. S. For much of the presidential campaign season, the Huffington Post was ridiculed widely for refusing to cover Trump as a serious presidential candidate. Even after Trump had dominated the GOP field for months,  the Huffington Post, which sells itself a serious news outlet, would only publish stores about the frontunner on its entertainment vertical. No word yet on whether or not the Huffington Post will add a note to stories about Hillary Clinton to remind readers that the   of State is a  …             Classified   Foreign   Tool of Wall Street and America’s First Birther.
