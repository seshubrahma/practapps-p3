Comedian Wanda Sykes confronted a Boston audience Saturday night after she was booed for making disparaging comments about   Donald Trump at a charity   comedy event. [The    comedian and actress was about five minutes into her set at the Cam Neely Foundation’s 22nd annual Comics Come Home fundraiser at TD Garden when she was loudly booed for attacking Trump.  "It’s going to be okay," Sykes had said. "I am certain this is not the first time we’ve elected a racist, sexist, homophobic president. He ain’t the first one. He’s just the first confirmed one. " When the comment caused many in the audience to jeer, Sykes appeared to shout expletives at some individuals in the audience and later flipped them the middle finger. "The evidence is there," she added as the crowd began to boo. "How could you say he’s not racist? Grab them by the p*ssy? How could you say he’s not sexist?" (Warning: Strong Language) Sykes reportedly stayed onstage to finish her performance despite the booing, according to the Boston Herald. The paper reported that comedian Nick DiPaolo was also booed over political material in his set. The annual Comics Come Home fundraiser features local   comics and is held to raise money for adult and child cancer patients and their families. Sykes is not the only comedian to have been roundly booed for making comments critical of Trump in October, hundreds of audience members reportedly stood up and walked out of an Amy Schumer concert when the comedian bashed Trump, calling him an "orange,   monster. " Schumer later read an open letter to those   fans in which she vowed she would attend rehab to learn how to "make all people happy. "   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
