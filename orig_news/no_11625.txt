Wednesday on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," Democratic strategist and Clinton ally James Carville offered his thoughts on the possibility of an election being rigged, as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and some of his supporters have suggested was a possibility.  Carville called such claims a a fundamental attack on the country. "This is a fundamental attack on the country itself the underpinning of it that somehow or another it’s rigged or it’s not fair," Carville said. "People, you know, some people believe that. " However, Carville said that a voting machine could be rigged "to get a hundred votes here or a hundred votes there. " "By in large American elections are pretty much on the up and up," he continued. "It is very, very  —   I cannot tell you that somebody can’t rig a voting machine to get a hundred votes here or a hundred votes there, that is possible. " "It’s as up and up as it can be," Carville added. "Something happens, it gets hacked this time. But by and large, you’re never surprised at something that happens.
