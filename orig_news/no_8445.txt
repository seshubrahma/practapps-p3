The D. C. GOP has launched an investigation into the eligibility of its 2016 Republican delegate Rina Shah Bharara, after Breitbart News revealed that Bharara actually lives in Virginia. ["Absolutely unacceptable. Our General Counsel is investigating the findings of your article and he will make a determination on Mrs. Bharara’s status as a DC Delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention as expeditiously as possible," DC GOP spokesman Patrick Mara told Breitbart News Monday.  Bharara recently said on Fox News that she would support Hillary Clinton if Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee, and she has also criticized both Trump and Ted Cruz after they warned of jihad threats from Muslims in the United States. Fairfax County property records show that Shah Bharara jointly owns a house in Reston, Va. with her husband Niteesh Bharara, a doctor, who bought the house on August 18 for $1. 178 million. Both Bharara and her husband were listed in Washington Post real estate records at the time of the purchase. Bharara’s Instagram page, which has since been deleted, showed that in September 2015 Bharara Instagrammed the Virginia house with the captions "#OurFirstHome, #VirginiaIsForLovers and #FinallyCrossedThePotomac. " Bharara told Breitbart News on Sunday night that she owns a registered business in Washington, D. C. but records reveal that her consulting firm Rilax Strategies is based in a condo that is owned by Bharara’s father. Reached by phone Monday, Bharara told Breitbart News, in response to both her residency status and also the statement by the DC GOP: "No comment. "
