Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 17, 2016,  Tyler was asked if Palin were to endorse Trump if it would be a "blow" to Cruz’s presidential effort, to which Tyler said it would be a "blow" to Palin instead. "I think it’d be a blow to Sarah Palin because Sarah Palin has been a champion for the conservative cause, and if she was going to endorse Donald Trump, sadly, she would be endorsing someone who’s held progressive views all their life on the sanctity of life, on marriage, on   abortion," Tyler said. "He supported TARP bailout. It goes on and on and on. Donald Trump claims he’s changed all those views. But I think if it was Sarah Palin  —   let me just say, I’d be deeply disappointed.
