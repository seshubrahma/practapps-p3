’  ’ ’   As the Trump rally rolls on, people up and down Wall Street and   around the world keep finding reasons for why it should continue. ’ "   And in a Wednesday note following Trump’s speech before a joint   session of Congress, Citigroup may have given us the worst reason   we’ve heard yet. " ’   From Citi in a section with the heading "Forget Math for   the Moment": ’ ’’ ’   Okay so lets walk through this logic here.  ’ "   Citi is saying that budget math doesn’t matter anymore, because   it hasn’t worked for so long that whatever we spend will be more   of the same.  " ’   If we just add more to the deficit, whatever. ’ "   If we spend more than we take in, that’s just par for the course. " "   It doesn’t matter if there are levels to this stuff  —   which is to   say, it doesn’t matter if we increase the deficit much more than   we did the year before, because we already had a deficit. It   doesn’t matter if we collect less revenue than we did before,   because we weren’t collecting enough before anyway. " "   Guys, no. The best way to solve a problem is not to make the   problem even bigger. You’re playing yourselves. " ’   We should not just give up on having a more balanced budget and   rational, revenue generating tax policy because. .. YOLO!* ’ ’   Now to be fair, Citi does acknowledge that there is risk of a   bust here. ’ ’   "We also have to disagree with views that the present economic   recovery has been so weak and incomplete that large scale   stimulus comes with no risk of generating a   cycle. Even   so, however, boom comes first." ’ "   And apparently they can’t see beyond the boom. That takes math.   And we’re not doing math now. If this is how analysts across Wall   Street are thinking, no wonder the market is ripping. " ’  ’ ’     ’ " *YOLO means You Only Live Once. The kids say it sometimes   when they’re about to do something that might be stupid, but   doesn’t matter. " ’As the Trump rally rolls on, people up and down. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
