Monday in Osceola, IN, Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) said he is going to stay in the Republican presidential primary race "for the distance. "  When asked if he intends to stay in the race until the GOP convention in Cleveland in July, Cruz said, "I am in for the distance. As long as we have a viable path to victory, I am competing until the end, and the reason is simple,  Listen, this isn’t about me. It isn’t about Donald Trump it isn’t about any of the candidates. This is about our country and our future. I’m not willing to give up on the Constitution and Bill of Rights. " "If Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump become president, we will see liberals on the U. S. Supreme Court and we will see the Heller decision overruled, which means the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms will be stripped away from every   American," he continued. "If we allow the next president to be Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump we’ll see the same economic stagnation and taxes rising on the American people. We will see jobs going overseas.
