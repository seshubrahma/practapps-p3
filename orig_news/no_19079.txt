’  ’ ’   Donald Trump defended his praise of Russian President Vladimir   Putin on Wednesday night by saying Putin has been more of a   leader than US President Barack Obama. ’ ’   NBC host Matt Lauer asked the Republican presidential nominee   about his past statements on the Russian leader at a televised   national security forum. ’ ’   Trump didn’’t back down from his glowing comments on Putin,   saying that if someone says "great things" about him, he’’ll   return the favor. ’ ’   "He is really very much of a leader," Trump said of Putin. "You   can say, ’’Oh, isn’t that a terrible thing,’’ I mean, the man has   very strong control over his country. Now, it’’s a very different   system, and I don’’t happen to like the system, but certainly in   that system he’’s been a leader, far more than our president has   been a leader." ’ ’   "We have a divided country," Trump concluded. ’ ’’ ’   Putin has said that Trump is "very talented," and Trump in turn   said it was a "great honor to be so nicely complimented by a   man so highly respected within his own country and beyond." ’ "   Trump has repeatedly said that if he wins the presidency in   November, he’d like to strengthen ties with Russia and work with   Putin to defeat the terrorist group ISIS.
