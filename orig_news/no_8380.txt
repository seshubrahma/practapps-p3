GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s son Donald Trump, Jr. joined Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM with host Stephen K. Bannon and said he and his father are disappointed in Fox News  —   particularly the network’s "inflammatory" and "childish" press release mocking Trump. ["It has nothing to do with Megyn Kelly," he said, of his father not attending Fox News’s GOP primary debate tonight in Des Moines, Iowa and instead holding an event for veterans. "A press release of that nature, that’s that inflammatory and that childish, that doesn’t come from a low level guy in a marketing department. "  Trump was referring to this statement put out by Fox News in response to Trump asking his Twitter followers whether or not he should attend the debate on Thursday: We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president  —   a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings. He said both him and his father didn’t think the press release was professional, as it was mocking someone who could become the next President of the United States.
