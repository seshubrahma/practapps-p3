Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s campaign stated Wednesday in a press release it raised $51 million from fundraising in the last week of May through the month of June. This comes after the campaign had been widely criticized for being behind presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in fundraising numbers last month. [According to the campaign, it received $26 million from fundraising emails and efforts.  "This was made possible with over 400, 000 supporters, with 94% of our supporters giving under $200," the campaign press release states. It continues: The first email solicitation, which contained an unprecedented $2 million match from Donald J. Trump, exceeded our goal, collecting over $3 million in contributions in one day. Donald J. Trump personally contributed $3. 8 million to the campaign this month which brings total contributions to $55 million. The results from this month show the enthusiastic movement the campaign has created. People want to invest in a better future for America and Make America Great Again! The campaign very much appreciates the broad support. The Republican National Committee (RNC) with the Trump campaign, held 22 fundraising events. These events took place "throughout the country for Trump Victory, with contributions exceeding $25 million (which includes the last week of May and June). The Campaign is committed to working with the RNC to support its important operations for the Republican Party. " The fundraising efforts came from Campaign Finance Chairman Steven Mnuchin and the RNC’s Lew Eisenberg over a short period of time. "We just started our fundraising efforts in the last week of May and we are extremely pleased with the   support in the last five weeks for the Trump Campaign and Trump Victory. We want to thank our many volunteers and contributors that are committed to electing Donald J. Trump as President in November," Mnuchin stated in the press release.
