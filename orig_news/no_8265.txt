Friday at a campaign rally in Harrington, DE, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said that some in the American media are "the world’s most dishonest people. "  Trump said, "You know we have a great time considering the subject matter is no good. Right? But when we say —  look at all those hats, right? —  "Make America Great Again. " When we say that —  you know somebody, a reporter —  by the way the world’s most dishonest people are back there. Look at all the cameras going. Look at all those cameras. It’s unbelievable. They are dishonest. Most of them. Not all of them. But Most of them. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
