Noam Chomsky tells me on @ajupfront that leftists who didn’t vote for Clinton to block Trump made a "bad mistake":pic. twitter.  In an interview with Al Jazeera’s Mehdi Hasan,   scholar Noam Chomsky said progressives who didn’t vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton made "a bad mistake" by not recognizing   Donald Trump’s "greater evil. "  Chomsky said, "I think they are making a bad mistake. First of all there is two issues. One is kind of a moral issue. Do you vote against the greater evil if you don’t happen to like the other candidate? They answer to that is yes, if you have any moral understanding, you want to keep the greater evil out. Second question is a factual question. How do Trump and Clinton compare? And I think they are very different. I didn’t like Clinton at all but her positions are much better than Trump’s on every issue I can think of. " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
