Welcome to Breitbart News’s live updates of the 2016 horse race.   —   All times eastern. Democrats caucus today in Alaska, Washington, and Hawaii. [Sunday] 8:51: Sanders win confirmed in Hawaii: (AP) Bernie Sanders netted nearly three dozen delegates after his win in Hawaii, having swept three states. It’s a solid showing, but it didn’t significantly tighten Hillary Clinton’s overall big lead. Sanders needs to win 67 percent of the remaining delegates and uncommitted superdelegates through June to be able to clinch the Democratic nomination. So far he’s only winning 37 percent. With 25 Hawaii delegates at stake, Sanders picked up 17. Clinton gained eight. That means in Saturday’s contests, Sanders won a total of 55 delegates, having also won Washington state and Alaska. Clinton picked up 20. More delegates are likely to be allocated to Sanders in several weeks, when the Washington state Democratic party releases vote shares by district. Still, Clinton maintains a wide advantage in delegates. Based on primaries and caucuses to date, she’s won 1, 243 delegates to Sanders’ 975. Clinton’s lead is even bigger when including superdelegates, or party officials who can back any candidate they wish. Including superdelegates, Clinton has 1, 712 delegates to Sanders’ 1, 004. It takes 2, 383 to win. 8:20: Hawaii caucuses under way.
