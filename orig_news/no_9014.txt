Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made up significant ground against Hillary Clinton in the past few days in the   poll, where he trailed by 12 points on Tuesday, 45% % but is now behind only 5 points, 41% %. [When four candidates are included in the poll  —   taking in Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Gary Johnson  —   Clinton’s lead narrows to just 3 points, 39% %  —   a statistical dead heat, given the poll’s margin of error of 3 points.
