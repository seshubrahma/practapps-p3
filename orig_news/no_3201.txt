Fashion designer Stefano Gabbana took to social media Tuesday to thank First Lady Melania Trump for wearing one of his Dolce  Gabbana jackets in her official White House portrait  —   and later pointedly told his critics to "go to hell. "[In a post to his Instagram account, the    Italian designer proudly displayed the First Lady’s official portrait  —   released by the White House on Monday  —   which featured Trump wearing a DG blazer.  "BEAUTIFUL," Gabbana captioned the photograph, adding the hashtag "#DGWoman. "  #DGWoman BEAUTIFUL ❤❤❤❤❤ #melaniatrump Thank you 🇺🇸❤❤❤ #madeinitaly🇹 A post shared by stefanogabbana (@stefanogabbana) on Apr 4, 2017 at 2:40am PDT,  It wasn’t long before the designer’s critics blasted him for taking pride in seeing his work being worn by the First Lady. "So you have lost a follower, and worst, an admirer," one Instagram user, @_boyafraid_, wrote to the designer. "[I] dont care!! Really," he replied. Gabbana also apparently wrote to one commenter to say, "vai a cagare," or "go to hell" in Italian. This is not the first time the designer has taken on social media users over his show of support for the First Lady. In January, he excitedly shared a photograph of Melania Trump at the president’s New Year’s Eve party in Florida, during which she also wore a Dolce    black cocktail dress, from the company’s "Cruise" collection. "How many stupid and ignorant people r on Instagram!" Gabbana wrote in response to his critics, before telling everyone who didn’t like his posts to unfollow him. Gabbana is one of several designers  —   along with Tommy Hilfiger and Diane von Furstenburg  —   who have said they would have no problem dressing the First Lady, after a number of other marquee names in the fashion world, including Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs, have said they would not design clothing for her.
