Liz Crokin has published an   look at the double standards and political biases of the web’s top social media companies in Observer. [The column covers some of the most prominent free speech controversies on the web over the last year, from the suspension of Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos from Twitter, to the removal of   games from Apple’s online store.  If you take an interest in free speech on the web, it’s well worth a read. You can access the full column here.

Twitter is another culprit. The company has gotten a lot of slack for banning conservatives and Trump supporters such as Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos and, most recently, rapper Azealia Banks after she came out in support of Trump. Twitter has provided vague answers as to why conservative voices have been banned while they’ve allowed other users to call for the killing of cops. Just yesterday, Buzzfeed revealed that the social media giant’s top executive personally protected the President from seeing critical messages last year. "In 2015,   CEO Dick Costolo secretly ordered employees to filter out abusive and hateful replies to President Barack Obama.
