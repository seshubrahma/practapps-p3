Empire creator Lee Daniels sounded a warning at the Human Rights Campaign’s Los Angeles gala on Saturday, telling attendees that Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is going to "take us down. "["I’m not afraid of anything," Daniels said at the LGBT advocacy organization’s annual dinner, according to the Hollywood Reporter. "I’ve dodged bullets  —   real bullets before  —   but now I’m afraid because these motherf —  kers are coming for us, y’all. "  Daniels’s hit Fox television show was an honoree at Saturday night’s event, and the    showrunner accepted the honors along with series stars Jussie Smollett, Gabourey Sidibe, Serayah, Kaitlyn Doubleday, and Ta’Rhonda Jones. According to THR, The Butler director never mentioned Trump by name during his remarks, but it was nonetheless clear to whom he was referring when he urged attendees to "do the right thing" and vote for Hillary Clinton in November. "He’s taking over  —   he’s coming in to take us down, y’all, and this is serious business," he said. "Let’s do the right thing and make sure Clinton is in that f —  ing office and taking care of us. " "I don’t think you realize how much they’re coming for us," Daniels added. "And this is not a joke. I’ve watched everyone make light of what is going on. They are coming for every one of you. White people are not excluded  —   they’re coming for us. " Also at the HRC gala on Saturday, president Chad Griffin called on Hollywood production studios to boycott the state of Georgia if Gov. Nathan Deal does not veto a religious freedom bill that passed the state legislature earlier this week. "It’s " Griffin said of the bill, which Deal must sign or veto by May 3. "It’s an affront on all the values Hollywood prides itself on. And you have the influence and the opportunity to not only defeat this bill, but to send a message that there are consequences to passing dangerous and hateful laws like this. "
