’  ’ ’   Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is backing the CEO of a hot new   finance startup. ’ ’   The Massachusetts senator wrote on her Facebook page on Tuesday   that she agrees with Betterment CEO Jon Stein, who wrote an open   letter to   Donald Trump about keeping the new   fiduciary rule. ’ "   Her post linked to Business Insider’s Monday story about   Betterment’s . " ’   "I agree with CEO Stein," Warren wrote. "Undercutting the rule   would be bad for working families  —   and bad for the many   businesses who have already complied with the new rule." ’ "   Warren has long backed the fiduciary standard, which the   Department of Labor passed earlier this year and which makes it   much harder for conflicted financial advisers to work in their   own interests over their clients’ when managing retirement money. " ’’ ’   Betterment, which provides index funds, bought  of The Wall Street   Journal and The New York Times earlier this week urging Trump to   uphold the rule. ’ ’   The rule is expected to financially benefit firms like Betterment   since advisers would be more likely to put client assets in   passive funds, which are cheaper than actively managed funds. ’ "   While Trump hasn’t indicated his view, one of his advisers, hedge   funder Anthony Scaramucci, has said Trump would repeal it. " ’   Some Wall Street firms, such as Morgan Stanley, are preparing for   the rule to be delayed in its start date, which is planned for   April. ’ ’   In a research note on Monday, UBS wrote that it is "more   confident" in its expectation of a delay. ’ ’   The note also said that Morgan Stanley has "developed alternate   plans" in case it doesn’’t have to comply with the new rule. ’
