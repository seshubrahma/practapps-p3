During an interview with NPR’s "Fresh Air" released on Thursday, New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet stated "we did not have a handle on just how much anxiety there was in the country. And we did not have a handle on just how much that anxiety was going to drive the election. " And "the New   and   too, probably, media powerhouses don’t quite get religion. "  Baquet said, [relevant remarks begin around 28:30] "We wrote a lot of stories about anxiety in America. We even did a series called ‘Anxious America.’ But we did not have a handle on just how much anxiety there was in the country. And we did not have a handle on just how much that anxiety was going to drive the election.   …     I could pull out 25 stories that would prove the point that we wrote about it. But I would be dishonest if I didn’t say those stories didn’t quite add up to a powerful portrait of an angry electorate, an electorate that just wanted change. So, yeah, I think that’s a story we could have done better. By the way, I think even Donald Trump was surprised by the level of that anxiety in the country, everybody was. But, I’m answering for me. " He added, "I want to make sure that we are much more creative about beats out in the country, so that we understand that anger and disconnectedness that people feel. I think I use religion as an example because I was raised Catholic in New Orleans. I think that the New   and   too, probably, media powerhouses don’t quite get religion. We have a fabulous religion writer, but she’s all alone. We don’t get religion. We don’t get the role of religion in people’s lives. And I think we can do much, much better. And I think there are things that we can be more creative about to understand the country. " (  Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
