"  NBC News now reporting a US citizen named Sayeed Farouk believed to be one of the people involved in the shooting.  —   Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) December 3, 2015,  Karen Finney —  spokesman for the Clinton 2016 presidential campaign and former MSNBC host wrote a terse response to this news: Damn, Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta fired back the following response: Better if a guy named Sayeed Farouk was reporting that a guy named Christopher Hayes was the shooter. Breitbart News has reached out to John Podesta via twitter to ask why this would be "better. " Podesta had not responded at press time.
