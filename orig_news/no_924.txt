Representative Steve King, a Republican from Iowa who has a history of making inflammatory statements viewed by many as insensitive or outright racist, was roundly criticized on Sunday for his apparent endorsement of white nationalism. Mr. King made the remark on Twitter when he shared a story by the Voice of Europe website about the   Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who wants to end Muslim immigration and ban the Quran and who has called Moroccan immigrants "scum. " Critics said that Mr. King echoed the principles of white nationalism, the belief that national identity is linked to the white race and its superiority to other races.   white nationalists emerged as a small but vocal group during the candidacy of Donald J. Trump, celebrating his promises to crack down on illegal immigration and ban Muslims from entering the United States, as well as heralding his presidential victory as a chance to preserve white culture. David Duke, the white nationalist and former Ku Klux Klansman who called Mr. Trump "by far the best candidate" during the campaign, celebrated Mr. King’s comments. But many people quickly condemned Mr. King. "You, Congressman, are simply a bigot," one person replied. Another person wrote, "You know that you were ‘somebody else’s baby’ too, right? Or do you not understand how this works?" Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, responded from his personal Twitter account, asking Mr. King to explain himself. Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat who was born in Taiwan, shared a photo of his sons on Twitter. And Miriam Amer, the executive director of the Iowa chapter of the Council on   Relations, called on Republican Party leaders in the state and nationwide to repudiate the message. "This racist tweet crosses the line from   politics to   white supremacist advocacy," she said in a statement. A representative for Mr. King did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. King, who was elected to Congress in 2002, questioned what nonwhites have contributed to civilization at a panel discussion in July about the racial makeup of the Republican Party. "I’d ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you are talking about," he said. "Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?" The month before, he tried to block an effort to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill. In 2013, Mr. King said that for every successful child of undocumented immigrants, there were 100 others who were drug mules with "calves the size of cantaloupes" from hauling marijuana.
