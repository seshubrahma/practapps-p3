The crowd gathered at Cincinnati’s U. S. Bank Arena on Thursday night for   Donald Trump’s "Thank You Tour" event booed their home state governor, whom Trump mentioned by name. ["He said, ‘Congratulations, that was amazing,’" Trump recalled of Kasich, telling the audience that he called and congratulated him after Trump won the election. "We won this state by almost 10 points, which they say is totally unheard of. "  Kasich, who was one of Trump’s competitors during the GOP primary, refused to back the GOP nominee during the general election. "You went out and you pounded the pavement  …    and propelled to victory a grassroots movement the likes of which the world has never seen before," Trump said to his supporters gathered at the event.
