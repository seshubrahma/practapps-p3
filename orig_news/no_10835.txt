" He said a "a lotof  his colleagues in Washington," though, "don’t" trust GOP voters who gave them their power.  He also slammed the "Never Trump" movement in his column: I am a Republican.  And I don’t like Hillary Clinton.  The #NeverTrump people are either hopelessly naïve, ridiculously idealistic or they are   who figure that Hillary is more pliable when it comes to foreign adventurism.  For the   especially, her vote to go to war in Iraq is the real selling point. [  …    ] Trump is not the perfect candidate, but he is the change candidate. Ask yourself this question: Do the American people want change to come to Washington or do they want to embrace the status quo? You think Trump doesn’t have a chance? Think again.

" Bash points out that voters "don’t care about experience" and "detailed policy plans. " Bash notes that Clinton is appealing to the heads of voters while Trump is appealing to their hearts. Gloria Borger rightfully points out on that Clinton is sounding exactly like Jeb Bush (Americans are probably thanking Trump for saving them from a Clinton v. Jeb! snoozefest). 2:36: Flashback: John McCain repeatedly said Americans needed a "steady hand at the tiller" in his campaign against Obama. Voters wanted change instead in 2008. 2:28: Clinton says she is not calling herself the "presumptive nominee" and says she has a lot of empathy for Sanders because against Obama in 2012, she won nine of the last 12 contest but could not close the gap in pledged delegates. She says the gap between her and Sanders is far wider than it was between Obama and her in 2008. 2:27: "Not that I recall," Clinton says when asked if Trump asked her for favors after he donated to her Senate campaign. 2:25: Cooper says Democrats are wondering if Clinton is ready to run a campaign against Trump (he references Trump’s remarks about her  ) and Clinton nervously laughs. She then talks like a robotic politician and says "if Trump wants to go back to the playbook of the 1990s" and "follow in the footsteps of those who have tried to knock me down and take me out of the political arena, I’m more than happy to have him do that. " She says she is ready and says  "this is to me a classic case of a blistering, bullying guy who has knocked out of the way all of the Republicans because they were dumbfounded" and "didn’t know how to deal with him. " Clinton wants voters to get on the "American team" instead of the "red" or "blue" team. 2:21: "I think Elizabeth Warren is really smart," Clinton says, when asked if she agrees with Warren’s Tweet that Trump is running a racist, sexist, and xenophobic. She says anyone who has listened to Trump speak can draw that conclusion. When asked if she thinks Trump is a racist, Clinton simply says, "I’m going to let people judge for themselves, but I have the highest regard for Senator Warren. " 2:20: Clinton slams Trump for demeaning women, degrading people with disabilities, and talking about "keeping Muslims out of the country. " She insists that she is going to keep running her campaign while Trump can run a "bullying" campaign. 2:18: Clinton says Trump needs to put some "meat on the bones" and she says reporters need to ask Trump some tougher questions. Clinton claims she is for "fair and free trade. " She hits Trump for saying that "wages are too high. " 2:17: It’s the economy, stupid. Cooper points out that more Americans trust Trump on the economy than her. "We’ll have to go back and talk about the history," Clinton says of the 1990s. She says Trump can argue about the "peace and prosperity" in the 1990s and she’s going to talk about the future. 2:16: When asked again if she is ready for Trump, she says she has been in the arena for more than 20 years and insists that she isn’t running against Trump and is running her own campaign. "I have a very clear mission in this campaign," she says. 2:15: In an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Hillary Clinton says that Trump’s nomination seemed "pretty clear for some time. " She says it didn’t surprise her at all that Trump got the nomination. When asked if she is ready to run against Trump, she says we can’t take a risk on a "loose cannon" like Trump. Clinton says Trump’s advisers will be "scrambling" and slams Trump for his comments about women and climate change.   2:10: Clinton’s campaign account, The Briefing, is gleefully   those in the "GOP Smart Set" who are vowing not to support Trump in the general election: Much to my deep chagrin ( astonishment ~8 months ago) for the 1st time in my life, I will not support the GOP nominee for president.  —   Guy Benson (@guypbenson) May 3, 2016,  "Every.
