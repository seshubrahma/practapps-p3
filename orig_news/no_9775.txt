Talk radio host and Fox News Channel anchor Sean Hannity declared a New York Times piece about his position on immigration reform and the Gang of Eight was "a   lie" and added that he was "getting pissed off at [GOP presidential candidate Florida Senator] Marco Rubio too" over his performance during the debate and on the trail during his radio show on Monday.  Hannity began by talking about the NYT article. He stated that other talk radio hosts, such as Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, and Laura Ingraham wouldn’t change their principled opinions on any issue. He further said that in 20 years at FNC he had never been told what position to take on a single issue, including immigration. Hannity further stated that after the 2012 election, he did say "out of anger" and "off the cuff" that he had evolved on immigration, if there was border security first, a comment that he regrets. He added that he does not know of anyone who has done more to highlight the issue of illegal immigration than he has. He further declared the NYT piece "categorically nothing but a   lie about me. " And said the piece’s author should have reached out to him first. Later, Hannity said, "I’m getting pissed off at Marco Rubio too.   …     Marco, you’re being inauthentic. You’re not Donald Trump. Stop trying to act like Donald Trump. And stop trying to be something that you’re not. For nine debates, Marco Rubio, I thought presented himself well, and presented his ideas the way he is. And now what’s bugging me about this whole thing is clearly all these establishment guys have sat Marco down and said, ‘Marco, you’ve got to be somebody who you’re not, and you’ve got to go after Donald Trump in a way you never have before. ’" Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett,
