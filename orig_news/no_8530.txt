2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney took a swipe at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump during a GOP dinner on Tuesday night, mocking him for his   wives. ["Donald Trump has had several foreign wives. It turns out that there really are jobs Americans won’t do," Romney reportedly joked at the Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) GOP dinner on Tuesday night.  Two of Trump’s three wives were from other countries. Ivana, Trump’s first wife, was born in Czechoslovakia and Trump’s current wife Melania is from Slovenia. Trump previously took a swipe at Romney, questioning whether or not Romney was Mormon during a campaign rally in Utah. Romney responded to that jab on Tuesday night, mocking, ""He could have just asked my wives. "
