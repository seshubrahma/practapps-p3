.@JoeNBC on Trump speech: Millions in Middle America may have been waiting to hear that for a very long time https:  .  On Friday’s "Morning Joe" on MSNBC, host Joe Scarborough reacted to Donald Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, saying it may have been exactly what millions of middle Americans had been waiting to hear.  "It’s not the speech I would have given. It’s not the speech any of us would have given, it just may be the speech that millions and millions of people have been waiting to hear for a very long time. You have been talking about how people are scared for years. They are scared because their 401K is disappearing. They are scared because they are not doing as well as their parents did. You have been talking about how he delivered a message for an America that is not that scared. I don’t think we are scared because economically we are okay. You know a lot of people in middle America are scared. Doesn’t that message play to them?" Scarborough asked. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
