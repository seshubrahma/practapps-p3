The number of abortions performed at Planned Parenthood, however, has increased, as have its taxpayer funding and profits. "Despite reports that the number of abortions performed in the United States is declining, Planned Parenthood once again reports an increase in the number of human lives ended in their facilities: 328, 348 abortions last year," says Americans United for Life’s president Catherine Glenn Foster. "Additionally, despite their repeated claims that American women rely on them for   health care services, many of their   services have continued to decrease.

"They outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities by an average of 20 to 1 nationwide and are more comprehensive and accessible to the poor. " "Taxpayers would be disentangled from the grisly abortion industry and get a better return on their investment in women’s health," she added.
