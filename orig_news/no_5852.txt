On Tuesday, President Trump signed the repeal of Barack Obama’s gun ban for Social Security recipients. On Thursday, NBC News reported that Trump had signed a repeal of "gun checks for people with mental illness. "[This is Fake News 101, inasmuch as it takes Trump’s commitment to defend the Second Amendment and reports it as something that endangers the American people by allowing mentally ill persons to acquire guns.

House voted to repeal the ban on February 2, the Senate on February 15, and President Trump signed the repeal on February 28. NBC News reported, "Trump signs bill revoking   gun checks for people with mental illnesses. " And they described the ban as a response to Sandy Hook, saying, "President Barack Obama recommended the   regulation in a 2013 memo following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which left 20 first graders and six others dead. " Bloomberg News similarly reported that the ban "was a reaction to school shootings like the 2012 Sandy Hook attack. " Neither NBC News nor Bloomberg asked how an elementary school attack carried out by a    with stolen firearms could be justification for denying elderly Social Security beneficiaries their Second Amendment rights at retail gun stores.
