While speaking at the May 20 NRA Leadership Forum in Louisville, Kentucky, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called on Hillary Clinton to release a list of justices she would consider naming to replace Second Amendment stalwart Antonin Scalia. [Trump pointed out that he has released a list of 11 justices from which he would pick a replacement for Scalia and he urged Clinton to do the same.  On May 10, Huffington Post reported that Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin admitted that Clinton "believes District of Columbia v Heller (2008) was wrongly decided" and she thinks "cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe. " Trump pointed to Clinton’s criticism of this crucial SCOTUS decision and made clear that she "wants to reverse Heller. "  Trump expounded, saying, "Hillary said ‘the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. ’" Trump then stressed that control of the SCOTUS is one of the "biggest reasons" to win in November. He said, "The next president is going to appoint from 3 to 5 judges. " He said that if Clinton gets to appoint judges, she will "abolish the Second Amendment. " He added, "I put forth a list of judges who will protect and defend all of our freedoms, including the Second Amendment. The judges will follow the Constitution. " He said, "Now, I’d like to call for Hillary Clinton to put together a list also. Because I’d like to see who that list [of justices] consists of. And you will see it’s day and night, and her list will not be good for people in this room.
