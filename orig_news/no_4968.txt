" Defending Trump’s education secretary selection, Betsy DeVos Conway said, "Not one child who needs a better education benefited from any of those incendiary questions yesterday. But, of course, Mrs. DeVos held herself with the grace and elegance that we know her to have. " Defending Trump’s pick to head Health and Human Services Rep. Tom Price ( ) Conway said, "He has these investments, apparently, are just a fraction of his overall portfolio and they were done by a broker. " She added, "And by the way, this is another example of just trying to embarrass and humiliate an otherwise eminently qualified nominee. " (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
