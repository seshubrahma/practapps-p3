Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton praised Fox News’s Megyn Kelly as she bashed GOP frontrunner Donald Trump during an appearance on The View Tuesday morning. ["The way he treated Megyn Kelly, who is a superb journalist. Right?" Clinton ridiculed, referencing Trump’s treatment of "so many women. "  "I just don’t understand what he thinks is the role of somebody who is running for president," she added, after saying Trump has attacked Mexicans and Sen. John McCain ( ) who Clinton said is "a friend of mine. " "He started on his very first day saying all Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals, right? And then he moved on to attack people with disabilities. He attacked John McCain," Clinton stated. "And said he wasn’t really a war hero," she added. "He was a POW for years and he was so brave. " The former Secretary of State also referenced Trump’s plan to ban Muslims from entering the country until a proper visa screening process was in place. "So it’s not only women and we who should be concerned, it’s everybody because of the way that he conducts himself," Clinton jabbed. "I don’t think the vast majority of Americans, let’s hope, want to reward that kind of behavior and that sort of really hateful rhetoric. "
