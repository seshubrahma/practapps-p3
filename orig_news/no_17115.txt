Washington (CNN) International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney warned that   Donald Trump’s policies would harm Muslim Americans in the US and across the world. Speaking at a Texas women’s conference this week, she said some of Trump’s ideas would break international human rights laws. "(His comments) that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the US or the fact that there should be   torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed    all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that," she said at the conference, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

"We have to hope for the best," she told the audience, which was made up of more than 7, 000 people. "The   has said that fighting ISIS is actually a priority . .. so it may be that there can be progress, and obviously everyone has to respect the outcome of the democratic process here, and we have to hope for the best." She also told the women in the audience that they have to advocate for each other going forward. "Women’s rights," she said, quoting Clinton, "are human rights. Holding back women is holding back half of every country in the world."
