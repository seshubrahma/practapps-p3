GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, looking toward the general election, criticized Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton and President Obama’s foreign policy during his formal address on Wednesday at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D. C.["We have made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before," Trump said. "Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS. And we’re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won’t even name the enemy!"  "We’ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything," he added. "If President Obama’s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job. " Trump then turned his attention to Clinton. "Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words "radical Islam," even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees," he jabbed. Trump brought up the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya where four Americans died under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s tenure. After Secretary Clinton’s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep! Incredible. Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie. Our Ambassador was murdered and our Secretary of State misled the nation  —   and by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o’clock in the morning. "And now ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil," Trump charged, vowing, "This will change when I am president. " Trump’s full foreign policy speech can be read here.
