Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) is now projected to win the first Republican Caucus state on Super Saturday, according to CNN, as tallies indicate he has scored a landslide victory over businessman Donald Trump, who is now expected to finish in second place. [With 77% reporting, Cruz has obtained over 50 percent of the vote in the Kansas Republican Caucus, according to Politico. The early results have Trump in a comfortable 2nd place with 25 percent of the vote. He is followed by Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. John Kasich with 14 and 9 percent, respectively. In order to obtain delegates, a candidate needs to meet a 10 percent threshold.  Although there were only two polls taken prior to the Kansas Caucus, both showed Trump winning the state, with the real estate mogul defeating Cruz by a margin of six to twelve points. Trump was also a   favorite, according to the prediction website FiveThirtyEight. There were signs that Trump’s Kansas lead was not as secure as pollsters suggested, given his decision to skip the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in order to campaign in The Sunflower State. Before Super Saturday, Cruz trailed Trump in total delegates, 319 to 226.  On Friday, at CPAC, Cruz made the case that he was the lone Republican candidate remaining who can take on and defeat Trump. "The men and women here love liberty. And let me tell you, as dire as things are, people are waking up all over this country, and help is on its way," he told the crowd. Stay with Breitbart News for election results as they come in from the rest of the Super Saturday states, which include Maine, Kentucky, and Louisiana.  Puerto Rico will hold it’s Republican Primary on Sunday. An additional four states (Hawaii, Mississippi, Michigan, Idaho) will be up for grabs on Tuesday, March 8.
