Today, Trump world collided with the real world as president trump hosted German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the white house. The meeting, which was at times awkward, comes after candidate trump repeatedly criticized the chancellor, during the campaign. " After playing a montage of Trump criticizing Merkel, Matthews asked, "Well, the joint press conference between the two was a stark contrast in leadership, and left you wondering who was the adult in the room, not wondering for long.
