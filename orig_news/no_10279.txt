LAFAYETTE, Louisiana  â€”   After a Muslim student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (ULL) claimed that her hijab and wallet were stolen by two   Donald Trump supporters, police announced the claim was fabricated. [The    Middle Eastern student told police that white men shouting racial slurs at her drove up in a truck and struck her multiple times in the back, while also stealing her hijab and wallet.
