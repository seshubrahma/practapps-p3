’  ’ "   White House officials could be inching toward giving back two   Russian diplomatic compounds near New York City and Maryland’s   Eastern Shore,  published Wednesday. " ’   Russian officials were expelled from the the   estate on   Long Island and several buildings in Maryland last year after the   Obama administration leveled new sanctions against Russia for its   interference in the US election. ’ ’   The properties had been under Russian ownership since the Soviet   Union was in power, according to The Post. ’ "   The matter is fraught with potential conflict because US   intelligence officials and congressional lawmakers are deep into   multiple investigations of Russia’s election meddling and the   Trump campaign’s interactions with the Kremlin. " ’   The compounds, which have enjoyed the protection of diplomatic   immunity, have been claimed by the Russians as areas for rest and   recreation for embassy and UN employees. However, officials say   that surveillance reports provide evidence that the compounds   were also used for other   matters. ’ ’’ ’   In December, President Barack Obama gave diplomats at the   compounds 24 hours to leave as part of new sanctions levied   against the Kremlin. Obama also identified 35 diplomats from   Washington and San Francisco as "intelligence operatives" before   giving them   to leave the US. ’ ’   If the Trump administration gives Russia permission to reoccupy   the compounds, it may invoke certain restrictions, including   taking away diplomatic immunity, according to sources cited by   The Post. If that happens, US law enforcement officials would not   be prevented from entering the premises. ’ ’White House officials could be inching toward. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’
