Washington (CNN) The most surprising government agency to lampoon Donald Trump this week? The New York City Parks Department. The department issued a short response after an arts group called Indecline hoisted a   naked Trump statue in Union Square park Thursday. "NYC Parks stands firmly against any unpermitted erection in city parks, no matter how small," said Sam Biederman, a parks spokesman. Indecline, described by The Guardian as an anarchist group, installed nude Trump statues in other cities around the country, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Cleveland and Seattle, the paper reported. A video on Indeclineâ€™s website shows the creators crafting the statue, using paintbrushes and watersprays to mold the clay body and carving "Ginger" into the footboard.  Other aggressive art from the group, according to its site, includes artwork along the   border saying "Rape Trump" and what they claim to be the "largest illegal graffiti piece in the world" along an abandoned runway in California.
