’’ ’Twelve miles from either coast of the Chesapeake Bay sits a small island in danger of disappearing.’ ’Tangier Island, Virginia, is one of the most isolated and extraordinary places in the continental US. But the island sits 4 feet or so above sea level, and a  suggests that little of it will be left 50 years from now.’ ’President Donald Trump, however, disagrees.  that after Trump saw a CNN report about Tangier Island, the president called Mayor James "Ooker" Eskridge to tell him he shouldn’t worry about a rise in sea levels.’ ’"He said, ’’Your island has been there for hundreds of years, and I believe your island will be there for hundreds more,’’" Eskridge told The Daily Times.’ ’But Business Insider photographer Christian Storm visited Tangier Island in 2014, and his photos show how serious the problem has become there.’ ’Storm wrote a previous version of this story.’ "Records indicate that in the   Tangier Island encompassed about 2, 060 acres. It was home to watermelon farms, grazing cows, and a variety of plant life. But since 1850, over 66% of Tangier’s landmass has disappeared underwater." ’"We have a pretty high degree of certainty that things are going to get wetter and wetter," Carlton Hershner Jr. a climate change scientist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science,  in 2013. "Not to be a bearer of bad news for Tangier, but that would suggest that sometime in the next 50 to 100 years the island would basically be underwater. "’ "The island is reachable only by boat  —   it’s an     ferry ride from the coast. That keeps the place mostly closed off from the rest of the world. Some islanders go years without seeing the mainland, getting the supplies from the mail boat that arrives in the harbor every day." ’But being a waterman is becoming increasingly difficult. In an effort to prevent overfishing, Virginia placed a moratorium on new crabbing licenses, and other restrictions have also reduced the length of fishing seasons.’ ’"You don’’t have to worry about traffic jams and murders, child molesters, rapists, and thieves," Laird said. "You can leave your doors open. You don’’t have to lock anything. "’ "Laird and other island natives share a thick accent that’s equal parts Southern twang and Irish brogue. Vowels are extended to multiple syllables, making certain words hard to understand for outsiders." ’"Tangier’’s " Laird said. "It’’s a nice place, and everything’’s reasonable here. "’ ’Today, the Uppards has almost succumbed to the rising water levels, turning into a swampy wetland. Major portions are submerged, reachable only by skiff. A solitary dilapidated mobile trailer on the beach is one of the only signs that humans ever lived there.’ "Laird recalled playing with his friends in the Uppards and hunting ducks there with his father. But despite the stark scene, he doesn’t seem worried." ’"The island ain’’t goin’’ nowhere," Laird said. "They talk about erosion, but it’’s been here forever, and it ain’’t gone nowhere in forever. "’ ’Legend has it that John Crockett  —   still a common surname on the island  —   was the first to inhabit Tangier full time when he arrived with his eight sons in 1686.’ ’The island shuts down every Sunday morning and once denied Hollywood filmmakers permission to shoot the   Kevin Costner movie "Message in a Bottle" there because of the script’’s mentions of swearing, sex, and drinking.’ ’Tangier is dry; booze is unavailable for purchase.’ ’"I’’d like to be able to do this for the rest of my life," said Laird’’s    son, Nick. "It’’s kind of scary to think you might not be able to. "’
