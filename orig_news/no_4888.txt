In past years, the entertainment world has ranked her as one of the "Worst Dressed" at Grammys for skimpy and outlandish outfits. In a recent vlog, Villa shares how she overcomes much of the criticism she has received. She encourages aspiring performing artists to "tell the haters to eff off, because they have no say over your life  —   and as a performing artist, people are going to criticize you ’til you’re black and blue. "
