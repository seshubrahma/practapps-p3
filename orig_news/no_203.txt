(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Last year was Earth’s hottest year on record. And it’s the third consecutive year that we’ve hit new highs, another first in recorded history. Many experts believe temperatures are heading to levels that will pose a profound threat to the natural world and human civilization. Here’s a close look at the data NASA used to build its analysis. And you can see how much warmer your city was last year here. _____ 2. President Obama held the last news conference of his term. He said he was looking forward to spending quiet time with his family, writing and celebrating his 25th anniversary with Michelle. But he also said that he would speak out whenever he felt America’s "core values" were threatened, listing as examples "systematic discrimination being ratified," voting obstacles, "institutional efforts to silence dissent or the press," and efforts to round up and deport children who grew up in the U. S. _____ 3. As for the transition, Donald Trump’s national security team is off to a rocky start, leaving uncertainty on urgent foreign policy issues. His team has barely engaged with the National Security Council below the most senior levels, in part because of a delay in appointing senior staff members and a dearth of people with security clearances. Above, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, Susan Rice, "passed the baton" to Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn at an event in Washington. _____ 4. At Senate hearings for Mr. Trump’s cabinet picks, the nominee for health and human services secretary, Tom Price, insisted that Americans would not suddenly lose their health insurance. Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, above, Mr. Trump’s choice for U. N. ambassador, said she rejected a registry for Muslims. Scott Pruitt, the pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, took a swipe at the Obama administration’s reach, saying his first goal would be a return to "common sense and lawful regulations. " Wilbur Ross, who is up for commerce secretary, acknowledged employing an household worker who might have been undocumented. _____ 5. We’re   a road trip with Trump supporters heading to the inauguration. "He showed that you can stand up for yourself," said a Massachusetts woman driving down with a cardboard cutout of Mr. Trump in the back seat (above). We’ve pulled together a schedule of events to guide you through the week. The women’s protest march takes place on Saturday, but divisions over abortion rights are straining hopes for a united front. _____ 6. Former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara Bush, were both admitted to a Houston hospital, but doctors expect them to return home by the weekend. Mr. Bush, 92, who has pneumonia, was in stable condition after a procedure to clear his airway. Mrs. Bush was being monitored for "fatigue and coughing," a hospital spokesman said. _____ 7. The heads of state, billionaire hedge fund managers and technology executives gathered in the Swiss Alps for the World Economic Forum are ready to fight inequality. Sort of. After populist fury propelled upset votes in Britain and the U. S. many of the talks at the annual forum are focusing on making globalization a more lucrative proposition for the masses. But the rhetoric goes only so far. Redistributing wealth and bolstering workers’ bargaining power are not up for discussion. _____ 8. A big health announcement at the World Economic Forum: A new coalition has raised $500 million to fundamentally change the way pandemics are handled. "We’ll have to make sure we do better than we did against Ebola," said Bill Gates, whose foundation is a main donor. Others are the governments of Japan and Norway, and Britain’s Wellcome Trust. The goal is to develop and stockpile vaccines against three known viral threats and to help create the technology to brew vaccines quickly when needed. _____ 9. Health news on a more individual scale: Contrary to many people’s fears, a new study found that running may actually be good for knees. A   session of running changes the interior of the knee, it suggests, reducing inflammation and lessening levels of a marker of arthritis. _____  10. Finally, a gentle blow against throwaway culture. Repair cafes, which started in Amsterdam and are spreading across the U. S. bring together broken items and volunteers who can fix them. Or at least try. The only guarantee is an interesting experience. "It’s not just about fixing things," one participant said. "It’s about the community, also.
