The man says he was sitting across from the accuser and contacted the Trump campaign because he was incensed by her account  —   which is at odds with what he witnessed. "I have only met this accuser once and frankly cannot imagine why she is seeking to make out that Trump made sexual advances on her. Not only did he not do so (and I was present at all times) but it was she that was the one being flirtatious," Anthony Gilberthorpe said in a note provided to The Post by the Trump campaign. In an exclusive interview arranged by the campaign, Gilberthorpe said he was on the flight  —   in either 1980 or 1981 —   where Jessica Leeds claimed Trump groped her.
