Washington (CNN) Mo Amer, an Arab American   comedian, received an unbelievable gift of comic material when he found himself seated next to Eric Trump on a flight to Scotland on Thursday. Amer, on his way to a leg of a comedy tour, shared a picture he took with Trump on Instagram, and described their conversation.  "Hey guys heading to Scotland to start the U. K. Tour and I am ’randomly’ chosen to sit next to none other than Eric Trump," he wrote. "Good news guys Muslims will not have to check in and get IDs. That’s what I was told. I will be asking him a lot of questions on this trip to Glasgow, Scotland. Sometimes God just sends you the material. #Merica#UKTour #HumanAppeal#ThisisNotAnEndorsement#Trump2016ComedyTour" How these 5 undecided voters made their choices, Amer spoke to Buzzfeed about the experience with Trump    who was reportedly flying to Scotland to check in on the Trump International Golf Links    and said he talked about   Donald Trump’s proposals for a form of government registry for Muslims or immigrants from   countries. "And I said    just FYI I’m not getting that ID s*** done. You gonna really make my people get ID cards and all this? You know we’re not doing this s***," Amer recounted telling Trump. He said that Trump told him, "Come on man. You can’t believe everything you read. Do you really think we’re gonna do that?"
