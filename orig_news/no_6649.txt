On Friday, the Trump administration asked Obama’s   control Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, to resign. [Murthy was confirmed to the position of Surgeon General on December 15, 2014. The   to the confirmation vote on Murthy focused on his "political activism," particularly his positions on gun control.  Opposition from the NRA and other gun rights groups  —   together with Republican opposition  —   actually made it difficult to predict whether Murthy could be confirmed. In fact, he was so   control that Senator Joe Manchin ( ) a red state Democratic proponent of gun control, refused to vote for him. But former Senator Mark Kirk ( ) crossed the aisle and voted yes in Manchin’s place, giving Americans a Surgeon General who viewed gun policy as a "health care issue. " Murthy reiterated his ongoing support for gun control as recently as June 3, 2016, telling STAT: I got into some trouble for saying gun violence is a public health issue. A little bit of trouble. But you know, I was stating what I think is the obvious, and I think most people in the country understand, which is that far too many people die from gun violence. And in my book, every single death from gun violence is a tragedy because it was preventable. It’s unacceptable. Murthy has now been removed and replaced by Rear Adm. Sylvia  .
