Hillary Clinton’s campaign reacted strongly to growing reports casting doubt on the Democratic presidential nominee’s health, calling it part of a "deranged conspiracy" pushed by the Trump campaign. ["Donald Trump is once again peddling deranged conspiracy theories in a desperate attempt to change the subject  —   this time with absurd and debunked claims about Hillary Clinton’s health," the campaign wrote in an email to reporters. "This is hardly the first time Trump and his allies have donned tin foil hats when things weren’t going his way. "  The Clinton campaign issued a statement from Hillary’s doctor, Dr. Lisa Bardack to debunk the fake documents published online under her name. "These documents are false, were not written by me and are not based on any medical facts," Bardack wrote. "To reiterate what I said in my previous statement, Secretary Clinton is in excellent health and fit to serve as President of the United States. " Doubts about Clinton’s health have led to the popular Twitter hashtag #HillarysHealth as photos of the candidate slipping and appearing exhausted have been circulated online to raise questions about her physical ability to serve in the Oval Office. The Drudge Report featured photos of Clinton requiring assistance from aides to ascend the stairs of a location in February and today highlights photos of Clinton’s preference for pillows to prop herself up during interviews.
