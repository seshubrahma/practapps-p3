.@NYTimesDowd: Trump has his wall, but Hillary has a wall around her that gets higher and higher pic. twitter.  Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends," in an appearance to promote her new book "The Year of Voting Dangerously: The Derangement of American Politics," New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd explained that one of the flaws of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is how she handles problems.  According to Dowd, Clinton will stonewall and become defense when "a relatively mundane problem" arises and that it will sometimes ultimately lead to the problem becoming worse. "David Axelrod put it best  —   it’s not about health, it’s about stealth," Dowd said. "And this goes to a problem Hillary Clinton has had. She had it in Arkansas, but it intensified when she got to Washington. I started covering her as first lady in ’92, or even running with Bill in ’92. And it’s a microcosm of her problem, which is when a relatively mundane problem comes up, she stonewalls and it’s defensive. It’s like Trump has his wall, but she has a wall around her that gets higher and higher. And then the press and her foes go into a frenzy because they can’t get the truth and are appearing and disappearing records. And then it snowballs into something that it never needed to be in the first place. " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
