GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is lashing out at Sen. Ted Cruz who he calls "Lyin’ Ted Cruz," after losing to the Texas senator in Wisconsin. ["Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet  —   he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump," the real estate mogul stated.  After past losses, Trump has offered praise. However, in Trump’s statement issued late Tuesday night, he also alleges Cruz participated in illegal activity with his PAC. Trump stated: Donald J. Trump withstood the onslaught of the establishment yet again. Lyin’ Ted Cruz had the Governor of Wisconsin, many conservative talk radio show hosts, and the entire party apparatus behind him. Not only was he propelled by the   Super PAC’s spending countless millions of dollars on false advertising against Mr. Trump, but he was coordinating with his own Super PAC’s (which is illegal) who totally control him. Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet —   he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump. We have total confidence that Mr. Trump will go on to win in New York, where he holds a substantial lead in all the polls, and beyond. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who can secure the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton, or whomever is the Democratic nominee, in order to Make America Great Again.
