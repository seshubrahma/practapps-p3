NEW YORK  —   During a radio interview on Sunday, comic legend and political pundit Jackie Mason compared Bill Clinton’s alleged misdeeds to the controversy surrounding Donald Trump’s statements about Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe who says that Trump called her "Miss Piggy" when she gained weight after being crowned. [Stated Mason:  "What Trump ever did to women is that he called them a name because she gained too much weight so he said she got too fat and he called her a pig. Imagine if the worst thing Bill Clinton ever did was call a girl a name. He called them names after he raped them. " "When he got through with them, Juanita Broaddrick wound up with a cut lip. And he had advised her to please go see a doctor. He was very compassionate about sending them to doctors. But he wasn’t too concerned about beating them up in the first place. He was so busy punching them around that nobody knows if he made love to them or he just wanted to beat them up a little bit. " Mason was speaking during his regular segment on this reporter’s talk radio program, "Aaron Klein Investigative Radio," broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. Mason also sounded off about Hillary Clinton’s alleged treatment of her husband’s purported assault victims: "He was really a violent, insane character. Now his wife, she had a job. Her job was to make sure that these women were never heard about it. Every time somebody threatened to talk about it she immediately went to work on destroying them. First he punched them around. Then it was her job to wipe them out altogether.   …    And she’s calling Trump a person who can’t be trusted because of the way he treats women? This is like somebody who crossed a red light being compared to a murderer. " Jackie Mason will be performing October 9 at the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, NJ.
