Here he is," Schwarzenegger said, before turning the camera over to Kasich, who was sitting beside him. "Thank you Arnold. Love you, man," Kasich replied. Schwarzenegger appeared with Kasich at a rally in Ohio later Sunday. The endorsement comes as Kasich looks to build momentum for his campaign ahead of the Michigan primary on March 8 and the Ohio primary on March 15, where the governor is locked in a close battle with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. Schwarzenegger was announced as Trump’s replacement on NBC’s Celebrity Apprentice in September.
