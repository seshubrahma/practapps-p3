Monday during a rally at Mohegan Sun Arena in Pennsylvania, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump invited a young child to join him on stage.  An aide handed the boy who had   hair and was dressed in a black suit with a red tie and a large "vote" button over to Trump. After getting the boy’s name, Trump said, "Now, he’s supposed to look like Donald Trump, but he’s actually much too  . You are really handsome. " Trump then asked him if he wanted to go back with his parents, or stay with Trump. "Trump," he replied shyly. The crowd then erupted with cheers, and Trump handed the boy back to his parents.
