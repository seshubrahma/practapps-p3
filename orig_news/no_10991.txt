Pollster and strategist Pat Caddell told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam he found   Donald Trump’s selection of South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as his ambassador to the United Nations to be a "surprise," adding that "she is a talented woman   …     and certainly one of the stars of the Republican Party. "["Obviously, Trump is willing to overlook her opposition to him," he added, "and that’s a good sign. "  Caddell, a South Carolina resident, praised Haley’s handling of a number of issues throughout the years. "She made an incredible impression when we had the shooting at the church," said Caddell, in reference to the 2015 Dylann Roof shooting. "She’s quite articulate, she’s smart, and I think she’d do a good job," he concluded. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:
