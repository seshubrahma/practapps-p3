"   "birther" challengers have filed federal lawsuits in Alabama, Utah and Texas and have filed lawsuits in state court in Vermont and Illinois, where a judge today ordered a hearing for March 1, two weeks before the Illinois primary. The filing dates vary with each lawsuit. A challenge had been filed in the state election division of Indiana that was denied today. 7:15: Plurality = majority for Trump?

His critics have argued for months he’ll never be able to grow that      coalition by clashing with Pope Francis, attacking former President George W. Bush and skipping debates like he did once in Iowa. His negatives, they say, are just too high. But a new   poll finds registered Republicans and   voters put Trump at the top of the   GOP field when it comes to which candidate fits best with their stand on the issues. They give Trump the best marks for competence and decisiveness. Far more Republicans than not say they’d vote for Trump in the general election, and 86 percent of Republican voters think he can win in November —   giving him a 15 percentage point advantage over his nearest rival. If the number of Republican candidates shrinks as expected after Saturday’s primary in South Carolina, Tuesday’s Nevada caucuses and on Super Tuesday on March 1, the Trump coalition, it would appear, has plenty of room to grow. 6:40: Nevada: . @davidplouffe: "We got mamboed by the Clinton campaign in Clark Co. 8 years ago.

Even if Sanders loses narrowly to Clinton, it seems like Sanders is ready to spin that he is a candidate who doesn’t just appeal to   whites. When asked about Sanders’s brothers comments about Bill Clinton, Devine says "Bernie loves his brother very much" but his brother Larry, who has lived in England, does not speak for Bernie or the campaign. Devine says Bernie disagrees with his brother’s characterization of Bill Clinton as a rapist. 5:20: Clinton pollster Joel Benenson says Sanders is "not being straight" with voters re: his wanting to primary Obama. Tough for Clinton to argue that someone is "not being straight" with voters after all of her calculations. But Clinton’s line of attack against Sanders re: his lack of support for Obama seems to be resonating with black voters in South Carolina. 4:55: Trump the builder: 4:45: Strong argument from Cruz: Winning in defense of the cross, Ten Commandments, #2A  Pledge of Allegiance#ChooseCruz: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 19, 2016,  4:35: Trump threatens to only use Samsung if Apple doesn’t unlock the terrorists’s iPhones: I use both iPhone  Samsung.

I have no doubt he means well. Latinos matter in this election, and he knows it. But my question for Bernie is, where the heck was he for the last 25 years? Where was he on immigration reform? On indefinite detentions? On vigilante justice against undocumented workers? He was nowhere. That’s where. 3:28: Trump: Boycott Apple until they allow access to the San Bernardino terrorists’s phones. He accuses Apple CEO Tim Cook of "looking to do a big number" to "show how liberal he is. " 3:25: The dating site for Sanders supporters is getting so many visitors that it keeps crashing.  3:20: Trump praises police officers, saying a few bad apples prevent the public from seeing the 99% of the good work that they do.

Mitchell actually tried to compare a robotic Hillary Clinton moment at Thursday’s debate to her husband’s interaction with an   questioner at at 1992 town hall event that may have arguably won Bill Clinton the election. She tried to make the case that Hillary came across as empathetic as her husband. There is no comparison. Yesterday, Hillary addressed a woman who wanted the   immigration bar on her husband lifter in order to DODGE a question about her opposition to driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants in New York in 2007 (her exchange with the late Tim Russert on that issue arguably started her demise eight years ago). What in the world is Mitchell thinking? Here’s Hillary’s exchange last night.

Hillary Clinton’s campaign had planned for any number of troubles on her path toward the Democratic nomination money was never supposed to be among them. [  …    ]Clinton’s rainmakers have grown anxious. She began the year with $10 million more in the bank than Sanders, but that cushion is disappearing fast. "The pond is getting fished out. Everyone is sending invitations to the same group of people. And those people have already given as much as they are allowed to give," warned a Clinton loyalist in Los Angeles who has raised tens of thousands of dollars for the campaign. "There are only so many people in Hollywood with $2, 700 to give. Eventually you burn through them," said another political insider, an advisor to wealthy donors in Los Angeles. Both spoke on condition of anonymity to comment on the fraught issue of cash. 2:15: As a Chicago judge gets ready to hear the " " case against Cruz, Indiana’s election commission rejected a citizenship challenge against Rubio: BREAKING: Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio stays on Indiana ballot, commission rules https:  .   —   Greg Weaver (@BizWeaver) February 19, 2016,  2:07: After his Super PAC bought radio ads in Nevada yesterday, Kasich will apparently skip the Nevada caucuses: John Kasich to skip Nevada Caucus, focus on states voting in March https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) February 19, 2016,  2:03  —   Tampa Bay Times says superdelegate Alan Grayson may switch his support from Clinton to Sanders.

Since then, Hillary Clinton has picked up endorsements from 87 more superdelegates to the Democratic National Convention, dwarfing Sanders’ gain from the New Hampshire primary, according to a new Associated Press survey. Sanders has added just 11 superdelegate endorsements. If these party insiders continue to back Clinton overwhelmingly  —   and they can change their minds  —   Sanders would have to win the remaining primaries by a landslide just to catch up. He would have to roll up big margins because every Democratic contest awards delegates in proportion to the vote, so even the loser can get some.    —   7:35 am  —   The NBC   has a rare spot of good news for Hillary Clinton.

Trump 28% Cruz 23% Rubio 15% Bush 13% Kasich 9% Carson 9%. In light of the bizarre   outlier poll that showed Trump losing his national lead to Cruz, some people might look skeptically at this SC poll. The RCP average shows Trump’s lead dropping 5 points over the last few days but he is still maintaining a 14 point lead. Obviously, the only   poll will be the voting tomorrow. There is little doubt, though, that the race appears to be tightening.
