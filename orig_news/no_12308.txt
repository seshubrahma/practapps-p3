Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump repeated his challenge to presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on pledging not to sign the   Partnership (TPP) trade deal while speaking about trade in New Hampshire Thursday. ["We have to withdraw" from the TPP, Trump told his supporters on Thursday, adding, "and we should seek a guarantee from Hillary Clinton she won’t sign it. "  Trump had previously challenged Clinton on the TPP during his speech Tuesday addressing trade in Pennsylvania. Trump wants the media to press Clinton to "unconditionally rule out its passage in any form. " Clinton reportedly helped draft the TPP. Trump’s campaign estimates the trade deficit with countries who are participating in the TPP has already cost 7, 400 jobs in the state of New Hampshire. "While she continues to hide from the media on the challenge, Mr. Trump has no such issue and will continue to proudly fight for American workers over global special interests," stated a press release from the Trump campaign Thursday afternoon.
