Sunday on ABC’s "This Week," while discussing presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s change agenda, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile declared that Trump doesn’t look like "change. "  Brazile said, "You keep talking about change. Change for what? Change to hurt people, to hurt minorities, to hurt women, to insult people with disabilities. I mean, that’s why Donald Trump is not the perfect change messenger. He doesn’t even look like change   …     If Trump is such a great businessman and manager why does picking a vice president which is one of the big tests of a presidential candidate, why does it devolve into a clown show.
