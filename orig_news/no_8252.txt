Under a   jumbotron blaring the words "women should vote," rapper Jay Z kicked off a   music performance for Hillary Clinton in Cleveland Friday night. [A relentless torrent of   and   permeated from the stage as Jay Z belted out the misogynistic lyrics to his 2009 song "Dirt Off Your Shoulder. "  "If you feelin’ like a pimp n*gga, go and brush your shoulders off," Jay Z sang. "Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off. N*gga is crazy baby, don’t forget that boy told you. Get that dirt off your shoulders.

The pair danced while Jay Z sang lyrics to his 2013 hit "Holy Grail. " "Now I got tattoos on my body. Psycho bitches in my lobby. I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi. Can’t even take my daughter for a walk," Jay Z sang. "If this is all you had to deal with. N*gga, deal with, this shit ain’t work. This light work, camera snappin’ my eyes hurt. N*ggas dying back where I was birthed. Fuck Your iris and the IRS. Get the hell up off your high horse. You got the shit that n*ggas die for, dry yours. Why you mad? Take the good with the bad. Or throw the baby out with that bath water. " "You still alive, still that n*gga. N*gga, you survived, you still gettin’ bigger. N*gga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa. Illest n*gga alive Michael Jackson’s ‘Thriller,’" he sang. Jay Z  Queen Bey.

"I actually like Jay Z, but you know the language last night," Trump said Saturday as the crowd cringed. "Can you imagine if I said that?" "So he used every word in the book last night. He used language last night that was so bad  —   and then Hillary said, ‘I don’t like Trump’s lewd language,’" the Republican nominee added as the audience booed.  The rap superstar also performed newer music, including the song "I Got the Keys. " "N*ggas always asking me the key. Til you own your own you can’t be free," he sang. "Til you’re on your own you can’t be me. How we still slaves in 2016?" Clinton joined the music moguls on stage at Friday’s event and praised Jay Z’s music, Breitbart News reported. "I thank Jay for addressing in his music some of our biggest challenges in the country: poverty, racism, the urgent need for criminal justice reform," Clinton said.
