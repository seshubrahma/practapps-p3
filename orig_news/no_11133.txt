.@tedcruz: These idiots rioting in the streets are the same people who demanded   Trump accept the results of the election pic. twitter.  Thursday on Fox News Channel’s "Fox  Friends," Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) slammed those protesting against the results of last week’s election of Donald Trump.  Cruz pointed out the hypocrisy of the protesters, noting they had an expectation of Trump accepting the results of the election, whereas they have seemingly failed to do so. "We have seen hypocrisy on rank display from the left," Cruz said. "All of the folks who jumped on their high horse and were lecturing   Trump, ‘You’ve got to accept the results of the election,’ look  —   these are now the idiots who are protesting in the street, laying their bodies down in front of cars and disrupting traffic. " "We had an election," he continued. "The people spoke. Democracy is a powerful, powerful way of choosing. And you know, I think across this country  —   I think this is across the line of Republican, of Democrats, of independents, of Libertarians  —   I think Americans are excited about the opportunity to have an administration that protects our rights, that brings back jobs.
