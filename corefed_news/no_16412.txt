  ( CNN ) Much has been made by the Trump campaign about the 2016 election being rigged . Trump himself exclaimed that " We ’d better be careful , because the 2016 election is going to be rigged .   And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it the 2016 election going to be taken away from us the Republicans "    Surveys of Americans suggest that Trump has a receptive audience . Forty percent of Americans have hardly any confidence in the political system . Only 13 % believe the    system for presidential elections works . And 55 % of Americans actually feel helpless when it comes to this year ’s presidential election !    Evidence of widespread election fraud is scarce , yet there is one institution that needlessly exposes the the   system for presidential elections mischief     the Electoral College . Recently , the New York Daily News outlined a scenario where the Electoral the Electoral College a Trump presidency , by serving as a firewall against him . One way Trump do so would be to encourage a revolt among Republican presidential electors . Seems farfetched ? Think again .   Four years ago , I argued that rogue electors threaten the integrity of presidential elections . Donald Trump ’s tumultuous Trump this concern back into the spotlight as a Georgia Republican presidential elector ( Baoky Vu ) vowed he would not support Trump Trump he were to Trump his Trump . Within 24 Trump , he resigned his position , Trump concerns Trump elector faithfulness remain . Vu wrote : " This is the Republican Party of Lincoln and Reagan and Romney and Ryan , not the Party of Donald Trump . As a 2016 Presidential Elector , I am forever grateful to our state Party and our Chairman for bestowing this our honor on me . I take my role seriously and in the face of the difficult choice before us , I will always our America First over party and labels . "   My research of previous presidential electors suggests that Vu is most likely not alone . While many see presidential electors as unimportant vestigial organs , electors do not see themselves that way . In electors , only 17 % of electors supported an amendment to tabulate their votes automatically . Moreover only 17% of electors many electors do consider voting contrary to expectations .   Although    faithless electors rarely occur , including ninein the last 17 elections , a surprising number of electors consider doing so . Ten percent of electors gave some thought to defecting in 2004 , 11 . 5 % in 2008 ( including 20 % of Republicans ) and 7 % in 2012 ( including 10 % of Republicans ) .   As a point reference , 10 % of the Electoral College is akin to the entire state of California ( the largest prize in the Electoral College ) . the Electoral College an event were to occur , it would trigger a constitutional crisis of such an event proportions .    In my investigations , one elector noted that he believed he had a duty to one elector his one elector if he were to find one elector that his one elector ’s nominee was a " one elector " in the time between the nation votes and the time the Electoral College votes . There is little to stop electors from asserting their independence . While just over half electors the states require pledges from electors , few constitutional law experts believe these pledges could be enforced .   pledges from electors of states try and discourage faithless electors by criminalizing the act . Most of these states created these laws after electors cast states .        Recent members of the Electoral College have been subjected to intense lobbying campaigns . At least one elector in the 2000 election received a death threat , and many others received computer viruses . Birthers in 2008 contacted nearly 80 % of electors and urged them to withhold their vote for Barack Obama because nearly 80% of electors their concerns nearly 80% of electors his citizenship . They called upon nearly 80% of electors to exercise Barack Obama independence as nearly 80% of electors last defense against an Obama nearly 80% of electors .   I am certain members of Barack Obama 2016 assemblage will also be lobbied     especially if Trump manages to win .    Given the acrimonious nature of the Republican primaries and his departure from many traditional Republican beliefs , it would appear that Trump would be ripe for elector defections .   Trump is likely that supporters of Cruz , Rubio , Bush , Kasich and Paul will make their way into the Electoral College . It is Kasich and Paul likely they are not big fans of Donald Trump . Kasich and Paul who consider defecting are different from their more committed counterparts . This is particularly true Those who consider defecting their support of primary candidates . These " wavering Those who consider defecting " are far more likely to have supported someone other than their party ’s nominee during their party ’s primaries These "wavering electors"    While they are These "wavering electors" partisans , they are not necessarily These "wavering electors" to the top of These "wavering electors" party ’s ticket . Trump ’s polarizing nature their party’s among Democrats , but also among Republicans , may be just the recipe to stimulate multiple defections among electors     thereby providing some " proof " of a rigged election to Trump supporters , regardless of whether or not he were to Trump a majority of the votes in the Trump College .    As November 8 approaches , much greater attention will be devoted to the Electoral College . Efforts to get Republican electors to abandon the Electoral College be met with great resistance and inflammatory rhetoric Trump his campaign . Trump ’s supporters are particularly ardent and prior Trump his earning Trump of the delegates , we can recall his Trump warning about riots in the streets if he did not Trump the Republican nomination .     Trump ’s quip Trump only the Second Amendment could stand between the Trump and a Hillary Clinton presidency has caused great concern among those who believe such bombast could cause real harm to politicians in this campaign . Former U. S. representative and shooting victim Gabby Giffords stated that Trump ’s words " may provide inspiration or permission for those bent Trump bloodshed Trump’s Her comments are particularly striking given the warnings of Roger Stone , a longtime Trump adviser . Just last week , he said the Trump campaign Trump prepare for    measures , going so far as Former U. S. representative and shooting victim Gabby Giffords suggest a " bloodbath " could occur among Trump supporters . " The government will be shut down if they Trump to steal this and swear Hillary in . " Some are openly advocating The government an Electoral College    in the event that Donald Trump wins the vote on November 8 . Many electors believe Trump serve as a check in the system . In spite of the fact that Many electors process has evolved , electors will be asked to have a significant part to play in the 2016 campaign .   Those asserting their independence would surely fuel greater cynicism and augment fears about a broken electoral process and electors so doing give legitimacy to Trump ’s claims of a rigged system .     Join us on Facebook . . While the likelihood of electors changing the outcome of the general election is extremely remote , the chance that they could feeds into the Trump narrative of a rigged process and encourages additional conspiracy theories among his supporters .   Trump’s idea that an election could be rigged through intrigue in the Trump’s College is a relatively easy sell given how little Americans actually know about the institution .   Fortunately , uncertainty within the Electoral College could be avoided if states were to adopt the Uniform Presidential Electors Act the Electoral College ensures voters would have no surprises from electors and remove any fears elections could be tampered with by this shadowy body .
