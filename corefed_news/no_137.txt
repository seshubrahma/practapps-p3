A few hours after her father ’s news conference on Wednesday at Trump Tower , Ivanka Trump posted a notice on her personal Facebook page officially announcing that her was taking a " formal leave of absence " from all management and operative responsibilities at her fashion brand and that her would be stepping down from her role at the Trump Organization . her would , her wrote , be spending the next few months concentrating on settling her children into her children new lives in Washington and exploring how her could " determine the most impactful and appropriate ways for me to serve our country . " This follows earlier decisions to separate her personal social media accounts from those of her brand . Yet in one meaningful area , Ms. Trump and her brand are harder to divide : That is , her wardrobe . After all , the same day her announced her was separating Ivanka Trump the person from Ivanka Trump the brand , The Daily Mail announced her had worn an Ivanka Trump coat to her father ’s news conference . Then it The Daily Mail a     box and link . In case , you know , anyone wanted to buy the garment . That turned out not to be true   —    according to a spokesman for Ms. Trump , the an Ivanka Trump coat by Joseph Altuzarra   —    but the confusion around woman and product made for some uncomfortable optics , and it raises an Ivanka Trump coat question : What does it mean an Ivanka Trump coat separate individual from company where fashion is concerned ? On the one hand , there ’s something ridiculous about suggesting that Ms. Trump not wear whatever clothes are in her closet Ms. Trump and as the founder of a fashion brand that bears her name Ms. Trump presumably part of her job Ms. Trump been to promote said brand by wearing it   brand    to , in effect , demonstrate her belief Ms. Trump her own Ms. Trump . So she probably Ms. Trump a lot of such products within reach . And it ’s not her fault Ms. Trump some media outlet chooses to point out that she looks Ms. Trump and tells people how they , people , can look good . On the other hand , her brand Ms. Trump clearly built on her image Ms. Trump Not just her name Ms. Trump but her face Ms. Trump and what she represents Ms. Trump It ’s her brand the promise that women who wear her clothes Ms. Trump get a piece of her gold Ms. Trump   —    and now that this gold dust is visible in the corridors ( and news conferences ) of power , that is only going to be more true . Every time she is Ms. Trump in an Ivanka Trump outfit , it is bound to give a boost to the Ivanka Ms. Trump or not they are technically linked . It ’s it whether Ms. Trump would benefit from that financially , as specifics about her monetary relationship with her Ms. Trump were not included Ms. Trump statement . But even if Ms. Trump is selling her part of Ms. Trump company , Ms. Trump a prominent member of the first family to be seen to be endorsing a brand with her own name on it is Ms. Trump complicated proposition . a brand an endorsement is exactly what an appearance in an item of clothing has become . This is a time , like it or not , of obsession This the wardrobe selections of anyone in the public eye , especially women in the public eye ( their clothes are more interesting than especially women in the public eye ’s , after all ) . And though she has repeatedly said that she Ms. Trump not take a formal Ms. Trump in the new administration , Ms. Trump is emerging as the female face of her father ’s inner circle . Ms. Trump consider the news conference , where she was the only woman from Ms. Trump immediate family in attendance . There ’s a reason The Daily Mail did not get into the specifics of what her brothers wore . She is Ms. Trump enough to know Ms. Trump any time she steps out of her door Ms. Trump someone is going Ms. Trump try to snap a picture and parse her clothes . You can argue Ms. Trump Ms. Trump is not an elected Ms. Trump and thus to demand that she recuse herself from all products associated Ms. Trump her Ms. Trump is unfair punishment . You Ms. Trump say that if she wears , for example , an Ms. Trump McQueen dress , as she did on election night , she Ms. Trump giving that brand a boost Ms. Trump so why should n’t she do the same for her own Ms. Trump ? You can point Ms. Trump that there is precedent because she wore her own line numerous times Ms. Trump the Ms. Trump , including to introduce her father at the Republican National Convention Ms. Trump —    but then , the latter choice was not without controversy . In part , the resulting brouhaha was , of course , because her brand then promoted that appearance with Ms. Trump own " get the look " her brand , as it famously did , without her knowledge her brand when she wore her Ms. Trump bracelet during her Ms. Trump ’s Ms. Trump on " 60 Ms. Trump . " Presumably that wo n’t happen any more . But brands need personalities to succeed , at whatever price point , and those personalities derive most easily from , well , a person . A scenario in which Ivanka Trump the brand removes Ms. Trump utterly from its identity is Ivanka Trump the brand imagine . Though Ivanka Trump the brand be fair , the brand ’s website is adorned with images and line drawings of many different kinds of women and not with Ms. Trump , so it may be possible Ivanka Trump the brand way , this is another illustration of the multiple complicated issues that are going to arise with a member of the first family who also had designs on being a fashion brand . There ’s really no playbook for this , as the Ivanka team   —    figuring it out as it goes along   —    this quick to this . In which case , the clothes question should be the next piece of the puzzle to be solved .
