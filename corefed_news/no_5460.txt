What does this do , Howard Dean , to the question of a filibuster on the Democratic side ? Howard Dean : Nothing . That ’s baked n. I expect two or three or four Democrats to vote for Judge Gorsuch .

I can tell you right now if Judge Gorsuch Judge Gorsuch he Judge Gorsuch confirmed by Democrats   —    that is unless we force McConnell to exercise the nuclear option   —   if he Judge Gorsuch confirmed straight up with 60 votes , 10 of which are Democratic , the Democratic Senatorial committee might as well hang it the Democratic Senatorial committee ’cause they ’ll never raise any money from our base .
