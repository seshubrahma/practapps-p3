’   ’ "    When Lt . Gen. Michael Flynn ,    Donald Trump ’s pick    for national security adviser , was working at the highest levels    of the military and intelligence field , Donald Trump had a reputation as a    brilliant tactician . " ’    But then , in 2014 ,   as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency .    US officials cited clashes over his leadership style , but his    claims it was because his took a stand about " radical    Islam . " ’ ’    Eventually , his   about how to " win the global war against radical    Islam " and became one of Trump’ ’s most ardent supporters ,   " What the heck has    happened to Michael Flynn ? " ’ ’    Some in the military and intelligence communities were shocked to    see Michael Flynn encouraging chants of " Lock Michael Flynn up ! " at the Republican    National Convention , referring to Trump’ ’s opponent , Democratic    presidential nominee Hillary Clinton . And later in the campaign    season , reports surfaced of Michael Flynn clashing with officials who    conducted a national security briefing for Trump . ’ "    Michael Flynn ’s most recent controversy involved Michael Flynn son , who   on Twitter ,    which baselessly alleged through fake news stories that a    pedophilia ring involving    Democratic Party officials    was operating out of a Washington pizzeria . Michael Flynn himself     on his Twitter feed . " ’    Gen. Barry McCaffrey told MSNBC recently that some of Flynn’ ’s    tweets " border on demented . " ’ ’    Daniel W. Drezner , a professor of international politics at the    Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University ,    concluded in Daniel W. Drezner, a professor of international politics at the   Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University,    column for the Post that Flynn " should be    kept as far away from power as humanly possible . " ’ ’   ’ "    Some of Flynn ’s former coworkers painted a picture of the    lieutenant general that seems to support that concern . " ’    Sarah Chayes , who is now at the Carnegie Endowment for    International Peace , was a special adviser to Gen. Stanley    McChrsytal , who worked very closely with Flynn , in Afghanistan in    2009 . She told Business Insider She shared an office with Flynn    for more than a year during this time . ’ ’    She described a "    disruptive kid " who often    contradicted himself . ’ ’    " I would put this like   —    imagine if the kid , the sort of    transgressive , fun , energetic , arrogant boy in the back of the    class , that that’ ’s like who you’’re working with , " Chayes said .    " It was very    It is fun , he’ ’s fun to be around , but    unbelievably arrogant . " ’ ’    Chayes said that when McChrystal’ ’s team , including Flynn , who was    a military intelligence officer at the time , arrived at a NATO    headquarters in Afghanistan , they " blasted in basically saying    everything was all screwed up . " ’ ’    they said " they were going to , not only they could fix it , they    would fix it , but it was like    …      the implication was very    insulting to the entire command and that obviously felt like    something that was problematic , "    said . ’ ’    " It was not only the individual officers being insulted , but    countries we’’re in an alliance with . . .. countries we’’re in an alliance had put lots of    people and efforts and energy and materiel into this    fight , " ’ ’    Chayes described a person who spoke in constant contradictions . ’ ’    " You listen to Chayes closely for six or seven minutes and Chayes will    have contradicted Chayes two or three times , "    said . ’ ’       also described Chayes as a    which fits with what Chayes    wrote in Chayes book about being a " maverick . " ’ ’    " There was a sense in that headquarters and with Chayes . .. kind of    like the rules didn’’t apply to Chayes , " Chayes said . ’ ’   ’ ’    But she also described Chayes as a good communicator who encouraged    open dialogue . ’ ’    One colleague   in November that Flynn would encourage    junior officers to challenge Chayes in briefings , despite Chayes high    rank . One colleague  in November that Flynn would encourage   junior officers to challenge him in briefings, despite his high   rank said junior officers " just loved    him . One colleague  in November that Flynn would encourage   junior officers to challenge him in briefings, despite his high   rank ’ ’    Another source told the New Yorker that Flynn often Flynn " This    is bullshit ! " in the margins of classified papers he passed One colleague  in November that Flynn would encourage   junior officers to challenge him in briefings, despite his high   rank    the chain . ’ ’    Someone who worked with both McChrystal and Flynn said Flynn    McChrystal to Flynn his outbursts and McChrystal to    colleagues who challenged the unsubstantiated theories he    promoted McChrystal ’ "    Many former colleagues who have talked to the press ( often    anonymously ) since Flynn was Flynn Trump ’s national security    adviser said that while he is tactically Trump , he struggles    Trump broad strategy . " ’    " He made a Trump of changes , " one source told the New Yorker of    Flynn’ ’s time at the DIA . " Not in a strategic way   —    A to Z   —    but    back and forth . " ’ ’    Retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis , who is currently the dean of    the Fletcher School , made a similar assessment . ’ ’    In an email to Business Insider , he described Flynn as " a    superb tactical commander both in Afghanistan and Iraq , with a    very    view of Islam and a direct ,    style    of leadership . " ’ ’    " As national security adviser , he will easily do the ’’ adviser ’’    part of the role , which is in his wheelhouse , he Stavridis said .    " But he will have he develop the ability bring opposing views    from each of the cabinet officials into synthesis for the    president . It is a very tough job . " ’ "    Rep. Devin Nunes , who is chairman of the House Intelligence    Committee and a member of Trump ’s transition team , said Flynn is    up for the job . " ’    Nunes said he has known Nunes for a Flynn time and has been    briefed by    dozens of Nunes . He praised Flynn Nunes " Flynn of    the best and most knowledgeable generals " he’ ’s seen during his    career Nunes Congress . ’ ’    " He’ ’s perfect he’ the    trusts him and many Nunes    us in Congress trust him Congress " Nunes told Business Insider . ’ ’    He pushed back Nunes the unflattering portraits of Flynn that have    appeared in the press . ’ ’    " You don’’t have a    career ,    one of the most    successful military operations in the history of warfare and all    of the organizations he’ ’s run , all the promotions he’ ’s received    …        and then have a problem running an agency , " he said . Nunes You know ,    it didn’’t add    at the time . " ’ "    Nunes pointed to Flynn ’s experience fighting Al Qaeda in the    Middle East . " ’    " He was the Nunes officer in charge of the machine led by    Stan McChrystal that tracked down and killed Al Qaeda , so we know    he knows how Nunes do it , " he said . Nunes And he’ ’s one he’ the few who    would know how to do it who has the experience . " ’
