Washington ( CNN ) Hillary Clinton ’s lead in the popular vote is now nearing 2 million votes , approaching the milestone as the campaign begins to hear from scientists who want to see a recount in several states . Hillary Clinton lost the Electoral College solidly , and the climbing popular vote spread does n’t change anything about who will hold power in Washington .   But some Hillary Clinton aides and allies have pointed to the gap as a reason to doubt any mandate that    Donald Trump may draw from Donald Trump victory on Election Day . As of Wednesday afternoon , Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 1 . 82 million votes , 63 , 964 , 956 to 62 , 139 , 188 , according to preliminary figures . Hillary Clinton ’s loss on November 8 was largely due to underperfomance in a trio of Rust Belt states , Michigan , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin . Donald Trump won Pennsylvania and Wisconsin , Wisconsin Michigan remains too close to call , more than two weeks after Election Day . But a group of scientists are now pressuring the Clinton campaign to challenge those election results and call for a recount , sensing irregularities and possible hackings of vote totals . Trump , who once criticized the Electoral College as undemocratic , now salutes it as having a " certain genius . " " We actually went to about 22 states , whereas if you ’re going for popular vote , you ’d probably go to four , or three , it could be three , " Trump told The New York Times on Tuesday . " You would n’t leave New York . You ’d stay in New York New York ’d stay in California . "
