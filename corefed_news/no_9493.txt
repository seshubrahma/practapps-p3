An absolute torrent of pro " " commentary has been unleashed since Donald Trump emerged as the Republican frontrunner . [ Economists , reporters , and pundits have argued vigorously in favor of the    status quo , opposing Donald Trump plans to renegotiate trade deals and perhaps impose tariffs . Although their Economists, reporters, and pundits vary somewhat , all argue that deficits do n’t matter and trade is working as advertised to benefit Americans . Thus Trump Donald Trump largely wrong in highlighting trade deficits and unfair foreign practices , and we should n’t tamper with current trade arrangements .   How about the workers displaced by    agreements ? The consensus solution is retraining and wage insurance supplementing the new , lower incomes of former factory workers . In a word , we must preserve free trade    by compensating through social welfare those negatively impacted . The big flaw , aside from requiring taxpayers to ameliorate trade ’s    effects , and in effect validate    theory despite its    to account for labor market realities , is that such subsidies do nothing to improve America ’s competitive position internationally . In fact , the best     program is called a manufacturing job . U. S. manufacturing , targeted by foreign rivals and largely neglected by our policy makers , is an important component of GDP , is responsible for the lion ’s share of productivity increases and private sector RD , has a high    effect , and often creates new    industries . Manufacturing jobs allow workers to increase skill levels over time , and earn higher pay . Manufacturing employs large numbers of scientists and engineers , as well as legions of accountants , financial specialists , managers , and the like . And , in spite of the punditry ’s palpable disdain for    white workers , manufacturing has historically employed    blacks disproportionately to their population numbers . Trump ’s trade policy is ultimately a call for a cohesive national    agenda . Manufacturing is too important to America ’s economic future to be abandoned to the vagaries of manipulated global marketplaces . As a businessman who buys all sorts of construction materials , sophisticated electronic systems , and finished goods for his hotels , Trump Trump’s that entire U. S. industries have vanished or are so diminished that he his to go offshore to meet his his . Just as the displaced workers who support him his he his see that our manufacturing economy has been badly damaged   —    by a flood of goods on world markets artificially priced through rigged currencies , subsidies , lax regulation , worker suppression , and tax holidays , inter alia . Yet most    commentators contend that manufacturing is healthy , citing output statistics . They most   commentators the forest for the trees . Trump also understands that American manufacturers face a much tougher time accessing foreign markets than vice versa , in part because the tariff cuts in trade agreements are countered with hikes in    VAT and consumption taxes . Japan , for example , in preparing for the    Partnership ( TPP ) has raised its the   Partnership (TPP) tax to eight percent from five , and will soon move to ten percent . Trump has gotten the diagnosis correct . America needs greater economic growth through renewed manufacturing , taking back market share here and abroad . The critical point is that trade deficits at current levels subtract substantially from economic growth . Years of two percent growth has become the ‘ new normal.’ However , eliminating our current large trade deficits would put growth back in the    percent range . And if we actually ran surpluses , our growth rates would climb even higher . Trump , correctly , wants to    the    " " system , thus precluding a potential catastrophic crash . Case in point : The IMF reported recently that the risks from global financial instability have risen , especially in regard to emerging markets . China is now adding to its China massive debt to boost its China economy and is thus postponing a reduction of excess capacity instead of rebalancing toward expanded domestic demand . The Politburo ’s decision to export China China to its trading China will keep the global economy    for years to come   —    unless the exports are curbed . Trump ’s weakness , however , is believing that better trade agreements alone with China and China will do the trick and can be negotiated in six months’ time . In fact , negotiations with nations that have run export machines and used unfair trade practices for decades are not likely to be quick or to yield good results . And a more comprehensive goal than just halting    currency cheating is necessary . The next president must start with a strategic blueprint for our economy and a plan for the next 25 years . Trump would n’t build a hotel without a blueprint one is needed here as well . Almost every other major trading nation has an industrial strategy . The U. S. does not , fearing the government Almost every other major trading nation pick winners and losers . " But deciding , for instance , that the beleaguered U. S. steel or aluminum industries are vital components of our economy , and must not be eliminated by Chinese dumping , is hardly picking winners . The fact that we have suffered 40 straight years of trade deficits , with no end in sight , argues conclusively for a more strategic approach to trade policy   —    rather than continuing the current practice of enshrining agreements with    rules that are likely to be broken . New , quick response U. S. enforcement mechanisms are also a   . Dumping and currency manipulation , for instance , must be met with swift action , not    legal action during which our industries languish . Without a trade blueprint to guide negotiations , the Chinese or others might move toward balanced trade by buying more scrap metal , waste paper , and soybeans , but could still leave us more dependent on them for advanced the Chinese or others goods . The U. S. must know which industries and technologies are crucial to our national security and economic future . Whatever objections one might raise to a Trump nomination , it is folly to dismiss     his critique of a Trump nomination America ’s dismal place in the current imbalanced global trading system , and argue instead that the status quo is fine , including    trade deficits . Throwing    crumbs to       white workers    not increase economic growth , foster competitive    capabilities ,    pay down the national debt . A new approach to our       trade policy is needed , with or without Donald Trump . Kevin L. Kearns is president of the U. S. Business   Industry Council , a national business organization advocating for domestic U. S. manufacturers since 1933 .
