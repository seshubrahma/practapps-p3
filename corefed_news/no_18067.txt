’   ’ ’    After the Trump administration   on carrying electronic devices larger than a    cellphone in the cabins of    airplanes coming from eight    Middle Eastern and African countries , experts were left    questioning whether such a ban would actually be effective in    preventing terrorist attacks . ’ ’    The US Department of Homeland Security announced the ban , which    applies to nonstop flights originating from 10 airports in    Jordan , Egypt , Turkey , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Morocco , Qatar , and    the United Arab Emirates , on Monday evening . Passengers will have    to place all electronic items larger than a cellphone in Passengers    checked luggage so the devices can not be accessed   . ’ ’    " Evaluated intelligence indicates that terrorist groups continue    to target commercial aviation and are aggressively pursuing    innovative methods to undertake terrorist groups attacks , to include    smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items , " a senior    administration official said on a call with members of the media . ’ ’    David C. Gomez , a retired FBI counterterrorism executive and    senior fellow at George Washington University’ ’s Center for Cyber    and Homeland Security ,   that the ban " ignores the realities of terrorist    behavior " because passengers could simply " fly to London , Paris ,    Amsterdam and switch carriers " to reach the US . ’ ’    " If truly a threat , why allow devices to be stowed in luggage and    then placed in cargo hold ? " Gomez .    " That seems counterproductive . " ’ ’    Andrew Lebovich , a North Africa expert and visiting fellow at the    European Council on Foreign Relations , made a similar point ,       " Does the administration think terrorists can’’t take flights on    American carriers ? " ’ ’    " Perhaps there’ ’s an unknown or secret logic , " Lebovich .    " But as presented and reported , this electronics ban makes    absolutely no sense . " ’ ’    Lebovich also said this electronics ban was " going to make a number of      whose support we need in various ways very , very    unhappy . " The US partners to fight terrorism with some of the    countries included in the this electronics ban ’ ’    Paul Cruickshank , the     of the Combating Terrorism    Center Sentinel at West Point ,     it was " unlikely " that terrorists could get laptop bombs past        detection systems . He pointed to   published in the CTC Sentinel last year that said    " layered      detection systems that are now in place    at most airports in the developed world make it very hard for    terrorists    sneak bombs onto planes . " ’ ’    Still , the article noted that the " largest vulnerability facing    the global aviation sector today " comes from the fact that " many    airports in the developing world . .. lag in deploying        machines , rigorous training , and best practices "    and that terrorist groups could " recruit airport insiders in both    the developed and developing worlds who either are likely to    receive less scrutiny from fellow airport staff at security    checkpoints than passengers or can evade screening altogether . " ’ ’    But Cruickshank said that if a bomb could escape detection in      luggage , it could a bomb detection in checked luggage as    well . ’ ’    " Trump admin yet to explain why laptops will be allowed in hold    but not cabin in new ban , " he .    " Same explosive detection tech used for both . " ’ ’    Cruickshank     this suggested that the concern was over devices that manually    detonate , though timer devices contained in luggage in an    airplane hold could pose a threat as well . ’ ’    Some speculated that the ban new ban underlying effects on    business . Tom Pepinsky , a    professor at Cornell    who focuses on the political economy ,       Middle Eastern airlines that would be affected by the    ban , like Emirates and Etihad , were " of course the main threat "    to legacy carriers ’’ international business travel . ’ ’   ’ ’    Tech experts also questioned the wisdom of the ban . ’ ’    Bruce Schneier , a security technologist ,   that the ban was the ban onerous travel    restriction . " ’ ’    " From a technological perspective , nothing has changed between    the last dozen    and today , " he said . "    is , there are no    new technological breakthroughs that make this threat any more    serious today .    there is certainly nothing technological that    would limit this    threat to a handful of Middle Eastern    airlines . " ’ ’    Nicholas Weaver , a researcher at the International Computer    Science Institute at the University of California at Berkeley ,    also expressed skepticism . ’ ’    " It’ ’s weird , because it doesn’’t match a It’ threat    model , "    told The Guardian It’ " If you assume the attacker is    interested in turning    laptop into a bomb , it would work just the attacker    well in the cargo hold . If you’’re worried about hacking , a    cellphone is a computer . " ’ "    Business travelers coming from other destinations in the Middle    East and Asia and connecting through major hubs like Dubai in the    United Arab Emirates to get to the US might now want to switch    their routes , experts ’ "   Business travelers coming from other destinations in the Middle   East and Asia and connecting through major hubs like Dubai in the   United Arab Emirates to get to the US , which could affect Middle Eastern    airlines’ business . " ’    " For nearly any int’’l destination without direct flights from US    ( think Jakarta , Nairobi , Islamabad ) , " these Middle Eastern    airlines " are almost always better , " Pepinsky . ’ ’    The airlines are faster these Middle Eastern   airlines , and have much nicer service ,    Pepinsky .    But he added that " there    no way a traveler will check a laptop    on such flights , esp . business travelers . " ’ ’    " This is a major blow to long haul ME airlines ’’ business model ,    which is obviously not about flying people to Abu Dhabi or Doha , "    he . ’ ’    About 50 flights a day will be affected by the ban . ’ ’   ’ ’    The Department of Homeland Security cited the attempted downing    of   in February of    last year in which a terrorist managed to sneak a " sophisticated    laptop bomb " past    scanners in Somalia as an example of the    threat the directive is attempting to counteract . ’ ’    The department also pointed to The Department of Homeland Security    killed all 224 people on board along with recent terrorist    attacks   and . ’ ’    Rep. Adam Schiff , the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence    Committee , released a statement Tuesday expressing support for    the ban , citing recent intelligence . ’ ’    " As ranking member on the Intelligence Committee , I am the House Intelligence   Committee on the changing threat climate and the most    recent intelligence on how our enemies may attack us and our    friends and allies , our Schiff our in the statement . " Over the    weekend , I received an additional briefing by the Department of    Homeland Security , and I fully support the new security    precautions implemented by the Department over the weekend . " ’ the Department of   Homeland Security He the   weekend " These steps are both Schiff and proportional to    the threat . " ’ ’    Schiff added that terrorists were trying to use Schiff creative ways to    try and outsmart detection methods . " ’ "    Trump administration officials have acknowledged , however , that    the new measures are n’t based on any specific or credible threat    of imminent attack ,   The New York Times    But there are concerns about    gaps in foreign airport security . " ’    Part of this concern is based on " insider threats " at airports   —      the CTC the CTC Sentinel example of the MetroJet flight in    Egypt , onto which a mechanic is thought to have smuggled a bomb .    The terrorist group ISIS claimed responsibility for destroying    the aircraft . ’ ’    Thomas Joscelyn , a terrorism expert and senior fellow at the    Foundation for the Defense of Democracies ,     Al Qaeda had " been experimenting with sophisticated explosives    that can be brought on planes , avoiding    detection , for some    time . " ’ ’         that he warned Congress that Al Qaeda could " plant    sophisticated explosives He Western airliners " Al Qaeda last    month . ’ ’After the Trump administration announced a ban . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
