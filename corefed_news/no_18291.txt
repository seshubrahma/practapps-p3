’   ’ ’    President Donald Trump   that he’’d be    " honored " to talk to Kim Jong Un , and while it’ ’s   to meet with one of the world’ ’s most brutal    dictators , it’ may provide an important glance into . ’ ’    Several top Trump administration officials have stressed an    " " approach to North Korea , at    different times emphasizing military action , collaboration with    China for harsher sanctions ,     China    missile program , and now , finally , direct talks . ’ "    While Trump has been   and has n’t shied away from the prospect of    conflict , Trump has at times had nice things to say about the    country ’s leader . " ’    " He’ ’s 27 years old , He’ father dies , took over a regime , so say    what you want , but that’ ’s not easy , especially at that age , "    Trump said in an . ’ ’    In an interview with CBS’ ’s " Face the Nation , " Trump called Kim a    " . " ’ "    During the campaign , Trump said Trump ’d talk to Kim   —    and that there    was a 10 % to 20 % chance Trump ’d talk Kim out of Trump nuclear program ,    . " ’    But Yun Sun , a senior associate at the Stimson Center , told    Business Insider that direct talks with Kim would have been    " impossible " under President Barack Obama , who took office as    North Korea had burned US diplomats by pulling out of the      talks at the critical moment when it was set to    denuclearize . ’ ’    " By telling the North Korean leader that he’ ’s a ’’ smart cookie ’’    and he’’d be ’’ honored ’’ to talk to them , I sense a difference in    the US policy goals coming to North Korea , " Sun said . " President    Trump’ ’s goal and "President   Trump’ agenda are quite strictly limited to the    denuclearization of North Korea . " ’ "    Sun Sun with another agenda : addressing North North Korea    abysmal    record and    dynastic nature of its    leadership       Sun , Trump Sun be speaking highly of Kim    to signal his goal is not Kim    change , only neutralizing the    nuclear threat . " ’   ’ ’    Sun characterized Trump’ Sun apparent course as " pretty classic      . " ’ ’    But according to Jenny Town , the assistant director of the      Institute and a managing editor at   there may not be much to gain    by reading into Trump’ ’s statements , which have been all over the    place . In addition to the " smart cookie " comment , " he’ ’s also    called Kim a madman , imbalanced , and irrational , " Town said . ’ Town    Town noted that Trump said he’’d talk to Kim only " under Kim right    circumstances . " If those circumstances were understood to mean    North Korea’ ’s denuclearization , they would still be " above the    threshold of what we can expect North Korea to do unilaterally , "    Town said . Town Town However , if the US could assure the Kim regime that it did n’t    want the Kim regime remove it from power , it    be a little    willing to    abandon its nuclear ambitions    "       " I think , across the board , this administration attaches less    importance to ideological issues    authoritarianism , " Sun    said . ’ ’    With China , where religious persecution is   and enemies of the Communist    Party are   Trump has embraced its    leader , Xi Trump , often pointing to the strength of their    relationship as a its   leader, Xi Jinping in the North Korean conflict . ’ ’   ’ "    None of the reports from Trump ’s summit with Xi Trump has    mentioned a discussion of human    , which might have been a      issue with past administrations . " ’    " Trump has a pragmatic approach to Trump    issues that    he sees as most important , Trump Sun said . " In the current state , he    sees that the North Trump issue is the most important . " ’ ’    This pragmatism has appeared elsewhere in Trump’ ’s foreign policy .    Trump authorized a cruise missile strike Trump the government    of Syrian President Bashar Assad to punish its use of chemical    weapons Trump while his administration simultaneously admitted Assad’ ’s Syrian President Bashar Assad leadership was a " . " ’ "    But even Xi , North Korea ’s treaty ally , has n’t found Kim    honorable enough to meet with even once since Kim took power in    2011 Kim    " ’   ’ "    Although Trump said it would be an honor to meet with Kim , the    US ’s Kim    of the North Korean regime most likely has n’t    changed , Sun said . Trump may merely be signaling a Trump , tactical    willingness to engage with a country that could eventually pose a    nuclear threat . " "    Meanwhile , the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier lurks off North    Korea ’s coast , and Chinese and South Korean diplomats are meeting    to discuss tightening sanctions on North Korea . " "    According to Sun , these actions are likely Sun pressure the Kim    regime while showing that there ’s a realistic ,        on the road to a nuclear confrontation .
