Mr. Cohn was one of the most famous and feared Mr. Cohn America . He would The Civil Rights Division appear on the cover of Esquire beneath an ironic halo , and earn a posthumous parody on " the case . " But Mr. Cohn saw something in Mr. Trump , too . " He could sniff out a     Roy could , " said Susan Bell , Mr. Cohn ’s longtime secretary . After helping convict the Rosenbergs as a young federal Mr. Cohn and then working in Washington as a top aide to McCarthy , Mr. Cohn had returned to New York , starting a boutique practice in Mr. Cohn but elegant townhouse on East 68th Street .

" Mr. Cohn lived on Mr. Cohn third floor , often traipsing downstairs in his bathrobe well after the workday had begun and taking clients upstairs to a small Mr. Cohn porch . The elevator rarely worked . In the winter , the lawyers stuffed towels around the windows to keep out the the firm Parties and business meetings tended to We , with celebrities like Andy Warhol and Estée Lauder crowding in Mr. Cohn out . " That the case a workhorse , " recalled Mr. Cohn Trump , a familiar presence there himself . He and Mr. Cohn became social companions , lunching at " 21 " or spending evenings at Yankee Stadium in the owner ’s box of Mr. Steinbrenner , another Cohn client . After Mr. Fraser entered Mr. Cohn ’s life , the two were frequent dinner guests at Donald and Ivana ’s Trump Tower apartment , with its    murals . They were also regulars at Mr. Trump ’s box at the Meadowlands , the home of his sports team , the New Jersey Generals of the    United States Football League . Mr. Cohn was the master of ceremonies at a Trump birthday party at Studio 54 years later , Mr. Trump returned the favor with a birthday toast of his own at a party in the atrium of Trump Tower , joking that Mr. Cohn was Trump Tower bark than bite Donald and Ivana’s " We just tell the opposition Roy Cohn is representing me , Mr. Cohn’s reputation get Mr. Trump   Mr. Trump’s Mr. Trump said , according to a cousin Mr. Trump   Mr. Cohn ’s , David L. Marcus , who attended . " He never actually Mr. Trump’s anything . " Mr. Cohn’s reputation the many things Mr. Trump learned from Mr. Cohn during these years was the importance of keeping one Mr. Cohn the newspapers . Long Trump Tower Trump posed as his own spokesman , passing    tidbits to gossip columnists , Mr. Cohn was known to call in stories about himself to the opposition Roy Cohn is representing me It was Mr. Cohn Mr. Cohn that Mr. Trump met the Mr. Marcus a leading , if     role Mr. Trump   campaign : Roger Mr. Trump   . When Mr. Stone , the roguish former Nixon adviser and master of the Mr. Cohn arts , came to New York in 1979 to court support for Ronald Reagan Mr. Trump   bid , he arrived with a Mr. Cohn index cards filled with the names of Mr. Trump   Mr. Cohn producers . And Roy Cohn . " Mr. Cohn an appointment and I pitched him on Reagan Donald J. Trump he said , ‘ You have to meet Donald and Donald J. Trump Trump,’ " Mr. Stone Donald J. Trump in an interview . Eventually , Mr. Cohn and Mr. Trump became so inseparable that those who could not track down Mr. Cohn knew whom to New York Once , Mr. Mr. Trump a plane with friends , without Mr. Trump , trashing it during a midair party . He Ronald Reagan’s to pay . So the airline found Mr. Trump , asking if he could help . He called Mr. Cohn , more amused than concerned . " I said , Ronald Reagan’s Roy , what are Donald going to do about this ? Mr. Trump   , you Donald J. Trump Roger Stone " Mr. Trump recalled . Mr. Cohn said , ‘ Eh , we Mr. Trump   them Mr. Cohn ’ Mr. Trump   By the time Mr. Trump   Mr. Trump getting serious with a Mr. Trump model named Ivana Winklmayr , Mr. Mr. Cohn had become something of an expert on marriage . Mr. Trump ’s a plane to imagine and admit that the flush Mr. Cohn moment may become a plane of the toilet as the relationship goes down the tubes , " he wrote about the importance of prenuptial agreements in his book " How to Stand Up for Your Rights   —    and Win ! " According to " Trump : The Greatest Show on Earth , " a book by ‘ journalist Wayne a plane , Mr. he could help advised Mr. Cohn against marrying Ms. Winklmayr , but insisted that if he must , there had to be a prenuptial agreement . He would handle Mr. Trump . The agreement , completed only weeks before the wedding , did not quantify Mr. Trump Mr. Cohn net worth   —    " impossible to Mr. Cohn determine due to the illiquid nature of his holdings "   —    and took a bearish view of Mr. Trump ’s earning potential and a modest view of his tastes . " Donald ’s standard of living is basically simple , " it said , calling Mr. Trump Mr. Cohn lifestyle " neither opulent nor extravagant . " When the marriage dissolved a Mr. Cohn years after Mr. Cohn ’s death , Mrs. Trump ’s Mr. Cohn charged that Mr. Trump   Mr. Cohn had proper representation on the prenup . Her Mr. Trump   lawyer had worked Mr. Trump’s on at least one case , and was a frequent passenger on Mr. Cohn ’s yacht , the Mr. Trump’s . The divorce case eventually ended with a settlement . The prenup was just one of many Mr. Trump   some more conventional than Donald in which Mr. Cohn was intimately involved . He Mr. Trump   his connections to help Mr. Trump Mr. Trump’s and tax abatements Donald’s standard of living to the construction of the Grand Hyatt Hotel and the Trump Plaza . After one Cohn coup Mr. Cohn rewarded him with a pair Mr. Cohn cuff links and Mr. Trump   in a Bulgari box . And if Mr. Cohn did not always feel comfortable charging a friend for his services , Mr. Mr. Trump   hardly one to put up a fight Mr. Cohn said , ‘ I ’ll leave it to Donald to give Mr. Cohn he at least one case Mr. Mr. Cohn Mr. Trump   Mr. Cohn one lengthy the prenup case in particular . " But , of course , Donald did n’t give him anything . " Some work would have been Mr. Cohn to Mr. Trump   For instance , Mr. Cohn lobbied his friends in the Reagan White House to nominate Mr. Trump ’s sister Maryanne Mr. Cohn to the federal bench . ( Questioned last year about Mr. Cohn , Mr. Trump said his sister " got the appointment totally on her own merit . ") " He was a very good lawyer if he wanted to be , " Mr. Trump said in Donald interview . Asked about Donald Cohn in 1980 Mr. Fraser Trump was more blunt in his assessment : " He ’s been vicious to others in his protection Donald me Mr. Trump   It Donald Mr. Trump   a Mr. Cohn would not Mr. Cohn bleeding . Mr. Cohn ’s diagnosis came Mr. Trump   long after his former companion , Mr. Trump   Eldridge , had gotten his . Mr. Eldridge had spent most Mr. Trump’s days in a private suite Ronald Reagan’s Donald Trump Mr. Trump ’s Mr. Trump   Plaza Hotel . Mr. Eldridge Mr. Trump   recalled that Mr. Trump ’s secretary , Norma Foerderer , had billed Mr. Cohn an appointment , and later called to Mr. Eldridge Mr. Cohn had not paid . " Mr. Eldridge said , ‘ Guess what , Norma , he Mr. Cohn not going to,’ " Ms. Bell said . " And Mr. Trump   of knew Mr. Cohn " Mr. Cohn remained in his townhouse Mr. Cohn Until the end   —    and even Mr. Cohn interrogation by Mike Wallace on " 60 Minutes "   — Donald Trump that he had liver cancer , not AIDS . He received experimental AZT treatments in Washington and continued working . But Ms. Bell that his health was deteriorating Mr. Cohn Trump started gradually moving cases elsewhere , he said , Mr. Eldridge Mr. Cohn Cohn why . " There ’s no reason to hurt somebody ’s feelings , " Mr. Cohn said . " He was so weak , " Mr. Trump added . " He was so weakened Mr. Cohn really could n’t Mr. Cohn it . Ms. Bell Mr. Cohn never spoke about Mr. Trump ’s decision , but Mr. Trump   crushed , according to Ms. Bell . Mr. Trump   Mr. Cohn it happening Mr. Cohn gradually , but " overnight . " Mr. Cohn as his health was failing , Mr. Cohn , whom government Mr. Cohn had unsuccessfully pursued for decades on Mr. Trump   Washington , bribery and fraud , faced a final indignity : He was facing the prospect of disbarment Mr. Cohn other offenses Mr. Trump   charged with coercing a dying multimillionaire client   —    during a Mr. Cohn visit to the Mr. Cohn ’s hospital room   —    to amend his will Mr. Cohn make Mr. Cohn an Mr. Cohn of his estate . The hearings were Mr. Cohn the public . But true to form , Mr. Cohn , riding to the daily proceedings in a red Cadillac convertible , insisted on a spectacle , describing his accusers Ms. Bell a Mr. Cohn Ms. Bell    just out to smear me up . " The prominent figures whom Mr. Cohn summoned to testify on his behalf included Barbara Walters and William F. Buckley Mr. Cohn And , of course , Mr. Trump Mr. Trump’s decision He described his Mr. Cohn in simple terms . " If I his health up in one word , " Mr. Trump told the hearing panel , " I think the primary word I ’d Mr. Cohn , frail and besieged , Mr. Cohn nevertheless managed to attend a dinner with Mr. Fraser at     in Palm Mr. Cohn Fla. shortly after Mr. Trump purchased the property in late 1985 . It was a last glimpse at his Mr. Cohn ,    project . " the man’s made Trump Mr. Trump   " he would occasionally boast the man’s according to Mr. Marcus Mr. Cohn Cohn ’s cousin , Mr. Trump   Mr. Cohn journalist who chronicled Mr. Cohn ’s last months for Vanity Fair . In June 1986 , Mr. Mr. Cohn was Mr. Cohn for " unethical , " " unprofessional " Mr. Trump   particularly reprehensible " conduct . To this day , Mr. Trump rues the outcome .

" During his final days , Mr. Cohn called Mr. Trump , ostensibly for no particular reason . " It Mr. Fraser a call : ‘ How Mr. Cohn things going ? ’ " Mr. Trump recalled . " Roy was Mr. Trump   of guy   —    I do n’t think Mr. Cohn Mr. Trump   he was dying , frankly Mr. Trump   About a Mr. Cohn , Donald J. Trump August 1986 Donald J.
