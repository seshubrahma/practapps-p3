Election data compiled by Breitbart News on the Democratic Party ’s primaries and caucuses in 2016 and 2008 show that turnout in is down significantly , nearly 20 percent , from the last contested election . [ Election data compiled by Breitbart News on the Democratic Party’s primaries and caucuses in 2016 and 2008 also show that the about 4 . 5 million fewer people have voted in the Democratic presidential contest this year versus 2008 .   This this year contest is a    race between Democratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . Clinton is former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton a former U. S. Senator from New York , a position she held former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton eight years as first lady . Hillary Clinton former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president in 2008 , which makes this data all the more interesting : It ’s essentially a comparison up against her previous failed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , when she was the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Democratic presidential candidate until then Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois blew past her late in former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton game taking the lead before winning the nomination and then eventually the presidency . Back in 2008 , as Obama battled Clinton Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois a whopping 23 , 715 , 866 people voted in primaries and caucuses nationwide in the states that have already voted this cycle . Fast forward to the next time there ’s a Democratic primary for president , this year ( since Obama was the Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois president seeking reelection the primaries in 2012 were largely perfunctory ) and turnout has dropped off significantly . Just 19 , 155 , 825 people have voted thus far in primaries and caucuses this cycle , a decrease of 4 , 560 , 041 voters or 19 . 23 percent . The steep drop off is so significant on the Democratic side that the vast majority of states saw drops in voter participation in Democratic primaries and caucuses . The following contests saw less voters participate on the Democratic side in the primaries and caucuses than 2008 ’s contests : Alabama , Arkansas , Florida , Georgia , Louisiana , Massachusetts , Mississippi , Missouri , New Hampshire , New York , North Carolina , Ohio , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia , Utah , Wisconsin , Vermont , American Samoa , Hawaii , Iowa , Minnesota , Nebraska , Nevada , Washington state , and Wyoming . Only a handful of states have seen increases in participation on the Democratic side , including Arizona , Michigan , Alaska , Colorado , Idaho , Kansas and Maine . With the exception of Arizona , Sanders Arizona —   and Clinton lost —   each of those contests . That means the likely Democratic nominee , Hillary Clinton , Clinton increased Democratic primary votes in one of the states she won this cycle Clinton compared with 2008 ’s primary turnout . Every other state she has won this Clinton has seen less turnout from last   . The Democratic race started with slightly more fanfare than it ’s turned out The Democratic race have , with former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley criticizing " royal " families in American politics while photos of him playing his guitar former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley emerged former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley Even so , O’Malley failed to materialize former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley a serious contender , and he dropped out early former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley the process . Former Sens . Jim Webb of Virginia and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island —   who was also the governor of that state , and Rhode Island was a Republican —   also ran and both dropped out as well . And since Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) declined to run against Clinton , as did Vice President Joe Biden , that essentially paved the way for Clinton to easily march to Clinton Democratic nomination . The only competition she ’s faced this cycle Clinton come from Sanders , who again is a proud socialist —   a term that just a few years ago was as dirty a word as communist or fascist —   with radically liberal ideas . While Sanders has run what even Donald Trump ally Roger Stone calls a magnificent race —   strategically deploying assets in key places , focusing on delegate accumulation and beating Clinton where it counts —   he a magnificent race never a serious Sanders to the Democratic Party ’s queen . So , as the seriousness of the race dropped off quickly a magnificent race did voter participation . For instance , in Texas , 50 . 06 percent less Democrats participated in 2016 than did in 2008 . Back then , 2 , 874 , 986 Democrats voted in the primary —   whereas this cycle only 1 , 435 , 895 Democrats voted . That ’s a drop off of 1 , 439 , 091 . Mississippi saw a drop off of 206 , 988 votes , or 47 . 68 percent , while Wisconsin saw a collapse of 111 , 715 votes or 10 . 03 percent and Virginia bottomed out with 20 . 40 percent , or 201 , 162 , less votes this time in 2016 than last time in the Democratic primaries in 2008 . Other big states like Iowa saw 68 , 355 less votes , a crash of 28 . 5 percent , in the caucuses and like New Hampshire ’s primaries saw 12 . 01 percent , or 34 , 538 , less voters this time in 2016 than last    in 2008 .   Breitbart News compiled this data analysis from information purchased from Dave Leip ’s Atlas of U. S. Presidential Elections . That data , available at USElectionAtlas . org , is widely used by academics and media organizations including the New York Times , the Economist , Harvard , Columbia , Cornell , and many more reputable organizations . There are five caucus states where Democrats do n’t report to authorities , or to the media , official turnout numbers —   where they only report state delegate numbers five caucus states where Democrats don’t report to authorities are selected based off of the number of    who show up . So , in those cases —   Iowa , Kansas , Nevada , and Washington State —   Breitbart News relied on the best information available for turnout of the general public to caucuses , whether it be press releases or statements from those state Democratic parties to media , or media estimates . Also , in the case of Idaho , there was a primary and a caucus in the state in 2008 , while just a caucus in 2016 —   though the 2008 primary was entirely    and inconsequential .
