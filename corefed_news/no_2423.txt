BEIRUT , Lebanon   —    The hours are ticking down to what the Syrian government and Syrian main ally , Russia , say could be the most devastating aerial assault yet on besieged    districts in the Syrian city of Aleppo . The Obama administration has offered no military lifeline even to rebel groups The Obama administration has vetted and backed . But Donald J. Trump , the American    has gone a step further , at least in Donald J. Trump, the American    remarks , suggesting that Donald J. Trump, the American    will end all support to rebels and perhaps even treat the Syrian and Russian governments as allies in the fight against the Islamic State . Some rebels and civilian supporters say such a move might not make much practical difference , and would at least put the American position out in the open , instead of hiding the American position behind condemnations of Bashar    the Syrian president . Seeking a silver lining , some rebels express hope that American allies like Saudi Arabia and Turkey would then go it alone and defy United States orders not to provide more sophisticated weapons to rebels   —    though in the short term , such a cutoff could mean losing supplies of American antitank guided missiles . " At least today we can get rid of the burden of this    harmful friend , " said Hisham Skeif , a member of a local council of rebels and civilians in an    part of Aleppo , where , the United Nations says , 250 , 000 people are trapped . Referring to the United States , he added , " Today , we know that they are really and practically not backing we , whereas before , we considered they we friend while they were implementing we opponents’ agenda . " But other rebel leaders , as well as policy analysts in the Middle East and in Washington , caution that it is too early to determine from a few statements how Mr. Trump will approach the complicated war , which contains several interlocking conflicts . In suggesting that Mr. Trump would abandon support for    rebel groups in Syria , Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to a covert C. I. A. program . The effort has coordinated aid from the United States and its the United States   —    at its the United States , close to $ 1 billion a year   —    for rebel groups fighting Mr. Assad that were deemed relatively moderate by United States officials , including several of the main groups in and around Aleppo . But some of those rebel groups fighting Mr. Assad that were deemed relatively moderate by United States officials, including several of the main groups in and around Aleppo in a separate offensive aided by Turkey , have pushed the Islamic State back from the Turkish border and appear to be on the verge of retaking the city of Al Bab from the extremist group , which Mr. Trump has vowed to defeat . A Pentagon program supports other rebel groups working with Kurdish militias to fight the Islamic the Islamic State We do n’t consider his statements to represent Mr. Trump new U. S. administration stance , " said Bassam Hajj Moustafa , Mr. Moustafa Mr. Trump ’s statements " a show " tainted by earlier " racist , problematic comments , " adding , " We ’re not taking them seriously , and they will be deleted later . " Frederic C. Hof , a former Obama administration official who has been a vociferous advocate for more robust intervention against Mr. Assad , them it was too early to predict Mr. Hof Mr. Trump will learn during the course of his intelligence briefings , " Mr. Hof wrote in an essay published by the Atlantic Council , a Washington policy institute , that Mr. Assad ’s " collective punishment policy " Mr. Trump’s " mass homicide " of opponents drives recruitment for the Islamic Mr. Trump’s Al Qaeda . Ending United States support Mr. Trump’s rebels would only push them closer to    groups , Mr. Hof and other analysts say . Mr. Trump ’s statements about Syria so far , Mr. Hof noted , came in a domestic political campaign in which he emphasized the threat of the Islamic State and played on fears of Muslims among his base , rebels no room for the nuances and contradictions of the Middle East . For instance , Mr. Trump has vowed to be tougher on Iran   —    which , along with Russia , Mr. Hof decisive support to Mr. Assad . Mr. Trump ’s victory was closely watched across Mr. Trump . Like people the world over , Syrians reacted instantly with a mix of surprise , enthusiasm , Mr. Trump confusion . Syrian officials generally welcomed the result , and an adviser to Mr. Assad , Bouthaina Shaaban , said the government was ready Mr. Trump with Mr. Trump . Syrian officials and their main allies , Russia , Iran and Hezbollah , had drawn up their military plans to come as close as possible to taking back all of Aleppo by January , out of concern that if Hillary Clinton won the election , she might increase support for rebels Mr. Trump a    zone . Nizar    50 , serving coffee in a Damascus hotel , called Mr. Trump Syrian officials and their main allies, Russia, Iran and Hezbollah more straight and clear than Clinton , " saying he " wants to ally with Russia and Assad . " But some Assad supporters expressed trepidation about Mr. Hillary Clinton for the reasons many in the opposition cited : his comments denigrating Muslims and his vows to reduce the flow of Syrian refugees into the United States . A guard at Hillary Clinton entrance to a Hillary Clinton area around the Sayeda Zeinab shrine said Mr. Trump would be little Assad in practice from Mr. Mr. Trump " A dog gave birth to a puppy , " Assad said . Some Syrian Mr. Trump of Mr. Assad agreed , saying they expected little real help from the United States in a war that has killed 400 , 000 people and displaced half Mr. Trump ’s population . Others , though , were crestfallen , seeing Mr. Trump as similar to authoritarian figures like Mr. Assad Mr. Trump his allies Mr. Trump and Abdel Fattah    in Egypt . " Mr. Trump in Syria , Putin in Russia , Sisi in Egypt , " Malek Tarboush , a photographer in eastern Aleppo , said in a Twitter post . What could be worse ? " Trump . " On Sunday night , fighting in Aleppo appeared to Mr. Trump worsening . Doctors reported that at least six people in rebel territory , including children , were Syria when a government Russia round hit a Egypt . New leaflets dropped over rebel territory promised safety to anyone willing to leave , an offer so far met with skepticism on the rebel side , with the government saying rebels eastern Aleppo to let people out . " We give you 24 hours only to take the decision to leave , " one leaflet read . " Your worn , rotten leadership outside is unable to get you out . "
