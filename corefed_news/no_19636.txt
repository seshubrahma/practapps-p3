’     ’ ’   ’ ’ After nearly 30 years of writing , Michael Lewis has tackled    Michael Lewis first love story . ’ ’ Lewis , the author of " " and " , "    didn’’t go the typical romance route , though . Michael Lewis new book ,    " , " tells the story of Daniel " Danny " Kahneman    and Amos Tversky , two best friends who revolutionized cognitive    psychology . ’ ’ As Lewis put it to Business Insider , the relationship between    these two brilliant Israeli psychologists " was a love story    without the sex . " ’ " Kahneman ’s and Tversky ’s personalities and ideas perfectly    complemented each other ’s . ’ " Kahneman’s and Tversky understood each other in ways no    one else could , and this resulted in groundbreaking work on    judgment and    through the 1970s and ’80s . " ’ Tversky died from cancer in 1996 , but Kahneman has continued    to develop Kahneman ideas and generate many new ones , and Kahneman was    awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 . ’ " Kahneman and Tversky ’s theories have influenced medicine and    public policy , and led to the founding of behavioral economics    and an analytic approach to crafting professional sports    teams . " ’ And while their work has been explored for many years , Lewis    was in a unique position to tell the human story behind the ideas     —    Lewis    taught Tversky’ ’s son Oren during Lewis    teaching fellowship    at the University of California at Berkeley in the late ’’ 90s and    would later help Kahneman shape Kahneman 2011 bestseller , " . " ’ ’ We sat down with Lewis    to discuss " The Undoing Project , " and    how Kahneman and Tversky’ ’s ideas can offer a valuable lens for    viewing Donald Trump’ ’s election , Wall Street , and sports . ’ ’ This interview has been edited for clarity and length . ’ ’Richard Feloni : A central theme of " The Undoing    Project " is the fallibility of human judgment . This entire    election season was filled with surprises not predicted by polls    or pundits on either side . How do you look at this election year    using Kahneman and Tversky’ ’s theories ? ’ ’Michael Lewis : When I wrote " The Undoing    Project , " I was not thinking of the American election , and I did    not think Donald Trump was going to be elected president . But one    of the great things about Amos Tversky and Danny Kahneman is they    give you a lens for interpreting human behavior and you can    filter the whole election through they . ’ ’   ’ "    The first thing they would say is people do n’t like uncertainty ,    and they minds are tools for making sense of the world , even    when the world is senseless . they dislike uncertainty so much    that they will impose an order on it an order when it an order n’t exist .    And in they leaders , advisers , and experts , they much prefer    overconfidence , total certainty , to any kind of doubt . " "    I ’d say part of the appeal of Trump is that he Trump presenting    himself Trump a totally certain , infallible person . " "    Then there ’s anchoring . Amos and Danny did these studies where    they Amos and Danny give their Amos and Danny subjects a wheel of fortune with the    numbers one to 100 on it and have them Amos and Danny the a wheel of fortune with the   numbers one to 100 on it And then ,    after subjects get a number , they Amos and Danny them Amos and Danny they Amos and Danny the    percentage of countries in the United Nations come from Africa .    And    who had spun a high number would guess a higher    percentage than people who had spun a low number . Amos and Danny    showed that you could anchor the mind into answering a question a    certain way by giving them a totally unrelated piece of    information dropped before . " ’    Trump’ ’s anchoring people every which way . " There are millions of    illegal voters . " Everything’ ’s " huge . " I don’’t think he’ ’s doing it    consciously , but he does    well in kind of inserting himself       those kind of chinks in our mental armor . ’ ’Feloni : What about looking at the way that those    who opposed Trump are struggling to accept it ? ’ ’Lewis : Danny and Amos studied the rules of the    human imagination when it tries to undo something , tries to    create an alternative reality . Say a loved one dies in an    accident . You imagine , " If only they hadn’’t been on that train    when it went off the rails   —    if only . " After the election , some    people tried to undo Trump . They started some   people the outcome and    worked their way some   people to find the first thing they could some   people to    change    outcome the outcome the first thing they could some   people was the    FBI director stirring up trouble about Hillary’ ’s emails , when    really there are all kinds of things that could have happened    that would have changed the election . ’ ’    The last thing I’’ll say is that Danny and Amos pointed out that    when something happens people didn’’t predict , they find ways Danny and Amos    explain it as if it were predictable it And you see this in spades    in our country right now . You’’ll be amazed by how many people    will have " predicted " this thing a year from now , who didn’’t see    it the day before Election Day . The tone of the commentary is    already like , " If you had been out there and you’’d taken the    pulse of the ordinary American , you’’d have seen you’’d coming , you’’d as if    it were       of intelligence . But that’ ’s not what it was at that’ all ! It was a kind of accident . He got almost that’ million fewer    votes than Hillary Clinton ! He happened to that’ more in some of    the right places . It was just like one of those things where a    stock going up and people impose a false sense of order on it .    It’ ’s    more intellectually honestly viewed as a disorderly    process .    ’Feloni : What made you want to tell the story of    Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky ? What do you want readers to    learn about    personal lives readers ’ " WATCH : Why Lewis wrote ’The Undoing            Project’ " " Lewis : I Lewis find with my stories that the    way they start is that I just get so interested in a person that    I ’m compelled to go back to them over and they until I learn more    and more about them , without they quite thinking it ’s material    for a    . Maybe I ’m thinking it ’s a it piece . What set me    over the    with this story was , one , the sheer level of    interest of    two main characters . They have great the two main characters    dimensions . Two , the peculiar passionate relationship between    them , which the two main characters a love story without the sex . Their children were the two main characters ideas . " ’    And three , was just the influence of their ideas . Their children see them    everywhere Their children There are people in medicine who will tell you that    they’’ve deeply influenced medical diagnosis and the way doctors    think about    jobs . doctors    Wall Street , you go back to the    origins of the suspicion of stock picking , the beginning of the    movement toward index funds , and their fingerprints are the   movement toward index funds over    that . They’’re also all over " Moneyball , " the whole statistical    movement in sports . Every place where big data and algorithms are    challenging experts , you will find Kahneman and Tversky in the    room . ’ "    There just are n’t many stories that are this good . It was a    really good , really important story , and I had peculiar access to    it .    ’Feloni : How do their personal stories shed light    on their theories ? their ’   ’ ’    The thing about their relationship and the intensity of their    feelings their each other was that it was so important in their    work their    ideas are all about human fallibility   —    human    vulnerability , even   —    and their origin largely The ideas with Kahneman exploring his own Kahneman , his own Kahneman .    But he was Kahneman of doing that by himself , Kahneman part because he    Kahneman so unsure of himself . Kahneman created a Amos place in which    Danny felt not only Danny but a kind of unconditional    acceptance and love . ’ "    The strength of that relationship is what enabled them to explore    what ’ "    weak in people . And it was the great insight into    themselves   —    particularly ’ "    into Danny   —    that was the    source of their idea generation . So ’ "    ’s not surprising that when    the relationship started to fracture that the ideas also started    The ideas up . " ’Feloni : Your previous book , " "   —    about   gathering a team to take on what he felt to be    abuses of    trading   —    also had protagonists shaking    things up . In the    years since that was published , his firm ,     has become he    exchange and is planning on listing companies in 2017 . Your book    had the effect of making them celebrities of sorts . Are they    meeting your expectations ? them " Lewis : They have exceeded Lewis expectations . The    world around them has also exceeded my expectations They their    attempts my expectations them They actually improving the markets They I    think the game is slightly changing    and that because they ’re now    an exchange ,    can generate    showing what is       the grift that goes on in other exchanges   —    what it costs    investors to trade on those versus    an exchange like IEX that    is actually trying to level the    field and not give      traders an advantage . The game is going to be    the game information now . "       I didn’’t know what the reaction to " Flash Boys " was going to be ,    because although I have written other    Street books , I’’d    never written one that threatened to take away money from people .    And it’ ’s still unclear how    those sums of money are , but it’ ’s    clearly billions It’ dollars a year . Now I know what happens when    you do that   —       generate essentially an opposition political    campaign against a book . It was as fraudulent as many political    campaigns are . ’ ’ WATCH : Lewis explains how Wall Street Lewis            changed Wall Street    And the truth is , this is n’t my war to fight . It ’s Brad    Katsuyama ’s war to fight this —    I am an interloper . I came in because    I was really interested in a pretty simple thing : what happens    when someone tries to introduce moral considerations into Wall    Street , what happens when someone wants to actually demand of    himself and those who work with him that what someone do is not just    someone but good and useful . " "    I feel a little bad for Brad Katsuyama and the people at IEX   —      they ’re on their own doing this   —    but I they it ’s going to be    OK . It this   take a little while , but I this   they ’re going to be a    very , they big part of the stock market . " " Feloni : Polls increasingly show . What does Wall Street look like to you Wall Street compared to when you were in it in the    ? " ’Lewis : What’ ’s    to Wall Street since    " " came Wall Street ’’ 89 is that its relationship with the rest    of society has become much more problematic . It’ ’s become cagier , It’ more guarded , closed , and afraid of how it seems to the wider    world . More political . But it’ ’s not clear to It’ it’ ’s become less    It’ ! ’ "    If you ’re the kind    kid who thinks that all that ’s important in    life is making money , it ’s probably still the    to go ,    especially all that’s important in   life that Trump ’s elected . Trump Street now    you have    to hide Wall Street ’re doing . It ’s more fun when    do n’t have to    do that . But I do n’t think its sense of purpose    changed at    all . " ’   It "    Now , the exception is that there are disruptors who are trying to    fix the financial system with entrepreneurship , like Brad    Katsuyama .    find great purpose there , but you may not find    great profits when the game you ’re playing is making a living       reducing the size of Wall Street , sucking some of the revenues    out Wall Street , and reducing the tax the    levies on    the rest of    economy . You ’re not going to get rich    that    like you get rich figuring out how to increase the tax . " ’Feloni : You discuss in the introduction to " The the tax Project " the legacy of your book " Moneyball " and its    protagonist , former Oakland A’ ’s General Manager Billy Beane .    Since The   Undoing Project book was published in 2003 , the analytics approach to    Your book    pro sports team has become standard . How can scouts be    useful    this environment ? ’ ’Lewis : I thought about this back when       Moneyball " was published . Billy Beane , he didn’’t ask for my       , but I told him , ’s General Manager Billy Beane.    this army ’s General Manager Billy Beane.    scouts , and       not doing what they should didn’’t doing . They’’re eyeballing    the players and judging    they can be    this army of scouts based    on small they’’re sizes , the games they happen to this army of scouts . You get a    much better picture of their professional potential when this army of scouts    dealing with a big body of data . ’ "    this army of scouts scouts should be doing is figuring out if these players have    a drug problem , if they may have a difficult time living away    from home , if they have weird problems these players their teammates , if    they do n’t listen to their coach these players or if they ’re these players an injury .    these players you should do is these players hire a bunch of these players journalists    to go figure    who these people are , because some of that    information will    helpful . " ’    The trick is figuring out what the algorithm does well and what    people do well . ’ " WATCH : Lewis weighs in on Trump ’s Lewis election    ’Feloni : One of the narrative arcs that shows up    often in your work has an outsider   —    maybe this person was    laughed at by people in positions of power   —    and then this person       on to shake things up and influence the people who once    mocked him . Does Trump fit into one of Trump Michael Lewis    stories ? ’ ’Lewis : this person Laughs ] The problem is my characters are    actually usually pretty smart and admirable and I don’’t think    he’ ’s either . So the answer is " unlikely " ! You never know . Look ,    just because you’’ve been successful and just because you’’ve    disrupted an environment , doesn’’t mean you’’re a role you’’ve or    that you actually have anything to teach anybody . There’ ’s an    awful lot of luck and accident in the world , and maybe you were    just on the receiving end of that . ’
