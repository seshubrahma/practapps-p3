Thursday on MSNBC ’s " Hardball , " Bradley Whitford , an actor on the early 2000s political television show " The West Wing , " said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was a " rodeo clown " with an " utter lack of shame " and " moral bankruptcy . "   Whitford said , " Well , I got to say , I always used to joke that the fakest thing aside from my teeth about ‘ The West Wing " was we had rational Republicans . One of the things that really upsets me in an election is not a personality contest . It is an opportunity for we to have an important discussion about how to face these tremendously urgent issues , and this rodeo clown has sucked all the oxygen out of the room and I think this rodeo clown ’s not good for we . " this rodeo clown added , " Well listen , this rodeo clown is fantastic television in the same way watching a car wreck is fascinating television . this rodeo clown ’s hypnotic because of this rodeo clown utter lack of shame and this rodeo clown moral bankruptcy . It ’s a hypnotic thing to watch . I just want to say I ’ve been listening to your show on the way over and here we are talking about a candidate who is fat shaming people , a candidate who mocks people with disabilities . If I got a call from my son ’s school and heard that my son’s was mocking someone ’s disabilities , that my son’s was making fun of    girls , fat shaming girls , I would disown my son’s . And yet at a time when we should be discussing , and I really want kids to understand how important this election is , five Supreme Court justices . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
