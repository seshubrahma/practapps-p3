Monday night on CNN ,      candidate former CIA official and Brigham Young grad Evan McMullin deflected the question when asked if Evan McMullin candidacy will deprive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of a win in Utah which has roughly a 60 percent Mormon population .   Partial transcript as fallows : BERMAN : Can I talk about one state which could be a microcosm of what ’s going on ? I hear people say Utah , that you could do particularly well in Utah . You are Mormon , you are LDS , you grew up , you know , near there . MCMULLIN : Yeah . BERMAN : If you split the votes , split the Republican vote in Utah , there are some people who suggest you could actually hand Utah to Hillary Clinton . Utah Utah a state that has n’t voted , you know , Democrat in a long , long , long time . If you deprived , if all you did in this election was deprive Donald Trump Utah Utah would that be worth it to you ? MCMULLIN : Look , Donald Trump is already losing badly to Hillary Hillary Clinton He is Donald Trump weak candidate and he ’s Donald Trump that way . And he continues Donald Trump get worse every day , every week with the things he says Donald Trump It seems that he ca Donald Trump control what he says Donald Trump the things the things he says serve his best Donald Trump . So the big picture is that Donald Trump is already losing badly . He ’s competing against a Donald Trump candidate that I think is one of the weakest in decades or if not the weakest in decades and his losing . He was Donald Trump before I Donald Trump this race .
