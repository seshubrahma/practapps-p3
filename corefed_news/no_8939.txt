Earlier on Tuesday , President Barack Obama accused Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of " whining " for President Barack Obama repeated statements on the upcoming presidential election being " rigged " at a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi .   " The notion that somehow if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of "whining" loses Florida , it Mr. Trump loses Florida because of those people that you have to watch out for , that is both irresponsible and , by the way , does n’t really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you want out of a president , " Obama said in response to a reporter ’s question . " If you start whining before the game ’s even over , if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose , you start blaming somebody else , then you do n’t have what it takes to be in this job because there are a lot of times when things do n’t go our way or my way . However , a rally at Kent State in Ohio in 2008 ,    presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama ( ) had a much different response to a similar question . After boasting that his Democratic Party were " in charge " of the voting machines , Obama admitted both sides had historically " monkeyed around with elections " to " tilt things in their both sides . " Exchange as follows : QUESTIONER : I would just like to know what you can say to reassure us that this election will not be rigged or stolen ? SEN . BARACK Obama Well , I tell you what , it helps in Ohio that we ’ve got Democrats in charge of the machines . But , look , I come from Chicago . Some want to be honest , it is not as if it is just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past . Sometimes Democrats have , too . You know , whenever people are in power , they have people tendency to try to , you know , tilt things in their direction people That ’s why we have got to have , I believe , of voting rights division in the Justice Department that is    and that is serious about investigating cases of voter fraud , is serious about making sure the people are not being discouraged to vote . That is why the voting rights legislation that was put in place a couple years ago to help the county clerks to make sure the machines were in place that were needed are important . That is why we need paper trails on these new electronic machines , so that you actually have something that you can hang on to after you punched that letter to make sure it has that letter been hacked into . I mean , those are all part of the process of making sure that our democracy works for everyone . And one of the great things about this election has been all the interest that has been taken in this election this election mean , when I spoke Thursday night , there were more of yours then watched the finals of " American Idol . " Now that is big . That ’s big . That ’s big . And I hope a lot of people are watching the Republican convention . I want people to have information . Then I want to make sure that our democracy is working the way it should be our democracy And this is near and dear to my heart because when I was a lawyer , I practiced voting rights law . And I filed a lot of lawsuits . In Illinois , I helped to make sure that you could go ahead and get registered at driver ’s license facilities   —    at the DMV . So I ’ve been working on this for a long time . I think the more people participate , the more they are paying the more people ultimately , the better off everybody is . Immediately    Republican Party chairman Bob Bennett cried foul . Bennett issued a Republican Party chairman Bob Bennett accusing Obama of " " and attacked    Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner by accusing her of " Jennifer Brunner " with the state ’s elections system . " Barack Obama ’s outrageous statements today basically amounted to an endorsement of   . That may be how you win elections back in Chicago , but Ohioans tend to frown upon the idea of massive voter fraud , especially when it ’s floated Ohioans a presidential candidate . Jennifer Brunner ’s Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner Ohio ’s elections system and her firing of elections Jennifer Brunner’s for political reasons has been disturbing enough , but it now seems the    team are openly wearing the same partisan jersey . Ohioans will not stand Ohioans this blatant disregard for the integrity of our elections system . "
