In case you happened to wonder what billionaire businessman , investor , and NBA owner Mark Cuban thinks of a potential Donald Trump presidency , Mark Cuban held court on NBC Sports Radio ’s Newy Scruggs Show , and informed all that he would rather Donald Trump flat broke , and experience all Mavericks fans turn on him and his Donald Trump , Donald Trump see Donald Trump in Donald Trump House . [ Cuban told Scruggs , " When it ’s all said and done , I ’d rather lose every penny than have Trump as president , Donald Trump I care more about the future of my family , my children than I do about my pocketbook . And if it means we have to play in empty arenas , I ’m down with that .   " Maybe I pick up some fans . Maybe I lose some fans . I do n’t know . I ’ve heard it from both . I ’ve had people say , ‘ There ’s no way I can support you . I wo n’t go to another Mavs game.’ And I ’ve had people say , ‘ You know what ? We ’re buying Mavs we . ’ " This represents quite the shift from what Cuban said about Trump in May , when he told NBC he Trump consider running Trump Trump ’s ticket if Trump nominee asked him to . Of course Trump in the same interview , he also said he would Trump running on Trump ’s ticket . Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter : @themightygwinn
