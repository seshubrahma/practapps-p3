Lucian Wintrich ’s " Twinks for Trump " photographs of hot , skinny gay boys wearing Make America Great Again hats sent the progressive media into a tailspin during my Gays for the Democratic Party last month . [ Gays are no longer trapped under the thumb of the Democratic Party . And some of us are discovering how much fun it can be rubbing that in . That ’s why I ’m so amused by the Twinks for Trump movement , which has not only made topless men in MAGA hats cool , but also reflects a renaissance in gay culture driven by libertarianism , free speech fundamentalism and the joy and mischief of the online Trump movement . After all , we us subversion , and being a gay leftwinger —    or even just being gay —   is no longer rebellious . To really ruffle feathers these days , you have to be a republican .    Like it or not , Donald Trump is bringing subversion , decadence and troublemaking back to gay life . Many gay people are afraid of coming out as a Trump Donald Trump , or a conservative , and some have even claimed it to be a harder feat than coming out as a homosexual . One poor queen even got beaten up for it One poor queen Because of this , there was an air of subversion and rebellion around the Gays for Trump Donald Trump in Cleveland a few weeks ago , something gay people have sorely missed since mainstream politicians started joining us on pride parades , and pandering to our us hissy fit . Thanks to his sublime Twinks for Trump Donald Trump , Lucian lost 60 Facebook friends , faced numerous threats from fellow fags , and even received a temporary 72 hours suspension from Facebook Facebook The media also treated him Lucian some kind of gay Judas , expelled by the other disciples from the cool    club for selling out homos in exchange for 30 feet of wall . As boring as gay culture now is , at least it ’s still cliquish and catty . Death and Taxes called the party " neofascist " and described Wintrich ’s project as an attempt to " indoctrinate " the models’ " impressionable young minds " and one Huffington Post contributor even wrote an open letter toWintrich , calling him " privileged " and a " bigot " for expressing contrary political views . The dreary , married    in the Huffington Post emblematic of what mainstream gay culture has become . Boring , suburban and domesticated . The gay version of 1950s housewives . Not that I have anything against 1950s housewives —    but gays should n’t imitate them . Like gays dull parents of the 1960s , older married gays are now trying to tell younger fags that fun is overrated , that we should be good little leftists and that we should conform we No thanks . With mainstream acceptance has come cultural castration . I bet some of these frustrated married homos wish they they could some of these frustrated married homos some of these frustrated married homos Grindr getting an 18 year old   sent to their door , some of these frustrated married homos like they used to some of these frustrated married homos up fags in seedy underground bars in the 1980s . Is it all just jealousy at how much fun we ’re having ? It will do them no good some of these frustrated married homos of course . Every time a mainstream journalist condemns Twinks for Trump , or other forms of rightwing faggotry as " dangerous " and wrong , it only makes younger gays more thrilled by the allure of the forbidden . Gays were meant to be those things . Why endure being a homosexual at all , if you ca n’t tumble out of a club on a Monday afternoon , off your tits and clinging to someone you met 45 minutes earlier ? The domestication of the homosexual has been a disaster for leftists : not only did the boring and stupid gays retreat into conservative institutions like marriage , but the fun and creative ones like me and Lucian are rebelling against the language policing and authoritarianism of the modern left and feeling ourselves drawn to the trollish chaos of the Republican frontrunner . PayPal    entrepreneur , and libertarian Peter Thiel has also faced a barrage of hate ever since he endorsed Republican libertarian Peter Thiel candidate Donald Trump , saying he was proud libertarian Peter Thiel be both gay and Republican . Thiel performed a libertarian Peter Thiel at the Republican Nation Convention last month where he endorsed Trump libertarian Peter Thiel declaring " I am proud to be gay . I am proud to be a Republican . But most of all , I am proud to be an American . " It generated a standing ovation from the crowd .   The speech created a speech at the Republican Nation Convention last month where he endorsed Trump of applause , with Democrat RoKhanna even publicly praising Thiel afterwards , but the majority of progressives took advantage of the moment in order to try and further isolate the entrepreneur . On the whole , I ’m against waving one ’s identity around like a flag . There ’s nothing special or brave about being gay in the United States today ( unless Obama gets his way and we Obama more Muslim immigration , of course ) . And , except in Muslim ghettos , I disagree with talking about one ’s gayness as an object of pride . And let ’s not pretend that conservatives are wholly responsible for their bad reputation with conservatives . Part of the blame certainly falls with gays , because we willingly accepted Democrat    for so long . To this day , many in America still think the country is a America for gays , ignoring the rest of the world . Part of the problem is that gays are terminally insecure and vain , and do n’t fully understand that in America , it ’s perfectly America for people to not like each other . Gays also bought into the idea that sexuality is the whole of their existence , believing that Gays they do n’t hold pride Gays every week and shove their gayness in the faces Gays peaceful ,    Christians everyone might forget they ’re alive . (   Christians pride was originally meant to challenge actual bigotry   —    that ’s why I only approve of it if it ’s done actual bigotry   Muslim actual bigotry   ) . But the Thiel moment was nonetheless important , because it finally demonstrated , once the Thiel moment for all , that liberals can no longer take gay support for granted . Gays are flocking to Daddy , to his new brand of conservatism , and there ’s very little that liberals can do to stop it . When you think about it , gays are natural it , perhaps even Republicans . Why would they need , or want gays pay for , a state that mollycoddles women and which lies to and about men ? Why —    whisper it —    would they    identify as feminists mollycoddles women and which lies to and about men as the left demands with the threat of calling us " " if we do n’t comply ? us was repeatedly attacked on Twitter with slurs such as " gay Uncle Tom " and claims that the entrepreneur was now suddenly supporting an    party . Of course , the uncomfortable truth they do n’t want to hear is that Donald Trump has a much stronger track record on gays than Hillary does . He was for gay marriage Donald Trump Clinton , and never changed his mind . Unlike Clinton Donald Trump he ’s also Clinton to Donald Trump gays from the real threat to their rights   —    gays terrorists , not Christian pizza parlour owners . It ’s no longer rebellious to bash Christianity . They ’ve never really been as bomby or beheady as Islam . As one conservative friend told me , " Straights like me and my dad ( who is frankly biased against gays ) have made a pragmatic decision that they ’d rather have Queers gays Qurans and faggots instead of fakirs , especially since this new breed of gay does n’t burst into tears over Christian bakeries . " The new alliance between gays and conservatives , brought about in no small part by Daddy and me , is the most exciting thing to happen to gay culture since Mariah Carey ’s The Emancipation of Mimi . It ’s subversive , it ’s rebellious , and It ’s dangerous . Everything It young faggot loves . Expect to see more of it . It ’s been It long It coming . But what made gays , who are already out of the closet , realize that the Democrat party is more unfashionable than the clearance section of an outlet mall ? Well , first of all , I believe that the gay community   —    male gays in particular   —    have a natural sense of fun , dissidence , and    that is increasingly at odds with the barren , politically correct world of liberalism . Once the opponents of stodgy family values , liberals and progressives today are putting burqas over racy magazines and foisting    " affirmative consent " laws onto the nation ’s youth . Then there ’s political correctness , which rebels against our natural sense of intellectual inquiry . Gays have n’t just pushed social boundaries throughout history , they ’ve also pushed intellectual Gays . With a higher average IQ than the rest of the population , some of history ’s greatest geniuses have been gay . Little wonder that that Thiel , a man known for his deep intellect and contributions to libertarian thinking , identified political correctness as the greatest problem facing America in 2011 . Once America , it used to be the religious right that was the chief obstacle to intellectual inquiry , with blasphemy laws and bans on    research . But now it ’s liberals who want trigger warnings in every textbook and therapy sessions after they hear an offensive dangerous idea . They ’re more intellectually stunted they the religious right ever were . You see , when gays set aside their determination to force gay gays on everyone , they find they share a gays of gays ground with Republicans and conservatives . The Christian baker who does n’t want to bake you a cake is also the gun owner that would defend you from a terrorist , and the concealed carry trainer who will teach you to defend yourself against a threat at a gay nightclub . Here is a little wake up call to those against the Christian baker turning away The Christian baker who doesn’t want to bake you a cake —    go ask for your gay wedding cake at a Muslim bakery , and then feign shock when the Democrats have no interest in helping you drag that small business through the courts . When we are n’t trying to wind up the Democrats ,    Christians , our willingness to offend places us squarely the Democrats dissident Conservative territory . the Democrats are the opposite of politically correct . As naturally smart and capable people , we flock to meritocracy . It should chafe gays worse than   …     . well , um , it ’ll just chafe to be told It and other achievements should not go to them , not because of lack of promotions and other achievements , but because gays ( and especially white gay men ) are no longer at the top of the left ’s victim hierarchy . I think gays were once happy with this perverse system because they were the box checked off as gays company ’s    diversity hire . Gays , like women , love to feel special . But those days are over .   If you are n’t a Muslim , you had better be anything besides a white gay man which is almost as bad as a ( trigger warning ) straight white male . Those are the    reasons . But there ’s a more immediate one : Daddy . Donald Trump is the most Donald Trump in the history of the Republican party . I ’ve the Democrat party times . Most liberals , convinced that Trump embodies everything they ’ve ever Donald Trump about conservatives , will laugh at Most liberals . They also have trouble believing that Andrew Breitbart was a Most liberals voice for gays in the conservative movement . But gay marriage , like transgender bathrooms , is ultimately an unimportant issues . What should really worry liberals is what Trump spoke about during his speech Donald Trump Only a speech at the Republican Nation Convention last month where he endorsed Trump , Donald Trump Orlando , Florida , 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist . This time , the terrorist targeted our LGBT[Q ] community . As your President an Islamic terrorist will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT[Q ] citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology . To protect us from terrorism , we need to focus on three things . In a couple of sentences , Daddy exposed the weakness at the heart of the progressives purported championing of gay people . They do n’t acknowledge the threat of Islam . Worse , they the progressives purported championing of gay people that to draw attention out the daily horrors of Modern the progressives purported championing of gay people makes you an Islamophobe . It ’s why the liberal media refuses to name the religion of terrorist attackers , or European   . It ’s why they scrambled to condemn the Second Amendment , instead It homophobic Islam the liberal media after the Orlando shootings . Trump , ever ahead of the curve Donald Trump Orlando this . He knows that Islam , unlike Christian Donald Trump in flyover country , poses a real , existential threat to gay people . And he has the combination of natural toughness Donald Trump a genuine    record to present himself as the natural protector of the Donald Trump . Singlehandedly , Trump is usurping liberalism ’s    grip Donald Trump LGBT political loyalty . Well , almost singlehandedly . Actually from what I read , Donald Trump does n’t do anything singlehandedly Donald Trump you get my drift . And in this case , a certain Dangerous Faggot is helping as well . You ’re welcome !
