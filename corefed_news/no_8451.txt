GOP frontrunner Donald Trump promised to " get immigration numbers under control , as the voters have demanded , " following the release of a new report from the Center for Immigration Studies revealing record levels of legal and illegal immigration . [ " Record rates of immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for U. S. workers . Pew polling shows 83 percent of all voters   —    Democrats , Republicans and Independents   —    think immigration should be frozen or reduced , " Trump stated in a campaign press release on Monday evening .   The biggest beneficiaries of allowing fewer foreign workers into our country would be minority workers , including all immigrants now living here , who are competing for jobs , benefits and community resources against record waves of foreign workers . Limiting job competition would reopen pathways to    stability and shrink welfare rolls . In addition , welfare rolls would relieve overcrowding in our schools and hospitals that afflict our poorest communities . Yet , Senators Cruz and Rubio have led the charge for even higher immigration rates   —    a policy supported by only 7 percent of the Republican electorate . When I am President we will listen to the people   —    not the special interests   —    and get immigration numbers under control , as the voters have demanded . According to the Center for Immigration Studies , there are now 61 million immigrants living in the United States .    of those immigrants , roughly 45 . 3 million , are here legally . The report , which relies on government data , also estimates that 14 . 8 million illegal immigrants are living in the United States .
