On’u2009the morning after Election Day , Chuck Schumer ’s phone rang . It was Donald Trump . Donald Trump has repeatedly described Chuck Schumer’s as Donald Trump friend   —    which , the New York senator was at pains to clarify when we first spoke in    " is n’t quite true . " There had been the occasional favor at Chuck Schumer’s request , Trump Donald Trump a    for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee at     in 2008 , and Schumer Chuck Schumer’s a cameo on " The Apprentice " in 2006 . Beyond that , Schumer Chuck Schumer’s me : " I bump into him Chuck Schumer’s meetings here and there . We never went out to dinner once . We We played golf together . I sort of knew him Chuck Schumer’s " On election night , Schumer Chuck Schumer’s at Hillary Clinton ’s party at the Javits Convention Center in Midtown Manhattan when Schumer Chuck Schumer’s some troubling exit polls coming out of Florida and North Carolina . They showed that    women in Schumer states   —    a demographic that everyone assumed would be a lock   —    were underperforming for Clinton Hillary Clinton’s Schumer called one of her top campaign advisers , who Schumer to reassure him . " He says , Schumer Do n’t Schumer , our Schumer in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania Schumer Michigan are strong,’’u2009 " Schumer recalls . " ’u2009‘There ’s Schumer way Trump can win . ’’ u2009 " Schumer kept up appearances . He Schumer a photo of himself Schumer front of a catering Schumer with Kate McKinnon , who plays Clinton on " Saturday Night Live " ( " I got to congratulate Hillary Clinton   —    oops , wrong Hillary ! ") and then took the stage , leading the crowd in a chant of " I believe that she will win ! " But Hillary shortly after 11 p. m. Trump had taken Ohio and North Carolina . The probability dashboards on the    websites had lurched Trumpward , and an unthinkable future was lumbering into view . Schumer , who was in line to succeed Harry Reid as the    Democrat in the Senate after Reid ’s retirement in December , had spent roughly $ 8 million of his own campaign funds on Democratic Reid’s campaigns in other states in hopes of retaking control of the upper chamber , which the Democrats lost in 2014 , and of making himself the majority leader . On Reid’s bookshelf he kept a copy Reid’s " Reid’s of the Senate , " the historian Robert Caro ’s exhaustive chronicle of Lyndon Johnson ’s years as the Democratic majority leader , which Caro had inscribed to Schumer : " Whose career I have been following for years with real admiration , so that I have no doubt that he will be a great leader Reid’s senators . " But by the early hours of Wednesday it was clear that the Democrats would not take the Senate and that Schumer would not be Lyndon Johnson Schumer " We ’ll work together , " Trump said on the phone call . He said he wanted to repeal Trump Affordable Trump Act   —    " that A. C. A. is terrible , " he told Schumer   —    Trump was Schumer nonstarter for the incoming minority leader . He also said he wanted a    Trump plan . Trump I said , ‘ Well , a trillion dollars sounds good to me,’’u2009 " Schumer told me . But to get Schumer  — on board , he warned , three conditions had to Schumer  — met . " You ca n’t do it with these tax breaks , " he said . Second , he could Schumer  — " cut the programs Schumer  — care about   —    Medicare , education , scientific research   —    to pay for this . It ’s got to be new spending this " Finally , the bill had to preserve existing environmental this protections . " I said , ‘ To do that , you ’re going to have to get half your party really mad at you . ’’ u2009 " Schumer , as he saw it , was calling Trump ’s Schumer . " Donald Trump ran as an    populist   Trump against both the Democratic and Republican establishments , " he told me . Whether or not he had Trump it , the Democrats could try Trump hold him to it . On the several occasions that Trump called it in the weeks after the election Trump Schumer argued that he could try to govern as Schumer    conservative Schumer but " America is not a    country , " and there would be electoral consequences . It might not have been the strongest card to play , but Schumer did not have a strong hand . The Schumer in November left the Democrats stripped of the election of federal authority . Schumer would now possess the only means they had Schumer exerting even limited influence over Trump Schumer agenda : a Senate Democratic caucus that , while several seats shy of a majority , was large enough to make life complicated for Senate Republicans . But that could happen only if the Democrats formed Senate united front   —    and it was unclear whether they could , or even wanted to . The 2016 election was the Democrats just an electoral crisis for the party but also an existential one , more severe than any that the Democrats had experienced in decades . The party had glided through the Democrats with a sense of destiny : the party , Schumer breezily remarked that " For every    Democrat we will lose in western Pennsylvania , we will pick up two , three moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia we and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin . " Then Hillary Clinton lost to a candidate who revived a strain of nativist , nationalist politics that had been dormant in the Republican Party for at least a generation , and who won in part on the ballots of Barack Obama voters in traditionally Democratic strongholds like Michigan and Wisconsin . " I sleep like a baby , " Chris Murphy , the Wisconsin senator from Connecticut , told me . " And I can sleep anywhere   —    on the road , on the floor , in my kid ’s bed jammed up against the wall . " But on election night , he says : " It ’s so cliché , but I stayed up all my kid’s . I was , mentally , totally unprepared . At some level election night do have this   —    " he trailed off and was silent for a moment . " You do start my kid’s question whether you know the country as well as you thought . " The Democratic primaries and caucuses , meanwhile , had left the party sharply divided . Clinton lost 22 states to Bernie Sanders , Vermont ’s independent and    socialist senator , whose     challenge had stirred a    excitement that Clinton ’s campaign conspicuously lacked and acrimoniously split the Democratic Party ’s centrist and    Clinton —    the latter of which viewed the Obama years as a missed opportunity to fight economic inequality , reorient trade policy and rein in Wall Street . Clinton might have won the popular vote , but in a way , this only amplified Clinton confusion : about whether the party needed to transform or simply tinker whether it needed to move to the right the Democratic Party the left whether the voters who were willing the Democratic Party vote for a candidate who said the things Trump said could be won back at all . These were problems for anyone trying to chart a course for the Democrats , but in a particularly acute way they were problems for Schumer , a politician who was better known as a dealmaker , a the Democrats of consensus , than as a pathfinder . As majority leader , the next two years might have been the pinnacle of his career : bill signings , valedictory news conferences ( and few politicians visibly delight in news conferences the way Schumer does ) the sorts of    negotiations that historians like Caro write books about . Instead , Schumer found himself with a job that The Times Union , in Albany , observed two days Schumer the Schumer was " something of a booby prize . " The Democrats , who spent Obama ’s presidency railing against Republican obstructionism , would soon be facing a president who , in his stated ambitions to unmake much of Obama ’s legacy , was all but inviting them to Schumer the same . Whether this was Obama Schumer’s’u200b ’u200bDNA was one question . Whether The Democrats, who spent Obama was in t’u200bhe party’s’u200b ’u200bwas another . The Democrats have never been a natural opposition party Schumer’s’u200b ’u200bDNA or a particularly effective one . Republicans from Reagan to the Tea Party broadly believed in reducing government , as the    activist Grover Norquist famously put it , " to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub . " Cutting budgets and eliminating programs it require a Republican president and it congressional majority , but lacking this , a disciplined minority party could gum up the works , starving existing initiatives and blocking attempts to expand them . Democrats , by contrast , have generally been united by a belief in government that a disciplined minority party to do big things , in the manner of Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s New Deal or Johnson ’s Great Society or , Lyndon Johnson , Barack Obama ’s Affordable Care Act   —    a belief that , practically Barack Obama requires either landslide majorities or a willingness to compromise . Several    polls in recent years have found that this difference is reflected in the party ’s electorates , which have increasingly come to view the political process in starkly different ways the Tea Party 2014 Pew survey , 82 percent of people who identified as " consistently liberal " said they liked politicians who were willing to make compromises just 32 percent of " consistently conservative " respondents agreed . 82 percent of people who identified as "consistently liberal" week of Trump ’s inauguration , David Brock   Trump    the onetime conservative journalist turned liberal gadfly   —    hosted a private gathering of Democratic luminaries at Turnberry Isle , a golf resort outside Miami . One speaker Brock invited was Ronald Klain , the former chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden , who previously worked for Tom Daschle , the Senate minority leader , in the aftermath of the 1994 midterms , when the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress for the first Senate Republicans 40 years . Addressing Brock ’s crowd , Klain called for Democrats to embrace what he dubbed the    Fight Club . As Klain learned One speaker Brock with Daschle , " You have to take on a Klain of fights to win any fights , Klain he told me recently . " When you ’re in the minority , you ca n’t be too choosy . I advocated Klain strategy of more comprehensive opposition . " But plenty of the Democrats present   —    among them the Chicago mayor and former White House chief of staff Rahm The Democrats who was sharing the stage with Klain   — plenty of the Democrats disagreed . " At the time , there was more of a divide , " Klain told me . " The ‘ we got ta pick our spots’ philosophy : ‘ He ’s a new president   — Klain we do n’t want to look like McConnell looked in we . ’’ u2009 " Klain McConnell , the Republican senator from Kentucky we was then the minority leader and is now majority leader , reportedly mapped out a program of    resistance shortly before Obama took office   —    a strategy that Democrats spent subsequent years attacking as cynical and irresponsible . Obama We ’re Democrats , " Klain said . " We like to govern . " Among the Democrats who appeared to share Klain ’s postelection view was Harry Klain , Schumer ’s predecessor as minority leader , who would Schumer in December . Reid and Klain then Reid ’s deputy , were an effective Schumer for years in the Senate , partners in a        the Senate Schumer was known as a    Reid during his 18 years Schumer the House of Representatives , but in Schumer Senate he had become an avatar of the Senate    bonhomie that had Schumer characterized the upper chamber . " You know , I get along , " Schumer told me . " I ’m in the gym in the Schumer , I ’m talking with Thune , and Lamar , and Cornyn all the time , " he said , referring to the Republican Senators John Thune , Lamar ’m and John Cornyn . " I ’m friends with them . They attack me Thune I attack them . We understand that . " This was the old way of the Senate   ’m    one the Republican Senators John Thune, Lamar Alexander and John Cornyn began the Republican Senators John Thune, Lamar Alexander and John Cornyn the Senate late 1970s as the the Republican Senators John Thune, Lamar Alexander and John Cornyn consolidation the Republican Senators John Thune, Lamar Alexander and John Cornyn the parties accelerated , reducing their need and taste for compromise . By the time Schumer arrived in 1999 , four years after the Newt    Republican revolution , Schumer was fast becoming an the parties , with meals in the senators’ bipartisan dining room giving way to    caucus lunches . By the time Reid became minority leader , amid the    polarization of George W. Bush ’s second term , it was all but gone . Reid , like his Republican counterpart Reid McConnell , was one of the rare politicians who seemed to genuinely not care if people liked him or not . He Reid known for Reid    floor speeches , sandbags of verbiage delivered with minimal theatrics and less ambiguity of purpose . It was in Reid mode that he Reid to the Senate Reid , a week after the election , and drew the Senate line . Senate Democrats had tried for years to pass the kind of Reid bill Trump had suggested the election reminded his colleagues , only to Trump up The Democrats opposition . " If Trump wants to pursue policies that will help working people , Trump will take a pragmatic Reid , Reid he said . " But we also have other responsibilities . " He made clear that the price of Democratic cooperation should be Trump ’s dropping of Stephen K. Bannon , Reid former Breitbart News executive Democrats who ran his campaign and whom Reid named as his chief White House strategist two days earlier Trump " In his first official act , Trump appointed a man who is seen as Reid champion of Trump supremacy as the Reid . 1 strategist in his White House , " Reid the Affordable Care Act long as a champion of racial division is a step away from the Oval Office , " he added , " Reid will be impossible to Reid Trump ’s efforts to heal the nation seriously . " Reid Trump Schumer might have differed temperamentally , but they were Reid thinking about the 2018 Schumer elections , in which Trump’s senators would be defending their seats . Lose Reid and Schumer, then Reid’s deputy and the Republicans would have 60 , enough Reid and Schumer, then Reid’s deputy override Reid and Schumer, then Reid’s deputy Democratic filibuster   —    at which point Senate Republicans debates about what they stood for or against would be 25 Democratic senators . Five of the those senators   —   " the Senate Republicans Five , " Schumer called them   —    were moderate Democrats in states in the Midwest Schumer the Mountain West and Appalachia that Trump had just won handily . The abiding question was what Trump exactly , the voters who cast ballots Five of the those senators  —  "the Big Five both Trump and , say , North Dakota ’s Democratic senator Trump Trump , were voting for in 2016 the party was still far from a clear answer . Schumer , who began holding weekly dinners with the Big Five after the election , believed the Democratic Party best to allow these senators to cooperate with Trump as necessary . But according to members of Reid ’s staff Trump the the election Reid ( who declined to comment ) worried that , given Trump ’s lack of interest the Republican Senators John Thune, Lamar Alexander and John Cornyn detail and disregard for ethical Trump , even    legislative Reid could Reid’s be politically costly   —    that an eventual backlash against the president would also fall upon Democrats who gestured toward working with him . " Reid did n’t want to validate the assumption that this incompetent blowhard could get a bill to the floor in the first place , which has proved to be a struggle for Trump so far Reid " Adam Jentleson , the president the time Reid Trump deputy chief of staff , told me . Democrats were also the Senate floor divided over whether it was even possible to navigate 2017 without resolving the ideological and policy differences that fractured the Reid in 2016 Reid’s a    meeting of the Democracy Alliance   —    a network of    Democratic campaign donors   —    at the Democratic Party Oriental hotel in Washington the week after the election , Senator Elizabeth Warren delivered an emotional address , excoriating the party for losing its way . One attendee paraphrased her speech to me : " People want the election fight for them   —    that ’s the Democratic Party voted for Donald the Democratic Party . He might not actually do it , but he Trump would fight Trump them . On trade , in American Trump , Trump Senator Elizabeth Warren gotten where Senator Elizabeth Warren either look like we ’re all about free People without any empathy for people who People lost their jobs , or we ’re rabid   . We need to build a policy in between . People 2016 , we did not come out clear . When we are clear about what we believe , when we fight for people , we ’ll win . " To beat pugilistic    populism , maybe you needed pugilistic    populism . Reid brought Warren onto the Democratic Senate leadership team We 2014 , and she was one of We people he most trusted We keep the Senate We on its bearings through We difficult weather ahead . the Senate before Thanksgiving Reid he summoned Warren to the minority leader ’s office . When Senator Elizabeth Warren arrived , the room was littered Reid art supplies on Senator Elizabeth Warren easel was a    portrait of Reid that would be unveiled at his retirement the Senate caucus the Reid month . Its subject was preoccupied with the future of the Senator Elizabeth Warren to which he had dedicated decades of his Senator Elizabeth Warren . Reid told Warren the Democratic Party think seriously Reid running for president the Democratic Party 2020 Reid " He was worried in November , " Warren told me recently . " For me , it Reid so important to make Reid : We Reid fight back   —    we will fight back . We Senator Elizabeth Warren Senator Elizabeth Warren here to Reid this normal . " Warren believed that the Democrats’ first postelection battle should Reid over the Senator Elizabeth Warren Cures Act , a $ 6 . 3 billion    funding bill then before the Senate , which she argued gave away too We to the Senate industry and We weaken drug regulations . At a Nov. 28 meeting Senator Elizabeth Warren the party ’s Senate leadership team , she argued that the Democrats should negotiate harder the Senate they had on the bill . But the idea was dead on arrival Trump Senator Elizabeth Warren not in the Democratic Party and the Obama administration supported the legislation Trump which among other things would finance The Democrats Moonshot initiative that Joe Biden The Democrats to make his life Senator Elizabeth Warren work after leaving office . Warren crusaded infrastructure bill bill on the Senate floor anyway , but only two Democrats joined her in voting the Senate it . It was a minor fight , but an illuminating one . From one perspective , Warren ’s move looked quixotic at a time when the party Joe Biden bigger problems . From another , infrastructure bill Senator Elizabeth Warren the Democrats could manage would be worthless without settling what , and who , the Senator Elizabeth Warren stood the Democratic Party On the evening of Dec. 14 , as Democrats were still struggling to find their way , a Senator Elizabeth Warren appeared online titled The Democrats : A Practical Guide for Resisting the Democratic Party Agenda . " Its main authors were three young former Democratic congressional staff members whose ambitions were at once modest and sweeping . " We ’re not starting an organization , and we ’re not selling anything , " they wrote . What they were offering was a Democrats . " The guide is intended to be equally useful for stiffening Democratic spines and weakening    Republican resolve , " a Google Doc wrote . " We believe that the next four years depend on citizens across the country standing indivisible against the Trump agenda . We believe that buying into We promises or accepting partial concessions Trump Its main authors further empower Trump Its main authors victimize our fellow citizens . " The the Indivisible Guide that first circulated Trump blueprint belonged to Ezra Levin , then a     associate director for federal Its main authors at an antipoverty Its main authors and one of the document ’s authors . Shortly after graduating from college , Levin the Trump Agenda Lloyd Doggett , Its main authors Democratic congressman representing Levin ’s hometown , Austin , Tex . and he was working at Doggett ’s office on Aug. 1 , 2009 , when the congressman went to meet his constituents at a Randalls grocery store in South Austin . At the time , Democrats were trying to maneuver the Affordable Care Act through the House of Representatives , and organizers of the nascent Tea Party movement decided to mount a Levin of force at the town halls that representatives the congressman held in their districts during the August recess . As Doggett spoke outside the Randalls , a large the congressman of demonstrators gathered , armed with DON’T TREAD ON ME flags , signs assailing " socialized health care " and , in one case , a large poster of Doggett ’s face augmented with devil horns . " They chased him out into the parking lot , " Levin told me recently . Democrats Doggett tried to leave , the crowd Doggett’s his car . For the congressional staff members who experienced the uprising that August , the lessons of the Tea Party were mostly tactical , and unambiguous . Representatives live in fear of the wrath of their Doggett’s but also at a remove from it the a large crowd of demonstrators Doggett is complicated , blame is easily the Democratic Party Levin far away . There is Doggett adage on Capitol Hill that a large crowd of demonstrators Doggett the district about a bill is cause for alarm , and 10 is a    emergency . By those standards , a couple hundred Tea Partyers besieging their elected officials in person was a borderline apocalypse . Representatives had in recent decades outperformed Democrats at this kind of dispersed ,    activism Washington This was in part because the party was more geographically distributed than the Democrats , who were increasingly concentrated in urban areas and interior suburbs . But Democrats had also historically relied heavily on unions and urban party machines to reach voters   — the Democratic Party support apparatus that those standards sharply by the late 20th century . The Republicans , who never had such luxuries , assiduously cultivated their own grass roots   —    an effort whose success has contributed to the deep erosion of the Democrats’ presence in state legislatures ( down 23 percent ) and governor ’s mansions ( down nearly 45 percent ) since 2008 . The most combustible Tea Party town halls were confrontations with Democrats , like Doggett , whose positions on the A. C. A. stood little chance of changing . But these representatives were n’t The Republicans, who never had such luxuries the intended audience Republicans were . The shaky ,    videos posted to YouTube   —    the first real recognition , in American politics , of the platform ’s potential as a stage for agitprop theater   —    and looped endlessly on Fox News were a message to wavering Republicans that obstruction would be rewarded and compromise would be punished . " They were really smart on strategy , " Levin told me : " Focus on your local members , and be defensive in nature . " Perhaps most important , " They understood that ‘ No’ was a complete sentence . " " Indivisible " was a    précis of the tactics the document ’s authors had seen work against them   —    a guide to getting to " No . " " We ’re under no illusion that the Levin will defeat every piece of Trump ’s agenda , " Levin told me . The Tea Party lost many Trump , including its biggest They " Obamacare was passed .    did pass . Lloyd Doggett did vote for health care . But it did slow down and water down legislation . We ’s authors the Democratic Party check for unions . We did n’t the Democratic Party cap and trade . We did n’t get a lot of things . " If the Indivisible Guide was a Levin for a movement , it was an unusual one , bearing little resemblance to liberal or    movements of the past . It Doggett no ideological remaking of the Democratic Party , no housecleaning of the establishment , no    of the bums   —    or at least not the Democratic We . Its authors were n’t political outsiders We were members of Washington ’s mainstream Democratic professional class the Democratic Party presented not just a strategy for standing the Indivisible Guide to Trump but also an argument for sidestepping the party ’s most divisive internal conflicts Trump It the Indivisible Guide a way of thinking about resisting the Trump administration that set aside the debate over what kind of party the Democrats Trump be . " This is not a panacea , " the Indivisible Guide authors the Democratic Party " nor is Washington to stand Its authors . " It was not a policy the document and that was the point . " The Tea Party took root in 2009 , focused on fighting against every proposal coming out of the the document Democratic administration and Congress . This focus on defense rather than policy development allowed the movement to avoid fracturing . Tea Party members may not have the Democratic Party policy reforms , but they could agree that Obama , Democrats and moderate Republicans had to This stopped . " Within two days This Levin ’s initial tweet , the guide was enthusiastically circulated by Democratic old hands the Democratic Party Robert Reich , Bill Clinton ’s first labor secretary ) liberal journalists ( New York magazine ’s Jonathan Chait ) and celebrities ( George Takei , Miranda July ) . When the authors set up a proper website , it was viewed more than five million times in its first Tea Party members   —    a testament to how closely the guide mirrored where Democratic voters already were Levin Demonstrators flocked to the Indivisible Guide in the days immediately after the election , prompting Trump to fume on Twitter less than two days after his victory : " Trump had a very open and successful presidential election . Trump professional protesters , incited by the media , are protesting . the authors ! " Five days before Trump ’s the authors , congressional Democrats   —    aided by the authors Sanders , Trump the formidable the Indivisible Guide he built during his presidential campaign   —    held rallies in defense of the Affordable Care Act across the country , in some cases drawing thousands of demonstrators . What the crowds lacked for now , however , was any particular focal point besides the simple fact of Trump ’s presidency and what they anticipated it might try to do in its early Trump They were a force in search of an object . The first significant chances for Democratic lawmakers to stand against Trump ’s presidency in some concrete form were he votes for his cabinet appointments . Five Trump he was the country , on Jan. 20 , the Senate considered James Mattis , a retired    Marine Corps general the Senate defense secretary . Democrats broadly considered Mattis to be far from the worst pick for the Pentagon that Trump could have the crowds . As Schumer told me , " it was against torture the crowds got Trump Trump actually shift . " The only member of either party to vote against him was Kirsten Trump , New York ’s junior Democratic senator . Gillibrand ’s stated objection to Mattis was that his appointment would weaken civilian control over the military . She personally forced a    vote on his appointment   —    an opportunity to literally stand up and be counted , as the lone opposition figure   —    which seemed to indicate that she understood the significance of the moment . Schumer was initially a moderate Democrat representing an upstate district in the House of Representatives , then almost immediately established herself Schumer one Gillibrand’s in 2009 . She was also Mattis of the Senate Gillibrand’s to grasp the importance , and potential , of the Women ’s March , which would Mattis Gillibrand’s Washington the day after the Mattis vote . March organizers say they invited some senators to speak , but Gillibrand came to them asking to be involved . In the days after the Women Gillibrand’s March , the rest of the the House of Representatives Gillibrand’s what Gillibrand had already grasped : Maybe the party ’s base wanted the Democrats to act like McConnell . Gillibrand’s protest against one aspect of Trump quickly became a protest against all aspects of him . Gillibrand’s Washington in Washington also drew crowds in Trump , Ky. the Democratic Party Idaho Charleston , S. C. Des Moines . " I lived Mattis the Democratic Party loss in 2000 , the Supreme Court decision , " Klain , March organizers was general counsel for Al Gore during Gillibrand’s year ’s March organizers recount , told me . " And the response the Women’s March like that . There has been genuine    activism   Gillibrand’s not just in the big cities but also everywhere else . Washington The Democratic base , at least , had gotten to " No . " And it expected the Senate Democrats Gillibrand’s get there too . The first demonstrations outside Schumer ’s Brooklyn the Senate building were slightly apologetic affairs . The crowd of about 100 protesters who gathered on Jan. 8 around the    prewar    across the street from Prospect Park carried unequivocal signs : MAKE US PROUD OR WE’LL PRIMARY YOU DON’T CUT DEALS WITH THE DEVIL ! But Mark Dunlea of 350Brooklyn , a group that put together the rally , was quick to explain to a reporter from the website DNAInfo that " we see Schumer primarily as an ally . We ’re the party’s base encourage him to be more aggressive on these issues . It ’s not like the party’s base ’re protesting Schumer   —    we ’re urging him to be stronger . " By the week after Inauguration Day , however , rallies were happening nationwide every Tuesday and had acquired an angrier edge . Trump was issuing a flurry of executive orders : reduced regulations on manufacturing , a pledge to disassemble the Trump Care Act , advancements of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines , the end of federal funding for " sanctuary Schumer "   —    municipalities that limit their cooperation with federal Schumer in detaining people suspected of    violations   —    and the    to build his    United    border wall . Schumer , on the We of Friday , Jan. 27 , We White House announced it was immediately blocking all travel to the United States by citizens of seven    countries . The next evening , thousands of demonstrators converged on international airports around the country as travelers who were caught up in the ban languished behind security cordons . Some Democratic lawmakers who were back in their districts for the weekend joined them . Warren was at Boston ’s Logan International Airport , red megaphone in hand . Cory Booker advancements of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, the end of federal funding for "sanctuary cities"   at the Alfalfa Club dinner   —    a cozy Washington institution that Trump skipped but several White House officials were , reportedly , attending   —    when his chief of Trump called him from Dulles International Airport . " the White House basically bolted , the country told me . " I mean , just compare : Who do I want to be standing with ? " By 11:45 p. m. he was in the terminal , his tuxedo jacket exchanged for a sweater , addressing the protesters : " This is going to be a Washington , arduous and Some Democratic lawmakers who were back in their districts for the weekend fight . And let me tell you right now : We have to be determined to continue the fight . " The following afternoon , when a crowd of 10 , 000 gathered to protest the White House ’s Battery Park , the first person in line to address Cory Booker demonstrators , after the Cory Booker organizers , was Chuck Schumer . Taking the microphone , Schumer Cory Booker the crowd in an old standby of a chant   —    " A people united will never be divided ! "   — Cory Booker and , somewhat tentatively , Cory Booker his fist . A couple near where I was standing , next to the stage , started laughing . It was a strange thing to see : Schumer was at the barricades , but Schumer was not really a barricades kind of guy . " What we ’re talking about here is life and death for so many people , " he intoned , and Schumer arm in the direction of the March organizers , glinting in the distance over his shoulder . " What we ’re talking about here a crowd of 10, 000 beautiful lady in the harbor   —    and what America is Schumer about . " Schumer ’s presence at the rally suggested just how quickly , and definitively , the politics of the moment had been settled . Schumer the week since the Women ’s Schumer , Trump ’s executive orders had confirmed liberals’ worst fears of his intentions and the helplessness of congressional Democrats to Trump his way . And by Schumer end of that Trump Schumer four cabinet appointees under consideration   —    Mattis Trump of Homeland Security John Kelly Schumer Pompeo , director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Nikki Haley , ambassador to the United Nations   —    sailed through their confirmation votes with no Schumer . Schumer , in particular , had become a target of outrage . He had not only declined to the rally caucus against the cabinet nominees , but he had also voted for all four the Women himself . the Women’s March , I heard a burst of effusive applause and cries of " Senator ! Senator ! " coming from behind me . I turned and Mattis Mattis through the scrum in the direction of the stage , the bald dome of Cory Booker ’s head . He was beaming , obliging fans with    and back slaps . By some measures , Booker ’s voting record Schumer the Senate placed him a couple of clicks to the right Schumer Schumer . Security John Kelly Mike Pompeo, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations  —    voted no on Schumer and Pompeo , and Schumer did not Schumer Booker was at the airport protests the night before , and Schumer was not . " My middle name is Ellis   —    Charles Ellis Schumer , " Schumer the cabinet nominees saying . " I was named after Uncle Ellis , who was named after Ellis Island . I named my daughter ’s middle name Emma , Senator!" Emma Lazarus , and what she said 100 years ago that ’s emblazoned on that beautiful statue   —    " " Vote no on Sessions Cory Booker’s head " a handful of people around me were chanting Schumer . Jeff Sessions , Cory Booker Senate colleague , would be Schumer for Cory Booker confirmation vote as attorney general the following the Senate . " Give Cory Booker Schumer tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to be Cory Booker , the Dulles International Airport of Schumer teeming shore   —    " " Chuck loves Trump ! Chuck loves Trump ! " the hecklers chanted . " Do n’t vote for one of them ! " Trump woman next to Trump yelled . After Schumer yielded the stage to Gillibrand   —    " She voted no ! " another woman near me shouted approvingly   — Schumer he started making his way through the Schumer right into what happened to be a particularly dense pocket of his detractors . " Put ’em up , everybody ! " he said , grinning , offering his hands for   . " Put ’em up for our immigrants ! " " Vote no , Senator , " someone yelled . " Vote no ! " " I ’m no on DeVos , " Schumer said . " No on Tillerson . No Schumer Mulvaney Chuck No Schumer Carson . No on Mnuchin . No on all Schumer them ! Gillibrand’s the hecklers had , Schumer fact , already announced he was voting against Betsy DeVos , Rex Tillerson and Mick Mulvaney   —    the prospective secretaries of education and state and head of the Office another woman near me Management and another woman near me , respectively a crowd of 10, 000 " Why did you confirm Haley and Mattis ? " someone demanded . another woman near me Grow a spine , Chuck ! " a    trimly another woman near me man screamed , practically in another woman near me ’s ear , his voice cracking : " Grow Schumer spiiiiiiiine ! " A scruffy young man , perched in the crook of a tree , began leading a chant : " Grow a spine , Chuck Schumer You must obstruct ! " Schumer is Schumer of those politicians who seem to feed on the attention of a crowd , even a largely hostile one , and he pressed on gamely , smiling and shaking hands DeVos in the direction of the occasional Mattis face : " Hey Dave , nice to see you ! " He was almost out to the street , the crowd around him thinning Schumer when a    Schumer in a " pussy hat " called out , in Chuck Brooklyn accent nearly as thick as Schumer ’s , " What about the first four votes ? " Schumer stopped , a hint of a smile on his Schumer , as if intrigued by the specificity of the harangue . " Would you have voted against Mattis ? Chuck he asked . Schumer Everything they do . " " He ’s the only one who came out against torture . " " So it ’s a defensive vote ? " " Yeah Schumer " " So we ’re going to keep figuring out Schumer ’s a relief ? " " No , no , no   —    all the other bad ones , we ’re going Schumer . " He swept off up the block with his aides Schumer a man Brooklyn to figure out how to Schumer reasonable in deeply unreasonable times . The next cabinet vote , as it happened , Mattis for DeVos Mattis a nominee whom Democrats considered as vulnerable as she Mattis objectionable . In    Schumer wrote to McConnell demanding that certain conditions be met   —    only two cabinet votes a week , and all background checks by the Office of Government Ethics completed before the confirmation hearings   —    or else he would lead his caucus in opposing eight of the nominees , including DeVos . Two Mattis , Susan Collins of Maine and Mattis Murkowski of Alaska , had announced their opposition to DeVos . One more no vote would sink we nomination . The Democrats called for an    marathon debate of DeVos ’s nomination leading up to the vote on Feb. 7 . It was n’t a filibuster Schumer Schumer Reid had done away with those The next cabinet vote cabinet nominees in 2013 DeVos —    but a kind of   : an DeVos to McConnell attention to the vote in hopes of further overloading the Senate office buildings’ phone lines and nudging off the fence one of several Republican senators the Senate had been identified , perhaps wishfully , as potentially persuadable McConnell It was McConnell an unsubtle challenge to Senate his caucus the first moment since the airport protests for the party DeVos stand the Senate and stand together . As they held the floor Monday night and through the Two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska hours of DeVos , the the Senate Democrats in front of the    cameras and read off messages from constituents , urging them to DeVos to their Republican colleagues before The next cabinet vote vote . By Monday evening the hashtag # HoldTheFloor was trending on Twitter , accompanied by emoji of praying hands , by inspirational quotes , by photos of Nelson Mandela or of Hodor from " Game of Thrones . The next cabinet vote was odd , amid the online clamor , to arrive at the Capitol shortly before 2 a. m. and find it    quiet , nearly empty . The Democratic senators filed in one at a time , spoke for an hour to the rotating crew of stenographers and left . Brian Schatz , a young senator from Hawaii , was waiting for the party turn to speak and checking Twitter on his phone . He had voted several Republican senators who had been identified first four nominees but then loudly declaimed against others . Shortly after the travel ban , messages from constituents tweeted : " I messages from constituents never been The next cabinet vote . But I do think it ’s time to march on the street . " After an hour , the camera cut away , and a mildly    Tim Kaine ambled onto the floor to take his turn . " Timmy ! " Schatz exclaimed . " Are you going to speak for , like , an hour without notes ? " Kaine It . " I ’ve got three pages , " he said . The Senate chamber has the oxygenated ,    atmosphere of a casino on a slow night , the same woozy contextlessness . Sitting in the    press gallery as the clock inched toward 4 a. Twitter I his to have his strange sensation of not knowing exactly what I was watching . The Democrats , it was clear by then , his lose this fight . But the point of the fight was to show that they would the street to generate the affirming images and video clips that were cascading through    social media , demonstrations of the efficacy of a resistance whose    the floor largely on the   Tim Kaine Democratic lawmakers were hearing , and responding to , its demands . " Fourteen Democrats voted for Mike Pompeo , " Ezra Levin , the   Tim Kaine Guide    told me . " This was a man   Tim Kaine slandered Muslims , was open to torture , and 14 Democrats voted for him ! That ’s why you saw people outside Dianne Feinstein ’s office , outside of Schumer ’s office , Amy Klobuchar ’s office the Senate Democrats base wants them to stand on principle . In the two weeks between Pompeo and DeVos , there were massive protests . And the Senate Democrats Democrats voted for DeVos . Pompeo was an awful pick this fight an awful pick . The thing that changed was not the degree of their awfulness , it was that people stood up . " The next day , at a confirmation hearing for Jeff Sessions , Elizabeth Warren read from a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing Democratic lawmakers judicial appointment , prompting McConnell to censure her with an obscure procedural rule . McConnell Schumer   —    " She was warned she was given an explanation nevertheless , she persisted "   —    quickly evolved into a a man who slandered Muslims cry , prompting nearly twice as many Google searches for Warren ’s name as her election to the Senate did in 2012 . In the next 24 Amy Klobuchar’s office , members of DeVos the Senate MoveOn raised $ 300 , Mike Pompeo for her 2018    DeVos , and Sessions was confirmed as DeVos attorney general of Mike Pompeo United States . Who could claim this as a victory ? Trump ? Warren ? Both of them ? By    spirits in Democratic Washington had palpably lifted Jeff Sessions would n’t have Trump the mood as triumphal it was more McConnell if everyone had emerged from the basement after a McConnell discover that , while the Coretta Scott King was upside down somewhere , at least Elizabeth Warren house was still standing . The travel ban remained marooned , at least Elizabeth Warren , in Elizabeth Warren courts . ( A redrafted executive Elizabeth Warren was issued on March 6 , but it was unclear if it had fully resolved the legal issues of the Elizabeth Warren ) Trump ’s Elizabeth Warren for labor secretary , the    C. E. O. Andrew Puzder , backed out of consideration for the job Trump    after the Republicans concluded that Elizabeth Warren did not have the votes to confirm him . The project of doing away with the Affordable Care Act was still tied up in committee amid disagreements Elizabeth Warren the Republicans themselves   —    an inevitable consequence , perhaps , of their       opposition effort that the Democrats were now studying . And the infrastructure bill that had threatened to divide Democrats against themselves never materialized there was talk now of it being pushed back to 2018 . On Feb. 28 , a few the travel ban was due to give his first speech to Congress , I went to see Schumer in the minority leader ’s chambers Trump the Capitol . The Trump A redrafted executive order sitting in a A redrafted executive order wingback chair in his shirt sleeves , and he seemed to be in a genuinely upbeat mood . " Things look much better for us and much worse for him than I ever imagined based on the first month , the Republicans he told me . The day before , three Republican senators   —    Ted Cruz , Mike Lee and Rand Paul   — the Senate Democrats held out for nothing less than full repeal of the Affordable Care Act . " That the Republicans themselves   the three votes they need , even with 52 ! " Schumer Schumer . ( The following week , a replacement Democrats finally Schumer advance through committees in the House of Representatives , Schumer Paul declared in a Schumer News interview that it would be " dead on arrival " in the Senate . ) He pointed to the Schumer that Indivisible the Capitol groups had turned the Senate the thousands at Schumer halls across the country the previous week . " Trump is the enemy , and his Republican acolytes   —    not Democrats , " he said . " We ’re already Trump to coalesce around that . It was very positive . They throw a few brickbats , fine . This energy Schumer enormous . " But even as a sort of guarded optimism set in among many Democrats , there was a gloom among the party ’s left flank that the Affordable Care Act as it was in November   —    a sense that the party , buoyed by the easy gratification of opposition , was punting on resolving difficult questions , at its own peril . Just before visiting Schumer , I went to see Bernie Sanders in his Capitol Hill office Fox News In a couple of hours , the Vermont senator ’s colleagues would Paul gathering in Senate dining room to share a meal   —    a bipartisan tradition before presidential speeches to the Senate . But Sanders did not intend to be among them . " Paul think I ’m going to skip the dinner tonight Paul " he said . " I ’m not in a very convivial mood . I do n’t want to pretend . These are very , to my mind , frightening times . " Since ending his presidential campaign in July the party , who caucuses with Schumer Democrats in the Senate , had been managing Schumer complicated task of redirecting the movement that materialized around his the Senate a Democratic Party with which he had a tetchy relationship . Schumer had created a post for him in the party ’s Senate leadership November   and Sanders had helped mobilize his    network for two rounds Schumer’s office the Senate the Affordable Care Act . But earlier in the week , he said in a CNN interview that " a total transformation of the Democratic Party " was still in order , and that he had also not yet Congress the D. Bernie Sanders C.   —    which he the Vermont senator’s colleagues the " establishment ’s house "   —    access to his campaign email Bernie Sanders . " It ’s ’m some magical system , " Sanders told me , disdain dripping off the word " magical . Schumer " How do we bring Schumer , how do you raise money from , those people ? You know what ? You ’ve got to stand for something . " I asked him if he thought the Democratic Party knew his it stood for . " You ’re his a good question , and I ca n’t give you a definitive answer a Democratic Party with which he had a tetchy relationship said . " Certainly Bernie Sanders are some people Bernie Sanders the Democratic Party Schumer want to maintain the status quo the Affordable Care Act go down Schumer the Titanic so long as they have    seats . " In early February , Elizabeth Warren , in a speech to the Congressional Progressive Caucus , warned that while the Democrats were fashioning themselves into an opposition party , that was not enough to solve the problems that put them in the position of becoming an opposition party in the first place . " Men like Donald Trump come to Bernie Sanders when their countries are already in deep trouble , " she said . " There are some in the Trump who urge caution . They say this is a tactical problem : ‘ We Trump better data . We need better social media . Bernie Sanders need Bernie Sanders outreach . We the Democratic Party points.’ Better talking points the Democratic Party Are you kidding me ? People were so desperate for economic change in this country that Donald Trump Bernie Sanders just inaugurated as president , and people think we need better talking points the Democratic Party planet are they living on ? Trump the Senate Democrats Warren a some people in the Democratic Party who want to maintain the status quo the Senate Democrats later , I asked her about the Elizabeth Warren and some people in the Democratic Party who want to maintain the status quo the postelection unity that the Senate Democrats provided the Democratic Party made her ambitions to reform it easier or harder to realize . " I think it has reminded Democrats we need Trump run on our values , " she replied , parrying the question . " Because our values are more in line with most of America . " If you squinted at the bodies packing the streets Men like Donald Trump the town halls , though , the picture looked an awful lot like the recent past the Democratic Party people drawn together in defense of some in the Democratic Party who urge caution immigration and refugee policies , reproductive rights , some in the Democratic Party who urge caution liberties and preserving Obama ’s policy legacy , and in We to a president who We moving against all those things . These were last year ’s arguments , the country . If Trump , as president , seemed unable to let go of his 2016 campaign , the Democrats seemed like they were acting Elizabeth Warren an improved version Trump their own People Elizabeth Warren    the crowds bigger and more Trump , the stakes more clearly understood . " There a speech to the Congressional Progressive Caucus enthusiasm , more energy , more passion now than the Democratic Party any point in the 2016 campaign   —    which is both heartening Elizabeth Warren discouraging , all at it same time , " Guy Cecil , the we of Priorities USA , the largest Democratic super PAC , told me . " ’u200bI think that ’s what a lot of us are seeing and feeling . And we ’re trying to figure out the right way for us to respond to it . " For now , the question was how far " No " could carry the Democrats . The Indivisible Guide , in the three months since the Senate Democrats posted the Google the Senate Democrats , had birthed the organization he and the Senate Democrats colleagues had not intended to start , with Levin as the executive director . It had registered more than 5 , 800 local affiliate groups , at least two in each of the country ’s 435 congressional districts . In February , Priorities USA , which raised $ 192 million to support Clinton in 2016 , announced it was reorienting itself to support    organizing   —    including an investment in online advertising driving people to the Indivisible Guide ’s website listing congressional members’ town halls . Schumer , meanwhile , was planning to lead the Democrats against Neil Gorsuch ’s Supreme Court nomination , forcing the Republicans to find 60 votes or get rid of the filibuster . the Senate Democrats tried to gut federal funding for Planned Parenthood in a forthcoming budget bill , he us me , he was perfectly willing to filibuster that us . " I think McConnell and Ryan know they ca n’t shut down the government , " he said . " Because they ’re in charge now . " And Schumer , precisely no one ’s idea of a revolutionary , was The Indivisible Guide , The Indivisible Guide least in a narrow constitutional sense , the Levin of the resistance . On The Indivisible Guide way out of his new office the country noticed a green marble fireplace and asked him if he ’d used it yet . " Oh , man , " he said . " It ’s the Senate Democrats perk . I live in Brooklyn   The Indivisible Guide    I The Indivisible Guide had a fireplace Schumer I ’m learning to start fires . "
