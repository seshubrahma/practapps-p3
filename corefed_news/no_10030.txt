Friday on his HBO program , host Bill Maher followed up on a tweet in which host Bill Maher called San Francisco 49ers    quarterback Colin Kaepernick an " idiot . "   # colinkapernick is an idiot . I support #colinkapernick protest , but stick to what u know : kneeling and interceptions , and then look up " false equivalency "   —    Bill Maher ( @billmaher ) September 28 , 2016 ,   During the " Real Time " segment , Maher said Kaepernick was a " fucking idiot , " but not for Maher protests . Instead Maher said it was due to Maher series of " false equivalencies " Maher had made about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton . " Let ’s go to the point of false equivalency , " Maher said . " Because I think it ’s very relevant to what you ’re talking about . And I have one more fucking idiot I want to get to . I tweeted Maher is a fucking idiot , and Maher is   —    Colin Kaepernick . " " Maher is , Maher is , " Maher continued . " Maher ’s a fucking idiot . I ’m for Maher protest . I ’m for Maher taking the knee . " Maher went through a list of false equivalencies , all of which Maher had said Kaepernick was incorrect to suggest Clinton was as bad as Trump .
