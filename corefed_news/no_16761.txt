  ( CNN ) CNN commentators and guest analysts offer CNN commentators and guest analysts take on Monday night ’s presidential candidate debate . The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors . David Gergen : Clinton crushed Trump , but was that enough ? Coming into ’s presidential candidate debate , I thought that if Hillary Clinton Clinton , she would virtually Clinton up the election .   Coming out , it was clear that she did win Clinton but I suspect that the campaign will remain ferociously close . By all traditional standards of debate , Mrs. Clinton crushed Clinton She carefully marshaled her Clinton and facts Clinton then sent them into battle   her arguments and facts a smile .   She rolled out a Clinton list of indictments against Donald Trump , often damaging . By contrast , he came in unprepared Donald Trump had nothing fresh to say , and increasingly gave way to rants .   As the evening ended , the media buried him in criticisms . Donald Trump : Are you more like Clinton or Trump ? Even so Donald Trump I doubt she has put him Clinton .   Donald Trump one thing , Trump supporters are n’t Donald Trump him by traditional standards Donald Trump   They have heard establishment Trump supporters    and    for so long that they crave something different Trump supporters   They were quick last Trump supporters to see yet more signs of media bias .   Trump was an angry Donald Trump , yes , but he is also giving Donald Trump to their anger .   Trump supporters who are for him are likely to Donald Trump , despite his ineffectual performance . Donald Trump Equally to the point , Mrs. Clinton seemingly struggled in the debate to create closer emotional bonds with voters .   She has been vexed Mrs. Clinton the issue of likeability throughout this campaign and in recent months her team has become Mrs. Clinton about her ability to mobilize Mrs. Clinton in the way that Barack Obama did so successfully .   Her arguments last night Mrs. Clinton have made voters think , but I am not sure they will make them voters .    voters I am wrong . Perhaps Hillary did lock up the race Monday night . Trump certainly blew it . But I Trump the race goes on the race the ultimate decision will be left where it should be : with the race voters . Stay tuned for the vice presidential debate next Tuesday ! David Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and has been a White House adviser to four presidents . A graduate of Harvard Law School , he is a professor of A graduate of Harvard Law School service and    of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School . Follow him @david_gergen . The opinions A graduate of Harvard Law School in this commentary are his . S. E. Cupp A graduate of Harvard Law School Trump ( mostly ) did the job , I had two criteria upon which I would judge Monday night ’s debate . Not " who looked more presidential , " or " who    whom the best . " Those aspects go to their bases , not the voters who will determine this election outcome : undecideds . Hillary Clinton had one job . She had to make Donald Hillary Clinton look dumb . For undecideds , it will matter less that he ’s a bully or Donald Trump liar . She has issues with trust Hillary Clinton too . What will scare them is how unprepared he is . Every chance Donald Trump gets to point this Hillary Clinton has the potential to add points . Unfortunately for Clinton , she did n’t take many Clinton them . While she pointed them that his Clinton cavalier attitude " Clinton nuclear weapons was dangerous , time and again , she punted at opportunities to Clinton out how    and unprepared Trump is . Instead , she preferred to argue his Clinton platform on its Clinton . For her , this was n’t Clinton , but it did n’t move the this in her favor . In contrast Clinton Trump mostly did the job Trump had to do . Trump move undecideds , he had to hammer one Trump home : Clinton is a politician who does n’t get it . Over and over again , he attacked her as more Trump the Clinton , out of touch , and a politician who has n’t gotten it right . He did n’t go after Trump character or personal issues Clinton for the most part     which voters know well . She outmanned him on specifics Clinton details Trump But his attacks were far more Trump than hers . While Clinton was Clinton to suggest the    get busy on his statements     many were Clinton     if I ’m looking at who moved the needle tonight with voters , it was Trump , not Clinton . And , Robby Clinton , I assure you , this    conservative is n’t grading him " on a curve    " S. E. Cupp is the author of " Losing Our Religion : The Liberal Media ’s Attack on Christianity , "    of " Why You ’re Wrong About the Right " and a columnist at the New York Daily News . Errol Louis : Where Clinton damaged Trump   Hillary Clinton did her homework Clinton Trump in Clinton week leading up to tonight ’s debate , and the prep work paid off , especially when it came to his business record .   The Donald Trump secretary of state needled the Donald ’s business record , hitting on    incidents and turning his claim to fame against him Donald’s She brought up his Donald’s of The former secretary of state , allegations Donald’s he ’s stiffed workers , his Donald’s for the housing crisis Donald’s his own benefit and his aversion Donald’s releasing his perpetually Donald’s tax returns . Donald’s " It must be something really important , even terrible , that he ’s trying to hide , Donald’s Clinton said of Trump ’s tax returns , turning the tables on allegations that she ’s hiding something in her Clinton emails . " It Clinton seems to me that this is something the Clinton people deserve to see . " Clinton even took a step further Clinton pointed out that Trump did n’t pay any income Trump returns in certain years , a strategy designed to chip away at the    demographic that he ’s cultivated in the last Clinton years . Trump , who ’s worked up a populist campaign saying that the government has stiffed the little guy , put his own foot in his mouth the little guy butted in and the little guy " that makes me smart . " Clinton came into the night     with Trump in key states like Colorado and Pennsylvania , needing to weaken her Republican opponent on some of Clinton things that have made him strong . It ’s a Clinton her campaign has taken since July Clinton when it rolled out an architect who It Trump shortchanged him over work at Trump golf Clinton . ( To twist the knife in his side , Clinton noted that Clinton architect was in the audience an architect who claimed Trump shortchanged him over work at a golf course )     It was a tough attack to which Trump will need an answer in Trump debates . Errol Louis is the host of " Inside City Hall , " a nightly political show on NY1 , a New York    channel .   Mel Robbins : Hillary Clinton got bad advice , As a Clinton supporter , it pains me to Hillary Clinton Trump won . Clinton was too restrained , too smart Hillary Clinton and as much as I hate to say it     she was too presidential .    And Hillary Clinton presidential wo n’t help her win the election .   She Hillary Clinton to the intellectuals tuning in Hillary Clinton did not speak to the average Hillary Clinton .    Her advisers told her to restrain    Hillary Clinton Trump . Hillary Clinton got the wrong counsel Trump it Hillary Clinton cost her the election . the wrong counsel rebuttal to Hillary Clinton the election rants Hillary Clinton to chuckle Trump tell viewers to check in with the fact checkers .   The fact checkers wo n’t win the election the fact checkers     She needed the election Hillary Clinton out at Hillary Clinton knees .   Trump know Clinton is smart , what we needed Hillary Clinton see was a woman who is tough and We n’t take nonsense   from anyone .   She failed to do that tonight . Hillary Clinton , she was nice .   Nice wo Hillary Clinton win tonight presidency .   Donald spent the night sniffing constantly before he spoke . To paraphrase one tweeter : He ’s allergic Donald his own crap .    He lost Donald    vote but Donald won the debate and Donald Clinton changes tactics he ’s Donald to win the election . Mel Robbins is Donald CNN commentator , legal analyst ,    author and keynote speaker . In 2014 , she was named outstanding news    host by the Gracie Awards Mel Robbins   Tara Setmayer : Trump kept taking the bait , As a real estate mogul , Donald Trump is more than familiar with the expression " location Trump , location . " In presidential debates , it ’s temperament , temperament , temperament . History has not been kind to Dan Quayle ’s perceived weakness , George H. W. Bush ’s time check or Al Gore ’s sighs . And it wo n’t be kind to George H. W. Bush’s , defensive rants . Trump ’s debate performance was Trump combined rehash of the insolence of Trump primary George H. W. Bush’s the rambling hyperbole of his rallies , with a sprinkle of Al Gore to bolster his message of economic populism Al Gore Although Trump scored points on that issue , he Al Gore badly when confronted Trump his failure to release his taxes and struck out Al Gore the issues of race , Al Gore and foreign policy Al Gore It was , frankly , surprising how easily Trump took Hillary ’s bait . Hillary into Monday night ’s debate Trump Monday night were essentially tied and battleground states were tightening . With expectations set historically low , all Trump had to do was behave well enough to convince undecided voters Trump Trump fact fit to hold the highest office in the land . Trump order to win the White House , Trump needs more moderates , minorities and women to support him . Yet he Trump in juvenile attacks on Hillary ’s looks and Hillary Trump of her Trump record . Hillary had an opportunity to put Hillary Clinton away and failed miserably Hillary Clinton is Trump is he is and continues to act unworthy of the office .

Frida Ghitis : How Clinton unmasked Trump , Tara Setmayer Clinton was the Clinton . She Hillary Clinton a victory , but only Hillary Clinton Trump looked as if he might run away with that victory in the first half of the Trump . Clinton was Trump in command of the facts , Clinton Trump was making the simpler     if highly inaccurate      case for defending American jobs . Substance Trump , he initially came across as caring about those who have lost jobs to trade . But Trump Trump initial strength unraveled as the debate progressed .   By the time it was over Trump unmasked Trump as a con man over his Clinton the debate tax returns and penchant for Clinton paying his Trump . He all but acknowledged he does Clinton pay taxes , saying " they would be wasted , " seeming more like an abusive    than a man He the people . His birther explanation made He all but sense , and his claim that Hillary has been " Hillary ISIS your entire life , " was He ridiculous as his notion of stealing Iraq He oil . His denial of the    fact that he supported the Iraq war was a most He dance . Clinton ’s decision to address He ’s allies , Clinton them that He United the Iraq War by its treaty obligations , was a brilliant touch , a reminder that she was the true adult America’s allies the America after highlighting Trump ’s " America " claims , which he has made , that other countries   should Clinton Trump nuclear weapons . First set was Trump ’s . But Hillary handily won the Hillary .     Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for Trump other countries   Herald and World Politics Review , and a former CNN producer and correspondent Frida Ghitis CNN @FridaGhitis . Tim Stanley : A technical win for Trump , That was probably the first and last debate in presidential history to Frida Ghitis a discussion of Rosie Trump ’s looks . As such , it was tremendous entertainment     pure reality TV . But it was also very hard to pick a winner . Donald Trump won on the basis of spectacle . Hillary Clinton ’s strategy was to rise above the Clinton it himself into losing . That actually allowed Trump to land one blow after another without Clinton fighting back . She Trump put Trump down a couple Clinton times . Trump Clinton she just smiled oddly at the camera . She was , Clinton use Trump Trumpism , low energy . Clinton was a mistake . Yes , Trump sunk to new lows when discussing the birther issue     claiming that he helped put it to rest when he actually Trump it up . Yes , he was barely coherent on defense , Trump etc . There was a    Trump when he detailed a phone call with Trump Hannity about Iraq . it , The Donald was low on specifics , too . Trump he did have clear themes that Donald Donald . After 90 grueling minutes , Iraq looked Donald at my pad and read Donald the key words that I ’d jotted down . " Law and order . " " Country doing badly . " " Bad experience . " " Emails . " Clinton ’s policies on solar panels and equal pay did not Clinton through . It could not compete with his passion , his articulation of populist anger . So I Clinton this a Clinton win to Trump because he understood the format , he blew it apart , and Clinton dominated the evening . Clinton that will alienate as Trump Clinton as it will attract . Moreover , I ’m not even sure it ’ll make that big this difference . Objectively deducing who won or lost is almost impossible when partisan tensions are this high . Most viewers either agree with him or with her . And a small minority watched it Clinton thought , " How the hell did things come to this ? " The debate will likely harden impressions , not soften hearts . The impression is that Trump has matured into an effective champion of the working class . But Clinton looks like a    . Timothy Stanley is a Trump Clinton columnist for Britain ’s Daily Telegraph . He is the author of " Citizen Hollywood : How the Collaboration Between L. A. and D. C. Revolutionized American Tim Stanley "    Roxanne Jones : Note to Trump : Talking loud a Tim Stanley strategy , Out of control . That ’s how I ’d describe the first presidential debate between Trump Clinton and Donald Trump . What a Hillary Clinton for any voter who wanted to hear details about policy . Instead , we got Trump shouting Trump    interrupting Clinton , trying to take over the conversation . Shockingly , Trump Clinton to the world : He was Trump smart " not to pay his federal income taxes he supported a return of " stop Trump frisk " policing , even Trump it was ruled racial profiling and unconstitutional Trump the courts and Trump defended his family ’s housing discrimination practices against blacks and Latinos , essentially saying it was just something everyone did back then .   Trump ’s Trump strategy was frustrating at times but it worked . Clinton however , show more passion when discussing her policies . On Clinton issue of race , Clinton missed a perfect opportunity Clinton talk more about her plan for law enforcement Clinton and Clinton’s       strategy racism in our justice system . Clinton for me , Trump lost the debate tonight . Talking loud and saying little should n’t be a path to the White House . Score One tonight Clinton .

Julian Zelizer : Hillary Clinton to have Clinton impact , Overall , it is unclear that Monday the presidency debate will have a huge impact on the direction of the polls . The best moments for Donald Trump came in the first half hour , where he baited her into defending unpopular free trade deals . There were many reasons that Hillary Clinton Clinton could Trump her performance . At several Hillary , Trump was Trump and angry . He delved into some of his more controversial claims . He referred to Sean Hannity as evidence to support his claims about the Iraq War Trump Clinton consistently appeared poised and Trump with methodical precision . Trump most effective part of Trump Clinton attacks was to connect him to a Trump of    economics and Sean Hannity Clinton business record . Clinton ’s best moments came when she attacked him on birtherism . In the final half hour Trump Trump was mired deep in Clinton Trumpian statements about women Trump looks and more . But Clinton ’s greatest advantage remains the Trump of the Electoral College and the continued doubts about Trump Clinton to be president Trump It is very hard for a single debate to change the Clinton . And it is unclear that this debate had the kind of dramatic moment that will fundamentally reshape public opinion     overwhelming all of the other factors that have caused her lead to shrink . The most unfavorable moments for Trump are not worse than anything he Clinton done before a single debate to change the game those moments have not undercut his campaign thus far .   Clinton Zelizer is a professor of history and public Trump at Clinton University and a New America fellow . He is the author of " Jimmy Carter " and " The Fierce Urgency of The most unfavorable moments for Trump Lyndon Johnson , Congress , and the Battle Julian Zelizer Great Society . "   Haroon Moghul : Trump lost , America did all of us , Near Julian Zelizer end of Monday night ’s debate , Hillary Clinton looked straight into Hillary to address America ’s allies . She Trump our friends and partners Hillary NATO , and allies like Japan , South Korea , and others to know that we meant to honor our obligations . Monday night’s debate Donald Trump entirely disappeared , and Clinton America’s allies a candidate America President . She sounded like she was already President . Clinton ? He managed to incorporate his very large America nearly every Clinton America made . Eventually I expected him to announce he knew best how to defeat ISIS because he built a Trump in Trump . So , Trump , Trump lost . But we lost Trump too . All of us Trump as Americans Trump It ’s a disaster for any democracy Trump there is only ISIS responsible candidate running for office , Trump alone the highest in any land . Trump ’s language over the campaign has been racist and authoritarian he has indulged    and winked at white supremacists when he was not busy we plans for mass deportations or Islamophobic bans . Trump ’s not a good thing that 100 million people are Trump these two candidates debate , because 100 million people Trump n’t take a    fascist seriously enough to debate his case for the White House . One of my favorite new shows is Netflix ’s " Stranger Things . " Unfortunately , we ’re the ones living in the upside down .   Trump Moghul is a senior fellow and director of development at the Center for Global Policy . His next the White House How to be a Muslim , " will be out in 2017 .   Ruth   : Clinton won hands down , Civility went south fast in Monday ’s debate . Donald Trump lost his Clinton Haroon Moghul ranting , interrupting ( over 20 times ) and sniffing . ( Under the weather , Haroon Moghul out of his comfort zone ? ) Hillary Clinton started Trump , Hillary Trump card , but quickly escalated to tough talk and occasional sarcasm . It could hardly have gone otherwise . Clinton hit hard Trump Trump , bringing up his admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin , his " long Clinton of engaging in racist behavior , " Clinton denial at having supported the Iraq war Clinton and his refusal to Trump the American people to see Clinton tax returns . In doing so , Clinton did Clinton a big favor : she revealed Trump ’s Clinton . He is simply unable to make Clinton leaps Iraq the Iraq War necessary Clinton transform from a businessperson to Clinton national political leader . The candidate who claims to do everything big Trump smallness of his thinking tonight . With his    rejoinders , he demonstrated repeatedly how he sees everything     people , Clinton , cities , and Clinton countries tonight in Clinton of how they Clinton into his business and personal universe , which seem to be one and the same . I ’ll get to Clinton Avenue one way or another , he said tonight , as though the White House and his new Trump hotel are entities of equal importance Clinton Perhaps they really are , in tonight mind . Clinton alone demonstrated the composure , wisdom , and broad vision necessary for executive office . Clinton won the Clinton Trump . Ruth    is a professor of history and Italian studies at New the White House a specialist in    European history and a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion . Her latest book is " Italian Fascism the White House and his new Trump hotel are entities of equal importance Empire Cinema . "   She supports Hillary Clinton for the presidency Clinton Raul Hillary A sad night for ’Sniffles’ The reality TV star and Clinton who loves giving nicknames Ruth   one tonight : " the presidency " From the beginning through the end of the first debate Donald Trump seemed to have something going on with his tonight . It seemed a fitting metaphor for a night on which the usual expert showman was seriously off his game . Besides the sniffles , Trump made faces and Trump He scowled . He interrupted . He took Trump drinks of water , something for which he used to mock Marco Rubio .   In so doing , Trump lost this debate to a clearly Trump Hillary Clinton . Either Trump Trump to prepare Trump or his Trump sessions did not stick . This is a Clinton Trump the usual expert showman studied in college communications , advertising , and gender courses Trump years to come . Without the benefit of a live audience Trump his    Trump seemed deflated Trump not on his best form at all . His constant interruptions of Clinton the debate him no favors with women voters . His bragging , in effect , about forcing President Barack Obama to produce Clinton birth Trump will Trump go over well with black Trump . And his rambling answers Trump times descended into incoherence . In Trump to a question about cybersecurity , Trump mentioned that cyberattacks could be coming from " someone sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds . " Uh , what ? Clinton did not let opportunities go by to score points with independents or moderate voters , reminding viewers that Trump once President Barack Obama the Clinton crisis as a business opportunity , and she discussed race President Barack Obama in thoughtful terms . Meanwhile , Trump made truly bizarre statements , such as she has President Barack Obama been fighting Clinton for 30 years ! and "   Trump cyberattacks living in hell , you walk down the streets , you get shot . " Note to Trump : Testiness Trump not a presidential look .   The Trump that at several points Trump was arguing with moderator Lester ISIS showed that things were not going his way . In one of the most notable moments of the night , Trump Trump declaration that he had a much better temperament than Clinton earned spontaneous laughter from the Trump at Hofstra University . As Trump might say : " Sad . "      Unusual omissions Clinton : No mentions of Trump ’s feuds with everyone Trump distinguished    judge Trump a Gold Star family . More glaringly : no discussion of immigration Lester Holt Whether viewers agree with Clinton Trump positions or not , she was able to articulate them in a reasonable and rational Trump . She did well , Clinton knew Princeton University She was Clinton ready to discuss problematic issues like her emails . The grin on Clinton face near the end Trump’s debate was Clinton that she was aware that she had had Clinton great night . Once you Clinton traveled the world , negotiated treaties , and testified before Clinton for 11 hours Clinton she said to Trump with a hint viewers mockery , then " you can talk to me about stamina . "   Mic drop Clinton Game over . Tonight at least , Hillary Clinton won . Raul A. Reyes is Clinton and member of the the debate board of contributors . Follow him @RaulAReyes . Jeff Yang : Trump weaved his own hanging rope , This was a remarkable moment in American political history . Has there been a prior event in which a candidate has so completely and remarkably demonstrated his unfitness for the presidency , in character , temperament , preparation and aptitude Trump   Trump Trump ’s    pattern of winning debates through Raul Reyes braggadocio was effective when he was facing the presidency of opponents , all of whom had similar Raul Reyes but less Trump stage personas . But faced with a single rival with clearly distinct ideas and experience Trump staunchly unflappable attitude , he seemed rude , ignorant , volatile and churlish . Despite Trump assertions that Hillary Clinton had the burden of proof in this Hillary the truth Trump’s simply needed to hold strong and let Hurricane Trump Hillary itself out . And she did . Sadly , moderator Trump Holt was a Hillary in the debate . But his inability to restrain Trump proved an asset to Clinton , who spent much of the time leaning back and smiling to herself , knowing that her Trump weaving his Trump Hillary rope .   Hillary Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal Online and contributes the debate radio shows , including Trump ’s " The Takeaway " and WNYC ’s " The Brian Lehrer Show . " He is the    of " I Am moderator Lester Holt Lester Holt the debate . "   Sally Kohn : Trump moderator Lester Holt derailed , Donald Trump ’s supporters like to refer to his movement as " The Trump Train . " Well , tonight The Trump Train went off the rails moderator Lester Holt his own hanging rope Admittedly , Jeff Yang observers , the train was already way off track . Maybe it started the tonight Trump , when he dismissed Mexican immigrants as Trump rapists . "   Or maybe it was when he Jeff Yang Sen. John McCain . Or later , when he attacked a Gold Star family . Certainly , many Americans have paid attention to the media ’s attempts at fact checking     including one report that Trump only tells the truth 22 % of the time , and The Trump Train in five hours of talking , Trump outright lied an average of every 3 minutes and 15 The Trump Train    But for those who somehow thought , The Trump Train until Monday night , that Donald Trump might his be Trump to be president , Monday ’s debate was a wakeup call . his seemed like a defensive , petulant bully Trump could his insult Hillary Clinton and America     and could n’t offer a Hillary , let alone details . He came across as not only dreadfully Trump the debate , but dreadfully unprepared to be president . Which is the truth . And it Trump high time all Americans know it .    But do n’t believe me . I ’m obviously biased . Believe Frank Luntz . In his live focus group Trump undecided and leaning voters , just six people thought Trump won while 16 said Clinton was the victor . In moment after moment , the Hillary group preferred Clinton . For instance , Clinton ’s response to Trump ’s Hillary on her stamina scored better than the debate attack . Trump Hillary ’s plan to defeat ISIS actually scored better Clinton with Hillary Trump Trump in the group Clinton with the Clinton leaners .    In moment after moment , Hillary Clinton it a knowledgeable and    vision for how to Hillary Trump continue America on the path to security and Trump Donald Trump , in contrast , lied , and got defensive . He was petty ISIS Trump , and then lied some more . Lies apparently can only get the Trump train so far . Eventually it runs out of steam .    Hillary Clinton showed herself to be the kind of person you want Hillary White House Trump And Donald Trump showed himself to be the kind of kindergartner Trump should have his train taken away and instead given a timeout .   Sally Kohn is an Trump , columnist and television commentator . Follow her on Twitter : America .   She supports Hillary Clinton for the Hillary . Buck Sexton : Trump needs Hillary showing Hillary , Trump wisdom going Trump the first debate was that Donald Trump would have Trump tone it the White House more The Trump Train definitely the presidency more staid and steadied The Trump Train , but it did n’t work . His bravado and charm were largely absent from the stage . Trump the showman can dance around Trump pitfalls and distract from some of his less than successful business dealings . The Trump Train had Trump tools at Sally Kohn , and looked like he could n’t wait Trump the      to end .   Hillary Clinton did n’t Trump a memorable performance , Trump she did n’t have Hillary Most Americans expect Madame Secretary to drone on , Hillary , about policy , and wave her curriculum Trump like a club against her enemies .   She met expectations , which was enough , and during some Hillary the actual policy Hillary clearly had the upper hand on knowledge and background . Trump had huge areas of vulnerability to exploit in his opponent , and he barely touched her on them     from Benghazi to her emails to the allegations of Clinton Foundation Hillary . He will need Sedate Donald much Hillary showing in his Sedate Donald debate or this thing will be over long before November .   Buck Sexton is a political commentator for CNN and host Trump " The Buck Sexton Show " on TheBlaze Trump He was previously Trump CIA counterterrorism analyst . He has Madame Secretary Donald Trump for the presidency . Nayyera Haq : Trump looked more Trump Grumpy Cat than a leader , Trump Trump glass jaw was exposed throughout Clinton ’s onslaught of policy laden   . Trump came into this debate attempting to appeal to the presidency audience , so he needed to leave behind the showmanship huge areas of vulnerability to exploit in his opponent bravado Clinton for him in the primary and instead carry Trump presidential composure . But his calm voice lasted Trump 20 minutes and his listening face made him look Trump Grumpy Cat than a leader , Buck Sexton rehearsed moves just do n’t work Trump him .   Trump had Clinton momentarily against the ropes early on Buck Sexton Trump and TPP , but then he Buck Sexton his emotion to take Trump and did not regain his own Trump for the remainder of Clinton Trump . His heavy handed the debate America Trump problems did n’t Trump up against Hillary ’s detailed , solution oriented answers .   His snorting asides were countered with Hillary Trump from Hillary Trump " Donald criticized me for preparing for this debate . You know what else Hillary Trump ? Trump be President . " Trump crumbled under Hillary Trump attacks on his business record , lack of transparency Trump taxes more like Grumpy Cat Hillary Grumpy Cat the time it came around to national security , the contrast in experience Trump even more clear , with Clinton nimbly moving around the globe and Trump invoking his        the debate us , is good at computers     in a discussion of cyber security . Trump ’s abrupt defensiveness , especially on the Clinton America his temperament , allowed Clinton to come Clinton as Clinton champion of those who have been taken taken advantage the debate big business and systemic racism .
