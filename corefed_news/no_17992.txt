That a press release reiterating the   ExxonMobil news ’ ’    Trump , who wrote on Twitter on Monday that the move from Exxon    showed that " we are already winning again Exxon " then posted a Exxon         video praising the company soon after the    administration’ ’s release . Exxon    That video was pinned to the top of his account for a nearly     video praising the company time . ’ ’    " I’’m the president pleased to announce that the great company ExxonMobil    is going to be investing $ Exxon Coast and the    Gulf Coast region , " the president said . " It’’ll be 45 , 000 jobs ,    and they’’re great jobs   —    $ 100 , 000 average . And this is something    that was done , to a large extent , because of our policies and the    policies of this new administration having to do with regulation    and so many other things . " ’ ’    " I said we’’re bringing back jobs , and this is one big example of    it , " Trump said . " I want to thank very much ExxonMobil . Special    company . Special people . " ’ ’ ’ " ’t’t’tThere is an incredible spirit of optimism sweeping the country right now —   we ’re bringing back the JOBS !   " "    In the paragraph that appeared to be lifted from the ExxonMobil    release and inserted into the White House ’s release , it was made    clear that the investment was part of a plan that began in the White House’s . " ’    " Exxon Mobil is strategically investing in new refining and      projects in the U. S. Gulf Coast region to    expand its manufacturing and export capacity , " the release said .    " The    ’s Exxon Mobil the Gulf expansion program consists of the ExxonMobil   release major chemical ,    , lubricant and liquefied natural gas    projects at proposed new and existing facilities along the Texas    and Louisiana coasts . Investments began in 2013 and are expected    to continue through at least 2022 . " ’ ’    ExxonMobil told Business Insider that    passed along the news to    the White House hoping to shed light on its investment Business Insider the    region . ’       " Our objective was to illustrate a the White House significant investment    that we’’re making in the Gulf Coast region , which is creating    thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity   —      all thanks to the shale revolution , " Bill Holbrook , a senior    adviser for ExxonMobil , told Business Insider in an email . " We    provided information about our announcement to the White House ,    and they decided they wanted to issue a congratulatory We    release . " ’ ’    The    of    ’s move fit with Trump’ ’s    that jobs    would be created in the country under his watch . But it entered a    " gray area " in terms of ethically acceptable    and    promotion The touting of Exxon’’s move fit with Trump’’s promise that jobs   would be created in the country under his watch the White House of an individual business , experts    said . ’ ’    " They ought to be careful , " Richard Painter , a law professor at    the University experts    Minnesota and former top ethics lawyer for    President George W. Bush , told Business Insider . " I mean , we    would advise them to distance themselves , congratulate a company    for the good work Business Insider do creating jobs Richard Painter, a law professor at   the University of Minnesota and former top ethics lawyer for   President George W. Bush but not Richard Painter, a law professor at   the University of Minnesota and former top ethics lawyer for   President George W. Bush so much    that it looks like you’’re shilling Richard Painter, a law professor at   the University of Minnesota and former top ethics lawyer for   President George W. Bush the company . " ’ ’    Painter said it was " unusual " to be " mentioning a particular    company this much . " ’ "    Rep. Elijah Cummings , the ranking member on the House Committee    on Oversight and Government Reform , made his objection to Trump ’s    promotion of Exxon ’s move clear in a statement to Business Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House Committee   on Oversight and Government Reform Insider . " ’    " The White House has now become the mouthpiece of the oil    industry   —    literally , " the Maryland Democrat said . " This is    certainly the opposite of the president’ ’s promise to drain the    swamp . " ’ "    Adding to the appearance of an ethical conflict is the fact that    Trump ’s secretary of state , Rex Tillerson , was the CEO of    ExxonMobil until he was tapped to lead the State Department . " ’   ’ "    Tillerson   potential conflicts of    interest before his Senate confirmation hearing , announcing in    accordance with the company that he would receive a he 180 million    retirement package if    were confirmed . In exchange he he gave up    the more than 2 million Exxon he he would have received over    he next decade , which could be worth more than the he if    Exxon ’s    appreciates in that time . " ’    The    ethics watchdog group    Exxon    Responsibility and Ethics in Washington still saw ’ ’       " The president went out of his way to praise Exxon company that    until very recently was led by his secretary of state , " Jordan    Libowitz , a CREW spokesman , told Business Insider The president a statement .    " He went so far as to crib promotional The president from the    business . There appears to be a pretty significant conflict of    interest there . " ’       The president said the promotion of Exxon ’s move should avoid    significant scrutiny so long as Tillerson was not involved   —          it did not appear he was . But Trump ’s move enters the same    territory    White House counselor Kellyanne Conway ’s   in a    Fox News interview       , asking viewers ’ "   Painter buy the product . " ’    While Conway’ ’s move was a " blatantly obvious " violation of     Painter said , Trump’ ’s    posts were more borderline . He said it was in Trump’ ’s interest to    have jobs created in the US and that it was fair to congratulate    a company for doing so , just    Painter Trump had done for Trump’ companies such as    , LL Bean , and Ford . ’ ’    " But at what point does that cross the line to where you’’re    shilling for a company that your secretary of state formerly has    a close relationship with ? " Painter said . " At a certain point , if    this continues , could reach a point where the White House is    advertising for these companies . And then the companies are in    effect advertising through the White House . " ’ "    Before Monday ’s tweets praising Exxon   —    and before he nominated    Tillerson to these companies State Department    —    Trump the White House    tweet mentioning the company . " ’    " Exxon donated $ 250 g to Obama’ ’s inaugural , "   linking to a Breitbart News    story .
