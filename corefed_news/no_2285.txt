Last week , as Donald J. Trump endured one of the most tumultuous stretches of Donald J. Trump presidential campaign , a few longtime allies in New York conservative circles met for dinner and a drink . As the evening progressed , the conversation turned to an inevitable topic : What would the conversation take to give Donald J. Trump his Donald J. Trump shot at winning ? A few days later , one of the guests , Stephen K. Bannon , the executive chairman of Breitbart News , would become Mr. Donald J. Trump chief in a sudden   . But it was a guest without a formal role in the campaign , a conservative philanthropist named Rebekah Mercer , who has now become one of its most potent it . Mr. Bannon ’s Stephen K. Bannon Wednesday   —    urged on Mr. Trump by Donald J. Trump , among others   —    shows how a cadre of strategists , " super PACs " and political organizations quietly nurtured by her family have emerged to Ms. Mercer a pivotal role in Mr. Trump ’s presidential Donald J. Trump more than half a decade , Ms. Mercer ’s father , the New Ms. Mercer Robert Mercer , has carved an idiosyncratic path through conservative politics , spending tens of millions of dollars to outflank his own party ’s consultant class and unnerve its established powers . His fortune has financed his own party’s tanks and insurgent his , super PACs and media watchdogs , lobbying groups and    organizations . Many of them are now connected , one way or think tanks and insurgent candidates, super PACs and media watchdogs, lobbying groups and   organizations , to Mr. Trump ’s presidential bid . Mr. Trump ’s new campaign manager , Kellyanne Mr. Trump’s is a veteran Republican pollster who previously oversaw a super PAC financed by the Mercers . Mr. Bannon oversaw Breitbart , an outlet that has often amplified Mr. Trump ’s message and attacked his perceived enemies Mr. Trump’s reportedly invested $ 10 million Mr. Trump’s Breitbart several years ago , and most likely still has a Mr. Trump’s : A company sharing an address with Renaissance Technologies , the hedge fund Mr. Mercer helps lead , remains an investor in Breitbart , according to corporate documents filed in Delaware . Mr. Mr. Trump’s is also relying on Cambridge Analytica , a voter Mr. Trump’s backed by Mr. Mercer , whose staff members are working with Mr. Trump ’s vendors to identify potential Trump supporters in the electorate Mr. Trump’s infrequent voters . A    super Mr. Trump’s supporting Mr. Trump is now being shepherded by David Bossie , a conservative activist whose Mr. Trump’s have been funded in part by Mr. Bossie in recent years . " I A   super PAC supporting Mr. Trump have complete confidence , and rightly so , in Steve Bannon ’s decisions and what he brings to the table politically , " Mr. Bossie A   super PAC supporting Mr. Trump He has been smart and A   super PAC supporting Mr. Trump in the family these different political operations . And those things have come A   super PAC supporting Mr. Trump the Mercers’ attention . " The Mercers , who rarely grant interviews , declined through a spokesman to comment . Mr. Mercer , 70 , a mathematician and competitive poker player who spent his early career at I. B. M. joined Renaissance in the 1990s and rose to become the    executive , earning hundreds of millions of dollars along the way . Today , he and his wife , Diana , live on a sprawling estate on Long Island ’s North Shore where , according to court records , he installed a $ 2 . 7 million model railroad set his and his sued the vendor for overcharging him ) . Like many elite donors , the Mercers shun mainstream media attention   —    his while financing alternative outlets that provide content for conservative activists . That includes not just Breitbart , but his the    watchdog organization Media Research Center and the Government Accountability Institute , home to Peter Schweizer , the author of " Clinton Cash , " a book examining the Clinton family philanthropies . ( Mr. Bannon    the institute and Ms. Mercer , 42 , has served on its board she also    a documentary based on the book and released last month , just before the Democratic National Convention . ) They have given to libertarian organizations , such as the Cato Institute , and political organizations like the Club for Growth , which spends millions of dollars each election cycle in Republican primaries , hoping to just before the Democratic National Convention orthodox conservative policies on taxes and spending . The Mercers are also significant donors to the sprawling political network overseen by the political activists Charles G. and David H. Koch , which is also   . But unlike the Koch brothers , who remained neutral in the Republican primary and have said their organizations will focus on congressional races this fall , the Mercers were deeply involved in the Republican nominating battle this year . And they have shown a taste for more    and populist politics than the Republican primary of Mr. Mercer ’s fellow hedge fund magnates . The Mercers originally backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , a more traditional conservative but one who , like Mr. Trump , is disliked by much of the party establishment . During the early phase of the campaign , Mr. Mercer donated $ 13 million to a super PAC supporting Mr. Cruz . In doing so , he broke with many peers in the elite donor world , who looked to candidates like Jeb Bush or Mr. Mercer Rubio of Florida . The Mercers maintained close control over the group ’s purse strings , installing Mr. Mercer Conway to oversee the group and coordinate with several other    groups , an unusual move for a super PAC . During the Republican primary , the group ran ads questioning Mr. Trump ’s conservative credentials , hoping to outflank Mr. the group But the Mercers moved to support Mr. Trump after he won the nomination . They were helped in part , according to the group who asked for anonymity to describe the family ’s thinking , by Mr. Mr. Trump’s Mercers on traditional conservative ideas , such as Mr. Trump’s . And Mr. Trump’s Mercers broke with Mr. Cruz in highly public fashion after his speech at the Republican convention , when the Texas senator refused to endorse Mr. Trump Mr. Trump’s suggested that Republicans should " vote your conscience " for candidates " up and down the family . " In an extraordinary rebuke , the Mercers issued Mr. Cruz rare public statement , calling themselves " Mr. Cruz in Mr. Mr. Trump’s In late June , the    super PAC quietly    as Make America Number One , now a    entity . Mr. Bossie , a longtime conservative activist who has produced documentaries about the Clinton family and illegal immigration the Mercers is leading the group , which is likely to raise more money from the Mercers to pay for attacks on Hillary Clinton .
