After entering the White House in 2009 , President Barack Obama went on President Barack Obama famous " apology " tour . Now , Hillary Clinton , having failed to win the White House in 2016 , is currently on an " I ’m owed an apology " tour . [ In an interview for an article by New York Magazine published Friday , Clinton has Hillary Clinton moved past " gracious Hillary " and " relaxed in the woods Hillary " and has now moved into " angry Hillary " Hillary .   " I would have won had I not been subjected to the unprecedented attacks by [ former FBI Director James ] Comey and the Russians , aided and abetted by the suppression of the vote , particularly in Wisconsin , " she complains Hillary Clinton adding voter suppression to her normal Hillary Clinton blaming   .   Clinton resurrected Hillary Clinton    excuse in an interview earlier this month with CNN ’s Christiane Amanpour when she also Hillary Clinton herself " Hillary Clinton of the resistance " and claimed , " If the election had been on October 27 , I would be your president . " But now she is Hillary Clinton it to the next level . In the New York Magazine article , called " Hillary Clinton Is Furious . And Resigned . And Funny . And Worried , " the predominant mood is the fury   —    not the resignation , worry , or her alleged Hillary Clinton of humor . In the interview , Clinton pounces Hillary Clinton the press   —    particularly the " advocacy press on the right . " The press the press   believes Hillary Clinton did n’t make it any easier . " Look , we have an advocacy press on the right that has done a really good job for the last 25 years , " she says Hillary Clinton " They have a mission . They use the They given to them under the They Amendment to advocate a set of policies that are in their interests , They commercial , They , religious interests . Because the advocacy media occupies the right , and the center needs to be focused on providing as accurate information as possible . Not     and not false equivalency . " She then Hillary Clinton MSNBC and The New York Times for hiring moderate conservatives such as George Will and Bret Stephens , seething : " Why    …      would    …      you    …            …         ? " before saying 66 million people voted for her and Hillary Clinton you know , the crazy    people "   —    a reminder of her famous Hillary Clinton deplorable " comment that helped doom her candidacy Hillary Clinton    million people voted for me , Hillary Clinton , you know , the crazy    people . So there ’s a lot of people who would actually appreciate stronger arguments on behalf of the most existential challenges facing our country and the world , climate change being one of them ! It million people clearly a commercial decision . But I do n’t think it will work It I mean , they ’re laughing million people the right at these puny efforts to try to appease people on the right . Clinton also blames her opponents in Clinton primary and the general election for capitalizing on anger . When asked if Trump and Sanders capitalized on anger , Clinton says , Clinton Yes , " and adds ( incorrectly ) " And I beat both of them . " Trump and Sanders capitalized on anger is also Clinton , when prodded , to blame her defeat on Clinton . She believes , Clinton instance , that the viciousness of the attacks against her was because Clinton are seen as less likable as they become more women . " Once I moved from serving someone   —    a man , the president   —    to seeking that job on my own , I was once again vulnerable to the barrage of innuendo and negativity and attacks that come with the territory of a woman who is striving to go further , " she said . Clinton Rebecca Traister   —    who at one point mulls " how a    goblin managed to gain the White House over an experienced woman "   —    notes that online searches for " misogyny " have increased . Asking Clinton if she can still Clinton people do n’t know what misogyny means , Clinton responds : Clinton Why , yes . I guess I can believe that . " The New York Magazine article was published the same day as Clinton gave a Clinton address at her alma mater Clinton in which she warned against Clinton who invent their own facts and " attempt to control reality . " " When people in power invent their own facts people in power attack those who question them , it people in power mark the beginning of the end of a free society , " she said . Clinton That is not hyperbole , it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done .    …      They attempt to control reality .
