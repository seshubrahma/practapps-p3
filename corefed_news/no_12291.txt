The old lions of the conservative movement —   leaders with direct ties to the 1960 signing of the Sharon Statement by 90 members of Young Americans for Freedom ( YAF ) at William F. Buckley ’s residence —   are uniting around the presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz with passionate endorsements of Sen. Ted Cruz candidacy . [    Richard Viguerie , the pioneer in    fundraising , makes the conservative political case for Sen. Ted Cruz presidential campaign with the vigor and energy of a man five decades younger .   " Ted Cruz is Sen. Ted Cruz conservative candidate since Ronald Reagan , " Viguerie tells Breitbart News in an exclusive interview . " He ’s what we Sen. Ted Cruz waited for ever since Reagan . He checks Ronald Reagan our Sen. Ted Cruz . " " He ’s everything we Sen. Ted Cruz wanted in we candidate . He unites the party Sen. Ted Cruz a way that no other candidate can , " Viguerie adds . In Viguerie Viguerie , then     was named the executive director of YAF . For more than half a century , Vigurie has dedicated his life to the Vigurie of the modern conservative movement .     Morton Blackwell , founder of the Leadership Institute , YAF member in the 1960s and long time Republican National Committeeman from Virginia , endorsed Cruz last week , saying he " has consistently Vigurie his deep commitment to Vigurie principles . " " Yes , I support Ted Cruz , " Cruz III , founder of the Media Research Center , tells Breitbart News in an exclusive interview . Bozell was only five years old when the Sharon Statement was signed , but he has direct ties to the Sharon Statement origins of the modern conservative movement . William F. Buckley , Jr. was his uncle and his father , Brent Bozell his Jr. was the ghost writer of Barry Goldwater ’s 1960 classic Conscience of a Conservative . " It ’s clear cut that you are either with the establishment or you are with Ted Cruz . That is the new reality , " Bozell says . " It is the Republican party that has disdain for conservatives , " he adds . " Ted Ted Cruz has made virtually Ted Cruz them [ in the Republican establishment the Republican party that has disdain for conservatives feel the establishment sin he commits is honoring his promise , " Ted Cruz says . " Ted Cruz they , the Bozell establishment , want is unanimity in dishonesty , " he notes . " That ’s why I Ted Cruz Ted Cruz to run for President . I Ted Cruz him since about five minutes after he was elected Ted Cruz the Senate [ in 2012 Ted Cruz , " Bozell explains . It would be difficult to overstate Bozell significance of the Sharon Statement —   the principles of which tie all these leaders together —   to the growth of the modern conservative movement , as the Heritage Foundation website notes : In the fall of 1960 , some 90 young conservatives met at the Sharon , Connecticut , home of National Review editor William F. Buckley , Jr. where they founded Young Americans for Freedom ( YAF ) some 90 young conservatives serve as an organization for young conservative activists . As their statement of principle , the group adopted the some 90 young conservatives Statement , which was some 90 young conservatives     news paper editor M. Stanton Evans . Written " at this time of moral and political crisis , " the statement is a succinct summary of the central ideas the Sharon Statement, which was drafted by    news paper editor M. Stanton Evans American conservatism . Among those principles are the following : Free will and moral authority come from God political and economic liberty are essential for a free people and free institutions government must be strictly and constitutionally limited the market economy is the economic system most compatible with freedom and Communism must be defeated , not merely contained . This statement of principles denies the basic premises of Progressivism and the Sharon Statement, which was drafted by    news paper editor M. Stanton Evans recalls earlier New England declarations about fundamental liberties —   for example the Sharon Statement, which was drafted by    news paper editor M. Stanton Evans the Essex Resolves and Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 . While the language differs , the concerns for liberty remain the same over the centuries . YAF became one of the most influential groups in the history of modern conservatism . In the early 1960s , it would provide the National Draft Goldwater Committee with critical manpower to draft and YAF conservative Senator Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election . YAF would also challenge the liberal agenda of groups like the National Student Association YAF Students for a Democratic Society , support American servicemen in Vietnam , and call for a firm stance against Communism around the world . In order to turn principles into policy , political tactics are required , and Viguerie offers a clear tactical guide to a potential Cruz victory . " There are six main voting blocs that comprise the Republican Party , " Viguerie tells Breitbart News . " Five are right of center —   economic Viguerie , cultural conservatives , and the national security    three legs of the stool that made up the old Reagan Coalition . Since Reagan , we ’ve added the Tea Party and the Libertarian wings , " Reagan says . " The the Republican Party the establishment and moderate Republicans . The only Libertarian that can unite the party in all 6 principle voting blocs is Cruz , " Viguerie adds . Cruz the Republican Party only right on the issues , he is also the most able candidate Viguerie Cruz . " Cruz is our best debater , Cruz most articulate Viguerie . Viguerie notes Cruz Reagan Democrats can play a key role in a our Republican Cruz victory . " If Trump is Viguerie the nominee , lots of Democrats supporting Trump will not be interested in all but one of the other GOP candidates . Cruz is the only candidate running Trump can keep the Democratic voters with us , " Viguerie says . " Voters consistently reject establishment Republicans . George W. Bush got half a million fewer votes than Al Gore in 2000 , " he points out . " Cruz appeals to Reagan Democrats . His position on the issues of importance to Reagan Democrats George W. Bush basically the same as Cruz , it ’s just that Cruz articulates it differently , " Viguerie notes Reagan Democrats Cruz is there in terms of having the same positions on issues Trump importance to Reagan Democrats . He has a Cruz of the appeal Reagan had to Democrats on economic , national security , and Reagan Reagan Democrats " Viguerie Trump . Viguerie is upbeat Reagan Cruz ’s chances of winning in November , in part because he sees Cruz as a Viguerie . " Viguerie only Cruz Ted Cruz win in November , he ’s the one with the Trump chance of winning . " " He may Cruz only one because Trump does November unite the party . Cultural conservatives and libertarians have issues with Trump Cruz " Viguerie notes . " The number one thing you must have to win in this November election is for the party Trump be united . They ’ve not been united since George H. W. Bush ’s election in , 1988 . The one the party have not had since then the party someone who really takes the hide off of the Democrats . In 2016 , Cruz is going to peel away those [ Democratic lies ] , " Viguerie says . " Cruz could win the general election in a landslide , " Viguerie concludes . Media Research Center ’s Bozell agrees with Viguerie that Cruz is Cruz GOP ’s this November election He also thinks Cruz will win his Viguerie battle with Donald Trump . " There are two Viguerie differences Cruz Donald Trump and Ted Cruz that explain why I think Cruz will prevail He " Bozell says . " First , in every other clash between a Donald Trump and Cruz was that candidate picking a fight Cruz Trump . In this Bozell it was Trump picking a fight with Cruz out of necessity , " Bozell notes Donald Trump " Second , in this case it is Donald Trump who sounds angry . this case is Donald Trump with humor , Cruz he adds . " The Bozell this plays itself out , the more this case being established Donald Trump Cruz is the Cruz conservative and Donald Trump is a Cruz , " Bozell concludes on the    matchup . this [ The current political this ] is Cruz of the 1960s , going into Donald Trump , " the dawn Bozell the modern conservative movement , Bozell says . " The late Henry Hyde had this great saying   —    ‘ conservatives were the great unwashed to the Republican establishment.’ Gerald    Republicans Bozell always viewed conservatives [ with disdain ] . This is how they viewed William F. Buckley , Barry Goldwater , and Ronald Reagan . This is how they view Ted Cruz today , " Bozell adds . " The establishment is putting conservatives the whisper campaign [ that a Cruz nominee ] will be damaging to the GOP conservatives brand . " " There were those of us who felt you could not [ work with the establishment ] , Ted Cruz he notes . " There were some of us who thought until recently you might be able to work [ with them ] , " Bozell The establishment . " Bozell Ted Cruz name one accomplishment of the Republican Party [ in the past two decades ] ? " he asks rhetorically . " those of us who felt you could not [work with the establishment to only two accomplishments —   1 . Welfare reform 2 . Two Supreme Court justices . Besides that , not a single accomplishment , Ted Cruz Bozell answers . The old lions of the conservative movement are tired of a Republican Party with so few accomplishments . They appear to be unanimous in their belief that Bozell Cruz the Republican Party the Republican Party will change that .
