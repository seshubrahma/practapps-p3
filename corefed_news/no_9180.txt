Hillary Clinton suggested politicians should have " both a public and a private position , " according to an email disclosing an excerpt of a speech from April 4 , 2013 to the National    Council . [ WikiLeaks released 2 , 050 emails from Hillary Clinton ’s campaign chairman John Podesta on Friday , revealing excerpts from several of Hillary Clinton ’s paid speeches .   " But if everybody ’s watching , you know , all of the back room discussions and the deals , you know , then people get a little nervous , to say the least . So , you need both a public and a private position , " Hillary Clinton allegedly stated in the April 24 , 2013 speech , according to WikiLeaks . Hillary Clinton continued : You just have to sort of figure out how to   —    getting back to that word , " balance "   —    how to balance the public and the private efforts that are necessary to be successful , politically , and that ’s not just a comment about today . That , I think , has probably been true for all of our history , and if you saw the Spielberg movie , Lincoln , and how he was maneuvering and working to get the 13th Amendment passed , and he called one of my favorite predecessors , Secretary Seward , who had been the governor and senator from New York , ran against Lincoln for president , and he told Seward , I need your help to get this done . And Seward called some of he lobbyist friends who knew how to make a deal , and some of his lobbyist friends who knew how to make a deal just kept going at a deal . I mean , politics is like sausage being made . politics is unsavory , and politics always has been that way , but we usually end up where we need to be . But if everybody ’s watching , you know , all of the back room discussions and the deals , you know , then people get a little nervous , to say the least . So , you need both a public and a private position . And finally , I think   —    I believe in    decision making . I want to know what the facts are . I mean , the facts ’s like when you guys go into some kind of a deal , you know , are you going to do that development or not , are you going to do that renovation or not , you know , you look at the numbers . You try to figure out what ’s going to work and what ’s not going to work . This is the first release of more than 50 , 000 of Podesta ’s emails , which WikiLeaks obtained .
