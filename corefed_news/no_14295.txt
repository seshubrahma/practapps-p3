Flosa , who was pregnant , would remain in Iraq .   As Dilbireen recovered in the United States , Ajeel returned Dilbireen Iraq for the baby ’s birth and then planned Iraq accompany Flosa and their newborn to the United States so the family Flosa, who was pregnant reunite for the United States Dilbireen ’s surgeries .
