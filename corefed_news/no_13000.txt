On this weekend ’s broadcast of " Fox News Sunday , "    Donald Trump ’s incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus denied there was " open warfare " between Donald Trump advisers and loyalists over the possibility of   former Gov. Mitt Romney ( ) being tapped as secretary of state .   Reince Priebus said , " There are a lot of opinions as far as this topic and many other cabinet positions , but I think what    Donald Trump has said is that , as Donald Trump said the entire campaign , Donald Trump ’s going to hire the best people possible . Donald Trump ’s going through this process , Donald Trump ’s interviewed Governor Romney , Donald Trump ’s talked to the mayor , Donald Trump ’s talked to others like General Kelly . Donald Trump ’s going to be talking to others next week . Donald Trump ’s going to make the best decision for the American people . " " It ’s not about warfare , " Donald Trump continued . " Yes , there is a lot of   opinion about this . this is sort of a team of rivals context if Donald Trump does go with governor Romney , but that should tell Americans where    Trump ’s head is , which is a place that will put the best possible place together for all Americans , whatever your religion , whatever your opinion is . Donald Trump wants to move forward looking through the windshield and not the rear view mirror , and that ’s where the   ’s head is at . And I think it ’s a great place for Americans .
