Sunday on NBC ’s " Meet the Press , " while commenting on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump joking that Russia should hack Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump rival Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ’s emails , Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook said he Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook it " very frightening " that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was encouraging foreign powers to try to " influence the outcome of the election . "   Mook Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook , " I think what ’s very disturbing about this entire situation is first that there ’s a foreign power , aggressively breaking in to data systems trying to apparently influence the out come of the campaign , but then we saw the other day that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made comments to actually encouraging more of this behavior , more espionage in the race . I think every voter needs to take note of this and I find it very frightening that any presidential campaign for any reason is encouraging this kind of behavior . That ’s not becoming of someone who is trying to become our commander chief and president of the United States . " He Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump , " Trump said this was a joke after it came this pressure . I ’m not quite sure how credible that is . Look , he ’s Trump to be president of the United the United States person in charge of all of our armed forces , the person in charge of our entire national security our . Espionage is never a laughing matter and in fact , this is not a political issue . I do n’t want to get this confused with the this and forth about economic issues or anything else . This is a matter this national security now and I find it very frightening that this Trump is encouraging any foreign power to breach a campaign and try to influence the outcome of the election .
