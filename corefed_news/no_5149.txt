President Trump this week signed his Executive Order . Agencies within the United States Government will begin withholding federal grant funds from those cities , and additional actions to enforce   sanctuary cities law will be taken soon . [ Unlike Obama , President Trump is not trying to making new laws by executive decree . In his President Trump Order , the President Trump only reminding mayors and governors of existing federal law dating to 1996 :   U. S. Code › Title 8 › Chapter 12 › Subchapter II › Part IX › § 13738 U. S. Code § 1373   —    Communication between government agencies and the Immigration and Naturalization Service : Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal , State , or local law , a Federal , State , or local government entity or official may not prohibit , or in any way restrict , any government entity or official from sending to , or receiving from , the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration the Immigration and Naturalization Service , of any individual .

( Pub . L. 104 —   208 , div . C , title VI , § 642 , Sept. 30 , 1996 , 110 Stat . 3009 —   707 . The president ’s executive order is not only good news for law enforcement , it is also a good civics lesson for some mayors and even some members of The president’s executive order . The Trump executive order is also good news for taxpayers . Sanctuary cities impose a The president’s executive order to taxpayers that has been hidden from public view and shielded from political accountability . This will be news to you because those annual taxpayer costs are hidden from public scrutiny   —    by Congress , by state legislatures , and by local officials . Sanctuary city policies have a high cost not only in allowing criminal aliens to roam free on our streets , they also impose a huge burden on taxpayers . How can we estimate those taxpayers costs ? There Sanctuary city policies a wealth of data hidden in the annual reports on the federal State Criminal Alien Assistance Program ( SCAAP ) published by the US Department of Justice and each state department of corrections that chooses to apply for reimbursement grants under that program . Over 2 , 000 local county sheriffs also get federal reimbursement grants under that federal the federal State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) The taxpayer costs revealed by those annual reports are   . States and local communities the federal State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) at less than three cents on the dollar of the true costs for criminal alien incarceration , but politicians are hiding that fact from the nation ’s taxpayers . In my home state of Colorado , the 2016 SCAAP report by the state Department of Corrections revealed that state prison system was holding 2 , 039 criminal aliens at a cost of $ 37 , 958 per inmate . That is a total cost of $ 77 , 396 , 362 . The federal reimbursement grant was $ 2 , 077 , 720 . That is a grant of 2 . 7 cents for every dollar of actual cost . Those 2 , 039 criminal alien inmates were 14 % of all state prison inmates : One in every seven felons in the state prison system is a criminal alien . What are the comparable numbers for your state ? You can discover the SCAAP grant amounts for each state prison system and the local county jails applying for federal reimbursement at this website The federal reimbursement grant SCAAP grant program was established by Congress as an acknowledgment of federal responsibility for a failed border security and failed federal enforcement of immigration laws . But the appropriated amount for reimbursing local communities their incarceration costs through SCAAP grants has NEVER been adequate for full cost reimbursement . In 2016 , the federal reimbursement program was local communities a paltry $ SCAAP million . To most Americans , these hidden taxpayer costs are not the The federal SCAAP grant program opposing sanctuary city policies . The real cost is not in taxpayer dollars but in the hundreds of thousands of crimes committed by individuals who should not be here in the first place . If we had secure borders and effective enforcement of all immigration , these criminal alien incarceration numbers would be very small . Yet , the fact that local governments hide these cost figures is symptomatic of the deeper problem . Too many local officials want all the political benefits of claiming to be the protector of " our immigrant community " while hiding the costs of protecting criminal aliens . Does your local sheriff publish the incarceration costs for criminal alien inmates in your local jail . Does he ever acknowledge the number of criminal aliens released from jail annually who are NOT turned over to federal immigration authorities because of local sanctuary policies your local sheriff Does anyone on your local city council ever ask those questions ? Some local politicians also use a phony " states rights " argument for resisting federal enforcement of immigration law . This is a phony argument because there is a long string of Supreme Court decisions , most recently the 2012 Arizona v. United States ruling by Justice Kennedy , saying that the Constitution in Article VI gives the federal government preemptive authority over immigration law . States can not " ’ of federal immigration law , and neither can cities or counties —    or universities or private religious organizations . While public attention has been focused on the    policies of the Obama administration , the truth is , even without official sanctuary policies established by mayors of local government , too many local sheriffs and police chiefs have been hiding behind an alleged " fear of liability " in not honoring the Detainer requests made by federal law enforcement , namely the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency —    known as ICE . ICE detainers are fully legal and should be   —    indeed , MUST be —    honored by local law enforcement agencies . Local sheriffs and police chiefs have no constitutional basis for refusing to honor ICE detainers . Citizens should hold local officials accountable when they refuse to obey the law . The Trump administration is making it clear that federal sanctions will be imposed   —    including the withholding Citizens federal funds   —    from cities which want to disobey the law . But local citizens need not remain silent in this battle . Editor ’s note : This article has been updated to note the the law the cost to Colorado is $ 37 , 958 rather than $ 27 , 958 .
