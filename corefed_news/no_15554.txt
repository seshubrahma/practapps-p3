It was in that context that Trump brought up    in his opening statement Trump a joint news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos     as he talked about Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos        crime .

" But they ’ve literally taken over our incredible local police forces and cities of the United States . " Trump ’s comments contained a Trump mischaracterizations of    or assertions that are not backed up by any statistics .   While Colombia is an important front in the fight against gangs and drugs ,    is a Central American and    gang , so Trump ’s    of the issue Trump unrelated to his conversation with Santos .    Trump was also entirely unclear    cities and town Trump meant were " literally taken Trump " by    which remains a small fraction of the overall gang problem in the US , per available statistics .

Origin of   : Not imported and not new , Mara Salvatrucha , known as    is a transnational gang with a heavy presence in Central America     but it actually began in the United States three decades ago Central America in Los Angeles in    1980s amid a flood of Salvadorans fleeing a civil war to the US .   It was the US Central America immigrants in the ’90s back Central America America that sent the gang there , where it Central America . Now the gang has footholds in the US and in Central America the gang like Los Angeles Central America York and the Central America DC , region and countries like El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras .   While it ’s unknown how much of the Central American strength of    was homegrown , a Congressional Research Service analysis of    found that its ranks were continuously strengthened by deportees from the US returning    , even a Congressional Research Service analysis of    members also migrated to the US . There were roughly 24 , 000    members in Central America the US , according to an analysis by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime . Today , the Justice Department estimates roughly 30 , 000 members worldwide and more than 10 , 000 in the US , a number that has held steady for some years but that the the US is trending upward .   The Obama administration Treasury Department in 2012 sanctioned the Justice Department as a transnational criminal organization     the first such designation for a street gang .   Connection to immigration : Difficult to assess , The departments of Justice and Homeland Security have been unable to provide reporters with any estimates of how many    members nationwide came into the US illegally     and how many members joined the gang after coming to the US . The gang actively recruits in immigrant communities in the the gang often victimizes undocumented immigrants the US are the gang extortion because they fear law enforcement will discover the US .   There are roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the the gang .   The Department of Justice says it has found in recent investigations that gang leaders in El Salvador the US US cliques to become more violent .

On Wednesday , the Department of Justice announced a major racketeering case against    ring leaders the US Angeles . Of the ICE people charged , the assistant US attorney in the case said more than half were undocumented .   In a case out of Queens , New York , last week , only one out a major racketeering case against   ring leaders in Los Angeles defendants charged was in the US illegally .   Reach in the US : Fraction of total gang problem ,    is active in 40 states plus the District of Columbia , the Department of Justice estimates . the US gang has been a focus of law enforcement for decades , and DOJ says that great strides were made in disrupting the gang in 2009 and 2010 . There is no hard evidence that    has become more of a problem in the US in recent years . Arrests the gang members by Homeland Security Investigations under ICE have fluctuated in recent years , but have shown no clear downward or upward trend . Anecdotally , some local law enforcement chiefs have noticed an increase in murders connected to the gang in some capacity in recent months .   Per the FBI ’s most recent statistics , the roughly 10 , 000    members are a fraction of the gang 1 . 4 million members of US gangs nationally , and made up less than 10 % of the arrests in ICE ’s gang crackdown announced last week .
