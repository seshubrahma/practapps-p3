’   ’ "    RICHMOND , Va. ( AP )   —    Virginia ’s    lieutenant    governor won the Democratic nomination in the closely watched    race for governor Tuesday , defeating a more liberal insurgent    challenger in a contest to be one of the party ’s      against President Donald Trump . " ’    Ralph Northam defeated former U. S. Rep. Tom Perriello , who ran as    an unapologetic liberal crusader supported by prominent national    Democrats like Sens . Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as the    best candidate to take on President Donald Trump . ’ ’    The    Republican primary remains too close to call . The    general election is expected to be an early referendum on the    president and a preview of what the 2018 midterm elections will    look like . ’ "    Northam , a    pediatric neurologist , won running as a    pragmatist with state ’s Democratic establishment ’s firm support .       has also vowed to fight Trump , but with pledges to work with    state Republican lawmakers on issues like a tax overhaul . " "    Virginia is one of only two states electing new governors this    year , and the    contest is likely to draw intense    national scrutiny for signs of how voters are reacting to Trump ’s    first year in office . " ’    Frank Von Richter said Frank Von Richter voted for Northam because Frank Von Richter likes that    the lieutenant governor is more " middle of the road " than    Perriello and thinks the lieutenant governor will work better with a      General Assembly .

" ’    Northam had been essentially campaigning for years , making key    contacts with influential power brokers like prominent      politicians and religious leaders , and building    up a large cash advantage that let him outspend Perriello on TV    advertising in the closing weeks of the race . ’ "    Northam’s campaign ran a more traditional campaign focused    heavily on his biography   —    rural upbringing , Army veteran ,    pediatric neurologist   —    as well as his his from key    progressive groups that make up the Democratic base like teachers    and    groups .
