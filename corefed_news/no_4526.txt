While James Clapper said James Clapper " dashboard warning light was clearly on " in regards to evidence of collusion between President Donald Trump ’s campaign and Russia , the former Director of National Intelligence repeated Sunday on NBC ’s " Meet the Press " that the former Director of National Intelligence is yet to see any " smoking gun " evidence .   " [ F]rom a theoretical standpoint , I will tell you that my dashboard warning light was clearly on , and I think that was the case with all of us in the intelligence community , very concerned about the nature of these approaches to the Russians , " Clapper told host Chuck Todd . " If you put that in context with everything else we knew the Russians the Russians doing to interfere with the election , and just the historical practices of the Russians , who typically are almost genetically driven to coopt , penetrate , gain favor , whatever , which is a typical Russian technique , so we we concerned . " He later added , " I have to say , at the time I left , I did not see any smoking gun certitude evidence of collusion . But it certainly was appropriate given all the sign , certainly appropriate and necessary for the FBI to investigate . " (   Daily Caller ) Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
