In presidential politics , everyone is on the lookout for everyone and an army of analysts is eager to declare everyone : turning points . It ’s the moment when a single image or phrase or blunder could change the trajectory of the campaign . But when is a turning point really a turning point ? Where   —    if at all   —    does Hillary Clinton ’s " basket of deplorables " remark or Hillary Clinton’s health scare at the Sept. 11 memorial land on that scale ? What about Donald J. Trump ’s widely denounced comments about Mexicans and Muslims ? In the latest episode of The    my colleagues on the campaign team answer those questions by talking about the turning points the campaign team ’ve experienced in this race   —    not always the big ,    kind , but frequently the smaller , subtler ,    ones that nevertheless signaled a shift in the political terrain . Our guests are Patrick Healy , a national political reporter Amy Chozick , who covers the Clinton campaign Ashley Parker , who reports on Donald J. Trump Maggie Haberman , who has written about both candidates Robert Draper , a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine and Jim Rutenberg , the media columnist at The Times . And we look back at what many regard as the biggest turning point of the last presidential campaign , in 2012 , to explore whether it was as consequential as everyone thought at the time .
