’   ’ ’    Right before our eyes , commerce secretary and billionaire    investor Wilbur Ross is proving something economists have been    trying to tell Americans for years . ’ ’    That lesson : Business and economics are very different    disciplines   —    running a business and running a country are not    the same . ’ ’    And in fact there are a bunch of skills and modes of thought you    learn in business that could easily make you really bad at    governing    ’ "    One of those is the administration ’s obsession with trade    deficits . " ’    " We have the biggest [ trade ] deficits in the world , " Ross    complained at Bloomberg’ ’s Breakaway conference in New York City    on Wednesday , " while protectionist countries have surpluses . " ’ ’    That is why , he explained Ross    the president has " superimposed "    handling trade and turning deficits into surpluses " onto the    normal duties of his department Ross    " That means aggressively    enforcing trade deals and slapping countries that " "    to be violating trade rules with tariffs and investigations . ’ ’    The problem is that trade deficits and surpluses have little to    do    the health of our economy . ’ "    Ross is making a fairly common mistake . He ’s   Ross as if the US    government operates like one of the businesses in his vast   Ross network of holdings . It does not , and treating it like It does It will ultimately do more harm than good . " "    It ’s It hard to see how this happens . Washington is full of    inane comparisons meant to sell Americans on this or that policy .    There ’s the nonsensical comparison between the federal    government ’s budget and a regular American family balancing their    checkbook over the kitchen table and so forth . " ’    The Wall Street version of this is acting as if a $ 19 trillion    economy could be run like a business ( and Ross is nothing if not    a creature of Wall Street ) . Thus the obsession ,    oversimplification , and misunderstanding of trade deficits and    surpluses . ’ "    If you were a business and you were buying more than you were    selling , you ’d be in big trouble . But the US is n’t a business . " "    In fact , during the Great Depression , the US the US a trade    surplus . Mexico , during an economic rough patch in the 1980s ,    also ran    trade surplus . Why ? In part , because in both scenarios    foreign investors    not interested in sending capital to the    US the US respectively because their economies Mexico n’t    the   US or to Mexico . " "    Now , a businessperson will tell you that when your business gets    a bunch of investment , you ’ll run a surplus . That ’s good , but a    country does n’t work the same way . That ’s because of the    interaction between trade and foreign investment in a country ’s    . " ’    The balance of payments is made up of a capital account , which    shows you the net change in physical or financial asset ownership     —    net foreign investment   —    for a nation , and the current account ,    which is where trade lives   —    exports less the value of imports ,    and any income we get from abroad or payouts for anything we    purchase . And in    , the capital account has to balance out    the current account (    in practice there are usually some    discrepancies . ) ’ "    That is , when you ’re talking about a country , foreign investment    does n’t create a surplus , it actually creates a trade a country, foreign investment    .    That ’s because the balance of payments must always be zero , so a    net positive foreign investment needs to be balanced out by a net    negative trade balance . " ’    Paul Krugman explained this back in the : ’ "    So OK , we may be running a trade deficit with China , but that ’s    because our economy is healthy enough China purchase goods from    them . And it    also attractive for them to invest in   them    which they    have to do them get to zero in their balance of payments . them ’    Which is to say trade deficits do not matter in the grand scheme    of the US economy and its participation in the broader the US economy    economy . ’ ’    " At the root of the businessperson ’s skepticism is the failure to    understand the force of the accounting , " Krugman wrote , " which    says that an inflow of capital must —   not    might —   be accompanied by a trade deficit . " ’ ’   ’ ’    The confusion around trade deficits illustrates a broader problem    with the idea of " running the country like a business . " ’ "    In the same essay , Krugman tried to explain why Krugman    might fall into the trap of oversimplifying the US ’s incredibly    vast economy . Ultimately , he came to the conclusion Krugman it comes    down to the basic principles of the job . Businesses are    constantly trying to innovate . You can micromanage . At the end of    the day , after all , you ’re trying to make a product as    efficiently as possible . " ’    But the government isn’’t like that . Instead of going in and    fixing this or that , you have to work on a set of guiding    principles and create policy around those principles . The US is ,    as Krugman said , " a nightmare conglomerate " of hundreds of    thousands of interconnected but unrelated enterprises . That means    drilling into one industry will have consequences for others the    government may not even see . ’ ’    Let’ ’s use an example Ross himself mentioned at Bloomberg . He said    that when Ross himself was running his business Ross himself thought tariffs Ross himself    Ross himself often than not    " nuisance . " That was , of course , until he    got into the Ross himself    and President George W. Bush slapped    tariffs on steel from other countries in 2002 . Those tariffs ,    said Ross , saved 100 , 000 jobs . ’ ’    Okay . But according to a report by the   a year later , those tariffs    also did Those tariffs,    damage . ’ ’    " 200 , 000 Americans lost their jobs to higher steel prices during 200, 000 Americans 2002 . These lost jobs represent approximately $ 4 their jobs    wages from February to November 2002 , " said the report . " More    American a report by the  a year later their jobs in 2002 to higher steel prices    than More   American workers total number employed by the US steel industry itself    ( 187 , 500 Americans were employed by US steel producers in    December 2002 ) . " ’ ’    That’ ’s what happens when you micromanage the US economy . Ross    said that the Trump administration would go after " big numbers ,    big products , big countries , " while at the same time admitting    that its policies would mostly be bringing back 500    here       there . ’ "    Trump ’s entire trade policy is too hands on , the Trump administration individual    pieces to fix rather than adhering to general principles . Dare we    say it , this is the worst kind of big government interference and      one can imagine . " ’    In fact , the entire " America First " executive order   —    forcing    businesses to micromanage what they’’re buying and who they’’re    hiring   —    is an overreach tantamount to the most onerous    regulation . ’ ’    Growing the number of people working good paying jobs is what    really causes GDP growth by adding to labor force       and increasing productivity . To do that , you have to educate your    population for the jobs of the future , not grab onto jobs of the    past . When it comes to manufacturing , those jobs are getting more    and more advanced   —    the people in factories are being trained to    work with increasingly complex machinery . ’ "       US ’s actual jobs The US future are in services   —    like in    education and healthcare ( especially with our aging population ) .    Building a workforce for this is a long game , way longer than the      game most CEOs play . " "    This shows something weird about Ross : You ’d think that a    Ross would probably move in the direction of growth . You ’d    think that a businessman would try to innovate and adapt rather    than try to save a dying arm of his company . But when it comes to    America , a businessman is not doing that . In this sense , he Ross    his    fellows are behaving not like businessmen or Ross    or Ross       wonks , but rather more like rabid ideologues . It ’s a shame and    waste of time .
