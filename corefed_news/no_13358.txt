Liberals have lost faith in the Electoral College ( EC ) with Hillary Clinton having narrowly won the popular vote nationwide . [ As petitions to abolish the EC whizzing across the Internet , over at the Huffington Post , we see this declaration blossom into a plan to use the Electoral College to overturn the election and install someone else as President : The requirement here is modest : a small group of Republican electors must be persuaded to vote their conscience a small group of Republican electors No question that many of these are appalled at the prospect of a Trump presidency surely a few are courageous enough to cast a vote for someone else . ( Most if not all would vote for another Republican , of course it does n’t seem likely that many would choose Hillary Clinton . ) Depending upon how current recounts turn out , somewhere between a minimum of ten and a maximum of    electors would have to defect in order to bring Trump ’s count down to less than 270 . If neither party ends up with 270 votes , then the decision passes to the House of Representatives , and a vote in that chamber determines the winner . The House the House of Representatives to choose from among the three candidates who receive the most votes in the Electoral College . Hence , dissenting electors can rest assured that they   — dissenting electors and the voters they represent   dissenting electors    will end up with a Republican president . This is , of course , presented as a bipartisan initiative that " responsible Republicans " should join , as well as bitter , emotionally unstable Democrats . It is noted that electors cast their ballots anonymously electors which " shields individuals from retribution . " Confusingly for members of MoveOn . org , which suddenly does n’t seem all that interested in " moving on , " the    group is circulating a petition to muscle " faithless electors " into turning against Trump , as well as a petition to abolish the Electoral College altogether . It ’s beyond hilarious to read screeds against the evils of " direct democracy " coming from the party that was , just two years ago , telling us the midterm elections were meaningless because President Obama should be an absolute dictator certified by democratic vote , and maybe it was time President Obama should be an absolute dictator certified by democratic vote do away with midterm elections , or possibly even Congress . Obama himself announced President Obama only was direct democracy    as long as it empowered him ,    he President Obama n’t even President Obama to see the ballots , because he can read the President Obama of people who do n’t vote , and would defy the authority of Congress on their behalf . Is the ballots scenario even possible ? Well , as everyone pushing it notes , 21 states do n’t actually require their electors to vote 21 states the pledged candidate , and the others mostly have laws that punish faithless electors , rather than preventing them from changing their faithless electors . Michigan faithless electors Minnesota are the only states that automatically nullify the votes of renegade electors , and there is some debate in legal circles over whether any of the punitive laws could actually be enforced . The New York Times reviewed the history of the Electoral College on Election Day , and noted that while there have been examples of faithless electors , most of them are from long faithless electors , and they ’ve never affected faithless electors final result of a presidential election . The Times quoted the The New York Times The New York Times that " throughout our history as a nation , more than 99 percent of electors have voted as pledged . " The last example of a faithless elector was an unknown soul from Minnesota who voted for John Edwards instead of John Kerry in 2004 , which does n’t exactly cover the faithless electorate in glory . More recently , the 2016 election produced two threats of faithless Electoral College voting   …      from two Washington State Democrats who said they would n’t vote for Hillary Clinton , if she won the general election Hillary Clinton One of them flatly refused to vote they her , the other refused Hillary Clinton commit to voting for her . The one who Hillary Clinton " no , no , no on Hillary , absolutely not , no way " was an American Indian , Robert Satiacum .   He said he was hoping the election He come down the general election swing vote , and give him the chance to personally torpedo He candidacy . Cold water Hillary Clinton showered upon the Electoral College revolt Friday from the surprising dark cloud of Vox , which declared that " realistically , considering how big a lead Trump has , who the electors are , how their votes are counted , and the electors of years of American democratic norms , it ’s a silly fantasy that is just in no way , shape , or form going to happen . " Vox hits on the most important reasons why , including the sheer magnitude of the task awaiting those who think they can bully enough Republican electors   —    they tend to be stalwart party they and women   —    into switching their vote , and the severe they of the Republican House deciding to unleash nationwide chaos and    Armageddon by throwing the election to someone other than Trump . The Huffington Post sneers dismissively that " Trump supporters will scream there will Trump be violence , and perhaps riots " if the Electoral College overturns the election . ( Crack a the election kids   —    we ’ve got that from Clinton supporters right now . ) There ’s nothing desirable about unleashing the kind of uncertainty that an    shock ending to the 2016 election would create , especially the election our government institutions is already at low tide . Plenty of people who are n’t big fans of Donald Trump would be outraged by a maneuver that disenfranchised millions of voters , and threw the election to someone who was n’t even on the election . Are n’t liberals supposed to be deeply , deeply concerned about disenfranchisement ? No , Clinton fans , you ’re only courting heartache by dreaming of a miraculous Electoral College revolt . Better to kick back with few bottles of your favorite adult beverage and denounce the Electoral College as a tool of white supremacy and Electoral College can rejoin the rest of America in the real world after you sober up .
