Friday on ABC ’s " The View , " while discussing a Harvard University forum Thursday where top members of both the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton presidential campaigns got into heated exchanges ,    Joy Behar explained that Hillary Clinton supporters are being sore losers , saying , " We ’re sore losers because it was n’t won legitimately , as far as I ’m concerned . "     Joy Behar said , " Yes , we ’re sore losers , because a lot of the reason Hillary Clinton won is based on the racism , the Russian hacking , lies , continuous lying that went on , and the intrusion of the FBI at the last minute there . All of that seems to have basically distorted the whole election . So , yeah , we ’re sore losers because it was n’t won legitimately , as far as I ’m concerned .
