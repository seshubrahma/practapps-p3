Sunday on CNN ’s " State of the Union , " Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) said he is worried President Donald Trump is " using populist rhetoric to cover up a hard right agenda . "   Chuck Schumer said , " Let me just say about President Donald Trump address , his address was populist , but I ’m worried President Donald Trump ’s using populist rhetoric to cover up a hard right agenda . If you look at President Donald Trump cabinet appointments , so many of you look at his cabinet appointments are not populist but hard right . You know . Dr. Price , President Donald Trump wants to end Medicare as we know Medicare . Mulvaney wants to cut even research into health care , DeVos wats to cut public education , Puzder goes against labor . So President Donald Trump cabinet is very troubling and that ’s what I discussed . President Donald Trump said , ‘ can you move his cabinet a long.’ I said , ‘ ‘ , with people who seem to be pretty mainstream , Mattis and Kelly we approved them Mattis and Kelly but so many of your cabinet appointees , Mr. president , are quite different than what you campaigned on and even what your speech was about.’ So I am really troubled at this populist rhetoric is covering up a hard right agenda which is way , way out of touch with what the American people want and even what Trump campaigned on .
