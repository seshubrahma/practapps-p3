Thursday , Univision anchor Jorge Ramos said on CNN ’s " Anderson Cooper 360 " that the " Trump effect " is causing a " fear stronger than any wall " that is keeping illegal immigrants from coming into the United States .   Partial transcript as follows : Anderson Cooper 360" : Jorge , the massive drop in border apprehensions last month , the customs border protections says 40 percent , the customs border protections ’s down 40 percent , people trying to cross illegally . What do you make of that ? Is it possible that the tough talk on illegal immigration by President Trump is working , that President Trump deserves credit for that drop ? " RAMOS : Let me just say that fear is stronger than any wall . What we are seeing right now is the ‘ President Trump effect . ’ " These people calling their relatives and their friends , saying , " Do n’t come here , this is not the right moment . " So I think it is possible . Really no one wants illegal immigration , not even undocumented immigrants . It is very risky for illegal immigration, not even undocumented immigrants . It is better to do It in a legal way . And the other positive thing is that , I think , many Americans , many people who voted for Donald Trump , many Americans, many people who voted for Donald Trump really have to understand that there ’s no invasion . No one is invading the United States . Mexicans are n’t invading the United States . The undocumented population has remained stable at about 11 million for the last decade . So those are the positive things . Follow Breitbart . tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
