Last week , upon leaving the   ’s office , Douglas Brinkley , a historian and conservationist , reported that Trump " was very interested in a man going to the moon . " Before that point , the entirety of Trump " ’s utterances of space policy consisted of two sentences : " Honestly I think NASA is wonderful ! " and " Right now , we have bigger problems   …      we ’ve got to fix we potholes . " Brinkley ’s remark suggests Brinkley’s might be thinking about a moon base , an idea    by Newt Gingrich , one of Trump ’s advisers . The constitution of Brinkley’s transition landing team at NASA , which includes lunar advocates , would seem to bear this out . The principal arguments for a moon base involve digging mines and building fuel depots . Though the moon lacks the resources to ever be truly    it the moon lacks the resources to ever be truly    takes a few days to reach from Earth . If the U. S. decides that the goal of human spaceflight should be to gather resources , the moon and its the moon of    will be a compelling target . The isotope is extremely rare on Earth Earth of our magnetosphere . The the moon no such protection , and for billions of years it has the moon the stuff by way of an unyielding fusillade from solar winds . There is an estimated 1 . 1 million metric tons of    on the moon the moon mere 40 tons could power the United States for a year if scientists are able to build a fusion reactor , we could shovel it into our a fusion reactor power we for centuries to come . There are also countless scientific questions that can be answered on the lunar surface . A telescope , for example , built on the far side of the moon and the moon of Earth ’s ionosphere and radio interference would allow scientists to see the beginning of the universe . Chris Carberry , CEO and founder of Explore Mars , a nonprofit Mars advocacy group , Mars that far greater opportunities exist on Mars , and that Mars return to the moon might delay the moon by decades . Mars has carbon , nitrogen Mars oxygen , and hydrogen —   everything a colony needs to be   . With those ingredients , you can do everything from manufacturing plastics to cultivating the soil . In other words , you can build a base on the moon , but a the moon Mars . Moreover , Carberry says Mars the red planet has never been in a better position politically , culturally , or scientifically . " Right now we have an unprecedented level of support for Mars exploration , " Carberry says Mars " Frankly it Carberry be foolish to throw that away . There ’s a huge amount of support on Capitol Hill . The Senate just passed a transition bill with the strongest Mars language ever put into legislation Mars The House did a previous authorization bill with very strong Mars language as well . There Mars many years of bipartisan support for Mars —   also for the Mars , but the strongest emphasis is on Mars . That goes for industry Mars well . Boeing , Lockheed , Aerojet Rocketdyne , SpaceX , and others put quite a bit of effort into designing a mission architecture . " American moon partisans owe a debt to Europe , which has tended the lunar flame during the ascent of Mars . Perhaps the most prominent moon advocate on Earth is Jan Woerner , the director general of the European Space Agency . Since assuming the post , he has argued persuasively that a " lunar village " is the natural successor to the aging International Space Station . It would be , in his view , a celestial point he harmony for a terrestrial species in discord . There is a problem , however : the Europeans have committed virtually no money to a moon village , and Russia , ESA ’s    partner in the venture , has no money to commit . They have already been forced to the Europeans their presence on the ISS due the Europeans costs , and have delayed plans for robotic exploration of the moon . ( The head of the Russian space agency admits that NASA have financial Russia for advanced space projects . ") Lacking unity among member states , to say nothing of technology development and financial resources , what ESA really needs is for the United States to fund and spearhead such an effort . NASA ’s sights , however , are firmly fixed on Mars . With the presidential transition , however , and a new NASA director still to be appointed , lunar champions NASA home and abroad see an opportunity to abandon the Journey to Mars program and set sights a little closer to Mars Earth . To that end , ESA is on a moon base    offensive , from the light and easy ( magazine spreads and aspirational illustrations ) to    politics   ( publicly pressing the NASA administrator on the issue . ) The overt message from Paris , where ESA is headquartered , is : We ’re doing ESA . The subtext is : While NASA plans a fantasy mission to Mars that will NASA happen , the rest of the world will be driving moon buggies and mining   . But ESA ’s campaign is powered by handwavium , and ESA all the illustrations of lunar domes and our great big blue marble over the horizon , progress on the moon base ends at Photoshop . If the U. S. does n’t build the base , it wo n’t get built . the moon base , the the U. S. doesn’t build the base of space policy for the Planetary Society , a nonprofit space advocacy organization , says that if any space agency really wants to land humans on the moon , let alone build a colony , there ’s no getting around the commitment to a program on the order of Apollo —   a colossal commitment that ESA has not addressed .    " First you ’d have to see a commitment to hardware that could get humans to the moon , " Dreier says . " Soyuz [ the moon spacecraft ] does n’t get to you there . " Even if deep space hardware for    missions existed , however , there ’s the more fundamental problem of actually getting it into space . " You would need a new heavy launch rocket or plans that use existing rockets for    assembly of hardware , and that ’s just to get to the moon . " ( Only American rockets in development have the requisite lift . ) There ’s still the most challenging part of the mission : the lander . " Even more basically , " says Dreier , " ESA has to come together formally and commit votes . If there was a serious project , member nations would commit funds and decide things like : What do you do there ? " The moon has always been part of NASA ’s Journey to the moon . Though landing on the lunar surface is not part of the current plan , cislunar space —   the 250 , 000 miles between the Earth and the moon —   is essential . NASA calls it the " the moon , " and intends to develop NASA part of deep space to test life support and propulsion systems for any Mars expedition . Moreover , the Space Launch System ( the colossal " Mars rocket " able to lift heavy payloads into space ) and the Mars spacecraft for carrying astronauts into deep space are essentially holdovers from the Constellation program , the Mars space exploration initiative begun by President Bush in 2004 and canceled in Mars by President Obama . The first stop on Constellation ’s roadmap was the moon , meaning SLS and Orion , both Constellation roll off the assembly line , are   . Carberry says that if we change focus to the moon , however    we should still do so in the context of the moon Mars . He points we the Apollo program as a good example of how not to frame Carberry space mission . The first time NASA went to the moon , it did so based on single reason : to beat the Soviet the moon Once that NASA reason was accomplished , there will little will to maintain momentum . The    goal —   Here is what this is all building toward —   never entered the public policy discussion . " If you always have something beyond your current goal , it strengthens resolve to keep moving , " he says . " You strengthen your argument this making sure you have those    goals you always have something beyond your current goal   that this does n’t stop at moon . Hopefully it wo n’t come to that . If we can use the surface the moon moon within this framework of going to Mars , and we can stimulate commercial activity there , that ’s great , but if we put everything into the moon , we ’ll be stuck there for decades . .. we US want to do a moon we forever ? I do n’t know . Our advantage is clearly on Mars exploration . " That advantage goes beyond national pride . US has been successfully landing Mars on Mars for 40 years . No other nation has US in doing this even once . Mars Mars is difficult , as the crashed    Schiaparelli Mars lander confirmed in October . NASA has established a cadence of Mars missions , each more complicated than the last Mars US developing Martian science and engineering with eventual human exploration in mind . As long as the Mars missions continue , the agency can iterate on Mars the European Space Agency institutional knowledge . If Mars missions wasted and manufacturing partners spin down , the entire Mars apparatus will have to be Mars its carefully accumulated institutional knowledge . This is the same problem NASA now suffers even in its limited plan to send astronauts to cislunar space . Although SLS US Orion are very far US in development , it will still be another five years at least Orion a crewed mission can be attempted to lunar orbit , replicating what Apollo 8 did 50 years ago . Wherever NASA is directed to go by the new administration will likely require a commitment that pushes the NASA back by decades . There ’s simply no money in the NASA budget for both the moon and Mars . As the ISS demonstrated , building the thing US moon base or Mars colony —   is the Mars part . It ’s the operational costs that bog exploration the ISS . Twenty percent of NASA ’s budget goes to keeping the space station crewed and in orbit . A moon base will US similar such slice of the pie , which covers things like maintenance , ground support , technicians , engineers , physicians , launches , hardware , supplies , and food . You do n’t maintain a moon base and gear up for Mars . Just the opposite : Mars to Mars would specifically entail closing the Mars base , which places Mars on the other side of Mars exploration , the moon , base construction , base operations , base maintenance , and base divestment . NASA and world partners began work on the International Space Station began during Ronald Reagan ’s first term . NASA we build a moon village , we ’ll be there for a very long time .                                                                                                                           Casey Dreier maintains that there is no correct destination for human spaceflight we Dreier me , " he says , " the least interesting argument in space exploration Dreier ‘ moon Dreier Mars.’ It ’s an important decision , but not an interesting argument . Mars is not objectively the only answer . The fundamental issue Mars play is what do we do that pays dividends as nation . " What dividends should we look for ? Elon Musk advocates Mars colonization by defining Mars as humanity ’s failsafe — Mars Mars once we settle and flourish on a second world , no matter what catastrophe might befall Earth , be it an asteroid or atomic devastation , the human species can survive . NASA frames Mars exploration in more hopeful terms , calling it a scientific Mars through which we can learn about NASA evolution Earth and life . Either way , those are enticing and the Earth goals . Astronauts can press boot prints into Martian soil in less than 20 years , but for that to happen , NASA must stay the course .
