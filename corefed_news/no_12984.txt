The Huffington Post has published an article defending violence against Trump supporters as a " logical " response to the " racism , nativism , xenophobia , misogyny , Islamophobia , ableism and propensity towards authoritarianism " associated with the Trump campaign . [ The article , written by    writer and    " engaged citizen " Jesse Benn , goes far beyond even the positions of Emmett Rensin , the Vox editor whose call for more    riots resulted in a suspension from "engaged citizen" Jesse Benn job .   Benn , who won a " Mark of Excellence " award from the Society Of Professional Journalists in 2012 , defends    violence as a " perfectly logical reaction " to the " normalization " of Donald Trump , who he says represents the " foulest " tendencies of America . The rise of Donald Trump has exposed the frightening underbelly of America ’s foulest tendencies . Our racism , nativism , xenophobia , misogyny , Islamophobia , ableism , and propensity toward authoritarianism have been laid bare . Benn is particularly concerned that Donald Trump has   expanded the Overton Window , or the range of socially acceptable opinions . There ’s no doubt Benn ’s expanded the Overton Window to include rhetoric previously well outside the Overton Window bounds . Benn calls for a " deportation force " to expel 11 + million people from the country , Benn claims that most Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals , Benn calls to keep databases of Muslims and to enact atotal ban on Muslims entering the country , Benn rampant sexism , Benn mocking people with disabilities , and Benn propensity for lying have brought the already pathetic state of US political discourse to astoundingly precarious lows . Treating this like politics as usual allows it this become politics as usual , and those who do so risk complicity ushering in a new era of fascist politics in the United States . Violence , according to Benn , can help slow the rise of Trumpian politics , preventing the Overton Window from fully opening . In the face of media , politicians , and GOP primary voters normalizing Trump as a presidential candidate —   whatever your personal beliefs regarding violent resistance —   there ’s an inherent value in forestalling Trump Trump normalization . Violent resistance accomplishes this . Furthermore , Benn argues that responsibility for the violence does not lie with the rioters themselves , but with Trump Trump Violence that takes place at Trump Trump —   in support or opposition —   is a reaction to the tone he ’s set , and the blame for it should land primarily on his he . Not the violence a bad thing , says Benn . After all , it gets results the violence Violent resistance matters . Riots can lead to major change ( * note the irony of that hyperlink going to a Vox article ) . It ’s not liberal politicians or masses that historians identify as the spark underlying the modern movement for LGBTQ equality . Nor was it a think piece from some smarmy liberal writer . It was the people who took to the streets during the Stonewall Uprising . It was the Watts Rebellion , not the Watts Battle of Ideas , that exposed the enduring systemic neglect , poverty , inequality , and racism faced by that community . Similarly , it was the LA Uprising , not the LA Protests , that led to significant changes in the Los Angeles Police Department . Those who condemn violence are just privileged . And problematic . Last , I want to briefly note the problematic nature of people with privilege condemning violent resistance to Trump as an absolute moral failing , or denying its logic . Whether you would personally engage in violent conduct matters little to your ability to understand where it comes from . Some people have the privilege to consider the implications of Trump ’s rise in the abstract and negotiate which means are necessary . That ’s not true for everyone . And when those who hold that privilege dismiss the potential validity or logic of violent resistance , it ’s effectively that privilege effort to dictate the rules under which oppressed peoples respond to existential threats , and to silence forms of resistance disagreeable to privileged sensibilities . Last but not least   —    Benn does n’t think the violence should stop even if Trump is defeated . Indeed , he suggests American Benn should continue to copy the tactics of their notoriously violent American leftists cousins . Defeating these systems of power and their underlying apparatuses American leftists   think tanks , conservative radio , Fox News , the Tea Party , etc . —   is a much    and more demanding task than assuring Trump is n’t elected . Taking on the attitudes that drive them is even more difficult . Assuming    protests should be strictly focused on electoral politics and not these broader goals would be a detrimental oversight . Understanding European    use of violent tactics to shut down large rallies from White Supremacists can be illustrative here .
