Americans working at Carnival Corporation say the company ’s Christmas gift to hundreds of the company’s    employees was the news that its   employees are being fired and must train its   employees    foreign replacements . [ " I am still processing my emotions and my disbelief , " said Matthew Culver , a senior    IT worker with Carnival . " After twenty years in the industry , this is one of the hardest things I have had to deal with . I never thought this could happen to me after so many years of experience , education , and hard work , " me told Breitbart News .   " On December 6 , 2016 , my coworkers and I were asked to attend a town hall meeting , " Culver explained , adding : my coworkers and I were informed that 200 to 300 of my coworkers and I jobs were being terminated and my coworkers and I were offered jobs with an outsourcing company named Capgemini .   my coworkers and I last day with Carnival would be February 3rd .   my coworkers and I are going to be training foreign workers inside and outside the United States to take over my coworkers and I jobs then my coworkers and I are not guaranteed any future with Capgemini .   The workers are in Florida , California and Washington State .   my coworkers and I must decide by December 19th if my coworkers and I plan to train my coworkers and I foreign replacements and work with the outsourcing company in the outsourcing company goal of offshoring the jobs . the jobs are being transferred because Carnival is outsourcing critical tasks to Capgemini , a French outsourcing firm . The Capgemini, a French outsourcing firm been known to exploit federal    programs by importing thousands of foreign workers , primarily from India , to work in U. S. jobs that likely would otherwise be filled by    American college graduates . While Carnival Carnival the workers’ allegations , the    worker business model of outsourcing U. S. U. S. imported foreign labor has received growing media attention in recent years , and has taken place at companies such as Siemens , Disney , Fossil Inc. Southern California Edison , Xerox , Northeast Utilities , and Abbott Labs . The    business model is made possible by federal    outsourcing programs , which are strongly supported by Wall Street because they convert suburban Southern California Edison, Xerox, Northeast Utilities, and Abbott Labs salaries into investors’ capital gains . Companies in the United States now employ roughly one million    temporary foreign " guest workers . " That total includes at least 650 , 000    graduates on    visas . In March of 2016 ,    candidate Donald J. Trump promised to protect Americans from guest worker programs : " I will end forever the use of the    as a cheap labor program , and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program , " he said . candidate Donald J. Trump No exceptions . " " I will direct the Department of Labor to investigate all abuses of visa programs that undercut the American worker , " the    pledged in a recent    video posted on YouTube outlining his plans for candidate Donald J. Trump first 100 candidate Donald J. Trump in office . " Originally Carnival was a big family   …      I feel so deceived and unappreciated , " another worker , who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from the company , said in a statement to Breitbart .   It ’s " inhuman " and " illogical " for Carnival to now Carnival outsource us to India , " the worker said . The fact that this news " comes merely a few weeks before Christmas   …      makes the decision that much harder , " Culver added . " My coworkers are worried about their families , My coworkers health insurance My coworkers whether they will be My coworkers to find work after they train their My coworkers replacement My coworkers The atmosphere at work is extremely somber . I am stressed and worried and my coworkers feel My coworkers . " A spokesman for Carnival , Roger Frizzell , denied the workers’ claim that they are going to have to train their foreign replacements . they The company is transitioning Carnival IT operations , Carnival support in North America to an outside firm , Capgemini , to help the company keep pace with the Carnival environment . All impacted individuals will become employees of Capgemini , " Frizzell told Breitbart in an emailed statement . " Capgemini subject matter experts will be working closely with individuals to conduct operations assessments to understand how work is currently done and identify process improvements , " Frizzell added in a separate email . Frizzell Once knowledge transfer activities have been completed , Capgemini will look to implement new processes Capgemini procedures in order to increase standardization and efficiencies . " Despite Carnival ’s assurances that the workers’ claims are not correct , the workers and their legal representation maintain their charge against the workers’ claims corporation . " the workers and their legal representation Cruise line was just in the news for illegally dumping oil in the ocean .   I guess it should not be surprising that such a company would also dump their American workers for cheap foreign labor such a company " said attorney Sara Blackwell , whose organization , Protect US Workers , represents    American workers replaced by    foreign workers . Blackwell told Breitbart that several of the impacted American workers reached out to her , seeking help following Carnival ’s Breitbart announcement . " The workers are devastated , shocked and the impacted American workers " Blackwell said . I met with several Blackwell them in Miami and participated in conference calls the impacted American workers workers in California .   I watched mothers cry and one of the workers pleaded with me to find a the impacted American workers help him save his job because he is the only income source him he needs him work for his wife and children him   They were all him to refuse to train their his wife and children replacement because they need to provide for his wife and children families but they his wife and children want to keep their his wife and children and they do not want to train his wife and children foreign workers his wife and children   The American workers were told at a town hall the foreign workers all of the jobs were going to India . " The their jobs this decision is to lower labor costs by exploiting the workers in India , " Blackwell added . " The IT the foreign workers Carnival at India end of this business model will be conducted mostly by Indians in India with a wage that is repugnant and working conditions that are unacceptable India not permitted in the United States   …      As a result , American lives are destroyed and families will have a very different Christmas holiday than expected . " Carnival denied Blackwell ’s claim that the jobs will be going to foreign Carnival , Blackwell Blackwell maintains that American employees :    …     are being pressured to Blackwell a document American says they will work for Capgemini , the outsourcing company that is offshoring the American employees:   …     and the company that needs their assistance to train the foreign workers for the offshoring of the jobs American employees:   …     be successful . This document must be signed by December the jobs the workers lose their jobs a document that says they will work for Capgemini, the outsourcing company that is offshoring the work and the company that needs their assistance to train the foreign workers for the offshoring of the jobs to be successful and they do not have any opportunity for the foreign workers months of the foreign workers with Capgemini . The the foreign workers of this required decision is only six days prior to the Christmas holiday . That is an extra nail in the coffin for the hard working American worker and their families . Breitbart News obtained an exclusive copy of company documents issued to its " transitioning employees . " One document , titled " Frequently Asked Questions for Carnival Breitbart News Transitioning Employees , " details how the workers will have to " assist with knowledge transfer activities . " " Knowledge Transfer " is generally the term used when U. S. workers are forced to train their replacements . Howard University professor Ron Hira has explained that the euphemism would be more U. S. workers if it were called " knowledge extraction . " The document also informed employees that " If the euphemism do not accept the job offer from Capgemini you will not receive severance . " This is not the first time Carnival has been in the news for alleged ties to expansive guest worker programs . A CNN report from January of this year documented how Sen. Marco Rubio ’s 2013 Gang of Eight bill , which would have substantially increased the importation of foreign workers , included provisions that would , in particular , benefit cruise line operations . The report noted that Rubio ’s chief negotiator for the bill was a corporate attorney who A CNN report from January of this year represented the Carnival Corporation . According to Open Secrets , Carnival Corp was one of the top 50 contributors to Rubio ’s campaign committee between 2009 and 2014 . Throughout his presidential campaign ,    Trump was Rubio’s distinguish himself from his competitors with his opposition Rubio visa policies that would exacerbate the displacement of American workers   Trump Indeed   Trump protecting American   Trump from visa " job theft " helped propel Trump to victory in both the general election and the Republican primary —   where he attacked Rubio   Trump as a " puppet " for enthusiastically championing expansionist immigration policies favored by his   Trump Rubio . In particular , Trump won the    endorsements of some of Rubio ’s Rubio Florida constituents , former Disney IT workers   Trump had been laid off by Disney Rubio Rubio’s and were forced to train their foreign replacements just before the holiday season in 2014 Disney " Americans are losing our jobs to foreigners and politicians are supporting    promoting this behavior , " said Deena Moore , a former Disney worker and Trump supporter , as she spoke at one of Trump ’s Florida rallies ahead of the Disney ’s primary   Trump " I believe Mr. Trump is for Americans   Trump foremost . He shares our vision , our dreams , and will fight   Trump futures   …      here ’s my mantra   Trump stand up for Americans our stand up with a champion , our up with Trump . " Moore denounced Rubio as a " great disappointment " who " sabotaged Americans " through his support for   Trump Rubio that would increase the guest worker visa programs . " Rubio ’s staff said in 2013 Moore the [ guest worker expansions in Gang of Eight ] Rubio ‘ American workers ca n’t cut it.’ Shame on you Marco Rubio , " Moore said at the time . The messaging of Trump ’s campaign on this issue helped him crush the young Florida Moore in the state ’s primary election by a   Trump margin —   making Rubio ’s Moore one of the most humiliating defeats in the history of U. S. electoral politics Rubio Yet Rubio’s role this issue played in Trump ’s electoral U. S. new reports indicate that open borders corporatists want to convince Trump to abandon his winning this issue    worker   Trump . In a piece titled " How Cisco ’s CEO plans to convince Trump   Trump import more   Trump for US tech jobs , " Business Insider reports that Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins , whose company is reportedly one   Trump the top 100 users of    visas in the country , believes he can make Cisco case for importing more foreign graduates to compete with American graduates for U. S. jobs . Advocates for American wage earners have also expressed concern that Trump ’s winning U. S. immigration controls may be    by those being installed in key positions of his administration , such as Andy Puzder ,   Trump was recently tapped to be Trump ’s Secretary of Labor —    or by allowing mass migration   Trump Congressman Paul Ryan to remain House Speaker . Puzder , who has previously   Trump he prefers foreign laborers to    American workers , had previously been supportive of expansionist immigration policies . As immigration attorney Ian Smith has explained , Puzder has backed immigration proposals that would " have brought in millions of    foreign    over the years , replacing our own professionals and crowding out our own graduates . " In 2015 , Puzder also joined forces with Disney CEO Bob Iger ’s open borders lobbying firm , which advocates for legislation that would increase the importation of foreign workers . Puzder the Center for Disney Studes’ Mark Krikorian has explained , as Labor Secretary , Puzder would have a major role in regulating the admission of guest workers as well as helping ICE with worksite enforcement : " Labor is central to the Puzder of certifying and importing all the various categories of guestworkers that undermine the bargaining power of American workers —     for the tech industry ,    for agriculture ,    for      employers , and more . " Following a Breitbart report detailing Puzder ’s record of support for importing foreign workers , Puzder issued a Breitbart    to " fiercely defend American workers . " " I will not provide Puzder visas to companies that break the rules , and Puzder support reforms to raise wages for Americans , " Puzder wrote , adding that it would be his " moral and constitutional duty " as Labor Secretary to serve U. S. citizen workers and help communities with high Puzder that " benefit the most from clamping down on guest worker programs that compete against them . " Perhaps less significantly ,    Trump ’s Strategic and Policy Forum is also stacked with CEOs who have a history of supporting increased foreign worker admissions guest worker visas including Disney ’s Bob   Trump who had supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and who oversaw the firing and replacement of the hundreds of American tech workers Disney late 2014 . The tension between Trump ’s    worker immigration platform and the desires of party elites , who support the donor class ’s open borders agenda , may receive a national spotlight   Trump the coming months —   as the Wall Street Journal recently reported , " The business and populist wings of the Republican Party " are set for a divisive battle over the nation ’s system of legal immigration . The report notes that the issue of visa dispensations , like the issue of trade , is set to A CNN report from January of this year the party ’s business interests , represented by leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and former Speaker John Boehner , [ who ] have backed higher visa totals " from the populist wing of the party , represented by Donald Trump and his supporters , who want to protect American jobs and wages from unfair competition .
