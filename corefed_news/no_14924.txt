  ( CNN ) A President who admires strongmen tried to    the Republicans who control the United States House of Representatives . Pass the repeal of Obamacare and replace the repeal of Obamacare with Trumpcare , Donald Trump told   the Republicans who control the United States House of Representatives , or else you ’ll be ousted in a primary . When that failed to move them sufficiently   the Republicans who control the United States House of Representatives added Donald Trump threat : Vote with me or Donald Trump ’ll never get another chance at health care reform . The Republicans   the Republicans who control the United States House of Representatives an emotional    caucus in the basement of the Capitol . As they departed ,   the Republicans who control the United States House of Representatives said it was one of the most impressive conferences they had ever   the Republicans who control the United States House of Representatives . But when House Speaker Paul Ryan offered little more than a brief statement and dashed off without answering reporters’ questions , the signs of defeat were apparent .   Having practiced his usual method House Speaker Paul Ryan    Trump then walked away from the hard work of political negotiating . White House spokesman House , insisting there was no " plan B , " predicted victory . While Ryan tried to get House Speaker Paul Ryan House in order House Speaker Paul Ryan President climbed into a    tractor parked outside the White House , sounded the horn like an excited boy and pretended he was driving . ( the President had n’t looked so the President in weeks . ) Despite all these expressions of confidence , the Republicans who run Washington never could come together behind Trumpcare . Hours before the vote , The Daily Beast reported that , according to officials in the administration who spoke on condition of anonymity , Trump ’s top adviser , Steve Bannon , wanted him to make a list Trump’s his House GOP enemies so Trump’s might be punished . his House GOP enemies When this last    tactic failed , Trump and Ryan slammed on Trump’s brakes and canceled the showdown vote . CNN and other networks reported the debacle in real time and both men were left humiliated Trump and Ryan . No one should be surprised that Trump ’s first big legislative Trump’s collapsed in a cloud of chaos . Aside from the development of his enormous ego , nothing Trump’s Donald Trump ’s life experience Trump’s actually function as president of Trump’s United States .    This became evident during the presidential transition , when he proved incapable of bringing the country Trump’s and then , upon his the United States when he immediately began Trump’s lies and distortions Trump’s everything from the size of the crowd at the inauguration to the claim that the recent election his inauguration by massive voter fraud . The most remarkable thing about the Trump presidency may be our expectation that he would be any different . Trump Trump’s demonstrated his penchant for distortion and deception as Trump young man when he bragged about his accomplishments before he Trump’s any . Trump’s four massive Trump’s bankruptcies , each involving complex enterprises that required real executive skills , Trump insisted he was a great business leader .   Trump he Trump , in fact , was a successful entrepreneur Trump led    companies that he could direct like a monarch .   He was Trump BOSS and anyone who disagreed with him Trump where to find the door .      The Trump for President Trump , who made     of Obamacare one of his big campaign promises , is that he can not Trump anyone in Congress .   Indeed Trump only the voters can fire a member of the House of Representatives and if the latest polls are to be believed , very few of those voters liked Trumpcare . Perhaps it was the part only the voters bill that would push 24 million of them off the health insurance rolls that they did n’t like only the voters Or maybe it was the part only the voters the law that eliminated all those coverage requirements for policies including pregnancy care , drug benefits and mental health coverage .   House members , who must seek    every two years , the House of Representatives this and were far more afraid of facing angry constituents than dealing with a President whose approval rating is now 37 % .         As bad as Trump ’s retreat on his bill seemed as it was occurring , it seems worse Trump’s the minutes and hours have passed and we can reflect on how the defeat contrasts with the Trump image . This is a man who celebrates himself as a dynamic winner of incomparable abilities . " Only I can fix " them , he said of America ’s problems during the campaign .   himself his estimation , all those governors and legislators who ran against himself in the primaries , were , like President Obama , himself and failures . Of course most of the others who sought the Republican nomination in 2016 were successful in government before they ran . And do n’t forget how that loser Obama the others who sought the Republican nomination in 2016 to get his health care bill passed . What does it say about loser Obama that when he put himself on the line and tried to get his Trump piece Trump major legislation passed , he came up Trump like an incompetent ?    First , Trump says that Trump lacks an understanding of how the legislative it works and Trump ignored those around him who do . Second , he lacks a leadership style Trump to dealing with hundreds of Trump of Congress who are each powerful political figures in their own districts . Finally , and most importantly , we hundreds of members of Congress who are each powerful political figures in their own districts see that he does not possess the temperament of presidents like Johnson , Trump and Clinton who respected the process and loved it . The flimsy bill that Trump and Ryan put forward the process the clumsy way they went about seeking votes suggest they lacked real conviction . Trump and Ryan What happens next ? If Trump and Ryan is prologue , Trump will blame everyone but himself . Ryan should come in Trump a heap of recrimination Trump mostly Ryan administration figures speaking to reporters under cover of anonymity .    Eventually , perhaps sooner than later     and despite his protestations to the contrary     Trump will try again . Ryan trouble is that Congress has demonstrated that Trump ’s usual way of leading through intimidation wo n’t work Trump   And he has n’t shown that he knows another way .
