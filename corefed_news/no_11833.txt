In some of his most serious language to date , President Obama lectured members of the White House press for members of the White House press coverage of Donald Trump , warning members of the White House press to avoid the " spectacle " of the controversial billionaire . [ " I speak to all of you in this room as reporters , as well as the American public , I think , I just want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious times and this is a really serious job , " this said . " this is not entertainment . this is not a reality show . this is a contest for the presidency of the United States . "    Obama added that Obama was " concerned " that reporters were too interested in the drama of the 2016 campaign , rather than the serious issues of the day . " What I ’m concerned about is the degree to which reporting and information starts emphasizing the spectacle and the circus , " Obama said . " Because that ’s not something we can afford . " In response , one reporter appeared to ignore Obama ’s request by questioning one reporter about Donald Trump ’s taco bowl Tweet on Cinco De Mayo .    " I have no thoughts on Mr. Trump ’s Tweets    …      as a general rule , I do n’t pay attention to Donald Trump’s Tweets , " Obama said shortly . " I think that will be true for the next six months , so you can just file that one . " Obama warned Republicans , especially women , to take a close look at Trump , Donald Trump’s them to Republicans, especially women whether Obama represented their values Republicans, especially women " I think Republican women , voters , are going to have to decide , is that the guy I feel comfortable with in representing me and what I care about ?
