.@NewtGingrich : If Romney becomes Secretary of State , you have to wonder if Romney will advocate Trump ’s ideas or Trump own pic . twitter .   Wednesday on Fox News Channel ’s " Fox   Friends , " former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , an early supporter    Trump ’s presidential campaign , cautioned about the prospect of former Gov. Mitt Romney , the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and vocal opponent of Trump Trump the 2016 GOP GOP , being nominated secretary of state .   Gingrich said it was important to make sure Romney would be acting to advance Trump Trump policy and not his own Romney . " Governor Romney Romney be president , not secretary of state , " Gingrich said Gingrich " And you have to ask the question , when he goes overseas Romney is going to be the secretary of state for President Trump or is he going to Romney Mitt Romney ’s own secretary of state ? I would hope , and again I would support whoever    Trump picks because he has the   Trump as the new president to build the team he wants to   Trump . But I would suggest there a lot of other people who are more qualified than Romney on foreign policy and are also have not been actively hostile as he has been Romney " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
