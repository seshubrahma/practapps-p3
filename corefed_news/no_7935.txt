The early exit polls show that nearly half of Republican voters ( 46 % ) polled today made up nearly half of Republican voters (46%) minds today . The same is true for fewer than    of Democrats . This could make the polls in the Republican race , all of which show Donald Trump with wide leads , less reliable than Democrat polls , which showed Bernie Sanders way ahead with Hillary closing a bit .   Per CNN , " Economic issues topped the list of issues in both contests . For the Democrats , the economy and jobs ran evenly with income inequality , with about    citing each as a top issue , while for Republicans , three in 10 cited the economy , and about    each government spending or terrorism . " The polls also show that the GOP race " centered " on voters " discontent " with the federal government and the Republican Party .    Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
