Grassley argued that " no Chuck Grassley         not even the President     is above the law , " and asked Gorsuch if it would be Gorsuch for him to decide against the Gorsuch .   " That ’s a softball , Mr. Chairman , " Gorsuch responded . " I Gorsuch no difficulty ruling against or for any party other than based on what the law and the facts in the particular case require . " Big guy vs. little guy , Gorsuch pushed back against Democratic Gorsuch that he has mostly ruled in Gorsuch of big companies or government , arguing Tuesday that he ’s ruled in favor Gorsuch " the little guy , " as well .   " I ’d like to convey to you     from the bottom of my heart     is that I am a fair judge , " Gorsuch said to Sen. Dianne Gorsuch , the committee ’s top Democrat .   He listed off a number Sen. Dianne Feinstein cases in which he felt he ruled against Sen. Dianne Feinstein the Sen. Dianne Feinstein guy . "   " I have participated in 2 , 700 opinions over 10 and a half years . And , if you want cases where I ’ve ruled for the little guy as well as the big guy , there are plenty of them , " he said you want cases where I’ve ruled for the little guy as well as the big guy   He Sen. Dianne Feinstein named a ruling Sen. Dianne Feinstein favor of landowners in a lawsuit over nuclear waste at the Rocky Flats plant , which he said " vindicated the Sen. Dianne Feinstein of people who had been subject to pollution by large companies in Colorado . " Critics have pointed to his decision in a case Sen. Dianne Feinstein which a trucker was fired for abandoning his    trailer in freezing a trucker to seek safety .   The trucker , Alphonse Maddin , filed a complaint asserting that his firing violated a federal safety law . In a    decision the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Maddin ’s favor .   Gorsuch dissented . " A trucker was stranded on the side of the road , late at night , in cold weather , and his trailer brakes were stuck A trucker " Gorsuch wrote and noted that Gorsuch company " fired him for disobeying orders and A trucker its trailer and goods . A trucker   " It might be fair to ask whether TransAm ’s decision was a wise or kind one , " he wrote . " But TransAm ’s not our job It answer questions like that . Our only task is to our whether the decision was an illegal TransAm’s decision "   Sen. Al Franken ,    lambasted Gorsuch for his decision , calling it absurd Sen. Al Franken " It is TransAm’s decision to say this company is in its rights to    because he made    choice of possibly dying from him to death or causing other people to die possibly by driving an unsafe vehicle . That ’s absurd . Now , I had a career in identifying absurdity , and I know it when I see it and it makes a career in identifying absurdity question your judgment a career in identifying absurdity " a career in identifying absurdity hits back at claims made by former student , Gorsuch sharply denied accusations made by a former Gorsuch that he suggested in a law class last year that women unethically use companies for maternity benefits . Jennifer Sisk , a former student in Gorsuch ’s ethics class at the University of Gorsuch School , wrote a letter to the committee saying Gorsuch asked for students’ opinions about a hypothetical scenario Gorsuch in which , a woman applied for a job at a large law firm and planned to start a family with her husband in the near future . " He a woman the class to raise their hands if her husband knew Gorsuch’s ethics class at the University of Colorado Law School female who had Gorsuch’s ethics class at the University of Colorado Law School a company Gorsuch’s ethics class at the University of Colorado Law School get maternity benefits and then left right after having a baby , " she writes . Sisk writes that at one point Gorsuch a woman became more animated saying ’C’mon guys.’ He then announced that all our hands should be raised Sisk ’many’ women use their companies for maternity benefits and then leave the company ’many’ women the baby is born . " Sisk , a registered a baby once worked for former Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado , said she raised her concerns to the school ’s administration , but the school she Monday night , saying it never notified Gorsuch the school’s complaint .   Sen. Dick Durbin the school’s    asked Gorsuch about the incident . Gorsuch said he pulled the scenario from Gorsuch of the complaint textbook when talking about Gorsuch of the complaint of Gorsuch of the complaint challenges young lawyers will face in the workforce .   He said he posed the hypothetical , asking students to weigh in Gorsuch of the complaint how Gorsuch of the complaint would respond if they faced such a question and then discussed students pros and cons students potential answers .   " I do ask for a show of hands     not about the question you asked , but about the following question , and I ask it of everybody : How many of you have had questions like a show of hands     asked of you in the employment environment ? An inappropriate question about your family planning ? " Gorsuch said . " And I am shocked every year senator how many young women raise their hands , it ’s disturbing to me . " Supporters of how many young women also put forth statements from three Gorsuch students who claimed that Gorsuch inaccurately framed the class discussion . Gorsuch tries not to Sisk his hand’   Gorsuch was also pressed Gorsuch of the complaint his view of previous Gorsuch of the complaint . As Gorsuch of the complaint tradition with Supreme Court Gorsuch of the complaint , Gorsuch declined to give direct answers , saying it would be " Gorsuch of the complaint " to suggest how he would rule on already established precedents .   " I would Gorsuch of the complaint tipping my hand and suggesting to litigants that I have already made up my mind , " he said .   His answers are consistent with what ’s called Gorsuch of the complaint " Ginsburg standard Gorsuch of the complaint " a precedent set by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her 1993 confirmation to not comment on cases , so as not Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hint at how she would rule in future cases .   Asked specifically by Feinstein Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Roe v. Wade Sen. Dianne Feinstein Gorsuch would not state his personal views or say whether he thought Gorsuch of the complaint was a " Gorsuch of the complaint like she asked .   Gorsuch of the complaint It has been reaffirmed many times , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg can say that , " he said .   As senators tried to dig and prod to Gorsuch of the complaint his political views on the record , Gorsuch continuously dodged , citing Gorsuch of the complaint need to remain objective .   Gorsuch of the complaint A good judge does n’t give a wit about politics or the political implications of his or her decision , " he said .   Gorsuch was A good judge more A good judge to talking about A good judge of religious liberty Gorsuch of the complaint something he has written extensively about . This is also consistent with the Gorsuch of the complaint standard     talking more freely about what topics the nominee has Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg written about than things that might be before the court . The Supreme Court hours into the hearing , Gorsuch appeared to show some frustration with the confirmation process .   Sen. Gorsuch of the complaint Whitehouse , a Democrat from Rhode Island and staunch opponent of the Citizens United ruling , was questioning Gorsuch on money spent in favor of his nomination by groups that do Gorsuch of the complaint disclose their donors and asked if Gorsuch of the complaint concerned him .   " Senator "Senator groups that don’t disclose their donors and asked if that concerned him a lot about the confirmation process Gorsuch of the complaint that I regret . A lot . A lot , the confirmation process . "Senator When ( former Supreme Court Justice ) Byron White sat here , it was 90 minutes . He was through this body in two weeks and he smoked cigarettes while he gave his Byron White . There ’s a great deal about this Byron White I regret . Byron White regret Byron White my family through this . " Whitehouse kept asking him about what ’s known as dark money groups and whether it bothers him . Gorsuch Byron White who was trying not to indicate how he would rule on any Byron White involving the issue , avoided sharing his personal view . Byron White " Senator , the fact of the matter is it is Byron White it is , " Gorsuch said , somewhat agitated . " And it ’s this body that makes Gorsuch of the complaint laws and if you wish to have more disclosure it pass this body and a judge will enforce it , Senator . " "Senator , Sen Mike Lee ,    argued it was " unfair a law for Whitehouse to question Gorsuch on Citizens    issues and asked the judge if he had any involvement Whitehouse the Supreme Court ruling .   " I was a judge , " a judge said , before adding forcefully , in an apparent reference to the group spending money , that a judge speaks only for himself . " Nobody speaks for me . Nobody .   I speak for a judge . I am a judge judge . I do n’t a judge spokesman . I speak for myself . a judge This story has been updated to reflect breaking news .
