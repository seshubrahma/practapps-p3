Bannon about the two national political conventions . [ " There was really a measured program , or rather , an effort , to try to silence some of the protesters that some of the protesters knew would happen [ at the Democrat convention ] , " Joe Borelli said . " The prediction of convention apocalypse that the mainstream media predicted for the RNC was actually materialized at the DNC . "   Joe Borelli added : You had protesters dominating some coverage outside , knocking things down . The chairman of RNC resigned in scandal . You had the nominees themselves , their speeches , both Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton , fell completely flat .    …      For a week leading up to the RNC , we were talking about just how big of a disaster the the RNC going to be , and what happened ? You ’ve actually seen it materialize the RNC with the DNC . I ’m sure we ’re not going to see the media bring back the narrative of how the DNC failed the DNC the DNC the Bernie Sanders supporters present , Borelli said , " What you did n’t see last night was an en mass Sanders’ camp moved behind Hillary Clinton . " Pointing out that Democrats often call Republicans fascists , he concluded , " Borelli then you see them not only rigging Democrats often call Republicans fascists election , but then trying to drown out dissent at their own convention . Democrats often call Republicans fascists ’s absurd . It ’s troubling . It ’s troubling to It who likes democracy .
