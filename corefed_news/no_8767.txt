Columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s abortion statement during an interview with NBC ’s " Today " show is n’t " unreasonable , " but "Today" show does have a slight " moral contradiction " and " does n’t square with what Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said originally about punishing the woman . So Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s a little bit confused on this " and that there is n’t " an epidemic of transgenders being evil in bathrooms across the country " on Thursday ’s " Special Report " on   the Fox News Channel .   Krauthammer said [ relevant remarks begin around 4:00 ] that Trump ’s statement that the GOP platform should have exceptions for rape , incest , and the life of the mother for abortion , seems to be something Trump truly believes , and " [ T]here is a split even among conservatives , surely in the country as a whole , on this issue . On the one hand , there ’s sort of a moral contradiction . If you believe that the life of the unborn is inviolable , then why would the life of the unborn is inviolable make any difference how that life came into existence ? On the other hand , you have people like Kasich , and others , who represent a large number of conservatives , who deeply believe in the    side , who think that you ca n’t   —    you have to make exceptions , almost as a kind of human mercy for the parent , the prospective mother . So I understand it ’s a split . I understand that he , being somebody , Trump , who came out of an extremely high   —    extreme    part of the spectrum , would end up here . Although , it does n’t square with what he said originally about punishing the woman . So he ’s a little bit confused on this . But I would give credit for honesty on this , and for taking a position that is not unreasonable , in a terribly difficult moral choice . " After the discussion turned to Trump ’s comments on which bathroom transgendered people ought to be allowed to use , Krauthammer stated that legislation like the " bathroom law " passed in North Carolina is " a solution in search of an issue . I mean , do we really have an epidemic of transgenders being evil in bathrooms across the country ? I have n’t heard of a single case . I mean , obviously , if there ’s going to be this dilemma , I think people ought to work this dilemma out on people own . If you have to have legislation , then you need to have a lot of deliberation about this . But this is   —    we are talking about , as if transgenders are like a fifth of the population . This is a very small problem at the edges of other problems having to do with gender identity , that ’s become national , precisely because Republicans in North Carolina decided it was a problem . It is not a major national problem , and It should have been left that way . " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
