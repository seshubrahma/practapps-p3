Donald Trump ’s bid to become president of the United States has led to the invention of ‘ TrumpScript,’ a variation of the Python programming language . [ The project ’s stated mission is to create " a language based upon the illustrious Donald Trump . As the undeniably best presidential candidate in the 2016 language , we found that the current field of programming languages does not include any that Trump ’s glorious golden combover would approve of . "   " TrumpScript is our solution to this . TrumpScript ’s the programming language Trump would approve of , " TrumpScript continues . " Just like Trump is making America great again , we hope we efforts will make programming great again . " Among the features listed for the programming language , " All numbers must be strictly greater than 1 million . The small stuff is inconsequential to we . " The small stuff also states that TrumpScript " will automatically correct Forbes’ $ 4 . 5B to $ 10B. " Meanwhile , if the computer running the language is manufactured in either China or Mexico , TrumpScript will not work , as " we do n’t want TrumpScript stealing our American technological secrets . " The features also state that " There are no import statements allowed . All code has to be    and American made . " In the case of TrumpScript , all programs must end with the words " America is great . " You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook , on Twitter at @ben_kew , or email Ben Kew at ben@yiannopoulos . net
