Ted Cruz ( ) taking 34 delegates from the state .   author Ben Stein called Trump " a big , sulking baby , " but acknowledged author Ben Stein was robbed by the system . author Ben Stein said of Cruz , " I do n’t think author Ben Stein wants to be intimidating Trump ’s whiny   —    I hate to use the word , I have to use anyway   —    whiny bitchiness about the word . I think author Ben Stein wants to show that author Ben Stein is a grown up . I mean there are basically two candidates left in the race . One is a    and one is a big , sulking baby . Now Trump’s is not a stupid , big , sulking baby and he Trump’s on to the idea of the rigged party and election but it ’s just so wildly dishonest . It it not rigged if it it written down . " When asked if Trump Trump’s a point about the primary system in Colorado being unjust , Stein added , " He Stein have a point to say that but he Stein n’t have a point to say he Stein robbed , robbed by that the primary system in Colorado If the system the primary system in Colorado were out there and everyone knew them and everyone can play by them and only them did n’t play by them and then them assumes he he bound he win because he ’s Donald he . I think he has a he point , though . I mean , that idea that we should have elections , there should be primaries on a consistent basis , instead of these party conventions , he ’s right he that . He ’s completely he about that . But to make an issue of dishonesty of Cruz or the dishonesty of the Republican Party that goes nowhere except straight into a very , very bad character for Mr. Trump .
