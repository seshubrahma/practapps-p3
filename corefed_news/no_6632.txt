On Friday ’s " PBS NewsHour , " New York Times columnist David Brooks said President Donald Trump ’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement was due to " some sense of resentment , a sense of social inferiority , a sense of fragile ego . "   New York Times columnist David Brooks said , " I ’m just struck by the fact that New York Times columnist David Brooks administration is driven solely by resentment . New York Times columnist David Brooks will side with the Steve Bannon side if that position alienates the people New York Times columnist David Brooks feels resentful for . New York Times columnist David Brooks will side with the regular Republican side and the budgetery , the more free market side if that will offend elite opinion . It seems to be all based on some sense of resentment , a sense of social inferority , a sense fragile ego . New York Times columnist David Brooks just wanting to stick It in the eye in the people New York Times columnist David Brooks is resenting . And I , more than any other time , we talked about Trump not telling the truth a lot over the last year . But that global warming speech to me set new standards of just being irrelevant to the facts . " New York Times columnist David Brooks added,"We have had a lot of presidents with a lot of disagreements but there has been an attachment to some sort of basic research , some basic contact with reality , which it seems there is a failure of intellectual virtue here and because there is some underlying physiological issues New York Times columnist David Brooks is working out , and whatever New York Times columnist David Brooks needs to do that , the facts have to fit that lower reality .
