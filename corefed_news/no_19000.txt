’   ’ ’PHILADELPHIA   —    Following a dark and occasionally    rocky Republican convention in Cleveland last week , Democratic    planners . ’ ’    But as raucous protesters shouted over convention speakers and    refused to fully embrace the call for unity , some Democratic    lawmakers began making an argument familiar to audiences watching    the Republican national convention : Think about the Supreme    Court . ’ "    On Tuesday , Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland predicted that Sen. Bernie    Sanders’ former supporters will coalesce around Hillary Clinton    once Sen. Bernie   Sanders’ former supporters realize that Donald Trump ’s election could put several    conservative justices on the court . " ’    " If one or two or three or four young , radical conservative    people were placed on the court , everything the Bernie    supporters care about would be at risk , " Strickland told Business    Insider at an event with climate activists . " If they climate activists a brain    and really thought it a brain      —    I’’m sure they do have brains ,       they bright people   —    they they understand the consequences of    pulling back and not getting on board with Secretary Clinton . " ’ "    Speaking on a panel on Wednesday , Rep. Keith Ellison urged    holdout Sanders supporters to envision what the court would be    like if Al Gore would ’ve beaten George W. Bush in the 2000    election , appointing liberal supreme court justices . " ’’ ’    " This is a very serious situation that we’’re in , " said Ellison ,    one of Sanders Sanders most    supporters in Congress . ’ ’    " The stakes couldn’’t be higher when it The stakes couldn’’t to the Supreme    Court . From a constitutional standpoint   —    if you supported    Bernie , if you believe in a fair economy , if you believe in    criminal justice . .. then there’ ’s not way you’’re going to let    Donald Trump become president . " ’ "    Many Democrats say that raising awareness of Senate Republicans’    refusal to allow hearings to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left    when Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died is a winning    strategy . Hart Research , a polling group that conducts surveys    for    groups , found in a June survey that 50 % of       said replacing Supreme Supreme Court was a very important    consideration in their presidential voters , up from 30 % in 2012 . " "    Further , recent surveys conducted by Public Policy Polling showed    that many voters in swing states like Iowa , New Hampshire , and    Pennsylvania do n’t trust Trump to fill the vacancy . " ’    Earlier this year , the Republican presidential nominee released a    list of candidates he would the Republican presidential nominee to fill the Supreme Court    vacancy . Many Republicans lauded the potential choices , many of    which came straight off a list of potential nominees compiled by    the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation . ’ ’    For their part , Republicans lukewarm about Trump have justified    their    Republicans the nominee by citing the liberal threat to the    court . ’ ’    In a recent interview with NPR’ ’s " Morning Edition , " Senate    Majority Leader Mitch McConnell touted the potential Supreme    Court vacancies as the    issue that ought to change    Republicans ’’ minds . ’ ’    " The single most important thing I would remind       voters in suggesting that they vote voters Donald Trump is : Who do    you want to make the next Supreme Court Supreme   Court " McConnell    Senate   Majority Leader Mitch McConnell . ’ ’    " Donald Trump has already Donald Trump a list of 10 or 11         judges , a list from which he    would pick . Donald Trump think that issue alone should comfort people in    voting for Donald Trump    president . Donald Trump    The majority leader echoed the sentiment in his speech at the    Republican The majority leader in Cleveland . ’ ’    " Tonight I ask you to continue   —    let us continue our work . Let us    us justices on the us Court who cherish our Constitution , "    . ’
