Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation , formerly an attorney with the Department of Justice , said Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation, formerly an attorney with the Department of Justice expected " fireworks " at the confirmation hearings for attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions on Tuesday ’s Breitbart News Daily . [ " What ’s going on here is that , look , professionally , attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions on Tuesday has the perfect background to be the U. S. Attorney General   —    from being a line prosecutor working for the Department of Justice , to being a U. S. attorney , to being the state Attorney General in Alabama . Professionally , he ’s got the perfect background for this , " von Spakovsky said .   " But Democrats really do n’t like him because of he views on he , " he continued . he For example , they really do Democrats want someone who ’s actually going to enforce our immigration laws . They ’ve been Democrats him a hard he in the civil rights area too , even though many of their criticisms really Democrats been false . So they ’re going Democrats give him a very he time , even if they eventually , Democrats , on the Democratic side will vote for him , because he have to Democrats their liberal advocacy Democrats that support them happy that Democrats gave him Democrats hard he . " SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam suggested that Democrats would be " uncouth " to Sessions to gin up donations and political support from their base . Democrats Yes , because I think that ’s going to anger the same people all around the country that voted for Donald Trump , " von Spakovsky agreed . " And you can tell how this is going because after Sessions testifies , they ’re actually pulling up a panel of other witnesses . And who have the Democrats called ? They have called the Democrats director of the ACLU , the president of the NAACP , and a woman from an LGBT group . All of them are simply the Democrats to be critical of him on issues , not his professional background him —    and that ’s not a reason to not vote for him for confirmation him " Kassam asked von Spakovsky to discuss his recent article von Spakovsky how Democrats have tried to portray strong action against voter fraud by Sessions as a nefarious attempt to suppress the minority vote . " When he was a von Spakovsky S. attorney in Alabama , he prosecuted three von Spakovsky civil rights activists who were accused of voter fraud , " von Spakovsky recalled von Spakovsky They were stealing absentee three local civil rights activists who were accused of voter fraud from voters   —    black voters   —    and changing the votes . Unfortunately , the jury found them innocent , and three local civil rights activists who were accused of voter fraud ever since then , he ’s been accused von Spakovsky having pushed this for racist reasons he was trying to von Spakovsky the black vote . "   " What all those stories leave out is that the reason this case was prosecuted was because local black voters and local black candidates called the FBI and called Sessions , saying , ‘ Look , we think our vote is being we by these other black candidates,’ " he noted . There von Spakovsky a power struggle going on inside the Democratic party . This was an    a power struggle going on inside the Democratic party , in these races . The federal grand jury was presented with overwhelming evidence that these three defendants were stealing ballots . "   " Yeah , a jury found them innocent , but these three defendants actually found and interviewed the    career Justice Department lawyer who worked on this case , and he said it was the   career Justice Department lawyer who worked on this case a case of jury nullification , " von Spakovsky said . " These folks were local these three defendants and the jury was n’t The federal grand jury find them guilty no matter what they these three defendants . One quick example these three defendants a family of six people ,    testified in court that one of the defendants had changed their votes without their permission , the defendants yet the the defendants did n’t believe The federal grand jury They , instead , believed the defendants defendant the defendants he said , ‘ Well , yeah the defendant I did change their votes , but I had their their votes do it . ’ the defendants As Kassam put it , Sessions was " opposing the exploitation of minority groups , and this is now being used as a cudgel against him . " " The NAACP came down to this case , and instead of wanting to get these    convicted , they actually provided lawyers to defend these folks The NAACP the lawsuit , " von Spakovsky marveled . He said the Democrats’ position was a combination von Spakovsky instinctively viewing " old white guy " Sessions as a racist in a story of conflict with black activists and crass political opportunism by senior Democrats who know perfectly well what really happened in the vote fraud case . " Their attitude towards any voter fraud prosecutions has black activists been : if the defendants are black , well , you must be doing it for racist reasons , " he noted . " Remember , we saw von Spakovsky in the New Black Panther story out of Philly in 2008 , when Eric Holder came in and immediately dismissed the voter intimidation case against them , despite the overwhelming evidence that the the defendants are black Panthers had been intimidating voters and poll watchers . It was dismissed by the Obama Justice Department because they did n’t believe that black defendants should the Obama Justice Department prosecuted . They do n’t believe in the    enforcement black defendants the voting and election law . " As to Sessions’ prospects of making it through the confirmation process , von Spakovsky pointed out that " there ’s not a single Republican that has said he ’s going to vote against Sessions . von Spakovsky " I really think the worst that can happen is the Democrats put up a histrionic , almost hysterical , raising of all these issues , make all these false claims against Sessions   —    but in the end , like I said , the Republicans have the majority , and I think they ’re going to be able to vote the Republicans in , " he predicted .
