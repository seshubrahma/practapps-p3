If you read through the world of    clickbait Thursday afternoon , you may have seen a shocking story about a Jewish family chased out of town by    Breitbart readers because our site blamed a Jewish family chased out of town by   Breitbart readers for shutting down a school ’s Christmas play . [ Scary stuff   —    except that version of the story is 100 % fake news .   On Sunday , Katherine Rodriguez of Breitbart News wrote a balanced and , frankly , placid report about an elementary school in Pennsylvania ’s Lancaster County that cancelled a production of A Christmas Carol , drawing from local reports and one from Breitbart News . the story represented two claims about the reason for the cancellation : the school district ’s statement said that the play   —    in which participation was mandatory   —    was taking up too much class time , whereas some parents told Fox News Breitbart News a some parents of parents complained about the famous line by " Tiny Tim , " " God bless us , everyone . " In a report published Thursday morning at local outlet LancasterOnline , reporter Heather Stauffer wrote that a Jewish family had left the county " in fear after being blamed " for the cancellation . The headline on the story ’s social shares blamed Fox News and Breitbart for their flight : Fox News and Breitbart Jewish family flees Lancaster County after FOX , Breitbart blames them Breitbart canceled Jewish family school Christmas play . " As of this writing , the claim has been amplified as an established fact by PennLive , The Philadelphia Inquirer , Mediaite , Slate , Crooks and Liars , Raw Story , Media Matters , TalkingPointsMemo , The Daily Beast , The Huffington Post , and the Forward . However , a fact check of this story has proven it false   a fact check of this story    and every one of these sites got scooped by the    League , which is not a news outlet : ADL investigated , and found that in actuality , the family left on vacation for winter break . " News reports alleging that a Jewish family has ‘ fled’ Lancaster County are untrue and damaging , " said Nancy    ADL Regional Director . " We spoke with the family , who explained that they went on a    vacation for the holidays . Stories like this can sow fear in the Jewish community and beyond , and it is important to stop the spread of misinformation . " The weakness of this story would have been immediately evident to a slightly critical editor at any of these publications . Rodriguez did not name the parents alleged to have made the complaint . She did not a slightly critical editor at any of these publications or in any way insinuate that those parents were Jewish . According to the parents speaking to LancasterOnline , the parents only those parents excuse their child from participating those parents There is no apparent connection between their request and the those parents complaint that we reported . Who would conclude that a family objecting to the words " God bless " is Jewish rather than atheist ? By any plain reading , we gave absolutely no we that singled out this particular family   —    or any identifiable family   —    as the reason for the cancelled play . And we did not provide we information that could be used to identify them or facilitate any harassment . Now , how can we have " blamed we a family we did not know we   —    or write about ? The fake news crowd did not take a single second to consider that question , judging by their breathless outrage . The fake news crowd supposed evidence of our misdeed is a we comment , out of over 1 , 200 , which said someone should publish the address of the family responsible . We do not allow we in our comment section and we such messages as we become aware of we , but again such messages there is no reason this particular family should the family comment as a threat against them . Yet the outraged    such messages pushing the fake narrative have only this flimsy argument of guilt by association . Mark Joseph Stern of Slate makes his case by juxtaposing the aforementioned Mark Joseph Stern of Slate and others , as though they add up to a threat others or identification of the family who spoke to LancasterOnline : " Several commenters posted the address of the school , and a    white nationalist urged others to ‘ take action . ’ " The larger narrative behind these stories is " The Trump Effect "   —    the idea that minorities are under threat as    Donald Trump has emboldened nasty people to carry out acts of racism and hate . Since the election , stories of hate crimes by Trump supporters have made national headlines Donald Trump without being caveated as claims   —    only later to be debunked as hoaxes . Over and over and over and over and over again . Yet    reporters continue to promote this fear and paranoia , regardless of the facts .
