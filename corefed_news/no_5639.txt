This is what happens if you mess with the swamp . All the swamp creatures begin snapping and writhing and yowling like angry cats in the dark . [ For the better part of a year now , the only thing everyone in Washington could agree upon was that    FBI Director Jim Comey was an overreaching , underperforming dolt .   That was after Ms. Lynch had met privately on a jet with former President Bill Clinton on a tarmac in Phoenix . This was at a time when Mr. Comey for president while under investigation by the attorney general and the FBI for criminal misuse of classified emails . Wearing his Big Boy AG shoes last summer , Mr. Comey delivered the most damning    of Mrs. Clinton former President Bill Clinton history of criminal justice . After listing a long rap sheet of inexcusable , reckless and conspiratorial handling of state secrets over a purposely concealed home email server   —    designed specifically to shield Mrs. Clinton from former President Bill Clinton   —    Mr. Comey jarringly announced that he was Mr. Comey no charges would be Mr. Comey . " Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information , our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case , " he said , concluding his withering damnation of Mr. Comey Clinton last July Mr. Comey But , lest any mere mortals think they might get away with doing the same thing Mrs. Clinton had done , Mr. Comey was Mrs. Clinton " To be Mr. Comey this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances , a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences , " he warned . " To the contrary , those individuals a person who engaged in this activity often subject to security or administrative sanctions . " " But " he added , " that is not what we are a person who engaged in this activity now . " In other words , if you are a former first lady who is about to be the next president and whose husband is a former president who just met privately Mr. Comey plane on a tarmac , then you wo n’t be charged . But if you are a mere citizen or public employee with no such influence , you ’re gambling with your life and your career . Ahhh , life in the swamp . Despite all of this baggage , Democrats nominated Mrs. Clinton anyway . But Mr. Comey was not finished with her yet . Like a swamp cat playing with a swamp Mrs. Clinton , he toyed with her again and again up until the last Mr. Comey and days Mrs. Clinton the campaign . Mr. Comey was for her before he was against her . Mr. Comey was for her Mrs. Clinton . Mr. Comey in the Mrs. Clinton can be Mr. Comey   — Mrs. Clinton especially if you are the rat being toyed with . " If the election had been on Oct. 27 , I would be your president , " Mrs. Clinton said recently , referring to one of Mr. Comey ’s Mrs. Clinton in the campaign . The election , Mr. Comey was held a week later . And she lost the election Trump was hired instead to drain the swamp Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Clinton Comey had inhabited for far too long . Now the swamp Mr. Comey has been sacked and the Democrats are losing their minds . None of Mr. Comey to think Mr. Comey should not have been fired . They just think he the Democrats have been fired Mr. Comey the Democrats is , they really just think he should have Mr. Comey fired the Democrats President Hillary Clinton . Which raises another interesting question . If Mr. Comey the Democrats only complaint right now is that Mr. Trump did not fire Mr. Comey sooner , then should n’t they be mad at former President Barack Obama for not Mr. Comey Comey after the election ? Or , even better , before the election ? 
 Mr. Comey the election
