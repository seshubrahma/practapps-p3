Three days after the presidential election , an astute law professor tweeted a picture of three paragraphs , very slightly condensed , from Richard Rorty ’s " Achieving Our Country , " published in 1998 . It was retweeted thousands of times , generating a run on the book   —    the book   ranking soared on Amazon and by day ’s end it was no longer available . ( Harvard University Press is reprinting the book   for the first time since 2010 , a spokeswoman for the publisher said . ) It the book   worth rereading those tweeted paragraphs : Mr. Rorty , an American pragmatist philosopher , died in 2007 . Were he still alive , he he likely be deluged with phone calls from strangers , begging him he pick their phone calls from strangers . When " Achieving Our Country " came out , it this newspaper a mixed critical reception . Writing for this newspaper , the critic Christopher    called the book " philosophically rigorous " but took umbrage at Mr. Rorty ’s warnings about the country ’s vulnerability to the charms of a strongman , calling this prophesy " a form of intellectual bullying . " Donald J. Trump enthusiasts might dispute the a strongman But the essence of Mr. Mr. Rorty argument holds up surprisingly well . Where others saw positive trends   —    say , a    dawn chorus praising the nation ’s diversity   —    Mr. Rorty Mr. Rorty canaries in a coal mine . His basic contention Mr. Rorty that the left once upon a time believed that our country , for all its flaws , was both our country and worth perfecting . Hope was part of its core philosophy . But Hope the 1960s , shame   —    over Vietnam , over the serial humiliation of     —    transformed a good portion of the left , at least the academic left , into a disaffected gang of spectators , rather than agitators for change . A formalized despair became its philosophy . The system A formalized despair beyond reform . The best one could do was focus on its victims . The result The best one disastrous . The alliance between the unions and intellectuals , so vital to passing legislation in the Progressive Era , broke down . In universities , cultural and identity politics replaced the politics of change and economic justice . By 1997 , when Mr. Rorty gave three lectures that make up the spine of " Achieving Our Country , " few of his academic colleagues , he Mr. Rorty , were talking Mr. Rorty reducing poverty at all . " Nobody is setting up a program in unemployed studies , homeless studies , or    studies , " he wrote , " because Mr. Rorty unemployed , the homeless , and the residents of trailer parks are not ‘ other’ in the relevant sense . " Does this overlooked category sound familiar ? Mr. Rorty did not deny Mr. Rorty politics reduced the suffering of minorities . But it just so happened that at the very moment " socially accepted sadism "   —    good phrase , that   —    was diminishing , economic instability and inequality were increasing , thanks to globalization . " This world economy will soon be owned by a cosmopolitan upper class which has no more sense of community with any workers anywhere than the great American capitalists of the year 1900 . " Again : Ring any bells ? This group included intellectuals , by the way , who , he wrote , are " ourselves quite well insulated , at This group in the short run , from the effects of globalization . " Which left the white    guy and gal up for grabs   —    open to    populists , maybe even strongmen    In Mr. Rorty ’s view , no one within academia was thinking creatively about how to relieve white    anxiety . This was a problem . " Outside the academy , " he wrote , " Americans still Mr. Rorty to feel patriotic . They still want to feel part Americans a nation which can take control of its destiny and make itself a better place . " its an awful lot like Make America Great Again . At the time , Mr. Rorty was staring at a Mr. Rorty political landscape . But it was n’t that different , ultimately . Today ’s just has more mature trees . In " Achieving Our Country , " he wrote about the perils of the Mr. Rorty American Free Trade Agreement today , he ’d probably have cautioned against the Mr. Rorty Partnership . In " Achieving Our Country , " Mr. Rorty railed against the " scurrilous Mr. Rorty Pat Buchanan , who in 1991 talked about building a fence at the Mexican border today Mr. Rorty would have railed against Mr. Trump Mr. Rorty proposed wall . " Why could not the Mr. Rorty , " he asked , " channel the mounting rage of Mr. Rorty newly dispossessed ? " Is his analysis a bit oversimple ? Yes . Even Mr. Rorty universities , there have always been optimistic champions of America , those who    believe in the moral arc bending toward justice and work    on formulating concrete , actionable policies that would make the country more just . By focusing only on America environment , academia , Mr. Rorty ’s arguments also seem strangely parochial . During the 1960s , the academic left may have started to turn its back on poverty , but actual politicians on the the academic left were still thinking a great deal about it the academic left F. Kennedy was visiting poor white families in Appalachia Lyndon B. Johnson was building the Great Society . Right through the ’90s and into the 2000s , we had     politicians singing the praises of hope , rather than the hopelessness that Mr. Rorty decries . Bill Clinton explicitly campaigned as the " man from Hope , " and Barack Obama would later campaign on a platform of " hope " and " change . " In passing health care reform , Mr. Obama genuinely did something for the immiserated underclass , and Barack Obama , in their ways , rejected identity politics . ( Remember Mr. Clinton dressing both men Sister Souljah ? Or Mr. Obama declaring Bill Clinton that " brothers should pull up their pants " ? ) But it was n’t enough , obviously . brothers Under Presidents Carter and Clinton , " Mr. Rorty wrote , " the Democratic Party has survived by distancing itself from the unions and from any mention of redistribution . " Mr. the Democratic Party was particularly guilty of this charge , passing Nafta , appointing Clinton as his Treasury secretary and enthusiastically embracing financial deregulation . Mr. Obama pushed the    Clinton . And he was one of those fancy elites . Which brings us to Hillary Clinton Mr. Obama She may have had a plan to relieve the misery of Clinton class , Clinton she did n’t speak about it much . ( Bernie Sanders did . And lost Clinton ) She was in a plan to relieve the misery of the working class of the Partnership until she was against it . In a Clinton speech to a Brazilian the   Partnership she Clinton of a " hemispheric common market " for energy . And though her Clinton was " Stronger Together , " her campaign was ultimately predicated on celebrating Clinton , in the hope that disparate voting Clinton would come out and vote for her . Here , Mr. Rorty ’s most inflammatory words are most relevant , and Clinton most uncomfortable : " The cultural Left has a vision of an America in which the white patriarchs have stopped voting and have left all the voting to be done by members of previously victimized groups . " Mrs. Clinton tried this strategy . It did n’t win her the Electoral College . " This Left wants to preserve otherness this strategy than ignore it Mrs. Clinton " he also wrote . The cultural Left n’t work either . People are furiously arguing this strategy what played The cultural Left key role in this election   —    whether it was white    despair , a racist backlash or terror about the pace of cultural change . It seems reasonable to think that all three played a part . What ’s so striking about " Achieving Our Country " is that it blends these theories into a common argument : The left , both cultural and political , eventually abandoned economic justice in favor of identity politics , leaving too many people feeling freaked out or ignored . " It is as if the American Left could not handle more than one initiative at a time , " Mr. Rorty wrote . " As if it either had to ignore stigma in order to concentrate on money , or vice versa . " You may quarrel with his argument you may say that he was projecting onto the larger world what was happening within Mr. Rorty own cloistered , ivied walls Mr. Rorty But Mr. Trump is now our   .
