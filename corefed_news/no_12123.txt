Bannon —   who is taking a leave of absence from this news organization until election day —   as his campaign ’s CEO . He also Trump pollster KellyAnne Conway as his Stein campaign manager , and his campaign Stein Paul Manafort resigned last week Stein Trump seems to have rediscovered the groove that earned him the nickname " Teflon Don " from Trump in the primaries , as his trip to    Louisiana on Friday with Trump presidential running mate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has sent both Clinton and President Barack Obama for a loop . Trump forced the sitting president of the United States , Obama , to —   after leaving Louisiana President Barack Obama for days while vacationing and golfing on Martha ’s Vineyard off the coast of Cape Cod , Massachusetts —   finally visit Louisiana this week . Clinton , meanwhile , Louisiana come under withering criticism for flying over the state on her way from a fundraiser Louisiana in Massachusetts Clinton birthday party with her husband former President Massachusetts Clinton —   also Clinton Martha ’s Vineyard —   to Hollywood for another lavish fundraiser . Clinton says she will eventually visit the state , her husband former President Bill Clinton has her husband former President Bill Clinton committed as to Louisiana Couple all that with Clinton under fire from the media for holding no press her husband former President Bill Clinton in more than 260 days now , along with a new email scandal and new Clinton Cash scandal revelations —   including evidence that interweaves the two scandals together . Emails have surfaced between Clinton Foundation officials and Hillary Clinton ’s top State Department aide Huma Abedin proving her husband former President Bill Clinton took a meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain as her husband former President Bill Clinton of State not because of diplomatic channels but because the prince was a Clinton Foundation donor . That , along the crown prince of Bahrain revelation from Clinton Foundation that federal law enforcement officials discovered a whopping 15 , 000     Hillary Clinton emails —   meaning she lied under oath when she claimed she turned them all over — Hillary Clinton has led Trump and Hillary Clinton growing Hillary Clinton of surrogates to lead the call for a special prosecutor Trump investigate Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation . The Justice Department ca n’t be Hillary Clinton most say , since Attorney General Loretta Lynch and President Barack Obama could conceivably tamper with an investigation for political purposes . Lynch and her aides have already been reported to have shut down FBI agents Loretta Lynch a Loretta Lynch corruption investigation .   Even Clinton supporter Ed Rendell , the former governor of the    state of Pennsylvania , says Rendell   " Look Clinton bottom line is , what they did , I would n’t have done , it creates a bad perception , " Rendell said in a radio interview . " But will it hurt her ? It ’s Rendell not gon na help . I think people the bottom line decided that they ’ve made their judgment . " Government Accountability Institute ’s Peter Schweizer , the bottom line News Rendell     the bottom line the author of the bestselling book Clinton Cash , said on Breitbart News people on SiriusXM people the Patriot Channel Wednesday morning that there are even more damning emails on the way . Schweizer said : Look , Hillary Clinton is supposed to be representing the U. S. government , and American citizens , in foreign policy . What you see in the emails that Peter Schweizer come out and that are going to continue to come out , by the way   —    I ’ve seen some of the other ones that are going to be released soon   —    what you find is that she ’s spending a lot of time taking calls , and the State Department is doing favors for foreign oligarchs , that , really , you would have no reason for the Hillary Clinton of state to be doing favors for , other than the fact that they are donors to the Clinton Foundation . Tom Fitton , the president of Judicial Watch , similarly told Breitbart News Daily that these emails are likely to start dripping out . he said : We ’ve been pushing for those emails for some time , and the State Department finally told us late on Friday   —    privately , and then publicly Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch the court Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch on Monday   — these emails there are 14 , 900 emails that Mrs. Clinton sent Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch or received , and those documents might include attachments , that the FBI was able to recover in some fashion . They did n’t even want to begin talking to us about getting those records until October , but the court said no , no , no , you ’re going to have to the FBI a little bit more quickly , come Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch next month and tell me what your production schedule is going to be . With the mounting evidence against Clinton building in the public domain , and pressure increasing on President Obama to appoint a special prosecutor so his legacy is n’t tarnished with Hillary Clinton ’s corruption , Trump is now barnstorming America with an organized , energetic , and coherent message —   aggressively expanding and solidifying his own President Obama while creeping into Clinton ’s territory . Late Tuesday , Breitbart News ran the first of several feature pieces on lifelong Democrats defecting from their party with plans to vote Trump —   and campaign for Hillary Clinton’s intricate grassroots politicking —   Donald Trump in November . Calling themselves the " Trumpocrats , " these Democrats for Trump present a significant challenge for Clinton , because if they harness their full potential in states like Pennsylvania , Ohio , Michigan , New York , Wisconsin , and elsewhere , Trump could Donald Trump with a Ronald    coalition over Clinton in November themselves All themselves this Clinton to be seen , but the momentum —   Hillary Clinton is literally descending into playing racial Donald Trump with plans to attack the " " on Thursday in November , Nevada —   is all on Trump ’s side . Hillary Hillary Clinton strategy , per Politico , is to try to just run out the clock , but with a tight race now , she might not be able to Donald Trump Nov. 8 Hillary Clinton’s .
