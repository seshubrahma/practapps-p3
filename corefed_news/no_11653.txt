Wednesday on his nationally syndicated radio show , conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh credit Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump with hijacking the Democratic National Convention ’s biggest night thus far by holding a press conference earlier in the day in which he took questions from reporters for an hour straight .   According to Limbaugh , the conference , which included remarks about he opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ’s 30 , 000 missing emails from his opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton server while serving as secretary of state , Trump remarks overshadowed the previous night ’s keynote speaker former President Bill Clinton , who touted he wife as being the best candidate for the presidency . Partial transcript as follows : I really do n’t believe that I have ever seen what I just saw . I ’ve been thinking . I ’ve been trying to dig deep into the dark crevices of my memory , and I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen what I just saw . Trump just hijacked the Democrat convention after the biggest night of that convention so far . Donald Trump the Republican presidential nominee , just concluded , right in time for this program to begin . ( They got Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee memo . ) He just Trump a freewheeling ,          " Whatever you want to ask me , ask me , " press conference the day after the supposedly biggest event yet in the Democrat National Convention . He just Trump hijacked it , and he was Trump . He was Trump his game Trump This was the Trump from last fall . He was Trump , he was Trump , he was Trump no BS from anyone in the media . He was Trump Hillary to do the same thing and calling her out Hillary saying she has Hillary done a press conference in over a year . And she ca Hillary do what Trump did Trump . Hillary Clinton Hillary    is not capable . She ’s not Hillary of doing what Donald Trump Trump . I have never seen a Republican presidential nominee even get involved in the Democrat convention . My experience is that the playbook in the professional , insider world of politics is that when one party is having its convention , the one party party goes one party do n’t run any ads one party they do n’t do any press one party , they do n’t do any appearances one party —    or very few . It ’s a courtesy . It ’s a courtesy and tradition It I guess , that ’s been extended . There have been violations , of course , here and there over the years . But , for the most part , it is a    tradition that has been honored . Now , during the Republican convention , yeah , the Democrats have daily reaction to it that always happens . But the Democrats Trump did today , I have never seen in my lifetime : A Republican presidential nominee go out and do a      much less    press conference and just refuting everything he ’s heard at the Democrat A Republican presidential nominee to date . the Republican convention it up . And , A Republican presidential nominee addition to the Republican convention , he answered questions about this email business and A Republican presidential nominee hack and the Russians and so forth . It just has the media outraged . They ca n’t believe that Trump said some the media the things that he said when he was commenting before he Trump questions on Trump speech by Bill Trump last night   —    which we ’re gon na get into , of course . Hang in there . Trump said   —    and this is Trump . This is a classic demonstration that he has this performer ’s ego and understands Trump to deploy it . He said , " I kept this . Trump There was a chapter in that story I recall and I wanted to hear about it . I kept waiting for it and this for it I never heard this chapter . " this was waiting for a chapter to ask Trump " What chapter , Mr. Trump ? What chapter ? " And Trump n’t gon na answer the question ever Trump That was the point . But he teased ’em . He titillated ’em . " Trump kept waiting to Trump the one ’em . The speech was actually kind of a chapter Trump said of Clinton ’s speech . " It Trump actually kind of boring . " I was waiting for The speech one chapter that could have jazzed it up , but I did n’t hear that chapter . " The speech , everybody knows what he ’s referring a chapter The thing   … Trump And there were a couple of them today . We are working on rolling off the audio right now , so I ’m just giving you snippets from my extensive memory , and I ’m paraphrasing things that Trump said . But this one , this one ’m …      I mean , the media everywhere on both sides of the aisle is just about to have a cow over this one . " Mr. Trump ! Mr. Trump ! Do you have a relationship with the Trump Do you Trump relationship to the hack ? Are you   …     ? Are you   …     ? Are you having any relationship with Russians ? " Trump said , " I do n’t have any investments in Russia the Russians I sold Trump guy a house . I sold a Russian oligarch a house in Palm Beach . I bought the place for $ 40 million and I flipped it for $ 100 million . It was a great deal , but I do the place have any investments . " the place then he said , " I really hope the Russians can find Hillary ’s emails . Trump And you should have seen the the Russians the aftermath on cable networks of the roundtable discussions , particularly on CNN . They could barely keep everybody on camera . They were jumping out of their seats like the Russians were     . " I ca n’t the Russians what he just said the Russians He just the Russians that he hopes the Russians intercede in the presidential election ! That ’s he ! I ca he believe what I just saw ! " One Clintonista , one Clintonista   …      One girl that was supporting Clinton just went absolutely bonkers over that . They do n’t know how to deal with this . They ’ve never   …      The Democrats and the media , they ’ve never had They deal with anything like this . And I have to tell They something , folks . When I got here   —    all night last night and when I ’m working on prepping the show this morning   —    I am under the impression that the first thing I ’m gon na talking about is Bill Clinton ’s speech last night . I ’m saying to myself , " What is there besides that ? There is n’t anything ’m . That ’m the news . That ’s the story . " And I know ( because I know you ) that you ’re dying to hear my take on that speech , and you will hear it in due course . Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
