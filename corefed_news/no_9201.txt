Pundit , author , Constitutional law expert , and former appellate court clerk Ann Coulter joined host Stephen K. Bannon on a Breitbart News Radio special Saturday night to discuss the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia . [ former appellate court clerk Ann Coulter said Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was a giant of The Court because Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia " changed the way people see Constitutional law , and think about Constitutional law , more than any other Justice I can think of . "   " The Court was , as it The Court be , kind of a boring institution for nearly 200 years , " former appellate court clerk Ann Coulter explained .   " And then , the Left figured out that   —    not by any Constitutional framework , but simply by the fact that the The Court the last word , they decide cases   —    liberals realized , ‘ Oh , shoot , we ca n’t get Americans to agree with our crazy ideas we but hey , I bet we could get we Justices to agree ! ’ " The Left was the Left to transform the Supreme Court The Court sort of    of elderly lawyers " who began " suddenly discovering    rights in the Constitution . " Coulter wistfully suggested conservatives should try putting a real activist Justice on the Court , to discover The Court rights " to a flat tax , charter schools , personal possession of automatic weapons , or " free champagne for blondes " ( possibly a    suggestion ) just to give liberals a taste of their own medicine . Coulter praised Scalia liberals going beyond pointing Coulter the absurdity of    activist Court decisions , explaining why they were wrong in a clear and witty manner . She stressed the importance of Scalia ’s Coulter to keep readers engaged Scalia comparing it to presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s use of humor to hold an audience . " We used to wait for his opinions to come out , particularly Scalia dissents , and read them over dinner   …      and particularly the dissents from them for months on end , his particularly the dissents hilarious lines " Coulter said Scalia Scalia ’s jurisprudence .    She cited Scalia ’s dissent in Planned Coulter v. Scalia’s as a particular favorite , mourning the way other    judges such as David Souter , Sandra Day O’Connor , and Anthony Kennedy would so often betray the conservative base . While Coulter said all of Scalia ’s writing was " very clear and very strong , " his dissents were especially energetic . " Scalia when he was writing a dissent , he Scalia gotten kinda fed up with Scalia other Justices , and he would just let loose , " Scalia chuckled . Scalia ’s opinions offered ’d a clear Scalia’s , and I think incontestable description of what Justices are supposed to be doing , which is interpreting the Constitution " in Coulter ’s estimation . " How do you do that ?   You read the Constitution . If there ’s any confusion the Constitution or that word   —    well , how did people understand that word at the time ? " This is the essence of Constitutional originalism , and with Scalia ’s death , America has lost one of the greatest originalists . " If you get away from originalism , there is nothing to tether a Supreme Court Justice to anything other than his personal opinion , " said Coulter . " a Supreme Court Justice what Scalia would look at is , first the words of the Constitution , and then the pattern secondarily   —    and , if necessary , the patterns and practices at the time . " For example , in the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision , Scalia noted the Constitution says nothing about abortion , and the the Constitution criminalized for about a century after the Constitution was ratified , so it was extremely unlikely the Constitution would have considered it a Constitutional right . Similar thinking illuminated Scalia ’s view the Constitution was ratified the Second Amendment , drafted at a Scalia the Founders were strongly convinced the people should be armed with effective the Founders weapons to resist tyrannical government , as they themselves had done . Coulter credited Scalia with helping lower court judges the people law students , and even much of the general public to understand originalist thinking . She found it much easier to follow than the intellectual mush served up Coulter activist Justices . " I remember in law school , you ’d read through some of these opinions from Justice Brennan , and you just ca n’t follow it , " she recalled . " The truth is inherently appealing . And what Scalia Coulter pushing was the truth . " As for Scalia ’s prospective Scalia on the Supreme The truth Coulter thought " the Scalia these craven coward Republicans in Washington " would refuse to confirm an Obama nominee was because of Donald Trump ’s presidential run , because the Republicans know if they " screw us over one more time , on something as big as this the Republicans Trump gets another ten million voters right there . " Coulter was emphatic Coulter President Donald Trump should not fill the seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia ’s death Obama He ’s got , like , ten months left in office . No , no , Coulter , no , no .   Oh , no . And especially Scalia . "
