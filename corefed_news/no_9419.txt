" Partial transcript as follows : All of these progressive interventions for civil rights , All of these progressive interventions for civil rights would be not only dead on arrival , [ Sessions ] would take us back . Because one thing we ’ve seen with other conservative administrations is not only do other conservative administrations stop bringing the cases , other conservative administrations start bringing civil rights cases on behalf of white people . other conservative administrations start saying things like Affirmative Action , like set asides for minority and women owned businesses , other conservative administrations start making the argument those are unconstitutional . Guess what , if Trump gets Trump way with the Supreme Court , other conservative administrations ’re gon na win those arguments . We ’re talking about a radical extremist here who would be in charge of protecting everybody ’s civil rights . Trump has n’t shown any evidence that Trump ’s capable of doing that .
