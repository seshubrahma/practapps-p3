  ( CNN ) By inviting " alt right " ( aka white supremacist ) darling Milo Yiannopoulos ( known as " Milo " ) onto darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") HBO show Friday night , darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") could ’ve seized a great opportunity to expose Yiannopoulos’ history of hate .   After all , Yiannopoulos darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") spewed so much toxic garbage that he darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") permanently banned by Twitter in 2016 , which says a lot , considering the cesspool that swirls on that platform .   So when Maher darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") Yiannopoulos darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") Friday , did the HBO HBO press him darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") his darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") that college rape culture is a fiction and that women are often lying when they women being raped ? Did Maher darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") him darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") his darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") comment that " Jews run the media , "    or did he darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") why Yiannopoulos wore a Nazi Iron Cross when he darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") younger ?   Did Maher darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") him darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") his darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") of transgender people as , in essence , sexual predators ?   No . Instead Maher darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") bonded with the extremist author and lecturer on their shared    views . Yiannopoulos Yiannopoulos Maher darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") " You ’re sound on Islam unlike most people on your show . " To which Maher darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") responded , " Yes , that ’s true . " ( Although when Maher darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") that all religions were " stupid and dangerous , " Yiannopoulos Yiannopoulos back noting that , as a Catholic , he darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") his darling Milo Yiannopoulos (known as "Milo") faith is great . ) You know , there ’s nothing nicer than seeing two people who appear to be on different ends of the political spectrum bond over how much they the political spectrum bond Islam , right ?    And no question : Maher and Yiannopoulos do indeed appear to be in lockstep when it comes to Muslims .   Yiannopoulos , writing that " America has a Muslim problem " has conflated all Muslims with ISIS and has even defended loathing of Muslims with the comment , " fear of Islam is entirely rational . " Maher Maher echoed that very sentiment with his Maher comment about Islam Islam , " The more you know , the more you would be afraid . " And Maher Maher even praised by the    Breitbart , where Yiannopoulos works as editor , for his Maher in 2015 ,    " I think that Islam is a problem . "   On his Maher Friday , Maher Maher gently push back when Yiannopoulos Yiannopoulos HBO " Girls " star Lena Dunham with his Maher response , " Let ’s not pick on fellow HBO stars . "   But why did n’t Maher Maher any time passionately challenge Milo ? In fact , stunningly , at the end of the interview , Maher Maher to be doing his Maher to make Yiannopoulos’ hateful views more acceptable .   Maher Maher the the interview reading " provocative " jokes the late comedian Joan Rivers had made and saying she was Joan Rivers considered a " national treasure . " His Maher appeared to be that if some people gave another comedian a pass , then why should n’t we do the same with Yiannopoulos ? Well , the reasons are obvious : Rivers was actually a comedian , while Yiannopoulos is Yiannopoulos political pundit who writes for Bretitbart . com , a website that proudly spouts    views and was , until recently , headed by Steve Bannon , who is now a senior adviser to the President of the United States , Donald Trump . It ’s especially curious that Maher did n’t stand up to Yiannopoulos , Yiannopoulos that he had Maher roundly criticized for even booking him on Maher show . In fact , Jeremy Scahill , a frequent guest on Maher ’s Maher canceled his appearance for Maher night because he vehemently disagreed Maher Maher presenting Yiannopoulos Maher a national TV platform from which to " legitimize his hateful agenda Maher "   Thankfully , former Comedy Central host Larry Wilmore was on the panel and showed us how you confront hate . In the " Overtime " segment of the show , which can be seen online , Wilmore confronted Yiannopoulos former Comedy Central host Larry Wilmore past Yiannopoulos attack on    SNL cast member Leslie Jones and his hatemongering about transgender Americans .    In fact , when Yiannopoulos asserted that Yiannopoulos people are " disproportionately involved " in committing acts of sexual assault     a lie that has been debunked by experts      Maher remained quiet . It was Wilmore who stepped up to challenge his " statistics . " And when Yiannopoulos went on Yiannopoulos say that being transgender was a " psychiatric disorder , " Maher kept his     Maher ,     Maher it was Wilmore who continued to press Yiannopoulos . The Yiannopoulos between Wilmore and Yiannopoulos escalated until Yiannopoulos told him Wilmore you     Maher go f * * * yourself , " drawing a round of applause from the studio audience     which had no doubt hoped Maher would ’ve summoned half that much passionate pushback .   If Maher has made Maher strategic decision to court Yiannopoulos’ legion of    followers , that ’s his despicable choice Maher   But if he truly wants Maher regain progressive fans and the respect of his peers , Maher when he invites guests Maher Yiannopoulos , Maher should passionately Maher them on their guests like Yiannopoulos , guests like Yiannopoulos mainstream it .
