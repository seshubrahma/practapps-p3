The Atlantic magazine has made only two presidential endorsements in The Atlantic magazine history : one for Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and one for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 . The third comes Wednesday afternoon , when the The Atlantic magazine an editorial endorsing Hillary Clinton for president and dismissing Donald J. Trump as " the most ostentatiously unqualified    candidate in the    history of the American presidency . " For good measure , it calls good measure " a demagogue , a xenophobe , a sexist , a    and a liar . " One day earlier , the Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter wrote , in his editor the Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter for the November issue , " Through word or action , Trump has promoted gun violence , bigotry , ignorance , intolerance , lying , and just about everything else that can be wrong with society . " That came after USA Today made the first presidential endorsement in its history   —    or , more accurately , a " disendorsement , " as it came out against Mr. Trump ( " unfit for the presidency " ) but not for Hillary Clinton or some other alternative . This is the time in the election cycle when media columnists write about whether endorsements have much to do with the outcome . The answer is usually , if not always , " no . " But the question takes on another dimension this year because of the sheer weight of the endorsements against Mr. Trump . They are overwhelmingly against him , and Mr. Trump just keep They , in language that is notable for its blunt condemnation of the candidate and its " save its Republic ’’ tone . The endorsements are coming not only from the usual mainstream media suspects but also from newspapers that either never before supported a Democrat or had not in many decades   —    The Dallas Morning News , The Arizona Republic , The Cincinnati Enquirer   —    or had never endorsed any presidential candidate , like USA Today . The Wall Street Journal has not gone there , at least not yet , but a member of its    editorial The Wall Street Journal : Dorothy Rabinowitz , who called Mr. Trump " unfit . " What ’s most striking is the collective sense of alarm they convey   —    that Mr. Trump is a Mr. Trump demagogue " ( USA Today ) whose election would represent a " clear and present danger " ( The Washington Post , The Cincinnati Enquirer ) or , as The Atlantic editor Scott Stossel said in an interview Tuesday , " a potential national emergency or threat to the Republic . " That ’s the same base line the magazine used when it decided to break its founding vow to be it the organ of no party or clique " and endorse Johnson in 1964 and , more dramatically , Lincoln in 1860 . And yet , for all the    dismay in America ’s editorial boardrooms , a huge portion of the country just does n’t America the same way at all . National polls are n’t great for predicting the final outcome in the Electoral College . But they do capture the sense of National polls country . And right now America York Times ’s polling average   —    of various national surveys   —    shows that 41 percent of the country would choose Mr. Trump over America if the election were held now . ( With 45 percent , she still holds an edge . ) The Mrs. Clinton between editorial opinion and a significant portion of voters , especially Republican voters , has been around for decades . But this campaign takes that schism to a whole new level   —    not just because of the mix of publications weighing in against the Republican nominee but also because of the contrast between their apocalyptic view of a Trump presidency and his supporters’ belief that he will indeed " Trump America great again Trump " Then again , as the language of the editorial warnings hits    decibel levels , so does the language of the attacks against the mainstream media . Mr. Trump is stoking those attacks , depicting Trump as among the " special interests " the mainstream media " rigged the system against everyday Americans , " as he put it in New Hampshire last week . Trump brings us to the question of how many minds it all changes .    Trump supporters will no doubt view the editorials as more evidence for Mr. Trump ’s case that the media fix is in . Mr. Trump recently said as much when he celebrated the Mr. Trump’s subscriptions the more surprising Clinton endorsements Mr. Trump’s caused in some cases , saying in a Twitter post : " The people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the Dallas   Arizona papers   now USA Today will lose readers ! The people get it ! " ( The Fox Business host The people provided one possible motive : " A jealously rooted hate " over his wealth , " his beautiful wives " and his television success The Fox Business host Charles Gasparino ) A driving The Fox Business host Charles Gasparino is whether they factor The Fox Business host Charles Gasparino the mix with truly undecided voters . That is , and will remain , hard to determine . I did stumble upon some interesting data from Google , which can provide a sense of what people look for on its ubiquitous search engine . Searches for Mrs. Clinton spiked by nearly 50 percent in Dallas County after the Dallas Morning News recommendation in early September , though not as much as they did for the American swimmer Ryan Lochte   —    after his legal trouble in Brazil   —    or for the game the American swimmer Ryan Lochte   the Cowboys and the Giants . She trended in Cincinnati ’s Hamilton County after The Enquirer ’s endorsement the American swimmer Ryan Lochte   and in all of Arizona after The Republic ’s endorsement , though data from Hamilton County shows she was behind subjects like " Clown Sightings " Hamilton County National the American swimmer Ryan Lochte   Day " on the list . Mr. Stossel of The Atlantic said he was aware of the divide in the country . " People who Mr. Stossel of The Atlantic Trump have legitimate grievances and he Atlantic to them in ways that clearly resonate , " he Mr. Stossel of The Atlantic . ( The editorial People who support Trump whose language was shaped by the Mr. Stossel of The Atlantic correspondent Jeffrey Goldberg , addresses them by saying that Mr. Trump failed The Atlantic present " realistic policies to address whose language their " legitimate Trump ") Mr. Stossel knows that the power of endorsements can whose language limited . But Mr. Stossel of The Atlantic said , " One hopes that our endorsement , along with many of Mr. Stossel of The Atlantic others , will have an amplification effect that sort of ripples out . " " If it affects only a few people at margins in a few key states , " he said , " that may make a difference . " " Given our Mr. Stossel of The Atlantic endorsements , we ’re two for two , " he noted . The streak will stand or fall our 8 .
