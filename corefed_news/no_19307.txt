’   ’ ’   ’ ’      Few of these stories were bad , but most of these stories suffered from      the same blind spot : race . In telling the story of the white      workers who backed Trump , the white     workers who backed Trump missed the perspective of the      black ones who rejected Trump . This is important . Without the perspective of the     black ones who rejected him , you risk downplaying the consequences of Trump      support —   not for supporters , but for the groups Trump has Trump      targeted throughout his campaign Trump      Empathy without clarity leads      to a place where Trump ’s Trump      to nonwhites —   " stop and      frisk , " mass deportation , Muslim surveillance , etc . —   is treated      as incidental to the story of Trump and his Trump      , Trump      it ’s      the opposite .    ’ ’      One outlet managed to convey that nuance the other night .      Improbably , it was Saturday Night Live . Political      humor is old hat on Saturday Night Live Saturday Night Live ’s rare      to Political     humor anything with real subtlety or sophistication . In      general , we get caricatures and impressions —   exaggerated      renderings of individuals , ideas , and events . Occasionally ,      those renderings are so brilliant exaggerated     renderings of individuals, ideas, and events add something to      our exaggerated     renderings of individuals, ideas, and events understanding of a particular politician . Most      times , they are n’t and they do Most     times .    ’ Most     times      This past Saturday , however , SNL struck gold with one      of its sharpest political sketches in recent SNL . Instead of      Kate McKinnon doing her    bit as Hillary Clinton     Kate McKinnon or Alec Baldwin playing the fleshy i d of Donald Trump , we had      three ordinary people as contestants on " Black Jeopardy ! " a      recurring bit on the show . Kenan Thompson played the host , with      Leslie Jones and Sasheer Zamata as two of the three      competitors . The third was Doug , played by Tom Hanks wearing a      denim shirt , graying facial hair , and a red " Make America Great      Again " hat , and speaking as if through a freshly applied hunk      of Skoal . In past versions of the sketch , the white contestants      are too tied to their whiteness and their political correctness the white contestants      to accurately the white contestants      questions about black cultural tropes and      stereotypes , which is to say that these bits are typically      little more than refurbished Sinbad jokes .    ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’          ’ ’   ’ ’        By this point , the message is clear . On this episode of        " Black Jeopardy ! " the questions are rooted in feelings of        disempowerment , suspicion of authority , and          identity —   experiences that cut across racial lines . Thompson        and the guests are black , but they can appreciate the things        Thompson       and the guests share with Doug , and Thompson       and the guests turn , Doug grows more and more        Doug in their presence ,        that he Thompson       and the guests a " pass " Doug from the group after he refers to them as " Doug people . Thompson       and the guests That        moment is funny , but it also foreshadows the end of               sketch , where this message of commonality —   even solidarity —   is        tweaked and made more complicated .      ’ ’        " Doug , I have to say it ’s been a pleasure , " says Thompson as        the sketch comes to an end . " Well , right back at you my        brother , " says Hanks .      ’ ’        " All right , well , let ’s take a look at our Final Jeopardy        category , " announces Thompson , " ‘ Lives That Thompson "      ’ ’        Jones and Zamata turn to look skeptically at Hanks’        character , while Thompson laughs and gives the punchline Thompson        " Well , it was good while it lasted , Doug . " it which Hanks        says , " I have a lot to say about this . " And then the sketch        comes to a close .      ’ ’        Because the bulk of the sketch is this humanizing           the sketch        , the black host , Doug black        contestants , and the black audience , it ’s easy to read the        message as a plea for tolerance and understanding .        There ’s more that unites us than there is that divides        us . You can even add a class analysis : Black        Americans share more than just common culture with some Trump        supporters ; they share common interests . There are Black       Americans important limits to this , beyond the universe of        SNL : Because of its roots in the South , black        culture shares an affinity with the rural white life that        Doug represents . It ’s not clear this would exist        ,        say , a black audience and           professional        from outside Milwaukee . But at this point , the sketch ’s        argument seems barely implicit : We        to work together        instead of pitting ourselves against each        .      ’ We   ’ ’        Then comes the final punchline , " Lives That Matter . "        Obviously , the answer to the question is " black . " But Doug        has " a lot to say about this . " Which suggests that he does n’t        think the answer Doug        that simple . Perhaps he thinks " all lives        matter Doug        " or that " blue lives matter , " the phrasing used by        those who defend the status quo of policing and criminal        justice . Either way , this puts him in direct conflict with        the Doug        people he ’s befriended . As viewers , Doug        know that        " Black Lives Matter " is a movement against police violence ,        for the essential safety and security of black Americans .        It ’s a demand for fair        equal treatment as citizens , as        opposed to a pervasive assumption of criminality .      ’ ’          Thompson , Zamata , and Jones might see a lot to like in          Doug , but if he ca n’t sign on to the Jones that black          Americans face unique challenges and dangers , then that ’s          the end of the game . Tucked into this    sketch is          a subtle and sophisticated analysis of American politics .          It ’s not that working blacks and working whites are unable          to see the things they have in common ; it ’s working blacks and working whites the          material interests It the former —   freedom from unfair          scrutiny , unfair detention , and          killings —   are in          direct tension with the identity politics of the latter ( as          represented in the sketch by the Trump hat ) . And in fact ,          if Hanks’ character is a Trump supporter , then all the          Trump goodwill in the world does n’t change the fact that          his political preferences are a direct threat          the lives          and livelihoods of his new friends , a fact they          .        ’ ’          the lives         and livelihoods of his new friends , this sketch is n’t some exercise in didacticism . It ’s          genuinely funny with great this sketch from everyone          involved . But it does make a firm statement about this sketch          political world : that racism is a huge obstacle to a kind          of class solidarity . And that , as long as    Dougs          hold on to their identity politics , that obstacle          will remain .        ’
