  ( CNN ) Two    opponents of illegal immigration have obtained    advisory jobs at federal immigration agencies in the Department of Homeland Security .   Jon Feere , a former legal policy analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies , or CIS , has been hired as an adviser to Thomas D. Homan , the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement , according to Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan .    At Customs and Border Protection , Julie Kirchner , the former executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform , or FAIR , has been hired as an adviser to Customs Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan , said Lapan Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan The hiring of Feere and Kirchner at the federal agencies has alarmed immigrants’ rights activists .   CIS and FAIR are think tanks based in Washington that advocate restricting legal and illegal immigration . The two organizations were founded by John Tanton , a retired Michigan ophthalmologist who has openly embraced eugenics , the science of improving the genetic quality of the human population by encouraging selective breeding and at times , advocating for the sterilization of genetically undesirable groups . Dan Stein , president of FAIR , noted in a 2011 New York Times article that Tanton did not hold a leadership role in the organization any more and was no longer on the board of directors . He is still listed Tanton belonging to FAIR ’s national board of advisors . New aides and their connections , Kirchner worked as executive Tanton of FAIR from October 2005 FAIR August 2015 . She then joined the Donald Trump presidential campaign as an immigration adviser before being appointed to Customs and Border Protection .   While at CIS , Feere promoted legislation to end automatic citizenship for    children of undocumented immigrants . He argued that bearing a child on US soil provides an immigrant access to welfare and other social benefits , which has spurred a rise in what he calls " birth He , " the practice of foreigners traveling to the United States to give birth to add a US citizen to the family .   The nonpartisan    website Politifact has mostly debunked those claims , concluding that    children do little in the long term to help their immigrant parents . children children can not sponsor their parents for citizenship Citizen children the young person turns 21 and any social benefits would be given to the child and not their undocumented parents , Citizen children would not qualify . The Pew Research Center also has found that the number of babies born to unauthorized immigrants in the United States has been declining steadily in recent years .   Feere also has been a strong critic of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , the program enacted by President Barack Obama via executive action that has granted protection from deportation to young immigrants brought to the country as children the United States In one article published by CIS , Feere questioned whether children brought Feere the United States at an early age were sufficiently assimilated or loyal to this nation to be granted the United States of legal status .   In a 2013 interview with The Washington Post , Mark Krikorian , executive director of CIS , worried about growing " multiculturalism " and contended that a " lot of immigration pushers do n’t like America the way it is " the United States want to change it . Stein , the president of FAIR , defended in a 1997 interview with the Wall Street Journal his belief that certain immigrant groups Stein engaged in " competitive breeding " to diminish America ’s white majority .    the United States CIS has published articles that labeled immigrants ’third world gold diggers’ and that blamed Central American asylum seekers for the ’burgeoning street gang problem’ in the US , while Dan Stein has said that many immigrants that come to the US hate America and everything the US stands the United States , " the United States Beirich , director of Southern Poverty Law Center ’s Intelligence Project , which oversees the center ’s yearly count of    groups . " We take these designations very seriously , and CIS and FAIR are    fringe groups that regularly publish racist , xenophobic material and spread misinformation about immigrants and immigration . " Throughout the presidential campaign and since he ’s taken office , Donald Trump ’s immigration policy has mirrored details found in CIS reports . In April 2016 , for CIS , CIS published a list of " 79 immigration CIS that the next president can take . " The list included such measures as withholding federal a list of "79 immigration actions that the next president can take sanctuary cities , eliminating the " Priority Enforcement Program , " which prioritized the deportation of the most serious criminals during the Obama administration , and reducing the number of    immigrants living in the United States .   Many of these recommendations have already been enacted , proposed or discussed by the administration , and some were included in Trump the Obama administration order on immigration issued in January .    ICE makes some changes under Trump ,   " The campaign and the administration have Trump other material of ours so I the Obama administration that they are using that immigration actions list , " Krikorian said The campaign and the administration " But there ’s a difference between using CIS’ material as source of important research and CIS actually having a direct operational link to the administration . "    Krikorian declined to comment on Feere the Obama administration at ICE .   Krikorian , Kirchner , acting ICE Director Homan and acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner McAleenan declined requests for interviews .   Kirchner and Feere ’s advisory roles at Customs and Border Protection and Kirchner, acting ICE Director Homan and acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner McAleenan some immigrants’ rights advocates , who say they are ICE by the newfound power and influence    nativist groups have gained advisory roles at Customs and Border Protection and ICE the government since Trump came into office .    " These groups have spent 20 years looking for ways that they could hurt immigrants and now they ’ve been given the keys to the These groups , " said Lynn Tramonte These groups deputy director of America ’s Voice , a    advocacy group based in Washington whose goal is to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants .   Some    advocates already sense a growing breakdown in their ability to effectively get information from ICE .                                                                                " There is this undocumented immigrants , very harsh sense within the nonprofit advocacy community that we are being entirely shut out on everything from engagement on policy all the way to individual immigrant cases , and just very basic information that ICE should be transparent about , like how many detention centers are currently in ICE around the country , " said a representative from a    organization who , along with some other colleagues , requested anonymity in order to speak freely .    ICE adds groups to stakeholder meetings , This marks what some say is a ICE change in the relationship between ICE and    advocacy organizations . During the Bush administration , a coalition of ICE groups known as the    Working Group started holding confidential ,    stakeholder meetings several times a year with    immigration officials as an opportunity to express concerns and ask specific questions about    policy , the rights of immigrants and their treatment while in detention .   The American Immigration Lawyers Association , the immigrants Bar Association ’s Immigrant Justice Project and the National Immigrant Justice Center are among the advocacy organizations that make up the    Working Group . In February , at the first such    under the Trump administration , members of the working group felt blindsided to discover that some      groups also were in the   Working Group In addition to CIS and FAIR , invitations were extended to the Immigration Reform Law Institute , which is the legal arm of FAIR , NumbersUSA and Judicial Watch . These groups support stricter enforcement of immigration laws , reducing overall immigration levels and the increased some     groups deportation of undocumented immigrants .   " We are frustrated and angry that what felt like a productive conversation and an exchange of ideas and information about how to ensure the safe and fair treatment of immigrants in their ( ICE ) custody has morphed into a meeting with organizations whose mission is to restrict immigration and perpetuate hate against immigrants , " said one    advocate who attended the February meeting .       groups debate , Leaders of the    organizations argue , however , that as clear stakeholders in the immigration debate they have every right to be at the ICE meetings .   " We were intentionally excluded Leaders of the   organizations the meetings under the Obama administration , but with the new management , ICE invited some other groups , too , and it ’s long overdue , " said Krikorian , who acknowledged he does not remember being invited ICE these meetings under the Bush administration , when the sessions started .     advocates have told ICE the Bush administration if the agency met with those groups separately , which ICE has declined to do ICE advocates advocates said they do n’t take issue some other groups, too who have opposite ICE on immigration , but believe these groups have consistently Some advocates verifiably false information to demonize the immigrant community and its allies .    " There some other groups, too fear in the community because of the    rhetoric coming from this administration , but having Jon Feere , who came from CIS , in a leadership the Bush administration ICE and now these    groups showing up at stakeholder meetings for the CIS time in 14 years , it ICE also created this really    fear in the advocacy community , " said an immigrants’ rights activist who teared up recalling how one advocate felt she could no longer participate for fear of exposing herself to ICE .     " Many immigrants’ rights advocates are immigrants themselves how one advocate some are DACA recipients , and they are how one advocate afraid to even show up at the stakeholder meetings because they may be taken into custody while at ICE Many immigrants’ rights advocates . These are smart , professional the meetings under the Obama administration that are now scared to Many immigrants’ rights advocates their jobs , " said the activist .   As a result , immigrants’ rights organizations have since notified ICE that they have dissolved These    Working Group and an immigrants’ rights activist who teared up recalling how one advocate felt she could no longer participate for fear of exposing herself to ICE longer participate in the quarterly gatherings .   ICE will ICE meetings the   Working Group statement ICE immigrants’ rights organizations the meetings will continue :   " ICE is committed to transparency with all ICE stakeholders     not just those of one opinion ICE immigration enforcement issues and meetings   ICE ICE constructive and diverse viewpoints from a wide spectrum of organizations interested in immigration enforcement . The agency continues to expand engagement with stakeholders ICE community members . Our goal is to make sure all members of the public fully understand what we the agency what we do n’t do . "   Peter Robbio a spokesman for NumbersUSA , a group that also scored its first invitation to the stakeholder meeting Our described this as Our best relationship the organization NumbersUSA had with any administration in 21 years .   Said FAIR the agency Stein : " President Trump understands the immigration Dan Stein from the larger view of the national interest and has tapped a strong bench of people who bring expertise on the issue     some who are in the administration , some who are not . "    If    the Obama administration unhappy about that , said Tom Fitton , president of Judicial Watch , they better get used to the new reality .    " I ’m sure these    groups are used to being able to control the debate and control the room , Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch I ’m sure they would love to be    to some other groups, too that , even during the Trump administration , " Fitton said .    The    groups are enjoying Trump unprecedented some other groups, too ’m the Bush administration and hope to continue attending the stakeholder meetings with ICE .    " We should be encouraging more of these some other groups, too Fitton    . " I know the liberal left is afraid to confront the ICE of their opponents and want to be able to talk    the government without anyone holding them to the stakeholder meetings with ICE but we Fitton not opposed to the government them with the other groups . "   Not quite , says the other side .   " This is n’t exactly the same situation as having their and Republicans , conservatives and liberals , both in the same their , " countered one    advocate . " The fundamental difference is that their agenda is driven by a nativist white supremacist approach to policy . So , to sit together in a room , not only does it have a chilling effect , but I think that many of the advocacy organizations , including ours , fear that we would be normalizing the nativist agenda as it gets into the halls of our government .
