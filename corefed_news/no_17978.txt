’   ’ ’    Federal Reserve officials say Federal Reserve officials decisions on interest rate    policy hinge on the ebb and flow of economic data , not the whims    of financial markets . ’ ’    Federal Reserve officials have repeatedly downplayed the effect of    market    fluctuations in Federal Reserve officials policy moves , aimed at maintaining a    strong labor market and 2 % inflation over the medium term . ’ "    But the thing about markets is , Federal Reserve officials do n’t really matter until    Federal Reserve officials suddenly do . " ’    That may be the case at the moment , with Fed    officials suddenly signaling in unison , without major    changes in the economic data , that an increase in interest rates    is coming this month . Investors accordingly shifted    from considering a March hike   to seeing it as a   in just two weeks .      What changed ? The stock market continued to set new records    without much underlying economic impetus .   ’ ’   ’ ’    When the Fed released minutes from the Fed end of January    meeting , they showed members " ’ " and her Vice Chair Stanley Fischer , both    speaking on March 3 , appeared to seal the deal for a rate    increase at the Fed ’s upcoming March    meeting   —    with Yellen    indicating that a hike is coming barring a drastic disappointment    in next week ’s February jobs report .   " ’    Stanley Fischer was also was fairly unequivocal . ’ ’    " If there has been a conscious effort to move up our hike    expectations I am going to join our hike    , " Stanley Fischer told a monetary policy    conference in New York , sponsored by the University of Chicago ’s    Booth School of Business . ’ ’    Fischer specifically cited a " wealth effect " from recent stock    market gains as likely fueling optimism among businesses and    consumers .   ’ ’    Since the election of President Donald Trump , the stock market    has been on a tear that few expected before the vote . Share    prices , already elevated before the November vote , have broken    record high after record high .     The consensus among Fed policymakers , while not unanimous , is    that interest rate increases should not be used to prick bubbles    in financial markets , since such monetary tightening risks doing    more harm to the broader economy than good in dampening specific    risks . ’ ’    However , having kept official interest rates near zero for seven    years during the Great Recession and    aftermath , officials    have said officials    are   for potential asset price    bubbles .    ’ "    Yet there ’s still a reasonable economic argument against    raising rates too fast . It ’s true that consumer prices are rising     but overall , US inflation has consistently undershot    the Fed ’s 2 % target , and many Fed members had voiced a preference    for allowing it to exceed the goal for a period in order to show    the threshold is not a ceiling . " "    Some officials still see downside risks to inflation , according    to minutes of the Fed ’s meetings . Charles Evans of the Chicago    Fed , also speaking at the Chicago Booth Conference , cited the    risk of    inflation as one of Charles Evans worries . While low    inflation sounds like a good thing , when it ’s too low it can be a    sign that the economy is operating below the economy potential and wages    are stuck in neutral   " ’    Moreover , economic growth forecasts have not risen materially    above the recent 2 % annual trend despite optimism about the    prospect of corporate tax cuts and a large fiscal stimulus , both    of which require extensive and complex Congressional action . ’ "    Other factors that have underpinned the Fed ’s low rates    policies   —    like the    number of    adults    who have effectively given up on the job market   —    are    also still at play .     In fairness , Fed officials can point to factors beyond a frothy    stock market to make the case for higher interest rates .    Unemployment is historically low and economic growth is steady ,    if unspectacular .   " "    But a Fed that ’s distracted by Wall Street ’s unbridled enthusiasm    risks tightening monetary policy before the economy is truly    ready . Given the high amount of uncertainty associated with the    potential economic policies of President Donald Trump , waiting    for a little more clarity on the outlook might be the    wiser thing to do .
