" Tomorrow the President of the Republic will have a meeting with Italian   Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and I will hand in my resignation , " Italian   Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said . " I take on full responsibilities for defeat and so I say I lost , not you , " Italian   Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told supporters .   The defeat of an Italian constitutional referendum was resounding , with nearly 60 % of voters saying " no " with a high turnout of nearly 70 % .   The euro fell to a 20 month low against the The euro the prospect of instability in the eurozone The euro biggest economy . The result is considered a win for eurosceptic populist and nationalist parties in Italy which campaigned heavily against Renzi and his promise to Renzi Italy ’s sluggish Italy The ’No’ campaign was spearheaded by the    Five Star Movement party , led by Beppe Grillo , which is expected to make substantial gains if a general election is called . " When you lose you can not pretend that nothing has happened and go to bed and sleep . My government ends here today , " Renzi said . More Renzi just the constitution ? Formally , the vote was a referendum on whether or not the country should amend its 1948 constitution . the country Renzi ’s intention was Renzi reduce the power of the upper house of the Italian Parliament , the Senato , by cutting its numbers from 315 intention 100     making it more of a intention assembly . Proponents of the referendum said that the goal was to make the job of governing Italy less complicated and reforms would help revive the nation ’s lethargic economy .   However , critics claimed the reforms would impact the constitution ’s checks and balances .   Elly Schlein , an Italian member of the European Parliament , said the proposed reforms would the reforms much power into the hands of the ruling party . " It was shifting power from the the reforms to the center in a really unbalanced way , " she said . " It was a dangerous reform for the reforms roots of our democratic system . " However , the referendum was widely thought to act as a litmus test for the rising wave of populism spreading in Europe , and the chance to register discontent with the current government .   This , according to Schlein , was Renzi ’s " completely unnecessary " mistake . She said that personalizing and dramatizing she vote meant that many of the people who voted ’No’     particularly the younger voters     did so for political reasons beyond the text of the reform and its consequences .   " The the people who voted ’No’    particularly the younger voters     was transformed into a vote on himself and his government , " she said himself   What happens she ? Italy ’s President will decide what to do next .   He could piece together a government President of the current Parliament or call for a general election in which Beppe Grillo ’s Five Star Movement party is expected to extend populist gains .   Grillo , the        known for Beppe Grillo’s unruly language and mop of President hair      campaigned heavily for a " no " vote on constitutional reforms . He made a name for himself President Italian TV in the President and 1980s and capitalized on his    bravado to promote an President movement spanning both the left and right of politics . Foreign observers fear that if Grillo comes to power in an early election , he ’ll call a referendum to Grillo the euro , go back to the Italian lira , and perhaps even follow Britain out of the European Union . " They have long promised to hold Grillo comes to power in an early election, he’ll call a referendum to scrap the euro, go back to the Italian lira, and perhaps even follow Britain out of the European Union referendum on Italy ’s membership of the single currency , " said Vincenzo Scarpetta , senior policy analyst at think tank Open Europe .

It needs five billion euros after failing the weakest test of its financial health earlier this year . the weakest stock has fallen by more than the weakest % in 2016 . Investors , fearful of the political turmoil , could demand a much higher price for providing the money some banks urgently need . Banks might then be unable to pay that price or find willing backers , a much higher price for providing the money some banks urgently need in need of a state bailout . Banks ’s economy , which has been stuck in neutral for decades , is also likely to suffer . Renzi ’s government had embarked on a series of reforms aimed at boosting growth and prosperity .
