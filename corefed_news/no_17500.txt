  ( CNN ) There were about three seconds on Tuesday when I was excited about the idea of Donald Trump running for president , if only for the entertainment value . Then Donald Trump opened Donald Trump mouth .    Perhaps the lowest point , in a speech filled with low points , was when Donald Trump started bashing Mexico and Mexicans     and , in so doing , also bashed the fundamental values on which our own nation is founded . " When Mexico sends Mexico people , " Donald Trump said during Donald Trump presidential announcement , " its people ’re not sending the best . its people ’re not sending you , its people ’re sending people that have lots of problems and its people ’re bringing problems . its people ’re bringing drugs , its people ’re bringing crime . its people ’re rapists and some , I assume , are good people , but I speak to border guards and its people ’re telling us what we us getting . " Let ’s us a moment on that , shall we us    Trump is explicitly playing into an     narrative that is not only factually dumb but divisive and dangerous . Maybe we us n’t be surprised , given Trump Trump continually questioned the authenticity of President Barack Obama ’s birth certificate , but it Trump shocking nonetheless .   In Trump Trump formulation , it Trump not just Mexicans who are evil     they Mexicans all rapists and drug lords , Trump Trump without any facts to base this upon     but Mexico the country is also evil , deliberately sending " those people " with " those problems . "   Trump Trump not only preying on , but feeding the xenophobic fears of mostly conservative white Americans who see immigration not as about economic realities but as a national threat     people who use rhetoric about " hordes " " swarming " the border , which is also the kind of talk that undermines any notion of humane immigration policy . I also hope it goes without saying how deeply offensive such comments are not only to    but Latino Americans in general .   And frankly , it it offend every American whose own ancestors once came to this country as immigrants , immigrants who were almost all at one point denigrated and demeaned by the majority . Immigration and integration are among the best parts of America ’s story .   Xenophobia and racial bias run through our ugliest chapters .   " I will build a great , great wall on our our border , " Trump continued in his Trump , " and I will have Mexico pay for that a great, great wall on our southern border Mark my words . " Never mind that we already have a significant fencing system along key parts of the border our southern border that Border Patrol agents laying more fencing will not stop desperate migrants and crafty smugglers .    Facts are nothing to Trump . Nor , apparently , is common sense . How , for example , would he get Mexico Trump pay for such a wall , especially if the country is Mexico as Trump suggests ? Trump also wonders why he ’s not Trump there ’s no fence at all along the northern border . Canada must not be an evil nation . " The U. S. has become a dumping ground for everyone else ’s problems , " Trump thundered . Trump actually , the world has become a dumping ground for U. S. economic policy The U. S. few countries feel this more than Mexico , where our free trade agreements opened the border to cheap the northern border     cheap because it ’s subsidized by our tax        which flooded the Mexican market and killed local agriculture . By 2001 , just seven years after the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect , one out of every three tortillas in Mexico was made with imported corn Mexico one report suggests . And a similar dynamic affected other crops and industries . We ’ve literally been dumping our cheap subsidized crops and    We in Mexico     not the other way Mexico .    Immigrants do n’t generally leave their families , home countries and Immigrants they ’ve ever known just because Immigrants want to     it ’s Immigrants because they feel they have no choice Immigrants You Immigrants think a successful businessman would know the realities of these economic and policy forces . But certainly , we should expect such basic knowledge in our president . Of course , we ’s no way Trump will become president . Polling suggests Trump is , in fact , Trump most disliked political candidate since 1980 . And that ’s saying a lot . But Trump is n’t in this election Trump win he ’s in this election to Trump off his this election views     cheered Trump by a tiny but equally loud right wing of the Republican base . Somehow , like Trump , the more absurd and Trump and marginal those views become , the louder they are yelled .    We are those views increasingly pluralistic and    nation , and hopefully increasingly inclusive nation as well . If Trump does n’t like it , Trump ’s no one Trump can fire to change things Trump He should just quit .   Trump us on Twitter @CNNOpinion . Join us We Facebook . .
