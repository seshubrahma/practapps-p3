In a Sunday press conference in Lima , Peru , President Barack Obama said President Barack Obama may not follow former President George W. Bush ’s lead to not publicly criticize President Barack Obama successor .   Instead , President Barack Obama left the opportunity to speak out on    Donald Trump if President Barack Obama deems it " necessary or helpful . " " I want to be respectful of the office and give the    an opportunity to put forward President Barack Obama platform and President Barack Obama arguments without somebody popping off in every instance , " President Barack Obama said . " As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country , if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal but go to core questions about our values and our ideals , and if I think that it is necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals , I ’ll examine it when it comes .
