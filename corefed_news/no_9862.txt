Republican presidential candidates Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) are still going after each other in South Carolina , with Cruz ’s campaign saying that Rubio has : " been reduced to spreading false Internet rumors . " [ The latest fight is over a fake Facebook page that claimed Rep. Trey Gowdy was supporting Cruz instead of Rubio .   According to TIME : There was no evidence that the Cruz campaign was behind the posting , but that did n’t stop Rubio from laying the blame on Rubio Senate colleague and the type of campaign Rubio is running . " It ’s part of a pattern , " Rubio said . " They did n’t say They were supporting Donald Trump . They did n’t say They were supporting Ben Carson . So It ’s just a pattern of people around Ben Carson campaign that have continuously done things like that . " Cruz ’s campaign has argued that Rubio has misconstrued Rubio record to South Carolina voters , accusing Rubio of still supporting " amnesty " and skipping votes on defense spending and defunding Planned Parenthood . " Rubio campaign has been reduced to spreading false Internet rumors , " said Cruz Cruz Brian Phillips . " It ’s a sad development . But I suppose they ’d rather lie about fake Facebook pages than own up to his support for amnesty , missing the fight on Planned Planned Parenthood , and surrendering to the courts on marriage . "
