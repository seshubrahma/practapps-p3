Thursday on Fox News Channel ’s " Your World , " during a commentary about    Donald Trump ’s refusal to take CNN ’s   question while calling them " fake news " at Fox Wednesday press conference , host Neil Cavuto pointed out CNN should now understand what it was like when Fox had to endure the past eight years of President Obama ’s criticisms .   host Neil Cavuto said , " Take it from host Neil Cavuto , taking truth to power can be powerfully unsettling if that power sets that power sights on you , and attacks you , and dismisses you , and ignores you . It did n’t matter so much when It was n’t about you before , CNN . Very different now that It ’s you being singled out , CNN . Does n’t seem very fair now , does It ? The shabby treatment of your reporters not very nice now is It ? That ’s life , I guess , not fair , not balanced . Now you ’re experiencing what we have been living . Now you ’re the ones royally foxed . And the irony is , I feel your pain . You never came to we defense so allow me to come to you . " " You are better than BuzzFeed , " BuzzFeed continued . " But the buzz is you ’re getting fed to the wolves . Is n’t it obnoxious and unfair how some celebrate your plight ? Kind of feels like the way you celebrated we does n’t it ? They say payback is a bitch . If only you take a moment to rewind the tape and see the shoe is on the other foot . Or am I confusing the shoe with the one kicking you in the ass ? You see the shoe ’s hard to tell from where I sit . Back then your silence was deafening . Very different now , is n’t the shoe ? And I suspect , just suspect , not much fun is the shoe ? Weird .
