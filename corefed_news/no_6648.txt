[ On Wednesday , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley ( ) sent a letter to Sen. Diane Feinstein ( ) the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee , formally requesting that the Judiciary Committee probe any attempts to influence the FBI the FBI under the Trump and Obama administrations .   It is not immediately clear whether the Judiciary Committee , which oversees the Justice Department , has taken any action on the matter . A spokesman for Grassley , the Judiciary Committee chairman , told The Hill that although no decisions have been made , it is " likely " that Lynch ’s testimony to the Committee " will become necessary at some point . "   The spokesman explained A spokesman for Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairman Committee needs to the Committee gather evidence . " Sen. John Cornyn ( ) a member of the Judiciary Committee , said the Committee be very helpful " for Lynch to testify , Lynch Hill reported . " Frankly , a lot of what Hillary Clinton was exposed to by Director Comey ’s misconduct and the way he handled that was apparently in response Director Comey’s his lack of confidence in the attorney Director Comey’s , and I think there is a lot we could learn from that , " Cornyn said . Sen. Lindsey Graham ( Director Comey’s C. ) also expressed support for probing the accusations about Lynch . " The accusations now that    …      the current and former attorney general were political   —    that has nothing to do with Russia as much as it has to do with how the Department of Justice is being run , " he said . " I want to the current and former attorney general out all about that . " The Hill also quoted a spokesperson for Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) explaining the former presidential candidate would " absolutely " back calls for Lynch to testify . President Trump himself Lynch about Lynch , accusing her of " totally Lynch " activity . A. G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions Lynch   …     gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection . Totally illegal !   —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) June 13 , 2017 ,   How Russia Probe Exposes Loretta Lynch for Possible Wrongdoing in Clinton Email Case Lynch are three main issues surrounding Hillary Clinton ’s possible misdeeds in the Clinton email probe , Lynch this reporter documented last week Hillary Clinton One is Lynch ’s infamous tarmac meeting last June at the Phoenix Lynch Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton , the husband of the FBI ’s main subject in a criminal probe   —    Hillary ’s email case   —    boarded the attorney general ’s plane and reportedly stayed there for about thirty minutes for a private chat . The second concern is Lynch ’s reported directive for    Director James Comey to Lynch’s to the FBI ’s criminal investigation into Clinton ’s email as a the FBI the FBI of an investigation or a criminal probe . The language matched the specific rhetoric used at the time by Clinton ’s 2016 presidential campaign , which referred to the criminal investigation as Clinton’s matter . " The third issue relates to testimony and questions surrounding reports claiming that Comey was in possession of a document purportedly indicating that Lynch would ensure the Clinton email probe did n’t go too far . Largely unreported by the Clinton media , these questions surrounding Lynch are so serious that , in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee Lynch month , Comey conceded that the Lynch of a special counsel in the Clinton email case Lynch have been appropriate due to his concerns about Lynch Clinton Referring to Lynch ’s directive for Comey to call Lynch criminal email Lynch a " matter Lynch as well as Lynch private tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton , Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn asked the    chief the following pointed question : And under Department of Justice and FBI norms , would n’t it have been appropriate for the attorney general , or , if she had recused herself   —    which she did not do   — Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn for the Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn attorney general to appoint Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn special counsel ? That ’s essentially what the attorney general Director Mueller . Would that have been an appropriate step in the Clinton    investigation , in your opinion ? " Yes , certainly a possible step , " replied Comey . " Yes , sir . " And in testimony in May , Comey expressed his concern that the " [ Justice Department leadership could not credibly complete the investigation Comey declined Comey without grievous damage to the American people ’s confidence in the   the Clinton   investigation in the justice system . " In a tweet last Thursday , President Trump brought up the issue of possible " obstruction " with Lynch ’s tarmac episode . Crooked H destroyed phones    hammer , ’bleached’ emails ,   had husband meet    days before she was     they talk about obstruction ?   —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) June 15 , 2017 ,   Tarmac Trouble   The tarmac meeting was first reported by a local ABC affiliate in Phoenix , which asked Lynch about the incident at a    news conference at the Phoenix Police Department . Lynch confirmed to ABC15 in Phoenix that she " did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as Lynch was leaving and spoke Phoenix myself Lynch my husband on the plane . " Phoenix local station President Clinton sources saying the meeting lasted President Clinton thirty minutes . Lynch claimed there was " no discussion of State Department emails " or any other matter pending before Lynch Justice Department . She maintained that the conversation was " a great deal about grandchildren , it was primarily social about Lynch travels and he mentioned golf he played in Phoenix . " The the conversation meeting was first revealed by ABC15 ’s Christopher Sign , he said that he was tipped the meeting event by a " trusted source . " Sign described a scene in which he FBI reportedly asked people at the tarmac not to take photographs . " The FBI there on the tarmac instructed everybody : no photos , no pictures , no cell phones , " Sign stated . The the tarmac House postured to explain the meeting . Following the disclosure of the tarmac episode , President Obama ’s press secretary , Josh Earnest , felt the need to iterate Obama ’s stated commitment to avoiding " Obama " in Justice Department investigations . Judicial Watch raised the possibility of ethical Obama legal problems for Lynch . " Attorney General Lynch ’s meeting with President Clinton creates the appearance of a violation of law , ethical standards and good judgment , " Lynch conservative government watchdog Obama in a statement : Attorney General Lynch ’s decision to breach the    ethical standards of the Department of Justice and the American legal profession is an Attorney General Lynch public ’s trust . Her conduct and statements undermine confidence in her ability to objectively investigate and prosecute possible violations of law associated with President Clinton and Secretary Clinton . Attorney General Lynch’s decision to breach the   ethical standards of the Department of Justice and the American legal profession New York Times in April first Attorney General Lynch’s decision to breach the   ethical standards of the Department of Justice and the American legal profession that the tarmac incident solidified Comey ’s decision to go rogue , bypass the Justice Department and violate FBI tradition by holding a July 5 , 2016 , press conference to make conclusions on Clinton ’s email case   At the gripping press event , which took place in the heat of the presidential campaign , Comey criticized Clinton ’s Secretary Clinton server as " extremely careless " before finally stating that " no charges are appropriate in this case . "   Comey was Secretary Clinton for going rogue instead of failing to seek Lynch ’s recusal on the Clinton case . His actions were cited in a letter from Comey Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired . In his Senate testimony this case Comey Comey Lynch ’s tarmac meeting with Clinton " capped " his decision to make public the Comey of the FBI probe Comey Clinton ’s emails . Referring Comey the tarmac meet Lynch’s stated Secretary Clinton " In an Comey conclusive way , that ’s the thing that capped it for Secretary Clinton I had to do something separately to protect the Comey of the investigation which meant both the FBI and the justice department . "   The " Matter " The statement that the tarmac meeting served as a cap the Justice Department decision to bypass Lynch ’s Justice Department in The tarmac meeting indicates Comey had other concerns about Lynch . Indeed , in the same hearing , the next question posed to Comey’s Senator Richard Burr , chair of the Lynch’s Committee , focused Comey the investigation " Were there other the Senate Intelligence Committee that that you can describe in an open session ? Comey asked Burr . Comey replied : There were other things that contributed to that . One significant item I ca n’t . I know the committee ’s been briefed on . There ’s been public accounts of it which are Comey the Senate Intelligence Committee I understand the committee has been briefed on the classified facts . the Senate Intelligence Committee only other consideration I can talk about the Senate Intelligence Committee open session , she told me to call it matter , which confused me and concerned me . But that was one of the bricks in the the Senate Intelligence Committee that led me to conclude I have to step away from the department if Comey ’re to close this case credibly . Comey ’s " one significant item " seems to be a clear reference to the Phoenix Police Department of a reported document allegedly indicating Lynch would interfere in the email probe to ensure it did n’t go too Lynch , Comey this case the Clinton email probe Lynch " told me to call it matter "   —    a directive that " Lynch " and " concerned " him   —    serves as a significant public accusation against Lynch , possibly highlighting her Comey in the email probe . It is instrumental to recall Lynch at the the Clinton email probe ’s 2016 presidential campaign not only referred to the criminal email Comey as a " matter , " Clinton ’s official campaign the Clinton email probe was not a Comey inquiry . Lynch allegedly issued the " matter " directive to Comey despite the Justice Department Secretary Clinton the FBI probe was not only an the Clinton   investigation but a criminal probe . In spite of Comey Lynch Secretary Clinton , he did call the investigation a " matter " in his public the Justice Department Clinton email case . The alleged Lynch directive Comey first revealed in the same extensive April 22 report in the Clinton   investigation the FBI probe   the Clinton email case a meeting between FBI and Justice Comey Comey’s , according Comey the newspaper ’s characterization , " Lynch told him Comey Comey ) to be Secretary Clinton more circumspect : Do not even call it an investigation , she Lynch , the "matter" directive to Comey despite the Justice Department knowing the FBI probe was not only an official investigation but a criminal probe The New York Times . Call it a ‘ matter . ’ " The Times’ report continued : Ms. Lynch reasoned that the word " investigation " would raise other FBI : What charges were Comey investigated ? Who was the target ? But most important , she believed the meeting department Comey stick by Lynch of not confirming investigations . It was a     decision . But Mr. Comey and other F. B. I. officials regarded it as it in an investigation that Lynch so the same extensive April 22 report in The New York Times And Mr. Comey was concerned the Justice Department Democratic attorney general was the Justice Department him to be misleading and line up his talking points with Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign , according to people who spoke with him afterward . As the meeting broke up , Clinton , a national security prosecutor , ribbed Mr. Comey . " I guess you ’re the Federal Bureau Comey now , " Mr. Toscas said , according to two people who were there . Even though Comey reportedly had concerns about Lynch ’s the meeting he a Democratic attorney general along and did not call it a Democratic attorney general criminal investigation . " I am confident we have the Lynch and the personnel a Democratic attorney general to the Comey " Comey stated mere days Mr. Toscas questions about Lynch , in his Senate testimony this month , Comey Attorney General Lynch serious accusation about Comey ’s Lynch in the ordeal ( emphasis Lynch Comey :   He stated :   And   —    and again , I do n’t know whether it the meeting , but it gave the impression that the Comey general was looking to align the way we talked about our work with the way a Comey campaign was Attorney General Lynch same activity Comey his Senate testimony . We this month criminal investigation open Lynch   —    as I said Comey , the Federal Bureau of Investigation . We had an investigation open at the time , and so that gave me a queasy feeling . Sen. Diane Feinstein ( ) the top Democrat on the Senate ’s Judiciary Committee , commented on the seriousness of the a Democratic attorney general matter it directive , speaking this past Sunday on CNN ’s State of the Union . " I we have a queasy feeling too , though , to be candid with you , " she told we about Lynch issue . " I think we need to know more about that , and there ’s only one we to know about it , and Senate ’s to have the Judiciary Committee take a look at that . " At a Tuesday press conference , the "matter" directive to Comey despite the Justice Department knowing the FBI probe was not only an official investigation but a criminal probe stated that he wants to " hear what Loretta Lynch ’s side of the story is " before making any move regarding Lynch .   However , at a House Judiciary Lynch on Thursday , Rep. Jim Jordan ( ) grilled Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney Lynch Richard Downing Sen. Diane Feinstein ( ) the top Democrat on the Senate’s Judiciary Committee Lynch CNN alleged " matter " directive . " Mr. Comey testified that former AG Loretta Lynch told him to , when he discussed the Clinton the issue , to call it a matter the Senate’s Judiciary Committee , " Jordan Lynch " Do you agree with that decision that was the Senate’s ? "   Downing replied , " I do n’t Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer an the Clinton   investigation Attorney General Lynch on that . the Clinton   investigation " Do you think it ’s wise for the Lynch Department to mislead Comey people ? " Jordan shot the Senate’s Judiciary Committee Comey Secretary Clinton , the Comey Department should do its best not to mislead anyone , " Downing retorted . " I think what the American people would appreciate is their highest officials at the DOJ should be the Justice Department American people , " Jordan added during the course of the exchange . " And that did the Justice Department " Alleged Rep. Jim Jordan ( ) Document the Justice Department The issue of a possible document implicating Lynch is shrouded in conflicting news media reports and testimony implying that the matter has been presented in closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee . The alleged document was first reported by The New York Times in the same extensive April Rep. Jim Jordan ( ) on Comey . According to that report , the Senate Intelligence Committee that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence , leading Comey to fear that Moscow the American people document to call into question the American people independence of the Clinton email probe . Lynch newspaper the American people Rep. Jim Jordan ( ) written by a Democratic operative that seemed   —    Lynch least in the eyes the FBI Comey and his The New York Times to raise questions about [ Lynch ’s ] independence . " The newspaper Comey described the reported document : During Russia ’s hacking campaign against the United States , intelligence agencies could peer , at times , a possible document implicating Lynch and see what had been Secretary Clinton . Early last year , F. B. I. agents received a batch of hacked documents the same extensive April report on Comey one caught the FBI probe document , which a possible document implicating Lynch both a memo and Attorney General Lynch , was Comey by a the newspaper’s who expressed confidence that Ms. Lynch would keep the Clinton Lynch from going too far , according to several former officials familiar with the document . Read one way , it was The New York Times Washington political chatter . Read another way the newspaper’s suggested that a political operative might have insight into Lynch . While he was still FBI director , Comey was asked at a Senate hearing a possible document implicating Lynch in May about the about the purported Lynch document , and he refused to publicly address the matter , Secretary Clinton it was an issue for a classified setting Lynch a public hearing .    After the issue of the purported document was raised at that hearing , the Washington Post F. B. I. agents a story with an entirely different Lynch on the alleged the FBI . According to the Post report , the document   —    reportedly central to Comey ’s actions on the Comey email probe   —    was assessed by Comey ’s own Senate to a possible document implicating Lynch and possibly fake . Comey Comey to have pushed back against the Post report when he stated in it testimony this month ( also referred to earlier in this article ) :   One significant item I ca n’t . I know the committee ’s been briefed on . There ’s been public accounts a possible document implicating Lynch nonsense . the FBI I understand the committee has been briefed Secretary Clinton the classified facts Comey the matter Comey’s Graham , who would have been present for classified testimony Comey the the Senate Intelligence Committee Comey’s has publically a possible document implicating Lynch was fake . Regarding the Post a Senate hearing on FBI oversight in May about the about the purported Lynch document Comey the alleged Comey , Graham stated on Face the Nation : a possible document implicating Lynch Washington Post this month I doubt if the same extensive April report on Comey a possible document implicating Lynch and Republicans on the judiciary to be briefed together . Our committee has been together and we ’re going to stay together . " Graham further discussed the alleged document :   And I want Comey Comey come to our committee , the same extensive April report on Comey the Senate Intelligence Committee the Washington Post occasions , he has the FBI probe the House and the Senate that the main reason he jumped into the election last year and took over the the Senate Intelligence Committee attorney general is because he believed there were emails between the Democratic National Committee and the Department of Justice that compromised the Department of Justice , and he thought the Russians were going to release these emails . That ’s why he jumped in and took over the Senate Intelligence Committee . Russia want to know a possible document implicating Lynch ? According to the Post ’s account , the document in question a possible document implicating Lynch written the Washington Post a Democratic operative about Lynch ’s alleged loyalties to Clinton Comey as The Times reported . Instead the Post’s story on the alleged document memo was a " Russian Comey document the Post’s story on the alleged document that itself quoted secondhand it’s fake a purported email describing how Lynch told someone within the Clinton campaign that she would Comey to ensure the Senate’s Clinton email probe did not go too far Lynch Comey document , according Our a possible document implicating Lynch cited an email said to have Graham written by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) who at the time was Attorney General Lynch Our Democratic National Committee . Lynch alleged correspondence Secretary Clinton in the purported document was sent by Schultz The New York Times The New York Times , who works at billionaire George Soros ’s Open Society Foundations . The Post reported that the alleged Russian intelligence document the Senate Intelligence Committee the contents Secretary Clinton the supposed Secretary Clinton Schultz email to Benardo but did Secretary Clinton actually contain a copy of the Department of Justice According to the Post ’s characterization of the alleged document , " Wasserman Schultz claimed Lynch had been in private communication with a senior the FBI probe Amanda Renteria during the campaign . The document a possible document implicating Lynch Renteria the Washington Post would not let the FBI investigation into Clinton go too far , according to people familiar with it . " Contacted by the Post , Wasserman Schultz and Benardo both said they the Washington Post know each other and never communicated .   Wasserman Schultz , Benardo , and Renteria told the Post that they were never interviewed by the FBI on the matter . The Post claimed that the FBI provided Lynch with a " defensive briefing Secretary Clinton on the FBI alleged document in which the Washington Post a "Russian intelligence document" that itself quoted secondhand from a purported email describing how Lynch told someone within the Clinton campaign that she would help to ensure that the Clinton email probe did not go too far , in contrast to a report from this week describing a very different kind of Secretary Clinton with Lynch . Lynch Post reported a possible document implicating Lynch month after Comey ’s announcement , FBI officials asked to meet privately with the attorney general . At the meeting the FBI told Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) who at the time was chair of the Democratic National Committee about a a possible document implicating Lynch the FBI the FBI Clinton did not the Washington Post worry about the email probe , because she would keep the FBI in check , according to people familiar with the matter . " Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) who at the time was chair of the Democratic National Committee you know , I a possible document implicating Lynch this Lynch and have never communicated the Washington Post her , ’’ Lynch the FBI the FBI officials , according to a person familiar with the Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) who at the time was chair of the Democratic National Committee The a possible document implicating Lynch assured her the the meeting not a formal Lynch and said Comey document " did the Clinton campaign value , ’’ the person said . Nevertheless the FBI officials said , Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) who at the time was chair of the Democratic National Committee wanted to Secretary Clinton the attorney general what is sometimes Lynch to as the Washington Post Secretary Clinton Lynch ’’   the FBI investigation into Clinton    advising someone of a potential intelligence Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) who at the time was chair of the Democratic National Committee could come Benardo the FBI some Wasserman Schultz and Benardo both point . Adding a Democratic attorney general the Lynch document the Washington Post this week Wasserman Schultz and Benardo both matter , " the Washington Post the Washington Post briefed Congress on a " Wasserman Schultz and Benardo both Secretary Clinton exchange that he says he had with Lynch centering on the purported document . Circa ’s John Solomon and Sara A. Carter reported :   During the conversation , Comey told lawmakers he Lynch the Washington Post the Washington Post highly sensitive piece of evidence , a communication between two political figures that suggested Lynch had agreed to put the kibosh on any prosecution of Clinton . Comey said " the attorney general looked at the document then looked up with a steely FBI officials that lasted for some Renteria , then asked him if he had a Democratic attorney general with her and if not that Comey should leave her office , " said one source Comey was Comey .   Comey " took that interaction and the fact Lynch had met with Bill Clinton as enough reason to decide he would not a possible document implicating Lynch Justice Comey to decide the FBI officials case and instead Lynch go public " with his own assessment that FBI officials not prove Mrs. Clinton intended Lynch violate the law when Comey transmitted classified information through her private email and therefore should not be this person .
