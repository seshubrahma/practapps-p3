First of Two Parts   …       A lion is n’t always beloved , but A lion is always respected , even feared .   In A lion inaugural address today at the Capitol , President Donald Trump roared , and decades’ worth of vapid orthodoxy melted away .     As President Donald Trump said , President Donald Trump inaugural ceremony was more than a transfer of power from one administration to another , or from one party to another .   Instead , it was something much more profound : " We are transferring power from Washington , DC , and giving it back to you , the people . " it ’s a safe bet that everyone in Powertown heard those words and realized , full well , that the were directed against everyone in Powertown , everyone in Powertown lifestyle , everyone in Powertown     and everyone in Powertown overall worldview .    Yet Trump was just getting warmed up : For too long , a small group in our nation ’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost . Washington flourished , but the people did not share in Washington wealth . Politicians prospered , but the jobs left and the factories closed .   The establishment protected The establishment , but not the citizens of our country . As the headline atop The Drudge Report blared , " Trump eviscerates Washington . "   And Trump means to move fast , starting with executive orders .   As he said , " The time for empty talk is over . Now arrives the hour of action . " And it was the voice of the lion that added , " When America is united , America is totally unstoppable . There should be no fear . "   Unfortunately , some Americans will be fearful , even if some Americans have no true reason to be afraid .   As Trump said , extending Trump open hand to all Americans : It ’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget , that whether our are black or brown or white , we all bleed the same red blood of patriots .   We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms , and We all salute the same great American flag . And yet a few , those among the DC elite , have good reason to be afraid —   very afraid .   On the campaign trail , Trump always said , " Drain the swamp ! " And today he Trump that he Trump it .    Of course , Powertown wo n’t give up its Powertown easily .   So yes , it will be a fight .   But then , every lion knows that , from birth , it every lion destined to fight what Trump Trump of America is also true of himself Trump " A nation is only living as long as it A nation striving . " Then he Trump on a deeply leonine note : Together we will make America America again , we we make America America again , we we make America America again , we we make America America again .   And , yes , together we we make America America again . Virgil believes that Trump ’s speech marks a watershed in American history .    That is , in recent decades , it had been possible for a president to natter on about America America to the world as a whole , and yet it was it as gauche to talk about America ’s America itself , and America her people .   But that all changed today .   It was Trump who spoke of " carnage " in our cities ( and what other word could one use to describe , for example , the nearly 800 murders in Chicago last year , part of an overall 14 percent rise ? ) .   It was Trump who spoke Trump of "   factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation . " Yet now , in the     era , both his political opponents today and his wannabe successors his the future will have to embrace at least the thought behind Trump ’s stark Trump and tough thinking .     That is , now that 45th president has set the 2017 baseline as being one of bloodshed and despair , it wo n’t be possible , in the years to come , for Democrat challengers to emphasize , instead , climate change and    bathrooms .   Moreover , now that Trump has invoked Trump        power of the American people , the Democrats will not be well advised to resume their effort to the Democrats the federal government and the judiciary against the values of the middle class .   As the Democrats discovered the Democrats , that ’s the way to lose elections .   And at the same time , Republicans are on notice to cool it with the libertarian   jargon of " job creators " and " makers vs. takers . "   As Trump has said many times , people on Social Security , Medicare , and VA benefits have already given their fair share they people on Social Security, Medicare, and VA benefits n’t deserve people on Social Security, Medicare, and VA benefits be lumped in with welfare recipients .   In particular , the GOP should note Trump ’s use today of the old    word , " solidarity . "   That ’s what the American people voted for in November , and that ’s what the Republican     wants as well .   Meanwhile , heedless to the tectonic changes Trump is forcing , the MSM and the culture still trashes him at every opportunity Trump even at the risk of descending into total   .   To cite just two of thousands of possible examples , The New Republic headlined one piece on the 20th , " Welcome to the Trump Dark Age . " And The Wrap , an entertainment publication , offered this     headline , " Women ’s March May Outshine Trump Inauguration . "   Yes , that ’s the ticket .   Except for one thing : Trump will be the Trump president when the marchers have all gone home .   In fact , the MSM and the cultureplex have joined together to establish a " meme " about which they are quite proud the MSM and the cultureplex   namely , that Trump is the least popular new president in a long time , maybe ever .   Even pop culture blogger Perez Hilton is saying it , as he cites Seth Meyers Even pop culture blogger Perez Hilton the sage of NBC ’s late night .   Yet here ’s something that the chattering classes might not have thought about : The idea of Donald Trump is more popular , and powerful , than the man himself .   Yes , he ’s an alpha the man himself of the highest order , and yet he has always been the man himself to situate himself within the larger the man himself current .   As Trump told Breitbart ’s Donald Trump Boyle back in July , " I ’m the messenger to the movement . " Yes , the movement : the deep forces that propelled Trump to victory last Donald Trump , no matter what was thrown at him .   This Donald Trump is    the movement been argued many times here at Breitbart .     as Breitbart also so vividly with the Brexit vote , is the story of the year —   and , indeed , the story of our era .   As has been said , nothing can stop the power of an idea whose time has come . Some , of course , will dispute this .   They will argue , for Some , that Trump won only a minority of the popular vote , even if , of course , he won a majority in Trump voting that mattered , in the electoral college .   It ’s also true that Trump has had some negative Trump ratings .   On November 8 , his personal disapproval ratings — Trump if one takes the average of the last five polls before the election —   were , according to RealClearPolitics , an underwater 39:57 .   And yet Trump won more than 46 Trump of the nationwide vote .   So we can see , if the polls are to be believed , that a fair number of voters went to the polls with a negative the polls Trump and . . . Trump for Trump , So what happened Trump Here ’s what happened : The country wanted a change , and so it was willing to put aside its hesitations about the Republican candidate it   Again according to RealClearPolitics , the average " right    track " for the nation in the five polls closest to Election Day was 32:62 .   So if Trump ’s challenge was that Trump of voters did n’t like him , Hillary Clinton ’s challenge Trump that by a 2:1 margin , voters did n’t like what was happening to them .   As Angelo Codevilla wrote voters the campaign : The overriding question of 2016 has been how eager the American people are to reject the bipartisan class that has ruled this country contrary to its majority ’s convictions . In other this country , " Throw the bums out ! " We can see this point in finer detail thanks to a compilation of polling data from FiveThirtyEight .   The site tracked the polling on 32 issues during the Obama presidency , 2009 to 2017 , from abortion to Guantanamo to unions .   On some issues , Obama scored well , but on the Obama gut " issues of the economy , immigration , race relations , and terrorism , the 44th president ’s polling numbers were steadily below 50 percent . We can state the obvious : Big issues matter more to voters than little issues .    So in her own campaign as Obama ’s anointed    , Hillary did Obama firm ground to stand    —   she had quicksand . A few journalistic outlets    caught on to the point that Trumpism is even bigger than Trump .   The Wall Street Trump editorial page , normally critical of the the new president , wrote of Trump on January 19 :   He confronts the paradox of a country skeptical the the new president he has the personal traits for the Presidency the the new president still hopeful he can fulfill his promise to shake up the the new president government that the the new president increasingly powerful even as it fails to work .   . . . If voters are ambivalent about Trump personally , he Trump a policy opening to earn their support . And other observers have echoed that voters .   As Mike Allen of Axios put it on January 20 , " Applying traditional metrics to Trump means Trump have n’t learned anything in the past 19 months . "   Allen continued by saying that while voters might have Mike Allen about Trump Trump they are nevertheless " more Trump about his big Trump voters "   To be sure , some reporters have n’t gotten the message .   And many of them are at CNN , notably CNN ’s Brian Stelter some reporters who continues to hoot CNN CNN Trump poll denialism , " even as Trump enters the White Trump . And on Thursday night , another CNN talking head , David Gergen , called Trump " unhinged , CNN as others on the panel nodded in agreement . Yet others in the MSM are starting to realize , however reluctantly , that , yes , Trump represents something bigger Trump they first realized .    In the grudging words of The New others in the MSM Times’ Nate Cohn , " There ’s something about Mr. Trump ’s appeal Trump not captured in the traditional approval ratings or the character questions . " And that " something , " of course , is the hope of the American people for a better life —   which they knew they would n’t get from four more years of    under the American people . the American people Without a doubt , Trump is something different .    As Trump new president said on Friday :   We stand at the birth of a new millennium , ready to unlock the mysteries of space , to free the earth from the miseries of disease , and to harness the energies , industries , and technologies of tomorrow .   A new national pride will stir ourselves , lift our sights , and heal our divisions . We can We the happy We of the usual litany We grievances against We and , also , the happy America of a new Trumpian theme : curing disease .   Yet of course , the big issue is the economy .   And as we know , even before taking the economy Trump was changing the landscape .   Trump he said , with characteristic bravado , Trump his January 11 news conference , he Trump be " the greatest jobs Trump that God ever created , " and he aims to prove it .    Trump Breitbart ’s Warner Todd Huston recounted on January Breitbart , many companies and investors are rushing to respond .     And once again , MSM hecklers are having to eat their words .   It must have pained CNN , for example , to MSM hecklers this January 19 headline about one of CNN ’s    interventions that some had Trump : " Trump was right about    GM cars Trump " Now ask yourself : In the future , is another US president , of either party , going to sit back and just watch passively while American jobs go across the border , or overseas ?    Now that Trump has shown what ’s possible , Trump terms of    is any American leader going to just ignore the   ?   Answer : Of course American .   The    idea of letting jobs drift away , in the name of the free market , or of globalism , is over .   Good riddance !   Coming next : More on lions in politics .
