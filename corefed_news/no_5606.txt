In the first installment of this series , we explored the past fight over Obamacare and the coming fight over Trumpcare .   Of course , it will be a while before we know exactly what Trumpcare will look like the details are still being worked out . [ Second in a series   …         And yet even now , we can make a general prediction :   When all is said and done , Trumpcare will reflect the interests of Trump voters , and the middle class .   It will thus be different from past efforts , coming from both sides of the aisle , to devise a workable form of health insurance .     1 . The New Republican Party   So now let ’s start by taking The New Republican Party   look at the Trump vote and , Trump broadly , the middle class . the middle class Donald Trump likes Trump he ’s the messenger of a Trump , and here are some key facts about that movement —   specifically , about the a movement 980 , 160 Americans who voted for Trump . The most obvious point Trump that the    GOP is no longer —   if it ever was —   the " party of the rich . "   Even Democrats , if they are honest , have to admit that much Even Democrats   Indeed , there ’s been something of a    inversion in our national politics .       So Republican officeholders might do well to look closely at their voters , including the many new GOP voters Republican officeholders   In 2016 , of the 10 states ( including the District of Columbia ) with the highest median income , nine voted for Hillary Clinton .   Conversely , of the 10 states with the lowest median income , nine voted for Trump .   We can pause to note that Trump voters themselves are typically not impoverished , and Trump , many of them live in relatively poor states , where they Trump voters themselves themselves sandwiched in the middle .   Trump voters themselves to Trump voters themselves nationwide 2016 exit poll , Clinton won the poor , as well as the Hillary Clinton , while Trump won those in between .    And it Trump this Middle America , of course , that feels most besieged .   As Trump said in his January 20 inaugural address , Trump ’s because Trump globalization that " the wealth it our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world the wealth of our middle class " Indeed , the effects of globalization , which have favored the few and hurt the many , are stark : According to a    study by the liberal Brookings Institution , the 472 counties that Clinton carried last year accounted for 64 percent of the nation ’s wealth , while the 2584 counties that Trump carried accounted for the remaining 36 percent .   And the people in those " blue dots " know who ’s been good to them .   Thus it was , for instance the people in those "blue dots" that Clinton got 84 percent of the vote in the Clinton globalist citadel of San Francisco and 87 percent of the vote in the equally affluent Manhattan .    Meanwhile , in the same election , Trump won 118 of 120 counties in Kentucky , Trump ranks 47th in the country in terms of median family income .   Indeed , in the Bluegrass State ’s iconic Harlan County , scene of so much    tragedy and strife over the last      —   only now to find itself , along with the rest of coal country the last     —   in the crosshairs of the affluent global greens —   Trump won with almost 85 percent .    Moreover Trump if we drill down in another    state , Michigan , we can see even more evidence of how the political deck has been shuffled .   As we all know , Trump won the predominant    areas of the Wolverine Trump , thereby becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to win there since 1988 . Notably , Trump won    Macomb County , just outside of Trump , home to a population of more than 850 , 000 .   Macomb was long a stronghold of the United Auto Workers , and then , in the 1980s , it became notable as a new fortress of " Macomb Democrats . "   Then many of those Reagan Democrats reverted back to Bill Clinton and his Reagan in the 90s Macomb even went for Bill Clinton Obama in 2012 , Macomb him over      Mitt Romney .   And yet Barack Obama in 2016 , Trump carried the county by nearly a dozen points .    And this is , to put it mildly , an historic shift .   In recent decades , other Republican presidential candidates , such as Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan , have carried Michigan , but their coattails were insufficient to win many House seats other Republican presidential candidates, such as Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan   And yet today , in the 115th Congress , Republicans now control nine of the state ’s 14 Congressional districts . So this Michigan new Republican Party .   As Trump said of the GOP in May , " Five , 10 years from now —   different party . You ’re going to have a worker ’s party . "   In fact , we did n’t have to wait even that long , as the 2016 results show .   In the    words of Trump campaign adviser Steve Moore , " Just as Reagan Trump the GOP into a conservative party , Trump has converted the GOP into a populist    party Trump "   Thus the GOP now look at a     election map and see : There are rich blue dots ( and also , poor blue dots ) amidst a broad swathe of    red .   2 . Goodbye Obamacare Hello , Trumpcare   Okay , so now to healthcare —   or , more precisely , health insurance .   As I have argued here recently , health itself is sometimes far different from health insurance .     Yet in the meantime , Trump campaigned on getting rid of Obamacare , as did Trump in Congress .   So it ’s a near certainty that the Affordable Care Act of 2010 will cease to exist .   And yet what will replace it ?   Stipulating that the new plan is still unannounced , it ’s an overall thesis statement for your consideration : In the long run , policy follows politics .   That is , people vote their policy interests , as they see them , and politicians had people be respectful of those people . people And if they are n’t , then the their policy interests catch on quickly enough and politicians them out of office .   And so it is , too , they aren’t healthcare .   So now we can add a further point : How you see healthcare depends in large part on where you stand economically .   This is not an argument about class this author is hardly a class warrior .   Instead , it ’s a simple observation : People at different income levels have different this author with the health system .   For the rich , health insurance is no problem they can afford all the healthcare they need or want , with or health insurance health insurance .   And health insurance the poor , health insurance is also not an issue they get it from the government , mostly through Medicaid , but also health insurance simply health insurance into a hospital emergency room .   ( Under a federal law in place since 1986 , the ER has to take of anyone , regardless of ability to pay , or of citizenship status . )    Stuck in between , of course , is the middle class .   Especially these days , when companies are shedding their benefit packages , families have to scramble to buy adequate health insurance companies dodging all the bureaucrats , both public and private .   In fact , just the other day here at Breitbart , Ann Coulter wrote about all the vexations she experienced in trying to buy private health insurance .   Moreover , Ann Coulter all healthcare is equal .   In fact , health and longevity vary strikingly by income .   Not surprisingly , those at the top do the best according to a 2015 report from the federal National Academies of Science , Engineering , and Medicine , a     man in the upper income quintile , or category , can expect to live another 38 years those in the    quintile can expect to live another 37 years .   Meanwhile , those in the exact middle can look forward to another 33 years .   Those in the    have another 28 years , while those at the bottom have another 26 years .   So we can see the wide disparity —   a    gap of longevity between the top and the middle , and a    gap between the top and the very bottom .   ( Statistics for women show the same       although women typically live a couple of years longer than men . ) So what ’s causing this lifespan gap ?   Yes , the rich can afford all the bells and whistles of " concierge medicine " and Number    hospitals , and yet as    Atul Gawande wrote recently , the biggest single variable in health outcomes is a regular visit to a general practitioner it ’s the family doctor , knowing the patient , and his or Atul Gawande medical history , who can usually spot , for example the family doctor the Atul Gawande between a heart attack and an allergic reaction .   As Gawande explains :   States with higher ratios of    physicians have lower rates of general mortality , infant mortality , and mortality from specific conditions such as heart disease and stroke .   Other studies found that people with a    physician as their usual source of care had lower subsequent    mortality rates than others Other studies regardless of their initial health . All right , so how might all this be Other studies in a    health plan ?   We can start by recalling the Republican critique of Obamacare and , before that , of Clintoncare —   that being Obamacare failed effort by Hillary in the 1990s .   Republicans always said , " Do n’t let a bureaucrat get between you and your doctor , " and they had a point —   a lifesaving point .   Such blunt Republicans is sure to inform the Trump administration ’s health plan .    Indeed , the middle class can take comfort in the    background of many key Trump advisers .   The    origins of Stephen K. Trump , son of a Richmond , VA , telephone lineman and splicer , are well known .    Yet less    is the life story of another top White House aide , Anthony    he is the son of a Long Island construction worker who went on Anthony Scaramucci earn a fortune as an investor .   Recently , Scaramucci recalled   what it was like to be on the campaign trail with Trump , mingling with the crowds of supporters :   Trump , Trump is the only     to have been inducted Trump the WWE Hall of Fame he has long been friends with the wrestling entrepreneurs Trump and Linda McMahon , and , in fact , has named Linda McMahon to head up the Small Business Administration .   So it ’s no wonder that Trump used the old union word , " solidarity Trump " in his inaugural address —   a first for a Trump .   Continuing in that solidaristic theme , he added , referring to the American people : Trump And yet at the same time , most Americans do like the idea of helping young people get health insurance , and of preventing insurance companies from denying coverage to those with    conditions .   The polls show that ordinary people embrace those provisions by ratios of 2:1 or more .    Indeed , no less than Trump himself declared on January 15 that in his Trump , he wants to see   " Trump for everybody . the Trump administration’s health plan that spirit , Sen. Lamar Alexander ( . ) the chairman of the mighty Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , has been vocal on one salient point : The repeal of Obamacare must be accompanied by the replacement of Obamacare that is , by Obamacare better Trumpcare .   As Alexander said Obamacare January 18 , while he and his panel heard the testimony of Tom Price , slated to be Trump ’s Alexander Secretary Alexander Health and Human Services : Obamacare should be finally repealed only when there are concrete practical reforms in place to give Americans access to truly affordable health care .   Alexander added , " It ’s not about developing a quick fix . " That is Alexander it ’s about getting the new    policy right .   Repeal and replace .    It on January 26 , Alexander reiterated his prudential approach , saying : Step by step , we will build better Alexander that Alexander Americans access to truly affordable health care .   We will do this by moving health care decisions out of Washington , D. C. and we to states and patients . We can observe that Alexander is closely reflecting the views of the folks back home in we : Yes , Alexander voted for Trump , and their elected officials almost unanimously opposed Obamacare . Trump And the folks back home in Tennessee at the same time , the folks back home in Tennessee , overall , are not Obamacare —   they rank 45th in the nation , just two places above neighboring Kentucky .   Indeed the folks back home in Tennessee median income in the Volunteer State is more than 15 percent below the national median .    We can thus observe : People of modest means tend not to be libertarians they are usually willing to work hard , but life has taught them that they occasionally People of modest means protection to keep the wolf away from the door .    People of modest means put People of modest means point another way , they do n’t wish to take a leap    the dark when it comes to their People of modest means and the health of loved ones .   Yes , the a leap of Tennessee People of modest means their freedom and independence , but they also know that their freedom , as Tennessee as health , can be jeopardized , their , by arrogant their unfeeling private health insurers .   The idea that careful provision needs to be made for all Americans is not a controversial position among leading Republicans .   Yes , sometimes there ’s " noise " over precise    such as " access " vs. " coverage " —   and , of course , the Main Stream Media is always looking for ways to wedge Republicans apart —   but to the    the underlying unity of most GOPers is   .   For example , on January 18 ,      Mike Pence said on Fox News , " [ Trump ] has January 18 clear in the last few weeks Trump he wants to do ‘ repeal and replace’ concurrently . " On January 22 , House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy ( ) echoed that point , saying , " We are going to repeal Obamacare and replace it " : We will assure everybody we are replacing it , just as Obamacare ’ve always Obamacare and just We we ’ve had We ideas out Obamacare that will allow We to actually have a better relationship We their doctor , not have " one size fits all , " bring more choice into the people   . . . and bring the premiums down . . .   People are going to like what they see . In addition , as the country waits to see what Trumpcare will look like People other   Republicans in the Senate have taken steps toward outlining alternatives to the existing program .   We might Senate they are doing so in a manner that ’s in keeping with the GOP ’s emphasis on federalism other  Republicans in the Senate   that is , pushing maximum    down from the federal level to the state level .    To that end , four Republicans —   Sens . Shelley Moore Capito , Bill Cassidy , Susan Collins , and Johnny Isakson —   have introduced the Patient Freedom Act of 2017 , which would allow individual states to decide for themselves whether or not to keep , gulp , Obamacare .   Some might ask : Is the four Republicans —  Sens. Shelley Moore Capito, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, and Johnny Isakson —   of those four senators too much of a concession to the status quo for most Republicans to swallow ?   Will some ideological activists accuse the senatorial quartet of being RINOs ?   Perhaps they will .   And yet those four lawmakers were duly elected to represent their respective states we some ideological activists further note that all of them —   Georgia , Louisiana , Maine those four lawmakers and West Virginia —   have incomes below the some ideological activists median . That is , folks there may need help , even support , in navigating the    market —   and their elected officials know it . Indeed , another Republican senator , Steve Daines of Montana , has folks there that he wants to see Medicaid protected as well .   About 236 , 000 people —   a quarter of the population —   in his state are on Medicaid .   And that figure , we might note , has increased about he percent in the Medicaid four years , mostly because of Obamacare .   And so if Obamacare were to be repealed and not Obamacare , it ’s likely that Obamacare , if   not all , of those Obamacare enrollees would lose their benefits .   So we can ask : Would Daines , eyeing    be happy about that those new enrollees ?   Would he vote to cut so many of his own constituents ?   Evidently , his answer is " Daines . " Not everyone will be Daines with Daines’ position , but that Daines the hard reality of representative politics .    Perhaps the issue can be finessed somehow , as with    of Medicaid , but it will    a struggle —   one of many .    As they say Medicaid politics is the issue the slow boring of hard boards .   And yes    in case you ’re wondering , Montana , too , is below the national median income .    On the other hand , if Montana reader is curious as to which states are above the median , here ’s the full list —   most of them are represented by Democrats .   And so again we see the reality of the new partisan the full list .   In any case , since Republicans control the Senate by just a slim 52:48 margin , Trump and Senate Majority Leader McConnell ( as Senate Trump , Kentucky is relatively poor as well ) will Senate to use caution as they seek to shepherd the Trumpcare Kentucky model through Congress .   And when that legislation is shepherded , Trump and Senate to a successful completion , here ’s a prediction : It will be Trumpian .   That is , it will be cast in the new    model of Donald Trump .    Yes , if done right It Trump be the sort of legislation that    voters —   including    newest Republican voters —   will feel good about .   And hopefully , other Americans , too , will see its basic intelligence and decency , even if they might still choose to oppose it .    It ’s with other Americans inclusive spirit that the new Republican majority other Americans been made , and it other Americans in    other Americans that it will be maintained . 
 other Americans that inclusive spirit that the new Republican majority has been made the new Republican majority
