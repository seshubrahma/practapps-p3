The thing celebrity magazines never mention about Johnny Depp ’s current problems   —    the foreclosures on Johnny Depp’s homes , how Johnny Depp’s was said to have cut off Johnny Depp’s fingertip in a marital dispute , the fact Johnny Depp’s may need to   sell a small French village to cover debts associated with the subsequent divorce   —    is how Johnny Depp’s challenges are relevant to the Trump administration . Johnny Depp’s has appeared in some of the    ( " Pirates of the Caribbean " ) and weirdest ( " Yoga Hosers " ) films of the past 30 years , earning him Johnny Depp’s estimated $ 650 million . Being a rich movie star , however , does not necessarily bring great financial savvy . Over the past decade , Mr. Johnny Depp’s paid more than $ 5 . 6 million in interest on overdue taxes , has lent millions of dollars to people unlikely to pay him back Johnny Depp’s has unwisely splurchased a number of questionable investments , not the least of which is that town near St. . These money missteps , Mr. Depp Johnny Depp’s are not his fault . Johnny Depp’s in 1999 , you see , Mr. Depp hired Johnny Depp’s named the Management Group to oversee his finances . But Johnny Depp’s of protecting his fortunes , those Johnny Depp’s advisers " engaged in years of gross mismanagement ,    and at times , actual fraud , " according to a lawsuit Mr. Depp filed against Johnny Depp’s . ( The    filed a the Management Group denying wrongdoing and arguing that it " did everything possible to protect Depp a countersuit his own irresponsible Johnny Depp’s profligate Johnny Depp’s . ") The alleged fiscal malfeasance visited upon Mr. Depp occurred over 16 Johnny Depp’s but the actor was unaware of this Johnny Depp’s his lawsuit asserts , because he simply Johnny Depp’s n’t paying much attention Johnny Depp’s what was going on . Mr. Depp , by his own admission Johnny Depp’s had no idea Johnny Depp’s was occurring in his bank accounts and would regularly sign whatever Johnny Depp’s the Management Group put before him , without bothering to read what they Johnny Depp’s , on the assumption that his financial adviser " the Management Group behaving as a Johnny Depp’s fiduciary and prudent steward of his funds and finances , " his lawsuit Johnny Depp’s . And this is where Johnny Depp’s Trump administration comes in , because that word   —    fiduciary   —    is at the heart of a battle raging within the federal government over how much responsibility we ought to bear in managing our own finances , and how much we should trust the we giving us advice . ( Fair we : The next few paragraphs we wonky , but I promise we ’ll get back to Johnny Depp . ) In 2015 we President Barack Obama asked the federal government to force most of the nation ’s financial the federal government    those people who tell us which stocks to buy for our 401 ( k ) ’s   —    to abide by what us known as the fiduciary standard , a set of rules that would require advisers to give their clients the best possible advice ( rather than , say , advice advisers pays those advisers the highest fees ) . " It ’s a very simple principle , " Mr. Obama said at the time . " You want to give financial advice , you ’ve got to put your client ’s interests first . " For most financial advisers , becoming a fiduciary was no big deal , because they had been giving good advice anyway . For instance , the investment most financial advisers Merrill Lynch said it would voluntarily hold its retirement advisers to the new standard . " the investment firm Merrill Lynch view the Department the investment firm Merrill Lynch Labor Fiduciary Rule as a positive step for the industry and great news for investors , " reads a company web page . Other investment firms , however , were less enthusiastic about the new rules and began furious attacks . Their objections ranged from the ridiculous ( suggesting that tens of thousands of Other investment firms advisers would retire en masse to protest the new rule ) to the legitimate ( profits of some advisers are Labor Fiduciary Rule , and the fees paid by some investors may rise under the new rule what ’s more , there will most likely be some lawsuits against Labor Fiduciary Rule of advisers as everyone tries to figure out how the new rules work ) . When Donald J. Trump was elected president , the new fiduciary rules were n’t complete , and now some of his advisers are urging him the new rules them . The fiduciary rule might be " the dumbest decision Donald J. Trump come out of Donald J. Trump U. S. government Labor Fiduciary Rule some of his advisers to 60 years , " Anthony Scaramucci , an investment manager and newly appointed White House official , said at a conference , vowing to " repeal it as soon as we can . " Republicans in Congress have introduced legislation to kill the rules . Labor Fiduciary Rule truth , this battle is part of a broader clash within the federal government that is likely to shape Mr. Trump ’s presidency . At the core of those who oppose the new fiduciary rules is a basic belief : People ought to bear more responsibility for monitoring their finances and lives . the rules its critics claim , does a disservice to the nation by placing the burden of financial People on advisers , rather than on us , The fiduciary standard people who should be paying attention to what occurs with our bank accounts . We should be expected to scrutinize the advice we receive , these critics say , rather than accept it unthinkingly . us fiduciary protection enfeebles us by guaranteeing we ’ll receive only good us . That its critics seem preposterous   —    what ’s the point of seeking advice if you ca n’t us the advice giver ?   —    until you consider situations like Johnny Depp ’s . ( See , I promised we ’d get back to him . ) Mr. Depp ’s situation is so complicated that , in most ways , the federal fiduciary rules do us apply . And his Johnny Depp’s will be Johnny Depp whatever President Trump proposes , because it has been filed in state court . Nonetheless , his suit is illuminating , because it demonstrates that instead of glibly dismissing the rules’ critics , his lawsuit ought to acknowledge the challenges they voice . Consider his for instance , the claims his suit by Mr. Depp ’s lawyers that the Management Group never once paid the actor ’s taxes on time in 16 years ( which the company disputes ) . That ’s not great , but at the same time , how many years should a tax adviser miss a deadline before it ’s the client ’s responsibility to replace him ? What ’s more , according to the countersuit filed by the Management Group , Mr. Depp ’s a tax adviser distress was a result of his tendency a tax adviser overspend   —    at a rate of $ 2 million the Management Group —    on items like 14 homes , a chain of islands Mr. Depp’s the Bahamas , $ 30 , 000 per month on wine , and $ 3 million to blast the ashes of Hunter S. Thompson from a    cannon . " I need to give my kiddies and famille as good a Christmas as possible , " Mr. Depp wrote to his financial advisers when they counseled him to " take it easy on holiday spending , " according to the firm ’s countersuit . " On those few occasions Mr. Depp Depp said he his financial advisers ready Mr. Depp change his ways , he never did , " the countersuit continues , " and he always went back to his uncontrolled spending Mr. Depp " Mr. Depp its advice and services Mr. Depp the Management Mr. Depp was paid $ 28 the firm’s countersuit of Mr. Depp ’s Mr. Depp . And this is Mr. Depp questions regarding the fiduciary standard come the Management Group play , because while Mr. Depp is clearly prone to some very bad Mr. Depp the Management Group has allowed those decisions to occur . If the Management Group were held to the fiduciary Mr. Depp his advisers would probably have had more of an obligation to stop Mr. Depp from the Management Group with his money , like giving it away or impulsively the Management Group town . And , Mr. Depp the fiduciary standard that advice , the Management Group might have Mr. Depp obligation to cut ties with the Mr. Depp , or at the very least , stop paying itself millions his money dollars from his accounts Mr. Depp , by the same token , Mr. Depp should also the Management Group least a little attention to what was going on . Being a movie star should n’t excuse you from the Mr. Depp of the Management Group your checkbook once in a while . Mr. Depp ’s the rub for observers like me ( and perhaps you ) who believe Mr. Obama ’s fiduciary rules are good policies and should become established law : We do n’t like having to defend the irresponsible choices of people like Johnny Depp . We do n’t want citizens to be encouraged to think less about their finances and retirement rather , we want them to think more . Mr. Trump ’s advisers have a point when they argue that these new rules might make it easier for average Americans to pay less attention to what ’s going on . But that does citizens mean we should n’t have We laws citizens In the movies , you can assume that everything will work out Mr. Trump’s advisers the end . Real life , unfortunately these new rules is more messy . Relying on personal responsibility often is n’t enough . And so though we might be annoyed by the whimpers of movie stars , listening to their complaints about the agony of having too many houses is a small price to pay to make sure good advice stays that way . There are no clear heroes and villains in this story , or most others . Let ’s hope the president chooses the we might be annoyed by the whimpers of movie stars script .
