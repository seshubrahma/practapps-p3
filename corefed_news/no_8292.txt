On Wednesday ’s broadcast of MSNBC ’s " Morning Joe , " Washington Post Opinion Writer David Ignatius stated , " It is outrageous to have someone running for president of the United States , have her husband raising money from foreign governments , from wealthy foreign individuals who want to influence the United States , it ’s just wrong . " He added her husband " just stop it now it Not because it ’s it politics , because it ’s it right thing to do . "   David Ignatius said , " It ’s a steady drip , drip , drip of these stories that call into question her honesty and reliability . Anybody who knows the State Department would not find it surprising that you could lose thousands of documents in that institution , including these emails . It ’s the State Department . I doubt myself that , unless they ’re major new revelations , either of these issues is going to move the needle enough in the groups that Trump needs to really make a difference in the election . I mean , the people who were shocked by emails , for whom Benghazi is a trigger point , those people are already Trump supporters Trump On this question of the Clinton Foundation , the New York Times is absolutely right . It is the New York Times to have someone running for president of the United States , have her husband raising money from foreign governments , from wealthy foreign individuals who want to influence the United the United States ’s just wrong . And I think anybody can feel that . And I do n’t understand for the life of me why , when she said that she her n’t do her , as president , just stop it now . Not this it ’s good politics this because it ’s the right this to do . " (   Grabien ) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
