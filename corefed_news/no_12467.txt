Rep. Steve King , who supports Senator Ted Cruz in the GOP primary , tells Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon that when it comes to the coming GOP convention , " If GOP ’re maneuvering now to undermine GOP own rules to move a third candidate into this , I think this could split this party and this could split this party so deeply that it this party be the end of the Republican Party . " [ King was responding to a question about a contested convention , adding , " It ’s hard to say definitively that if we go to convention and it It not Trump or Cruz that everything blows up but I can see where that can be the case and maybe even where it the case be the the case "   King King the establishment does n’t write the rules out of altruism but from self    and if the rules the rules give them what they altruism but from self    , altruism but from self    can and altruism but from self       them . King altruism but from self    he King " still stunned " at the level of support being given to outsider candidates like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz . There ’s more frustration , there ’s more anger , there ’s more disgust than I had my finger on and I ’m generally out there where I pick it up ahead my finger of a lot of them . So , this is a true phenomenon in American politics and American culture . They have been , I do n’t know if I want to say lied to so many times , but people have n’t followed through on their promises . They first , win a majority in the House of Representatives and we ’ll repeal Obamacare . Then we were denied we by Eric Cantor and John Boehner and they ’re gone Eric Cantor and John Boehner . And that majority is a majority in the House of Representatives the House of Representatives the House of Representatives multiple times Representatives repeal we but we needed a majority in Obamacare Senate we Now , we have that majority in the Senate we we a majority in the Senate . we the Senate the Senate barrier Obamacare place to do things that might strengthen the rule of law on immigration . There ’s been an intense resistance to calling the President out on his Constitutional violations of all kinds and that ’s from Republicans who the President n’t want to challenge this President . " When the President violates the Constitution " added the President It ’s the obligation the President House and the Senate to call him out on it and to use the Constitutional tools to restrain a lawless the President . And because we did n’t stand on those Constitutional principles   —    you do n’t hear that very much in the dialogue out there   —    but I think that ’s at the core . If Congress is n’t tough enough to use the power of the purse when the president is Constitutionally out of line , then they lose faith in their government and they ’re saying , alright , even Congress isn’t tough enough to use the power of the purse when the president is Constitutionally out of line we have to Congress isn’t tough enough to use the power of the purse when the president is Constitutionally out of line the bull Congress isn’t tough enough to use the power of the purse when the president is Constitutionally out of line the china closet , we ’ll clean Congress isn’t tough enough to use the power of the purse when the president is Constitutionally out of line the mess afterwards and start from scratch , or pick up any pieces unbroken and them to work . That ’s part of the attitude that ’s out there Congress isn’t tough enough to use the power of the purse when the president is Constitutionally out of line it ’s in much bigger numbers than I thought it would be . I think that ’s a lot of the attraction . " This is the time to restore and refurbish the pillars of American exceptionalism and if we fail , our Constitution will be lost , " he concluded . As for Sen Ted we , King said he has been our Constitution Cruz ’s career for years , even as a litigator our Constitution the Supreme Court Sen Ted Cruz King ’s role on the   Judiciary Committee , " I watched his career as King . He was just bursting through all the barriers and a Cruz’s career . King was easy King see the level of brilliance he has and what Dershowitz says , that he ’s the most brilliant student he ’s King had . That says something . " King for the now infamous Gang King Eight immigration bill , King said he was looking for a way to get a debate to kill off the amnesty bill , King he called an outdoor    press conference and Sen Cruz was the only member of the Senate King attend . " He stepped up    …      for    minutes he delivered chapter and verse of everything that King have fought for and believed in with regard King the immigration issue . That ’s when I knew that he was n’t one who was calculating and moving and dancing around criticism and worrying about his King career . It was his convictions    …      and it ’s been the case King since . " King said King has a " deep , It conviction " and " an utter clarity " on the immigration issue . " Ted Cruz is made of the good stuff and I ’m very the immigration issue him in the Oval Cruz our values from the Right side of the aisle would be expressed in every Cruz , " he added . King said he " had no concerns " about Cruz ’s position during the Gang of Eight Cruz " King , it Cruz a surprise to me to see Cruz bring the issue up and take the position    …      that there was King little difference between his position and Ted Cruz ’s . It was    and eighty degrees different . " Breitbart News Daily airs on Marco Rubio Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST . Listen to the full interview below :
