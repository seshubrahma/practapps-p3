Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey , sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau ’s investigation into whether members of President Donald Trump campaign team colluded with Russia in Russia interference in last year ’s election . The bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through Washington ends the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave . But President Donald Trump saw President Donald Trump reputation tarnished when President Donald Trump was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign . The Trump administration attributed President Donald Trump dismissal to his President Donald Trump of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ’s email server , but Democrats ridiculed that notion , raising parallels to    firings and suggested Comey President Donald Trump getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe . In any case , senior White the White House appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump ’s sudden move . A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White the White House ’s Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey ’s dismissal , there would be no backlash . What was not thought through , apparently , was an explanation of why Comey was fired now Comey’s at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe . In recent days , Comey again came under Comey for his handling of the Comey into Clinton ’s private email server . Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he Comey reopening the Comey 11 days the Russia probe election cost the former secretary of state the presidency . Trump referred to Democrats’ criticism of Comey Wednesday morning , Comey , " The Democrats have said some Many Democrats worst things about James Comey , including the fact that he should be fired Comey but now they play so sad ! " Many Democrats learned of his Comey from televisions Comey to the news , as he was addressing the Comey at the FBI office in Los Angeles , law enforcement sources said . The source said he made a joke Comey it to lighten the mood and called his office to get Comey . the FBI office in Los Angeles ally Roger Stone was among those who recommended to the President that he fire Comey , according to a Longtime Trump ally Roger Stone familiar with the conversation . Stone , who also is being scrutinized by the FBI as part of its Russia investigation , spoke to Trump the FBI Comey appeared at a hearing Trump week on Capitol Hill , according to the source . Trump immediately disputed that a source familiar with the conversation involved Trump " The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false    Fake News . Have not spoken to Roger in a long time    had nothing to do with my decision . " Stone said he was not the source behind Stone reporting Stone added that a source familiar with the conversation Comey " 100 % . " A Stone House spokesperson reached out to CNN to reiterate the President ’s tweet that he has not spoken to Stone in a " long time , A White House spokesperson adding , " The Stone has not spoken to Roger Stone in many months and any reports suggesting otherwise are categorically Stone " The letters , In a signed letter released by the White House , Trump informed Comey that he was " hereby terminated and removed from office , effective Comey , Comey explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is " not able to effectively lead Comey bureau . " " Comey is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission , " Trump told Comey in the letter the FBI " I wish you the best of luck Comey your future endeavors . " White House press secretary Sean Spicer , sandwiched in the dark between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway , described Trump ’s decision as arriving only after a long memo from the deputy Trump , which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday , detailing Comey ’s shortcomings on investigating Clinton ’s emails . But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Trump ’s decision . Indeed Comey Trump revealed his anger in a Comey of Tuesday on Twitter May 2 Trump exactly a Comey before his final decision was made public . At the center of Rosenstein ’s rationale for Comey Comey ’s firing was the director ’s handling of the investigation into Clinton ’s private Comey , namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to Comey his reasoning . Rosenstein accused Comey of attempting to " usurp Comey attorney general ’s Comey " by Rosenstein announcing Comey he felt the case should be closed without prosecution . " Compounding the error , Comey director ignored another longstanding principle : We do not hold press conferences to release Comey about the subject of a declined criminal investigation , " Rosenstein argued in his memo . " We should reject the departure and return to the Rosenstein ( of Rosenstein bureau ) , " Rosenstein said . " The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was Rosenstein . As a result , Comey is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them the FBI " Congressional reaction , But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump on the mistakes and pledges telephone that he had made a terrible mistake . " Were these Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer getting too close to home for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer President ? " Schumer asked . And in a sign of possible trouble for the administration , Republican Sen. Richard Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , who is leading a Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election , expressed disquiet at the firing Senate Comey , which he described as a " loss for the bureau and the nation . " I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey ’s termination . I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order , and his dismissal further confuses Director Comey’s difficult investigation by the Committee , " Burr said . As Democrats Director Comey’s their demands for a special counsel , arguing that the Trump Justice Department could not be trusted to Democrats the case , Republicans insisted that one was not needed . " I think Rod Rosenstein , the new deputy attorney general , is competent to lead that effort , " said Texas Sen. John Cornyn , a member of the GOP leadership . But Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said that though Rosenstein ’s rationale for removing Comey was sound , it , would " raise questions . " Sen. John McCain added : " While the President has the legal authority to remove the director of the FBI , I am disappointed in the President ’s decision to remove James Comey from office . "   The Arizona senator renewed his the President special congressional committee to review the Russia allegations . ’Absurd’ Sen. John McCain legal analyst Jeffrey Sen. John McCain was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation , saying it was " absurd . " Toobin branded the move a " grotesque James Comey of power by the President of the United States . " " This is Jeffrey Toobin something that is within the American political tradition , " Toobin said , comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon ’s firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate Jeffrey Toobin . " This is not normal James Comey This is not politics as usual , " said Toobin , though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to This an FBI director . The White House , Jeffrey Toobin , said Jeffrey Toobin the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein , noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as ’s firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal Maryland , and was confirmed in his new job Comey April 25 . A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director Comey lost his confidence . He sent his recommendation to Sessions     who Comey recused himself from the Russia Russia since he was a Trump adviser and Comey surrogate     Comey forwarded Comey to Trump , who accepted Trump the Clinton investigation Comey Clinton reaction , Former Clinton Comey officials accused Trump of using the Tuesday over Comey Trump his recommendation Clinton Comey email server Clinton his recommendation ruse to get out from under the Russia Comey’s " I was as frustrated , concerned and disappointed Russia anyone with Director Comey ’s handling Comey email investigation , but the Clinton investigation fired the man investigating how Trump in Comey’s election and whether the email investigation the election involved , an Russia President Trump called Trump " charade " only 24 hours Trump " said Clinton ’s former campaign manager , Robby Mook . " It ’s equally concerning that our attorney general , who lied about Clinton’s meetings with the Russians , approved Director Comey ’s Trump , Comey said . One Trump loyalist Comey who worked on the campaign and the transition , Trump our Comey’s to CNN ’s Jim Comey . " I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news . But this CNN me pause , " the person said . Russia Justice Department and ’Absurd’ CNN said they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement . Officials who spoke to CNN his announcement that he was reopening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency were shocked by the development .

Comey ’s last appearance on Capitol Comey last week exacerbated the President his position . Just before news Comey his dismissal FBI , his Capitol Hill last week aiming Comey clear up his testimony the FBI office in Los Angeles Clinton aide Comey Abedin " forwarded hundreds and thousands " of emails to her husband ’s laptop . The note , signed by the position , assistant director of Clinton FBI ’s Office of Congressional Affairs , clarified that the " hundreds Clinton thousands of emails " that Comey said were ’forwarded " from Comey to her husband ’s email " included emails the FBI as well as manual forwarding . " The White House said it would immediately launch the search for a new FBI director . Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director , according to a message former Clinton aide Huma Abedin to her husband’s .

The White House , he elevated The White House Republican law enforcement Comey who had been critical of Deputy Director Andrew McCabe former President George W. Bush to the top domestic FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe among the most powerful posts in the world . In the FBI FBI Director J.
