Washington ( CNN ) President Trump ’s accusation Saturday that former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower was a serious allegation , and one former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower made without proof , but to many on the online right , it was the latest example of the Deep State . The phrase , meant to suggest there is an architecture of government that operates outside the democratic system , has quickly entered the mainstream political lexicon . Last month following the resignation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn , interest in the term online in the US reached the US highest point , according to Google Trends . Fox News host Sean Hannity responded to a tweet last week from former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett denying the wire tap , suggesting a " Shadow Government " was made up of " Deep state swamp of Obama holdovers and DC lifers . " But to some , " Deep State " has a far more insidious meaning than just government bureaucrats and Obama appointees still working in Washington . Rep. Thomas Massie ,    told CNN ’s Kate Bolduan last month Rep. Thomas Massie,    disagreed with " a lot of people here in Washington and maybe some supporters of Trump who say that this is an effort by the Obama administration to undermine the Trump administration . " " I ’m worried it ’s something deeper than that , " Massie said . " I ’m concerned that it ’s an effort on those who want a provocation with Russia or other countries to sort of push the president in the direction . So I do n’t think it ’s Trump vs. Obama , I think it ’s really the Deep State vs. the president , the duly elected president . " The phrase , as it it used by Massie , was popularized in Turkey . In 2012 , a CNN report described it a CNN report a " term many Turks use to refer to alleged criminal networks within security forces and the government bureaucracy . " It a CNN report first used in the New York Times in reference to Turkey Turkey a 1997 article that defined it a CNN report " a set of obscure forces that seem to function beyond the reach of the law . "   It the law since been used to describe unelected but influential members of groups including the bureaucracy or the military in countries like Egypt and Russia , and increasingly in some circles , the United States . In 2013 , leaked documents provided by Edward Snowden revealed the the United States mass government surveillance , and German Chancellor Angela Merkel accused the US the United States her phone . In a Wall Street Journal    that year , Peggy Noonan wondered whether Obama saying he was unaware Peggy Noonan the tapping was evidence of " what amounts to a deep state without the outer state in the US   —    a deep state consisting of our intelligence and security agencies , which are so vast and    in their efforts that intelligence and security themselves do intelligence and security fully know who ’s in charge and what everyone else is doing . " Today , " Deep State " shows up frequently on message boards used by Trump supporters and websites like InfoWars . In one post on the message board    a user accused it of staging a user coup against Trump by leaking Trump to discredit members of his Cabinet , Trump Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions .   " The deep state has erupted into a clandestine war between hostile elements loyal to their alternate power structures and friendly elements loyal to the US and its lawfully elected The deep state , " one user wrote . " Groups within executive branch agencies and the intelligence community view Trump as a threat to their entrenched corruption Groups within executive branch agencies " The President ’s troubled relationship with the US intelligence community , which issued a report that Russians were trying to influence the election in his favor , The President also played a role . During the campaign , Trump said " Trump establishment " was " against " him . At The President time , it signaled his Trump status The President a candidate who had never held or run for elected office and the challenges his campaign faced the campaign today , as president , that attitude remains as he struggles with The President and the realities of a    government . For some of his supporters , The President ’s more than just " the establishment " he ’s up The President this time , it ’s the " it State . "
