" I have made no such determination . What I have    determined is that based upon the unique circumstances , the    public interest requires me to place this the investigation the    authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from    the normal chain of command . " ’ "    Multiple government bodies have been conducting inquiries into    Russia ’s meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and    potential instances of collusion between the Kremlin and Trump    associates . The FBI ’s investigation is now completely in the    hands of Mueller , who led the bureau for 12 years under    Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama .
