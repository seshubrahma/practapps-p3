Veteran pollster Pat Caddell thinks the nation is at " the tipping point " of political " revolution " in the 2016 election because the Washington establishment does n’t understand the legitimate concerns motivating ordinary Americans . Veteran pollster Pat Caddell believes the Washington establishment " empire is trying to strike back " against the populist movement challenging their power , but the American people have " left the building . " [ Veteran pollster Pat Caddell explained to Breitbart News Daily host and Breitbart Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon that the rise of candidates like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders reflects the sentiment of the majority of Americans " who feel the country is in decline , who feel that they Breitbart News Daily host and Breitbart Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon getting screwed , their Breitbart News Daily host and Breitbart Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon ’s futures are at stake , and nobody gives a damn about it in Washington , which they ’re correct [ about ] and the things that they they in are mocked and ignored . This is the makings of a Jacksonian Revolution . "   Caddell said the establishment is not going to " give up power easily . " However , " for the the establishment understand how to take Trump seriously , they would However, "for the establishment to understand how to take Trump seriously to understand what his voters Trump about , and since they can However, "for the establishment to understand how to take Trump seriously recognize the legitimacy of those claims   …      it ’s impossible for them to calculate the figure of the threat coming . Now they see them , and now the empire is trying to strike back . " The political establishment of both parties " have a mistaken view that the American people are here to serve them   the American people      as opposed to their job the American people to be the servants of the people , " Caddell said . " They ’ve the American people this relationship backwards , and they ’ve the American people running Washington and politics and corruption of unimaginable proportions to their benefit the American people And what ’s happening is the American people want their sovereignty the American people . " " This country will not go gently into that good night of decline , " Caddell asserted Caddell " I listened to the debate that Trump was n’t at , and even with Ted Cruz and [ Ben ] Carson , all the sudden they were all back talking about establishment things , " Caddell noting Caddell adding that the role of the American people in that debate was " to shut up , vote our way , and do n’t get in our way our " Bannon interjected in agreement , saying , " This is why people have dialed out of politics . It ’s This dryness and thinness of the political dialogue . They talk about all these issues that , yes , are all important , but they ’re They vital . But when you talk about building a wall to stop illegal immigration , when you talk about bringing ten million jobs back from China , which is emblematic of how we ’ve gutted this country China trade deals , when you talk about a temporary ban on Muslims   —    [ Trump ’s ] basic themes have been to drive the narrative back to things that matter to working class people in this country . China said that whether you agree with Trump ’s positions or not , he is raising " Caddell most vital questions . " " And it ’s not that immigration may be the most vital , but nonetheless , his argument about it Caddell : You either have a country or you do n’t , " Caddell said . " Caddell if you do n’t like what he ’s saying   Caddell      or agree with his solutions , for Caddell Americans that ’s a pretty hard thing not to agree with . " " Same thing on the [ temporary ] Muslim ban , " Caddell added . " Caddell do n’t agree with that . But he is touching a Caddell and saying , ‘ We have no security , we do n’t know We to control this , we ’re so PC We and we are making our We vulnerable.’ And We issue of security in America is really high . " Caddell noted that when Caddell says , " Nobody owns me I ’m paying for this campaign , " he is addressing the Caddell unspoken " issue of corruption in American politics , which , along with the economy and national security , is one of the top three issues for voters . " You ’ve got    percent of the American people who believe flat out that both political parties have failed economically and that we need a different approach , " Caddell said . " We have had this pantomime   —    this kabuki theater of politics for too long , and now people are worried . And they ’ve been worried people but now they ’ve decided to people something about it . " Bannon asked , " Do you believe we are at a tipping point of revolutionary times ? " Caddell said , " Caddell , we are , and we tipping point is the American people being willing to overthrow their leadership through the the American people process . And then if that does n’t work and they manage to be the American people out of that , then that will not go over well . " " There is a warning here and it ’s from 1860 , " he said , referencing the 1860 presidential election when multiple political parties ran candidates . Caddell closed by saying , " All of what I ’m saying summed up is this country is in revolution , " and " the establishment will not deal with the fact or give credibility [ to the concerns ] . When they attack Trump the way they do with the they viciousness and stuff   …      what they ’re saying to they American people is : ‘ This is you . Get back in your box.’ And they the American people left the they , folks . " " All of you   —    you people have left the American people , " Caddell the building Bannon and the Breitbart News Daily audience . " Your audience   —    ask them today .
