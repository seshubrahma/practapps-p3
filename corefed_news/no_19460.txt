’   ’ "    One prognostication I ’ve been seeing a lot is that Donald Trump    will start Donald Trump    administration with a burst of fiscal stimulus : a    big tax cut , an increase in defense spending , an infrastructure    spending package . " "    And I ’ve seen some Donald Trump    opponents   that whatever the    merits of such a    policy , it would likely boost the economy in the short run and    therefore allow Donald Trump    to start his administration with high    popularity . " "    But I do n’t think we should assume a Donald Trump    fiscal stimulus would    be effective in stimulating the the economy " ’    Often , debates over fiscal policy feel as if they are debates over fiscal policy in    2009 or 2011 . Liberals got used to arguing that larger government    deficits would boost an economy that was awash in idle capital    and labor just waiting to be put to work because that was the    situation at the time . ’ ’    I think they were right at the time . ’ "    But even if an additional stimulus package would have been a good    idea in 2011 , that does n’t mean such a package would grow the    economy in Trump ’s America . " "    The American economy is approaching full employment . Interest    rates remain low , but they have Interest   rates sharply since Trump ’s Trump election : The    Treasury bond yield has gone from 1 . 86 % on    Election Day to 2 . 33 % as of Monday . " ’    Because of limited slack in the economy , a large fiscal stimulus    today could actually have the effects that conservatives    incorrectly warned of in 2009 : higher government borrowing costs ,    a crowding out of useful    projects due to higher    interest rates , and inflation . ’ ’    A Trump stimulus would also likely be offset by Federal Reserve    action : the Fed could be expected to accelerate its interest the Fed    increases to stop inflation , and those higher rates would further    crowd out private investment , preventing the economy from    overheating    ’ ’    Of course , Trump could Trump to pressure the Fed the Fed tightening ,    he does Trump directly control its actions . the Fed    Republicans in Congress have an ideological commitment to hawkish    Fed policy the Fed be unlikely to look kindly on a Trump effort Trump to pack the Federal Reserve Board with money printers . ’ "    And if Trump succeeded Trump pressuring the Fed to allow the Fed    to overheat , then you could really expect inflation   —    which    would n’t be popular with the retirees whose votes put Trump over Trump the top in the election . " ’   ’ "    It ’s worth thinking about the recent history of deficit politics    in the United States and how it could be misleading us It " ’    In his warning that Democrats should avoid working with Trump on Trump infrastructure , Jonathan Chait   deficit fights as a false morality    play , where Republicans open the spigots when they run the    government Republicans take credit for economic growth , and then force    Democrats into painful austerity later . ’ ’    This is correct in regard the    history , but it misses a    lesson This the 1980s and 1990s that may prove relevant in a    Trump administration . ’ "    There was a time when    deficits caused high interest    rates , which were    . This meant cutting deficits was n’t    just an exercise in making your constituents hate you and     like you . If you cut the    deficit , interest rates went down , and that made it easier for    businesses interest rates invest and    to pay their bills . " ’ businesses So in 1993 , President Bill Clinton sought and signed a      package from the Democratic Congress   —    no    hysterical Republican warnings needed . ’ "    In 1990 , President George H. W. Bush agreed on a deficit reduction    package with Democrats in Congress . This law was unpopular with    many Republicans because it raised taxes after Bush This law    not to President George H. W. Bush taxes , but Republicans’ preferred alternative    policy was an        , not higher deficits . " "    What ’s changed in the intervening years was that interest rates    remained low . So even though there were large government deficits    in some years , these did not impose a significant drag on the    economy . Calls for deficit reduction were all politics because    during this period there was not a strong policy reason to cut    the deficit . " "    But that need not be true forever , and a large burst of deficit    spending not prompted by an actual economic downturn would be    exactly the sort of policy you would need to bring the        ’   era to a close . " "    Of course , the budget deficit is not the deficit in which fiscal    policy affects the economy , and Trump ’s policies could grow the    economy through other channels . the economy he could implement    tax cuts that       ’ specifically designed to encourage investment    and work , or he could build infrastructure that grows the       ’ productive capacity of the economy . " ’    I am skeptical the economy will deliver a lot in the      growth area Trump’s though I do think one of his major policies   —    a cut    in Trump’s corporate income tax rate   —    would be        whatever its distributive merits . ’ "    But when thinking        whether Trump is likely to enter office    with a    Trump’s in growth , the key is to remember these      matters are for the long run : Lower corporate income    taxes could encourage corporate investments that make the company    gradually more productive over years and decades , but they wo n’t    do much to boost next quarter Lower corporate income    GDP growth number .
