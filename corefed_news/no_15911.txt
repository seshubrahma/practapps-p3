Washington   ( CNN ) President Donald Trump ’s decision to delegate authority over troop levels in Afghanistan has been lauded by those who feel he ’s correcting Obama administration overreach , even as Obama administration raises concerns that he may be ceding too much civilian control of the military . Defense Secretary James Mattis announced Thursday that Trump had given Defense Secretary James Mattis authority over Afghanistan troop levels , a little more than a month after the President had given Defense Secretary James Mattis control over the number of US soldiers operating in Syria and Iraq . Defense Secretary James Mattis is expected to send some 3 , 000 to 5 , 000 additional troops to Afghanistan .   Former defense officials say civilian oversight of the military is not just an important check in a healthy democracy , the military ensures that larger strategic considerations are taken into account     while others question whether the Trump administration has a broader strategy at all . Former officials also stressed that even if a president delegates some decisions , there ’s no avoiding the fact that ultimate responsibility rests with the    .   " I think it ’s important that he give troop number responsibility to Secretary Mattis , but not the decision , because to put more troops in after a long period of decreasing is a policy change for America , " retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal , a commander of US troops and International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan , told CNN .   " It is deciding we ’re going to push the clock further , we are going to stay involved longer , we are going to engage the American people and the Afghan people . That ’s a presidential level decision that he has to own , " McChrystal said of Trump .    Mattis told lawmakers Thursday that the President had delegated he the authority " to turn the numbers up and down as necessary " after months of discussion . Sen. Lindsey Graham , a South Carolina Republican , said Mattis wanted to " congratulate the President for having the vision and , quite frankly , good judgment to allow Mattis in consultation with a very good military leadership team to set the troop levels . "    " What a novel idea for the     to turn to his Mattis and say , ’what you need to win ? ’ " Graham said . " What do you need to win ? " Troop specifications date back to at least the Vietnam War , according to the Government Accountability Office . They have Troop specifications date back to at least the Vietnam War, according to the Government Accountability Office served as a political marker to define the scale of US military involvement in places like Iraq , but military officials see the numbers as arbitrary , a straitjacket that forces commanders to artificially split units and use contractors to meet the caps .   Trump ’s move to loosen the reins on military commanders in Afghanistan follows a similar decision about the generals’ decision making authority in Syria and Iraq . Iraq late April , Trump delegated Trump to Mattis to set troop levels in the fight against ISIS , a move a senior US defense official said " enables military commanders to become more agile , adaptive and efficient in supporting our partners . " Troop levels in Syria are Syria now around 500 , though officials tell CNN the number on the ground is closer to 1 , 000 . Officials have explained that discrepancy by saying the difference is due to temporary forces not being counted as part of the official total . The same is true in Iraq , where the official number of US troops is a little over 5 , 000 , though officials have told CNN in CNN past that levels are actually closer to 7 , 000 .   In Afghanistan , there are now about 8 , 400 US troops taking part in Operation Resolute Support , which involves both counter terrorism operations against ISIS and the Taliban as well as the mission to train , advise and assist Afghan forces .   Some , like Stephen Miles , the director of Win Without War , a group focused on promoting a more progressive national security policy , have said they worry a group is an attempt by Trump to wash his hands of responsibility for these wars .    " President Trump Trump this decision to Secretary of Defense James Mattis in a seeming effort to absolve responsibility for sending US troops into harm ’s way , " Miles said . " But make no mistake , President Trump is Trump he will be held Trump for once again escalating this endless war in Afghanistan . " Miles is among those who question the wisdom of sending more troops into a war that US officials acknowledge is n’t looking good     and has been going on for 16 years now .   Not winning , " Even Mattis himself has acknowledged that the US is ’not winning’ the war against the Taliban , and the administration has not provided any explanation on how sending a few thousand more troops will reverse that course , " Miles said .   He noted that Afghanistan Even Mattis himself problems     longstanding tribal and regional feuds , poverty , rampant corruption     remain unsolved after 16 years of war and considerable American blood and treasure , and likely ca n’t be resolved with a military response . That sort of larger strategic vision and a larger strategy is important , said Michael Eisenstadt , a Eisenstadt no problems with giving Mattis authority over troop levels . " Civilian oversight is provided by the civilian service secretaries and the civilian SECDef , " he said , using the shorthand for defense secretary . " That has n’t changed . " But Eisenstadt sees potential problems in the administration Eisenstadt lack of a clear strategic vision . Indeed , Mattis told lawmakers that there is n’t a Eisenstadt strategy yet     that he and other Cabinet officials are working on one and " we Mattis present that to the president , probably within the next several weeks Mattis "   Eisenstadt said that could pose problems " if local military commanders are given greater latitude to act , as seems to be the case , Eisenstadt the policy framework and goals they are supposed to be acting within and advancing , respectively , are not clear , " he added .   That ’s likely to local military commanders the case as policy reviews on a number of issues are currently underway , Eisenstadt said Eisenstadt even as " the ground regarding some of these issues is shifting under our feet as we speak . That could be Eisenstadt problem . " Formula for a foreign policy mess , " Add to that the fact that the our may be distracted by his domestic problems     you may possibly have a formula for a foreign policy mess , " Eisenstadt said .   Others flag that no the President how capable Trump ’s generals are , he ca n’t expect them to advise him on the political and policy implications of military decisions .   Derek Chollet , a former defense Trump in the Obama no matter how capable Trump’s generals are , noted Trump military decisions have costs , and that civilian leadership has the responsibility for assessing them . That means maintaining a broader view that takes in more than just the military aspects of a campaign , an assessment that is civilian leadership to US national interests .   " If we decide to dramatically escalate our role in Afghanistan , well , that ’s got to come from somewhere . Someone has to pay for that and we have to we that risk somewhere , " Chollet said .   And if the civilian leadership is n’t engaged , the danger is we the " military does n’t have the perspective of the entire country in mind , " Chollet said . " If we end up escalating conflicts at the expense of other priorities in the federal budget , in our foreign policy Chollet that ’s a problem . "
