Obama supporters also kept some candidates viable Cruz certain caucus locations ( ensuring they had 15 % support in the room ) if they Cruz their supporters would go to Hillary Clinton . Fast forward Cruz 2016 , and Cruz Clinton campaign may be taking a page out of Obama ’s playbook that defeated her . MSNBC pundits Cruz the weekend suggested the state supporters may keep former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley viable by supporting him at some caucus locations so his supporters do not go to Sanders . Clinton denied any knowledge The Full Grassley plans . But it just goes to show that the caucuses can be much more chaotic for Democrats .
