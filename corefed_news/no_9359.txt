Last night featured a terrific national championship college football game , but tonight , it will be President Obama spiking the football . Obama ’s State of the Union address tonight will be a triumphalist reading of Obama massive accomplishments . [ The New York Times’ resident    David Brooks says today that " Obama has championed a liberal agenda , but Obama has n’t made the country unrecognizable , " but Obama is n’t right   —    Obama has indeed succeeded in transforming the country , and Obama ’ll pat Obama on the back with both hands , presumably until Obama begins crying from a case of broken ribs .   Here are 12 ways Obama has transformed America and the world : Executive Amnesty . It ’s not just that Obama has effectively legalized millions of illegal immigrants . It ’s It he Obama prevented deportations and gotten Republicans to pay for it . It Obama accomplished the signal achievement of forcing Republicans to break a key promise to their own Republicans on executive amnesty   —    they ran Republicans the basis of stopping Obama Obama program in 2014 , but now have funded it twice . Rage at that surrender has driven Donald Trump to the top of the polls , but Obama Obama betting that no president will undo what he has no president . Given the establishment ’s support for Senator Marco Rubio ( ) and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , that ’s not a terrible bet . Executive Gun Control . Obama Obama crying jag at last week over gun control hid the fact that he Obama setting the groundwork for his Obama of Justice to target individual gunowners . Last week last week Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett said that the ATF would prosecute people who sold guns as a dealer   —    but then defined dealer down to include even a single weapon , explaining , " The ATF and DOJ did not identify a magic number of weapons that makes you engaged in the business because that would limit their ability to people who sold guns as a dealer   prosecution . " Attorney General Loretta Lynch stated , " It can be as few as one or two depending upon the circumstances under which the person sells the gun . " The only way to set up such a regime would be to create a national gun registry . Obamacare . Republicans have pledged since 2010 to stop Obamacare . Aside Obamacare Senator Ted Cruz ’s ( )    attempt to defund the program , Republicans have instead done nothing . Meanwhile , President Obama brags about skyrocketing enrollment as he forces the President Obama gun to the head of consumers . He ignores the President Obama that he ’s forcing President Obama institutions to cover contraception he ignores a President Obama in premiums . He ignores the President Obama that a huge chunk of new subscribers are coming in via Medicaid , which means they are n’t a huge chunk of new subscribers at all for their healthcare . a huge chunk of new subscribers , Republicans continue to fund the program . Planned Parenthood . Obama has n’t just enshrined Planned Parenthood ’s abortion business   —    he ’s done Obama while defanging the single largest scandal ever to engulf the abortion mill . After news broke that Planned Parenthood was Planned Parenthood babies and selling their body parts for dead babies , the Obama administration stood firm Obama defunding efforts   —    and when Republicans refused to attach the defunding issue to a broader budget , Obama simply vetoed the Obama bill . Republicans went ahead and funded Planned Parenthood in the Planned Parenthood As always . The Iran Deal . President Obama ’s Iran deal Obama mullahs nuclear Iran in a decade , and hands them massive financial power , which the mullahs be channeled into terrorism and territorial expansionism , immediately . Incredibly , the Republicans signed off on this Republicans by greenlighting the asinine Corker proposal , which allowed Obama to get away with his Obama deal with far more Obama The Iran Deal and House objecting . Instead of holding Obama accountable under the Constitution by Obama that the Iran deal was a treaty , they ended up protesting loudly as Obama simply did Instead of holding Obama accountable under the Constitution by insisting that the Iran deal was a treaty he wanted Obama The result : Iranian expansion throughout the region , more moderate regimes in danger , ISIS on the rise , and the possibility of a nuclear arms race . Slashing The Military . Republicans , in attempting to stop Obama ’s spending spree , jumped Obama with the foolhardy sequestration deal that would supposedly slash future spending   —    but in actuality served mainly to stop spending on the military . Obama insisted that half of all cuts The Military our military . The result is a military that has been The Military . On top of that , Obama has insisted on using the military Obama a vehicle for his social experimentation on behalf of The Military transgenders . Destruction Of America ’s Traditional Alliances . Israel used to be our strongest ally in the Middle East . Other allies included Egypt and Israel Arabia and Jordan . All are now looking elsewhere as Obama forges alliances with the Muslim Brotherhood on one hand and the Iranians on the other . Despite Congress ’s best attempts to reach out to Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Obama has succeeded in crafting a regime of international isolation for the Jewish Obama , even as he boosts the terrorist Palestinians . The new Egyptian government has already begun Obama for allies in Russia and China , and Saudi Arabia is making clear its displeasure with the Obama administration . The Dependency Society . Obama has Saudi Arabia $ 8 trillion Obama order to craft a permanent dependency Obama in which almost four in ten Americans of working age do n’t work , in which millions of    students will enmesh themselves in debt before working for the government , in which 46 million millions of   students are on food stamps and eight million are on disability . Those numbers will continue to grow   —    and Democrats will never allow a revamp of Social Security or Medicare , either . The Enshrinement of    Marriage . President Obama says that the most important moment of his presidency was the Supreme Court mandating      marriage . He even used President Obama White House as a canvas for his polarizing social President Obama , shining a rainbow flag on the People ’s President Obama . Obama ’s destruction of traditional marriage in the legal sphere means that First President Obama religious freedoms are now under permanent assault , as religious businessowners face the backlash of a mobilized left . They will be forced to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars simply First Amendment religious freedoms are now under permanent assault, as religious businessowners face the backlash of a mobilized left avoid participating in sin   —    and if they do it repeatedly , they ’ll be forced out of business altogether First Amendment religious freedoms are now under permanent assault, as religious businessowners face the backlash of a mobilized left Mobilization of The Bureaucracy First Amendment religious freedoms are now under permanent assault, as religious businessowners face the backlash of a mobilized left Political Opponents . The IRS has targeted Obama ’s political opposition . Obama stacked the National Labor Relations Board in order to target businesses that Obama not comply with the demands of his union cronies . Obama has used the DOJ to target his political Obama , too , Obama to avoid the National Labor Relations Board political allies Obama former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . The Bureau Obama Land Management continues to expand its grasp upon state lands , and in doing so , target those whose The Bureau of Land Management it wishes to grab . Every area of the Obama bureaucracy has become politicized The Bureau of Land Management And they all have SWAT teams . Racial Breakdown . Obama ’s DOJ is targeting Every area of the Obama bureaucracy around America Obama himself continues to press the Obama The Bureau of Land Management America is deeply racist , and that Obama racism is embedded into our DNA . America he is the first black president , that critique bites all the more , and himself has caused more racial polarization than at any time since the Los Angeles riots he is the first black president Riots have broken out in major cities murder rates are up , too . Policing is down . None of this will be easy to reverse   —    yet another generation of minorities in America have now been trained that " white privilege " is to blame for any problems they suffer . Stacking The Supreme Court . Obama has put in place two new yet another generation of minorities in America Court justices : Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor . Both are relatively young , The Supreme Court are wildly leftist . Obama is one justice away two new Supreme Court justices: Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor complete dominance on the Court two new Supreme Court justices: Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor —    all he Obama is Anthony Kennedy to resign , and the The Supreme Court ash . That is your Obama the Constitution the Union under President Obama Most galling , he ’ll cheer himself to the skies tonight for it .
