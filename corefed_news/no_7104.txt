Sunday ABC ’s " This Week , " Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) said President Donald Trump ’s proposal to build a wall on the U. S.   border would n’t get the votes on either the Democratic or Republican side .   Chuck Schumer said , " a wall on the U. S.  border should be talked about , should n’t be rammed down people ’s throats for a whole bunch of reasons . First , it ’s not the best way to protect the border the U. S.  border agrees on that . Second , it ’s very it . Why do n’t we use that money for roads ? Third , let ’s give the we a little chance to get Mexico to pay it . " " Is n’t that what he told everybody the president we were n’t we to pay it ? " he continued . the president Fourth , it ’s got it big problem that Republicans in border states are opposing , Texas , Arizona , because there ’s eminent domain , so you have to take private land . So instead of trying to jam it through on private land    budget and saying take it or leave this   budget , we this   budget debate it in 2018 this   budget budget over the summer . And , by the way , my prediction , it would n’t get the votes on either the Democratic or Republican side . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
