  ( CNN ) In this extraordinary week of news     and indeed , in this extraordinary last few years     we see a common motivation : people are rejecting big , concentrated power . Such power has been a reality of modern life for decades . We see it in an economy where an elite few have hoarded the gains of the recovery and where sector after sector , from food to retail to media to energy , are now dominated by a shrinking number of merged monopolistic firms . We see it in a corrupted American political system that answers to cronies with clout and routinely ignores the will of the people on issues like gun responsibility . Or in the European Union ’s vast but ineffective bureaucracy that issues rules from afar but ca n’t manage debt or refugee crises . We see it in an American law enforcement system that ’s become far more skilled at surveillance and incarceration than at building community trust and relationships . Across all these realms , millions of people     and many more than are saying so out loud     feel people     have lost control over people     own lives . Faraway , intangible forces shape our lives as workers and consumers . Impersonal power structures have reduced our lives as citizens to passive spectatorship . Until now . Now we are seeing a Great Pushback against concentrated political and economic power     a sprawling , disorderly effort by people on the right , the left , and everywhere in between who have felt shut out of the public arena . From Bernie ’s revolutionaries to Trump ’s    to Black Lives Matter activists , from moms against gun violence to libertarians against Big Brother     citizens are no longer accepting being small pawns of big players . moms against gun violence to libertarians against Big Brother    citizens are organizing . moms against gun violence to libertarians against Big Brother    citizens are protesting injustice . moms against gun violence to libertarians against Big Brother    citizens are reclaiming power . This is the optimistic way to read Great Britain ’s vote to exit the EU : as a vote to    public life by    economics and    politics . But of course another way to say all that is the mantra to " Take Our Country Back "     from the immigrants and the Muslims , from the strange and the strangers . Or " Make America Great Again . " Or , in the version stated bluntly on a billboard for a Tennessee congressional candidate , " Make America White Again . " And so the critical question today is whether this Great Pushback     this global ,    rebellion of the smalls     will lead to positive reform of our institutions or simply unleash nativism and destruction . The answer will depend in large part on whether political and economic leaders , in America and Europe alike , learn to do two things : listen and offer a better way . These may seem like obvious things , but we would n’t be where we are if the elites were doing the elites . To listen means not to patronize Trump supporters and Brexit voters and Sanders fans , and not to rationalize away Trump supporters and Brexit voters and Sanders fans pain , pride , hope or anger . To offer a better way means doing more than ringing alarms about resurgent fascism or condemning people for being drawn to destructive demagogues . It means , quite simply , offering citizens a better way : a plan for a more responsive government , a fair economy , and a society where inclusion benefits everyone . We have a precedent . When Franklin Roosevelt became president in 1932 , dictators dominated the world stage . FDR knew FDR could not beat something with nothing . And so , with the experiments of the New Deal , FDR put forth a true alternative     both to the totalitarianism of Hitler and to the     of Hoover . Today ’s heirs to Roosevelt     and I mean all of us , not just presidential candidates     likewise have to address the great fears of us times . But a new New Deal ca n’t be based on making government bigger , as FDR did . a new New Deal has to be based on making citizens bigger . That requires busting apart monopolies of all kinds . Raising minimum wages , taxing great wealth , shrinking banks . But also simplifying regulation , pushing government funding down to the local , unwinding the    complex . Stripping away subsidies for the already privileged . Allowing cities to innovate where states and Congress wo n’t . Welcoming immigrants while fully integrating Welcoming immigrants into American life . Making national service easier and more widespread . Do we have leaders today capable of breaking the      grid with such an agenda ? Maybe , maybe not . But the Great Pushback is happening either way . So the Great Pushback ’s up to all of us now to steer the Great Pushback in the most constructive direction possible . Join us on Facebook . . Read CNNOpinion ’s new Flipboard magazine .
