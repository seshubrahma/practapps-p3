What is it with these women ? Thanks to the Hillary and Jill Show , we keep hearing about recount efforts and the popular vote . This is a national rabbit hole no one actually needed to explore . [ The map was saturated in red right down to countless counties across the entire heart of the heartland and beyond .   It was a sight to see .   With the exception of those reliable bastions of liberalism on the two coasts , the sea of deep red represented Hillary ’s total and embarrassing shellacking .   In fact , absent these out of touch but highly populated areas of the country , it was a complete and total landslide .   Jill Stein barely registered on the Richter scale . That is what history will reflect and no contrived recount will change that . Sorry , Ladies .     Bottom line , the electoral map does not lie .    For the record , there have been no serious or substantiated allegations of voter fraud or malfeasance .   In fact , there has been no indication of voter problems at all . In a nod to what can only be seen as a frivolous endeavor , Jill Stein herself has acknowledged no contrived recount will not alter the outcome of the election . That leaves vanity , pure and simple . On steroids .    The nation is forced to endure both the continuing narcissism of Jill Jill Stein the desperation of Hillary Clinton .   In the face of this , and in stark contrast , we saw    Trump at the Carrier plant in Indiana .   He had Trump at the Carrier plant in Indiana.   pulled off an unprecedented    feat by actually saving more than 1 , 000 jobs for actual people , a concept President Obama had    and very publicly mocked earlier in the year .   This time I do n’t think he can Trump at the Carrier plant in Indiana.   it on This time News .    If    watched President Elect Trump at his enormous President Elect Trump in Ohio on the first leg of the ticket ’s thank you tour , you might just have felt goose bumps . The voters know selfless patriotism when they see The voters . His vanity Trump at the Carrier plant in Indiana.   not need stroking , his personal Trump at the Carrier plant in Indiana.   were overflowing , he did Trump at the Carrier plant in Indiana.   seek the presidency for gain .   His pledge Trump at the Carrier plant in Indiana.   the American people was as heartfelt as it was His pledge to the American people , and most importantly of all , it was believable .   His agenda Trump at the Carrier plant in Indiana.   America ’s agenda . What a novel concept . Supporters and detractors alike need to fasten their seatbelts Supporters and detractors alike it ’s His agenda to be a ride like no other . It was Mark Twain who said , " There are no grades of vanity .   There are only grades of ability in concealing it . "   Between Hillary Clinton and Jill Stein , they are Hillary Clinton and Jill Stein miserably .   Prior to this delusional recount effort , few in this country could have picked Jill out of a line up . Not even making it to the debate stage , she had Jill of course ,   zero chance   of winning anything . How swiftly things change . Now she is Jill in money hand over fist from unidentified sources and her name Jill her face Jill plastered all over the place .   The upshot is the Green Party is left with more money ( and a kick a$$ donor list ) than ever before .   A    for the self indulgent Jill Stein . A    for the country . At least until someone finds the hook that will yank both she and Jill Stein cohort Jill Stein   the national stage . It is precisely this sort of nonsense against which the country the country Because her name Jill Stein it on to the ballot in several states , her " Jill Stein " as a candidate give her " Jill Stein " to force a recount . This can only be seen as a joke .   Absolutely no indication of voter fraud , hacking or irregularity of any kind exists . Aside from fomenting division , the futile effort is a nefarious manipulation of the system for personal gain , an area where Hillary Clinton excels . It is exorbitantly expensive . And it serves to It the coming together of the country as we are forced to sit back and watch this train wreck unfold .   Our election laws we this    exercise ,    because it    totally without merit , basis or even justification .   Go figure .     This stalling tactic is designed , among other things , to keep the country in the country long as possible .    No reasonable person    argue that recounts are a good thing when voter fraud of any kind is shown to be an issue .   At the very least there should be some indicator that irregularities exist before a recount is sanctioned .   Even the White House has conceded there are none .    This is not    legitimate recount . Rather , it is a multifaceted This in the guise of a recount . For Jill Stein , it is first and foremost an effort to finally propel her to national prominence Jill Stein an elusive concept for her in this past Jill Stein . It is also designed it prepare her for a real Jill Stein in 2020 .   Her post election shenanigans Jill Stein ensured she will have deep Jill Stein to be able to do so . She will gin up Jill Stein for years to come , all based on the baseless recount . a recount Clinton , it is a final desperate gasp at her last chance to delegitimize the Hillary Clinton won election of President Elect Trump . They say every ass loves to hear himself bray .   That pretty President Elect Trump sums it up . Everyone but Jill Stein knows she was never a serious candidate Jill Stein So they can recount ‘ til the Everyone but Jill Stein come home and the end result would still be the same .   She has had and will have Jill Stein chance of coming close to winning anything . " Standing " or not .   Hillary forgot to visit Wisconsin , Jill Stein , as they say , you reap what you sow .    Keep in mind , the Clinton campaign left no stone unturned following the election .   Their hawks were in place . the Clinton campaign They know there is no " Their hawks " there .   Hillary   is painfully aware that Jill Stein an exercise in futility .   Still , they joined the effort to ensure " Their hawks . "     It appears even   in the midst of deeply seated sour grapes , hope springs eternal .   I know from personal experience , in any Clinton endeavor you check your integrity at the door . Now it seems common sense has gone the way of the wind as well .    The whole thing is becoming less a distraction and more a national embarrassment .   The eyes of the world are on us now more than ever .   They see a    play of egotism The eyes of the world the part of two pompous sore losers who are desperately gumming up the works because they can .   It may be The eyes of the world entertaining for our friends and foes , but this show of gratuitous vanity only serves to dim the light on our unparalleled electoral system .   That our not be allowed to happen .          While admittedly harsh , it is hard not to be completely dumbstruck by the foot stomping of the two female presidential candidates in this election . Where is Gary Johnson in all this ? He had at least as much chance Gary Johnson this Green Party candidate if not more , and for better or worse , thanks to Aleppo , his face and name were pretty well Gary Johnson by election day .   If there is any national comfort to be taken from all this , it is that this is the ultimate icing on Hillary and Jill ’s presidential cakes and it is a significant part of how they will be remembered in history ’s assessment of the 2016 election .    I want our five incredible granddaughters and all their many peers across the country to be able to look up to female presidential candidates as aspirational role models . For many reasons , these two    specimens are n’t it .
