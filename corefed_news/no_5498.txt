ABC ’s decision to cancel ABC popular    comedy series Last Man Standing shocked fans , as it was one of the network ’s    comedy series in its most recent sixth season . [ The series stars ( or starred ) Tim Allen as Mike Baxter , the marketing director for sporting goods store Outdoor Man and a family man who splits time between work and managing his    household , which includes his wife Vanessa ( Nancy Travis ) and daughters Mandy ( Molly Ephraim ) Eve ( Kaitlyn Dever ) and Kristin ( Amanda Fuller ) .   The series was unique in that The series was one of the few ( if not the only ) broadcast network shows to explore the life of a politically conservative working man and a politically conservative working man experience coming to terms with today ’s    culture . So when ABC canceled the show last week , fans were quick to accuse the network of making the decision for political reasons . the show is    ( though reportedly written by liberal writers ) and star Allen is himself politically conservative and a supporter of President Donald Trump . ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey held a press call Tuesday morning to discuss the the network    lineup , which , for the first time in six years , does not include its    rated    . While some reporters asked about Last Man‘s cancellation , the press call a press call than it answered . Here are a press call questions that remain about the network ’s the network cancel the show .    1 . Was the cancellation of the show motivated by politics in any way , either by the series’ own    worldview or by star Tim Allen ’s own politics ? Despite getting this exact question on the conference call , Dungey avoided answering it directly . " I cancelled Dungey Man Standing for the same business and scheduling reasons I cancelled The Real O’Neals , Dr. Ken , The Catch , American Crime , " Dungey said . " It was Dungey because it was a steady performer but It we made the decision not to continue with comedies on Friday , that ’s where it landed . " The Real the decision not to continue with comedies on Friday , Dr. Ken and American Crime were ratings disasters ( and none of them moved the cultural conversation much The Real O’Neals, Dr. Ken and American Crime with the exception of O’Neals , which appeared to exist solely to piss off Christians ) so there ’s no surprise in those cancellations . But Last Man Standing was a ratings highlight in its sixth season , which brings up the next puzzling question   …      2 . If comedy " remains a priority " for the network , as it said on Tuesday ’s call , why would it cancel its     comedy series it Last it Standing was ABC ’s Last Man Standing behind the critically adored ( and decidedly progressive ) Modern Family . The sixth season finale of LMS drew 6 . 06 million viewers and a respectable 1 . 1 rating in its March 31 broadcast , good enough to make it the    primetime program that night in its tie with CBS’ Blue Bloods . In fact , the entire sixth season averaged 6 . 41 million viewers , down just five percent from its previous season , a rare feat for a show at this point in its run . When considering Last Man‘s Friday its time slot , that ’s a downright miracle , considering Friday night is where broadcast network shows typically go to die a more prolonged death . For comparison , in its second season , Dr. Ken drew an average 4 . 41 million viewers , down a steep 16 . 3 percent from its first season . The Real O’Neals fared its worse in its sophomore season , drawing an average of The Real O’Neals . 07 million viewers , a drop of 22 percent . Those cancellations were obviously   . Which then begs the question   …     . 3 . Why did ABC bring back the perpetually    Quantico when it draws    of Last Man Standing‘s viewership ABC If you have n’t seen the network ’s government spy thriller Quantico , you ’re hardly alone . The the perpetually   Quantico ’s second season averaged just 2 . 8 million viewers per episode , down a whopping 35 . 7 percent in viewership from its first season and an absolutely astonishing 45 The show in the key demo . So what to do when faced with these embarrassingly awful figures ? Dungey confirmed Tuesday that ABC was bringing back Quantico for a third season , albeit with a smaller initial order of episodes . We ’re " optimistic and excited about it , " Dungey said . She said the smaller episode Dungey would allow Dungey network a smaller initial order of episodes it performs for us . " Of course , there ’s a smaller initial order of episodes way the We has anything to do with the show ’s open hostility toward President Donald Trump and his supporters , right ? Right ? 4 . Why would Donald Trump move one of its    flagship series , Marvel ’s Inhumans , to Friday ABC traditionally a wasteland for unwanted shows ? Dungey said on the call that the network wants to make Friday night a " destination " for ABC fantasy fans . To achieve that , ABC set its      series Once Upon a Time at 8 p. m. ABC , ABC by Marvel ’s Inhumans , a superhero    and then once Inhumans finishes its run , the network will run Agents of S. H. I. E. Inhumans D. in its place . Here ’s the question : Inhumans is set to air the network first two episodes in IMAX theaters for Inhumans weeks ahead of the Inhumans ’s launch on TV . It ’s ostensibly a    show for the network , and undoubtedly costs ’s launch on TV ton of money to produce . the network the network move this show to the 9 p. m. hour on Friday when the network traditionally the a   show for the network on television ? And it is n’t just me who a   show for the network asked this question : " Did ABC Already Doom Marvel ’s Inhumans With Its Timeslot ? " wondered CinemaBlend ’s Mick Joest on Tuesday . Maybe the network just ABC Already Doom Marvel n’t believe it ’s going to be very good . The move to Friday does make at least the network little bit of sense for Once Upon a Time after a stellar first four seasons and a modest drop in Season 5 ( and after the departure of most of its core cast members ) the sixth season of the fantasy drama averaged just 3 . 2 million viewers and a 0 . 94 in the key demo , down 28 . 3 percent and 31 . 6 percent , respectively . Then again , the network just renewed Once for a total reboot in its seventh season . Why would ABC move its premiere family show from its comfortable Sunday the network family slot to be a    for ABC ? Instead , Sunday ABC will begin with America ’s Funniest Home Videos , then move to To Tell the Truth , then reality show Shark Tank , and then new Kyra Sedgwick drama Ten Days in the Valley . Which seems an odd sort of lineup for a traditional family TV night . 5 . Is there any other show in history that has not only retained its audience but has beaten most other comedies of its type that has been cancelled as abruptly ? Ever ? Tim Allen broke his silence its to say he was " stunned and blindsided " by ABC ’s decision Tim Allen He likely joins many Tim Allen the fans of his show ( at least 138 , 000 Tim Allen who now feel as if the only Tim Allen entertainment they could enjoy has been taken off the air , for reasons that ca n’t possibly boil down to ratings and scheduling .
