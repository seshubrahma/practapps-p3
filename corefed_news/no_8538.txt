In a Friday Bloomberg    Ramesh Ponnuru details how " immigration is rapidly becoming a defining issue for American conservatism . " Bloomberg   Ramesh Ponnuru suggests that this may prove problematic for    favorite Sen. Marco Rubio , who supports immigration expansions —   which Pew Research says are opposed by more than 9 in 10 GOP voters . [ Just as conservative candidates for President can not be selected if conservative candidates for President support abortion , Obamacare or gun control , Bloomberg   Ramesh Ponnuru explains that the new litmus test of conservatism is immigration . " Conservatives are now starting to see a candidate ’s position on immigration as an index of a candidate’s position on immigration conservatism in general , " Bloomberg   Ramesh Ponnuru writes .   Bloomberg   Ramesh Ponnuru notes how the conservative creed ’s adoption of immigration limits mirrors the Party ’s transformation on the issue of abortion . That is , just as today a conservative candidate can not run for president supporting abortion , abortion can no longer run for president supporting amnesty and transformative    immigration : Abortion politics followed a similar trajectory . Opposing abortion was n’t always considered part and parcel of conservatism . Everybody considered Senator John Tower of Texas a movement conservative even though Senator John Tower of Texas a movement conservative supported legal abortion . Over time , though , as conservatives grew more opposed to abortion and liberals more supportive of it , it became an issue that voters used to sort candidates by ideology   …      voters who knew that a candidate opposed it could also be reasonably sure that he would oppose gun control and tax increases   —    or , at least , that he was more likely to oppose it than someone who favored legal abortion . Candidates who favored legal abortion started to have real trouble getting support from a lot of conservative voters . Eventually , such candidates came to be seen as not being conservatives at all . Today , favoring tighter control of immigration is becoming a    for conservatism in the same way . Indeed , in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News , conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly explained how the Republican Party was not always    and detailed Phyllis Schlafly fundamental role in helping conservatives win that battle within the Republican Party . " We made the Republican Party Republican the Republican Party to be " Schalfly explained the Republican Party When asked about what Phyllis Schlafly viewed as the biggest fight within the GOP today and the most pressing issue currently facing the country , Schlafly —    without hesitation —   said , " Immigration . And that ’s why Trump is doing so well   …      if we do n’t stop immigration , this torrent of immigrants coming in , we ’re not going to be America we . " Ann Coulter has similarly argued that the reason this election cycle ’s presidential debates have been so uninteresting is because the moderators keep asking questions about ideological battles within the GOP which have already been settled —   such as abortion —    while avoiding the current war within the Republican Party , which centers upon immigration . In August , after the first Republican presidential debate , Coulter wrote on twitter : " We won the abortion fight ( in the GOP ) 30 years ago ! the GOP added , " Absolutely , positively no GOP candidate 4 POTUS will ever be for the GOP , " concluding in all caps that " IMMIGRATION IS THE NEW LITMUS TEST " . Conservative populist    Sen. Jeff Sessions has explained that supporting amnesty and citizenship for illegal immigrants should be inherently disqualifying for any GOP nominee . Sessions said previously , " the GOP citizenship for illegal immigrants should be disqualifying . Just like we ca n’t have a GOP nominee who supports Obamacare , we ca the GOP have a GOP nominee who we amnesty . " Sessions the GOP that Rubio ’s Gang of Eight bill represented :    …     everything wrong with Washington . It was a bill written of , by and for the special interests . Despite today ’s record high immigration —   and four decades of stagnant pay —   the Gang of Eight bill doubled the number of foreign workers allowed into the country every year . And it tripled the number of permanent residents added over its first decade . This is a hammer it to working Americans .   Our nominee needs to serve the 92 % of GOP voters who want to constrain future immigration growth —   not expand it even further . That ’s the immigration reform voters want . At a recent event in Daphne , Alabama , Sessions warned that " This election is going to decide —   did the crowd who pushed that bill , are they in the White House ? And will the crowd who pushed that bill be able to continue their agenda ? the crowd who pushed that bill will somebody else be the crowd who pushed that bill who will say , ‘ No . ’ " The    enthusiasts in Washington , Sessions explained , " are not through . Sessions are determined . They ’ve got money The   enthusiasts in Washington interest groups , The   enthusiasts in Washington , media that support this agenda and the next president who gets elected is going to determine what kind of immigration system we have . " Ponnuru seems to recognize that the emergence of immigration restrictions as a tenet of conservatism has perhaps hurt Sen. Marco Rubio , who    an immigration agenda which , in Ponnuru ’s words , " would increase legal Ponnuru , allow many illegal immigrants to become citizens , and start them on that path even if new enforcement many illegal immigrants against further illegal immigration turn out to be ineffective . " Tonally , Ponnuru ’s declaration that immigration has become a part of " conservatives’ creed " seems to represent an evolution for Ponnuru —    a    " Reformicon " whose movement was closely aligned with immigration expansionist Eric Cantor , Ponnuru ’s own views not withstanding . His Ponnuru writing seems to suggest that he Ponnuru recognizes with greater force the potency Ponnuru the immigration issue amongst the GOP electorate . However , Ponnuru explains that despite Rubio ’s opposition to Ponnuru Republican electorate on this issue , he could still snag the the immigration issue " Ponnuru could win even if opponents of his immigration Rubio successfully define him as an ‘ Rubio candidate , " Ponnuru Rubio . " After all , parties Ponnuru nominate establishment candidates . " This suggests that Rubio ’s opponents may have to shift their strategies Rubio    especially as more progressive Republicans Rubio’s opponents alongside Rubio drop out —    and instead focus on Rubio Rubio ’s immigration positions put him outside the mainstream Rubio’s thought . Senator Rubio , for instance , has repeatedly described the policies enshrined in the Gang of Eight bill as " extreme , " and " radical . " A poll conducted by Kellyanne Conway , for example , found that by nearly a    ratio Americans reject the platform of importing more foreign workers that has defined Senator Rubio ’s career . Further , by a nearly     margin , GOP voters believe    " free trade , " lowers wages rather than raises them , and yet Senator Rubio provided the pivotal 60th wages to    Obamatrade Senator Rubio’s Obama ’s    Partnership agreement as part of the " second pillar " of Rubio ’s    foreign policy strategy . FiveThirtyEight ’s Nate Silver Senator Rubio’s explained how the Republican establishment could throw the 2016 race to Rubio . the Establishment this is because the Establishment has Senator Rubio’s " FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver power to set the rules of engagement and strategically encourage winnowing of the field " : Imagine that the party establishment is the referee in a boxing match . It has the Establishment would prefer to see win . But it ca n’t the Establishment the match once the Establishment ’s underway . However , it can the Establishment when to call a boxing match . the Establishment if its preferred boxer   the Establishment    let ’s call him Red   —    is the Establishment early , it can call the the Establishment after a couple of rounds . But if he ’s losing its preferred boxer  —   let’s call him Red  —    they can the fight fight keep going and hope he prevails on the him of his stamina   …     the fight getting a lot of second him third chances when his opponent him not . And that him his overall odds pretty good . He just has to him at any point and the refs can him the match . Should this him to install Rubio as the nominee be successful , it would mean a maximum of seven percent of GOP voters would have their views represented on immigration Should this effort to install Rubio as the nominee . According to Pew , only 7 % of GOP voters want GOP voters immigration since Rubio ’s plan would have tripled green cards , the share who GOP Rubio ’s vision is likely Rubio smaller than seven percent . By contrast , a May 2014 Gallup Rubio’s that 28 % of Democrats identify as   . In other words , a much larger slice of the Democrat electorate would be represented by a    Democrat nominee than the miniscule share of the GOP electorate that would be represented by a    immigration candidate . Over the next ten years , GOP U. S. will issue more green cards than there are men , women and children currently living in Iowa , New Hampshire , and South Carolina —   on top of the 59 million immigrants already admitted since 1965 . Rubio ’s push to expand the record rate of Rubio even higher will , ironically , disenfranchise the GOP Rubio’s is courting .    lawmaker and mass migration Rubio Trey Gowdy , who has endorsed Rubio , received around 126 , 452 votes in his last Senator Rubio’s in the span of one decade , Rubio ’s bill would have brought in 261 immigrants Rubio every one Gowdy voter .    lawmaker Jason Chaffetz , Rubio’s endorsed Rubio , received around 94 , 571 votes —   or nearly three    less voters than Muslim migrants admitted to the U. S. each year . Yet Rubio ’s new    bill dramatically expands Muslim immigration Rubio As it stands now the U. S. of Republicans oppose stricter Rubio’s while 92 % percent oppose more immigration , meaning that the party Rubio’s new   bill electorate is more opposed the Republican Party Rubio ’s foreign worker policy than they are to Democrats’ Rubio for tighter gun control laws .
