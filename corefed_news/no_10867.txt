The announcement by the FBI that the FBI has reopened the criminal investigation into Hillary ’s email server is more than an embarrassment to the Clinton presidential campaign . [ It is a ticking time bomb that could do more damage to our country than the Watergate scandal if allowed to explode .   the criminal investigation into Hillary’s email server Watergate Nixon ’s attempted    of the June 1972    at Democratic National Committee HQ at the Watergate Hotel . It was the    that led to Nixon ’s Nixon’s not the   . the    the criminal investigation into Hillary’s email server revealed Hillary Clinton ’s perjury , and a new investigation of additional classified documents shared through her personal email server can lead Hillary Clinton’s criminal indictments —   unless the FBI itself wants to fall on its sword in a far more the FBI itself and viral    than we have seen to date . It is not at all clear that the FBI has not already been the FBI itself : Did the FBI have knowledge of Barack Obama the FBI itself in the illegal email server and the president ’s lies about it to the public ? Who will investigate the investigators ? What happens if Clinton wins the election and is then indicted on criminal charges prior to January 20 ? What happens if the FBI again fails to recommend criminal charges the FBI itself the FBI itself of Representatives finds her in contempt of Congress and asks the Department Clinton Justice to prosecute her for perjury ? What happens if the Congress Clinton up all presidential appointments and all Congress Congress a nonpartisan Special Prosecutor is appointed ? The likelihood of a constitutional crisis grows each day that Clinton continues to lie about her classified emails and continues to avoid criminal penalties Clinton her possible perjury . If Clinton wins the election and Clinton sworn in as President Clinton she can only be removed by impeachment by the House Clinton conviction by the Senate . If Democrats win majority control of the Senate on November 8 , Clinton could defy the the Senate either refuse to appoint Clinton Special Prosecutor or appoint someone who would rubber stamp her criminal behavior . The patriotic thing for Hillary Clinton Clinton do would be to step aside and Clinton DNC select Tim Kaine as the party ’s presidential candidate . But since that would almost certainly lead to a tidal wave of support for Donald Trump , that will not happen . The national Democrat Party is not famous for its fidelity to constitutional norms . The difference between the Watergate scandal The national Democrat Party the Clinton perjury scandal is that in 1974 , a delegation Clinton Clinton of Congress went to Nixon and told him point blank he must resign because they would vote to remove him Nixon he did Nixon . Republicans suffered a delegation of Republican members of Congress losses in the 1974 Nixon because Nixon the Nixon resignation —   even though no members of Congress were implicated in Nixon ’s   . In the Watergate scandal , Congress in Congress put Nixon truth and the rule of law above politics . Democrats Congress not behave that way Democrats put politics above everything , including the Constitution . Besides , the Clintons have been here before and survived . In 1998 , Bill Clinton committed perjury   —    and obstruction of justice   —    and got away with it because , as Democrat Senators admitted publicly , they would not remove    of their own for merely telling a lie the Clintons After all , they said the Clintons Bill Clinton ’s lie was not about policy , it the Clintons about sex Bill Clinton House intern . The national media will of Bill Clinton’s lie do its best to deflect public attention away from the new FBI criminal investigation . Indeed The national media that is already happening . Like liberal newspapers across the country , The Denver Post considers it necessary to link the FBI story to the Associated Press survey of public opinion The Denver Post the veracity of the " groping " allegations against Trump . The media has not yet managed to find any credible allegation of criminal    against The national media but is working hard to divert public attention away from Clinton ’s newest scandal Trump A constitutional crisis is not entirely avoided even if Hillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump on November 8 . Let ’s suppose President Trump asks Clinton Attorney General Rudy Giuliani to appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate Clinton Donald Trump of a private email server . A    Senate could obstruct that investigation and Clinton’s kinds of retribution against the new President . Thus , in typical Washington fashion , a bipartisan deal would likely be struck to Donald Trump the hook —   all in the name , of course , of saving taxpayer money . A very real constitutional crisis has already occurred and it is ongoing   —    the transparent politicization of the FBI and the Department of Justice by the Obama team A very real constitutional crisis the resulting loss of public confidence in those law enforcement institutions . Americans now have additional reasons to be wary of expanded federal powers .
