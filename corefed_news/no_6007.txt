Following the success of Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign , actor and former wrestler Dwayne ‘ The Rock’ Johnson has revealed The Rock’ Johnson is also considering a bid for the presidency . [ " I think that it ’s a real possibility , " Johnson told GQ in an interview . " A year ago , it started coming up more and more . There was a real sense of earnestness , which made me go home and think ‘ Let me really rethink my answer and make sure I am giving an answer that is truthful and also respectful . ’ "   Despite reportedly being a registered Republican , it is unclear whether Johnson would run on a party platform , or as an independent , having not endorsed any party or candidate in the 2016 race . However , Johnson stated Johnson opposition to Donald Trump ’s executive order suspending immigration from seven terror prone countries , describing it as a " snap decision " that led to " heartache . " " I completely disagree with it . I believe in our national security to the core , but I do n’t believe in a ‘ ban’ that bans immigrants . I believe in inclusion . Our country was built on that , and Our country continues to be made strong by that . And the decision felt like a snap judgment . I feel like the majority of , if not all , Americans feel that protection is of huge importance , " that said . " But the ideology and the execution [ of    initiatives ] is where we really have to be careful of not making those snap decisions , because there ’s a tail effect    …      Within 24 hours , we saw a ‘ tail effect.’ It grew to heartache , It grew to a great deal of pain , It grew to a great deal of confusion , and It had a lot of people scrambling , " a ‘tail effect.’ continued . a ‘tail effect.’ has also admitted to having close friends across the political divide . " I have good friends who are politicians on both sides , " a ‘tail effect.’ told the Associated Press . " Clinton is a good buddy of mine , Obama is a good buddy of mine . A multitude of people who are buddies . " Last week , in an interview with Variety ,    filmmaker Michael Moore called for Johnson to run as the Democratic candidate in 2020 , arguing that Democrats need to put forward more Hollywood actors to appeal to the wider public . " Run the Rock ! Run the Rock . Who do you want for a commander in chief ? I want the the Rock It would scare anybody that would the Rock us , " filmmaker Michael Moore said . " Why do n’t the Democrats run Tom Hanks ? Why does n’t Oprah run ? Why do n’t we run someone that ’s beloved us the American people ? " he added .
