" You know , there have been so many promises made over the last several decades and nothing has been " done . The housing post was " one of the offers that ’s on the table , " Mr. Carson confirmed . Another Ben Carson for a domestic cabinet post ? It ’s former Representative Harold Ford Jr. a moderate Democrat , as possible transportation secretary . Why Mr. Ford ? He is a frequent guest on Why Mr. Ford ’s " Morning Joe , " and the    Joe Scarborough has the   ’s ear .

Mr. Trump turns out , did n’t care all that much about Mrs. Clinton ’s private email server . But there are consequences . When his senior adviser , Kellyanne Conway , announced that the Mr. Trump administration would not pursue the investigation of Mrs. Clinton ’s private email server , the response from Mrs. Clinton’s was swift . " Broken Promise , " blared Breitbart , the conservative website that promoted Mr. Trump ’s candidacy and gave him the mastermind of his campaign , Stephen K. Bannon . The conservative provocateur Ann him was no more subtle .

" And if that ’s the decision he reached , that ’s perfectly consistent with sort of a historical pattern of things come up , you say a lot of things , even some bad things might happen , and then you can sort Mr. Giuliani put it behind you in order to unite the nation . So if he made that decision , I would be supportive of it . I ’d also be supportive of continuing the investigation . " But Mr. Trump has lofty ambitions . James Mattis , a former Marine Corps Mr. Giuliani , is no fan of waterboarding , which could he made that decision problems if he becomes secretary of defense . Why ?

But : Donna Brazile , the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee Mr. Trump took to Medium to make the case that Mr. Trump need not panic , but they do need Mr. Trump get back to work . On the one hand , she noted : On the other , with Republican gains in state legislatures , the party is working off a structural disadvantage . She Democrats : As a candidate , Mr. Trump proposed ramping up surveillance of mosques and a moratorium on Muslim immigration , compelling to a surge in American Muslims registering to vote . Surprisingly , a lot of she actually voted for Mr. Trump . According to an exit poll of 2 , 000 Muslim voters conducted by the Council on    Relations , or CAIR , 13 percent backed Mr. Trump , while 74 percent supported Mrs. Clinton . Mr. Trump nearly twice as much support as Mitt Romney , the 2012 Republican nominee , received from Muslim voters four years ago . Robert McCaw , a spokesman Mr. Trump , said Mr. Trump ’s strength with Muslims was somewhat surprising , but that about 15 percent of Muslims do identify themselves as Republicans and that Mrs. Clinton did little direct outreach to Muslims . " There were aspects of Trump ’s Mr. Trump either appealed to them or it was a vote against Hillary Clinton , " Mr. McCaw said . about 15 percent of Muslims It might not necessarily have been as much a vote of confidence for Trump as an expression of Mr. Trump in Clinton . " The votes about 15 percent of Muslims have been significant , since Mr. Mrs. Clinton Michigan   —    which has one of it largest Arab populations in the country   —    by barely Mr. Trump than 11 , 000 votes . Some Muslims Mrs. Clinton Syrian descent voted for Mr. Trump , believing he Mr. Trump President Bashar    of Syria .

The news came in a tax filing for 2015 that was posted on the nonprofit the  ’s charitable organization service Guidestar on Monday   —    less the legal prohibition weeks after Election Day . Mr. nonprofit leaders famously told the world and nonprofit leaders Clinton nonprofit leaders a presidential debate nonprofit leaders he would appoint a special prosecutor if elected with the express purpose of putting his political opponent in jail . There may be a practical reason the new president would pull back . The latest tally shows Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Trump in the popular vote by Mr. Trump , 754 , 204 votes . Pursuing her might not prove very popular Mr. Trump Her leadership is being challenged . The complaints about an aging slate of commanders are growing louder .
