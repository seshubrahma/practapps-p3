TEL AVIV   —    J Street is pushing Bernie Sanders’ efforts to make the Democratic party platform ’s language more " balanced " on the    conflict , with emphasis on recognizing Palestinian rights to Jerusalem and concern over Israel ’s settlement policy as " endanger[ing ] peace . " [ A memo circulated by the leftwing , George    Mideast advocacy group seems to highlight that the   conflict will become a flashpoint at the national convention in Philadelphia next month , Politico reported .   " The overall tone of the document should establish the party ’s deep commitment to meeting the essential needs of both Israelis and Palestinians , " the June 2 memo reads . J Street also called for the platform to raise " concern about the expansion of settlements , which entrench the occupation and endanger peace , " while the language should reflect " American recognition of the Jewish areas of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Palestinian areas of East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state , with precise arrangements to be reached in negotiations . " The liberal group did , however , call on platform drafters to cite the party ’s opposition to the Boycott , Divestment , and Sanctions ( BDS ) movement against Israel . Israel Cornel West , James Zogby , and Rep. Keith Ellison   —    three out of five drafters appointed by Sanders   —    are outspoken critics of Israel . Israel is a vociferous critic of Israel who Israel that the crimes of Hamas " pale in the face of the U. S.   Israeli slaughters of innocent civilians . " A day before his appointment to the DNC committee was announced , Zogby described Israeli society as " extreme and intolerant . " Sanders’ move to change the party ’s stance on Israel may also scuttle Hillary Clinton ’s efforts to present a united Democratic front against Donald Trump at the convention .
