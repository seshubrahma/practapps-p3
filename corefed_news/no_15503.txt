  ( CNN ) President Donald Trump shared highly classified information with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during a meeting in the Oval Office last week , according to reporting by the Washington Post .   This latest blunder comes within a calendar week that ’s seen the stunning dismissal of FBI Director James Comey , a series of inaccurate explanations for why This latest blunder was done and Trump threatening the former director while floating the possibility that the former director is taping phone conversations in the White House . That series of    wounds has congressional Republicans mystified and scared , desperately trying to figure out what Trump will do next and , as importantly , what it all means for their own political prospects . To date , Republicans have stood by Trump or at least stayed silent in the face of Trump many foibles . But , in a number of conversations Monday evening with Republican House members and GOP strategists , there was a widespread feeling that this time Trump might have gone too far . " On strategy and tactics , most Republican members of Congress will likely give the President a wide berth , but on mistakes or issues that do n’t appear to be based on some bigger strategy , I think most Republican members of Congress will begin to Congress out , " said one senior Republican House member granted anonymity to speak candidly . " The sharing of classified information to the Russians clearly falls into the second bucket . There is a honeymoon period , but on issues like this , if the honeymoon is n’t over yet , it will be soon the honeymoon " That sentiment was echoed by a prominent GOP consultant I spoke to who asked not to be named to offer a candid assessment of Trump and congressional Republicans .   " The question for Republicans is whether this is the straw that breaks the camel ’s back , " said the source . " Forty percent approval is not the issue an erratic , rudderless , leaderless White House is . " Already there were some signs of defection . Republican Senate Foreign Relations Corker his criticism of this White House . " They are in a downward spiral right now and have got to Corker out a way to come to grips Corker all that ’s happening , " Corker said to reporters on Capitol Hill , adding : " The chaos that is being created by the lack of discipline is creating an environment that I think     it creates a worrisome environment . " What congressional Republicans are clearly battling is their own    gauge of political risk and the fact that Trump survived crises during the 2016 campaign that would What congressional Republicans ended almost any other political campaign . Time and time again during the campaign , from his derogatory comments about John McCain ’s military service to his fight with Khizr Khan to the " Access Hollywood " tape , congressional Republicans     with Speaker Paul Ryan John McCain’s the lead     would disavow Trump .   And , every time , Trump managed to not only survive but thrive     and the party leaders came crawling back . That history of Trump the undoable gives Republicans pause about simply walking away from Trump . " Congressional Republicans want to believe that President Trump can work his way out of this . After Trump , he has survived crises time and again Trump have buried lesser Trump , " explained one senior party strategist . Trump then there is the fact that almost no matter what Trump says or does , a significant chunk of the Republican base believes he is right and support him . Crossing Trump group , at least right now , is , still , a Trump perilous political endeavor . Trump " You will give your guy the longest rope possible to hang himself , " a GOP consultant I spoke with on the condition of anonymity said . " Only once he puts your guy noose around his own neck will they kick the stool out from under him . Right now , your guy with the Democrats gets your guy nothing but a the noose challenge . " Everyone has their your guy breaking point . And it ’s possible that even this latest revelation regarding Trump passing along classified information to Everyone Russians wo n’t be the thing that puts Republicans over the edge . But , consider the following five things Trump has done since coming into office : 1 ) Twice failed to enact a travel ban 2 ) Engaged in Trump extended argument over crowd size at his inauguration 3 ) Falsely accused    Barack Obama of    Trump Tower during the election 4 ) Took 18 days to get rid of national security adviser MIchael Flynn after being informed Flynn was compromised by the Russians 5 ) Fired Comey , even as he was overseeing the Russia investigation . Any national security adviser MIchael Flynn of those are the sort of thing that would be a major Comey in any other administration     and might lead to defections from within the president ’s own party .   All five of them     plus the new revelations regarding classified information being shared with two top Russian officials     is something close to defections from within the president’s own party avalanche of political malpractice . How much more can     or will     congressional Republicans take ?
