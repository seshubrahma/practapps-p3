By many measures , Chobani embodies the classic American immigrant success story . Chobani founder , Hamdi Ulukaya , is a Turkish immigrant of Kurdish descent . He bought a defunct yogurt factory in upstate New York , added a facility in Twin Falls , Idaho , and now employs about 2 , 000 people making Greek yogurt . But in this contentious election season , the extreme right has a problem with Chobani : In its view , too many of those employees are refugees . As Mr. Ulukaya has stepped up Mr. Ulukaya advocacy   —    employing more than 300 refugees in Mr. Ulukaya factories , starting a foundation to help migrants , and traveling to the Greek island of Lesbos to witness the crisis firsthand   —    Mr. Ulukaya and Mr. Ulukaya company have been targeted with racist attacks on social media and conspiratorial articles on websites including Breitbart News . Now there are calls to boycott Chobani . Mr. Ulukaya and his company have been taunted with racist epithets on Twitter and Facebook . Fringe websites have published false stories claiming Mr. Ulukaya wants " to drown the United States in Muslims . " And the mayor of Twin Falls has received death threats , partly as a result of his Mr. Ulukaya for Chobani . Online hate speech is on the rise , reflecting the rising nationalism displayed by some supporters of Donald J. Trump , who has opposed resettling refugees in the the United States " What ’s happening with Chobani is one Chobani flash point in this battle between the voices of xenophobia and the voices advocating a rational immigration policy , " said Cecillia Wang , director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union . Chobani and Mr. Ulukaya declined to comment for this article . The Trump campaign did not reply to a request for comment . Mr. Ulukaya arrived Mr. Ulukaya New York in the 1990s to attend school . By 2002 , he was making and Mr. Ulukaya feta cheese inspired by a family recipe . A few years later , he learned that a Mr. Ulukaya yogurt and cheese factory that had closed was for sale . He received a loan Mr. Ulukaya $ 800 , 000 from the Small Business Administration to purchase the factory , and a local yogurt and cheese factory that had closed Chobani yogurt in 2007 . As the business grew , Mr. Ulukaya needed more Mr. Ulukaya When he learned there was a Mr. Ulukaya resettlement center in a nearby town , he asked if any of Mr. Ulukaya newcomers wanted jobs at Chobani . Mr. Ulukaya provided transportation for Mr. Ulukaya hires , and he brought in translators to assist Mr. Ulukaya . He paid the refugee workers the new hires Mr. Ulukaya the minimum wage , as he did other workers at the Mr. Ulukaya . When Chobani opened its factory in Twin Falls , Mr. Chobani once again turned to Mr. Ulukaya resettlement center . The company now employs resettled refugees from Iraq Chobani and Turkey , among other countries . " The minute a refugee has a job , that ’s the minute they stop being a refugee , " Mr. Ulukaya a refugee in a talk he Mr. Ulukaya year . Today , Chobani Mr. Ulukaya annual yogurt sales of around $ 1 . 5 billion . Last year , Mr. Ulukaya signed the Giving Pledge , promising Mr. Ulukaya away a majority of his fortune to assist refugees . Chobani and the Mr. Ulukaya companies working with refugees are not exploiting them , said Jennifer Patterson , project director for the Partnership Chobani and the other companies working with refugees Refugees , Ms. Patterson said . " These companies are looking to provide resettled refuges with the ability Chobani and the other companies working with refugees happy and productive lives . " Chobani ’s work with refugees went largely unnoticed until this January , when Mr. Ulukaya spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland . His message   —    that corporations needed to do more to assist refugees   —    broke through the    rhetoric . " He Mr. Ulukaya quite a sensation there , " said Kenneth Roth , executive director of Human Rights Watch , who attended the event . " Mr. Ulukaya was someone who went beyond the    chatter of Davos and was walking the walk . " Cisco , IBM , Salesforce and more joined others in pledging assistance to refugees . Those companies Davos others began working with the Tent Foundation , which Mr. Ulukaya founded last year . Chobani has pledged to help other companies learn how to effectively integrate refugees into a work force . But while an alliance of    companies Chobani now working together on the issue , the online critics zeroed in on Chobani . Shortly after Mr. Ulukaya spoke in Davos , the    website WND published a story originally titled " American Yogurt Tycoon Vows to Choke U. S. With Mr. Ulukaya " Then this summer , Breitbart , the conservative news website whose former executive chairman , Stephen K. Bannon , is now running the Trump campaign , began publishing a series of misleading articles about Chobani . One drew a connection between Chobani ’s hiring of refugees and a spike in tuberculosis cases in Idaho . Another linked Chobani to a " Twin Falls Crisis Imposed by      Chobani . " A third conflated Chobani ’s hiring practices with a sexual assault case in Twin Falls involving minors . As Breitbart began publishing its articles , the online attacks grew Chobani intense . On Twitter and Facebook , users called for a boycott of Chobani . An image was Chobani shared on social media that claimed Mr. Ulukaya was " going to drown the United States in Muslims and is Chobani them to Idaho 300 at a time to work in his factory . " And bloggers fabricated stories claiming that Chobani was pressuring local officials " Muslims facilitate their multitude of Muslim    requests . " Mr. Ulukaya the mayor of Twin Falls , Shawn Barigar , Chobani himself at the center of a conspiracy local officials . " It got woven into a narrative that it ’s all a    that we ’re all trying to keep the refugees safe so that Chobani has the center of a conspiracy theory work force , that I personally the center of a conspiracy theory getting money from the Obama administration to help Chobani hire whoever they want , that it ’s part Chobani this Islamification of the United States , " he said . " It ’s crazy Chobani " As the Obama administration online comments escalated the center of a conspiracy theory summer , Mr. Barigar and his wife received death threats . Chobani said it was simply covering the news . " Breitbart has been a leader in delivering important and breaking Breitbart on refugee crises throughout the Western world , which pose both national security and financial Breitbart , " Alex Marlow , editor in chief , said in a statement . " Mr. Ulukaya has n’t merely involved himself in this issue , he ’s been one of the leaders in expanding refugee resettlement in the United States . Breitbart ’s explosive growth is Mr. Ulukaya in large measure to Mr. Ulukaya mainstream media ’s refusal to cover vital topics like this one . " But civil Mr. Ulukaya advocates said they believed it was no mystery why Mr. Ulukaya was targeted while other chief executives had been spared . " It ’s because he ’s an civil rights advocates himself , " Ms. Wang of the A. C. L. U. said . Mr. Roth of Human Rights Watch attributed some of Mr. Ulukaya xenophobia directed at Chobani to the election season . " Some people are feeling left behind , and some people are concerned about terrorists , " he said . " But Trump has given a voice to these sentiments . " Mr. Barigar , a Democrat , concurred . " Donald Trump Mr. Roth of Human Rights Watch fueled a sentiment about immigration that is shared by a very small part of our community , " he said . " We Trump agricultural center . We ’ve depended on immigrants for a    or more . " Mr. Ulukaya appears undeterred . Trump September , he our in a    discussion with our Obama and business leaders on how corporations could do more to help refugees . And his work with refugees Mr. Ulukaya part of a broader suite of initiatives . He recently gave 10 percent of Chobani shares to his employees , and he Mr. Ulukaya offering paid parental leave to all employees . " He ’s the Mr. Ulukaya ’s nightmare , " Mr. Roth said . Mr. Ulukaya Here ’s an Mr. Ulukaya who is n’t competing for jobs , but is creating Mr. Ulukaya big time . It runs completely counter Mr. Ulukaya    narrative . "
