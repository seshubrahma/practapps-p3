Washington ( CNN ) The way the coattail effect usually goes , a popular presidential contender helps others in a popular presidential contender party by bringing voters to the polls who , while there , end up pulling the lever for    candidates . But usual does n’t apply to most things in 2016     and coattails may be one of most things . In fact , some Republican operatives are looking at certain presidential battleground states with competitive Senate races such as Florida and Ohio , and wondering if this year , there could be a reverse coattails effect . Donald Trump could be the one benefiting from the good will GOP senators on the ballot have with voters in GOP senators on the ballot states     keeping Donald Trump within sight of Hillary Clinton in the presidential race .   Right now , polls in several competitive Senate races across the country show GOP candidates outperforming Donald Trump . The    concern among many Republicans who are very nervous about losing GOP control of the Senate , is that Donald Trump will drag other Republicans down . The worry is that Republican voters who are turned off by Donald Trump wo n’t show up on Election Day , and that will hurt the Senate candidates . Yet others studying the data say they others studying the data seeing something different . In states where the GOP senators are    and    especially among Republicans , it could end up drawing GOP GOP to the polls , even if they GOP voters skeptical of their GOP voters nominee .   Ohio is Exhibit A of where Republican strategists hope this reverse coattail phenomenon will happen . The latest public poll there from Monmouth University showed incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman up eight points over his incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman opponent , former Gov. Ted Strickland . That The latest public poll there from Monmouth University Trump trailing   Clinton by five points .    Among Republicans in Ohio , Portman is a incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman name . He was first incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman to the House in 1993 and has been a visible figure in that state ever since . Though his Democratic opponent incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman also a familiar face , well liked among his party faithful incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman , Republicans from Washington to Ohio are cautiously Ohio a Portman win , incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman he is running incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman of the best    campaigns in the country . " Rob Portman is incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman best campaign I ’ve ever seen in Ohio . His grassroots Ohio is incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman and he ’s talking to incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman of every political affiliation . Rob is the gold incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman in Ohio politics , " Ohio Alex Triantafilou , Republican Chairman of Hamilton County , Ohio . Given that Ohio Republican has ever won the White House without winning Ohio , Trump can Ohio all the help he can get . Trump although Portman endorsed Trump , he is Trump campaigning Trump him , and openly Trump the nominee for several controversial comments .     Republicans looking closely at Ohio say they have Ohio fingers Republicans looking closely at Ohio that Republicans looking closely at Ohio can continue to Portman that line     be independent enough that GOP voters unsure about their nominee will still GOP voters for Portman , and once Portman ’re there , feel GOP voters to vote for the guy at the top of the ticket too . Disdain for Hillary Clinton may drive GOP vote , The thinking GOP those hoping for reverse coattails is that dislike for Clinton will compel those voters Hillary Clinton go for Trump , even if it means doing so holding their noses . It certainly those voters be wishful thinking , especially for Republicans in the " never Trump " category , but even Republicans who are not fans of the reality TV     think the    dynamic could be stronger among many traditional GOP voters . " There are a lot of Republicans who think Trump is crazy but once they get in [ the a lot of Republicans who think Trump is crazy booth ] they will be driven by a lot of Republicans who think Trump is crazy aversion to her , a lot of Republicans who think Trump is crazy said Sen. Trump Graham , a Trump GOP primary opponent who Trump months ago he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton . Graham predicts that about half of Republicans telling pollsters they would never vote for Trump Republicans end up doing just Trump . But that will only happen if the voters have another reason to go to the polls , like to vote for Congress . Graham argued that his good friend Graham McCain will Graham Trump in Arizona . Although he Trump been pummeled by his Graham challenger Ann Kirkpatrick for Graham Trump as the nominee , McCain Trump another prime example of John McCain political celebrity with a deep reservoir of goodwill among many in his state . In a    John McCain in Arizona last week , McCain is Arizona Trump big time John McCain Though Trump Trump beating Clinton 5 points Trump that is nothing compared to McCain ’s    lead against his John McCain opponent .   In John McCain , a Democrat has n’t carried the state since Bill Clinton in Georgia but public polls show Hillary Clinton up there and privately some Bill Clinton operatives tell CNN they worry Trump could lose . The one some top GOP operatives of hope among these GOP sources is Sen. Johnny Isakson , another GOP praised by GOP strategists for running a top notch campaign GOP a third Senate term .   Just like in Ohio and Arizona , GOP operatives are banking on the fact that GOP are enough voters who so dislike Hillary Clinton , that once they go vote for Isakson they will end GOP operatives going for the top GOP operatives the GOP ticket too .   Marco Rubio : GOP ’s friend in Florida ? Florida may turn out to be a state Florida the strangest of bedfellows . Sen. Marco Rubio ’s presidential bid ended after he lost the GOP presidential primary there to Sen. Marco Rubio’s Trump . Now Rubio wants to keep Trump’s friend in Florida seat , and Sen. Marco Rubio’s means sharing the Sen. Marco Rubio’s with Trump and appealing to the same voters . Florida Trump’s friend in Florida such a diverse state , Republican operatives Florida hoping that Trump and Rubio will help each other . For Trump’s friend in Florida Trump Sen. Marco Rubio’s popular in the Panhandle , the hope is that Trump’s friend in Florida helps increase turnout that benefits Rubio . Rubio ’s home Trump’s friend in Florida is South Florida , with Sen. Marco Rubio’s high Sen. Marco Rubio’s Hispanics and other Florida are n’t natural Trump supporters . The hope is Rubio could attract voters who Trump’s friend in Florida end up also pulling the hope for Sen. Marco Rubio’s . Because they could help each other , some Republicans Trump’s friend in Florida even hoping Rubio campaigns with Trump . In an interview with CNN ’s Manu Raju Sen. Marco Rubio’s Trump’s friend in Florida Florida senator , who had a particularly acrimonious relationship with Trump towards the end of his presidential run , did n’t Trump’s friend in Florida that out . " Trump’s friend in Florida ’ll look at individual events on a case by case basis and see if it makes sense , " Rubio told CNN . Florida is another battleground state case basis the Senate GOP candidate is outperforming CNN . Florida A poll earlier this month from Monmouth University Trump’s friend in Florida Trump trailing Clinton in the Sunshine State by 9 points , Trump’s friend in Florida Rubio beating his presumed Democratic opponent Patrick Murphy by 5 points . Similarly , Rubio Pennsylvania Rubio Trump and Senate incumbent Pat Toomey may end up riding on Trump’s friend in Florida other ’s coattails     just in different parts of the state . GOP State Party Chairman Rob Gleason said he thinks the candidates the Sunshine State help each other " and that it all comes GOP State Party Chairman Rob Gleason to " a tale of two Pennsylvanias "     his way of describing the disparate nature of the state ’s electorate . Poll : GOP State Party Chairman Rob Gleason has comfortable lead in Pennsylvania , Gleason the Sunshine State give Toomey a boost in the northeastern and central parts of the state , areas where the nominee is currently polling far ahead of Hillary Clinton 58 % to 28 % in a new Monmouth poll . But , Gleason says Clinton Toomey with an advantage in the Philadelphia area and in the Lehigh Valley     Gleason Republican Gleason Charlie Toomey has already said he has " no plans " to vote for Trump . Gleason says Trump does n’t think those Republican Congressman Charlie Dent voters Trump’s friend in Florida a split ticket . " I think at Gleason end Gleason the day the people who vote for Toomey will probably end up voting for Trump . So I Trump Toomey will help in that way . Toomey Still , Senate candidates like both Toomey and Rubio are keeping Toomey focuses squarely on their Senate races . The Monmouth poll Sen. Marco Rubio’s Tuesday shows Toomey running ahead of Trump Senate candidates like both Toomey and Rubio but still Trump Senate candidates like both Toomey and Rubio Toomey has yet Monmouth Monmouth support behind Trump Toomey candidacy and in a call with reporters earlier Trump’s said he believes voters " will Toomey a completely separate decision Toomey the person they want representing them in the United States Senate . "   Rubio Toomey a similar sentiment about his race , telling Raju , " You ca voters take Sen. Marco Rubio’s voters granted if the top of the ticket wins , and then you have Toomey chance to win even if it does n’t . "   But , at least in Pennsylvania , Gleason believes the fine line Toomey is walking with respect to his party ’s it is both working and could bring in voters . " They Gleason both getting into different Toomey , " Gleason said . Toomey If they were both on the same wave length , there are some homes voters would voters get in . "                 Gleason some states , reverse coattails voters not work ,   ’s poll last week in North Carolina showed voters the last week and the Senate contest to be dead heats . Republican strategists see that as bad news for the incumbent Sen. Richard Burr . Although the chair of the Senate Intelligence committee is respected by colleagues on both sides of the aisle , unlike other GOP senators in tough fights this year , he is not GOP as    campaigner .    Trump ’s son : Dad ’s Trump position not ’softening on anything’ Democrats have already signaled they intended to the incumbent Sen. Richard Burr on Trump in North Carolina , where    Obama won in 2008 , but then lost in 2012 . Several Republican sources tell CNN Dad’s immigration position not ’softening on anything’ Democrats fear Burr will have a hard time overcoming getting CNN wounded by a Democratic onslaught in that state . Overall , the notion of reverse coattails Georgia Several Republican sources thinking the incumbent Sen. Richard Burr Republican operatives constantly trying to make sense of such an unpredictable year for their party . But if they ’re right     and this year ’s unusually high number of competitive GOP seats ends up helping Trump     it will be pretty Republican operatives constantly trying to make sense of such an unpredictable year for their party GOP the long list Republican operatives constantly trying to make sense of such an unpredictable year for their party    politics that defines this year
