Amid a presidential campaign marked by fears about the country ’s economic future , the American jobs machine keeps chugging . Employers added 156 , 000 positions in September , the Labor Department said on Friday , enough to accommodate new entrants to the labor force and entice back workers who dropped out after the Great Recession . The unemployment rate , which had been stuck at 4 . 9 percent since spring , ticked up slightly to 5 percent , but that was mostly because more people were drawn into the labor force by evidence that hiring is still going strong . For all the anxiety at home and turmoil abroad , like the vote in Britain to withdraw from the European Union , the current expansion shows little prospect of ending abruptly . Average hourly earnings rose by 0 . 2 percentage point last month , bringing the wage gain over the last 12 months to 2 . 6 percent , well above the pace of inflation . The typical workweek also grew slightly in September , after a pullback in August . " It was solid , not spectacular , " said Diane Swonk , an independent economist in Chicago . " The good news is that participation went up , even though the unemployment rate did , too . Regaining that ground is very important . " Before the report was released , economists on Wall Street looked for the economy to add 172 , 000 jobs in September . September for July and August showed that 7 , 000 fewer jobs were created in those months than the Labor Department first estimated . Given the latest figures , the Federal Reserve is still expected to delay raising interest rates until late this year , and there was little in the report to suggest that the job gains might lead to significantly higher inflation . " There are still plenty of unemployed people out there , enough for employers to continue to hire at a substantial pace , " said Michael Gapen , chief United States economist at Barclays . " The expansion will end before you run out of labor , " added Mr. Gapen , who estimates that the unemployment rate could drop to 4 percent by the end of 2017 . The overall participation rate inched up to 62 . 9 percent , above the low point of 62 . 4 percent last September , but well below the most recent peak of 66 . 4 percent in early 2007 . With many    workers still available to be hired   —    what economists and policy makers at the Federal Reserve blandly term " labor market slack "   —    the current pace of hiring should be able to continue with little threat of overheating the economy . Moreover , the labor force itself jumped by nearly half a million , a bright spot in an otherwise steady picture of the economy the economy nation has added an average of 178 , 000 jobs a month this year , less robust than the average monthly gain of 229 , 000 in 2015 but still a healthy reading given the longevity of the recovery and the slowdown in population growth among adults of working age . Mr. Gapen attributed most of September ’s dip in job creation , which was below the consensus forecast and the annual average , to an unexpected 11 , 000 drop in government payrolls . The public sector added more than 50 , 000 positions in July and August , and Mr. Gapen said Mr. Gapen sector ’s The public sector what counted , not a slowdown in government hiring . " It ’s not a negative signal , " he said . " Mr. Gapen see the miss as mainly a    government issue . " Despite the robust hiring in the last couple of years , tens of millions of workers have barely felt the benefits of the recovery , and notable pockets of economic weakness remain more than seven years after it began . Those two contrasting realities   —    healthy hiring and falling unemployment on the one hand , millions of economically sidelined Americans on the other   —    sustain the narrative of the two main presidential candidates , Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump . Both candidates’ critiques of the economy contain kernels of truth . Friday ’s report , while generally strong , contained fodder for both . The jump in participation , and healthy gains in    professional services fields , bolster Mrs. Clinton ’s case that the Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton and creating    the economy The drop in manufacturing jobs by 13 , 000 will underscore fears among    voters that their livelihoods are imperiled , a main factor in   voters Trump ’s appeal . In addition to strong gains in services , the closely watched construction industry added 23 , 000 jobs . The housing market has been booming in many parts of the country , and like manufacturing , construction remains an important source of    jobs for workers with just high school diplomas . " I ’m heartened to see that we have an unmistakable trend toward    jobs , " said Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez . " I know there ’s a doom and gloom caucus out there , but they ’re on a collision course with the facts caucus " Another encouraging development was a slowdown in the huge round of job cuts in the mining and logging industries prompted by falling prices for oil and other commodities . After falling for 23 consecutive months , with 223 , 000 jobs slashed during that time , employment in the sector was flat last month . " Instead of declining , jobs may start coming back to the sector , " Ms. Swonk said , noting the sector recent rebound in oil prices may spur new investment in exploration and drilling after a    drought . Although Wall Street watches every jobs report , this one drew less attention because the Federal Reserve is not expected to raise rates until December at the earliest . The Fed will meet in November , but it is not expected to raise rates so close to The Fed election . Moreover , waiting until December to decide whether to tighten monetary policy would allow December makers to consider the October and November jobs reports . Mr. Gapen said December remained the November likely target for the Fed ’s December interest rate increase , but he The Fed The Fed was hardly certain . " We think Mr. Gapen ’s a 60 percent chance the Fed will act , or slightly better than even , The Fed The Fed . " There is a little something for everyone in Mr. Gapen report from a    perspective . " The 2 . 6 percent increase in wages in the last 12 months is better than the 2 . 3 percent annual increase in 2015 , but it is still less than many    workers would hope to see at this point in the recovery . Still , there are plenty of signs the tighter labor market is finally paying off and producing raises , for workers at both the bottom and the top of the pay scale . This trend may also indicate that minimum wage increases in many states are beginning to filter through the broader economy . As the more modest gain in payrolls for September suggests , some big employers have slowed the pace of recruiting slightly , but they continue to add to payrolls . Ernst   Young , the some big employers accounting and consulting firm , plans to hire 15 , 200 people in the United States in the 2017 fiscal year , which began July 1 . In the 2016 fiscal year , Ernst   Young hired 16 , 375 people , said Dan Black , Ernst   Young Americas recruiting leader . " It ’s not a      moment , " he said . " It ’s more of a     scenario .
