If the political establishment in Washington continues to work against the will of the bases of both the GOP and the Democratic Party , a leading progressive organizer says that America may be headed for the possibility of a legitimate third party that comprises a    populist coalition . [ Aaron Black , the progressive organizer and Occupy Wall Street veteran , joined Breitbart News Saturday with guest host and Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle on Saturday to kick off the show . After Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle asked Black about the populist uprisings in both parties represented by supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Party and billionaire Donald Trump in the Republican Party , Black suggested a third party may emerge if the establishment continues working against the people .   Black said on the air : Sanders and Trump have a lot of supporters for that very reason : Sanders and Trump ’re not being bought and paid for by corporate interests . I will say that we need to go a little further , I think that somebody like Trump who is    has an advantage over a lot of people who would like to run for President as an example . I do n’t want to see a scenario where in another four years the only people who can run for our highest office are billionaires . There needs to be some kind of cap on what you can spend . I think that this has to be equal , somehow . The two party system has been disastrous to our country   …     . I personally would like to see the Republican Party come out of this . Boyle followed up , asking Black to " flesh that idea out " and whether he Boyle " a coalition between the populist right and populist left . " Black Black he Black n’t sure yet , but the more the establishment continues this activity against Trump in the Republican Party and against Sanders in the Democratic Party , the more they Black at risk of something like this . " Well , I do n’t know what it looks like , " Black Black . " I just think the two party system has been disastrous for our country . I think it the two party system time something gives . I ’m not suggesting we do away with the two parties   —    the Democratic or Republican party   —    right now , but what I am saying is that we we need a third party to even things out . " Black Black played a leading role in organizing protests around the our country including the thousands who turned out on Thursday to " shut down Trump . " When asked what he hoped to accomplish with the protests , Black Black : Well I think people are dissatisfied in general , they feel people they do people have a voice . Their government people bought and paid for by Wall Street firms and K Street lobbyists . The bottom line is that this really is n’t a partisan issue , people are just fed up and are tired of getting screwed . Black Black announced that he Black to join other activists who ’ve been arrested during the last week as part of the " Democracy Spring " in Washington D. C. " We ’re going to continue that over the weekend , people will sit on the Capitol Steps , and shockingly that ’s illegal , " Black Black . " They ’ve people close to nine hundred of us on We steps for simply sitting there saying that this unjust . We want We person , one vote , we ’ve We enough .
