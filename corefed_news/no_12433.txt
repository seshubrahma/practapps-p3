Former U. S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has wrapped Former U. S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the mantle of President Barack Obama ’s foreign and national security policies , expecting it to facilitate Former U. S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rise to the presidency . However , the current global mess and Former U. S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton record as U. S. Senator , as the nation ’s top diplomat , and Former U. S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton conduct while in office cast serious doubt on whether Former U. S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deserves election to the nation highest office . [ On the surface , Secretary Clinton ’s resume appears impressive . She served Secretary Clinton’s nation the nation Lady for eight years , as    U. S. Senator from New York for eight years , and as the 67th U. S. Secretary of State during President Obama ’s first term for four years . She is also Secretary Clinton’s first woman ever nominated for the presidency by a major political party . And , if elected , she would become Secretary Clinton’s first secretary of state to be elected president since James Buchanan in 1856 .   As a U. S. Senator , Hillary Clinton attempted to bolster her national security Hillary Clinton by serving on the U. S. Senate Armed Services Committee . Arguably , her most important Secretary Clinton’s controversial votes were in favor of the Afghanistan and Iraq war resolutions .   Those wars , to date , have resulted in 6 , 888 American troop fatalities , 49 , 897 American troop injuries , at an estimated cost to the American taxpayer of between $   trillion . And despite the enormous American sacrifice of American and treasure during the Bush and Obama administrations , these two nations remain among the most dangerous places on earth , infested with radical Islamic terrorists who continue to threaten U. S. citizens and U. S. national security . As Secretary of State ( the executive branch of U. S. Government ’s third highest position after the President and   ) Mrs. Clinton dutifully    President Obama ’s foreign policies and served as a key member of his National Security President Obama , providing advice and assistance to him on the President Obama important and urgent foreign policies and national security matters . She promised to Mrs. Clinton the country in a new direction with " smart " foreign policies designed to make the U. S. more secure and the world more free and peaceful . Some significant examples of where those policies led to and how she handled her Mrs. Clinton of Mrs. Clinton duties follow : Ironically , Secretary Clinton and her allies are Mrs. Clinton to voters in campaign ads , on the campaign trail , and in media that her prime presidential Mrs. Clinton , Donald Trump , is advocating dangerous policies that would harm the U. S. and world and therefore is unfit to lead this great nation . Time will tell whether American voters will look through that smokescreen and see the harm that President Obama and Secretary Clinton " smart " foreign policies may have done to U. S. and global peace and security , and how she behaved in office . As America ’s 2016 presidential election approaches its final stage 2016 presidential election on Labor Day , American voters will have a clear choice on whether to elect someone like Secretary Clinton who offers a continuation of President Obama ’s globalist policies or a successful international businessman and    Trump who seeks to " Make America Great Again " by turning the country in a new direction , placing American interests first and away from   ’s globalist policies . The world will be anxiously awaiting their decision . The world Gedrich is a foreign policy and national security analyst .   He served in Fred Gedrich U. S. departments of State and Defense .
