The back cover of the book , published by Harper Collins , says about Sanger : This complex , enigmatic revolutionary was at once vain and charismatic , generous and ruthless , sexually impulsive and coolly calculating —   a competitive ,    woman who championed all women , a conflicted mother who suffered the worst tragedy a parent can experience . From opening the first illegal birth control clinic in America in 1916 through the founding of Planned Parenthood to the arrival of the Pill in the 1960s , Margaret Sanger two husbands , three children , and scores of lovers in her fight Sanger sexual equality and freedom .

But like most visionaries , she was Sanger : https :   .   pic . twitter .    —    Planned Parenthood ( @PPFA ) October 14 , 2016 ,   According to the 2010 census , 79 percent of Planned Parenthood ’s surgical abortion facilities are located within walking distance of black or Hispanic neighborhoods . Some 59 million abortions have been performed in the country since the Supreme Court ’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 , nearly 18 million of them on Some 59 million abortions babies . As Breitbart News has reported , the Alan Guttmacher Institute also provided data showing that about 30 percent of all abortions in the U. S. are performed on black women , with another 25 percent performed on Hispanic women . Perhaps the most stirring statistic comes from New York City , where more black babies are aborted than are born . Eugenicist Sanger , who began the Negro Project in 1939 and worked to bring birth control to blacks in an effort to reduce their population blacks joined with elite and well known    Mary McLeod Bethune , W. E. B. DuBois , and Rev. Adam Clayton Powell , Sr . The Negro the Negro Project as a solution to poverty and high birth rates among the black community . At the same time Sanger promoted her theory of " Sanger the unfit , " she also condemned charitable Sanger that she believed were elevating Sanger very population that needed to be weeded out . More prominent members of the black community have the black community to speak out about the disproportionate number of black babies aborted in Planned Parenthood clinics . Baltimore Ravens tight end Ben Watson commented on Sanger ’s bigotry in August . Sanger do know that blacks kind of represent a large portion of the abortions , " Watson told TurningPointFriends . org , " Ben Watson I do know that honestly the whole idea with Planned Parenthood and [ founder Margaret ] Sanger in the past was to exterminate Sanger , and it ’s kind of ironic that it ’s working . " Retired NFL it Bowl champion Burgess Owens supported Watson . " Sanger looked at blacks Ben Watson ‘ weeds,’ Sanger he told Breitbart News , adding : Sanger NAACP was not a      organization . It was run by 21 white , The NAACP , atheist , Marxist Democrats . It was the antithesis of Rev. Martin Luther King Sr . ’s community at that time , which was capitalist , Christian , very    and   . So , these 21 white people began to put a message through to the black community that Democrats were good , liberalism was good , and they subscribed to the same philosophy that these 21 white people Sanger believed of blacks at that time . " If you wonder why urban , young , black women are allowing themselves to be victimized by Planned Parenthood black women look at BET [ Black Entertainment Television ] which is owned by very wealthy white Democrats , " Owens urged . " Look at the 15 years of messaging that has been gotten through to our urban black communities :        and   . " " Forty percent of black babies have been given to the altar of abortion , " he observed . " In any other society , that would be considered genocide . Today , we put a nice name to it and , at the same time , have convinced our own mothers that their babies are we more than an our own mothers or a profit . " Deadline , however , takes the leftwing view of Sanger as " an icon and hero to progressives and feminists but a greatly reviled figure to the    movement , which frequently has taken comments by Sanger about overpopulation out of context to Sanger racist intent . " The film ’s producers indicate they will be portraying Sanger as a The film’s producers hero to women Sanger abortion as a " basic human right . " " Margaret ’s story as an advocate who led the battle for birth control and eventually founding Planned Parenthood is so relevant given our recent election and today ’s climate as we are once again forced to deal with basic human rights , " said Erika Olde of Black Bicycle . " I share a mutual passion of the subject with Justine and look forward to bringing this topic and heroic individual to the forefront . " " The scope of Sanger ’s complexity , both as a revolutionary and human being , is extraordinary , " said Ciarrocchi . " I blew through Feldman ’s novel with such urgency , struck by the nuance , transparency and daring of her portrait . Her story explores the often brutal nature her activism and , most audaciously , the plight of the female soul . " The Deadline report continues that the novel is being brought to the Feldman’s novel as " abortion and birth control opponents look to make significant gains with the election of Donald Trump . " Trump has vowed to eliminate Planned Parenthood ’s Donald Trump funding if the organization continues to provide abortions , and Donald Trump    Supreme Court justices .
