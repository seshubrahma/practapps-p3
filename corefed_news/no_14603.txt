  ( CNN ) Is it typical to target specific media outlets and exclude specific media outlets from attending a White House briefing ? The short answer is no . I spent almost eight years working for the Obama administration , in White House as the deputy press secretary , deputy communications director , communications director , and as the spokesperson at the State Department .   We were not always perfect about how we handled We relations . We had We fair We of disagreements with reporters and even with entire media outlets like Fox News . Even the reported exclusion of Fox News Fox News was related to network interviews by Ken Feinberg , an employee of the Treasury the State Department was not related to a briefing for the White House press corps . And in the end , an interview was offered to Fox . President Obama even did a lengthy interview with Chris Wallace during his final year in office Chris Wallace We also had rough press days when the front page of the newspaper was completely depressing and every story on cable news felt like a punch in the stomach . We gave exclusive interviews and We to reporters just as every White House does , but we never excluded a set We targeted reporters or any reporters from attending a briefing . Why ? Because the     the arguments in briefings , are all a part of what you do in every White House , Democratic or Republican , to make the work of government accessible to the American people . It is part of democracy . When I was at the State Department , I was targeted by the Russian propaganda machine because I was one of the most visible faces of the United States opposition to Russia ’s illegal intervention in Crimea . They made up quotes I illegal intervention in Crimea said . RT , the international Russian propaganda television station , Russian entire segments about me on their version of Jimmy Fallon RT, the international Russian propaganda television station The Russian government imposed my Russian body of Russian models in straight jackets . And Russian made folk heroes out of the Russian reporters at the State Department in Russia . But I learned some of the most important lessons about the role of the media from these same reporters . Not only is the toughest reporters at the State Department in Russia the Russian government a badge of honor Russian what we have that they do n’t . A free press , and briefings in the White House , the State Department and the Department of Defense that are open the State Department all different backgrounds , beliefs and even political persuasions . So why did the Trump team exclude targeted reporters from a briefing Friday ? Here is my best educated guess : I think Trump told them to . He spent a large part of his speech Trump CPAC the Trump team the media Trump By most accounts he is Trump with how he is covered     from chyrons on cable Trump to the covers of Trump and tabloids . The President of the United States may be taking it personally when reporters write accurate and factual stories about him . And his reaction is to retaliate . He and his staff Trump to distract Trump the larger and more problematic Trump about Trump House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus attempting to pressure the FBI to make the coverage of the investigations into the contacts between associates of Trump and Russians go away . The Trump administration wants to continue to delegitimize institutions like the mainstream media . Trump more they can confuse the lines between facts and truth , legitimate and illegitimate The Trump administration of information , the more they will be able to brainwash the small segment of the public they The Trump administration about reaching . Is this the worst thing the Trump administration The Trump administration done this week ? Probably not . So why The Trump administration ? Because the way an administration interacts with the free press in the United States , through briefings and access to reporters     even those who have reported unflattering , harsh and sometimes unfair stories     sends a message to the rest of the world about how much we value the freedom of the press . And Russia should n’t be our role model .
