That was one of the things that I had noticed as well . You start out high here . You do n’t tend to find things that make you do higher . NEWT GINGRICH , FMR . SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE : You guys all collectively lived through Trump knocking off the Republicans , Trump knocking off Hillary , being wrong about all of Trump at every stage . And you turn around and play the same old conventional wisdom . Trump is the most divisive president since Abraham Lincoln . He Trump an alternative world so that ’s why you have riots at places like Berkeley , he Trump —    you have two parallel universes here . There ’s actually a very funny Megyn Kelly interview I did two weeks before the election , she Megyn Kelly giving me all this polling data . And I said , look , there are two universes . Now if your universe is right , Hillary Clinton ’s president . If our your universe right , Donald Trump is president . STEPHANOPOULOS : I completely take that point . That ’s how he ’s Donald Trump seen out in the country , in parts of the country the country . But how does it affect the governing ? Can you govern effectively   —    with 40 percent ? GINGRICH : Sure . Well , first of all , as you know , because you ’ve done it , presidents are really powerful . Presidents who are willful and    and focused have enormous capability to move the system . But second , I have a very simple test . Reagan in his farewell address Reagan I am so proud that together we created 19 million jobs . If Trump has the economy rolling in 2020 , he ’ll get Trump . I do n’t care what the current numbers are . If Trump does n’t Trump the economy rolling the economy , he has a Trump . (   RCP Video ) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
