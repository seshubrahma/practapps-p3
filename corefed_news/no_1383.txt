According to the rules of modern marketing , every company , like every    superhero or extreme villain , must be able to communicate an origin story . Among    origin stories , while meant to lend distinction , tend instead to achieve a blurring sameness . Someone   —    a visionary   —    experiences or observes a material privation that prompts an epiphany . This typically happens while on a sofa , or in a bar or a dorm room or on a hilltop in Bhutan , after which the visionary , instead of merely saying " huh , " wondering about the next episode of " Vanderpump Rules , " and never giving the revelation another thought , begins the task of mounting an empire . The story of Warby Parker more or less conforms to this narrative : One of the young    lost the young    glasses on a backpacking trip , discovered that they were too expensive to replace , squinted for months and then , with friends who could relate , built a company in 2010 with the goal of producing    glasses that did n’t cost many hundreds of dollars . Warby Parker has done very well , opening stores across the country that evoke libraries ( another , most recently in Cobble Hill , Brooklyn ) and generally distilling    branding to its    . Each pair of glasses seems to say , " I do n’t know anyone who has ever met anyone who has ever thought about voting for Donald Trump . " Imagine how you would feel , though , if you had been selling eyewear for decades , and your origin story dated not to the era of Malia Obama ’s    years but to the period of Ellis Island arrivals and mass emigration from Minsk . Both Moscot and Cohen ’s Fashion Optical are New York institutions that began as pushcart businesses , with immigrant founders   —    Hyman Moscot and Abe Cohen   —    selling eyeglasses on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the early 20th century . Their flagship stores are    from each other on Orchard and Delancey Streets . Moscots and Cohens still run the businesses , and they Moscots and Cohens been forced to respond to Warby Parker ’s Occupy Eyewear agenda . This month , Gary Gerber , the host of the Internet radio program " The Power Hour , " which bills itself as " optometry ’s only live radio show , " interviewed Harvey Moscot , who explained to listeners outside New York that as a purveyor of eyewear in Manhattan , " you are at the center of optical chaos . " Moscot has responded to the feverish competition by outstylizing everyone else , remodeling its Moscot East Side store three years ago to look like a steampunk fantasy island . The vibe is so steeped in history and authenticity that it The vibe Warby Parker look like a T. G. I. Friday ’s . Moscot Moscot also expanded internationally , opening a branch in London in December . Cohen ’s faces the challenge of trying to seem hip as a franchise business with 130 stores . Cohen Cohen’s , unlike Moscot Moscot Warby Parker , sells brands that are not its Cohen’s ( Gucci , Tom Ford and so on ) . A few weeks ago , however , it Cohen’s selling a house line called the Collective simple frames that are meant to look as if they come with a free Smith Corona , and sell for under $ 100 . Cohen Cohen’s remodeled its flagship Cohen’s , outfitting it with its flagship store tiles and making it look its flagship store the kind of place a recent graduate of a    liberal arts college might come to shop . Recently , I sat down with Bob Cohen , who runs Cohen ’s Cohen’s at Katz ’s Delicatessen on the Lower East Side . The place place at lunchtime and has thrived by not changing anything , not recalibrating , not making vegan pastrami . In the 1970s , the neighborhood was excluded from laws that kept many stores closed on Sundays , and Cohen ’s Cohen’s the most of it . People the neighborhood come from Westchester County and New Jersey and Long Island to shop , and Cohen ’s Cohen’s offering    service so that customers could go home with their glasses the customers afternoon . So how can a business like Cohen ’s Cohen’s itself in this particular moment ? It is Mr. Cohen Cohen’s his company can prevail Cohen’s You do n’t go to Warby Parker for fashion , " he said . " It ’s Warby Parker very basic product . " This , of course , misreads the extent to which antifashion is fashion . As an aesthetic , antifashion as fashion is annoying and alienating , as many people who are over 40 , not particularly slender or less prestigiously schooled can attest when visiting a Warby Parker outlet . There is Warby Parker a relatively low price , but a sense of exclusion is woven into the gestalt . Are you really smart enough to be shopping at Warby Parker ? Have you read even Warby Parker of the books displayed ? It ’s dispiriting in a way to see    chain stores feel as if they must contort themselves to stay vital in chain stores is becoming chain stores ever more polarized retail culture . A store like Cohen ’s never makes you feel like a loser . Maybe it should post that outside of every branch A store like Cohen’s and declare a social victory .
