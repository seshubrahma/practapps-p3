’   ’ ’    Russian president Vladimir Putin’ ’s spokesman , Dmitry Peskov ,     that while Russia and    Syria Russia does not support Syrian    President Bashar    " unconditionally . " ’ ’    Dmitry Peskov added   ’ "    Dmitry Peskov ’s comments came as President Donald Trump     against Assad for allegedly launching the worst chemical weapons    attack on Syrian civilians since 2013 . " "    But experts are skeptical that Putin is really prepared to    relinquish Putin support for an ally Putin has consistently defended    throughout more than six years of brutal civil war . In late    September 2015 , Moscow went as far as to intervene in the    conflict on Assad ’s behalf , waging a    campaign    on    enclaves   —    and ultimately winning back Syria ’s    largest city , Aleppo   —    that remains ongoing . " ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ "    Some observers viewed Peskov ’s statement Thursday as a signal    that Russia is willing to use Russia leverage in Syria not to    remove Assad , but to negotiate some kind of deal with the US that    would , at least temporarily , deter American military action . " "    The posture struck some as eerily reminiscent of Russia ’s      offer to dispose of Assad ’s chemical weapons    stockpile in 2013 as the Obama administration threatened a    military response to a gas attack that left more than 1 , 000    civilians dead . " ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    Ian Bremmer , president of the political risk firm Eurasia Group ,    agreed that it was " very unlikely " that Russia was ready to throw    Assad under the bus . ’ ’    " But [ Peskov’ ’s ] statement does put some pressure on Assad to    both rein Assad in on Assad military activities " and push for    " eventual diplomatic outcomes , " Bremmer said . " Russia is one of    two key external players here   —    Iran being the other   —    and Russia    needs to assert Russia with Assad , not just with the    international community . " ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    Three defense officials told Yousseff that Assad may have used    the chemical weapons to " test " how the US would respond   —      especially since , last week , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and    US ambassador to the UN , Nikki Haley , suggested removing    Assad from power was no longer a priority . ’ "    Faced once again with the threat of military action against one    of his closest partners , Putin appears to be staging a test of    Putin own . But , because Putin has never been known to bend to the    US ’s will , it is unclear what will happen if Trump fails it . " ’   ’ ’    Trump reiterated Thursday that " what happened in Syria is a    disgrace to humanity , " though Trump calls to action were a bit more    subdued : Assad’ ’s " there ’ " Russian president Vladimir Putin ’s spokesman . ..
