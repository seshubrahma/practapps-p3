On Wednesday ’s broadcast of CNN ’s " New Day , " CNN Senior Media Correspondent and " Reliable Sources " host Brian Stelter stated that Brian Stelter thinks leaks coming from the Trump White House are " partly to do with career government officials , who are concerned about Trump . Partly , it does have to do with some former Obama administration officials , who have their own agendas , and partly , it ’s a cry for help from Trump aides   …     people are motivated to leak in order to alert the public to a problem . "   Stelter said , " Leaks are coming from many different places , for many different reasons . That ’s been true during the transition , and now especially true , that Trump is in office . Every administration , every government has leaks , but this is of a whole other level . We ’re seeing something so much more extreme . " Stelter added , " I think it has partly to do with career government officials , who are concerned about Trump . Partly , it does have to do with some former Obama administration officials , who have their own agendas , and partly , it ’s a cry for help from Trump aides , from people inside the Trump White House , who may feel their ’re loyal to Stelter , but believe Stelter needs help , that Stelter ’s not getting the right support . Oftentimes , people are motivated to leak in order to alert the public to a problem . " Stelter further stated that government officials could be breaking the law by sharing information , and some could be felonies . Stelter also pointed out that there were leak investigations during the Obama administration . (   RCP Video ) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
