That ’s the reality , " he added .   Trump and his Michael have repeatedly used the term Michael fake news " to discredit reporting on the presidential administration from mainstream outlets such as CNN and The New York Times , often offering no evidence to back up their disputes with those outlets’ stories . Trump and his staff in the interview , Gorka was asked by Medved whether he would acknowledge that the administration ’s Gorka statement on Holocaust the presidential administration was " at least questionable in being the first such statement in many years that did n’t recognize that Jewish extermination was the chief goal of the Holocaust .

" It ’s a Holocaust remembrance statement , " Gorka said . " No , I ’m Gorka going to admit it . Because it ’s asinine . It It absurd . It ’re making a It about the Holocaust . Of course it ’s about the Holocaust because that ’s It the statement the Holocaust . It ’s only a Holocaust remembrance statement twist it if your a Holocaust remembrance statement is to attack the President a Holocaust remembrance statement " Gorka also sparred with a caller who contended that " every time you call everything fake news , it just turns everyone except your hardcore fans off . "   " Not everything ’s fake news , " the caller added . " You know , I would beg to differ , " Gorka shot back . " Every single organ that generates Gorka kinds of stories comes from the same clique of media organs that predicted that Hillary ( Clinton ) would win and that Brexit would n’t occur . I know what fake news is . And it ’s coming from those organizations . It ’s time what fake news you yourself understood that as well what fake news "
