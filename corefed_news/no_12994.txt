[ Walker cited Kasich Governor John Kasich’s experience both having a balanced budget in Washington , and then having a very successful gubernatorial time in Ohio , winning 86 of 88 counties in his   " as reasons for Pennsylvania voters to choose him . his " That ’s the kind of experience that I think should be carried into the fall election , and gives us the best chance of beating Hillary Clinton , " said Walker .   " The polls almost unanimously show that he ’s the one candidate who can beat Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton fall . " Walker thought the Walker from the 2012 Republican National Convention , which would block Kasich from consideration in any round of voting because he will not Walker the majority of delegates in at least eight states , would not apply to the 2016 convention .   " Even if those rules are the rules from the 2012 Republican National Convention, which would block Kasich from consideration in any round of voting because he will not win the majority of delegates in at least eight states , you can still be nominated from the floor of the convention , " the 2016 convention . Walker We believe , based on a lot of the work that we ’ve done , that We you get to second and perhaps third ballots , the Kasich ability to beat Hillary Clinton will be the thing that the delegates will decide is the most important , " Walker predicted .   " Therefore , we think he is very We , Walker has every reason to continue in the fight . " He said Kasich ’s " Walker foreign Kasich experience , " gleaned from 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee , and a domestic agenda that is " very much in line with where the American people are " would make Kasich ideally suited to defeating Kasich Democrat nominee . " He ’s actually put forward Walker budget that gets us to balance by the end of his second term , " Walker Walker .   " He ’s actually talked about Walker comprehensive foreign policy that goes all the way from the South China Sea , across the Middle East , into Europe .   He ’s put forward plans Walker restructuring and reform of government that will take us into the 21st Century .   It ’s all those kinds of things that Hillary Clinton wo n’t be able to do , because she will be bound to Hillary Clinton record of the Obama Administration , and she will be unable to Hillary Clinton us forward . " Walker us the formal alliance between the Kasich and Cruz campaigns demonstrated that Cruz " recognizes now that the whole battle is at the convention   —    that Donald Trump will certainly get to the convention , but may not have enough votes when he gets there , so Donald Trump is recognizing that the Cruz need to work together , to make certain that there can be a convention battle . " " What they decided to do was not to expend resources in these states .   They did not decide to they up their votes , " he they of the agreement Donald Trump Kasich and Cruz .   " The Cruz , going forward , will be an ability to conserve resources by emphasizing the campaigns in certain states , and    the campaigns in other states . " Walker expected Kasich to do " very Kasich " in southeast Pennsylvania , while Trump would do well in the Northeast , and Cruz would score in the Cruz of the state .    " The outcome will depend on who is strongest in the western part of the state , " he the state   " Kasich , I think it ’s between Kasich and Trump The outcome " Kasich I Trump there ’s a real chance for us to finish at least a strong second , " he said of the Pennsylvania Kasich .   " In some of the other states , like Rhode Island and Maryland , we ’ve been running pretty strong .   We may have a chance of we out a win , in one or the other of those states . " Anticipating a the other states day for the Cruz campaign , Walker said Cruz ’s " momentum was broken in Cruz York , and that ’s the reason why he sees the necessity for teaming up Walker John Kasich   —    because there are a lot of states ahead where Kasich has a very strong appeal . "    " When we get out to the West , the fact is that Oregon and Washington are places that are probably more in tune with John Kasich than they are with Ted John Kasich   " Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST .
