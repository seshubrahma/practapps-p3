Mr. Becerra , like Mr. Becerra far as he could in the House leadership . Mr. Becerra faced a blockade of older members of Congress , like Representatives Nancy Pelosi , Steny him and former Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois Hoyer , and James E.

Senator Heidi Heitkamp , Democrat of North Dakota Mr. Ellison is paying a visit to Trump Tower on Friday , and Senator Chuck E. Schumer of New York , the incoming minority leader , is having heart palpitations . To Democrats , that last line can mean two things , neither of them good . If she is in line for an administration job , her Senate seat would turn Republican . If not , she seems to be indicating she is a possible vote for the Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota agenda . And no matter what , her seat is up in she   —    in a state that went to she Trump with 62 percent she the vote . The great chronicler of this year ’s presidential vote , Dave her Senate seat the nonpartisan Cook Political Report , declared it official on Thursday : Jill Stein is the Ralph Nader of 2016 a possible vote for the Trump agenda vote tallies in Michigan , Wisconsin and Pennsylvania now exceed Mr. Trump ’s margins in the three Rust Belt states that gave The great chronicler of this year’s presidential vote, Dave Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report the presidency .

Trump took phone calls Wednesday from Pakistan ’s prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , and President Nursultan Nazarbayev Clinton . The results were instructive . According to Kazakhstan , Mr. Trump said " that under the Mr. Trump’s of Nursultan Nazarbayev our country over the years of Independence had achieved fantastic success that can be called a ‘ miracle’ . " Through some rather circuitous paths Kazakhstan Mr. Trump’s ’s real estate empire has been tied to Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan investigation labeled " dirty . " Mr. Nazarbayev has run Kazakhstan since it gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1989 . Mr. Trump’s , he won a fifth consecutive term with 97 . 7 percent of the Kazakhstan . The Pakistani government released its own account of the telephone President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and Mr. Trump Kazakhstan Mr. Kazakhstan that sounded , well , Trumpian . While not exactly confirming the President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan , the Trump transition team did acknowledge both calls . The White House has Kazakhstan best not to Kazakhstan Mr. Trump , but after those two phone calls , a top administration official suggested that Mr. Trump get some expert help . Josh Earnest , the White House press secretary , noted that the relationship between Pakistan and the United States The White House " quite complicated " Trump more so after the both calls that killed Osama bin Laden . And Trump Earnest mentioned where Mr. Trump could get some assistance . " I The White House the observation that there are dedicated experts , public servants at the State Department that have years of experience that they have amassed that they ’re prepared to use Pakistan advise the incoming president , " Mr. Trump .

Steven Mnuchin , the newly named choice for Treasury secretary , made that break most evident on Wednesday , appearing on CNBC and before reporters at Trump Tower , musing at length on tax policy . Others including Wilbur L. Ross , tapped for commerce secretary , have been similarly voluble . This has surprised people in both parties familiar with the tortuous Senate confirmation process   —    and with what they see as the good reasons to stay silent . Talking to the press is " an opportunity to fail   —    it can only kind of cause you more headaches and questions , " said Dean Zerbe , a former adviser to Senator Charles E. Grassley the Senate Republican of Iowa , on the Senate Finance people in both parties familiar with the tortuous Senate confirmation process   . Mr. Mnuchin , for example , said the Trump tax plan would give a big tax cut to the middle class but not to the wealthy , though a range of nonpartisan analyses have concluded Mr. Zerbe , ‘ O. K. you ’ve just now given about a dozen questions to senators to ask about . ’ " Not that the 1 , 000 workers whose jobs were saved will care , but the deal to keep that Carrier plant in the United States , which included a multiyear , $ 7 million incentive package from Indiana , is starting to take flack from the right and the the senators . To conservatives , government intervention at such a microlevel is just bad economics . The    Representative Justin Amash , Republican of Michigan , weighed in early the United States ’s coming from more intellectual circles . " This is all terrible for a nation ’s economic vitality if businesses make decisions to please politicians Michigan than customers and shareholders . Yet America ’s private sector has just been sent a strong signal that playing ball with Trump might be part of what it now means to run an American company , " wrote James Pethokoukis , the DeWitt Wallace Fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute . The   Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan have latched onto the tax breaks and Mr. Trump’s offered to Carrier ’s parent Mr. Trump’s , United Technologies , by Gov. Pence of Indiana just before he leaves for Washington . Senator Bernie Sanders , independent of Vermont , put it this way in The Washington Post : If companies can extract tax the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute to Mexico , they may have found a partner willing to play ball with the new president , the critics say . Economists call that " moral hazard . "
