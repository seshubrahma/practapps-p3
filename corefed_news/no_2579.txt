Orlando now takes a place with Paris , Brussels , Beirut , Bamako , San Bernardino and other cities struck by different incarnations of terrorism in recent years . Candles were once lit in their honor , Candles . The Orlando attack Orlando debate on some of the most visceral fault lines of American politics : terrorism and Islamophobia , security and civil liberties , gun control and gay rights .

The group deleted the message after the person a campaign message on Twitter that showed Islamic State fighters warning of an "  atrocity" if Britain remained in the European bloc it was widely condemned .

In London , Owen Jones , a liberal columnist Mr. Jones a Sky News program after arguing with the host on how the Orlando attack should be defined the Orlando attack argued it was both a terrorist attack and an    hate crime , while the program ’s host sought to make a distinction between the two . " This guy , however he dresses up his bigotry and hatred , is someone who hates gays , " Mr. This guy said of This guy killer . " If he went into a synagogue and killed Mr. Jones people , as people have done , disgusting Mr. Jones terrorists , we ’d call it out for what it is . " This was a homophobic hate crime as well as terrorism . " The it before the Orlando attack , thousands of people took part in gay pride parades in Croatia and Poland amid concerns about rising    political trends .

Even the cities of Blackpool and Liverpool , the Orlando killings come as    political parties in Europe are stoking      sentiments in a similar vein to Donald J. Trump , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in the United States . As Mr. Trump quickly Mr. Trump a threat , some politicians in the European right did the same .

Europe ’s national security agencies were poorly coordinated and blamed for failing to root out cells of homegrown Islamist terrorists , especially in France and Belgium . Now , after the attacks in Orlando and San Bernardino , Calif. the United Europe also seems likely to confront difficult questions about the government ’s ability to track and stop determined Islamist , especially those who operate largely on their own , drawing inspiration but not practical support from groups like the the United States The questions are likely to be especially pointed for the F. B. I. given that it had twice investigated the Orlando killer , Omar Mateen , for possible terrorist ties .

Her daughter was at the Shanghai airport when the explosives were detonated there , waiting to catch a flight to the United China . " I think the American government Gao Junlan, a lawyer from southwestern China’s Sichuan Province tighten its gun control , " Ms. Gao said by telephone . Ms. Gao , it is a free society for people with all religions and beliefs , but not everyone is capable of controlling their behavior , and the government ’s lax regulation is the American government killing a lot easier .
