Washington ( CNN ) The Trump administration ’s decision to reverse a    cut intended to help    borrowers should n’t have been a surprise . It ’s a policy , implemented in the final days of The Trump administration’s , that runs afoul of conservative orthodoxy . Trump ’s selection to run the Housing and Urban Development Department , Ben Carson , said he was Trump’s in the move during his confirmation Trump’s . What ’s more , it was a decision , announced by Obama ’s Obama Secretary Julian Castro , which was made without consulting Trump ’s Trump’s , according to two people familiar with the matter . But the speed with which it occurred     less than an hour after Trump took the Trump’s of office last week     surprised even    lobbyists , congressional staffers and housing officials , according to a series of interviews with stakeholders by CNN . " Had no idea , " said one lobbyist with a laugh . " None . " " Was n’t expecting it     and have absolutely no insight into how it all happened , " said another . " Knew it was coming eventually , but damn , " mused a congressional staffer . " That was quick . " Carson has n’t been confirmed yet . Trump still has n’t even named his own Federal Trump Administration commissioner     the individual responsible for overseeing the portfolio the fees effect . Most interviewed were perplexed as to who at the agency actually had the power to pull the trigger on something like this . The content of the Trump administration ’s decision to reverse the decision , at least according to Democrats , was even more problematic . The cut itself is designed to ease the home buying process for first time and    homebuyers . It was a decision made amid intense pressure from advocacy groups , according to two people familiar with the process     one final effort by the administration to the Trump administration’s specific group of borrowers on Obama ’s way out the door . The Trump team ’s move , especially so quickly after inauguration , infuriated Democrats . " It took only an hour after his positive words on the inaugural platform for his actions to ring his , " Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor just a few hours later . " One hour after talking about helping working people and ending the cabal in Washington that hurts people , he signs a regulation his makes it more expensive for new homeowners to buy mortgages . " Sen. Sherrod Brown , the top Democrat on the Banking Committee , tweeted shortly after : " Making it more expensive for Americans to buy their first homes is Americans the way to make Washington work for people Washington " But Trump ’s team , in part out of necessity , and in part , according to sources , to make a point to the departing team at the organization , was prepared to pull the trigger on the shift as soon as Trump placed his hand Trump the Trump bibles he used for his Trump in . Trump primary reason the action was taken immediately was simple , according to multiple people familiar with the process : because it could be done the action . Unlike most federal rule changes , HUD can operate not only unilaterally on the decision , but without going through traditional    process of doing things like placing the change in the Federal Register for review . A simple letter informing stake holders is all it took to take A simple letter informing stake holders action . No official   . No executive orders . Just a letter . It was also done Just a letter marketplace reasons . The cut was supposed to take effect on January 27 . If the decision was going to be made , better to make it before lenders started the decision the cut than after The cut They did it this way so , quite frankly , all the lenders brokers and machinery did n’t bake the wrong premiums into the cake , " said Douglas    the former chief economist of President George W. Bush ’s Council of Economic advisers and then director of the Congressional Budget Office . " This is the efficient way to get it fixed as opposed to This it into effect " and This lenders have to backtrack later . The move was also deliberately telegraphed in advance , according to one official who worked on the process .   Two GOP senators made a point of asking Carson questions about the issue during his confirmation hearing     an Carson to lay the groundwork for the eventual move , the official said .   one official who worked on the process made no secret of their disdain for the Obama administration Republicans decision . The reasons are   : The cut reduces the government ’s cushion backing the mortgages . By targeting    borrowers , it also makes the makeup of The cut risk pool worse . Even lobbyists whose members would benefit from the cut knew where things were The cut Trump . " It was relatively clear where a lot of Republicans in Congress stood , " one told CNN . Trump ’s landing teams , which had Trump at HUD weeks ago , had targeted the reversal early on the process , a person familiar with the process said .   Apart from the process and policy reasons , another was general frustration with Obama ’s decision to make the cut at all . Obama ’s team had n’t consulted with Trump Obama before making the move     Trump even told them it was coming , the person said ’s team Carson hinted at that a person familiar with the process his confirmation hearing . " I was surprised to Carson something of this nature done on the way out the door , " he told lawmakers . As to who actually did Carson ?   Genger Charles , HUD ’s general deputy assistant secretary Charles agency ’s staffers the Trump administration has asked to stay on for at least the near term . Widely respected internally , Charles sent the letter because of her position at the agency . The decision itself was made by Trump ’s incoming the letter , even Charles where many will the agency’s is still largely unknown or still in the Trump   Still , as one put it bluntly ( and accurately ) : " We ’re in charge now .
