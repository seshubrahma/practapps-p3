Sunday on CBS ’s " Face the Nation , " Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus said President Donald Trump did not have an " understanding " of the role of courts " and added that President Donald Trump did n’t " understand the role of America . "   Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus said , " I think there there is a lot of fallout here . Mike talked about how you ca n’t run the government by improv , and Vice President Pence talked about Washington niceties . These are n’t just Washington niceties , These are questions about whether you can run the government . And there is lasting damage here in his relationships with congress , in his his with the country , which saw these terrible stories of people needing medical treatment being denied , in the relationship with his his , in his his with the world . " " And a more fundamentally , the lesson of the week to me is that we have a president who fundamentally is not understanding the role of courts , this tweet about    judges was not just , you know , something that we should ignore , and he    n’t understand the role of America as it the role of America historically been in the the world a beacon of hope and welcoming place for refugees , " she added .
