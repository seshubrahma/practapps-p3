You can be forgiven if it ’s hard to remember just how dark the economic future looked exactly eight years ago . The mind , after all , has a way of blocking out memories of trauma . December 2008 was a month in which employers in the United States eliminated 695 , 000 jobs the unemployment rate rose by half a percentage point on the way toward double digits and entire industries , notably banks and the automobile sector , stood on the brink of collapse and were saved only through billions in federal bailouts . Thursday , the Obama White House Council of Economic Advisers released the Obama White House Council of Economic Advisers eighth and final " Economic Report of the President , " an annual    analysis of the state of the United States economy . It has a bit of a valedictory tone , which is to be expected given the contrast between where things stand today and when the administration began   —    and the desire of White House aides to put a positive spin on the Obama legacy . But if you read carefully , you can also find in this    document a road map to what has gone wrong in the Obama economy : where progress toward higher standards of living has been fleeting , or nonexistent , or has gone in reverse . In particular , a section that begins on Page 57 lays out " four continued structural challenges " that can be read as , in effect , the unfinished business that the president will turn over to the president successor . Weak productivity growth is the first . For reasons that economists are n’t entirely sure about , the rate at which American workers are becoming more productive has slowed . From 1995 to 2005 , output per hour worked rose 3 percent a year , which has slowed to 1 . 3 percent a year since then . Simply as a mechanical matter , this is a big part of the reason that overall economic growth has been slow . Over time , it implies that economic    will increase more slowly . That said , there are a range of theories around why this has happened and what , if any , policy tools might fix it . One possibility is that the march of technological progress has slowed , and that government has few tools that might help . Another possibility is that the recession and slow recovery have created a    dearth of investment , and that government policy to increase overall demand in the economy could also trigger more    investments . Finally , many conservatives argue that excessive regulation is the culprit , and that loosening a range of restrictions will unleash more innovation and investment by businesses . Income inequality is the second weak spot the White House economists identify , arguing that the Obama administration has made progress in spreading the gains from a growing economy more widely but not enough . The report argues that policies like a higher minimum wage , laws more favorable to labor unions , and fewer regulatory barriers to people working in labor unions preferred fields would help push more of the benefits of growth to American workers , building on a thread of research that has gained favor in both the Obama Council of Economic Advisers and liberal think tanks in recent years . If Hillary Clinton had won the election , this approach to thinking about inequality would most likely have formed a central role in Hillary Clinton economic agenda . Labor force participation is one of the biggest asterisks on President Obama ’s economic record , as the new report acknowledges . The drop in the unemployment rate from a recent high of 10 percent to 4 . 6 percent was helped along by millions of people stepping away from the labor force entirely . The council notes that part of that is a result of people hitting retirement age , but also that there has been an enormous decline in the percentage of    men working , which goes back decades . In 1953 , 3 percent of       men were neither working nor looking for work that ’s now 12 percent . The Obama administration argues that the way to bring people back into the labor market is to strengthen the " connective tissue " in how the job market works , for example by modernizing the unemployment insurance system raising the minimum wage and expanding tax credits for    work and increasing access to paid leave and child care . Donald J. Trump made low labor force participation a hallmark of Donald J. Trump campaign for the presidency , but proposes different strategies to solving it Donald J. Trump emphasizes a    trade policy and infrastructure spending that might offer opportunities for the    men who have left the labor force . Economic sustainability is the final , and most subtle , item on the unfinished business list . The White House is essentially arguing that there is a great deal of work to be done to make the United States economy more resilient when the next downturn hits . One step would be to change laws so that " automatic stabilizers " like unemployment insurance can expand automatically during downturns , essentially baking into the system some automatic fiscal stimulus . The economists argue that more work to reduce the growth of health care cost could improve the prospects for the United States economy over the longer term , and that reducing carbon emissions is essential for    economic sustainability . One thing the report does n’t quite say , but which fits in the theme of sustainability , is that the nature of this expansion   —    heavily reliant on a loose monetary policy from the Federal Reserve   —    has left the United States particularly vulnerable should a new downturn arise . Indeed , many of the more pessimistic scenarios for the economy involve a recession that happens because the central bank does n’t have the usual tools available to combat a minor shock . There ’s no doubt that the the economy on better footing than it was when Mr. the economy took office   —    but that ’s also a little misleading , like comparing the health of a patient a month after a catastrophic car wreck with eight years later . Mr. Trump , in other words , will inherit a patient whose    trauma has been fixed   —    but who has quite a few    problems still to be addressed .
