’   ’ ’    Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson mostly dodged a question from    Sen. Elizabeth Warren during Sen. Elizabeth Warren Thursday confirmation hearing    for secretary of housing and urban development , making an    unfortunate gaffe along the way . ’ ’    Warren , the Massachusetts Democrat , asked Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson for a " simple    yes or no " on whether he’’d be able to ensure the Department of    Housing and Urban Development’ ’s grants and loans did not    financially benefit    Donald Trump’ ’s businesses . ’ ’    " If you are confirmed to lead HUD , you will be responsible for    issuing billions of dollars in grants and loans to help develop    housing and provide a lot of    services , " she said .    " Now , housing development is an area in which      Trump and     Trump family have significant business interests . Can you    assure me that not a single taxpayer dollar that you give out    will financially benefit the    or his family ? " ’ ’    Carson said he Carson " absolutely not play favors for anyone "    because he Carson " driven by a sense of morals and values . " ’ ’    Warren pressed on . ’ ’    " Can you just assure us that not one dollar will go to benefit    either the    or his family ? " she said . ’ ’    " It will not be my intention to do anything to benefit any    American , " Carson said . He Carson realized the gaffe and fixed    the answer in his Carson statement , " It’ ’s for all Americans ,       that we do . " ’ ’    " I will manage things in a way that benefits the American    people , " he Carson clarified . " That is going to be the goal . " ’ ’    But Carson still would not provide a yes or no . ’ ’   ’ ’    " If there happens to be an extraordinarily good program that is    working for millions of people and it turns out that someone that    you’’re targeting is going to gain $ 10 from it    am I going to say ,    ’’ No , the rest of you Americans can’’t have it    ? " he   ’’ . " I think    logic and common sense probably would be the best way . " ’ ’    Warren said that the issue was not assurances of the " $ 10    varieties , but of    varieties . " ’ ’    " The reason you can’’t assure us of that is because the      is hiding his the      ’s business interests from    you , from me Warren from the rest of America , " she said . " And this just    highlights the absurdity and the danger of the   ’ ’s       to put his    in a true blind trust . " ’ ’    Warren said Trump is able to " divert taxpayer money into his Trump    pockets without anyone knowing , " adding that his Trump       that he Trump transfer his Trump to his Trump eldest    sons was meaningless . ’ ’    A Trump Trump   for Trump Trump separate    himself from his himself , which included relinquishing    leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his himself    sons , Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump , in addition to another    longtime organization employee . ’ "    Ethics experts voiced their Ethics experts of that plan , however ,    which was unveiled during Trump ’s Wednesday press conference at    Trump Tower . " ’    " Tragically , the Trump Trump to deal with his Trump conflicts    announced today falls short in every respect , " Norman Eisen ,       special counsel for ethics and government reform in       Barack Obama’ ’s administration , according to The New    Yorker’ ’s Ryan Lizza . ’ ’ ’ ’Sen . Warren to Dr. Carson : " You can’’t assure us that HUD money . .. will not end up in the   ’ ’s pockets " ’
