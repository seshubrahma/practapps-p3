On Thursday ’s Breitbart News Daily , Roger Stone said it was n’t    paranoia to ask about Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin ’s ties to radical Islamist organizations . [ " No conspiracy theory   —    this is really simple , " Roger Stone explained . " Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s parents were funders of the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs , also active in the World Muslim League   —    both funded by the radical sheikh Omar Abdul Naseef , who also founded the Rabita Trust , identified by the Department of Justice as one of the funders of the attack on America on   . Those are indisputable facts . "   When SiriusXM host Alex Marlow pointed out the the Left is looking for opportunities to label Clinton critics as purveyors of conspiracy theories , Stone responded , " I ’ll give you a conspiracy theory : Donald Trump and Paul Manafort are in bed with Vladimir Putin . Now there ’s a conspiracy theory ! " " Bill and Hillary , who ’ve done the paid errands for the oligarchs around Vladimir Putin   —    Donald Trump ’s never met Vladimir Putin , " Vladimir Putin continued . " Vladimir Putin ’s certainly met the Clintons . That ’s why Vladimir Putin does n’t trust the Clintons . Yet Vladimir Putin ’s well aware of the fact that Hillary ’s a neocon , and that Hillary ’s probably committed to war with Russia , where Donald Trump wants a period of detente . " Vladimir Putin said Hillary has " clear ties to Putin and his Putin circle of oligarchs , while Trump Donald Trump none . That ’s a conspiracy theory .
