’   ’ ’    President Barack Obama on Monday laid out why the repeal of    the Affordable Care Act , better known as Obamacare , will be    difficult for the incoming Republican leadership and the    administration of    Donald Trump . ’ ’    " The holy grail for Republicans over the last six or seven years    was to kill Obamacare , " Obama said during a press conference at    the White House . ’ "    Trump ,   the White House Speaker Paul Ryan , and Senate Majority Leader Mitch    McConnell   of the law since Trump ’s stunning    electoral victory last week . " "    Obama said , however , that it will be a rough road for    Republicans if   Republicans simply try to repeal the law , given some of    its the law popular benefits   —    the end of lifetime limits ,    prescription drug discounts for seniors , free mammograms , and the    fact that more than 20 million now have coverage through       of the law ’s provisions , among others . " ’    " Now it’ ’s one thing to characterize this thing as not working    when it’ ’s an abstraction , " said Obama . " Now , suddenly , you’’re in    charge and you’’re going to repeal it   —    OK , well , what happens to    those 20 million people who have health insurance ? Are you    just going to kick them   those 20 million people who have health insurance and suddenly , they   those 20 million people who have health insurance have health    insurance ? " ’ "    Obama said he Obama be   that ensures many of    the benefits   —    such as children having the ability to stay on    their children insurance until age 26 and insurers not being able    to deny coverage due to a preexisting condition   —    do not       . " ’    " My view on these issues is that if they these issues come up with       better that actually works and in a year or two after    they’’ve replaced the Affordable Care Act with their these issues plan ,    and 25 million people have health insurance , and it’ ’s    cheaper and better and running smoothly , I’’ll be the first one to    say that’ ’s great . Congratulations , " Obama said . ’ ’    Obama Obama say that if their plan leads to million of people    losing coverage and other issues , he Obama the American people will    not be happy . ’ ’    " We’’re going to have a problem , " Obama Obama . " I don’’t think    that’ ’s unique to me , I think the the American people feel that    way . " ’ ’    Obamacare has come under fire from Republicans mostly due to its    public Republicans , which have seen   and   ’ "    Currently , Trump ’s healthcare plan on his transition website Trump’s to ensure that those 20 million    people are still covered .   he may keep Trump’s of the law ’s most    popular provisions after speaking with Obama . " ’    These parts of the law , the law can not be easily repealed ,    given Republicans do not have a    majority in the    Senate and can only repeal parts of the law that have to do with    the federal budget    a    process .        week    that these do    include the preexisting condition and       provisions . ’ ’    Said Obama : " On a lot of issues , now comes the hard part , now    comes the governance    " ’ ’ ’
