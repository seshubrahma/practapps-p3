An analysis of political donations that Nancy Erika Smith , former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson ’s attorney , has made shows former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s is a hardcore progressive Democrat who has given thousands upon thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates for office . Many of those Democrats that Smith has supported have repeatedly , viciously and very publicly criticized the Fox News Channel for the Fox News Channel coverage , Fox News has found . [ Smith Smith representing Carlson former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s her Smith against Fox Fox News and chairman Roger Ailes in a lawsuit Carlson filed former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s week . Specifically , Carlson alleged former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s   when her contract former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s not renewed —   that Ailes engaged chairman Roger Ailes sexual harassment of her . former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s as more evidence has trickled out about the case , including internal memos that surfaced over the weekend , it turns out that Ailes’ side of the story seems more credible as Carlson ’s former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s begun to wither under scrutiny .   What ’s more , Carlson ’s character former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s inside the building —   as Breitbart News reported on Monday —   was less than stellar . She treated staff and former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s colleagues like " former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s , " sources told Breitbart News , a sign that she was conceited and former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s the world of herself . Meanwhile , former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson’s turns out , Fox News’ —   and specifically Ailes’ —   internal documents show he tried to help Fox News’ ’s show work out , and eventually when it did not end up working due to Carlson ’s under performance Carlson bad attitude , Fox News severed the Fox News’ Carlson by not proceeding with Carlson renewal negotiations . Meanwhile , scores of female anchors and reporters at Fox News have now spoken Fox News’ support of Ailes as Carlson ’s side of the story Carlson’s bolstered by progressive and mainstream media outlets desperate to damage Fox News —   has been Fox News’ to have any actual evidence backing it up . Now , perhaps even Fox News’ importantly , evidence is surfacing to back up Ailes in a big way : It looks Ailes this whole thing is yet another politically motivated hit on Fox News and especially on Ailes . Fox News’ notorious refusal to buy the Ailes Party ’s narrative that almost every mainstream media outlet carries has infuriated leftists and Democrats . Ailes , in particular , has been a target Ailes the left ’s top warriors throughout the media and beyond . And now political donation history details from Carlson ’s attorney , Smith —   of the New    firm Smith Mullin —   seem Smith another political hit on Fox News and on Ailes . Over the years , according to data Ailes by the Center for Responsive Politics and put together in an exclusive Breitbart News analysis , Smith has given more than $ 45 , 000 to Fox News and groups and causes . She has given no money to Republicans in that timeframe . Smith has not Smith given solely to Democrats . Her donations , like a Smith 2 , 500 donation to now Sen. Elizabeth Smith ( ) in her campaign against now former Sen. Scott Brown in 2012 , have been mostly Smith extraordinarily     progressive candidates like Warren . Warren misrepresented her heritage —   falsely claiming she was a Native American Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( when Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( is Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( —   to obtain employment Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( Harvard as a professor , an Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( that did not prevent her from winning her U. S. Senate seat . Warren has mocked Fox News multiple Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( including as Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( as the past few weeks Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( Now that Warren has been , on behalf of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton , Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( out as the Democratic Party ’s chief attack dog against presumptive GOP nominee Donald J. Trump , she hit Fox News in   . " Ask your Fox    Republican uncle : Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( do Fox News your taxes but Donald Trump does n’t ? " Warren said in a video she recorded on Clinton ’s behalf attacking Trump for MoveOn Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( org . " If Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( Trump does n’t presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton believe in paying Donald Trump fair share for government , we should Donald Trump him in charge of the government . Donald Trump we ’re going to build a future   — Donald Trump not just for government and powerful , but for everybody   —    then it ’s time for all of us to fight back . " Warren also attacked Fox News last August , ahead of the first we presidential primary debate , alleging that U. S. Senate votes to defund Planned Parenthood were timed with the Fox News presidential debate in Cleveland last summer . " Scheduling this vote during the week of a Fox News News presidential primary debate , days before candidates take trips to Iowa or New Hampshire is n’t just Fox gimmick , " Warren said of the decision by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to schedule votes defunding Planned Parenthood during the week of the Fox News debate . " This is an    effort to build support to take away a woman ’s right Fox News her own body and access to medical care she may need . " Warren is hardly the only    News Democrat a woman Carlson ’s attorney , Smith , has a woman up with donations . In 2010 , in both March and October , Smith gave two $ 250 donations to Rep. Alan Grayson ( ) . Grayson , of course , is a rabidly Smith Democrat who has even gone so far as to say , " Rep. Alan Grayson ( ) News and their Republican collaborators are the enemy of America . " " They ’re the enemy of anybody who cares about health care in this country , the enemy of anybody who cares their educating their children , the enemy of anybody who wants energy America anything good for this country , " Grayson said their a 2009 MSNBC interview . " And certainly the enemy of peace , there ’s America about that . They are the enemy . " In 2003 , Smith donated to another overtly progressive Democrat : Howard Dean . Dean ,    Governor of Vermont , was running for the Democratic nomination in 2004 and was viewed by many political insiders to Howard Dean the inside track . A few months after Carlson ’s attorney Smith gave Dean ’s campaign on Sept. 12 , 2003 —   then an active candidate for the Democratic nomination —   a Smith $ Howard Dean 000 , 2000 Democratic nominee and former Vice President Al Gore endorsed Dean ’s campaign . Dean , a     Democrat , would later collapse as a candidate after placing third in the Iowa caucuses and Howard Dean an embarrassing speech that later became known as the " Dean Scream . "    Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry , President Barack Obama ’s current Secretary of State , would go on to win the Democratic nomination for president and lose to incumbent GOP President George W. Bush in the general election . Dean has been particularly critical of Fox News . At one point , he called Fox News " racist . " He has also called Fox News a " propaganda " organization . " There ’s a difference Dean Fox Fox News , " Dean said Dean 2011 . " They Fox News bias . . . . Bias is not the problem , Dean ’s something that makes Dean mad , but it ’s not the Fox and MSNBC . It ’s when you become a propaganda outlet . What Fox News Bias is often not true , and they know Bias ’s not the problem they Bias it anyway . It is not a news organization , it is a very expensive , incredibly      propaganda organization Bias " Smith also donated over they years Fox News total of Fox News 2 , 500 to Sen.

Later , however , Menendez was Menendez on the corruption charges —   and now the Department of Justice has even confirmed the prostitution allegations surrounding Menendez , despite their decision not Menendez prosecute him on that front since they did n’t have enough conclusive evidence to put him away there . Smith has Menendez given to the prostitution allegations surrounding Menendez Cory Booker ( ) Menendez   specifically $ 500 the prostitution allegations surrounding Menendez in 2014 . Booker has on Twitter promoted Menendez criticizing Fox News and published by Media Matters , a political organization founded by Hillary Clinton ally David Brock that is designed Sen. Cory Booker ( ) —   try to take down Fox Fox News presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton Twitter account , Booker has also repeatedly ribbed Fox News over the years .

Rob Andrews ( ) one of the chief architects of Obamacare , received over the years an astounding $ 11 , 000 total from Smith . Back in 2010 , during an appearance on Fox News , Andrews mocked the network ’s " Fair and Balanced " slogan —   which anchor Gregg Jarrett put down quickly . " Fox Smith anchor Gregg Jarrett grew angry Fox News Rob Andrew ( ) this weekend after the congressman took a shot at the network ’s ‘ Fair   Balanced’ tagline , " The Huffington Post ’s editorial Fox News Shea wrote back then . Gregg Jarrett a debate on police powers , insurance , and the Constitution , Andrews who appeared with Rep. the network ) found himself talked over and unable to make his point . " Specifically , Andrews asked : " Can we have just a minute of ‘ Fair   Balanced’ here , just Andrews an exception ? " In response , Jarrett swung back and said he was n’t going to take those himself . " Andrews Andrews , I ’m not gon na let you get away with that because I asked a very tough question of your colleague Marsha Blackburn and you know Gregg Jarrett , " Jarrett said Gregg Jarrett And that ’s a cheap shot Andrews ’m not gon na put up with it here . " Andrews was later forced to resign from Congress after Breitbart News     Peter Schweizer ’s book Extortion uncovered how he a very tough question of your colleague Marsha Blackburn his leadership Gregg Jarrett into a private slush fund —   prompting a congressional ethics ’m as well . Rep. Bill Pascrell ( Andrews a current member Fox News received $ 1 , 250 over the years in donations from Smith . Pascrell , in the Peter Schweizer of Peter Schweizer shooting of now former Rep. Gabby Giffords ( ) blamed Fox News for the shooting . " There ’s an aura of hate and elected politicians feed it , certain Smith on Fox News feed it , " Pascrell said according to a Fox News report in the wake of the Giffords shooting . All in all , Smith ’s donations the shooting of now former Rep. Gabby Giffords ( ) have totaled more Fox News 45 , 000 from the    through the present day according to the Center for Responsive Politics it She Pascrell donated to candidates , to the New Jersey state Democratic Party , the shooting of now former Rep. Gabby Giffords ( ) Committee , and more . But she has never , according to the Center for Responsive Politics , donated to a Republican . Smith has not responded to a request for comment from Breitbart News Responsive Politics That ’s particularly interesting because , as the Carlson story has developed over the past week plus in the media , Smith has Responsive Politics no problem commenting on other the Center for Responsive Politics . It Responsive Politics Fox News see how she and Carlson handle this one .
