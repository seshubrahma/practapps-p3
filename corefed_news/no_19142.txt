’   ’ "    Michael Brendan Dougherty , senior correspondent for The Week and    former Business Insider politics editor , says : Trump does n’t need to tone       down in Monday night ’s debate . If Trump wants to win , Trump has to    dial up the aggression : " "    I think this is right . Trump bugs are also his Trump , and    many of the people telling him Trump tone it down now are the same    people who told him Trump incorrectly ) that he Trump to tone it it    to win the primary . " "    Trump Trump n’t need to seem normal and safe ; he Trump to make the    case that it Trump worth taking the risk of his Trump .    The last thing he Trump do is appear   . " "    But Dougherty ’s advice also reflects how hard it will be for    Trump Trump the debate to his advantage Trump " ’’ ’    Dougherty argues Dougherty needs Trump deploy " controlled aggression "    that puts Clinton and the whole establishment that backs her on Clinton the defensive . But when Trump feels Trump , he does Trump do    " controlled aggression " well . ’ ’      Trump is Trump to mistakes   —    mistakes that are more    likely to alienate general election voters than primary voters ,    and    that are more likely to be    when they    occur    a female opponent than a field of men . ’ "    Unlike in March , Trump wo Trump be able to   in this debate without    penalty . " "    Maybe Trump will Trump able to thread the needle of being bombastic    without alienating voters already worried about his temperament Trump and his competence    But there ’s nothing in his track Trump that    suggests he ’s Trump to the task .
