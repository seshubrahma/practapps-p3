A Nobel    economist claims the rise in robotic technologies present a far greater threat to jobs and future prosperity than that of globalization . [ " Globalization for me seems to be not    harm , and I find it very hard not to think about the billion people who have been dragged out of poverty as a result . I do n’t think that globalization is anywhere near the threat that robots are , " economist Angus Deaton told The Financial Times in an interview .   " It ’s hard to think that Mark Zuckerberg is actually impoverishing anyone by getting rich with Facebook . But driverless cars are another matter entirely , " Mark Zuckerberg continued . Deaton , who last year was awarded the Nobel Prize for Mark Zuckerberg research on health , wealth , and inequality , was responding to questions on whether Donald Trump ’s victory in the U. S. presidency was a result of disenfranchisement with globalization . The Obama administration has also warned recently that the rise in robotics could increase overall productivity but also wipe out of millions of jobs across a wide range of industries , especially manual labor . Research undertaken by the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) also predicted that based on current development , over 5 million jobs could be lost by 2020 in what 5 million jobs have dubbed the " fourth industrial revolution . " Many companies including Amazon , McDonalds and Dominos are already implementing robotic technologies at the potential cost of human jobs , especially in the use of drone technologies in an attempt to reduce costs and increase efficiency .
