  ( CNN ) Interviewed Monday on Fox News Channel ’s " Fox and Friends , " Donald Trump , the Republican presidential nominee , declared that Americans have traveled overseas , fought for ISIS and returned with impunity .    " Americans have traveled overseas, fought for ISIS and returned with impunity have people going over , fighting for ISIS and coming back , and Americans have traveled overseas, fought for ISIS and returned with impunity know people are fighting for ISIS , and Americans have traveled overseas, fought for ISIS and returned with impunity take people , " Fox News Channel’s "Fox and Friends said . " Once you leave this country , you fight for ISIS , you never come back . "    Is that really true that people come back and let loose ? In a word    no .    New America , a    think tank , has used public records and news accounts to track Americans who have aided ISIS . According to its analysis , 117 people in the US have attempted to join ISIS or other terrorist groups in Syria , have made it there to fight , or have helped other join these organizations . According to New America ’s report , 74 of those were arrested before reaching Syria .    managed to reach Syria and join the fight . Of those , 17 were killed and 8 were arrested when they those home .     " Any American who has traveled to fight with a designated foreign terrorist organization and returned here would be subject to prosecution , " said Justice Department spokesman , Marc Ramondi .    One person , Moner Abusalha of Florida , did train with the    affiliated group , the    Front , and did return undetected to the US . But rather than stage any attacks on US soil , Abusalha returned to Syria after unsuccessfully trying to recruit more fighters here . He Abusalha later killed .    There is no evidence for Trump ’s claim that US officials have allowed Americans who fought with terrorist groups in Syria Syria escape punishment when they Americans who fought with terrorist groups in Syria home .
