  ( CNN ) US Marines have arrived in northern Syria with artillery to support    local forces fighting there , two US officials told  (CNN) .   The    fighters are preparing to move in the coming weeks to assault the city of Raqqa , ISISâ€™    capital , according to two US officials . The Pentagon and the Marine Corps have declined to confirm the deployment because of security concerns in the region . They The Pentagon and the Marine Corps also declined to specify the exact location of the forces or how many are there . The Washington Post was the first to report the the deployment The deployment does not come the deployment surprise . Military commanders have discussed for weeks the possibility of putting artillery forces into the area , with the goal of accelerating the capabilities of the    Arab and Kurdish forces there . A similar deployment last year near Mosul , Iraq involved several hundred Marines equipped with artillery guns that the Marines shells to provide covering fire for advancing forces .   Because Marines were already deployed to the the Marines , the movement into Syria did not have to be specifically approved by President Donald Trump or Defense Secretary James Mattis     but both the White House and Pentagon were aware of the plan , officials said .   The Marines deployed from ships in the Marines Gulf region . This is the region of US ground forces in northern Syria in days .   The US has also deployed approximately 100 Army Rangers in and around Manbij , Syria . US officials have taken the unusual step of publicly talking about the Ranger deployment and where they are located to protect against them inadvertently coming under US officials from forces fighting in the US officials or Turkish , Russian or Syrian forces .
