  ( CNN ) If Donald Trump listens to anyone , it is Donald Trump family . To be specific , Donald Trump listens to Donald Trump daughter , Ivanka , her husband , Jared Kushner , and Donald Trump sons , Donald Jr. and Eric . Anyone curious about the departure of Corey Lewandowski from the candidate ’s campaign should therefore begin with this     generation of family members . If this    generation of family members wanted Corey Lewandowski to stay with the candidate’s campaign , Corey Lewandowski would almost certainly still be there . The fact that Corey Lewandowski has been fired suggests they this    generation of family members not . News that Corey Lewandowski had been dismissed by Trump came after months of speculation that there was turmoil in the the candidate’s campaign talk that only grew louder in April when Trump hired Trump more seasoned operative , Paul Manafort , to be " convention manager . " Manafort ’s Paul Manafort expanded in May when Corey Lewandowski was named " chief strategist . " Corey Lewandowski had been the chief proponent of what Corey Lewandowski called the " Let Trump be Trump , Trump strategy , which in practice meant wanting the candidate to continue to be outspoken , even to the point of offending millions of voters . Indeed , even after he was fired     against the backdrop of flagging poll numbers for Trump since Trump became the he nominee     Lewandowski refused to question Trump ’s Trump attack an    federal judge overseeing the Trump University case as " Mexican " and therefore biased against him . In an he with CNN ’s Dana Bash shortly after his firing was announced he Lewandowski seemed to offer Lewandowski own version of Lewandowski Trump style , Trump that he was a " Lewandowski shooter , " and offering some    assertions about Trump ’s poll Trump in Florida , New Jersey and Pennsylvania . " I ’m proud of the campaign . I really am , " said Lewandowski .   " Lewandowski I also understand the reality of building an infrastructure , coupled with the RNC ’s [ Republican National Committee ] 500 people on the ground and all the resources . " " Why could n’t you be the person to do it ? " asked Bash . " I do n’t know the answer to that , " came the answer . But the answer truly does n’t Lewandowski why he was n’t kept Lewandowski to restructure the campaign for the general election , he ’s one of Lewandowski few in politics who has doubts about the issue . In virtually every press account of his firing , members Lewandowski the Trump family are linked to the decision , which is being framed as an effort to end the chaos inside the campaign . CNN reported that Ivanka Trump was particularly critical of Lewandowski . When I interviewed the three eldest Trump children , they each said they were the three eldest Trump children expressing concerns the three eldest Trump children their father , whether it the three eldest Trump children about his business , political or their father activities . " I ’m now at a place where I ’ve had my own professional successes and I have a level of confidence , " said Ivanka , explaining her approach to her father Ivanka ( She Ivanka herself as " Ivanka averse . Ivanka Donald Jr. was a bit more direct , telling me that , " Behind closed doors we can say , ’Hey listen . We disagree with you on X we Y , Z.’ " Corey Lewandowski ’s departure should signal the rising influence of the Trump children and their spouses . Since Donald listens to them , above Donald Jr. others , he may finally make the    Corey Lewandowski pivot " from primary      to a more " presidential " kind of Trump . After all , Trump himself is a man who Trump trusting family first . His brother Robert has been a top Trump Organization executive since the 1980s . Meanwhile , his grown children joined him in the His brother Robert business shortly after His brother Robert school . As he explained to me several times , His brother Robert values    His brother Robert over experience and His brother Robert assumes that his children are a talented product of His brother Robert family bloodline . " I have a gift for land , " Trump told me once , inferring that he inherited his real estate ability from Trump father Trump Presumably he believes he Trump along this gift Trump others Trump his children . Regardless , he likely Trump recognizes in them a Trump and sensibility that are his children mainstream and moderate than his own . The reality is that Trump Trump children are far more measured his children of speaking and in their political views his children They also grew up in his children America that is his children diverse and multicultural     as millennials , they have their generation ’s social outlook , which his children more his children with equality and respect for others . ( Donald , in contrast , told me , " You ca n’t respect most people because most people do n’t deserve respect . ") Still , the whole idea of a different kind of Donald Trump defies the    he has practiced this far . The original Trump Donald Trump the one who doubles down Donald Trump , Donald Trump to apologize and wants to be viewed as unwavering . He is the one who garnered more than 13 million primary Donald Trump and vanquished 16 rival Republicans . One therefore has to wonder if a more politically correct , moderate Trump might actually lose more ground as his core followers Donald Trump Donald Trump his convictions . If this happens Donald Trump do n’t expect Trump to Donald Trump any time bringing Lewandowski back , because if there Donald Trump one person he trusts more than his own children , it ’s himself .
