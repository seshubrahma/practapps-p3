Breitbart News National Security editor Dr. Sebastian Gorka , author of the    book Defeating Jihad : The Winnable War , joined SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday ’s Breitbart News Daily to talk about the final act of the secretary of state drama , beginning with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ’s idea of working with former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton as a " dynamic duo " at the State Department . [ Dr. Gorka said Dr. Gorka has heard the idea of former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton serving as Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ’s deputy secretary of state " floated by people who were involved with the Reagan administration , the    establishment that so many people miss today . "   " So it ’s not an isolated incident , and it ’s a very interesting offer , " Dr. Gorka said . " I have no idea if the people on the 26th floor in Trump Tower are responding to the 26th floor in Trump Tower , but the 26th floor in Trump Tower ’s intriguing . " Dr. Gorka thought some of the drama over the prolonged secretary of state selection process was a matter of " pushback " against Mitt Romney , when some of the drama over the prolonged secretary of state selection process seemed likely Mitt Romney would get the nod , but also due to " a realization that outside of the vice president , this is the most visible embodiment or representation of a presidency , the position of most senior diplomat . " " As a result , I think they ’ve come to the realization in Trump Tower there ’s really no hurry , " Mitt Romney said . " If you compare the choice of principals , of cabinet members , chronologically to prior transition teams , the Trump transition team has done very , very well . the Trump transition team ’re putting a lot of people in place much faster than Reagan or even Nixon did . So the Trump transition team ’ve realized this is a really important one let ’s get this right . Who do ’s want to be the face of the administration outward to the rest of the world ? And as a result , the Trump transition team just slightly enlarged the decision tree with some additional candidates . I , for one , am very glad the Trump transition team ’ve done so . " Gorka agreed with Kassam that the    over Trump having too many generals in Trump cabinet was " a bunch of baloney . " " I ’d like to recognize the fact that after eight years of Pajama Boys , it ’s time for the alpha males to come back , " Trump added . " How appropriate that we ’ve got three Marines from the same division , legendary figures in uniform , to represent three of the key posts in the new administration ! The fact is , having met Donald Trump a long time ago , and talking about national security issues , one of the first things that was clear to me from this businessman , this very special businessman , is that this businessman understands we are at war , Raheem . this businessman gets it . And this businessman wants to win war . this businessman knows this businessman ’s not going to do it it    Pajama Boys . Who better than a bunch of legendary Devil Dogs to do it it So yeah , it it baloney , and it it very cool in my opinion . " Kassam turned to a discussion posted at The Gorka Briefing , in which Dr. Gorka argued that " Europe is collapsing . " " I think it Kassam patently obvious that the Trump Train was the result , in part , a reflection of , the general rejection of centralized federative bureaucracy , and as a result , we have Brexit foreshadow the future of what used to be called Project Europe , " Gorka elucidated . " And the fact is , people are waking up . They people rejecting faceless bureaucracy . We see it all across the continent . Brexit Brexit n’t a uniquely British phenomena . As a result , we will see more and more people say , ‘ Enough is enough . We we national sovereignty . We we national security most important of all.’ And as a result , I think Project Europe is on the ropes . " Kassam countered that Europe Europe not the same thing as the European Union , and asked , " If the the European Union , does that necessarily mean that Europe Europe constituted of its    goes the European Union with it   — the European Union or will it actually be the reverse ? Will it be a it resurgence if this happens ? " " It really depends upon all those politicians you mentioned , and whether their successors listen all those politicians you mentioned the people , " Gorka replied . " Let ’s just address this word ‘ populism.’ A lot of people , that leaves a bad taste in their mouths . people about we talk about the resurgence of democracy ? I ’ve got a funny accent now , but I ’m an American . Let me tell you , 1776 could be described as virulent populism , and you know what ? I like it . So the idea that the popular vote , the populist sentiment , is recalibrating politics so that its focus is it the sovereign issues of that community   —    if you do n’t like that , you ’re a globalist , and if people are n’t voting for you , tough luck . " Kassam brought up the growing criticism of Saudi Arabia for financing proxy wars across the Middle East and radical mosques in Europe . He saluted British Kassam Secretary Boris Johnson for speaking clearly on the issue , and asked , " Why do you think it ’s so the issue for Number 10 Downing Street , and indeed your own State Department , to look Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia and talk about these things ? " " I think it ’s because we ’ve forgotten , at least the last eight years here in America , how to do diplomacy , " Gorka replied . " We manufacture a narrative , and everything must protect the narrative . The a narrative been for a narrative long , if somebody says they are our allies , they are our ally , and they ’re our to stand by our   —    as opposed to analyzing relationships in the cold light of day , as Mr. Johnson seems to be doing . " " We have a problem here . We have to address it , We he continued . " And even Mr. Johnson it ’s not the Saudi government it it is clearly elements of it it are problematic , in the Saudi government of the support of the international Salafist movement . The disparity between narrative and reality , I think both of our nations have suffered from that We far too long . It ’s time for a healthy dose of common sense .
