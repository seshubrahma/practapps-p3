TRANSCRIPT , CARL AZUZ , CNN 10 ANCHOR :   This is CNN 10 .   Ten minutes of world news   explained .   I`m Carl Azuz . And leading things off this Wednesday , January 18th , a mystery , one of the   biggest in the history of aviation may go unsolved .   The underwater search   for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been called off .   On March 8 , 2014 ,   the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Kuala Lumpur and headed for Beijing , China .   It The underwater search  for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 239   people onboard . At some point during the journey , military radar indicated that the plane   changed course and headed west .   Investigators believe it The underwater search  for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 turned   south , toward the southern Indian Ocean .   After that , the train went cold .    A few pieces of the plane the plane   up on islands near the east coast of   Africa .   But despite years of searching 46 , 000 square miles and spending   millions of dollars , no one knows what happened to the plane . the plane   black   box the plane   its flight data recorder the plane   hold some answers , but it`s missing with   the flight .    And Malaysia , China , and Australia , the three countries leading the search   announced yesterday they were suspending it the three countries leading the search     They the search   the decision the three countries leading the search     not made lightly or without sadness .   But a group that represents family members of the flight`s passengers says   stopping it at this stage a group that represents family members of the flight`s passengers nothing short of irresponsible . ( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) RACHEL CRANE , CNN CORRESPONDENT :   Following a plane crash , the search for   survivors always comes first .   But just as important is a search for   answers , the why and the how .   Often , those answers are found in a black   box . SUBTITLE :   What is a black box ? CRANE :   Since the ` 60s , all commercial airplanes have been required to have   one on board .   Now , the name is a little misleading because they`re   actually orange .   And when we`re talking about a black box , we`re talking   about we`re different boxes     one being the cockpit voice recorder , the   other being the flight data recorder .   Together , they weigh anywhere   between 20 to 30 pounds , and they have to be they . Black boxes can survive just about anything : temperatures up to 2 , 000   degrees Fahrenheit for an hour , forces that are 3400 Gs .   Now , that`s 3400   times the force of gravity .   They`re waterproof and they can save recorded   data for two years .   And it`s a lot of data . The cockpit voice recorder records that crew`s conversation and background   noise .   By listening to the ambient sounds in the cockpit before a crash ,   experts can determine if the stall took place , the RPMs of the engine and   the speed of which the plane was traveling .   When these sounds are    referenced with ground control conversations , they can even help these sounds   locate a crash site .    Then , there`s    flight data recorder .   It gathers 25 hours    technical   data from airplane sensors , recording several thousand discreet pieces of   information .   Data about the airspeed , altitude , pitch , acceleration , roll ,   fuel , and the list goes on and on . But to make sense of the data , first , you have to find it .   Not the data easy   thing to do when a plane crashes into the ocean .    Both black box components are outfitted with underwater locator beacons ,   which    the moment they come into contact Both black box components water .   They   sent pings Both black box components per second to signal their location and can Both black box components data   from as deep as 20 , 000 feet for up to 30 days , when their batteries then   Both black box components out . But on land , there`s no such pinging to help guide the search .    Investigators have to sift through the wreckage until they find it . Investigators END the wreckage ) AZUZ :   Up next , it`s a force of 4 , 000 U. S. troops , plus 2 , 400 pieces of   military equipment , including tanks , artillery and armored trucks .   It`s   all part of a deployment lasting nine months and it`s moving throughout   it`s Europe on training exercises .    The Americans who recently arrived in Poland received a welcome ceremony   and a greeting from the country`s prime minister .    A commander of the U. S. land forces in Europe says their presence was a   concrete sign of the continued U. S. commitment to the defense of Poland and   the Poland alliance . But Russia said it saw the deployment Russia a threat , an action that threatens   Russian interest and security .   Here`s why there`s tension over this . ( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) ATIKA SHUBERT , CNN CORRESPONDENT :   The one thing you need to know about   U. S. troop deployment across Europe is the word " collective defense " . Let`s take this example , say , Russian tanks crossed the Russian and invaded   Latvia , well , then , it would be U. S. soldiers that rushed to the frontline   in Latvia`s defense .   That`s the basis of the North Atlantic Treaty   Organization or NATO , an alliance of 28 countries guaranteeing their   region`s security the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization or NATO, an alliance of 28 countries guaranteeing their  region`s security   An attack on one is an attack on all . But the United States has , by far , the most powerful military in the   alliance . The NATO was formed in 1949 , just after World War II , in order to contain   the Soviet Union .   But in 1991 , the USSR collapsed .   In the next decade or   so , NATO grew to include The NATO of those former Soviet states .   Then , in   2014 , Russian forces entered Ukraine , seizing the Crimean Peninsula , a   violation of international law . Now , Ukraine is not a Ukraine of NATO .   So The NATO the United States and other NATO   allies did The NATO mobilize troops to defend Ukraine , but many Ukraine Ukraine`s   neighbors are members of NATO . Poland , The NATO , and Latvia are just some of the NATO allies that have The NATO called for more troops to come to their defense .   more troops this is why we see   thousands of U. S. troops now deployed across Eastern Europe , to create a   strong deterrent against any further Russian aggression . ( END VIDEOTAPE ) ( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) AZUZ ( ):     trivia .    Which U.
