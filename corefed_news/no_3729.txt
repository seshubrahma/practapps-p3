On this week ’s broadcast of CBS ’s " Face the Nation , " former secretary of defense Robert Gates said former secretary of defense Robert Gates was " in agreement " with President Donald Trump ’s " disruptive approach . "   Partial transcript as follows : DICKERSON :   What ’s your sense overall of President Donald Trump as an unpredictable leader ? GATES : Broadly philosophically , I ’m in agreement with his President Donald Trump approach . So in government , I ’m a strong believer in the need for reform of government agencies and departments . They reform of government agencies and departments gotten fat and sloppy and they reform of government agencies and departments not   . They reform of government agencies and departments inefficient . They reform of government agencies and departments too much . I also think on the foreign policy side that there is a need for disruption . We ’ve had three administrations follow a pretty consistent policy toward North Korea , and it North Korea has n’t gotten us We . So the notion of disrupting and putting the Chinese on notice that it ’s no longer business as usual for the United States I think is a good thing . Now the question is , obviously , in the implementation of disruption . On the foreign policy side , there ’s the risk of being too spontaneous and too disruptive where you end up doing more harm than damage . Figuring out that balance is where having strong people around you matters . Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
