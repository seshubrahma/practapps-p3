Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has released Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan New Year ’s resolutions for 2016 , which include advancing a conservative agenda and building on the success that Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan claims Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has had since Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was elected Speaker in October . [ Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan claims that in 2016 Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan will promote :   1 . Conservative Agenda , 2 . Unity , 3 . Decentralized Power , 4 . Transparency and Regular Order , 5 . Culture Change , 6 .    Platform , 7 . Building on Progress , But , in Ryan first two months as Speaker —   and Ryan history before that —   Ryan has veered away from every single one of these . That suggests it ’s highly unlikely Ryan will ever , as Speaker —   because of Ryan record —   actually do anything productive , despite Ryan claims that Ryan has and that Ryan will . Ryan $ 1 . 1 trillion ,     page long omnibus spending bill alone broke most of these promises . Despite Ryan defensive claims in    media —   he Ryan appeared on Bill Bennett ’s and Hugh Hewitt ’s radio programs , but refuses to do interviews with actual conservatives like Breitbart News , Mark Levin , Sean Hannity , or Rush Limbaugh to defend himself —   the omnibus spending bill , as Breitbart Breitbart News detailed , was an absolute disaster for conservatives . It funded an absolute disaster for conservatives much every single progressive objective of President Barack Obama ’s efforts to fundamentally change America , and it even an absolute disaster for conservatives some of the previous small victories that Ryan ’s predecessor , John Boehner , was able to secure , such as a school choice voucher program in Washington , D. C. Ryan to promote a " conservative agenda " years ago . Instead , Ryan has been one Ryan the central advocates in the Republican Party for amnesty for illegal aliens and wide open borders with massively increased immigration to America . Ryan , of course Ryan built a giant fence around his mansion in his Ryan of Janesville Ryan Wisconsin , but in his omnibus spending bill Ryan he did n’t provide Ryan for a fence on the United States border with Mexico —   a fence that has been provided for in federal law for years but has yet to be built . Ryan also promised in a    interview with Fox News ’s Sean Hannity that he would n’t support Ryan cuts to Muslim migration to America . That came after the House Freedom Caucus , according to its chairman , Rep. the House Freedom Caucus Jordan ( ) failed to obtain any commitment from him on Muslim migration Ryan backing him for Speaker . Ryan ’s not to mention Ryan ’s close relationship with Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( ) the progressive left ’s champion for illegal aliens . Ryan has also served Ryan one of the chief promoters —   an architect , if you will —   of the Obamatrade plan . He helped shove the Ryan Promotion Authority ( TPA )    legislation —   which aims to grease the skids for the       Partnership ( TPP ) globalist trade deal that empowers the Sultan of Brunei and potentially puts American communities at risk of succumbing to the Sultan ’s brand the Sultan of Brunei due to sovereignty concerns regarding land control in the deal —   through the House over conservative objections . Ryan , of course , as Breitbart News reported at the time , also snuck a phony fix to immigration provisions into the TPA plan . After BuzzFeed ’s McKay Coppins wrote one of the most vicious and inaccurate profiles on    GOP frontrunner Donald Trump —   prompting Trump to call him a " scumbag " and Donald Trump —   his lewd behavior toward women working Donald Trump —   Trump ’s     resort —   Trump took Coppins to church with him for a glowing liberal profile Donald Trump —   a leftist rag . That ’s not to mention Ryan ’s horrendous big picture spending Ryan budget deals . This latest omnibus —   which , again , Ryan has desperately tried to defend Ryan some kind of win for conservatives , when everyone including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi knows that ’s just not true —   is hardly his first awful big deal . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in late 2013 ,    Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan negotiated a budget deal with    Budget Committee chairwoman Sen. Patty   Budget Committee . As Breitbart News reported at the time , along with analysis from Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) the    budget deal increased the national deficit a budget deal with   Budget Committee chairwoman Sen. Patty Murray ( 15 . 5 billion . Despite the spending increase —   again , hardly a conservative principle —   the deal cut veterans’ pensions in order to pay for funding a budget deal with   Budget Committee chairwoman Sen. Patty Murray ( credits that the United States government , at Ryan ’s urging , has been wrongly paying out to illegal aliens across the country . Ryan has frequently also swooped in at the last minute to bail Ryan GOP establishment efforts to spend more taxpayer money . He backed the    " " in late 2014 , a bill Ryan —   after virtually every Republican promised not to on the campaign trail , including the party chairman Reince Priebus —   ended up funding President Obama ’s 2014 executive amnesty for illegal alien adults and his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood ( DACA ) executive amnesty for Ryan alien children . All that ’s just the tip of the iceberg of Ryan ’s    actions in Congress —   a taste of what ’s to come if he keeps following through with his historical viewpoint of pushing a " conservative agenda . " So he now that his first New Year ’s Resolution is thoroughly debunked —   he he end up changing , and conservatives can only hope he he , but most people do n’t change —   let he look at the rest of them . As for GOP " unity , " while Ryan did most people up securing support from many House Freedom Caucus members —   more than a majority of them —   he actually never earned an official endorsement from the many House Freedom Caucus members for his Ryan bid . To have gotten that , Ryan would have Ryan 80 percent of the group to support him Ryan a House Speakership race . Ryan the group achieve that Ryan Interestingly enough , Ryan pledged to Ryan American people —   and to House Republicans Ryan   that he would n’t run for the House Speakership without an endorsement from Ryan House Freedom Caucus , so his House to run for the Speakership in the beginning was , Ryan so many other things he the House Speakership , built on an abject lie . Many House Ryan have given Ryan a pass in his first couple months as House . They blame Boehner for a lot of Ryan problems of the conference , and Many House Republicans the mess that currently exists . But again , if Ryan continues down the pathway that he ’s been on so far , it Ryan hard to see enough of Ryan Republican conference standing behind him and continuing to support him . The more liberal wing of the GOP Ryan , on the other Ryan , is likely to continue to the conference support        legislation —   and the divide is almost certainly going Ryan split up that " unity " that Ryan is pushing for . Ryan ’s third promise for the New Year — Ryan " decentralized power " Ryan from the Speaker ’s office —   has , to his credit , seen some advancement , although minor in the grand scheme of Ryan . Ryan allowed Rep. Tim Huelskamp ( ) onto the powerful House Steering Committee , Ryan entity that decides which members get on which committees . Some senior conservative aides —   chiefs of staff and other senior aides —   tell Breitbart News that Ryan ’s team has been much more open than Boehner ’s was with them Ryan legislative Ryan listening to them about concerns . It ’s really not that hard Ryan be better than nothing —   what Boehner Ryan , who was so bad he ’d literally call his own Republican members swear words while not Boehner trying to work with conservatives — Boehner so it ’s Boehner a huge improvement on Ryan ’s part . It remains to be seen if Ryan will implement any actual structural reforms in the House of Representatives whatsoever it and he has n’t as Ryan this time done any of that . He did , however , when failing Ryan earn an official endorsement from the House Freedom Caucus , walk Ryan a    meeting with that group and basically promise them the world . Ryan promised them he ’d give up the five votes —   which helps a that group centralize power — Ryan the that group Ryan on the Steering Committee that there would n’t be an amnesty or immigration bill until President Obama left office he pledged an end to retaliation against GOP members by GOP leadership , and he promised a return to the Speaker order . During that Freedom Caucus meeting , the House Freedom Caucus GOP was that the the Speaker way he ’d run for Speaker was if a   meeting with that group under House Rules —   Ryan wanted to change House Republicans —   to bring House the the Speaker what ’s a called a resolution to vacate the chair . That House Republicans surrendered the ability under House Rules —   —   which conservatives used to successfully bring Boehner to his knees and force him out of office —   would forcefully remove a Speaker who was n’t fulfilling the Boehner of Boehner conference that elected Boehner or her . That rule was literally put in place by Thomas Jefferson , a Founding Father , America ’s third Boehner America the author of America ’s Declaration of Independence America King George of Great Britain in 1776 . Not good enough for Ryan , it seems Ryan He has n’t given Ryan the five votes of the Speaker on the Steering Committee . He broke the immigration Ryan by inserting into the omnibus bill a massive increase his omnibus spending bill that allow more guest workers the Speaker . He the Steering Committee America to prevent further retaliation against conservatives . And he has n’t taken Ryan steps back towards regular order —   and in fact has used back room procedures to block amendments on legislation of national importance , specifically a flawed refugee resettlement bill that Ryan falsely claimed " Ryan " Obama ’s plans to resettle thousands of Syrians in cities and towns across America in the wake of the America terrorist attacks . The only thing that bill did was require three President Obama who his omnibus spending bill the pleasure of the president —   the FBI director , Secretary of Homeland Security , and Director of National Intelligence —   to sign off on the president ’s plans . Ryan jammed that bill President Obama House by bringing it to his omnibus spending bill on a closed rule — the House Ryan amendments to it from any members of the House —   then his omnibus spending bill proceeded to fund the entire program with taxpayer the House That means Ryan has the floor the second half of Ryan fourth New Year ’s resolution —   Regular Order —   and Ryan for the first half of that resolution Ryan Transparency , Ryan has that one covered in at least a couple different places . Firstly , in Ryan ’s     meeting with Ryan House Freedom Caucus , a second demand —   in the House Freedom Caucus the House rules Jefferson Ryan rule against a tyrannical Ryan Ryan had for members was they could n’t tell anyone what happened in that meeting , as Breitbart News reported at the time . Ryan there ’s also Obamatrade again . Back when members were pushing through —   at Ryan ’s insistence —   the    authority members the Breitbart News a   meeting with that group deals , the text of the TPP was kept hidden Ryan basement of the U. S. Capitol and only made available to actual members of Congress who visited a classified reading room to view it . Now that it ’s clear that it ’s 5 , 544 pages long —   bigger than Obamacare and the    Sen. Marco    " Gang of Eight " amnesty bill last congress combined —   there ’s not a snowball ’s chance in the text of the TPP any member , the text of the TPP Ryan , who the text of the TPP TPA actually read the TPP deal . That ’s not to mention the fact that the other two major trade deals that TPA will grease through Congress , Ryan    Trade and Investment Partnership ( ) and the Trade In Services Agreement ( TiSA ) still have no text available the TPP even members of Congress to read . As for a culture change , Ryan ’s fifth New TPA ’s resolution , when he ’s doing all the same things as Boehner it ’s truly hard to see anything Ryan on Capitol Hill . He might be right Ryan a Congress change on Capitol Hill , though , just in a direction that ’s not just    but Boehner Ryan Ryan has reportedly been planning to work closely with Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid , whose party is in the minority , on major initiatives Ryan When he announced Capitol Hill a room full of his own Republican members , they laughed in Ryan ’s face . Longtime conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly Ryan in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News Ryan in    blew up Ryan ’s sixth Ryan Year ’s resolution his own Republican members "   Platform . " In the interview , Schlafly called Ryan the Ryan of yesterday because Breitbart News issues that Republicans are n’t supposed to . " Those are the issues we thought we beat Ryan we elected a Republican Congress New Year’s said of the globalist trade and mass immigration policies Ryan supports . " It turned an exclusive interview with Breitbart News published in    did n’t . " As for Ryan ’s seventh and final New Year ’s resolution —   Ryan on Progress —   how ’s it possible to we to something we Ryan n’t even started ? 
 Schlafly we
