On Wednesday ’s " MSNBC Live , " anchor Stephanie Ruhle , New York Times columnist Frank Bruni , and journalist Tina Brown discussed the 2016 election and political correctness , and during that discussion , Ruhle wondered if political correctness has prevented people from saying things that are important , and Bruni and Brown concluded that when people feel people ’ll be attacked for speaking people minds , people find an outlet like    Donald Trump .   Ruhle asked , " Did we    things ? Did we believe that Hillary Clinton and this    global citizen message does represent the United States , and thought that this base that Donald Trump had really was just in this narrow nationalist vertical ? When many of the initiatives that represent Obama   …     many people could say transgender bathrooms in high schools , how many people is that going to impact in this country ? Not so many . " Bruni stated that the Democratic Party has become a " collection of boutique issues , " and that doing so leads a lot of the this country feel ignored . He added that the Democratic the Democratic Party " do some big    here . " Bruni also Bruni , " She was Bruni a candidate that fit this moment at all . They were trying to sell a product at the wrong time , and they refused to see They , or they just could n’t They a way around her , Bruni here we are with Donald Trump over your shoulder . " Ruhle then wondered if the polls were wrong " because so many of us are afraid to we what matters . I mean , in terms of political correctness , if you run a small business , and I mean a lawyer , an architect , when you say , guess what , I ca n’t afford to give the five people who work for me   —    if they ’re women , the five people who work for me   ca n’t afford to give them 20 weeks maternity they’re women . Or , Obamacare might help the rest of the country , but in my business , if I have 20 people who are working for me , it might put me Obamacare of business . Were we afraid to admit that we ca n’t afford we help everyone ? " Brown responded that the problem is people are afraid to discuss issues like that " because of the velocity of social media attack when you really try to have a conversation about anything like that . I mean , I ’ve often said , actually as an employer myself , that nobody really wants to talk about , well then , how do we manage all of this time off for people ? " And that while there is a solution to this , it needs to be this . Bruni added that " when people are silenced , when they feel like simply people , I do n’t agree with Obamacare , or I do n’t agree with transgender bathrooms , but , if they feel like saying people , it immediately gets them branded , whether people ’s on social it , or whether it ’s by people it in a studio , it gets them branded it bigot people a deplorable . They ’re going to people , and they ’re going to people some sort of outlet for that seething , and the outlet is Donald outlet the 45th president of the United States . " Brown agreed that it was similar with Brexit , where there was a " secret conversation " about immigration anxiety . " If you raise that conversation in any way publicly , you were a racist . You were a xenophobe . And if you ca n’t have a conversation , it boils underneath and then it explodes . It ’s it dangerous . it Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
