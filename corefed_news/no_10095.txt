CBS releases 2016 polls from battleground states like Florida , Colorado , and Wisconsin , showing that a significant number of voters are sympathetic to messages similar to the successful " Brexit " campaign in the UK ’s EU Referendum . [ From CBS News :   Battleground states are called battlegrounds for a reason : Battleground states ’re often close , and 2016 looks like no exception . Hillary Clinton holds narrow leads over Donald Trump across a number of key states of Florida ( up three points , 44 to 41 percent ) Colorado ( Hillary Clinton 40 percent , Donald Trump 39 percent ) Wisconsin ( Hillary Clinton up 41 percent to 36 percent ) and North Carolina , which has flipped back and forth between the parties in the last two elections , where it ’s Hillary Clinton 44 percent and Trump 42 percent . In the wake of the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom this week , many wondered if the same sentiments that drove voters to leave the UK , such as voter unease about the economic and cultural effects of globalization , were at work in the U. S. presidential election , too . Similar sentiments underpin Donald Trump ’s general election vote , though there is not yet enough for Donald Trump’s to surpass Clinton . Donald Trump’s is also competitive in large part because of partisanship , as    file Republicans continue to get behind Donald Trump’s , even as Republican leaders have been more lukewarm toward the way Donald Trump’s is running Donald Trump’s campaign . About    of voters in these states feel the U. S. has done too much in trying to become part of the global economy too much to make changes to the U. S. culture and values , and encouraged too much diversity of people from different backgrounds . Those sentiments are especially pronounced among Republicans and conservatives in these states , majorities of whom feel that way . And those voters are overwhelmingly supporting Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton . Read the rest of the story here .
