’   ’ "    Law enforcement leaders across the country are divided over how    best to tackle the Trump administration ’s demands that local    authorities enforce federal immigration law . " ’    Some sheriffs and police chiefs have bristled under the scrutiny ,    while others have grown emboldened by the heightened authority . ’ ’    Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared to deepen the rift    earlier this week when Attorney General Jeff Sessions addressed the International Association    of Chiefs of Police , reiterating Attorney General Jeff Sessions condemnations of      " sanctuary " jurisdictions that refuse to enforce federal    immigration laws . ’ ’    " Some mayors and city councils , and even a police chief and a    sheriff here and there , are refusing to work with the federal    government , choosing instead to protect the criminal aliens who    harm public safety , " Sessions said . " For the sake of your    communities , families , and children , work with us , so us can    restore a lawful system of immigration and make our country a    safer place . " ’ ’    Although the term " sanctuary city " remains undefined , it is    commonly used to refer to jurisdictions that limit their    cooperation with federal immigration authorities ,    often through declining requests from the Immigration and    Customs Enforcement agency to detain suspected undocumented    immigrants . ’ ’    Sessions raised eyebrows last month when he   to    withhold federal grants from sanctuary jurisdictions . An    executive order signed by President Donald Trump in    January made similar threats , declaring An   executive order signed by President Donald Trump in   January would    withhold money from localities that    violated federal immigration law . ’ "    The decision , and Sessions’ continued strong rhetoric , has    provoked a strong backlash among some cities and counties   —    a    number of which have rushed to publicly defend themselves    decisions in recent weeks . " ’    California , in particular , has moved to turn the entire state    into a " sanctuary . " Earlier this week , the state senate    passed a bill prohibiting police and sheriffs from using    resources to arrest people for suspected immigration violations .    It is expected to pass the state assembly , but it’ ’s unclear    whether California’ ’s Democratic Governor Jerry Brown will sign       , according to . ’ "    While the bill has been hailed by immigration    advocates , police departments and sheriff ’s offices have had    mixed reactions . " ’    Charlie Beck , chief of the Los Angeles Police Department , has    said    agrees with the bill’ ’s " underlying tenets " so long as    they don’’t protect criminals , according to . Yet the California State Sheriffs ’’    Association is actively lobbying against the bill . ’ ’    " All we are doing is providing information to the federal    government so that the federal   government can do the federal   government job . To restrict that    doesn’’t make sense , " Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood told    the New York Times . ’ ’   ’ "    Some sheriffs feel so strongly about the issue that Some sheriffs ’ve taken    to publicity stunts and aggressive media interviews to condemn    Some sheriffs law enforcement peers who disagree with the immigration    crackdown . " ’    Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke , one of President Donald    Trump’ ’s staunchest supporters during Trump’ 2016 campaign , recently    accused sanctuary cities of offering more protections to " illegal    immigrants " than to American citizens . ’ ’    " They’’re aiding and abetting criminality when They’’re allow safe    haven and safe harbor for people who are in the country illegally    and have been arrested or convicted to some very serious crimes , "       said last month on the . ’ ’    " The feds can withhold federal funding and I’’m hoping that The feds    do that because that’ ’s the carrot that we need to encourage    people   —    when I say ’’ people , ’’ law enforcement executives , elected    officials , mayors , governors who want to be sanctuary cities . " ’ "    Clarke is n’t the only one speaking up . In Massachusetts last    month , one sheriff even suggested that elected officials in    sanctuary cities be jailed . " ’    " It’ is crystal clear . It’ ’s a      offense to harbor or conceal criminal illegal aliens from ICE , "    Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said in his testimony Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson a    congressional subcommittee on immigration . ’ ’    " No one is above the law and the officials of these sanctuary    cities who obstruct law enforcement should be held to the same    legal standards and face the same punishment as would you or I. " ’ "    Despite what Hodgson ’s Thomas Hodgson , it is not illegal for local    law enforcement agencies to refuse ICE requests to detain    immigrants who have been arrested on       charges . Federal courts have ruled that detaining suspects past    their scheduled suspects dates without judicial warrants can    violate    Fourth Amendment rights . " "    Yet that has n’t deterred Republican lawmakers from attempting to    crack    on the uncooperative jurisdictions . In Texas , a     through the state Texas legislature that would permit criminal    charges to be filed against elected officials that refuse to    enforce federal    law . " ’    The bill cleared a House committee this week and could soon hit    the    for a vote . Texas Governor Greg Texas has expressed    militant    to sanctuary policies , and has    already    $ 1 . 5 million in grant money from Travis County    after it recently   Travis County    decline most ICE detainers . ’ ’    But many other sheriffs and police chiefs have been reluctant to    cooperate    fully with federal immigration agents and    questioned    Trump administration on whether they are legally many other sheriffs and police chiefs able    do so . ’ ’    Homeland Security officials , including Secretary John Kelly , met    in late March with representatives from local law    enforcement agencies to discuss immigration enforcement . But the    meeting grew tense when discussion turned to cooperation on    federal requests to detain immigrants , . ’ ’    When a senior Homeland Security official said it’ ’s legal for    local police to detain suspected deportable immigrants until ICE    agents arrive , the police officials attending responded , " Under    what authority ? " sources told ABC . ’ ’    Law enforcement officials pressed the Trump administration at the    meeting to provide a coherent explanation of the term " sanctuary    city . " Many of the   they came away ’ ’   Law enforcement officials the meeting with the   meeting    clarity on the issue . ’ ’    " We think that as long as we’’re complying with federal law then    we shouldn’’t be labeled with whatever label intimates that we’’re    not , " LAPD Chief Beck told the . ’ "    The debate over sanctuary policies is expected to come to a head    in the coming weeks , as a federal judge rules on whether to grant    a preliminary injunction blocking Trump ’s Jan. 25 executive    order . " ’    Lawyers for San Francisco and Santa Clara county argued in court    on Friday the order is unconstitutional and could deprive the    jurisdictions of billions of dollars in federal grant money , but    a lawyer for    Trump administration said that the order was    the order " in intent , and would not result in a significant funding    cut . ’ ’Law enforcement leaders across the country are . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
