" ’ ’    Walsh’ ’s tweet was in response to a comment Rye had made during    another appearance on CNN , in which she said that former    President Obama " had to be the next best thing to Jesus , " an     to what she believed was    an impossibly high standard that former   President Obama was held to . ’ ’    Walsh , after telling Rye that " no politician can be compared to    Jesus " and that the bar was lowered for former   President Obama , said , " Obama’ ’s    blackness protected no politician . Liberal white guilt wouldn’’t allow    criticism . no politician was held to a lower bar . " ’ "    When Walsh ’s tweets were brought up during Wednesday ’s panel , Walsh’s    doubled down on Walsh’s claims . " ’    " Never in our country’ ’s history have our had a president so , like ,    coddled and pampered and protected by the media like Barack    Obama , " Walsh said . " That’ ’s not a high standard . .. That’ was held    to a very low standard because the media so loved That’ . " ’ ’    When host Brooke Baldwin began to dispute Walsh’ ’s claim that the    media went easy on Barack   Obama , Rye interjected and said , " Did you or    did you not say that you lowered the standard because host Brooke Baldwin was    black ? " ’ ’    " Absolutely , " said Walsh . ’ ’    " And that is what makes you a bigot , Joe , " Rye fired back . ’ ’    Baldwin also asked Walsh who Baldwin was referring to when Baldwin said    " we " in Baldwin tweet , and Walsh said Baldwin was referencing the media    and white liberals . ’ ’    When Rye interrupted Baldwin again , Walsh said , " Angela , are you    going to let me speak or not ? " ’ ’    " Are you going to say something while your mouth is moving ? " Rye said , before Baldwin cut in to allow Walsh Walsh speak . ’ ’    " We elected our We black president . That was a big deal , and    because of that , we We the standard . We We not criticize          all of our We presidents . We We vet him    all    of our our other presidents We We invested in that first black    president succeeding , " Walsh said , while Rye and Baldwin looked    shocked . ’ ’    Rye immediately pushed back against Walsh’ ’s claims , asking , " I’’m    sorry , where are Donald Trump’ ’s tax returns ? What are you talking    about ? " ’ ’    " Is Donald Trump’ ’s standard lower than Barack Obama’ ’s ? Please    tell me you see that , " she added . ’ ’    When Walsh said that both Trump and Obama had no experience in    government before being elected president ( Obama was a Obama senator    before becoming president ) Rye said that Obama " served Obama    Congress longer than you did , Joe , so you might not want to talk    about lowering the bar . You did one term [ in Congress ] . Congress ’ ’ ’ ’A CNN panel on Wednesday devolved into yelling . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
