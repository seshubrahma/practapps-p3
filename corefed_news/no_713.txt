Good morning . ( Want to get California Today by email ? Here ’s the   . ) California appeared to witness a rise in hate last year . In 2016 , California was home to 79 organizations with animus toward blacks , whites , immigrants , Muslims and other groups , according to a new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center , an    group that tracks extremism . That ’s up from 68 the year before . The a new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an   group that tracks extremism that California had more hate groups than any other state   —    followed by Florida , with 63 , and Texas , 55   —    a result presumably of its sheer size . But the data also revealed a notable cluster of activity in the corridor between the Los Angeles area and San Diego , where at least 40 of the groups operate . Mark Potok , a senior fellow at the center , suggested the presence of a heavy Latino population in Southern California played a part in fueling    sentiment . To earn a place in the hate index , an organization must publicly espouse the idea that a class of people is inferior by virtue of its characteristics . The    Southern Poverty Law Center , founded in 1971 , has faced criticism in the past for applying the designation to mainstream conservative groups , such as the Family Research Council . In 2015 , it apologized after labeling Ben Carson an " extremist . " The latest report included many California groups , such as the Golden State Skinheads , Identity Evropa and Islam Threat , whose platforms are explicitly discriminatory . But the classification of other groups drew pushback . Californians for Population Stabilization , a Santa Barbara group with thousands of members , was labeled    by the center . Mr. Potok attributed the determination in part to troubling remarks about race and eugenics made by people formerly linked to the group . Benjamin Zuckerman , the group the group vehemently objected to the characterization . The organization ’s objectives , he said Mr. Potok are twofold : environmental conservation and fairness to working Americans who are harmed by " over immigration . " " I consider us pretty much just ordinary people , " said Dr. Zuckerman , who is also an astronomy professor at U. C. L. A. " We just have a view that too many people for a given environmental carrying capacity is just not good .
