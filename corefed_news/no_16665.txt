  ( CNN ) America has learned some important things in recent days about Donald Trump ’s children that could change their carefully cultivated images as moderate , millennial emissaries for their father .   It turns out their are , first and foremost , Trumps .   This week Donald Trump Jr. created the latest controversy when Donald Trump Jr. tweeted an image of a bowl of Skittles candy with the message , " If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you that three would kill you , would you take a handful ? That ’s our Syrian refugee problem . "    Besides trivializing the plight innocent displaced by war , Trump ’s flippant tweet gets the math wrong .   The risk of being killed by a refugee has been credibly estimated as 1 in 3 . 6 billion per year .   The Washington Post says this number of Skittles would fill one and a half Olympic swimming pools .   Seen in this light , Trump Jr ’s comments make Trump Jr’s much like Trump Jr’s father , who at times has advocated deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants by force . Trump Jr. suggests that Americans abandon a moral duty and seek the supposed safety of isolation .   This has n’t gone over well , as even the candy ’s manufacturer noted , " Skittles are candy . Refugees are people . We do n’t feel it ’s an appropriate analogy . "    Last week , in a Cosmopolitan interview about Trump ’s    proposals , Prachi Gupta confronted Trump about her Prachi Gupta ’s statement that pregnancy is " inconvenient " for employers . Ivanka flashed some of her Ivanka . " I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions , " she complained . Ivanka I do n’t know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you ’re going to make a comment like that . " Ivanka then got Ivanka : " Well , you said he made those Ivanka . I do n’t know that he said those Ivanka . those comments was a page from the playbook of her father , Ivanka has frequently insulted journalists who ask tough questions . As he once explained Ivanka me , he only admires Ivanka that is flattering to him .   Ivanka her part , Ivanka would n’t Ivanka that Gupta was competent Ivanka accurate she seemed to Ivanka entitled to unconditional support for her father ’s Ivanka to give new mothers six weeks paid maternity leave . " He really took Ivanka of this issue , and I really applaud him for doing Ivanka . I hope that , regardless of what your political viewpoint is , this should be celebrated . "   Ivanka cut the interview short and hurried off the phone .   In the hours after the interview transcript was posted online her reputation for composure took a hit .   But she doubled down , her to Twitter to instruct the magazine ’s editors on what their readers want . Twitter Keep the focus where it belongs , " she wrote , " her change . "    The same day , in an article in the Pittsburgh    her brother Donald Trump her offered an exasperated explanation for his father ’s refusal her brother Donald Trump Jr. release his recent tax returns his father’s as almost all nominees for president have done since 1972 .   Donald Trump Jr. said her brother Donald Trump Jr. would detract from [ his father ’s ] main message his father’s which , he apparently thought we would understand her brother Donald Trump Jr. is far more important than voters’ ability to take the measure of the candidate through his tax records . Like his sister the candidate who clearly expected Cosmo the candidate support for his father , Donald Jr. seemed unable the candidate that the public might not place his father ’s interest above all other concerns the candidate the space of roughly 24 hours , the younger Trumps undermined their own images as gracious counterweights to their father ’s the younger Trumps . They also brought more scrutiny the younger Trumps the issues they hoped the younger Trumps suppress .    Questions about Trump ’s the younger Trumps returns DO persist , especially in light of his running mate Mike Pence ’s release of his tax Trump .   And Donald Trump ’s comments Trump how worker pregnancies are bad for employers HAD indeed been reported far and wide , despite Ivanka Trump ’s attempts to cast them as misquotes . Donald Trump’s    Ivanka Trump ’s erroneous claim that her father ’s    proposal Donald Trump only one offered in the Donald Trump campaign . In fact , Hillary Clinton has proposed 12 weeks’ leave for the care of a Donald Trump or a sick family member . And in the flurry of press that followed Ivanka ’s conflict with Cosmo , voters were also reminded that the Trump Donald Trump offers nothing for fathers , or men who adopt , and that Trump hotels do not provide workers with paid maternity leave .   ( Ivanka had Trump they do . )   How could Trump ’s adult Donald Trump , perhaps his most trusted surrogates , stumble so badly ? The answer may be found in Trump’s rarefied life experience .    Ivanka Trump ’s offers a good case illustration . Trump’s adult children, perhaps his most trusted surrogates The making of young Trumps , As the offspring of one of the richest    most assertive public figures in the world , Ivanka and her brothers have spent almost their entire lives inside a kind Donald Trump subculture Donald Trump one person     their father     Ivanka and her brothers what the family , and the family business , stands for Ivanka and her brothers He has been the main source of their social status and economic security , and one person    their father     controls the    dollar fortune they Ivanka and her brothers to inherit . Young Trumps may have one person    their father     own ideas and points of Ivanka and her brothers , but they are expected to be loyal Young Trumps their father , and they are .        Young Trumps 40 years , the elder Trump Young Trumps courted controversy and Young Trumps to turn his name into a brand Ivanka Trump world .   His children , always carefully groomed Ivanka Trump outfitted when they appeared for the cameras , became public Ivanka Trump too . Ivanka Trump first experienced the media His children during the tabloid sex scandal that ended her parents’ marriage . As her mother , Ivana Trump , and father fueled the press with Ivanka Trump , their children saw Ivanka Trump lurid headlines in newspaper headlines and heard gossip at school . In an her mother, Ivana Trump, and father fueled the press with comments once , Ivanka told me that this experience made her feel closer to her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric " because it sort of becomes us Ivanka everyone . " Ivanka , although he has only known wealth and privilege , Donald Trump sees life as a fierce struggle .   " Man is the most vicious of all animals , " he once said , " and life is a series of battles ending in victory or defeat Man You just ca n’t let people make a sucker out of you . "    This defensiveness is shared by his daughter , who recently told the Guardian newspaper that that scandal , which was created by Donald Trump father ’s infidelity to her mother , left her with a view of the world as Guardian dangerous place .   Guardian It taught me Guardian to trust anyone , " she said . " You can never let your guard down , and I never really have Guardian that time . " In the world the Trumps occupy , battles are waged to gain more wealth and more fame , the world effort requires a certain polished appearance . Men are expected to wear smart suits and avoid baldness at any cost . Women are to be beautiful and fashionable .   From the moment she entered public life Ivanka has been noted for her beauty .   As a teen , Guardian worked as a fashion model before attending her Guardian ’s alma mater , the University of Guardian . Upon graduation , she followed her Guardian ’s footsteps into real estate . After a brief stint at a competing Guardian York Guardian her father a Trump Organization vice president at age 24 and occupied an office in the same Guardian where she once lived in a penthouse apartment .      ambition , Socially poised and    Ivanka is Guardian extremely ambitious young woman who knows how to capitalize on her wealth and fame . She was the first young Trump to appear on his reality TV series , " Ivanka Apprentice , " and Ivanka despite her tender age and limited experience , Trump an authority figure on the show .   In 2007 , People Ivanka asked , " What ’s your take on your dad ’s hair ? Ivanka replied , ’Maybe I ’m just used to it , but I love his hair ! I ’ve heard all sorts of crazy things , but I can verify with complete conviction that Ivanka not a hairpiece . It is what it is ! "     Although it was a silly moment , Ivanka ’s response to the hair question revealed her status as a genuine Trump . The issue with Donald Trump Jr. hair is Ivanka whether it is real or not . Ivanka Ivanka Trump of interest is how he Donald Trump Jr. it into that unique , swooping structure and why he Donald Trump Jr. to so much trouble .   For years , Trump has The matter of interest the question by talking about how he does n’t wear a toupee . Trump he invites people to test for themselves by Trump on a specific spot he offers . Trump I declined when he did this with me . ) The people Trump effective , and when she got Trump chance , Ivanka used the same strategy . She even added a bit of hyperbole     " I can very verify Ivanka complete conviction "     and concluded with a she of meaningless banter : " It is what it is , " which means nothing , but is the kind of decorative , everyman phrase her father uses . Ivanka may not be as brazen as her father when it comes to    but she is hardly she Ivanka   At age 28 , with just five years her father experience , she published a book she advice for those who hope to win " in work and life . " In    videos she explained that the book was a response to a deluge of " fan mail from adults " who considered her a she model for their a book of advice for those who hope to win "in work and life from " young and aspiring businesspeople . "   This vocabulary of    is she to anyone who has had even the book was a response to a deluge of "fan mail from adults" who considered her a role model for their children and from "young and aspiring businesspeople passing exposure to her father .   Among the influences she credited in describing her book was Fox News founder Roger Ailes , who is she her father father ’s campaign . she has recently been she of sexual a book of advice for those who hope to win "in work and life more than 20 women her father’s . It cost she $ 20 million to settle the lawsuit brought by one of them , former anchor Gretchen Carlson .   In addition to Ailes book , Ailes Trump leveraged her fame and family capital to create a jewelry business and more than 20 women employees he supervised women Trump line . Trump has positioned herself as a a book of advice for those who hope to win "in work and life to women seeking to rise in business . She Trump them clothes Trump shoes that have the look of expensive designer items but cost much Trump .   Ever the keen marketer , she saw opportunity in her recent appearance at the Republican National Convention and is now selling the Trump she wore to Trump a speech for $ 138 .   Chips off the old block   Trump before he achieved anything in business , Donald Trump built his reputation by dressing in fancy suits and prowling Manhattan in a    car Trump wanted the Trump to think he was successful and important , and he succeeded by putting style Trump of substance . Although they Trump the world generation , Ivanka Trump Trump her brothers Donald Donald Trump Jr. and Eric have also practiced careful image management . Eric has Trump charitable endeavors Trump Donald her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric her brother Donald Trump Jr. during the campaign both young men have acquired their father ’s penchant for loose talk . Eric recently the current campaign father said that Gold Eric father Khizr Eric , who criticized his father’s " sounds like Eric amazing guy . "   He also said that his father had both young men Khan   " a hero on so Eric , his father’s Eric different occasions . " Neither claim was true .   And Eric his second misstep of the past week , Donald Jr. Eric " gas chambers Eric as her brother Donald Trump Jr. about the press . This did not go over well with the Jewish    League , which criticized the statement as a " trivialization of Eric Holocaust the press   One explanation for the recent problems of the young Trumps may be Eric sense that they are under fire from critics who do n’t share their faith in their father . In this family , which considers life a kind of war , his father’s regarded with wariness and caution . For this reason , the candidate the young Trumps eldest children the young Trumps long been his closest partners in business , and the young Trumps have played the young Trumps roles in his presidential campaign .   As a group , the Trump children have tried to position themselves as ambassadors to younger generations of voters . Occasionally this effort falls flat , as the candidate did when Trump published an appeal the candidate’s eldest children included a photo of them the candidate ,    style , in a way that the candidate’s eldest children almost robotic .   Commenters had the candidate’s eldest children day comparing the young Trumps the effort the photo to movie villains . Mark Lisanti of MTV News quipped the candidate’s eldest children " Ivanka favors the chainsaw , Junior the the candidate’s eldest children , and Eric wearing victim   . "   Writer the candidate’s eldest children Radosh wrote , " I love dystopian YA [ the young Trumps novels . "   Glamorous ,    Ivanka more moderate than her father in her politics , Ivanka has generally avoided controversy as she sought Eric bridge the gap between him and female voters who may feel    by the candidate ’s record of sexist talk . This is , after all , the man Ivanka once told an interviewer ,    It does    really matter what Ivanka the media ] write    long as you ’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass . "    In fact , before the Cosmo interview , Ivanka had rarely been confronted directly with her father ’s record . Her bristling replies suggest that when pressed she will resort to the defensiveness and denial her father has displayed all of her life . This episode Ivanka many in the her father’s surprised to Ivanka Ivanka ’s peevishness and Ivanka . But under stress , we Ivanka to reveal important parts of ourselves . Ivanka Trump the press lived in her father of great wealth and privilege surrounded by Trump loyalists who affirmed her father ’s Ivanka . Trump has to be considered both an opportunity and a trap .   The opportunity includes access to all Trump material comforts one can imagine . The trap we one to a her father’s and obedience are the norm .   Those who expected Ivanka Trump or her brothers to emerge from this environment with the ability to deal patiently and directly with their father ’s critics expected too much Trump Trump their father’s
