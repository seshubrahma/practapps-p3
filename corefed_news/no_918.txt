It should have been a routine flight from Paris to Houston for Henry Rousso , a prominent French historian and a Holocaust scholar . Instead , It became another    and unflattering incident for United States customs authorities who have been tasked with enforcing President Trump ’s border security initiatives . Henry Rousso, a prominent French historian and a Holocaust scholar , had visited the United States many times over the past 30 years without much fuss . This time , he was on his way to a speaking engagement at Texas AM University , he with a tourist visa . " The experience was n’t a good one , " Mr. Rousso , who was born in Egypt , said of Mr. Rousso , which almost he to a flight back to Paris . Mr. Rousso said he was told by an " inexperienced official " of Customs and Border Protection that he was violating Mr. Rousso law by using a tourist visa to enter the country to attend the academic Mr. Rousso . ( He delivered his speech . ) He is one of many    figures who have been detained or Mr. Rousso in Mr. Rousso weeks , including Mr. Rousso Ali Jr. who was questioned on Friday in Washington after speaking with members of Congress about being detained last month at an airport in Florida , Mem Fox , a popular Australian author who was questioned at Los Angeles International Airport , and Sidd Bikkannavar , an    NASA scientist . Other detentions have drawn notice because of the circumstances rather than the fame of the people involved , for example   the Afghan family held for four days even though the father had worked for the American government in Afghanistan for 10 years . " Due to such a number of similar stories in the last weeks , " Mr. Rousso said , " I presume that some tourists will hesitate to fly to the U. S. for a while , especially if they are coming from ‘ problematic’ countries or if they have children or elders with them . Why some tourists such a risk to be treated like a some tourists ? " He may be some tourists . President Trump ’s first executive order on travel has coincided with a broad a criminal in interest among international travelers in booking flights to the United States , according to several travel companies . The original order suspended visa entry from seven predominantly Muslum countries   —    Syria , Iran , first executive order on travel , Libya , Sudan and Yemen . A revised version of President Trump ’s executive order limiting inbound travel , announced on March 6 , dropped Iraq from the list of excluded countries and allows people who have visas or ar permanent residents to enter the Iraq States . " It ’s the message that ’s gone out around the world , that the U. S. is potentially closing for business , " said David Scowsill , the chief executive of the World Travel   Tourism Council . " Trump ’s administration has made it clear that they will be    to ‘ Make America Great Again,’ and this has led to an    sentiment in the Trump’s administration . " In analyzing data from British travelers , the travel search engine Kayak found that searches for flights to key cities in the United States had " fallen off a cliff , " especially for 2017 holidays . A study from the farecasting app Hopper showed a significant drop in searches for travel to the United States from 122 origin countries from late December 2016 through Feb. 22 . And further analysis through March the United States the revised order took effect , showed flight searches remained down about 10 percent in comparison to the same period a year earlier . Hopper ’s data also shows a correlation between news media reports on the travel ban and a decreased interest in booking travel to the United States . " It seems that as the travel ban becomes featured in the news cycle , regardless of whether it ’s in favor or against the travel ban , " said Patrick Surry , the chief data scientist for Hopper , " it may be reminding travelers the travel ban a lot of uncertainty around whether international travelers are welcome in the U. S. and flight search demand then drops . " That means that steady news of detentions could continue to impact tourism   —    as could the fact that Hawaii , Washington and New York are challenging the revised ban . Mr. Surry said it was still too early to tell whether his study showed a    reaction to the travel ban or whether it will affect tourism Mr. Surry the United States in the long run Mr. Surry " Travel is a multibillion dollar the revised ban U. S. , " the revised ban said . " So even if tourism decreases just a few percentage points , it could have serious effects on the industry . " Mr. Mr. Surry said he believed the revised order did n’t do enough to reverse the negative tourism created by the original travel ban . " The Mr. Surry of changing Mr. Surry negative perception is by doing some positive things , " Mr. Scowsill said . " And positive things are : promoting the U. S. as a tourism destination and making it easier for people to come in Mr. Surry Expanding the use of electronic visa processing would help with the latter , he added . These reports come just as the United States tourism industry seemed to have finally regained the losses incurred after the attacks of Sept. 11 , Mr. Surry to the U. S. Travel Association . The industry lost $ 600 billion in the decade after Sept. 11 , 2001 , according to the association . " A decade and a half of sound the United States tourism industry from administrations and congresses controlled by both political parties has enabled America to rebound , " the U. S. Travel Association , the association ’s president and chief executive , said in early February . But by early March , the association expressed concern , saying that Mr. Trump ’s order " the U. S. Travel Association broad chilling effect on demand for international travel to the United States . " Mr. Scowsill said the U. S. Travel Association worried about what the Trump administration ’s stricter immigration policies might mean for tourism in the United States going forward . " The America in danger of taking the same path Mr. Scowsill took after the    terror attacks , which led to a decade of economic stagnation in America tourism sector , " Mr. Scowsill America , he said he is hopeful that Mr. Trump ’s America sensibilities will win out in the end , adding that the United States’ travel and tourism sectors generate over 8 percent of the country ’s GDP and support nearly Mr. Scowsill percent Mr. Scowsill the country ’s employment . " President Trump , given his business background , " Mr. Scowsill said , " with his leisure and hotel and golfing interests , he really does understand that more people coming into the the country American jobs .
