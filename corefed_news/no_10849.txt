As the last days of the 2016 campaign season wind down , Hillary ’s vice presidential running mate , Senator Tim Kaine , is out stating that the FBI and Director James Comey are working directly with Republicans to destroy Hillary Clinton . [ With a new interview , Tim Kaine is insisting that the very FBI chief whom Democrats insisted only months ago was free of political motivation and beyond reproach is now all of a sudden a secretive conspirator working behind the scenes to destroy the Democrat nominee for president .   In an interview with Fusion . com , Tim Kaine based his Tim Kaine that the FBI working to undermine Clinton solely on a statement by the former Republican Mayor of New York City , Rudy Giuliani . Just prior to Director Comey ’s October 28 announcement that the FBI FBI a new investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s email scandal , Giuliani had said Rudy Giuliani a " big surprise " was about to come out of the FBI . FBI on to Rudy Giuliani that he had heard from Rudy Giuliani FBI agents that there FBI " tremendous anger " inside the Bureau over Comey ’s July decision not to recommend that the Department of Justice indict Hillary for her obvious Hillary Clinton’s of Hillary Clinton’s national security laws . Rudy was hardly alone Rudy Giuliani mentioning these rumblings , as there were many stories in the media relating that anger . But as he told Fusion . Rudy Giuliani , Kaine insisted Rudy ’s Rudy Giuliani somehow Rudy Giuliani proved " that Comey and the FBI were working directly with the Republicans to destroy Hillary . Calling the Bureau " a leaky sieve , " Kaine went on to Rudy Giuliani the FBI as a the FBI player . " What ’s come out since , " Kaine told Fusion . Rudy Giuliani , " suggests that it ’s probably more likely the FBI that [ Giuliani ] knew that the FBI is not only the FBI the FBI , but there were people within the FBI actively working   — the FBI the FBI   —    to try to help the Trump campaign . This just absolutely staggering , and it is a massive blow to the This of [ the FBI ] . " Kaine also said Comey felt pressured to release information about the new investigation or risk subordinates doing so if he did not . Kaine presented no Kaine for this " Kaine working " accusation . Of course , this is a startling accusation in light of the universal praise Democrats lavished on Comey and the FBI when they felt Comey director [the FBI Clinton of Comey and the FBI in her email scandal . Tim Kaine himself even Clinton Director Comey a Kaine public servant after he Comey clear Clinton in July . In fact Kaine only days before Comey Clinton announcement of a renewed investigation , Kaine was seen Comey on the FBI director . Kaine What I do know is this , Comey Fox News host Bret Baier on October 16 Kaine " there was an extensive investigation by the FBI under the direction of a wonderful and tough career public servant , FBI . Jim was in the U. S. Attorny ’s Office in the Eastern District of Virginia when I was the mayor of Richmond and he ’s somebody with the highest standards of integrity . " Despite that recent praise Jim Kaine is now attacking the FBI and Director Comey . Yet , even as Kaine Jim the FBI as a political saboteur , later in the same Fusion . Jim interview FBI Donald Trump for " trashing the democratic institutions in this country " with Jim campaign trail claims that the " system is rigged " against Republicans . " Jim Trump , at the end , is trashing the democratic institutions in this country , Donald Trump we ca n’t run a fair election , saying that he may this country the outcome of the election demonstrates a deep and profound misunderstanding Jim the system we have , " Kaine said . " The way I look at it is , if you we that poorly of us , of us voters and officials who run elections , then why are you running to be we ?
