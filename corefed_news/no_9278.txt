On the Fox News Channel ’s " Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo , " former Speaker Newt Gingrich said Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) must win " virtually all the delegates " in the upcoming Indiana primary to have a chance at securing the GOP nomination .   former Speaker Newt Gingrich said , " Indiana is make or break for Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz , and Indiana ’s a bump in the road for Trump . If Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ca n’t win Indiana , and by win I mean , get virtually all the delegates , do something like close to what former Speaker Newt Gingrich did in Wisconsin , there ’s no possibility that former Speaker Newt Gingrich can stop Trump . It ’ll just be over sometime Wednesday morning . On the other hand , if Trump does n’t do particularly well in Indiana , Trump has so much overall momentum , and Trump ’s such a huge lead that Trump could still win by winning in New Jersey and California on June 7 . So , for Trump it is a significant event . For Cruz , it ’s life and death . " Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
