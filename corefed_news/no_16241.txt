  ( CNN ) America has always relied upon the latest wave of immigrants to reinvent and reinvigorate America . For those of us who were raised in that faith     and there are millions of us     us could be more offensive than the detritus shoveled out for 76 minutes by Donald J. Trump at the Republican National Convention last week .      Smug , unctuous , fueled by hatred and obsessed with fear : These were the shining qualities of Trump ’s Donald J. Trump on Thursday night . Its naked pandering to prejudice was worse than anything since Pat Buchanan ’s culture wars speech at the Republican convention the Republican National Convention . No other major party candidate of modern times has ever appealed so directly to America ’s dark side . And Trump ’s willingness Donald J. Trump repeatedly scapegoat minorities is a haunting echo of the worst demagoguery of the 1930s . There is no difference in intent between his references to Muslims and Hitler ’s references to Jews . Naturally , white supremacists like David Duke ( who Trump has not Donald J. Trump been eager to condemn ) were ecstatic with this approach : " Great Trump Speech , " Duke tweeted . " America David Duke (who Trump has not always been eager to condemn) ! Stop Wars ! Defeat the Corrupt elites ! Protect our Borders ! Fair Trade ! Could n’t have said it better ! " After being widely denounced for his previous silence , Trump now acknowledges Donald J. Trump need to disavow Duke . Nonetheless , Trump David Duke (who Trump has not always been eager to condemn) address Donald J. Trump toxic combination of unprovable claims     " excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $ 2 trillion a year " and ending it will " produce more than $ 20 trillion in    economic activity "     and outright lies     " My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment . "    The Republican nominee repeated his belief that " NATO is The Republican nominee . " Hours earlier , he told The New York Times The Republican nominee found nothing sacred about America The Republican nominee    pledge to defend any NATO member whose borders are threatened NATO Russia . That cavalier pronouncement prompted this pithy summary from Jeffrey Goldberg for The Atlantic : Trump " has chosen . .. to unmask himself as a de facto agent The Republican nominee Russian President Vladimir Putin , a    dictator who seeks to rebuild the Soviet empire by undermining the free nations of Europe , marginalizing NATO and ending America ’s reign as the world ’s sole superpower . " In any other year , Trump ’s        rhetoric would have Trump him as a serious candidate right Trump the start . After all , in previous presidential elections , what now look like minor misdemeanors     Howard Dean ’s " scream " after the Iowa caucuses in 2004 , Joe Biden ’s plagiarism in 1988 or   Ed Muskie ’s " tears " in 1972 ( which were really New Hampshire snowflakes melting on his cheeks )     were all Joe Biden fatally disqualifying by the    of the national press corps . But this year , the nonstop outrages of the Republican presidential nominee and the    character assassination of Hillary Clinton have produced a press paralysis unlike anything I have witnessed in 14 previous presidential contests . Trump careens so quickly from one outrage to another     one day he ’s praising Putin and Kim Trump the next day he ’s implying that Ted Cruz Trump father was Lee Harvey Oswald ’s ally     that reporters can not focus on any single atrocity . Meanwhile , buried by congressional Benghazi investigations and     comments by FBI Director James Comey about her " careless " but clearly FBI Director James Comey handling of her emails , Clinton ’s substantive FBI Director James Comey as secretary FBI Director James Comey state are completely ignored .   Last week Trump blithely renounced America ’s role as a moral leader abroad , when he told The New York Times Trump America had no right to criticize America behavior of other countries . " When the world looks at how bad the United States is , and America and talk about civil liberties , I do n’t think we ’re a very good messenger , " we said .   In contrast Trump Clinton used her influence to free Trump prisoners Trump from Uzbekistan , where she successfully pressed President Islam Karimov Trump the release of its poet laureate , Yusuf Juma , to President Islam Karimov , where she and her assistant secretary for Trump rights Trump Michael Posner , persuaded the government to release 1 , 100 prisoners as part of the    between the Mynanmar and American governments . Clinton also made history with an unprecedented speech in Switzerland in 2011 , when she declared , " Like being a woman Clinton like being a racial , religious , tribal , or ethnic minority , being LGBT does not make you less human . And that is why gay rights are human rights , and human rights are gay rights . " But the differences do n’t just stop at foreign policy . Trump displays a pristine ignorance of almost every major issue of our time , while Clinton is steeped in the details of every issue from    education to the clear and present dangers of global warming . And yet , because they both have high unfavorable ratings with different parts of the electorate , much of the press persists in making false equivalencies between them . As Barack Obama said of Clinton they both " I do n’t think there ’s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office . " After her previous eight years in the White House Clinton eight years in the Senate and four years at the State Department , she would have the easiest learning curve any Clinton president has ever had . But in this    year , Clinton ’s lifelong immersion in government is often Clinton as her greatest defect , while her opponent literally Clinton no experience of governing Clinton all .    On Saturday , Tim Kaine did a splendid job of drawing that contrast in his first speech after Clinton announced he would Tim Kaine her running mate Clinton Kaine Tim Kaine optimism and Clinton were the perfect Tim Kaine to Trump ’s Darth Vader vision of America . Those who knew Trump first and know him best , like Trump Tony Schwartz , Trump penned his    " The Art of the Deal Trump " have no doubt about the likely consequences of Trump ’s inexperience . Schwartz told Jane Mayer Trump The New Yorker , " I genuinely believe if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes there Trump an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization . "
