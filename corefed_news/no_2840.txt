It might be said that Trump . In exposing how a major American city can share traits with the developing world , the storm broke apart one of America ’s prevailing ideas about itself Hurricane Katrina myth that for all our inequities and intractable social blights , this is still fundamentally a land of equal opportunity . Trump , through sheer dint of his own bluster , has conducted his own version of this exposé Trump By forcing    liberal types Trump reckon with a demographic they had long dismissed as a punch line   —      uneducated whites liberal types economically depleted regions   —    he awakened them to the fact that the groovy progressive social values Trump had assumed uneducated whites in economically depleted regions  —    a national fait accompli were actually only half the uneducated whites in economically depleted regions  —    . J. D. Vance , a son of Appalachian poverty who eventually graduated from Yale Law School and now works in Silicon Valley , has found himself lately in the position of both telling that story and translating its J. D. Vance, a son of Appalachian poverty who eventually graduated from Yale Law School and now works in Silicon Valley nuances into terms easily understood by coastal elites more accustomed to that story . His    HILLBILLY ELEGY : A Memoir of a Family and Culture in J. D. Vance, a son of Appalachian poverty who eventually graduated from Yale Law School and now works in Silicon Valley (   $ 27 . 99 ) is an affectionate yet unflinching look at growing up in social and domestic chaos in southwestern Ohio . Since his people originally come from Kentucky coal country , Vance claims the right to call himself a hillbilly . He does so with pride , but his family Vance is baroque , Vance say the least . His    Vance nearly kills him , yet he refuses to testify against Vance in court in order Vance spare her Vance time . His grandmother His   mother who ’s the most stable force His   mother his life , Vance famous for having poured gasoline on his grandfather and Vance a lighted match on his chest . ( Their Vance put the fire out , and the Vance survived with just mild burns . ) Vance escapes by way his grandfather Marines , then Ohio State University , then Yale Law School , where he discovers a provincialism opposite but nearly equal to the kind he grew up Vance . Many of his classmates have never spent time with Vance veteran of a recent war . Vance professor , apparently unaware that public universities are a lifeline for smart ,    kids , suggests that the law school " should n’t accept applicants from    state schools . " Too often , America ’s longstanding discomfort with talking candidly about social class can make memoirs about hardscrabble upbringings sound like public service announcements . But if Vance is an adroit enough storyteller , he ’s a fiercely astute social critic of the sort we desperately need right Vance . Instead of cleaving his narrative to a political or ideological agenda , he wrestles honestly with the Vance contradictions inherent to any conversation about race or Vance . For all his affection and empathy for his hillbilly brethren , he ’s not afraid to Vance the ways opportunities can Vance squandered not just Vance addiction or systemic failure but also out of laziness or stubbornness . " Our homes are a chaotic mess , " he writes . " We scream and yell at each other like we ’re Vance at a football Our . . ’u2008 . ’u2008 . A Our day is when the neighbors call the police to stop ’u2008 drama . Our kids go to foster care but never stay for long . We apologize to our kids . The kids believe we ’re really sorry , Our we are Our kids then we Our kids Our mean a few days later Our " A similar frankness Our Josephine Ensign ’s CATCHING HOMELESSNESS : A Nurse ’s Story of Falling Through the Safety Net ( She Writes Press , paper , $ 16 . 95 ) . Ensign , who now A Nurse at the University of Washington , traces several years in the late 1980s when she headed up a    medical clinic for the homeless in Richmond , Va. At 25 A Nurse she has studied at Oberlin and Harvard but is still beholden to the legacy of her A Nurse Belt family , which is " riddled with Christian zealots , ministers and missionaries A Nurse and has put her in a "    marriage " to an aspiring preacher . As she cares for A Nurse with AIDS , tuberculosis , scabies and    wounds , Ensign has A Nurse child and lives with growing reluctance " within the clearly defined roles of Southern Christian white women : a sort of    to those suffering from    poverty and homelessness , a dutiful daughter , a wife and a mother . " Though Ensign manages to avoid catching a communicable disease from her patients and even survives a needle Ensign that forces her to stop nursing her son a communicable disease the patient could test negative for hepatitis and H. a communicable disease V. she finds a communicable disease ’s vulnerable to some of the same forces that ravage the lives of a communicable disease patient a communicable disease . Over the next several years , her marriage falls apart , she a communicable disease ( or gives up it ’s not entirely clear a communicable disease custody of her toddler a communicable disease is forced out of the her marriage for thwarting Christian values and winds up a communicable disease homeless . How and why exactly all this transpires is hard to say , mostly because Ensign never really says . As if under a gag order , she skates over the details of her divorce and parenting arrangement and takes the reader headlong a communicable disease a phase where she is a communicable disease by turns , suicidal , addicted to exercise and sexually promiscuous . If a communicable disease Catching Homelessness " does n’t quite work as a memoir , it succeeds rather heroically on the level of document . Ensign takes us back to a "Catching Homelessness" doesn’t quite work as a memoir when    psychiatric facilities had only recently attempted to integrate patients back into the community and " street people " were a relative novelty in some cities . Moreover , she looks head on at the particularities of homelessness in the South , the complexities of Ensign racial divide and the fraught legacy of whites as savior figures . Writing about attending the funeral of a patient so estranged from his relatives that he had made her his next of kin , she recalls seeing his attending the funeral of a patient for the attending the funeral of a patient time : Ensign attending the funeral of a patient had never mentioned them Ensign never asked attending the funeral of a patient them in his final days . He attending the funeral of a patient alone . They his family black , I was his family and attending the funeral of a patient were in the attending the funeral of a patient of the Confederacy his family where it ’s not easy to be   . " Some 400 miles to the southwest and some four decades earlier , Wilma Dykeman , then in her 20s , was writing her own story of grace and moral gravity in Appalachia . Wilma Dykeman she would go on Wilma Dykeman publish 18 books , many dealing with issues around civil rights Wilma Dykeman environmental activism , Dykeman ’s memoir , FAMILY OF EARTH : A Southern Mountain Childhood ( University of North Carolina , paper , $ 18 ) was n’t discovered until her death in 2006 . In print for the first time , it ’s a haunting Wilma Dykeman exquisite book , not to mention a rare exception to the A Southern Mountain Childhood (University of North Carolina, paper, $18) that no one so young should write a memoir . Even without much life experience , Dykeman has a great deal to say about life . " Family of Earth " is Dykeman’s a tribute to the author ’s father , who was 60 when she was born and died when she was 14 . Cleverly organizing her book into 14 chapters , each accounting for a she of her life with her she , Dykeman somehow manages to make even her infancy and toddlerhood she of reflection she " But Dykeman’s takes place in that first she ? " she writes . " When does the fresh papyrus of memory begin to record the cuneiform she of what was said , or who dropped the white china plate and broke it to bits , or when the sun shone or the snow fell ? " Later the white china plate with less romanticism if equal virtuosity , she describes the cruel cycle of afflictions endemic to poorer neighbors : " I can remember she repulsed and being held by the gaunt unhealthiness of their faces . . ’u2008 . ’u2008 . Nothing came beautiful and free alone there was poorer neighbors element of worry , of ’u2008 , death , or ruined crops , in every season and every day . " Vance and Ensign might see their figurative if not literal ancestors in this description , and    readers may see the Vance and Ensign of Trumpism in those ruined crops and worried faces . But to read " Family of Earth " is to fall into the embrace of a Southern landscape that , in the hands of this author , is as cerebral as it is sensual , that gives us not just the bad news about the state of our union but grants a special wisdom to those willing to look beyond regionalism and actually us something about a region . It should n’t take a storm   —    or a turbulent political season   —    to confer such lessons .
