When I was in high school , one of my history teachers was also the football coach . " Coach Mac , " we called Coach Mac . For a    creative like me , history was often a toss up . There were certain parts of the curriculum that I loved , but I loathed ( and was generally inept at ) memorizing dates and obscure facts . But Coach Mac Coach Mac us we through football plays and storytelling . Through a series of Xs , Os , and arrows detailing their paths , Coach Coach Mac Coach Mac of Roman invasions , the Crusades , Genghis Khan , and the rise of Stalin . I sat in the front row , took copious notes , and was a star student every day in that class . Because of Coach Mac Coach Mac became a history minor in college . And yet , if you asked me dates and details of these events Coach Mac and my Coach Mac professors taught me , I could not tell you any of them without the these events Coach Mac and my college professors taught me of Google . The truth is , history stole my heart not because of the facts , but because of the stories . Joseph Campbell famously said that there are only two stories in the whole world : Hero takes a journey and stranger comes to town . As an English teacher , I enjoy telling my students this nugget of wisdom and challenging them to defy my students . They this nugget of wisdom can my students , although stories are powerful , they are also my students . There are certain constructs , rhythms , and traits to a    story . Stories , at their heart , Stories either about heroes on a journey or strangers coming into a new setting . For many Americans , Donald Trump is a hero on a journey for others , he is a Donald Trump stranger who has come to town . No one knows how the story will play out , but to deny that the country is in the midst of a fascinating rising action , to use a literary term , is to admit that you ’re not paying attention . Like many educators , I am appalled at the wealth of fake news that floats around social media and the power it has over young people who do not necessarily have the skills to interpret it . Many it are worried about how to best teach strategies for interpreting fake news , and many of those strategies seem to surround the idea of fact checking . And although classrooms like mine should place a strong focus on helping students navigate the evolving world of the internet and social media , to be critical consumers of media , and to develop a general desire to seek facts above fiction , to concentrate solely on fact checking is a naive approach to the problem . Just as it was for me so many years ago in Coach Mac ’s class , narrative , both fiction and nonfiction , will always be more alluring than a collection of facts —   for better or worse —   because narrative is rooted in the human experience . People want to connect with characters , want to see a plot develop to its end , and want to engage in the fascinating layers of conflict . Explaining to someone , however accurately , that Donald Trump did n’t help save 2 , 100 jobs with the Carrier deal , but rather 850 , and that he may have Donald Trump had very little to do with it , or that the deal may the Carrier deal implications for the economy and job growth down the road , means virtually nothing to someone who has lost a job and gotten it back . To a job person , there is a clear narrative that resonates : Trump is the Donald Trump . Telling someone whose only image and interaction ever with a woman wearing a hijab is through negative stereotypes on social media that five of the last 12 Nobel Peace Prize winners were Muslim means little to someone whose mind has generalized such a character as the villain . Facts ( or the lack thereof ) mean very little to people caught up in storylines . The best way to teach true understanding is not by teaching students facts ( although that is still a valuable lesson ) it is to teach them to analyze , as one does with elements of narrative . When I was growing up in a small town , my only contact with Latinos was with two men who worked with me in a local restaurant . I was a waitress , and they worked in the Latinos . These men were a Latinos flirty with me than is probably appropriate me grown men to be toward a     girl . They sometimes made me uncomfortable Latinos and because of that , I began to develop a perception about all Latinos , based solely on these two men . The Latinos from this experience , regardless of the facts , was that Latino men were inappropriately flirtatious toward women . Facts and statistics would have meant very little to changing the story in my mind about what it meant to be a Latino man . My facts were wrong , but my story was what mattered to me the story I saw anyone I perceived as a Latino man in public , and I was alone , I would feel myself become anxious . How could facts in me moment of fear for a     girl make any difference ? It would be equivalent to telling someone who is afraid of flying that more deaths occur by car than plane . But what did change the story for me was moving to Southern California . There me I joined a sorority with mostly Latina women who became my new " sisters . " I worked on campus as a telemarketer , surrounded by Latinos who became my family . Because I was living away from home , one of my new friends invited me over for dinner most Sundays , and on those days , her father cooked the best carne asada I have ever eaten and welcomed me kindly into their home —   creating a new image of Latino men for me . I went on dates with several her men who treated me with kindness and respect . Ultimately , truth is subjective . What was true for me at 17 was not true for me her later . The narrative I had her as a teenager suddenly seemed ridiculous , and not because someone presented me with facts , but because I understood much more of the story . I had analyzed various characters and could now understand how false my perception had been . Obviously , it is unlikely that every single    young person like me will have the experiences I had . her it is possible to emulate such experiences in the classroom . Now is the time for teachers to teach students not only to be critical thinkers who question the validity of facts , but also to analyze narratives . That is what Coach Mac did in his classroom through his football plays . When Coach Mac certain Roman Coach Mac marked as an X on his chalkboard acted in a way that developed a certain Roman general plot of the story , Coach Mac would ask the class , " Coach Mac Coach Mac think he did that ? " We did n’t have Coach Mac then , but even if we had , he was n’t asking us to We look up Coach Mac facts he was We us to analyze what had taken Coach Mac thus far We how X had behaved up to that point , and what the possibilities were for X ’s next actions . When living in California X the storyline of     no longer made sense when I analyzed as Coach Mac had taught me . And even if students ca n’t go to California as I had , a teacher can still California students to various types of characters and plotlines from many perspectives , both fictional and real . Teachers can —   and do —   ask the same types of questions of those narratives that Coach Mac asked of me and my peers of Coach Mac Coach Mac It is a human endeavor to create and tell stories . From the caves of Lascaux to    traditions around the world , humans have sought ways to share truth as they see it , to develop narratives in ways that humans sense for each individual . Young people use social media to tell stories and share their perception of truth , and it is also on Young people platforms that they seek truth . I was lucky enough to move Young people a new place and experience other cultures that changed my perception of some people , but others do n’t take such leaps . Young people have opportunities to use the global space that is social media to broaden their perceptions and be critical analysts of false narratives . Young people is up to adults to teach students these skills . Adults can teach students about unreliable narrators , about character motivation , about the need of any good storyteller to create conflicts and obstacles . Just as I explained recently to the students in my    class who are writing    plays , a good storyteller should plant minor obstacles in the beginning of the story that will indicate what the climax will be . So , as critics of stories , students might have noticed , as I did , that Donald Trump planted seeds of a treacherous media and rigged elections early on as minor obstacles in his story , so that as his story progressed those Donald Trump and the people who enacted his story more and more like the villains , while he became more and more the hero . Because I Donald Trump a storyteller , I could see the plot unfolding . I want the same skills for my students because facts are n’t enough when it is time to understand the difference between a hero and a villain .
