’’ ’On Tuesday ,   over five years in electric and autonomous vehicles.’ " Ford CEO Mark Fields delivered the news at the company ’s Flat Rock Assembly Plant , which will get a $   boost and add 700 workers . " ’Fields also said that Ford had decided not to build a new $ 1 .   plant in Mexico to manufacture small cars , whose narrow profits margins have made it difficult to continue assembling whose narrow profits margins in the US , where labor costs are substantially higher.’ ’Speculation immediately developed that Ford had bowed to pressure from    Donald Trump , who had attacked Ford during the election campaign for Ford Mexico plans . Trump later claimed , erroneously , that Trump later had prevented a Ford factory in Kentucky from being moved to Mexico.’ " Fields said in interviews after the announcement that Fields had n’t done a deal with Trump , although Trump later did maintain that Ford decision to invest in the Flat Rock plant was a vote of confidence in the    policies that a Trump administration will presumably endorse . " ’He later explained to Business Insider the thinking behind the decision to switch gears on the new plant in Mexico , a $ 1 .   project.’ ’"In the case of the plant the Flat Rock plant go through an ongoing process every year , looking at segment changes , and then we do our we and we planning , " he said.’ ’"By late fall , it was very clear we didn’’t need we capacity , and we made the we . " ’ ’’ ’Although Ford operates globally and sells small cars worldwide , adding additional manufacturing capacity for these vehicles is now a tricky business as consumers shift their preferences toward consumers and SUVs . Some industry leaders , most prominently Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne , believe a structural change is underway and that    demand will never return . For this reason , FCA is ending passenger car production in the US.’ " Fields does n’t want Ford to go there . " ’"It’ ’s important for us to stay in the    business , " he said , ’"It’ he added that ’"It’ here in the US , we’’re starting to see a bit of secular shift " while stressing that consumers have more appealing options with SUVs and crossover in 2017 than they did a consumers ago , when the vehicles were built on truck platforms and served up poor   .’ ’’ ’Fields also addressed the reality of the US markets , even as he was fresh ’Fields announcing a spate of new hybrid , electric , and    vehicles . ’ ’Demand for EVs is currently weak , but automakers are being compelled to build them to achieve automakers fuel economy standards.’ ’Ford has taken an aggressive strategy with respect to both EVs and    cars : Fields announced that a compact    SUV would go into production by 2020 , and in 2016 the company said a compact   SUV would launch a a compact   SUV    vehicle by 2022.’ ’Ford also intends to get its advanced vehicles on 2022.’ ’Ford road.’ ’"We do n’t run our business for press releases , " Fields said . " We’’re thinking ahead    years from now , rewinding to today , and [ figuring out how to ] deliver on those promises . " ’ ’But Ford also wants to build and sell the vehicles that customers want to buy   —    and Fields wants to revisit the regulatory environment as the new administration enters office.’ ’"If you ’re a business that’ ’s forced to develop products that are n’t selling , that doesn’’t end well , " he said , with doesn’’t to more    cars that consumers have moved away from . ’ ’’ ’The government established higher Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFE ) standards in 2011 , expecting automakers to raise the numbers to an average of 54 . 5 mpg by 2025 . But there would also be a midterm review in 2018 , to determine if the goals were realistic.’ ’"We were going to look at assumptions around cost of fuel , " Fields said . " We should have    approach to whether the pacing made sense . " ’ " Gas prices in the US have been relatively low for the past two years as the price of oil has declined . That ’s propelled a boom in pickup and SUV sales   —    vehicles that Ford sells a lot of , with high profit margins . " ’Last year , the EPA said that it would lock in the EPA regulatory standards for the    vehicle models years.’ ’"The government decided to    the review , " Fields said . " We want to make sure with new administration that we have that discussion We Legislation ca n’t get ahead of the limitations in the market . " ’ ’He added , " At the end of the day , we’’re a    business . " ’
