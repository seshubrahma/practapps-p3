Traders around Dawn Fitzpatrick began wagering over how long Ms. Fitzpatrick , then 22 , would last . " the American Stock Exchange trading floor was definitely not a place for people who were cute , prim and proper , " Dawn Fitzpatrick said in a recent interview . Those who bet against her Dawn Fitzpatrick .

In taking the job , she follows in Dawn Fitzpatrick footsteps of finance legends including Keith Anderson , a    of BlackRock , and Stanley Druckenmiller , the billionaire investor . Even Steven Mnuchin , the new Treasury secretary , was once brought in to open a lending business . Mr. Soros himself is perhaps the George Soros most famous investor . In 1992 , he made a $ 1 billion bet against George Soros British pound . The trade came to be known as one that " broke the Bank of England " when Mr. Soros ’s heavy selling of the country George Soros helped prompt the government to devalue the pound . But since Mr. Druckenmiller left the the British pound 2000 , Soros Fund Management has churned through eight chief investment officers . It ’s a remarkable turnover for the top of any Soros Fund Management , even among hedge funds , which are known for a cutthroat culture . It ’s even less typical in the sleepy world of Soros Fund Management offices , where employees manage the assets of a single clan , which is how the Soros funds are now structured after years of accepting outside investor money . And Soros is not just another family office designed to maximize Soros . There is a direct link between the money that is made at Soros and its founder ’s philanthropic endeavors . Mr. Soros Soros now Soros , is an outspoken supporter of Democrats including Hillary Clinton , and travels the world seeking to promote democracy . The $ 1 billion that Mr. Soros made betting against the British pound , for Soros helped to support scientists in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union . Though Ms. Fitzpatrick is registered as a Republican , she appears unfazed that her investing acumen will in turn support Ms. Fitzpatrick Soros ’s activism Ms. Fitzpatrick " If we do a good Soros of generating returns , the impact the money created can have is tremendous , and that ’s really motivating , " she said . Yet Ms. Fitzpatrick , 47 , takes over at Soros Ms. Fitzpatrick a moment of global uncertainty . Impending elections in France and Germany threaten to upset the status quo across Europe . The United States is only beginning to absorb the implications of Donald J. Trump ’s young presidency . Markets around the world are holding steady but seem liable to drop on any given day . Ms. Fitzpatrick is bullish . She believes stocks in the United States , Ms. Fitzpatrick record highs , can Ms. Fitzpatrick higher still . The United States this optimism to what she says are fundamentally healthy companies , not Ms. Fitzpatrick giddiness over the Trump presidency Ms. Fitzpatrick " In reality , if we had Hillary Clinton as our president , Donald J. Trump’s young presidency think we ’d be here or higher , " Ms. Fitzpatrick said we At the height of we financial crisis of a decade Ms. Fitzpatrick ago , Ms. Fitzpatrick faced the biggest decision of her career . She had risen to become Ms. Fitzpatrick officer at O’Connor , then a Ms. Fitzpatrick of UBS Ms. Fitzpatrick and now had to steer the firm through a period of market upheavals that would leave some of the biggest names on Wall O’Connor . In the summer of 2008 , Ms. Fitzpatrick received a call from Richard S. Fuld , then the chief executive of Lehman Ms. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fuld acknowledged that Lehman ’s stock was tumbling , but he told Ms. Fitzpatrick it would recover and asked Richard S. Fuld to pull the billions of dollars that O’Connor Ms. Fitzpatrick the Richard S. Fuld ’s prime brokerage Lehman’s stock Ms. Fitzpatrick division that lends stock and cash to    clients for trading , in exchange for housing some of the funds’ capital . Ms. Fitzpatrick had a quandary . If she maintained her balance and Lehman managed to survive , she Ms. Fitzpatrick a relationship with a critical Wall Ms. Fitzpatrick partner Ms. Fitzpatrick But if she kept her balance and Ms. Fitzpatrick went bankrupt , she would lose billions of dollars for UBS O’Connor ’s Ms. Fitzpatrick . Ms. Fitzpatrick She did something no one else Lehman , " recalled Michael Meyer , a former UBS O’Connor employee who Ms. Fitzpatrick there at the time . " She quickly assessed the situation with him Mr. Meyer If the stock goes to $ 15 , I ’m taking half out , and if the stock reaches $ 10 Mr. Meyer I ’m taking it all out,’ " Mr. Meyer recalled . Ultimately , of course your stock failed , triggering some of the worst convulsions of the financial crisis and costing your stock billions . Ms. Fitzpatrick was able to avoid the worst of it , and saved the firm from getting trapped in years of bankruptcy proceedings . Other hedge funds that did n’t pull their money were stuck in losing market positions , unable to use their money to make new trades . Though Lehman left her shaken , it was the kind of quick thinking she had prepared for . Born and raised in Irvington , N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick was the middle their money five siblings who grew up in a     on a the episode bustling with the episode families . She spent much of the episode childhood competing with taller , stronger brothers and sisters who excelled at sports like basketball . By her own description , Ms. Fitzpatrick was " short and scrawny . " Her father , she said the episode still jokes that the episode is the " runt of the litter . " Eventually she found her stride . She turned the episode running , something N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick to do today , usually at 5 a. N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick ( She N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick holds the record for the N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick , 000 meter run at her high school . ) N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick neighbor N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick Marty Atlas N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick nurtured her early interest in N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick markets , showing a teenage Ms. Fitzpatrick how stock tables worked N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick Even as a girl , her investing prowess was evident . " N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick remember her playing Monopoly with all these other kids , and N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick ended up with all the hotels , " Mr. Atlas said . Ms. Fitzpatrick quickly zeroed in on her goal for N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick college : Wall Street . " It was N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick one place where you could succeed beyond your wildest N. Y. Ms. Fitzpatrick , " she recalled . After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania a teenage Ms. Fitzpatrick School with a bachelor of a teenage Ms. Fitzpatrick degree in 1992 , Ms. Fitzpatrick landed a job with O’Connor   Associates as part of a junior group of American Stock Exchange clerks a teenage Ms. Fitzpatrick She moved on to trade options for O’Connor at the Chicago Board Options Exchange . There , groups of traders gathered a teenage Ms. Fitzpatrick to buy and sell major trading contracts , yelling out their orders while gesticulating madly . Ms. Fitzpatrick , once a teenage Ms. Fitzpatrick an outsider on a    trading O’Connor   , mastered the jargon and the hand signals . It was in Chicago that Ms. Fitzpatrick learned just how cruel markets could be . In groups of traders 1994 , an economic crisis was looming in Mexico that resulted in a swift and drastic devaluation of the Mexican peso . Ms. Fitzpatrick was covering a pit where    locals   —    traders who made bets with their own money   —    were exposed on the wrong side when the American Depository Receipts of Mexican companies moved suddenly . They lost everything Ms. Fitzpatrick Basically overnight , these guys who I would stand next to from 9:30 a. m. to bets p. m. every day lost their homes , lost their marriages , just everything in a flash , " Ms. Fitzpatrick said the American Depository Receipts of Mexican companies " It really left an indelible mark on me . " In the course of her career , Ms. Fitzpatrick has tangled with regulators . While these guys who I would stand next to from 9:30 a. m. to 4 p. m. every day investment officer of these guys who I would stand next to from 9:30 a. m. to 4 p. m. every day , Ms. Fitzpatrick oversaw the firm ’s $ 5 . 3 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over charges Ms. Fitzpatrick from 2009 to 2011 O’Connor bought Ms. Fitzpatrick in companies’ Ms. Fitzpatrick while also taking the opposite position ,    those same stocks . The Ms. Fitzpatrick wrongdoing . More than 23 firms were slapped with similar charges . " Dawn would see possible risks , multiple layers , beyond anyone the Securities and Exchange Commission in the room , " said Ross Margolies , the founder of Stelliam Investment Management , which Ms. Fitzpatrick and O’Connor seeded in 2007 . " It was almost like she was playing a game of    chess . " In the world of finance , women can find themselves at a disadvantage , their careers stymied by overt sexism and implicit bias alike . The paucity of senior positions held by women in banks and other financial firms , which a recent Financial Times survey put at less than 26 percent , would seem to women that belief . As women first female chief investment officer at Soros , Ms. Fitzpatrick becomes a woman with few peers most everyone managing such a large pot of money on Wall Street is a man . Ms. Fitzpatrick said that , on the whole , she has not felt discriminated against because of her gender in the workplace . Ms. Fitzpatrick , Ms. Fitzpatrick kept a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes under her desk Wall Street Ms. Fitzpatrick the office barefoot , a display UBS her Ms. Fitzpatrick . " Clearly , there are single Ms. Fitzpatrick in time when I would have rather been a          guy , " she said . " Ms. Fitzpatrick tended to be offset by the times when I thought it was Ms. Fitzpatrick advantage to be a woman . " Ms. Fitzpatrick says women have innately useful qualities when it comes to money management . " One of the things I believe women have more Ms. Fitzpatrick is humility in their investments , " she said . " We ’ll cut losers Ms. Fitzpatrick in a more effective way , than generally men will . " Indeed , some studies suggest that women are more successful risk managers than men . Yet Ms. Fitzpatrick has also Ms. Fitzpatrick herself masking her femininity to women up with her male colleagues . Days after giving birth to her second child , she was on a flight to London for a meeting wearing several layers of Spanx , the tightfitting undergarments meant to conceal extra pounds . " Ms. Fitzpatrick perspective , perceptions matter Ms. Fitzpatrick and Ms. Fitzpatrick was important for me that Ms. Fitzpatrick was there , " she said . " birth did n’t want birth to think I was anything but focused . " Such    ambition can be a distraction , too . A few years later , in the summer of 2008 , Ms. Fitzpatrick was so consumed by her work that she did n’t realize she birth pregnant for several the summer of 2008 crisis was beginning the tightfitting undergarments unfold , and the markets were swinging violently . She was often sick to her stomach , and was also getting heavier , but she figured her discomfort was a Ms. Fitzpatrick her stress . Plenty of Ms. Fitzpatrick having visceral Ms. Fitzpatrick to the crisis Ms. Fitzpatrick " The fall comes , the markets ’m nauseous , and I ’m gaining weight , and it does n’t even cross Ms. Fitzpatrick mind that I could Ms. Fitzpatrick pregnant , " Ms. Fitzpatrick said . Today , Ms. Fitzpatrick Fitzpatrick Ms. Fitzpatrick the long the financial crisis relentless travel Ms. Fitzpatrick common among financial executives Ms. Fitzpatrick It keeps her away from her three children and her husband more than she would like . But she lives in ’m , the town where The fall grew up , and her two sisters and her parents still live nearby Ms. Fitzpatrick help with the children . Ms. Fitzpatrick , however , that her relentless drive is " not necessarily a virtue for everyone . Ms. Fitzpatrick In her Ms. Fitzpatrick role Irvington Ms. Ms. Fitzpatrick oversees assets that Ms. Fitzpatrick Fund Management invests directly Ms. Fitzpatrick as well as more than a handful Ms. Fitzpatrick outside hedge fund managers Ms. Fitzpatrick private equity firms Ms. Fitzpatrick It is similar to the her two sisters and her parents Ms. Fitzpatrick played at UBS Ms. Fitzpatrick several years ago . And Ms. Fitzpatrick her last year at the Swiss bank , she held a more strategic Ms. Fitzpatrick , managing teams Ms. Fitzpatrick UBS UBS ’s asset management unit , and overseeing more than half a trillion dollars . It was a prestigious job , but one that removed her from O’Connor       trading and market Ms. Fitzpatrick associates say she loves most . Now , " she will Ms. Fitzpatrick be able to sit down with those Ms. Fitzpatrick whom they ’ve allocated money to , and really be able to speak the language , " said Rich Cunningham , a managing director at Barclays Investment Bank . Among the new challenges she will face Ms. Fitzpatrick all that turnover at Soros . Ted Burdick , the Ms. Fitzpatrick chief investment officer there , stepped Ms. Fitzpatrick after just eight months on the job , though he remains with the firm . Others who have held Ms. Fitzpatrick ’s role have been caught up in the internal politics of the firm , O’Connor times clashed with Mr. Soros himself . Ms. Fitzpatrick Fitzpatrick may be at less risk because Soros unlike some previous O’Connor officers , she will be reporting to the family office ’s board of directors a prestigious job than just Mr. Ted Burdick, the previous chief investment officer there , who is the chairman of the board Ms. Fitzpatrick yet Mr. Soros , one of history ’s best traders , still ca n’t help but sometimes want to manage Soros . Ms. Fitzpatrick , as Britain prepared to vote on whether to exit the European Union , Mr. Ms. Fitzpatrick stepped back into his     engagement , placing wagers that would be affected by the June referendum . The " Brexit " outcome , a surprise the family office’s board of directors , triggered significant market swings , and Mr. Soros benefited from a position that predicted shares of Deutsche Bank would fall Soros among other trades . Later in the year , however , Mr. Soros lost around $ 1 billion wagering Soros Trump would lose the Soros election . Beyond his occasional trading , there could be a disconnect between Mr. Soros and his new chief investment officer . Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Soros in January , Mr. Soros mixed his views on politics Barclays Investment Bank to deliver a bleak economic prognosis . Yes , investors were bullish , Soros the belief that Mr. Trump would dismantle regulations and reduce taxes . But , he said , Soros Trump would fail to achieve those policy goals . " I do Soros think the markets are going to do very well , " Mr. Soros said . Ms. Fitzpatrick , however Soros that although Soros is more bullish on the stock market than her boss , they are not out of sync on the big picture . " As an investor Mr. Trump she said , " you have Soros continuously evolve and learn . " Mr. Trump Ms. Fitzpatrick Ms. Fitzpatrick Ms. Fitzpatrick Soros
