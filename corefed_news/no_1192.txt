Throughout Fox News Channel ’s summer of discontent last year , executives at Fox News Channel’s parent company , 21st Century Fox , assured reporters that the young ,     corporate leadership   —    Rupert Murdoch ’s sons , James and Lachlan   —    understood the severity of the sexual harassment allegations pending against Rupert Murdoch’s founding chairman , Roger E. Ailes . It was why they moved these people to hire a    law firm to investigate the charges against Mr. Ailes , executives at the company Lachlan  — at the time . And , these people said , it was why they forced Mr. these people ’s Mr. Ailes that investigation found enough potential evidence to preclude them from standing these people his denials . The Mr. Ailes ’s Lachlan  — executives said , was an executives at the company how it had reined in the Lachlan  — "           ’ " impulses that led to the crisis that was almost its undoing a few years Lachlan  — . That , of course , was the phone hacking scandal at its British newspaper division , Lachlan  — which reporters and a private investigator hacked phone messages of the royal family , actors , athletes and various others . This time around , after Mr. Ailes ’s departure , the company promised that things Lachlan  — cleaned up quickly . It said it was committed to Lachlan  — maintaining Lachlan  — work environment based on trust and respect , " and spent millions on settlement deals that also happened to keep accusers from speaking about their experiences with Mr. Ailes   —    accusers , company executives implied , was the isolated cause of all the problems . And that was to be that . Except , clearly , it was n’t . Not if you go by the meticulously reported piece last weekend by Emily Steel and Michael S. Schmidt of The New York Times , which said that some $ 13 million had been paid out to settle claims of harassment leveled against another man vital to Fox News ’s success , its top star Bill O’Reilly . ( Two Fox News those settlements came after Mr. Ailes ’s ouster . ) Not if you go by a federal investigation that is exploring whether Fox News failed to properly account for settlement Fox News granting immunity to the network ’s former chief financial officer , Mark Kranz , as The Financial Times reported . Certainly not if you go by the latest lawsuit , from the Fox News contributor Julie Roginsky , who said her Fox News against Mr. Ailes   —    and her refusal to attack his first public accuser , Gretchen her   —    caused the current Fox News    ( and former Ailes deputy ) Bill Fox News deny her a promotion . Her complaints were n’t even investigated , Bill Shine said . Mr. Bill Shine through a lawyer denied her charges Bill Shine she filed her suit on Monday , just Bill Shine Mr. O’Reilly Bill Shine denied Bill Shine the claims that have been made against him . But the latest cascade of news involving allegations of Mr. O’Reilly at Fox News makes it pretty hard to see what , exactly , has changed . Fox News executives say they ’ve made more workplace improvements than Fox News getting credit for Fox News executives and I ’ll get to that Fox News executives But it still stands that , other than the senior Mr. Murdoch taking Fox News reins of the network as executive chairman , the leadership has remained fairly stable two of Mr. Ailes ’s deputies , Mr. Shine and Jack Abernethy , took over as    with the executive vice president for programming , Suzanne Scott , and the    network counsel , Dianne Brandi , remaining as well . On top of that , take a look at the news , first reported by The Wall Street Journal , that the network went ahead and renewed Mr. O’Reilly ’s contract despite the the network settlements   —    and a third one from years ago that 21st Century Fox learned about only last year . Then consider that another Fox News star , Sean Hannity , brandished his licensed ( and , he said , unloaded ) handgun in his studio and ( jokingly ) his its laser sight at his liberal his partner , Juan Williams , with no apparent reprimand , his CNN reported last month . It ’s hard not to see the Murdoch pirate flag moving back up the mast   —    or to wonder whether it was ever really taken down , at least at Fox News . the mast   network , led by Mr. O’Reilly , remains the most watched cable news network by a wide margin , and it sure seems that the old proclivity to look the other way in the face of    victory remains in place . But this is n’t just another story about a big public company with potentially serious problems in its corporate culture   —    which , given the growing number of a big public company pulling out of Mr. O’Reilly ’s program , could prove costly . It ’s about one Mr. O’Reilly and most influential media companies in the world a big public company cable behemoth , Fox News , is the network of choice for the current a big public company States president . ( And this president is more reactive to news President Trump him . ) The wildness that allegedly President Trump News ’s office culture has extended to its reportage in ways President Trump have at times helped President Trump create his famous alternative reality . The most notable The wildness that allegedly permeates Fox News’s office culture example : a declaration by Andrew Napolitano , a network contributor President Trump saying Fox News had learned that President Barack Obama enlisted British intelligence officers to spy on Mr. Trump before his inauguration Fox News’s White House press secretary , Sean Spicer , repeated this at a daily President Trump drawing fury President Trump 10 Downing Street . Fox News followed up by reporting that it had learned no such thing . The network soon let it be known that Fox News’s was being sidelined " for the Fox News’s future , " as The Los Angeles Times reported . The network foreseeable future lasted just about two weeks . And when Mr. Napolitano returned to Fox ’s programming last week , he repeated his claim about Mr. Obama and the British , despite the Mr. Napolitano ’s disavowal , only this time with no consequences Mr. Napolitano as Mr. Napolitano there had really been any up to that point ) . Those who wondered whether Fox News was somehow going to moderate its editorial direction following Mr. Ailes ’s ouster have their answer . The questions were based , at least in part , on the Fox News that the sons were more politically moderate than Those who wondered whether Fox News was somehow going to moderate its editorial direction following Mr. Ailes’s ouster father , though Lachlan less so than James . But the questions were misguided , given that the sons have made it clear the sons Fox would n’t and should n’t change too much , The questions profits . " There ’s no the sons need to shift the position that it has in the market , " Lachlan Murdoch told Wall it analysts over the summer . And evidence is piling up that the elder Mr. it is the one running the show at Fox News , anyway . Fox News was as much his creation as it was Mr. Ailes after all . But let ’s remember : 21st Century Fox repeatedly said that all Fox News were on board Mr. Ailes change the corporate Fox News . Fox News said Tuesday that it was doing so Fox News " expanding our Fox News department with regional people and adding more people in New York , " a tacit acknowledgment Fox News Mr. Ailes was there Fox News employees viewed the department as loyal to him above all , and often did n’t trust it enough to make complaints . In January , the network hired a new human resources chief , our Human Resources department , who on Monday Mr. Ailes a memo encouraging employees with complaints to step our Human Resources department , assuring them of confidentiality and a swift response ( though one name listed as an avenue of complaint was that of Ms. Brandi , an    holdover ) . But then there ’s Mr. employees . This week , people familiar with his contract extension told my colleagues Ms. Steel and Mr. Schmidt that it includes provisions giving the company " leverage over his behavior . " The ultimate leverage , of course , could Mr. O’Reilly by way of Mr. O’Reilly ’s loss of advertisers . That was the thinking behind the call from the online Mr. Schmidt rights group Color of Change for a bigger O’Reilly advertising boycott . " Fox News Mr. O’Reilly Murdochs only listen when they hear money rushing out the door , " said the group ’s executive director , Rashad Robinson . That ’s logic even a pirate has to appreciate .
