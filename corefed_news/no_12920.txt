On Monday ’s " The Herd " on Fox Sports 1 , host Colin Cowherd likened the " mess " that is the NFL ’s American Football Conference playoff teams to the GOP presidential candidates .   According to host Colin Cowherd , presidential candidates Jeb Bush , Dr. Ben Carson , Chris Christie , Mike Huckabee , Marco Rubio and Donald Trump can all be compared to AFC playoff teams Kansas Chiefs , Denver Broncos , Pittsburgh Steelers , Houston Texans , Cincinnati Bengals and the New England Patriots . He explained that the AFC favorites , whose quarterback happens to be close with Donald Trump , are Donald Trump because they the AFC favorites, whose quarterback happens to be close with Trump " issues , " but are " polarizing " and " pretty teflon . " " It ’s like when I watch all these political debates and I watch the GOP right now , Kansas City is Jeb Bush . Nice , reasonably effective , but boring , low energy . Denver is Ben Carson . About two months ago I was into it , but just too much strange for me Ben Carson Pittsburgh is Chris Christie . Fun , dynamic , but ca n’t get out of its it way . Houston is Mike Huckabee . Please , no shot . Bengals are Marco Rubio . You can see the talent , but they the talent n’t feel quite ready yet to win big . And that leaves me with the New England Patriots . I think they the talent Donald Trump . Issues , polarizing , but pretty teflon . " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
