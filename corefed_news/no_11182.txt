" [ SiriusXM host and Breitbart Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon asked Lewandowski :   One of the disturbing things we ’ve seen over the last 72 hours is something quite different , and something I do n’t believe we ’ve seen in American history , and that is : now you have the establishment of the Republican Party   —    the financiers , the consultant apparatus , the commentariat , whether it ’s Fox News or these other conservative journals   —    they ’re basically saying , " Hey , we do they care if Donald Trump runs the tables on Super Tuesday , and we do they care if he blows Donald Trump Rubio out on March 15 , we ’re they to come up   —    there ’s all kinds of presentations being made , there ’s all kinds of money being raised   —    we ’re they to take this and make it Stalingrad this We ’re they to go on March 16 all the way to the convention , fight him every step of the way and     if somehow he ’s him and we lose they Hillary Clinton because we do they have enough time to form a campaign , so be it . " What do you have to say to that ? What does Donald Trump ’s campaign have to say to the fact that you ’re just not running against other candidates , you ’re running against a whole other entity that ’s already had a    and said , " Under no circumstances will we let you win this nomination , and we do we care if we lose to the Democrats ? " Lewandowski responded : This is the fundamental problem with the ruling class in Washington , DC   —    the party bosses , the K Street crowd , the lobbyists who control all these politicians . They will all these politicians anything to maintain their power all these politicians They will all these politicians anything . They will all these politicians anything . They will all these politicians whatever it takes because they know all these politicians if Donald Trump becomes the nominee and ultimately the president of the United States , the days of backroom deals are over . He will Donald Trump be responsible to the American people . And so what you have is a series of people who ’ve made a very , very good living by controlling politicians through their donations politicians making sure they get politicians legislation done   —    or not done   —    in Washington , DC to best benefit their clients politicians And those days are coming to an end . Lewandowski said that " the Party bosses " in " the Washington , DC establishment DC are confounded " because the American people are speaking , " and " it ’s no longer the days where    …        rooms are going to dictate who ’s going to be the nominee . " He added Lewandowski " These guys think they can These guys all the money they want These guys control the nomination process . The bottom line is the people have a say , and they ’re the people out in record numbers " for Trump , who is " the only person in this race that is bringing new people into the party , who is bringing more people to show up and vote on election day .
