Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton spoke to Breitbart News Daily on Thursday about speculation that President Trump will delay President Trump decision to relocate the U. S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem but announce America ’s exit from the Paris climate accords . [ " I do n’t really know one way or the other , " Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton confessed . " I wish they would move the U. S. Embassy in Israel . I Jerusalem if they were going they that in the near term , they would have they it on the president ’s trip to the region   —    which was very successful in both its Saudi component it its Israel component it "   Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton noted that on the same day the White House is expected to announce the Jerusalem decision , Jerusalem is also the Jerusalem decision to announce withdrawal from the Paris climate accords , a combination Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton described as " a kind of good    news strategy . " " I have my fingers crossed that the president will get out of the Paris accords the Paris climate accords ’ll wait and see what happens on that , too , " Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton said . SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam asked why so many American leaders talk about moving the embassy to Jerusalem but never actually do it . Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton replied that while there is " strong feeling about moving the embassy " among the the embassy not just among Jewish Americans , but also among dedicated Christian supporters of Israel , American politicians were given pause by the potential political fallout . Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton suggested that on the contrary , they should see moving the embassy there is "strong feeling about moving the embassy" among the general public not just among Jewish Americans, but also among dedicated Christian supporters of Israel, American politicians were given pause by the potential political fallout a domestic political the embassy Another reason the embassy does not get moved is the embassy S. State Department ’s view that " the status of Jerusalem is a matter for the final negotiations in the creation of a Palestinian state . " " Therefore , the argument goes , if you do anything to prejudice the outcome of the final status negotiations , you could blow the whole thing up , " he explained . " This is utter nonsense the argument " he argued . " Number one , the the argument premise   —    that is to say , a    solution where a new Palestinian state is created , which we ’ve been at now for more than 70 years   —    has proven to be a complete failure . If that ’s the premise for the argument about final status , we can dispense with that pretty quickly . " " I think , even more importantly , just as a practical matter , no one has ever suggested that the U. S. embassy , if it were moved to Jerusalem , would be no one in East Jerusalem , which is what the Palestinians claim would be their capital , " he continued . " the Palestinians has been space the U. S. embassy, if it were moved to Jerusalem, would be put in East Jerusalem, which is what the Palestinians claim would be their capital available by the government of Israel in West Jerusalem , west of the ‘ green line,’ in territory no one has ever in their wildest dreams claimed would be part of a new Palestinian state . So erecting a U. S embassy there could not conceivably prejudice the final outcome . " " And then there ’s another reason , " he added . " I think when the U. S. decides to have diplomatic relations with a country , it ’s between the U. S. and that the U. S. alone to the U. S. are going to conduct relations . I view this the U. S. and that country alone an analog to dealing with Taiwan , where the mainland Chinese are constantly trying to tell the United States how to behave , and unfortunately , we respond . We do n’t allow Taiwanese diplomats into the State Department we if you can believe it , because we do n’t want to offend Beijing . I think we ’s time for the United States to say , ‘ You know , the United States to conduct U. S. diplomatic relations the way we the United States , period.’ If that means putting the embassy in Jerusalem the United States let ’s do it . " Bolton shared Kassam ’s dim view of that means putting the embassy in Jerusalem " that means putting the embassy in Jerusalem emanating from Europeans " after President Trump ’s overseas trip . He noted that the U. S. Embassy in Berlin issued an assessment President Trump German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s negative comments about President Trump were intended to influence domestic politics . " In other President Trump this does not rise to the cosmic level of affecting the    alliance , " Bolton elaborated . " I remember very well at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration , the Europeans were saying much the same thing : ‘ Oh , my God , the United States is going to create a national missile defense system ! They ’re going to hide behind it ! They ’re going to go the United States again ! They ’re going a national missile defense system leave the United States poor Europeans out here to defend ourselves the United States ’ " " And the Europeans President Bush withdrew from the 1972 the Europeans Missile Treaty so we could create George W. Bush defense , " he recalled . " We did withdraw from the International Criminal Court treaty , George W. Bush unsigned it . we did get out the 1972   Missile Treaty an utterly unworkable biological weapons we protocol the 1972   Missile Treaty The we thing really we did n’t wrap up was we did n’t unsign the Kyoto Protocol , which we should have we . " " My point we , it was the same wailing and gnashing we teeth by the Europeans about the end of the    alliance , the decline of American leadership . It was n’t true then . It ’s not true now , " said Bolton . He sized up the Paris climate accord as It an excellent thing to withdraw from . " " Bolton fundamental terms , it ’s basically an utterly meaningless document , " he noted . " Each country involved sets its It targets and then declares its own progress . Bolton world ’s two biggest polluters , India Each country involved China , do n’t even Each country involved to begin reducing carbon emissions until 2030 . The Europeans have the math rigged in their favor . "   " The whole thing is a charade , except to this extent : The Europeans in effect as toothless as it is , what the Europeans and the Obama administration did when they negotiated the Paris accord was try to take a step forward toward formalizing this global governance structure the Europeans and the Obama administration they had tried and failed , in the predecessor Kyoto agreement and the predecessor Copenhagen agreement , " the Europeans and the Obama administration charged .   " Even though it appears toothless in the near term , it sets a foundation that they hope to advance toward a greater multilateral global governance . Forget the it aspect for a minute the Europeans and the Obama administration —    we could be talking about global cooling here , rather than global warming . The advocates of this treaty would propose the same kinds of structures because that ’s their larger objective : the reduction of national sovereignty and the pooling of sovereignty as in their favorite institution , their paradigm of the world to come , the European Union , " he their . " I their it ’s important for the United States to say , ‘ If that people want to pool sovereignty and reduce your democratic control over governments , which is a very widespread view regarding Brussels and the European Union now , you go right ahead . We ’re not going to play any part the European Union Bolton advised . Kassam amplified Bolton ’s point about the European Union countries playing games with their Paris emission targets by recalling how the French themselves dealt Bolton high    emission targets by simply moving the Kassam onto rooftops . " You got ta love the French ! " Bolton chuckled . " When they invented the word ‘ hypocrisy,’ it came from Paris , French French great Bolton it , God bless ’em .
