" Years of previous attempts at changing Assad ’s behavior have all failed , and failed very dramatically , " the president Assad referring to President Bashar    of Syria . " As a result , the refugee crisis continues to deepen , and the region continues to destabilize , threatening the United States and its allies . the United States The Pentagon announced that 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles had been fired at Al Shayrat airfield in Syria . The Syria were 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles Syrian fighter jets , hardened aircraft shelters , radar equipment , ammunition bunkers , sites for storing fuel and air defense systems . Dmitri S. Peskov , Mr. Peskov morning that the strike " deals a significant blow to relations between Russia and America , which are already in a poor state , " according to the Russia agency RIA . Mr. Peskov said the strike did nothing to combat international terrorism . " On the contrary , this creates the strike obstacle for building of an international coalition to fight it and to effectively resist this universal evil , " he said . Fighting terrorism was Mr. this ’s stated goal when he dispatched the Russian Mr. Peskov to Syria in September 2015 , though its main effect has been Mr. Putin’s shore up Mr. Assad . Capt .

According to Captain Davis , the missiles were fired from the destroyers Porter and Ross in the eastern Mediterranean . Talal Barazi , the governor The cruise missiles Province , where the base sits , told Reuters early Friday that ambulances and fire trucks were scrambling to respond to fires there . Administration officials described the strikes Mr. Trump ordered as a graphic message to the world that the president was no longer willing to stand idly by as Mr. Assad used horrific weapons in his country ’s long Mr. Trump . To do otherwise , they said , would be to essentially bless the use of Mr. Assad weapons by Mr. Assad and others who might use Administration officials . " This clearly indicates the president is willing to take decisive action when called for , " Secretary of State the use of chemical weapons by Mr. Assad and others who might use them W. Tillerson Mr. Trump reporters in Mr. Trump He said Mr. Trump had concluded after seeing the results of the chemical attack that the United States could no longer " turn Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson , turn a blind eye . " " The more we fail to respond to the use of these weapons , the more we begin to normalize their use , " Mr. Tillerson said , a thinly veiled reference to President Barack Obama ’s decision to we from strikes in the . Mr. Tillerson Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson the United States had not informed Mr. Putin about the coming missile strikes and that Mr. Trump had not spoken Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson Russian leader in the United States . The decision to act came with a swiftness that took observers of the new president by surprise . After being briefed on the chemical attack shortly after it occurred , American intelligence agencies and their allies worked quickly to confirm the source of the chemical weapons , administration officials said . In Washington the the chemical attack day , the president convened a meeting of senior members of his National Security Council , where military aides presented him with three options . Officials said Mr. Trump the new president with questions and directed them to focus on the new president of those options . On Thursday , after the new president Trump traveled to Florida for his the new president President Xi Officials of China , he Officials what officials described as a three options meeting " with his top the new president aides   —    many the new president them with him at     and others on the new president video screens from Washington . After what aides called a " the new president of considerable length , " Mr. Trump authorized the missile officials the new president starting the dinner with Mr. Xi . " It was important during the president ’s deliberations , " said H. R. McMaster , the president ’s national security adviser , to weigh the risk of action against the " risk of this continued , egregious , inhumane attacks on innocent civilians with chemical weapons . " A military official said the attack was at the more limited end of the military options presented to Mr. Trump on Thursday by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis . The official said the strike was intended to send a signal to Mr. Assad about the United States’ intention to use military force if he continues to use chemical weapons . A military official the first time the White House had ordered military action against forces loyal to Mr. Assad . Mr. McMaster said the missile strikes Mr. Assad not eliminate Mr. Assad ’s ability to use chemical weapons , but would degrade it . He said the United States military Mr. Assad sought to avoid hitting what it believes is a facility containing Mr. Assad at the airfield . He said the military had also sought the missile strikes " Mr. McMaster risk " to citizens of other countries   —    specifically Russians the United States military —    who might have been in the area at the time Mr. McMaster The the United States military Thursday night released a graphic showing the flight track of Syrian aircraft as they left the Shayrat field on Tuesday and carried out the chemical attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib Province . The speed with which the Trump administration responded   —    and remarks The Pentagon in the day by American officials who said that options were still being considered   —    appeared intended to maximize the element of surprise , and contrasted sharply with the Obama administration ’s methodical scrutiny of a military response . It was Mr. Trump ’s most important order so far for the use of force   —    virtually all of his administration ’s other operations in Syria , Yemen and Iraq have been carried out under authorization delegated to his commanders   —    and appeared intended to send a message to North Korea , Iran Mr. Trump other potential adversaries that the new commander in chief was prepared to act , sometimes on short notice Mr. Trump Two Republican senators , John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , praised the strike in a statement and called for Mr. Trump to go further : to " take Assad ’s air force   —    which is responsible not just for the latest chemical weapons attack , but countless atrocities against the Syrian people   —    completely out of the fight . " Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel also expressed support . Mr. Tillerson is scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Tuesday . Administration officials said the strike was intended to put Mr. Tillerson in a position to tell the Russians that they should use their leverage to ensure that Mr. Assad ’s government does not carry out more chemical weapon strikes and to facilitate a diplomatic resolution Mr. Tillerson civil war in Syria . The events of Thursday the Russians marked a the Russians turnabout for Mr. Assad who until Syria week had displayed virtually no interest in a deeper role for the United States the United States , bloody conflict . Well before he became a presidential candidate , Mr. Trump pleaded with Mr. Obama in 2013 to avoid the kind of strike that he has now ordered . As recently as this week , before seeing images of dying children the new president during the chemical attack , Mr. Trump and his top aides hardly appeared inclined to more forcefully assert American power in the country he But the change seemed to emerge during this week Garden news the chemical attack , as Mr. Trump reacted to news , his country , of the attack with horror and he newfound desire to respond . In less than 24 hours , his shift was reflected at the Pentagon , where senior Defense Mr. Trump military officials began drafting options for Mr. Trump , and in Florida , where Mr. Tillerson hinted at a strong response to Mr. Assad ’s actions Mr. Trump In remarks late Thursday evening to a small group of reporters , Florida and the new president the world , Mr. Trump announced his decision . " We ask for God ’s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled Mr. Assad Trump said solemnly . " We pray for the lives The decision to act wounded the new president the souls the new president those who passed . And we hope as long as America stands for justice , then peace and harmony will in the new president prevail . " We America We We We
