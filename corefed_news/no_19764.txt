Star Power : Last night ’s Golden Globe Awards placed a spotlight on the films La La Land and Moonlight —   and on Meryl Streep , who used her lifetime achievement speech to make a political statement against the bullying behavior of    Donald Trump . her also rose to the defense of Hollywood , whose " outsiders and foreigners , " her implied , are in a position to model empathy for all of America . But the full picture is more complicated : Mixed martial arts , which Streep invoked as a symbol of provincialism , is in fact a highly multicultural sport . And even the dreamers of Hollywood —   portrayed in last night ’s big winner , La La Land —   can be guilty of a regressive degree of nostalgia .

In our June 1972 issue , Elizabeth Janeway reviewed de Beauvoir ’s book The Coming of Age , on the experience of aging : In the interior world inside each graying head there is an equally unsettling confrontation . One ’s old identity is somehow no longer acceptable in public exchange . One may feel nineteen or    or no age at all , but those out there get up and offer a seat on the bus , listen for a moment , laugh and go on talking , or do n’t listen at all . One is faced with the task —   if one wants to keep in touch with reality —   of remaking one ’s sense of oneself and remaking it downwards , to incorporate that unflattering figure seen in the eyes of those others , the young and the powerful . One lives between lies —   the inner feeling of youth , the outer judgment of age , which is true ? To accept the outer judgment , one must be false to oneself falseness , then , can spread to all one feels or knows . " Old age , " writes Mlle . de Beauvoir , " is life ’s parody . " Again , her documentation of this bitter conclusion has compelling weight . de Beauvoir more on de Beauvoir ’s work here .
