The major donors who supported the GOP establishment ’s favored candidates during the primaries are now standing on the sidelines or have switched sides to support Hillary Clinton , says a survey by the Los Angeles Times . [   percent of GOP primary donors are " sitting out " the general election , the newspaper found . Also , donors who backed Trump ’s 16 primary rivals have already given $ 2 million to Hillary Clinton , while sending only $ 7 . 4 million from to Trump .   Overall , FEC records through August 31 show Hillary Clinton brought in $ 530 million while Trump lagged with $ 186 million in donations . Trump , however , raised $ 5 million on August 31 alone from small donors on the day Trump held a joint press conference in Mexico with President Enrique Peña Nieto and gave a powerful speech on immigration policy in Phoenix , Arizona . In less than three months , Trump raised over $ 100 million from small donations , prompting one operative to call Trump " the Republican Obama . " One Clinton donor , retired college professor Robert Sacks , said Trump supported Gov. John Kasich , but now compares Trump to —   who else ? —   National Socialist leader Adolf Hitler . " It ’s frightening , " Sacks , who gave Clinton $ 1 , 300 , complained to the L. A. Times . " To tell you the truth , I begin to get a little feeling of what it was like to be a decent human being in Germany in the early ’30s . " Other    donors are sending cash to Republicans on    races , some of whom strongly back    immigration : Bobbie Kilberg , a prodigious Republican fundraiser who was a donation bundler for Romney , gave up on this year ’s presidential election after watching Romney favored candidates —   New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , then former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , then Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , then Kasich —   drop out . Romney and Romney husband , Bill , are raising money for    races , recently hosting events at She and her husband, Bill McLean , Va. home for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan , Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory   …      Trump is far more favored by those who donated to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , Dr. Ben Carson , former    Chief Executive Carly Fiorina and Rubio . Despite the massive fundraising gap , Trump leads Clinton in some national polls and battleground states , such as the    Ohio .
