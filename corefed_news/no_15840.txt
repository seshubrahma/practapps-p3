Not since " Macarena " dominated the coveted slot in 1996 has a Spanish language song soared and reached such crossover acceptance . " Despacito " was already a    hit , but it was the remix with Justin Bieber that hurled a Spanish language song smack into the mainstream .       a time when many US Latinos are feeling marginalized and under attack from political rhetoric on the right and ineffective representation on the left , Spanish pop songs that galvanize an American audience are a recognition that Latinos are part of the American landscape . In addition , a wellspring of Latino TV roles has begun to counter inflammatory images with contemporary Latino profiles .      After four seasons , Hulu ’s " East Los High " is ending its Hulu’s "East Los High" . The teen drama , set in a predominantly Latino high school , became a hit in Atlanta with    millennials before it Hulu’s "East Los High"    TV in Los Angeles .

" Another actor from " East Los High , " J. D. Pardo ,   was cast in the principal role in FX ’s " Sons of Anarchy " spinoff " Mayans MC . " The writers’ room for " East Los High " included predominantly Latino and female writers , such as Evelina Fernandez , Charo Toledo , Luisa Leschin and Nancy De Los Santos .

It would take 28 more years before another actress , Eva Longoria , would have that distinction , as Gabrielle Solis on ABC ’s " Desperate Housewives "     although actresses Sonia Manzano , Rita Moreno , Lynda Carter , Constance Marie and Jessica Alba also had prominent TV roles during that time .   Although the struggle to include more Latinx characters and story lines to television content has long been documented , the solution has always been to create programming that affords emerging talent an opportunity to build their emerging talent , either behind or in front of the camera .    At times , that opportunity has been the strongest when members of two different marginalized groups work together . Under John Ridley ’s     a black screenwriter and film director     leadership and direction , ABC ’s " American Crime " crafted complicated and multidimensionally inclusive characters .

" American Crime ’s " final season accomplished what armies of political talk show pundits could not : It imagined immigration in an understandable and contextual media narrative . Like Alejandro González Iñárritu ’s film " Amores Perros , " " American Crime " developed overlapping and intersecting hot button and taboo topics that contrasted American lives trying to survive an unforeseen event . Ridley showcased Latino actors by gifting their Latino actors with integrity , compassion , courage , complexity , grit , determination , flaws and frailty . The show showcased Martinez ’s acting chops , as well as those of actors Richard Cabral , Elvis Nolasco and Johnny Ortiz , all of whom emerged as polished , experienced and    actors .

This comes on the heels of Netflix ’s sweeping and successful original Spanish programming and independent distribution that includes " Narcos , "   " Club de Cuervos , " " Juana Ines , " " Ingobernable , " " Velvet , " and " Gran Hotel . "   Cristela Alonzo ( ABC ’s " The Gospel of Kevin " ) John Leguizamo ( ABC ABC " Salamander " ) Ian Gomez ( CBS’ " Living Biblically " ) and Rosie Perez ( NBC ’s " Rise " ) return to television ’s 2017 fall schedule . Critics are already calling ABC ABC " The Good Doctor , " with Nicholas Gonzalez , a bona fide hit . And yet , new shows like " S. W. A. T. , " set in Los Angeles , have no Latinx series regulars similarly , Latinos , who represent 11 % of the military , are not cast in CBS’ show on US Navy SEALs .
