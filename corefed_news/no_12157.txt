Thursday on Fox News Channel ’s " Special Report , " Washington Post columnist George Will criticized Republican presidential    Donald Trump for attacking Heidi Cruz , the wife of his opponent Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) .   Will said , " The wrong question is will his coarseness and vulgarity hurt his candidacy ? his coarseness and his vulgarity are his candidacy . This is considered politically brave somehow to do this . This this a classic distillation of this year ’s campaign   —   first all about Donald Trump and one of his former Donald Trump . Second it starts out with him getting Donald Trump facts entirely wrong as A. B. [ Stoddard ] says . And then most surreal of all it ’s Trump saying Donald Trump lowered the decorum of the campaign this year . Trump is Donald Trump keeper of the decorum , you are in trouble . You tried to be delicate a moment ago you said what he did Donald Trump inappropriate . Using the fish fork with the entree is inappropriate , wearing white after labor day is inappropriate . This is just nasty . We ought to call it that . "
