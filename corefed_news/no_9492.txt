[ Perennial presidential loser Mitt Romney would be Bill Kristol could Bill Kristol for , and Mitt could n’t beat John McCain or Barack Obama , so even Mitt Mitt Mitt a " real chance . "   While it is within the realm of possibility that Kristol finally Bill Kristol someone to launch a hopeless campaign to spite Donald Trump , it ’s more likely that Kristol was Bill Kristol engaging in wishful thinking : Just a heads up over this holiday weekend : There will be an independent candidate —   an impressive one , with a strong team and a real chance .   —    Bill Kristol ( @BillKristol ) May 29 , 2016 , After the media firestorm , Kristol ’s Bill Kristol tweet created , he returned Bill Kristol Twitter claiming to have " unnerved " Donald Trump with his unsubstantiated Bill Kristol . I ’m traveling , so had n’t realized I ’d so upset @realDonaldTrump . I ’m sorry the mere mention of an independent candidate has so unnerved him . Bill Kristol —    Bill Kristol ( @BillKristol ) May 30 , 2016 , I hope my mention of an independent candidate did n’t distract him while Bill Kristol respects during whichever Memorial Day ceremony he attended Bill Kristol   —    Bill Kristol ( @BillKristol ) May 30 , 2016 , For Kristol it is n’t even the first time this election cycle he has made Kristol claims about a candidate entering the race . Late last year he claimed to Kristol information that Vice President Joe Biden would get into the race : the race told by Democrat I trust that Biden " almost certain Vice President Joe Biden to run , will announce this week in time to speak at the Iowa    dinner Sat night .   —    Bill Kristol ( @BillKristol ) October 18 , 2015 , Biden confirms to Obama Vice President Joe Biden lunch today he ’s running , Vice President Joe Biden at U Delaware tomorrow . You can feel the Joementum !   —    Bill Kristol ( @BillKristol ) October 20 , 2015 , Before that , in June 2015 he claimed to even Vice President Joe Biden information on Biden ’s running mate Vice President Joe Biden , there will be a female NY Senator on the 2016 Dem ticket . But it will be Kirsten Gillibrand , as Joe Biden ’s VP pick .   —    Bill Kristol ( @BillKristol ) June 4 , 2015 , Like many establishment " analysts " this election cycle Kristol has gotten nearly everything wrong : Sticking with my prediction : Trump will win no caucuses or primaries , and will run behind Ron Paul 2012 in IA and NH .   —    Bill Kristol ( @BillKristol ) December 8 , 2015 , NH prediction , 5 days out : Rubio 25 , Cruz 22 , Trump 19 , Kasich 17 , others single digits . # NoGutsNoGlory ,   —    Bill Kristol ( @BillKristol ) February 4 , 2016 , Prediction : Neither party will nominate either of the the top two candidates in the polls .
