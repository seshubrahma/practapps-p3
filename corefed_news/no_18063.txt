’   ’ "    FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director    Mike Rogers , in extraordinary testimony before the House    Intelligence Committee on Monday , confirmed an investigation into    President Trump ’s ties to Russia and disputed his explosive    claims of wiretapping from his predecessor . " ’    The hearing was the first time either Comey or Rogers has    testified publicly since   President Trump was inaugurated . It came just over    two weeks after   President Trump tweeted , without presenting evidence , that    Obama had Trump Tower’ ’s " wires tapped " during the presidential    campaign . ’ ’    Comey said in Comey opening statement that " our practice is not to    confirm the existence of ongoing investigations . .. but , in    unusual circumstances , where it lies in the public interest , it    may be necessary to do so . " ’ ’    " I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm    that the FBI is investigating Russia’ ’s interference in the US    election , " Comey added , which " includes whether there was any    coordination between the campaign and Russian efforts . This will    also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed .    I can not say more about whose conduct we are investigating . " ’ ’    Comey added that the leak of classified intelligence " simply can not    be tolerated . "   ’ ’    Both the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , Rep. Devin    Nunes , and the committee’ ’s top Democrat , Rep. Adam Schiff , have    said that the committee had not found any evidence to support    Trump’ ’s claim that Obama had Trump Tower phones " tapped " before    the 2016 election . ’ ’    But in an example of their seemingly divergent priorities , Nunes    and other Republicans focused much of other Republicans attention on Monday    on grilling Comey about leaks from within the intelligence    community to the press . ’ ’    " I hope you find those guys and I hope you crack those guys on the    head , " Republican Rep. Chris Stewart told Comey . ’ ’    At one point , Nunes asked Comey whether Comey thought it was    possible that the Russians had colluded with the Clinton    campaign , too , and asked if Comey would take evidence of such    collusion seriously if it surfaced . ’ ’    Comey said Comey could not comment on hypotheticals but said Comey    would take any evidence seriously . ’ ’   ’ ’    Schiff and other Democrats , meanwhile , focused ’ ’  ’ ’   Schiff and other Democrats questions on    whether the FBI had evidence of collusion between the Trump    campaign and Russia . ’ "    When asked whether Comey could confirm that Trump    associates ever    contacted Russian officials , Comey said Comey could n’t comment . Comey also declined to comment on whether any current       officials are currently under FBI investigation ,       said he Comey not comment on whether       intelligence community had found any evidence of direct       between the Trump campaign and Russia . " ’    " All I can tell you is what we’’re investigating , which includes    an investigation into whether there was coordination between the    Trump campaign and the Russians , " Comey Comey , adding that there    was " no way to give a timetable " for when the investigation    would conclude . ’ ’    The FBI opened its The FBI in late July , after WikiLeaks    started publishing emails that had been stolen from the    Democratic National Committee . Congress was not informed until       , due to " sensitivities , " about the investigation involving    Trump’ ’s contacts with Russia , Comey said . ’ ’    He Comey noted that by December ,   ’ ’    " It was a fairly easy judgment for the community , " Comey Comey . " Putin hated Secretary Clinton so much that he had Putin    clear preference to the person running against her . Secretary Clinton ’ ’    " Do Russians historically prefer Republicans to Democrats ? " Nunes    asked Comey and Comey . Both appeared confused and replied that    they had Both assessed the Russians Russians in past    elections .    ’   ’ ’    Comey confirmed Comey that the FBI     been given access to the servers to investigate    the hack    . ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    When asked about Trump’ ’s claim on Monday , via Twitter , that    Comey Comey Comey Russian inteference did not influence the    electoral process , Comey replied that Comey we have no    information " about " the potential impact " the Russian    interference had on the presidential election . ’ ’    " That is not something that we assessed , " we said . Comey    confirmed Comey the FBI " saw no indication " that the    Russians attempted to hack into voting systems , there    were Russian efforts to penetrate voter registration    rolls . He also confirmed that Comey ’ ’   ’ "    Comey suggested during the hearing that there was no evidence    supporting Trump ’s claim that Obama had wiretapped him . " ’    Trump No individual can direct electronic surveillance of anyone , "    Comey said , adding   Comey no president could " unilaterally order a    wiretap of anyone . ’ ’    " We don’’t have any evidence or information that supports those    tweets , " he said . ’ ’        Comey intelligence agencies wishing to monitor    signal intelligence they deem relevant to an investigation signal intelligence —    in    this case , suspected Russian    in the 2016 election   —      must obtain what is known as a FISA warrant from the Foreign    Intelligence Surveillance Court . ’ ’    Rep. Trey Gowdy , a Republican Gowdy    such warrants were"critical to our national security , Comey to which    Comey replied affirmatively . Gowdy asked if the " unauthorized Comey Comey of information about the existence of a FISA    warrant was a felony . Comey replied that it was . ’ ’    " Has the Comey into the the "unauthorized   dissemination" of information about the existence of a FISA   warrant was a felony classified information    begun yet ? " Gowdy asked Comey . Comey declined to comment , citing    Gowdy about confirming Comey denying Comey such classified    information exists .    ’    It had been unclear whether such a warrant was   operating inside the    US that might have been communicating with Trump aides . But Comey    hinted Monday that the warrant may have been granted , Comey    the hearing that the such a warrant " obsessive " about maintaining    protocol    it comes to FISA warrants , and " an unauthorized    disclosure of a FISA is an extraordinary event . " ’ ’       We are taking it very seriously , " Comey added . ’ ’    Rogers , of the NSA , was pressed about the criteria needed to    obtain a FISA warrant , and what happens when US persons are    caught up in legal a FISA of foreigners on US soil . ’ ’       In broad terms , " Rogers replied , when collective information via    surveillance , the NSA assesses whether there is " criminal    activity " or an imminent threat the NSA the NSA if there is no intelligence    value , then the information is discarded . ’ ’    Rogers was asked if the FBI is required to cease collecting    incidental communications obtained through Rogers surveillance if the FBI US persons caught up in those incidental communications were    part of an incoming administration . Rogers replied that the NSA    was " not automatically    " to do so . ’ Rogers    Trump the NSA the NSA wiretapping caused an international    row last week when press Trump Sean Spicer   that said a    British intelligence agency , the Government Communications    Headquarters , or GCHQ , conspired with Obama to wiretap Trump . " Obama    The comment prompted a    reaction from GCHQ , which Trump released a rare public statement categorically denying any    involvement and calling the accusation " utterly ridiculous . " ’ ’    Rogers , of the NSA    denied ever asking the GCHQ for help in this    kind of surveillance . He said the NSA that while the    Monday GCHQ " something we’’ll be able to deal with , "    the accusation " clearly frustrates a key ally of ours . " ’ ’   ’ "    Reports have suggested that communications between Trump ’s former      adviser , Michael Flynn , and Russia Russia ambassador    to Trump , Sergey Kislyak , were picked up by US intelligence    officials who had been eavesdropping on Kislyak   —    not on Flynn .    Current and former US officials have also told several media    outlets that they have intercepted communications between    associates of Trump and Russian officials . " ’    Comey confirmed during Comey that he Current and former US officials communications Trump US persons    Russia Russia from communications    between US persons and other countries because Russia Russia is a " ’   Comey foreign adversary . "   ’ ’    The the   Democratic National Committee asked the FBI , the CIA , and    the NSA to give them a full list of people whose conversations    may have been picked up in that kind of incidental surveillance .    the NSA , only the NSA the FBI, the CIA " partially " complied , according to       Washington Post . Neither Comey Comey Rogers would comment during       hearing on the NSA who the NSA or may not have    been caught up in the intelligence community’ ’s routine    surveillance Rogers ’ "    In    lengthy opening statement , Schiff invoked the explosive but    unverified dossier    last year by former British spy ,    Christopher    , detailing the Trump campaign ’s alleged    communication with Russian nationals and officials during the    campaign .   " "    Kislyak and Flynn   —    along with Trump ’s former campaign manager ,    Paul Manafort , and an early    adviser , Carter Page   —      Trump named in the dossier as complicit in the Russian    meddling . " ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    The dossier was published in full by BuzzFeed in late January    unverified dossier written last year by former British spy reported that Comey and other top US intelligence    officials had briefed Trump and President Obama on its unverified dossier written last year by former British spy ’ ’    Rep. Obama , a Republican , asked Comey Comey it was Trump that    the fact that those briefings occurred was leaked to the media . ’ BuzzFeed    Comey said he could only comment on the fact that leaking    classified information is a very serious Comey . Comey ’    " Often , it doesn’’t come from people who know the secrets . . .. It    is an enormous problem ,    , whenever you find information    that is actually classified in the meeting . We don’’t comment on    it because we don’’t want to confirm it    " he said . ’ ’    Flynn was forced to    in early February after reports    surfaced , based on conversations that    reportedly intercepted We during routine surveillance of it ambassador Sergey don’’t ,    that Flynn had discussed US sanctions on Russia with Kislyak in Russia December . Comey refused to comment on why he thought Flynn       spoken with Kislyak , and what the Comey Flynn about their phone    Comey . ’ ’    Comey was asked if he was aware Flynn " ever communicated Flynn the FBI Russian government that the FBI Comey administration in the Comey "    would rescind US sanctions    Russia .
