According to Chuck Todd , the Republican Party has to play nice with Republican presidential   Donald Trump supporters because without Trump supporters , the Republican Party ca n’t win a general election . " Republicans do n’t win general elections without Republican presidential   Donald Trump ’s voters , " Chuck Todd said on MSNBC . " OK , these folks have been frequent general election voters . They these folks n’t been frequent not primary voters , right . This is what there ’s been a question   —    we used to call them these folks Democrats . There ’s been different names given over the years   —    certainly working class . Whatever you want to classify them these folks , it ’s the same chunk of voters who have not been involved in primary politics in the past . And that ’s why there has been skepticism with traditional Republicans , ‘ Well , maybe they wo n’t come to the polls.’ But you ca n’t alienate them they You alienate them they they they home then Republicans wo n’t win general elections . Reince Priebus is being the correct party leader here . You do n’t want to trash Trump supporters . " (   RCP Video ) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
