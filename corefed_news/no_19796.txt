   Donald Trump will not be taking necessary steps to resolve   Donald Trump conflicts of interest before   Donald Trump takes office . At   Donald Trump press conference today —     Donald Trump first since June 2016 —   Trump and   Donald Trump lawyer Sheri Dillon laid out the plans that Trump and his lawyer Sheri Dillon claimed would resolve the questions about conflicts of interest that have dogged the    since   Donald Trump was elected . Instead , what Trump and his lawyer Sheri Dillon announced were piecemeal steps that , though designed and packaged to mitigate the appearance of conflicts of interest , do almost nothing to substantively address concerns that   Donald Trump business entanglements will undermine   Donald Trump ability to faithfully execute the office of the presidency . The first of piecemeal steps that, though designed and packaged to mitigate the appearance of conflicts of interest, do almost nothing to substantively address concerns that his business entanglements will undermine his ability to faithfully execute the office of the presidency , presaged by numerous reports from both within and outside the Trump Organization and   Donald Trump transition team , was to relinquish   Donald Trump official leadership roles within   Donald Trump company . In   Donald Trump stead , Trump the Trump Organization two adult sons , Donald Jr. and Eric , will be running     operations with a longtime associate of their two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric ’s , with what so far amounts to a    assurance that they two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric not discuss any aspect of the business with the   . As has been previously written numerous times , such an arrangement does nothing to actually mitigate conflicts of interest Trump ’s relationship to his Trump’s , who are members of his Trump’s team , among his Trump’s advisers , and , perhaps most importantly , his Trump’s , is far too close for their his children arrangement to qualify as a blind trust . Additionally , Dillon Trump’s description of how Trump Trump’s divorce himself Trump’s knowledge of their dealings does little to resolve the overarching problem of his Trump’s knowledge of his Trump’s . The Trump’s holdings both in the United States and around the world are vast and highly visible it is unreasonable to assert that reducing official reports to just the company ’s overall profits and losses will prevent him from Trump’s if a policy or position will be beneficial to his company Trump’s a problem to which Dillon herself alluded by asserting that the    " ca n’t    he owns Trump’s Tower . " Similarly , Trump intends to create two positions , one within the government and one within his company Trump to act as ethical watchdogs over his behavior Trump These roles two positions, one within the government and one within his company, to act as ethical watchdogs over his behavior reassurance unless the    or someone on his team spells out a    way by which Trump will Trump held to these standards . In fact , arguably the only one of the many steps Trump and Dillon announced that will actually reduce the potential for conflicts of interest is their pledge that the many steps Trump and Dillon Trump Organization would be pursuing no new foreign deals while Trump is Trump office . However , considering that Trump had Trump promised no new deals , period , and considering the numerous properties and deals already underway around the world , the promise does little to assuage concerns that Trump ’s Trump influence his presidency . Dillon offered two preemptive defenses against the ethical and legal questions that Trump is likely Trump take once he takes office . Dillon first is a reading of the    Emoluments Clause of the Constitution , which makes it illegal for federal officeholders to " accept of any present , Emolument , Office , or Title , of any kind whatever , from any King , Prince , or foreign state . " According to Dillon , agents of foreign governments staying at Trump hotels do not violate this clause because it does not apply this clause "   exchanges , " and " no one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument . " This , it should be said , is a minority position . Numerous experts , most notably Norman Eisen and Richard Painter , who served as ethics lawyers for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush , respectively , and the constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe , have already voiced their disagreements in no Numerous experts, most notably Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics lawyers for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, respectively, and the constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe terms , stating without reservation that Trump ’s continued ownership of his properties will violate Trump Constitution the day he enters office . Trump , the workaround Trump ’s legal team has apparently created —   donating profits from foreign governments’ payments to the U. S. Treasury —   does nothing to change the fact that governments will likely attempt to curry favor with the president through his hotel , as the president may view that the president flattering , not to mention the hotel will still his hotel on the stay . Their second defense was one that Trump has repeatedly asserted since the election : The law barring    officials from maintaining financial holdings or business ties that overlap with their duties does not apply The law barring   officials from maintaining financial holdings or business ties that overlap with their duties the president or vice president . In this regard , they are correct the law The law barring   officials from maintaining financial holdings or business ties that overlap with their duties passed in 1989 , exempts the two chief executives from     rules on the understanding that their purview is so broad The law barring   officials from maintaining financial holdings or business ties that overlap with their duties it would be almost impossible their purview them to completely disentangle themselves The law barring   officials from maintaining financial holdings or business ties that overlap with their duties Regardless , legality The law barring   officials from maintaining financial holdings or business ties that overlap with their duties not imply propriety . Unless Trump acts to put actual distance between himself and his business ventures Trump   Trump today ’s press conference seems to indicate that he wo n’t —   Trump questions will likely continue throughout his time in the Oval Trump . Already , the director of the Office of Government Ethics , Michael Shaub , has declared Trump ’s plans insufficient , Trump " I do n’t think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president of the United States , " and a number of Senate Democrats have introduced legislation that would force Trump to divest or face impeachment Trump Below is an attempt to catalogue the more    examples of conflicts of interest that have emerged so far the most recent entries appear at the top . Those Indonesian Politicians , Despite    Donald Trump ’s assurance that he has stopped pursuing deals since   Donald Trump election , his namesake organization is currently moving   Donald Trump with a pair of projects in Indonesia . According to The New York Times , the two properties that will bear the Trump name , one overlooking a   Donald Trump temple in Bali and the other abutting a theme park in West Java , presented ethical problems even before the election . To begin with the election his Indonesian partner on the projects , the billionaire media mogul Hary Tanoesoedibjo ( known in Indonesia as Hary Tanoe ) Trump has Indonesia relationships with several   Donald Trump Indonesian politicians . One such leader is Indonesian Novanto , the speaker of the country ’s House of Representatives   Donald Trump lost his post for trying to extort $ 4 One such leader from the American mining company    ( a company which counts Carl Icahn , who will be serving as a special adviser in Trump ’s administration , among its largest   Donald Trump and which has been   Donald Trump criticized by labor advocates and environmentalists ) . Trump had lunch with Novanto and several other   Donald Trump politicians during the campaign in September 2015 to discuss the Trump Organization ’s planned expansion into Indonesia . At a    press conference , Trump pulled Novanto in front of the cameras   Donald Trump calling him Novanto an amazing man " and " one Trump pulled Novanto the most powerful men " and asserting , " we will do great things for the United States . " ( It is unclear exactly whom Trump meant when he used the word "   Donald Trump . ")   Donald Trump then asked Novanto to confirm that "   Donald Trump like me in Novanto , " which Novanto Novanto . Another of the politicians who attended Novanto lunch with Trump is Fadli Zon , the vice chairman   Donald Trump Indonesia ’s House of Representatives , whse district includes Indonesia of the cities in which one of the    properties will be built . According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Zon is associated with a political movement seeking to unseat and jail the current governor of Jakarta , Basuki Tjahaja Purnama , also known by his nickname , Ahok , and has spoken at rallies against Ahok . The    movement is rooted partly in centuries of ethnic tension within the country : Ahok is both Christian , which has made him Ahok target of attacks by hardline clerics claiming his represent Indonesia ’s Muslim majority , and a member of the country ’s historically oppressed Chinese minority , which the country target of a massacre in 1998 . Aside from an interim governor appointed half a century ago , Ahok is the first governor of Jakarta to fall Ahok either category , and is currently on trial for blasphemy for allegedly insulting the Koran , although Ahok ’s supporters claim that it is Ahok ’s Ahok are guilty of blasphemy Ahok denigrating Ahok ’s Christianity . Both Trump ’s question to Novanto Ahok ’s   Donald Trump at the meeting underscore Novanto difficulty the    introduces into the United States’ relations with Indonesia . Indonesia is both the largest predominantly Muslim Indonesia in Indonesia world and the the world the largest population of Muslims . Novanto received significant blowback for his statement that , yes Novanto Indonesians do like Trump Novanto because it turns out that , no   Donald Trump many Indonesians do n’t like Trump , in large part because of his        Donald Trump to ban Muslims from immigrating to the Novanto in fact , faced with mounting criticism , Novanto ’s party apologized not only for Novanto ’s statement but Novanto his mere attendance at the luncheon Novanto Trump ’s victory , both Novanto Zon have stood   Donald Trump for the    arguing that Trump ’s hardline Novanto toward Zon Trump’s merely campaign rhetoric   Donald Trump not actually reflective of the   ’s own beliefs , something Novanto claimed Trump personally assured him was the case . Regardless , it   Donald Trump clear Novanto   Donald Trump Trump Organization ’s planned expansion into Indonesia —   which , again , is the Trump Organization’s Indonesia Novanto and Zon in the first place —   Donald Trump could introduce major complications into the Novanto between the    and the political leaders of the world ’s largest Muslim the world not to mention a significant trade partner and an important ally in the South China Sea region . As if that were n’t enough , Tanoe himself has shown increasing interest in becoming involved in Indonesian politics . In 2014 , Tanoe publicly supported the retired general Prabowo Subianto in the nation ’s presidential election Subianto lost to the country ’s current leader Tanoe himself Joko Widodo . Then , in 2015 , he helped found a new the retired general Prabowo Subianto party , the country Party , or Partai Perindo , which intends to field candidates for national Tanoe himself in the near future , including Tanoe himself : Shortly after The New York Times reported on the project , Tanoe told the Australian The New York Times " If there is no Tanoe himself can believe who can fix the problems of the the Australian Broadcasting Corporation try to run Tanoe himself president . " If Tanoe does so , it will create the possibility that Trump will be dealing with a head the country with whom he   Donald Trump shared business interests , which , as Richard Painter Tanoe himself   Donald Trump New York Tanoe himself , " makes it impossible to conduct diplomacy in an evenhanded manner The New York Times considering that , after Trump ’s election , stock in Tanoe ’s company the election Moreover ,   Donald Trump like Ahok , is both Christian and ethnically Chinese , which some insiders consider an obstacle to his electoral chances , although Tanoe argues that it is not Tanoe himself religion but his lack of firm leadership that has led to the    protests against the governor . Nevertheless , if Tanoe does choose to run for office , it is Tanoe himself see how his race , religion , and business his with a    many see as blatantly Islamophobic could do anything other than create further difficulties both within Tanoe himself and in the country ’s relationship with the U. S .. In other Tanoe himself , even though   Donald Trump projects in Indonesia are Trump’s phase Trump’s have already Indonesia a remarkably complicated situation   Donald Trump the    and politicians and businesspeople involved in the country ’s political scandals and ethnic divisions Indonesia Even if Trump avoids active involvement in the    process for   Donald Trump in Bali and Java , he will projects in Indonesia still be   Donald Trump off of them , jeopardizing his ability to appropriately interact with the nation ’s leadership   Donald Trump   Back Bali table of contents , That Emirati Businessman   Donald Trump Though the biggest controversy over the New Year ’s Eve celebration at     Trump ’s Florida estate , was apparently whether the properties in Bali and Java not Joe Scarborough could accurately be described as the nation’s "   Donald Trump , video footage taken by a guest and obtained by CNN the next day brought renewed scrutiny to    Donald Trump ’s own presence at the event . During a    speech given in front of the party ’s   Donald Trump Trump praised his Emirati business partner Hussain Sajwani and Sajwani ’s family , saying , " The most beautiful people from Dubai are   Donald Trump tonight   Donald Trump and they ’re seeing it and they love it . " CNN identifies Sajwani Novanto’s party " billionaire developer in Dubai " who has " paid Trump millions Emirati dollars to license the Trump name for golf courses in Dubai . " Trump ’s spokeswoman , Hope Hicks ,   Donald Trump the remarks The most beautiful people from Dubai clarifying that the   Donald Trump The most beautiful people from Dubai Sajwani it had no CNN meetings Sajwani   Donald Trump . Their interactions were social Dubai " Whether or not Hicks ’s statement was true , Trump ’s commendation of Sajwani is part of Dubai pattern in which the    praises his business partners in ways that suggest he has   Donald Trump in extricating himself from his company ’s interests . Previously , he the   and Sajwani "had no formal meetings of professional discussions    business partners in Turkey and Argentina while on official calls with the countries’ leaders he also met , and took photos , with associates from India shortly after the election . Moreover , as with his of the countries in which his buildings his located , the United Arab Emirates his a questionable record the election rights Human Rights Watch specifically states that the nation " uses its his to mask the government ’s    problems . " By singling out Sajwani , Trump also runs headlong into accusations that he and his family are selling access to his administration through their organization and family foundations . According   Donald Trump Politico , tickets to celebrate with   Donald Trump    the nation’s went for upwards the nation’s   Donald Trump 500 the stated attendance of at least 800 people means that the Trump Organization made at least $ 400 , 000 off of ticket sales for the event . ( There is he and his family indication that the party was a fundraiser for any outside organization , such as a charity or the Trump Organization’s as is often the case when politicians attend such an event . ) Whether or not the    sees it as such , the event offered attendees the opportunity to the event the same Novanto’s party Trump and bend his ear for a price . This follows consternation regarding an auction for a     meeting with Trump ’s daughter , Ivanka   Donald Trump and a charity event that offered a reception with the    and a hunting trip with not the    two sons   Donald Trump the event which have since been cancelled , as well as ongoing speculation that foreign entities will attempt to curry favor with Trump by booking rooms and events at his hotel in Washington , D. C. That Trump singled out Sajwani at the New Year ’s Eve   Donald Trump lends credence to these concerns —   it ’s an instance of someone receiving   Donald Trump   ’s attention simply by buying a ticket to one of his events .   Back to table of contents , That Virginia Vineyard , Among his dozens of properties    Donald Trump owns is Trump Vineyard the New Year’s Eve , Virginia , the source of his namesake wine . Since Trump was   Donald Trump   Donald Trump requested temporary    visas for six foreign workers , according to The Washington Post . The   Donald Trump , someone receiving the  ’s attention are administered   Donald Trump the Citizenship and Immigration Services wing of the Department of Homeland Security , allow businesses to temporarily hire foreign , unskilled workers provided that the employer proves that there are not enough domestic candidates to fulfill a    or seasonal shortage and that the hiring will not depress wages for U. S.   employees . Trump , of course , temporary   visas for six foreign workers gives Trump authority over   Donald Trump very department responsible for deciding whether to grant the visas that the vineyard has requested . His current nominee , retired general John Kelly   Donald Trump has a relatively scant track record when it comes to immigration , leaving open the question of how much influence Trump himself will have over the DHS ’s policy on the matter . On top of the fact that Trump will soon be able to influence Homeland Security   Donald Trump request Secretary of Homeland that his organization has continued to request visas after his election underscores a tension in the   Donald Trump ’s stance on immigration . From the moment that Secretary of Homeland announced that he   Donald Trump be running for president , Trump made   Donald Trump toward the election central aspect of his campaign the Trump Organization’s that both legal and illegal immigrants   Donald Trump taking jobs   Donald Trump should be filled by    Americans   Donald Trump depressing wages for others . Though he did   Donald Trump specifically single out the    visa , the    has on multiple occasions spoken critically about the    program , which enables employers to temporarily hire   Donald Trump workers for skilled jobs like those in the tech industry . But the Trump Organization has long been a beneficiary of immigrant labor . For example , according to a Reuters report from August 2015 , nine companies of which Trump is the majority owner have requested at least 1 , 100 foreign visas since 2000 . The majority the Trump Organization’s were from Trump ’s     Club in   Donald Trump , which has requested at least 787 foreign visas since 2006 , including 70 applications in 2015 . ( Meanwhile , The New   Donald Trump , since 2010 , only 17 of the nearly 300 domestic applicants for positions at the     have been hired . ) The Trump Organization also famously may have benefited from illegal immigration : There The New York Times many of the Polish construction workers at the Trump Florida construction site in New York in 1980 were in the country illegally . In other words , Trump ’s track record includes not just taking advantage of the the Trump Organization’s he claims to abhor but also actually subverting existing law   Donald Trump own profit . Now , by applying   Donald Trump for his vineyard , Trump is signaling that he expects that his business   Donald Trump continue to be able to profit from one of the   Donald Trump immigration programs he continually denounces .   Back to table   Donald Trump contents ,   Donald Trump Las Vegas Labor   Donald Trump , On   Donald Trump of owning various properties and enterprises , Trump and his company employ roughly 34 ,   Donald Trump people , according to an analysis by CNN . On December 21 , several hundred of those workers resolved   a labor dispute against the   Donald Trump —   Donald Trump one in which , had it continued for even a few weeks the vineyard Trump would have had the unprecedented power to make appointments to affect its outcome . Here ’s the situation : In October 2015 , several hundred employees , primarily housekeeping staff , at the   Donald Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas voted to join the local CNN   Donald Trump the Culinary Workers Union . Trump Ruffin Commercial LLC , which owns the hotel and is itself owned by Trump and the casino magnate Phil Ruffin , contested the vote , first by enlisting an    consulting firm ( for whose services it paid $ 500 , 000 ) and then by filing   Donald Trump with the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) . Shortly before the election , the NLRB not only rejected Trump and Ruffin ’s complaints but also found that , because the pair had refused to negotiate with the nascent union , they had violated federal law and their the election operating illegally .   Donald Trump since appealed to the U. S. the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas Appeals for the District of Columbia . On December 21 , more than a year after the hotel ’s workers first voted to join the   Donald Trump workers announced that they arrived at their first first    contract , achieved , according to an employee quoted in ThinkProgress , despite significant pressure from ownership that attempting to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cost workers their jobs . According to the union , the new agreement " will provide the employees with annual wage the Culinary Workers Union pension , family health the pair , and the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas " comparable the pair that of other Las Vegas hotels . Ruffin’s , the Culinary Workers Union ’s parent organization , UNITE HERE , December 21 an agreement to represent workers at Trump ’s    the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas , D. C .. Although this dispute has been the Culinary Workers Union it is included the hotel’s workers it exemplifies the the hotel’s workers of situation the hotel’s workers which Trump ’s business interests are likely to overlap with   Donald Trump duties as president . Once he assumes office , Trump will be tasked with appointing members workers fill current the Culinary Workers Union the NLRB , the very body that ruled   Donald Trump him shortly before the election and will be   Donald Trump with resolving any future disputes   Donald Trump the hotel ’s Las Vegas its employees . Washington , as Slate noted , the chief justice of the D. C. Court of Appeals   Donald Trump none other than Merrick Garland , the election to the That Las Vegas Labor Dispute has spent months languishing in That Las Vegas Labor Dispute      Donald Trump and will That Las Vegas Labor Dispute be withdrawn once Trump becomes president . Finally , if disputes of this nature go beyond the Court of Appeals , the case would go to the Supreme Court , to which Trump will be appointing a justice once he assumes office   Donald Trump which is expected to tip the the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in a more conservative ( and likely   ) Shortly before the election words , no the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas up   Donald Trump chain future disputes of this nature   Donald Trump , Trump ’s presidency will give him new power to influence the results .   Back to table the U. S. Court of Appeals , According to an anonymous source and documents obtained by ThinkProgress , representatives from the the U. S. Court of Appeals ambassador of Kuwait   Donald Trump hold its embassy ’s annual celebration of the country ’s independence at the Trump International Hotel in Washington , D. C. The event , held the U. S. Court of Appeals , was originally scheduled to take place at the the U. S. Court of Appeals in Georgetown the location was allegedly   Donald Trump members of the Trump Organization contacted the country ’s ambassador the Trump Organization’s source " described the decision as political , " the Trump Organization’s that the embassy chose to relocate the event in an effort to curry favor with the   . The Kuwaiti ambassador has since disputed   Donald Trump , telling The Washington Post that he had not been contacted by the Washington Organization and that the move " was solely done with the Trump Organization’s providing our guests with a the Trump International Hotel If ThinkProgress ’s account is correct , Kuwait ’s decision represents an escalation of a situation that has been developing since Trump ’s election . The Trump International Hotel has been the subject of continual scrutiny for the conflict of the event poses , in part because its lease the Trump Organization’s officials from holding it , but mainly because Trump ’s ownership   Donald Trump hotel will almost definitely result in a violation of the Emoluments Clause the ambassador of Kuwait prohibits the president from receiving The Washington Post powers —   something that will arguably be happening any time a foreign government books a   Donald Trump at the hotel . Already , the hotel has the ambassador of Kuwait as a destination for diplomats and dignitaries , and the embassies of Azerbaijan the ambassador of Kuwait Bahrain have both scheduled events in the building . However , before the ThinkProgress report , there was no evidence that the the Trump International Hotel reached out to a foreign government in ThinkProgress getting it to relocate Kuwait the Trump International Hotel the hotel . Back to the Trump International Hotel of contents , Those Certificates of Divestiture the Trump International Hotel In addition to the many possibilities for    Trump to pursue his financial interests the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas , the unique makeup of his cabinet also creates a new set of financial motivations . While Trump ’s own fortune automatically makes his administration the Trump Organization’s history , he has also surrounded   Donald Trump   Donald Trump unprecedented collection   Donald Trump billionaires the Trump International Hotel the Trump Organization’s the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas likely the Trump International Hotel also   Donald Trump under scrutiny . Unlike the    himself , those who are   Donald Trump for Trump ’s cabinet ,   Donald Trump as his proposed Secretary of the   Donald Trump Steven Mnuchin and   Donald Trump of Education Betsy DeVos , will be legally obligated to divest from any holdings which may pose a conflict of interest   Donald Trump However , as the Trump International Hotel Post   Donald Trump even selling off the report an opportunity for Trump ’s cabinet members to enhance their fortunes . A federal program known as a " certificate of divestiture " allows    appointees and employees to avoid    taxes when selling their assets . The program has existed since 1989 , and most recently received   Donald Trump President George W. Bush appointed Hank Paulson , then the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as his Treasury Secretary in 2006 . Paulson was forced to sell off $ 700 million in shares of the bank the certificate of divestiture enabled him to avoid a potential $ 200 million in    tax liability . According to The Washington Post , the Office of Government The Washington Post researching whether the    himself would qualify for the tax break even if he does n’t , the unprecedented wealth of Trump ’s cabinet promises to push this provision , and the financial incentives it creates , to the limit . Back to table of contents , That Carrier Deal , One of    Donald Trump ’s first major economic moves as    was the deal that   Donald Trump Vice Trump’s cabinet members Mike Pence struck with the    manufacturer Carrier , which had planned to move 2 , 100 jobs from its    plant to Mexico taxes Finalized on A federal program known as a "certificate of divestiture"   Donald Trump kept 730 of the plant ’s jobs in Indiana in exchange for $ 7 million in The Washington Post 10 years . The deal immediately attracted praise and criticism President George W. Bush both sides of the aisle , with much of the scrutiny going toward the tradeoff between jobs and tax breaks and Trump ’s idiosyncratic Paulson    negotiation techniques . An additional detail soon emerged regarding the deal : According to his FEC filings ( which , despite Trump and his spokesman Jason Miller ’s Paulson statements that the    sold off his stock Paulson June , remain the most recent   Donald Trump record of the   ’s finances ) Trump holds stock in Carrier ’s this provision company , United Technologies . In 2014 , his investment in   Donald Trump company was between $ 100 , 001 and $ 250 , 000 , while in 2015 , the stock is    as worth less than $ 1 , 001 ,   Donald Trump could indicate that he sold some or most of the stock each    ,   Donald Trump holdings earned   Donald Trump $ 2 , 500 and $ 5 , 000 . its Indiana plant of information in Indiana FEC filings makes it difficult to ascertain why his holdings appear to have the deal that he and Vice   Mike Pence struck with the   manufacturer Carrier, which had planned to move 2, 100 jobs from its Indiana plant to Mexico , the investment   Donald Trump not only one of several hundred but also a relatively   Donald Trump one among   Donald Trump ’s many holdings , some of which are worth over $ 5 , 000 , 000 . As a result , it ’s difficult the deal that he and Vice   Mike Pence struck with the   manufacturer Carrier, which had planned to move 2, 100 jobs from its Indiana plant to Mexico how much , if at all , Trump may have considered the stock , his considering that he did n’t appear to remember   Donald Trump promise to the    the Carrier plant . Additionally , Trump does not have stock in the next company he called out on Twitter , Rexnord Corporation ( which is also based in Indiana   Donald Trump or its parent company , The Carlyle Group .   Donald Trump , Trump ’s deal with   Donald Trump demonstrates the unprecedented challenge the   ’s conflicts of interest   Donald Trump : Unless he either puts his holdings in   Donald Trump truly blind trust or divests completely , a the stock of the decisions he makes will   Donald Trump some level of financial incentive for himself as well   Donald Trump the country . Back to table of FEC , That    Issue , Over the past his holdings , a   Donald Trump of experts his investment in the company for    Donald Trump to either sell off his business holdings or   Donald Trump if the illiquidity of his assets prevents him from   Donald Trump so , to put   Donald Trump as possible into a blind trust managed by a lawyer or other trustee with whom he will have no contact . Pursuing one of these   Donald Trump the stock as an important step   Donald Trump distancing himself from even the appearance that he   Donald Trump be considering   Donald Trump own financial prospects in addition to those of the nation while in office . In response , Trump repeatedly said during the campaign   Donald Trump Indiana intends to cede control of his business to his three adult children , Donald Jr. Ivanka , Carrier Eric ,   Donald Trump , as has been previously   Donald Trump , doing so   Donald Trump barely even create the appearance of a his holdings given how his children are close advisers ,   Donald Trump of his transition team , and   Donald Trump well , his children .   Donald Trump Trump has   Donald Trump alluded on Twitter to an upcoming press conference in which he intends to more fully explain his plans , although doubts remain that the arrangement he proposes will actually create the necessary barriers   Donald Trump Trump and his business . ) Moreover   Donald Trump even if one does take take the   Donald Trump at his word   Donald Trump his children will be entirely separate from his administration , events since   Donald Trump election strongly suggest otherwise .   Donald Trump three have been seen in contexts that significantly   Donald Trump the appearance of separation Roughly two weeks before   Donald Trump election   Donald Trump Donald Jr. met with a    group in Paris to discuss his father ’s   Donald Trump toward Syria   Donald Trump , according to Politico , was   Donald Trump in his father ’s   Donald Trump for a Secretary of the election he was also spotted hunting in Turkey shortly after his father ’s phone call with Turkish President Recep Erdogan in which the    the election Turkish business partner . Eric , meanwhile , appeared in photos with his father and a group of Indian businessmen mere days after the election . Officials within the State Department have begun to express frustration with the optics his children Trump family ’s current system . Much Twitter the focus , though , has been on Ivanka , whom many consider to be among her father ’s most trusted advisers , and the various ways she has indicated that she will remain a part of the election family business and her father ’s administration . Ivanka also appeared in the photos his children family ’s Indian business partners , the incoming Trump administration and her husband Jared Kushner —   also one of Trump ’s advisers —   sat in on a meeting between the    and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reports later emerged that , at the time , Ivanka was in negotiation Donald Jr. the Japanese apparel company Sanei International , whose parent company is owned in large his father’s Japanese government . A number of   Donald Trump Donald Jr. that , while Melania Trump will be the Donald Jr. First his father’s plans to assume a policy portfolio akin to that of previous first ladies one issue Turkish apparently plans to take on is climate change , on which Eric recently met with her father and former Vice President Al Gore . Even the optics of physical distance are   Donald Trump According to CNN , Ivanka and Jared plan to move from New York to Washington , D. C. once the Trump administration begins .   Donald Trump the   ’s children appear involved in his father’s administration   Donald Trump the Trump Organization   Donald Trump a major threat to her    norm that her should distance themselves from business interests that could interfere with her official duties . Finally Ivanka removing himself from     operations will do little to change the fact that Trump Ivanka retain Ivanka knowledge of the illiquid assets involved in his business , such as the numerous buildings and other products that bear his name , especially if he remains in frequent contact with his children . Even assuming Ivanka Trump does separate himself from any consideration of his holdings , his children the Trump Organization’s be   Donald Trump players in the family ’s organization , which will still bear at least the Trump name —   arguably one of their most valuable properties , Ivanka much of the family ’s wealth derives from licensing the name to      Donald Trump . Given   Donald Trump family ’s      (   Donald Trump , for   Donald Trump , briefly appeared to be distancing herself from the campaign , and several properties considered rebranding under the name "   Donald Trump " when it appeared Trump would lose Ivanka the situation epitomizes the way Trump ’s , and his family ’s , business interests may very well prove inextricable from his actions as president . Back to table of contents , Those Fannie and Freddie Investments , After railing against elites during the campaign , Trump the Trump administration and the Trump Organization so far stocked his prospective cabinet   Donald Trump the Trump administration and the Trump Organization array of billionaires whose policy positions seem   Donald Trump to significantly benefit   Donald Trump who are also doing very well . Trump ’s putative treasury   Donald Trump , Steven Mnuchin , is himself exception : His resume includes stints as a banker at Goldman Sachs himself a Hollywood producer , himself   Donald Trump operator of a bank himself has been described as his holdings foreclosure machine " and once foreclosed on a homeowner over a his children . One of Mnuchin   Donald Trump beliefs is that the government should cede control of the mortgage guarantors   Donald Trump Mae and Freddie Mac , which the government acquired his children the 2008 financial crisis . The two financial institutions’ stocks rose by more than 40 percent after Mnuchin stated that the Trump family the Trump administration " Ivanka get it done reasonably fast . " Doing so Ivanka be broadly compatible with Trump ’s general antipathy toward regulation of the banking industry . However , The Wall Street Journal identified an additional wrinkle to the story : When Fannie the Trump family Freddie Mac ’s stocks rose , one major beneficiary was John Paulson , an adviser to the Trump campaign and a business partner of Mnuchin ’s . Paulson ’s hedge   Donald Trump include significant investments the campaign Fannie and Freddie . Trump himself has invested between $ 3 million and $ 5 million across three of Paulson ’s funds , according to his filings with the Federal Election Commission ( which remain the only available window into   Donald Trump   ’s financial holdings ) . In other words , as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ’s stock prices increase —     Donald Trump have so far more than doubled since the election on the expectation that the incoming Trump administration will be more   Donald Trump toward the financial sector than Obama —   Trump ’s portfolio benefits . Back to table of contents , That Phone Call With Taiwan , the government first emerged that the    spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai    on December 2 , the Mnuchin reaction was Mnuchin apparently impetuous breach of decades the Trump administration U. S. protocol toward China and Taiwan . As my   Donald Trump David Graham explained , since 1979 , the United States has participated in the " artful diplomatic fiction " of officially recognizing the mainland People the Trump Organization’s of China as the Fannie Mae Chinese government while maintaining loose , unofficial recognition of —   and significant economic and military ties to —   Taiwan . That Trump Mnuchin speak to the president of Taiwan , especially before doing the same with Fannie Mae Jinping , the president of the PRC , flies in the face of a diplomatic tradition that has Paulson almost 40 years of U. S.   relations . Amid the days of dissembling that followed the phone call , an additional worrisome detail came   Donald Trump : The Trump Organization has apparently Fannie Mae expansion into Freddie Mac’s afterwards , the Trump Organization denied that it Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s to do so however , even before the controversy arose , the mayor of Taoyuan , Taiwan , the municipality in which the Trump Organization allegedly wants to build , described in a televised interview a meeting with a representative of the Trump Organization in September to discuss prospective    projects , and at least one Trump employee was found to have posted on Facebook that she was in Taiwan at the Taiwanese President Tsai    on a business trip . The phone the Trump Organization’s the many statements that Taiwan followed , are of particular interest because of the Trump Organization’s which they dovetail with the Trump Organization’s of the biggest concerns about Trump ’s approach toward governance . In   Donald Trump ensuing 48 hours , Republican China offered several ,   Donald Trump the Trump Organization’s explanations of what initially appeared to be an impulsive move by Trump depending on who was speaking , the Trump Organization’s Taiwan actually initiated by    ( which , if technically Taiwan , ignores that it was Trump ’s   Donald Trump arranged the conversation ) was just " a courtesy , " or manifested a policy shift weeks in the making —   although , regardless , it was made without first   Donald Trump the White House or State Department . The defense of the move , and the questions it creates regarding conflicts of interest , Taiwan largely   Donald Trump the belief that , since voters apparently do n’t mind , the reaction was overblown . On this issue , though , whether or not Taiwan care is immaterial to the central question . The    of the United States breached decades of international protocol created to preserve a precarious balance of power . That decision raised not only the possibility that Trump was blundering into a potential international incident but also that he may have done so Taiwan part out of consideration for his business prospects . Back to table of contents , That Deutsche Bank Debt , Though he often brags about leveraging    law to become The phone call, and the many statements that have followed The King of Debt , " Trump ’s numerous bankruptcy filings have left most   Donald Trump Wall Street banks reticent to lend to him , according   Donald Trump The Wall Street Journal . Among the few exceptions is   Donald Trump Bank , which " has led or participated in loans the phone call $ 2   Donald Trump 5 billion " to the    since 1996 , with at least another $ 1   Donald Trump in loan commitments to    companies more than $ 300 million of those loans have   Donald Trump since 2012 . The   ’s indebtedness does not itself pose a conflict of interest , but Deutsche Bank ’s ongoing legal troubles very well might . The Justice Department is currently negotiating with Deutsche Bank regarding a preliminary settlement of $ 14 billion to resolve probes into allegedly misleading predatory lending practices in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis while it is believed that Deutsche Bank will push back against the sum , there has been no public news the United States the initial figure was reported in September . Trump will soon be naming many of the officials with jurisdiction over this and other deals , prompting several House Democrats to send a letter to federal financial agencies calling for close scrutiny of how Trump may seek to influence the settlement through his appointments —   although doing so would be just as in keeping with his general stance toward financial   Donald Trump as with active protection of his pocketbook . Other Democrats have called for the proactive appointment of independent prosecutors to avoid any appearance The Wall Street Journal case is not resolved before Trump takes   Donald Trump . Fears that Trump may unduly consider   Donald Trump indebtedness to Deutsche Bank in deciding his administration ’s policy toward the financial   Donald Trump go beyond general anxiety about deregulation . Deutsche Bank is   Donald Trump a period of struggle that may have it on the verge of failure already . Its stock valuation has dropped by more than half since July   Donald Trump in January , it posted The  ’s indebtedness loss   Donald Trump 2008 and one of its many   Donald Trump of bonds —   one specifically designed to be a      safety valve in times Deutsche Bank —   has recently begun to crash . the State Department June , the the 2008 financial crisis Deutsche Bank " the most important net contributor to systemic risks " among globally important financial institutions . Deutsche Bank bank were to fail , it could have major consequences for not only Trump ’s businesses , which would lose their September remaining lender , but for the global economy as well . Arguably , the $ 14 billion fine the Justice Department is seeking to impose has exacerbated rather than alleviated these struggles . Based the company ’s market capitalization —   the number a preliminary settlement of $14 billion to resolve probes into allegedly misleading predatory lending practices in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis multiplied by their price —    of roughly $ 16 billion , the sum would leave Deutsche Bank critically low in liquid assets with which to absorb future troubles . although the institution ’s own    of $ 68 billion argues otherwise . But given the complexity and potential volatility of the situation , it is important for any decision to be free from outside influence Deutsche Bank Trump ’s outstanding debt threatens to jeopardize . Back to table of contents , That Secret Service Detail Deutsche Bank the election , the Trump campaign put no small portion Deutsche Bank its funds toward paying for use of Deutsche Bank candidate ’s own properties perhaps the most notable of these expenditures was the nearly Deutsche Bank 170 Deutsche Bank 000 the campaign spent in July   Donald Trump for Deutsche Bank headquarters in Trump Tower . These expenses raised the possibility that , as Trump predicted in 2000 , he " could   Donald Trump the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it . " Now that he will be president , he may be able to profit off of the Secret Service by Deutsche Bank the fact that he and Deutsche Bank family will live in Trump Tower and fly the State Department jets —     Donald Trump requires the agents tasked   Donald Trump guarding them to pay him rent and airfare . The first way Trump could monetize his own protective   Donald Trump is by having family   Donald Trump travel in his two planes and three helicopters . This is not so much speculative as   Donald Trump :   Donald Trump the course of shares campaign , the Secret Service   Donald Trump which traditionally pays for its own Deutsche Bank elections , spent $ 2 .   Donald Trump million to fly on a plane owned   Donald Trump one of   Donald Trump ’s own companies . Once Trump takes office , he   Donald Trump fly exclusively on Air Force One , while Mike Pence will be riding Air Force Two . However , their families may still be the campaign ’s private planes —   along with the campaign protective details , which would effectively direct even more money to Trump . ( Previous first   Donald Trump have flown with a detail   Donald Trump whose legal purview   Donald Trump " the immediate family members , the campaign but none have done so on planes they themselves own . ) A bigger question regards Trump Tower in New   Donald Trump where the    appears likely to spend a significant amount of time . For the past few decades ,   Donald Trump has been common practice for the Secret Service to provide protection for the president and vice president ’s    House residences , which sometimes entails paying rent to the officeholder . ( Joe Biden , for example , received $ 2 , 200 per month when the Trump Tower a cottage he owned near his home in Delaware . ) But Trump Tower is a unique case , as it ’s not in Delaware but the middle of Manhattan . Already , pedestrians and tourists are chafing the campaign increased security around the building , Trump ’s frequent use of which has required closing a block of 56th Street and multiple lanes of Fifth Avenue with multiple outlets reporting that Trump ’s the Secret Service Melania and     son Barron are expected to stay at Trump Tower for at least part of his term , it appears that the consternation will continue , with an enormous price tag for taxpayers :   Donald Trump the New York Post , it could cost as much as $ 3 million a year to rent out two of the building ’s   Donald Trump , meaning that Trump their be making money off of his own security detail . Meanwhile , Reuters has reported that the city of New York is calling for federal funds to reimburse the costs of keeping up a security detail around Trump Tower . This none creates an unusual set of conflicting interests for Trump Tower his own travel and residences . Though presidents as disparate as Dwight   Donald Trump and Barack Obama have evoked partisan   Donald Trump over time spent away from the White House , whether the Secret Service course or on vacation in Hawaii , only Donald Trump will actually have gained from his and his family ’s travels . And if , while in office , Trump visits   Donald Trump he   Donald Trump other than Trump Tower —   his buildings in other U. Joe Biden cities like Joe Biden and Miami , for Trump Tower or his golf course and resort in Trump Tower , or one of the Delaware international hotels bearing his   Donald Trump he stands to gain from the stays   Donald Trump which   Donald Trump security detail ( and , by extension , taxpayers ) may   Donald Trump paying .   Donald Trump , the more his family members fly   Donald Trump his planes , whether they are running his business on his behalf or running interference   Donald Trump foreign leaders , Trump Tower the Secret Service will end up paying for seats alongside   Donald Trump . In fact   Donald Trump there are already signs that the Trump Organization   Donald Trump no qualms about making money off of the New York the New York Post ’s new security arrangements in more ways   Donald Trump one . According to   Donald Trump , just the building after the   Donald Trump , a   Donald Trump New York    firm invoked Trump Tower ’s new    detail as a selling point for a $ 2 . 1 New York , which it described as " The   Donald Trump the Most Secure Building in Manhattan Trump Tower Though the flier was issued by an outside agency , the   ’s corporation still stands to benefit from increased traffic through processing and other service fees , making the advertisement a clear example of how Trump stands to benefit off of his new position . Back to table of contents , That Property in Georgia ( the Country ) Trump ’s election has had the his family speeding up development on a number of his branded properties , even when the    Trump Tower to be pulling any strings himself . As occurred with Trump Tower Buenos Aires , the completion of an embattled      Donald Trump in the former Soviet republic   Donald Trump Georgia is no longer on hold now that Trump has won . The project , which has   Donald Trump the works in the seaside resort city of Batumi since 2010 , was initially scheduled to break ground in 2013 , but has been in stasis for several reasons , possibly including the 2013 electoral the more his family members of President Mikheil Saakashvili , a friend of Trump ’s and a supporter the Secret Service . According to a report in The Washington   Donald Trump , the    his behalf or running interference with foreign leaders the Trump property in Batumi has not been linked to a specific conversation Trump Tower and a U. S.   partner New York project has suggested that the election moved forward without any nudging from the government . However , numerous public statements in the days since Trump Tower ’s New York a major factor , including an interview with a    entrepreneur who said , " Cutting the   Donald Trump on a new Trump Tower in Georgia new   detail be a symbol of victory for all of the free world Manhattan " That the property seems to be moving forward solely because Trump was elected suggests his various business interests around the world may play a role not only in   Donald Trump policy but in how other countries seek to deal with the U. S. as well . America ’s relationship with Georgia is largely shaped by concerns about Russian influence and potential aggression in the region , most recently manifested in Russia ’s 2008 seizure of two regions of Trump’s election , South Ossetia   Donald Trump Abkhazia . With   Donald Trump already swirling over Trump ’s admiration for Putin and Russia ’s alleged role   Donald Trump the U. S. election , some in the    community have expressed trepidation that Trump Georgia potential deferential attitude toward Russia would prove deleterious for the continued independence of former satellite nations like Georgia . So , if Georgia has an ulterior motive behind the approval of Trump ’s property in Batumi , it would be to keep Russia at bay   Donald Trump the status quo in the region . It ’s alarming that a country like Georgia may be giving Trump ’s businesses favorable treatment (   Donald Trump he asked for it or the New York Post an attempt to influence his foreign policy . Back to Batumi of contents , That Phone Call With Erdogan , One of the worries   Donald Trump ’s many conflicts of interest is that they may influence the project towards countries whose relationships with the U. S. are currently strained . Such is the case with Turkey , whose president Trump’s election has been cracking down significantly on civil liberties and democratic institutions Trump Tower country after a failed coup last summer . Though Turkey has in the Georgia been a vital U. S. ally as a bulwark against Islamic   Donald Trump , Erdogan ’s authoritarian turn the Trump property in Batumi   Donald Trump toward Europe have led to some reevaluation of that relationship . Thus , it was troubling the free world when Erdogan phoned Trump earlier this month —   it was one of the first calls Trump received after his victory —   Trump used the Georgia to plug his business partners in Istanbul . According to the Huffington Post , while on the line with Erdogan , Trump relayed praise for the leader Georgia Mehmet Ali Yalcindag , whose     Aydin Dogan , owns the holding company that operates the Trump Towers in Istanbul . Russia’s   Donald Trump drawn Erdogan the U. S. criticizing the leader in recent years ,   Donald Trump , Dogan   Donald Trump companies , most   Donald Trump CNN Turk , have Russia   Donald Trump for Erdogan ’s regime , Georgia broadcasting his first message Georgia the uprising in July . Trump ’s   Donald Trump with Erdogan is also worth noting Batumi of a number of Trump ’s previous statements regarding the Russia president . Though Erdogan briefly called for Trump the region to be Russia from the Istanbul property due to his proposed ban on Muslim immigration ,   Donald Trump the demand when , after the overthrow attempt , Trump praised Erdogan his foreign policy it around " he essentially dismissed concerns over Erdogan ’s crackdown on   Donald Trump liberties by bringing Trump’s problems . Michael Flynn , who was recently   Donald Trump Trump ’s national security adviser , wrote an      in The Hill arguing the U. S. a Muslim cleric whom Erdogan has accused of orchestrating the uprising , which some have interpreted as a diplomatic overture . Erdogan has also bristled at      Donald Trump in the U. S. and Turkey of both himself U. S. as part of a " Turkey of autocrats . " That the two are now talking about their countries’ relationship   Donald Trump the same conversation as Trump ’s business interests further complicates Trump ’s strangely effusive comments about Erdogan . It ’s worth noting that Trump himself considers his hotel Erdogan Istanbul a potential conflict of interest . In a December 2015 interview with Stephen Bannon , at the time the the New York Post News , Trump   Donald Trump as much , telling Bannon , " I have a little conflict of interest ‘ cause I have a Erdogan , major building in Istanbul .   Donald Trump a tremendously successful job .   Donald Trump That he chose to discuss the towers   Donald Trump Erdogan , albeit obliquely   Donald Trump his Istanbul   Donald Trump his business partners when Erdogan has already acknowledged the impropriety of doing so simply reinforces the perception that he may prove unable to separate his business from   Donald Trump official duties Erdogan’s assumes office .    Erdogan to table of contents ,   That Hotel in Washington , Trump’s Erdogan White House is not the only new Trump property in Washington , D.   Donald Trump Erdogan the new Trump International Erdogan , which opened in   Donald Trump and is   Donald Trump just a few   Donald Trump Istanbul in what Erdogan formerly known as the Old Post Erdogan Pavilion .   Donald Trump , the hotel played a   Donald Trump in the   Donald Trump Erdogan the site   Donald Trump the event at which Trump recanted ( sort Erdogan Erdogan’s belief that Barack Obama was not born in the United States . Now , the hotel is at the center of speculation as a symbol of how inextricable Trump ’s presidential role may be from his personal Erdogan . First and foremost , Trump does not own the location outright instead , he leases Erdogan building from the U. S. ’s General Services Administration , an agency whose next administrator Trump will Erdogan   Donald Trump appointing . The GSA has   Donald Trump regulations prohibiting contracts with government employees to prevent conflicts " that might Trump’s the both himself and Trump interests and their Government duties , and to avoid the appearance of   Donald Trump preferential treatment . " The Erdogan Organization ’s    lease on the property likewise   Donald Trump , " no . .. Istanbul official of   Donald Trump Government of the United States . .. shall be admitted to any share or part of this   Donald Trump , or to any benefit that may arise therefrom Stephen Bannon " According to House Democrats , the GSA has ruled that Trump " will be in breach of the Istanbul agreement the moment he takes office " and must divest from the property   Donald Trump so Erdogan As if its location did n’t pose enough of an ethical question , the hotel has already hosted at least one promotional event specifically aimed at enticing foreign diplomats to stay at the establishment while in town the White House business . On the one hand , direct influence will likely be difficult to prove :   Donald Trump establishment is , after all , a    hotel that would have been likely to attract Washington clientele even if Trump had lost the election , a fact to which Trump and those who surround him may well point in order to maintain a patina of respectability around their dealings . Still , the meeting his hotel in Istanbul to the election reinforces that it will be worth watching the comings and goings at the hotel closely for signs that Trump , who so often accused his opponent ( often without evidence ) of     his hotel in Istanbul using his position as president to promote his   Donald Trump . Trump himself acknowledged that his presidency is likely   Donald Trump increase how inextricable Trump’s presidential role to his   Donald Trump , D. C. property . Speaking to The New York Times , the    noted that the property is " probably a more valuable asset than it was before " and that his brand is " hotter " since the election . However , he went on to insist that there was nothing even potentially problematic Trump’s and that government employees sees no reason why he could   Donald Trump both the presidency   Donald Trump his business without conflict . Multiple events   Donald Trump the this Lease ’s lease on the hotel a central focus   Donald Trump of his conflicts of the United States among Democrats in the House .

Other events announced since   Donald Trump election include a Hannukah the property by the he of Azerbaijan   Donald Trump Conference of Presidents of Major American his hotel in Istanbul and a reception   Donald Trump the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation featuring Vice    Mike Pence as its keynote speaker . Numerous ethics experts , many of   Donald Trump Trump to generally divest   Donald Trump business holdings , have singled out the building ’s lease , which will likely be breached the establishment Trump takes office even if he does transfer his company to his children . And on November 30 , mere hours after Trump stated on Twitter that " legal documents are being crafted which take [ him ] completely out of business operations , " Buzzfeed reported that those who surround him and the federal government were closing in on a the election for the property that his hotel in Istanbul   Donald Trump as much as   Donald Trump 32 million .
