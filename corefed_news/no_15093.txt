Let ’s start here : Presidents     all of Presidents         are entitled to some leisure time .    For the last two presidents , the last two presidents preferred leisure time has been spent primarily playing golf . Which , again , is totally fine ! Being president , in case you might not be able to guess , is a very stressful job . You need ways to blow off steam . Given that , the fact that President Donald Trump has made 16 visits to President Donald Trump own golf courses since being sworn in should n’t be a huge deal . President Donald Trump has n’t played golf on every one of these visits     we do n’t know exactly what President Donald Trump ’s doing , due the fact that the White House releases very few details about President Donald Trump trips     but President Donald Trump ’s been photographed actually playing golf on a number of those occasions , including Sunday . The problem for Trump is     and stop me if you ’ve heard this one before     the fact that President Donald Trump was very , very outspoken about the number of rounds of golf that President Barack Obama played during President Barack Obama time in the White House . President Barack Obama , as many Democrats are quick to note , did n’t play President Barack Obama first round of golf until later this month in 2009     at almost the    mark of President Barack Obama presidency . ( According to Mark Knoller , CBS ’s Mr. Know Everything when it comes to his presidency , President Barack Obama wound up playing 333 rounds of golf during President Barack Obama eight years as president . ) And then there is the fact that Trump promised on the campaign trail that he Trump n’t be golfing if he Trump elected president because he Trump be too busy cutting great deals on behalf of the American people . " I ’m going to be working for you . I ’m ’m going to have time to go play golf , " Trump Trump in August 2016 on the campaign .   If he Trump did play golf , Trump Trump , he Trump n’t just play with his Trump like Obama did , but rather use the golf course as a sort of outdoor board room     playing with foreign leaders , members of Congress and the like to convince them his buddies like Obama something or other related to the running of the country . " I mean he Trump played more golf than most people on the PGA Tour , this guy , " Trump Trump in his Trump campaign appearance on November 7 in New Hampshire . " What is it , over 300 rounds ? Hey , look , it it good . Golf is fine . But always play with leaders of countries and people that can help us most people on the PGA Tour Do n’t play with your friends all the time . " It ’s hard to tell whether Trump Trump stuck to that pledge . We know he Trump golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a visit to     in February . But his Trump keep a lid on virtually all information about what Trump Trump when he Trump his Trump golf courses reporters are forced to scour social media looking for hints of who he Trump with ( or if he Trump at all ) . The point of this all is that Trump Trump made the bed he Trump currently lying in . Had he Trump nothing about his Trump ’s leisure habits , there ’d be no stories     or , at least , a whole lot fewer stories     about his Trump love of the links . But since Trump Trump Obama relentlessly for his Obama outings , it ’s difficult to turn around and say that it mattered for Obama Obama not for him Trump Golf is just golf . But , it Golf a reminder that Trump Trump n’t really believe that what ’s good for the goose is good for the gander . He Trump no apparent hypocrisy in railing against Obama Obama    while playing even more golf himself .   Welcome to the wonderful world of contradictions that is President Trump .
