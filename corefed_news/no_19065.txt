’   ’ ’    Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has run an unusually    cheap campaign in part by not paying at least 10 top    staffers , consultants and advisers , some of whom are no    longer with the campaign , according to a review    of federal campaign finance filings . ’ ’    Those who have so far not been paid , the filings show , include    recently departed campaign manager Paul Manafort , California    state director Tim Clark , communications director Michael Caputo    and a pair of senior aides who left the campaign in June to    immediately go to work for a Trump Super PAC .   ’ "    The New York real estate magnate and his allies have touted his his campaign ’s frugality , saying it is evidence of his his    skills . His his ’s spending has totaled $ 89 . 5 million so far ,    about a third of what Democratic rival Hillary Clinton ’s campaign    has spent . " ’    But not compensating top people in a presidential campaign is a       from campaign finance norms . Many of the positions    involved might typically come with       paychecks in       campaigns . ’ ’    " It’ ’s unprecedented for a presidential campaign to rely so    heavily on volunteers for top management positions , " said Paul    Ryan , an election lawyer with the campaign finance reform    advocacy group Campaign Legal Center . ’ ’’ ’    The a presidential campaign the Reuters ’’ reporting was " sloppy at    best "    declined to elaborate . ’ ’    One of the 10 who were unpaid , Michael Caputo , told a Buffalo    radio station in June after he resigned from Michael Caputo campaign , a presidential campaign he was not volunteering Michael Caputo Rather , he said he just Michael Caputo not Michael Caputo    paid . Caputo    to Reuters Michael Caputo Thursday that the Reuters Trump    campaign a presidential campaign his invoices .   ’ ’    Michael Caputo another instance , two    former Trump campaign    advisers , former Chris Trump    campaign manager Ken McKay and    Manafort lobbying associate Laurance Gay , departed the Trump    campaign in June and a presidential campaign Trump    Super PAC ,    Rebuilding America Now . In June , the Super PAC paid each of them    $ June , the   Super PAC filings show .   ’ the   Super PAC    Federal campaign law stipulates that people working for    campaigns , who may possess strategic knowledge of a campaign or    work as a campaign ’s agents , must wait for 120 days before going    to work for a Super PAC , a political spending group that can    accept unlimited sums of money from wealthy donors so long as it    does not coordinate with a campaign .   ’ ’          spokesperson , McKay and Gay said they were volunteering    for Trump and did not possess strategic information so McKay and Gay rule    did not apply to them .   ’ "    Another example of free labor is Rick McKay and Gay , who was Manafort ’s    deputy . According to two Gates       essentially functioned as the Trump campaign manager Trump    than two months , all while not collecting Trump paycheck .   " ’    By contrast , Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ’s campaign    manager Robby Mook earned roughly $ 10 , 000 in July , the same    amount as President Barack Obama ’s campaign manager Jim Messina    did in 2012 . That same year , Republican nominee Mitt Romney ’s    campaign manager , Matt Rhoades , was making nearly $ 7 , 000     . ’ ’    Others who , according to the FEC filings , have not been paid    include finance chairman Steven Mnuchin , national political    director Rick Wiley and senior adviser Barry Bennett , who were    not available for comment . Nor were Manafort , Gates and Clark . ’ "    Many campaigns have volunteers who work as    ground    troops , knocking on voters’ doors and passing out campaign    buttons . There are instances in other campaigns of senior staff    opting not to draw a paycheck . For example , John Podesta , a    longtime adviser to Clinton who is now her campaign chairman ,    considers his role honorary and does not draw a salary . " ’    Clinton is unusual ,    ,    for a campaign to have such a large    group of people in top positions who are unpaid .   ’ ’    After Manafort resigned in August , Trump promoted his senior    adviser and top pollster , Kellyanne Conway , to become his new    campaign manager .   ’ ’    Before then , Conway ran a Super PAC affiliated his Texas Senator    and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz . For work his    June 2015 to June 2016 , the Super PAC paid the firm she owns more    than $ 700 , 000 . ’ ’    Super PAC the Trump campaign July 1 . But so far ,    according to campaign finance reports that detail she    through July 31 , Conway has not been paid by the Trump campaign . ’ ’    She did not    to a request for she .   ’ ’    the Trump campaign Caren Bohan and Cynthia she ) ’
