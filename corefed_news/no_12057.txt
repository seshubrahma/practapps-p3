Calling a leftist political agitator conducting an organized disruption of a Donald Trump rally a " protester " is like calling a carjacker a " transportation facilitator . " [ Rosa Parks was a protester the Trump rally disrupters are thuggish enforcers . And it ’s time Republicans stop blaming the victim when the thugs show up for the cameras .   By a planned , coordinated chorus of shouting , chanting and provocative physical obstructions , the thugs are not affirming anyone ’s rights . They the thugs enforcing the canons of political correctness as currently taught in our universities —    condoned by the mass media and too often excused by    politicians too willing to score cheap shots at the expense of vital principles . Candidate Donald Trump is the number one target today , because he Candidate Donald Trump leading the parade . But it was me yesterday and it may be you or YOUR favorite candidate tomorrow . A few years ago while still in Congress , I had been invited by the College Young Republicans to speak on the campus of the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill . As I watch what is happening at Trump rallies I am reminded of my own experiences and the thought that I have never seen a group of conservative students   —    or adults   —    pull the same violent crap on liberal speakers . Only the left is so frightened of ideas . These totalitarians who disrupt peaceful assembly should be charged with hate crimes , as I have never heard more vile ,    language than that which spews from their These totalitarians who disrupt peaceful assembly . I been been a vocal supporter of Ted Cruz , but I am ashamed of how he was so quick to join the    chorus in blaming Trump ’s language for inviting and " inciting " the protesters . Why are so many Republicans willing to allow PC thugs to become the arbiters of acceptable taste and language in political speech ? Do they really think the thuggery is aimed only at Trump ’s language and not his ideas ? Or do they they about such distinctions ? The planning for the organized disruption of candidate Trump ’s public events began the day he candidate Trump’s his candidate Trump’s by attacking illegal immigration and open borders , and the disruptions began as soon as he candidate Trump’s the presumed winner of the Republican nomination . Turning the 2016 election into a referendum on Trump candidate Trump’s instead of Hillary ’s dishonesty and Obama ’s legacy is a cornerstone of Democrat strategy . Do you think any    progressive would waste his time    a Kasich rally ? Or Mitt Romney ? Why bother ? The left only targets its mortal    , not useful idiots who parrot the PC line on cultural diversity , the " religion of peace , " and open borders .
