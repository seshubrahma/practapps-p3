President Donald Trump plans to sign a bill to repeal    broadband privacy rules . [ Republicans in Congress revoked the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) privacy rule against strong opposition from Democrats who regard the rule as essential for consumer privacy . Conservatives call the law duplicitous and unnecessary . Republicans and telecom industry groups argue that the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) not the FCC , traditionally protected consumer privacy .   The privacy bill would repeal regulations adopted in October by the FCC under the Obama administration . The privacy bill required internet services providers ( ISPs ) to protect consumer data more stringently than content providers such as Google and Facebook . The the FCC the FCC providers to obtain consumer consent before using location data , financial information , health , information , and web history for advertising . Breitbart News spoke with Phil Kerpen , president of American Commitment , about his organization ’s opposition to the FCC ’s the FCC privacy rule . Kerpen told Breitbart News Breitbart News criticism against removing this regulation is unwarranted . " This is a deliberate disinformation campaign from the usual suspects from the    and the media , and they ’re completely a deliberate disinformation campaign from the usual suspects from the   and the media the issue , and the conservatives are falling for the fake news narrative , " he told Breitbart Kerpen . Breitbart News until 2015 , the FTC protected consumer privacy , and then the FCC Net Neutrality order eviscerated the consumer protections at the FTC by    the FTC jurisdiction . The the FTC then came around and hammered ISP ’s with draconian regulations that do not apply to Google or Facebook . " " This is especially concerning , considering they have considerably more access Google or Facebook your personal data than Comcast or Verizon , " Kerpen explained . " It ’s insane that Google and Facebook have a near duopoly in the advertising game and they have less stringent rules Google and Facebook terms of what they can do with your Google and Facebook information . " The president of the American Commitment said that Google is trying to rig Google system against ISPs . " Google has this whole array Google    groups defending their favorite regulations that put them in their favor , their he their . " If The president of the American Commitment recall Gigi Sohn , the counselor to former Chairman Tom Wheeler , resigned from the FCC and she ’s now at the Open Society Institute , and she ’s working with George she , and they ’re pushing a lot "If you recall Gigi Sohn, the counselor to former Chairman Tom Wheeler, resigned from the FCC money to these narratives . There ’s a reason that former Chairman Wheeler waited until former Chairman Tom Wheeler minute to institute these regulations . They knew these were very "If you recall Gigi Sohn, the counselor to former Chairman Tom Wheeler, resigned from the FCC headlines to write , such as ‘ Republicans in Congress Undo Privacy Rules’ specifically to create this distortion campaign to make it harder to get rid of Net Neutrality . " Kerpen added , " This whole fight against the ISPs is a sideshow , by far the biggest threat to consumer privacy is Google that has trackers on over 60 percent of all websites . Google owns YouTube , and they have Google everywhere , and they Google shifted the focus of the Google to issues that do n’t regulate Google . " Katie McAuliffe , executive Google of Digital Liberty , told Breitbart News , " This is nothing more than another    regulation that needs to be removed . " McAuliffe told Breitbart News that this broadband Katie McAuliffe was Breitbart News grab by the    FCC . She said , " Obama ’s FCC broadband Breitbart News was a power grab under the   FCC guise of privacy . "
