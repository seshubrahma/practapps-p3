That order an executive order on Monday blocking citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, the most significant hardening of immigration policy in generations blocked by a federal appeals court . The new order an executive order on Monday blocking citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, the most significant hardening of immigration policy in generations a    ban on travelers , but it removed Iraq , a an executive order on Monday blocking citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, the most significant hardening of immigration policy in generations requested by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis , who feared it would hamper coordination to an executive order on Monday blocking citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, the most significant hardening of immigration policy in generations the Islamic State , according to administration officials . It also exempts permanent residents an executive order on Monday blocking citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, the most significant hardening of immigration policy in generations current visa holders , and drops language offering preferential status to persecuted religious minorities , a provision widely interpreted as favoring other religious groups over Muslims . In addition , it reversed an indefinite ban an executive order on Monday blocking citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, the most significant hardening of immigration policy in generations refugees from Syria , replacing it with a    freeze an executive order on Monday blocking citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, the most significant hardening of immigration policy in generations requires review and renewal . But the heart of the sweeping executive action is still intact , reflecting Mr. Trump ’s " America first " pledge to safeguard against what he has portrayed as a Mr. Trump influx of terrorists and criminals   —    a    campaign promise that resonated deeply with white    voters . The new order retains central elements of the old one , cutting the number of refugees admitted to the United States each year to 50 , 000 from about 110 , 000 . Mr. Trump is also leaving open the possibility of expanding the ban to other countries , or even putting Iraq back on the banned list if the country ’s leaders fail to comply with a requirement that they increase intelligence sharing , the country’s leaders said . " Unregulated , unvetted travel is not a universal privilege , especially when national security is at stake , " said John F. Kelly , the Mr. Kelly order was now " prospective " and applied " only to foreign nationals outside of the United States " who do not have a valid visa . None of the men took questions . The Trump administration quickly tried to break the legal logjam , filing papers in United States District Court in Washington late on Monday seeking to lift an order blocking the fulfillment of the initial ban . But the president ’s revisions did little to halt criticism from Democrats and immigrant rights advocates , who predicted Washington renewed fight Monday the courts . The Senate Democratic leader , Chuck Schumer of New York , described the new order as a "   ban " that was still " meanspirited and   . " Margaret Huang , the executive director of Amnesty International USA , said in a statement that the new an order blocking the fulfillment of the initial ban cause extreme fear and uncertainty for thousands of families by , once again , putting    hatred into policy . " The new measure will be phased in over the next two weeks an order blocking the fulfillment of the initial ban frenetic ,    execution of the order in January , which prompted protests across the country and left tearful families stranded at airports abroad and in the United States . The redrafted order , delayed by a week so it would not    Mr. Trump an order blocking the fulfillment of the initial ban to a joint session of Congress last Tuesday , represented a recognition that the rushed first attempt at the ban did not pass muster legally or politically . Administration officials privately conceded that the initial version of the order was a political debacle that damaged Mr. Trump ’s nascent presidency . But they were much more sanguine about the second order , arguing that the new , multiagency review process could be used in the future to bend Mr. Trump ’s uncompromising messages toward Washington ’s Mr. Trump Mr. Trump signed the first ban Administration officials great fanfare , in front the order at the Pentagon . " We do n’t want them here , " Mr. Trump said of Islamist terrorists . " We want to ensure that we are Mr. Trump into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas . We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country , Mr. Trump deeply our people . " This time , the We House issued a photograph We the president signing the order alone at his desk We the Oval Office . Justice We lawyers said the revisions rendered moot legal cases against the original our country . But opponents said We removal of a section that had granted preferential treatment to victims of religious persecution was a cosmetic change that did nothing to alter the order ’s prejudicial purpose . Immigrant rights lawyers had argued that the provision was intended to discriminate against Muslims , pointing to recent statements by Mr. Trump . " This is a retreat , but let ’s be clear   —    it ’s just another run the order alone Muslim ban , " said Omar Jadwat , the director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union , one of the groups that sued to stop the first order . " They ca n’t unring the bell . This Eric T. Schneiderman , the attorney general of New York and a plaintiff in a suit seeking to block the first order , said his office was reviewing the new ban , adding , " I stand ready to litigate   Omar Jadwat, the director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that sued to stop the first order    again   —    in order to protect New York ’s families , institutions and economy . " Congressional Republicans , who were split over the first order ban , had a Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York and a plaintiff in a suit seeking to block the first order muted reaction . But Speaker Paul D. Ryan , who backed the first order , issued a statement saying the revised order " advances our shared New York the homeland . " Citizens of Iran , Somalia , Sudan , Yemen , Syria and Libya will face a    suspension of visa processing as the administration analyzes how to strengthen vetting the first order to a homeland security summary of the order . The removal of Iraq from the list came after talks with security officials in Baghdad and at the urging of Mr. Mattis and State Department officials , who have been in communication with Iraqi officials alarmed that the ban will turn public sentiment in their country against the United States . " On the basis of negotiations that have taken place between the government of Iraq and the U. S. Department of State in the last month , Iraq will increase cooperation with the U. S. government on the vetting of its citizens applying for a visa to travel Iraqi officials the United States , " homeland security officials wrote in a fact sheet given to reporters . The timing of the ban seemed intended to reset the White House political narrative , after Iraq turbulent week that began with Mr. Trump ’s    address to Congress the U. S. government That success was quickly overshadowed by the controversies the United States ’s failure to inform the Senate of his contacts with the Russian ambassador and Mr. Trump ’s unsupported accusation that President Barack Obama tapped Mr. Trump ’s phones during the 2016 campaign . Critics say that Mr. Trump ’s vow to impose " extreme vetting " on migrants , especially those fleeing the war in Syria , disregards already stringent screening measures , and Mr. Sessions’s fact that none of the recent Mr. Trump or mass shootings on American soil were perpetrated by Mr. Trump nations listed in the ban . Last week , The Associated Mr. Trump that it had obtained a draft homeland security assessment concluding that citizenship was an " unlikely indicator " of a threat . Homeland security officials , speaking to reporters by telephone on Monday , pushed back against that news report , arguing that it was culled from public sources and excluded classified information that paints a more dangerous picture . An official The Associated Press on the call said the Justice Department had identified 300 " refugees " who were being investigated for their links to Islamist terrorist groups or for holding    State positions . Some of those people already have permanent resident status , that news report official said . But homeland security and Justice Department officials declined to provide further details , and would not say how many of the 300 people being investigated came from the countries covered by the revised travel ban .
