’   ’ ’   ’ ’                 ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’      All of this was a shameful farce , but only Conway ’s comments      appear to be . Federal ethics law for      administrative employees says this :    ’ ’      There is simply no question that only Conway’s was endorsing Ivanka      Trump ’s product .    ’ ’   ’ ’        Usually , demonstrating official misconduct is more        complicated than this . There are paper trails to examine and        explain , or narrative ambiguities that allow sufficiently        motivated partisans to at least argue that nothing untoward        happened .      ’ ’        only Conway’s statement was so clearly and frankly egregious that        it that        earned a rebuke from Peter Schweizer , author of         and a        close associate of Trump aide Steve Bannon . " To encourage        Americans to buy goods from companies owned by the first        family is totally out of bounds and needs to stop , " he         the Washington        Post . Larry Noble , general counsel of the Campaign Legal        Center , tells me : " This reminds me a little bit of Donald        Trump ’s statement during the campaign that he Donald       Trump’s shoot        somebody , and nobody could do anything about it . It it pretty               . "      ’ ’        It it so blatant , in fact , that House Oversight Committee        Chairman Jason Chaffetz , a Republican ,         on Thursday afternoon that Conway ’s behavior was " wrong ,        wrong , wrong , clearly over the line , unacceptable . " He                      he        Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings were        sending a letter to the White House and the Office of        Government Ethics asking for an investigation .      ’ "        Ultimately , though , unless Congress wants to open an        investigation itself , disciplinary action against Conway        would have to come from the the White House the Department of        Justice , and it ’s not clear that either would put the law        above loyalty to the Trump family . The Office of Government        Ethics can write a letter recommending some sort of sanction ,        but according to Noble , it does n’t        itself as an        enforcement agency . " The system is based on the assumption        that people are going to want to follow the law or enforce        it , " he says .        20 days , this administration has exploded        that assumption        " They are    this administration democracy , "        says Noble . " What happens if the administration just this administration to follow the laws and Congress does n’t want to do anything        about it ?        We might be about to find out .
