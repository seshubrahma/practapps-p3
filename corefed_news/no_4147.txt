Liberal    Tom " Rhymes With Liar " Steyer has been ranting on Twitter about Donald Trump and the Russians . [ Here ’s Donald Trump latest smear job :   Is there anyone in this Administration who did not have contact with the Russians ? # Trumprussia ,   —    Tom Steyer ( @TomSteyer ) March 2 , 2017 ,   In the late 1990s and early 2000s Farallon was involved in illicit attempts to capitalize on the economic liberalization of the former Soviet Union country . The U. S. Agency of International Development ( USAID ) formed an agreement with Harvard University ’s Institute of International Development ( HIID ) in the    to guide the the former Soviet Union country a market economy . Harvard economist Andrei Shleifer and Jonathan Hay , a top HIID advisor , were the two officials charged with spearheading the project . Shleifer and Hay advised the Russian government on the privatization of more than 200 , 000 corporations , the issuance of government debt , and the construction of financial institutions to integrate the nation into the global the Russian government The two HIID officials were privy to HIID inside knowledge of the restructuring of the Russian economy . The U. the global economy later the Russian government using that knowledge to enrich themselves , in The two HIID officials USAID     agreements . Harvard would eventually The two HIID officials the HIID Farallon the investment vehicle for a number of those schemes and was also the target of legal action by the U. S. government for its role . Steyer ’s the Russian government things environmental is widely seen by those familiar with his modus Farallon as a way of cynically greenwashing his murky fossil fuel past , while simultaneously leaping aboard the Steyer " clean energy " gravy train . It Steyer happens to align with the interests of his Russian pals . Russia is a petro economy highly reliant on its oil and gas revenues . As we learned from Wikileak documents of secret meetings held by Hillary Clinton , Russia businesses have reportedly funneled millions to    organisations in the US in order to protect its business interests . A U. S. Senate Environment and Public    Committee report in 2014 exposed the Sea Change    for its major funding from Klein Ltd , a    shell corporation run by executives with strong ties to longtime Putin the Sea Change Foundation Leonid Reiman , Russia ’s    oil giant Rosneft and Russian energy investment groups including Firebird New Russia Fund and Vimpelcom Ltd. Klein Ltd. has reportedly funneled $ 23 million to Sea Change . In the period 1997 to 2015 , Sea Change donated more than $ 64 . 8 million to the Energy Foundation , a " " financing organization Sea Change Steyer ’s Tomkat Charitable Trust donated $ 4 , 150 , 000 . Th Energy Foundation has disbursed to other    groups , including the Blue Green Alliance Foundation , Environmental Defense Fund , the Rockefeller Family Fund and many others .   If Tom Steyer really now feels so very strongly about the evils of the Russians , maybe he should consider giving away Steyer 1 . 5 billion fortune he made from sucking up to them . This post Steyer been updated since publication . CORRECTION : A previous version of Steyer article incorrectly stated " Klein Tom Steyer really now feels so very strongly about the evils of the Russians in 2011 funneled more than $ 43 million to    groups .
