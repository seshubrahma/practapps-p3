Pollster and analyst Pat Caddell joined Breitbart New Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Monday to discuss the closing days of the election , including new revelations suggesting collusion between CNN and the Democratic National Committee . [ Breitbart News reported the revelation on Monday : " A new WikiLeaks dump of Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) emails shows CNN asked the party ’s political operatives to draft questions for anchors Wolf Blitzer and Jake Tapper to interview Ted Cruz and Donald Trump . "   Caddell said Monday , " That ’s why [ CNN ] did not want to have an investigation about Donna Brazile —   because Donna Brazile —   know what Donna Brazile —   ’ve all been doing . The media has been blatant . " Caddell also discussed polling Caddell conducted on the issue as part of Breitbart News’ larger political polling initiative . " On the question if this is normal behavior or bias , regardless of how you vote , 64 percent of people have an opinion on this , with about 21 percent undecided , " Caddell said . The majority believe the bias is " so incredible that the bias constitutes a threat to the people ’s right to know , and the bias ’s a threat to democracy , " concluded Caddell , calling the bias " terrifying .
