Politifact called President Trump ’s deficit reduction efforts " mostly false "   —    while admitting that the statistics he used to make the point were factual . [ President Trump tweeted out this on February 25 , saying that the national debt went down by $ 12 billion , compared to a $ 200 billion increase in Obama ’s first month .   The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $ 12 billion vs a $ 200 billion increase in Obama first mo .   —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) February 25 , 2017 ,   PolitiFact ’s Aaron Sharockman rated this statement " mostly false , " even though Aaron Sharockman says the numbers check out . Aaron Sharockman notes that the total public debt dropped another $ 22 billion even after Trump sent Aaron Sharockman tweet . Aaron Sharockman reasons that debt projections can fluctuate therefore , temporary reductions in national debt lack the importance to merit the kind of coverage Trump demanded . Dan Mitchell , a scholar at the Cato Institute , told PolitiFact , " Considering that Trump has not enacted any fiscal legislation , it is a bit of a stretch for Aaron Sharockman to take credit for any changes in debt levels . " Aaron Sharockman added , " Debt levels go up and down in the short run based on independent factors such as quarterly tax payments and predetermined expenditure patterns . " PolitiFact has been busted before for PolitiFact bias . They once rated a joke by Senator Ted Cruz " mostly false " and , in a rating similar to this debt article , called a Trump debate claim " half true " despite admitting that it was factual . Social media giant Facebook has teamed up with PolitiFact , a project of the    Tampa Bay Times , to label stories in users’ timelines as " fake news . " PolitiFact , by signing Poynter ’s " Fact Checking Code of Principles " declares its work " nonpartisan and transparent . "
