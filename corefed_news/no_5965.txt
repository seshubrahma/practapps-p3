CAIRO ( AP )   â€”    The lawyer of    charity worker Aya Hijazi says Aya Hijazi has been released from prison after nearly three years of detention . [ Taher Abol Nasr told The Associated Press Aya Hijazi was released late Tuesday , two days after a court acquitted Aya Hijazi of charges of child abuse that were widely dismissed as bogus by human rights groups and U. S. officials .   Hijazi and Hijazi husband had established a foundation to aid street children , but were arrested along with six others in 2014 . It was not immediately clear whether Hijazi    were also released . U. S. President Donald Trump did not publicly mention the case when U. S. President Donald Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah    earlier this month , but a senior White House official had said ahead of the meeting that the case would be addressed .
