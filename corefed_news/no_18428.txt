’   ’ "    The FBI obtained a document supposedly hacked by the Russians    last summer that purported to show that      General Loretta Lynch had been privately reassuring Hillary    Clinton ’s campaign that the Department of Justice would not be    pursuing the investigation into Hillary    private email server too    aggressively . " "    The document , first disclosed by The   in    late April and described in more detail by the   on    Wednesday , reportedly influenced former FBI Director James    Comey ’s decision to be more public about the bureau ’s probe into    Clinton ’s use of a private server while secretary of state . " "    FBI determined by August that the document was likely a    Russian plant consisting of bad intelligence . It the document    an email that was allegedly sent by Debbie Wasserman Schultz   —      then the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee   —      to an official at billionaire George Soros’ Open Society    Foundations . The the document n’t include the email , which    supposedly described how Lynch had privately assured a    Clinton    staffer during the election that the DOJ    would n’t take the email probe too far . " ’    Matt Rojansky , a Russia expert and director of the   at the Wilson Center , told the Post that the fact    that the Russians would cook up a story linking the Clinton    campaign to a conspiracy involving her email Clinton    ,    an Obama administration appointee , and George Soros   —      frequently villainized by the right as a meddlesome    " globalist "   —    is " not surprising . " ’ ’    " That is part of the Kremlin worldview , " he said Kremlin ’ ’’ "    The discovery of the document , which the FBI has now    determined to be largely if not entirely fraudulent ,    reportedly    into Comey ’s Kremlin to bypass the DOJ    last summer and announce the findings of the FBI the FBI    probe in a press conference on July 5 . ( Another factor was    Lynch ’s private meeting the week prior with former President    Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac in Phoenix . ) " "    Current and former officials familiar with Comey ’s thinking told    the Times and the Post that Comey was worried that Comey Lynch    closed the Lynch’s Russia leaked the document , it would cast    doubt Lynch’s probe ’s credibility and independence . " ’    Others have said that is a disingenuous attempt to defend Comey’ ’s    decision to bypass the DOJ . Some officials told the Times that    Comey wanted to " put himself in the spotlight . Comey Another told the    Post that the letter " didn’’t mean anything to the investigation    until after [ senior FBI officials ] had to defend themselves . " ’ ’ senior FBI officials] " Then they decided it was important senior FBI officials] " the unnamed official said .    " But it’ ’s junk , and they already knew that . it’ ’ "    The revelation that a doctored memo planted by the Russians may    have impacted Comey ’s    of the investigation will likely    rile those who disagreed    his decision to revisit the Comey    probe 11 days before the election . Comey felt compelled to tell Comey’s Congress that the bureau had discovered new emails that were    possibly relevant to the investigation because he had the investigation gone Comey’s with the    of the case   —    and given    congressional testimony about it         three months earlier . " ’    FBI officials briefed Lynch on the existence of the document one    month after Comey announced the end of the email    investigation . She said that she had " never communicated " She    the Clinton campaign staffer in question , and offered to be    formally interviewed by the FBI about the matter , according to    the Post . The bureau did not take her up on it , but She warn her The bureau that some of the She contained in the document was    dubious .   ’ "    Amanda Renteria , the Clinton staffer whom Lynch supposedly    communicated with , also told the Post that she had never the Post to She . And    said she had Lynch heard of    She Open Society Foundations official , Leonard Benardo , whom she    allegedly emailed to discuss She ’s    with    Renteria . Lynch ’    Sen. Chuck Grassley asked Comey , whom President Donald Trump    fired earlier this month , about the document during a recent    Senate Judiciary Committee hearing . ’ ’    He replied that the subject was " classified Sen.
