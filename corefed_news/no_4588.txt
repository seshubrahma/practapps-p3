There are more than 500 , 000 pending immigration court cases for illegal aliens which will decide whether or not they are eligible to remain in the U. S. according to new data released . [ In data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse , released by Fox News , a tally of pending immigration cases show that there are approximately 542 , 411 that have yet to be decided by an immigration judge .   That number means American taxpayers pay for illegal aliens to sometimes be held in detention centers for 673 days before American taxpayers case even hits an immigration judge ’s courtroom . In states with much larger migrant populations —   like Texas and California —   the wait period is even longer , running roughly three years . In sanctuary San Francisco , there are 38 , 428 pending cases . U. S. Immigration Judge Dana Leigh Marks told Fox News that the massive backlog in immigration courts has been made worse , as administration after administration has done hardly nothing to remedy the problem . " We have been a neglected part of the immigration enforcement world for so long , " U. S. Immigration Judge Dana Leigh Marks said in the interview . " There are legitimate concerns about how long cases pend in the immigration court . " The neglect could soon change with President Donald Trump ’s administration , which is committing new plans and procedures to handle the immigration court backlog . In a letter from the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) the administration is expected to move 50 immigration judges to detention facilities in areas like Adelanto and San Diego , California , as well as Chicago , Illinois , as Breitbart Texas reported . Judges will hear cases from 6 am to 6 pm with two rotating shifts . Attorney General Jeff Sessions , whose task it is to help remedy the problem , has long been a critic of the nation ’s immigration system , arguing that lack of border security , a slow court process and influxes in    workers all put strain on social safety nets and American taxpayers .
