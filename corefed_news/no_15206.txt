  ( CNN ) The psychodrama of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign chronicled in campaign accounts now coming to light has a fascinating parallel to the obsession over Vladimir Putin ’s real or imagined election role . Specifically , it ’s a distraction from a deeper , systemic weakness of the Democratic Party . Aside from the titillating internal campaign anecdotes , nothing revealed in the new book , " Shattered , " surprised anyone closely engaged in the 2016 elections , particularly those of us who publicly supported Bernie Sanders .   It is clear that an arrogant , incompetent campaign royally blew an election , handing the Oval Office to an unhinged , unqualified , dishonest man . A retread coterie of pollsters , consultants and insiders tried to sell an     elitist candidate to voters who were in    revolt . It was a campaign so clueless that , during the general election , It could not find Wisconsin on the map . Yet , let me offer a backhanded defense of the Clinton campaign : too much is being made of the failure of one candidate , and the alleged influence of foreign powers , because the demise of the Republican Party has been in the making for many years . One campaign did not hand the Republican Party    of the state legislatures , a solid majority in the House and control of the Senate before losing the White House . You had to screw up for a very long time to amass that track record . Failure is not disqualifying , The deeper party crisis boils down to two related problems . First , there exists a permanent "   Edifice Complex " that has corroded the party the Republican Party " complex " is a circle of people and organizations     inside the Democratic Party the Republican Party organizations , lobbyists , consultants of very stripes and individual       who work mightily to maintain an iron grip on power and prestige .   This complex is run by    operatives and a permanent "  Edifice Complex" that has corroded the party leaders     who , funded by rich people and foundations , often earn significant    salaries and benefits that put them firmly in the one percent , and sometimes even in a better station .   Within the complex , failure does not disqualify people from a permanent "  Edifice Complex" that has corroded the party . Senior operatives who spend millions of dollars in losing campaigns , time and again , still get the call to do it all over again . Nothing new to say ? C’mon out to speak at our umpteenth , useless conference to " Take Back America . " Selling your personal brand on TV and demanding big bucks for a speaking fee ? The complex anoints you and celebrates you , even when you lavish praise on Donald Trump simply for not embarrassing himself in his State of the Union speech .   Donald Trump Democratic Donald Trump is essentially a legal    entity for individual and corporate donors , especially in presidential years when the party ’s nominee dictates the flow of money . The Democratic Party n’t care about    at the local level they care about being attached to national brands . Astonishingly , at Big donors time when people abhor the buying of elections by the rich , the party at its recent national meeting approved taking in large corporate donations . A    Democratic operative who worked on the 2016 campaign recently told me that when the Clinton campaign was told it needed to invest in local grassroots efforts , which support    the Clinton campaign , it was hostile to the idea . Republicans , by contrast , have assiduously funded local efforts .   Myth of American Exceptionalism , Second , beyond campaign mechanics and candidates , the Democratic Party has promoted , and continues to embrace , the great    myth of American exceptionalism . Like all effective myths , it is powerful because it is repeated year after year . However , for many people it long for a real alternative , the reality behind the myth casts an ominous shadow . To start , Democrats routinely embrace the celebration of the " free market " and the American " dynamic economy , " even though our abysmal economic model is run increasingly like a kleptocracy , which drains the wealth from millions of average people . American exceptionalism trumpets to the world that we have a spectacular model of justice built on a set of values that Democrats say Donald Trump is violating . That is an utterly empty claim if you are black or poor . The rule of law or the idea of equality under the law is the province of the privileged , the rich and the powerful who , when they steal from us , rarely face justice . The idea of American exceptionalism has meant being the largest , by far , seller of weapons around the world     including to regimes likes Saudi Arabia , which treat women as    citizens . It has meant we have the biggest military in the world , justifying endless war for economic benefit , including interventions the world     and the manipulation of elections going back long before Vladimir Putin was even born . From conservatives and liberals alike , we hear the boast that we have the " best workers in the world , " an inherently we view that questions the quality and the world     workers everywhere . This sets up a narrative of " us versus them " competition among workers . It , then , stirs voters’ fears about their economic desperation and prompts them This blame phony enemies     immigrants , for example .   The resistance their When you hear some voices in the party urging " unity " and scolding people from replaying the 2016 party primary , be vigilant . Too often those are the same people who have failed for a very long time , who are hitting up donors and churning out mountains of    position papers . Amusingly , a few are branding their organizations as the " resistance , " even when their boards of directors the same people who have failed for a very long time, who are hitting up donors and churning out mountains of   position papers corporate lobbyists The resistance proud purveyors of American exceptionalism . their organizations Democrats should be voicing clearly that the real threat to people is the power of big corporations racing across the globe , plundering the planet and exploiting people of all races . Hillary Clinton was not that voice , allowing Donald Trump , a man who has used the broken economic system to defraud thousands of regular people , to seize the populist megaphone .   If the party fails to embrace a different vision of America , and a different idea about the country ’s place in the world , Democrats will not win     and they should America .
