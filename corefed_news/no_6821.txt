U. S. President Donald Trump is pushing Britain behind the European Union in the queue to strike new trade deal , unnamed sources have told The Times . [ The sources , who are described as being " close to both sides " say that German Chancellor Angela Merkel last month convinced U. S. President Donald Trump that talks on a trade deal between the EU and U. S. would be simpler than he German Chancellor Angela Merkel .   This in turn led to a " realisation " in the White House that an EU EU deal would be more important than a deal with Britain . The claims come after House Speaker Paul Ryan hinted earlier this week that the an EU trade deal be resurrected . On a visit to Britain , he told Britain Policy Paul Ryan   : " Now that Article 50 has been invoked , the UK and EU will determine the best path forward   …      " We want the parties the UK and EU come together and strike a lasting agreement . A strong    relationship is in all of our best interests . " In that same vein , the U. S. will continue to work closely with our EU friends and our EU path forward on TTIP negotiations . " Most commentators believed the deal after Mr Trump ’s election as President , especially as one of his first acts was Mr Trump’s election as President pull out of the similar    Partnership ( TPP ) between the U. S. and the U. S. In November , the EU effectively admitted defeat over the deal with Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström saying it would make no sense to expect further talks on the issue . Negotiations had already stalled due to European demands over American product standards and a demand for access to U. S. public sector contracts . In January , Professor Ted Malloch , who is widely tipped to be President Trump ’s pick for ambassador to the EU , also said : " TTIP is a    it is n’t going to happen TTIP the Trump world . "
