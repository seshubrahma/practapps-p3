On this weekend ’s broadcast of " Fox News Sunday , " Democratic    nominee Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s Friday comments that if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ’s bodyguards had Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s bodyguards guns taken away we would " see what happens to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s , " was an incitement to violence .   When asked if   Friday comments that if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s bodyguards had their guns taken away we would "see what happens to her are an incitement to violence against Hillary Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s Kaine said , " I do . I mean , use the other example , you put it in the other example context of other things , He has Kaine if Hillary gets elected we may need Second Amendment people to take care of this . What did that mean when he said Kaine just three weeks ago ? And when you look at a series of these comments that he is Kaine I do believe it is an incitement or at a minimum an expression to indifference as to whether violence would occur . This is a pattern that has been repeated over and over again and I think it does This belong in any race , much less a race to be president of this country .
