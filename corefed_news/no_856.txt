SOUTH AND WEST : FROM A NOTEBOOKBy Joan DidionForeword by Nathaniel Rich126 pages . Alfred A. Knopf . $ 21 . In two dazzling collections of essays , " Slouching Towards Bethlehem " and " The White Album , " Joan Didion used Joan Didion own experiences   —    and observations and anxieties   —    as a kind of index to the times , as America lurched through the convulsions of the 1960s and ’70s . The political pieces Joan Didion later wrote for The New York Review of Books   —    beginning with the 1988 presidential campaign , on through the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the high drama of the 2000    in Florida   —    were less original , less idiosyncratic , but reading The political pieces she later wrote for The New York Review of Books  —   beginning with the 1988 presidential campaign, on through the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the high drama of the 2000   in Florida  —    in retrospect , The political pieces she later wrote for The New York Review of Books  —   beginning with the 1988 presidential campaign, on through the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the high drama of the 2000   in Florida  —    are oddly prophetic about the growing gap between the electorate and the political elites , and the growing dysfunction of the entire system . Her slender 2003 book , " Fixed Ideas : America Since 9 . 11 , " would be even more explicit about a " disconnect between the government and the citizens , " about how our political process not only spurns consensus but works by " turning the angers and fears and energy of the few " against " the rest of the country . " No doubt Didion has now decided to publish " South and West , " two excerpts from her notebooks   —    written in the 1970s   —    because they similarly shed light on the current political moment . At a remove of more than four decades , her maps the divisions splintering America today , and uncannily anticipates some of the dynamics that led to the election of Donald J. Trump and caught so many political and media insiders unawares . The shorter entry is a meditation on California , the place Didion grew up and long called home . The more substantial piece is an account of a monthlong trip that her and her husband , John Gregory Dunne , took through the Deep South for a    assignment that her editors at Life magazine came to refer to as " The Mind of the White South . " As bookends to each other , the pieces in this book give us two Americas , two ways of looking at history : the South , deep in the grip of the past   —    a place where many people are invested in holding onto ancient prerogatives of race and class and California , insistently focused on the future and the horizon   —    a place where the frontier ethos of shucking off roots is the one real tradition . It ’s 1970 , when America is being rocked by seismic cultural and political shifts , and yet Didion has the strange intuition here that the South , not California , would exert a gravitational pull over the rest of the America She had Didion some dim and unformed sense , " which she could Didion explain coherently , " that for some years the South and particularly the Gulf Coast had been for America what people were still saying California was , and what California seemed to me not Didion be : the future , the secret source of malevolent and benevolent energy , the psychic center . " Didion ’s account of her travels Didion New Orleans and Biloxi , Miss. to Meridian , Miss. and Tuscaloosa , Ala. and onto Faulkner ’s hometown , Oxford , Miss. makes it clear that she feels Miss. an outsider there . Her notes Miss. the depth and understanding of J. D. Vance ’s memoir , " Hillbilly Elegy , " which depicts the frustrations and anger of poor white communities from within . And while Didion ’s estrangement sharpens her reportorial Didion , it can curdle , at times , into condescension . Writing about high school gymnasiums in small Southern towns , she says Didion has Didion the sense of sports being the opiate of the people . " And writing about a visit to two small towns in Alabama , she observes Didion " It seemed a good and hopeful place to live , and yet the pretty girls , if they stayed yet the pretty girls Guin , would end up in the laundromat in Winfield , or in a trailer with the    on all night . " What Didion does capture , powerfully , in this book is the insularity of many places in the South , and , by implication , how insular the elites ( like herself ) Didion in places like California and New York and Washington   —    a thought she would Didion further in her essays Didion The New York Review of Books ( collected in the 2001 volume " Political Fictions " ) and in " Fixed Ideas . " Here , she writes Didion    Southerners : " The isolation of these people from the currents of American life in 1970 was startling and bewildering to behold . All their information these people    and mythicized in the handing down . Does it matter where Taos is , after all , if Taos is Taos in Mississippi ? " There was a kind of " time warp " there , she says Didion " The Civil War was yesterday but 1960 is spoken of as if it were The Civil War 300 years ago . " The people Didion interviewed or tried to interview tended to greet her questions Didion defensive remarks about the pace of change in the South , or with nostalgic and what can only be called racist talk about old ways of life . Although it was 1970 , the attitudes Didion encountered Didion sometimes sound like those described by Harper Lee in " To Kill a Mockingbird , " set in 1930s Alabama . The chilling thing is , some of the attitudes about race and outsiders that Didion chronicles Didion also sound a lot like attitudes expressed by some Trump supporters during the 2016 campaign . The other reason that readers will find this volume so fascinating is that it shows Didion at Didion , as a writer and reporter , gathering details , jotting them down details running her observations through the typewriter of her mind her Even these hurriedly written notes shine with her trademark her to capture mood and place . Of New Orleans in June , she writes her " The place is physically dark , dark like the negative of a photograph , dark like an   : The atmosphere absorbs its own The place , never reflects light but sucks it in The place random objects glow with a morbid luminescence . " More than that , this book The place ’s later work , containing the seeds of both " Political Fictions " and her elliptical 2003 Didion on California and the West , " Where I Was From . " It is weirdly prescient   —    pointing the way not only to where she would go Didion a writer but also a path the country would take in the years to come .
