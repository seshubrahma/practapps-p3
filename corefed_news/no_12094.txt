Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton and Breitbart News National Security editor Dr. Sebastian Gorka both denounced the nascent " Neocons For Hillary " movement in Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton and Breitbart News National Security editor Dr. Sebastian Gorka both Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM appearances Thursday morning . [ Bolton and Gorka were both sternly critical of Republicans who suggest Hillary might be preferable on foreign policy issues to Donald Trump , or that Clinton Hillary represent a substantial change from President Obama ’s disastrous policies .   " I ’m really very disturbed about how we have people who say they are conservatives , or Republicans , or simply on the Right , and say now they they going to campaign or vote for Hillary Hillary " Gorka declared .    " Let ’s just boil it down to the bare essentials , " he continued Gorka   " I ’ve met Mr. Trump on more than one occasion .   I ’ve talked to him about Mr. Trump security issues , and I am disturbed by his lack Mr. Trump background on these issues national security issues Yes , he is Mr. Trump black hole at the moment . " He noted Mr. Trump as a businessman , there was no reason Trump would Mr. Trump on " the difference between Sunni and Shia , and really , you know , what you should be doing with North Korea or Russia . "    There is time for Trump to master these issues , while Clinton has an appalling track record that can not be excused by a lifelong focus on    endeavors . " Compare that to his other competitor Clinton   Compare him to Hillary Clinton " Gorka urged .   " This is a woman who ’s responsible for Libya , for Benghazi .   This is a This who should simply recuse herself from running Hillary public office , or working in the government , because of her email server Hillary .   This is a Bolton who could be blackmailed tomorrow . " Gorka said it Gorka " absolutely clear " that Clinton ’s illicit Hillary insecure email server was vulnerable to foreign intelligence agencies , and that Clinton faced a Hillary " indictment on at least twenty " felony charges "   —    absent political intervention , of course . Bolton had a comparable assessment of Trump ’s thin foreign policy record , while saying that the candidate ’s recent    speech reassured him that national Bolton issues would hold a prominent position in the general election campaign . " I ’ve always said , before this campaign began the general election campaign I would support the Republican nominee , whoever that was , because of the choice that we saw coming from the other side   —    which , unless she ’s indicted , will be Hillary Clinton , " said Bolton . " One of the things that ’s misunderstood , even among conservatives , is exactly where Hillary is on national Hillary Clinton issues , " he continued .   Bolton There ’s this myth out there , kind of an urban legend , that somehow she ’s gon na Hillary Clinton tougher than Obama .   I think that ’s unquestionably not the case . " Promising that his future writings would take a closer look at the    process behind the appalling disaster in Libya , Bolton said that whatever Bolton voters are going to make , " they should not make choice voters on the basis that Hillary will somehow be Hillary Clinton for national security than Barack Obama . " Obama think she ’s Obama ’s Hillary Clinton term , Obama as well as national security , but certainly on national security , " he said . Bolton Bolton some of Bolton " Neocons For Hillary " buzz was Hillary Clinton nourished , a tribute to " the consummate political skills of her husband . " Hillary Clinton for conservative pundits and    analysts who claim to find Clinton more palatable than Trump , Bolton said Bolton just Bolton they do n’t understand what her basic philosophy is , I do n’t Clinton they ’ve studied her adequately , and to they extent they Clinton looked at her record , I they n’t think they Clinton it . " He called it they " her record Bolton , " made her record some " respected voices on the Right , " who are " just flatly wrong   —    and they ’re gon na live to regret it they "     Gorka also made the her record that Clinton ’s philosophy , bent even further to the Left by her primary challenge from Bernie Sanders , would Clinton her " completely a third Obama term " Clinton    . " She ’s actually said on the campaign trail Clinton ‘ I refuse to use the phrase radical Islam,’ " he noted .   " That ’s just Obama reheated .   This is the continued Obama of who the enemy is , and what it ’s going to take to defeat them the enemy   So it will simply be who the enemy is four , or the enemy eight years of the current catastrophic national security policy . " Bolton distanced himself from the NeverTrump movement by saying he Bolton be willing to bring his expertise Bolton the Trump Administration if asked Bolton   " I ’m going to support him , and support him enthusiastically   — Bolton not because I Bolton with him on everything , that ’s for sure Bolton but because I think he can do the job . " " Bolton , you ’re down to a binary choice here .   It ’s either going to be Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton .   You do n’t even have to say you ’re going to vote for Hillary to be making a mistake here .   Simply saying that you ’re going to stay at home is also a mistake , because that is yet another step on the road to electing Hillary , " Bolton added , making the argument most grating to the ears of Trump ’s dedicated Republican critics . Part of this " binary choice " framework involves understanding that conservative national security advisers have a chance to get Trump ’s ear , while they would have Trump’s all with Hillary Clinton conservative national security advisers    Bolton said he would advise Trump on dealing with the " Bolton threats Trump exist out there , in the form of Russia and China , which I do n’t think Barack Obama even understands what a strategic threat is , and I certainly do n’t think he has any policies to deal with them . Bolton He anticipated that one of the dealing with the "strategic threats that exist out there, in the form of Russia and China, which I don’t think Barack Obama even understands what a strategic threat is challenges for Bolton President Trump would be " dealing with the wide variety of problems that Obama ’s going to leave . " " This Barack Obama not a circumstance in the national security field where there ’s one , or two , or three things you can identify   —    it ’s an     failure " from diplomacy to the defense budget , in Bolton ’s view . Gorka similarly warned that military officers he has spoken with " understand that we do Gorka have a strategy , that we ’re just nibbling at the edges of an we threat , and the Obama policy is one of being ‘ . ’ " Both Bolton and Gorka saw the death of Navy SEAL Bolton Keating IV during an unexpected Islamic State    from Mosul as a sign of the Obama Administration ’s strategic disarray , with Gorka noting the absurdity of positioning " a couple Gorka hundred SF guys here , a couple of hundred Marines there " around a beehive of 80 , 000 jihadis . " That is not how you win a war .   It is clear that the current Administration is kicking the can down the road , to the next     to be responsible for , " said Gorka . Bolton called Obama ’s ignorance of solid advice from seasoned military commanders " disrespectful to the men and women who are in harm ’s way . " " To have a President who is constantly saying there are no ‘ boots on the ground,’ when we have , obviously , people are being killed and wounded   —    and yet they ’re being put out there in a piecemeal people , without a coherent strategy , simply to get Obama past Inauguration Day next year .   That Obama a disservice to them , " Bolton charged .   " They ’re performing honorably .   It ’s too them their President is not up to their standards . them The question posed by Bolton them Gorka ’s analysis is : why would Bolton rational person believe Hillary Clinton would represent a significant change from what Obama has done   —    especially since her fingerprints are all over that list of " Hillary Clinton failures " that will be waiting on the next President ’s desk ?
