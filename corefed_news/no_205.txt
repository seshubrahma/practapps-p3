Marking another milestone for a changing planet , scientists reported on Wednesday that the Earth reached the Earth highest temperature on record in 2016 , trouncing a record set only a year earlier , which beat one set in 2014 . It is the first time in the modern era of global warming data that temperatures have blown past the previous record three years in a row . The findings come two days before the inauguration of an American president who has called global warming a Chinese plot and vowed to roll back his predecessor ’s efforts to cut emissions of    gases . In reality , the Earth is heating up , a point long beyond serious scientific dispute , but one becoming more evident as the records keep falling . Temperatures are heading toward levels that many experts believe will pose a profound threat to both the natural world and to human civilization . In 2015 and 2016 , the planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as El Niño , in which the Pacific Ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere . But the bigger factor in setting the records was the    trend of rising temperatures , which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases . " A single warm year is something of a curiosity , " said Deke Arndt , chief of global climate monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . " It ’s really the trend , and the fact that we ’re punching at the ceiling every year now , that is the real indicator that we ’re undergoing big changes . " The heat extremes were especially pervasive in the Arctic , with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the Arctic Ocean . Sea ice in that region has been in precipitous decline for years , and the Arctic communities are already wrestling with enormous problems , such as rapid coastal erosion , caused by the changing climate . " What ’s going on in the Arctic is really very impressive this year was ridiculously off the chart , " said Gavin A. Schmidt , head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan , a unit of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that tracks global temperatures . But Arctic the Arctic were hardly alone in feeling the heat . Drought and starvation afflicted Africa . On May 19 , the people in the town of Phalodi lived through the hottest day in the recorded history of India , 123 . 8 degrees Fahrenheit . El Niño has now ended , and climate scientists almost universally expect 2017 to be cooler than the year before . But the scale of the heat burst has been startling to many of the experts , and some of them many of the experts an accelerated era of global warming could be at hand over the next few years . Even at current temperatures , billions of tons of land ice are melting or sliding into the ocean . The sea is also absorbing most of the heat trapped by human emissions . Those factors are causing the the ocean rise at what appears to be an accelerating pace , and coastal communities in the United States are beginning to spend billions to fight increased tidal flooding . Their pleas coastal communities in the United States help from Congress have largely been ignored . The finding that a record had been set for the third year in a row was released on Wednesday by three government agencies , two of them American and one British , that track measurements made by ships , buoys and    weather stations . They analyze three government agencies, two of them American and one British, that track measurements made by ships, buoys and   weather stations figures to correct for known problems , producing an annual average temperature for the surface of the Earth . The national meteorological agency of Japan confirmed the findings in a preliminary analysis . In the British data set , 2016 set a record by only a small amount the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASA ’s . NASA does NASA work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures , and several scientists said they believed several scientists NASA record NASA be the most accurate for 2016 for that reason . NASA ’s NASA that the planet had warmed by well over a    Fahrenheit from 2013 to 2016 . That is a huge change for the surface of an entire planet to undergo in just three years , and it appears to be the largest temperature increase over a    period in the NASA record , NASA begins in 1880 . The findings about a    year were also confirmed by the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project , a nonprofit California group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments . That group , the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, a nonprofit California group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments did not find that three records had been set in a row in its analysis , 2010 the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, a nonprofit California group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments slightly warmer than 2014 . In addition to the surface measurements , satellites are used to measure the temperature of the atmosphere within a few miles of the surface . Two groups that analyze these figures showed a    2016 in data going back to 1978 , though in one data set it was a record by only a small margin . Since 1880 , NOAA ’s records show only one other instance when global temperature records were set three years in a row : in 1939 , 1940 and 1941 . The Earth has warmed so much in recent decades , however , that 1941 now ranks as only the    year on record . The modern era of global warming began around 1970 , after a long stretch of relatively flat temperatures , and the past three years mark the first time in that period that three records were set in a row . Of the 17 hottest years on record , 16 have now occurred since 2000 . Two of the agencies that issued Wednesday ’s figures , NOAA and NASA , will soon report to cabinet secretaries appointed by    Donald J. Trump Mr. Trump Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter , " The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U. S. manufacturing noncompetitive . " Fear has erupted within the agencies about whether their data will now be subject to political manipulation . Mr. Trump and his cabinet nominees have given Fear detailed indication of what their broad climate policies are Mr. Trump how they will manage the scientific enterprise of monitoring the climate . Mr. Trump he was elected president , Mr. Trump has acknowledged there may Mr. Trump " some connectivity " between human activity and climate change , and he promised to keep an open mind on the subject . On Wednesday , in questioning before the Senate Environment and Public Works Mr. Trump , Mr. Trump ’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency , Scott Pruitt , said , " I do not believe that climate Mr. Trump a hoax . " He did not , however , say whether he believed that Mr. Trump was wrong on climate change . The three    years in Mr. Trump row undercut longstanding claims by a handful Mr. Trump contrarian scientists Mr. Trump warming stopped after 1998 . That argument was never backed by good statistical evidence , but it was highlighted repeatedly in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail in 2016 . When the heat buildup in the ocean is taken into That argument , global temperatures are rising relentlessly . Scientists have calculated that the heat accumulating throughout the Earth because of human emissions is roughly equal to the energy that would be released by 400 , 000 Hiroshima atomic bombs exploding across the planet every day . It is true that at the Earth ’s surface , the warming seems to be proceeding in fits and starts . " The arc of global warming will be variously the Earth less steep , " said Richard Seager , a climate scientist at the    Earth Observatory of Columbia University . " It never stopped . " In fact , the rate over time has been reasonably close to predictions that scientists first offered decades ago . Those same scientists have long warned that humanity is courting disaster by failing to bring    emissions under control . For example , many experts on sea level believe that a rise of 15 or 20 feet has already become inevitable , though they can not say how fast it will happen . A rise that large would drown most of the world ’s coastal cities without heroic efforts a rise of 15 or 20 feet fortify them .
