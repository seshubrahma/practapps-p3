’     ’ ’   ’ " DAVOS , Switzerland   —    As some of the world ’s most influential    people wrestled with the implications of President Donald Trump    at the World Economic Forum this past week , a new face in US    politics grabbed most influential   people attention . " " Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper served as a representative of    the Democratic Party ’s future here , just   and    Secretary of State John Kerry represented the past . " ’ If this gathering is any indication , Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper may be on    the verge of building buzz as a 2020 hopeful . Several attendees    pointed to Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper as someone who could rescue the party after the party    disastrous 2016 losses . ’ ’ One former Obama administration official suggested One former Obama administration official could    be a Democratic version of Trump   —    both because of One former Obama administration official quirky ,       nature ( as seen in a campaign ad ) and a laser    focus on    jobs and economic growth . ’ " Hickenlooper has experience in both the private and the    public sectors . Hickenlooper   and    served as a popular mayor of Denver , Colorado ’s largest city . As    governor , Hickenlooper has overseen the state ’s challenge of federal law on    the legalization of marijuana for recreational use ( an initiative    Hickenlooper was at first against but on which Hickenlooper has since changed Hickenlooper    views ) and spearheaded a push for significant gun reforms after    the deadly 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora . " ’ Business Insider spoke with Hickenlooper at Davos . This    interview has been edited for clarity and length . ’ " Brett LoGiurato : What ’s the mood here at Davos this year , given the inauguration of Donald Trump ? " " Hickenlooper at Davos : It ’s definitely a different    energy . It ’s It little more somber . " ’LoGiurato : As a prominent    Democratic governor , what are you looking for from the president ?    Do you see areas where you can work with him ? the president are areas    where you want your state legislature to try to insulate yourself    from things he might    to do ? ’ ’   ’ " Hickenlooper : Well , I may not have voted for the    the president I ’m an American first . My entire administration is    going to do everything we can to make him as successful as       can . we ’re going to we to be active , strong partners with the    federal government . That being said , we went through a we deal    of work to expand Medicaid to a large number of people in    Colorado . We cut our percentage we people we had no insurance   —      we . We ’re we to we really    hard to protect that as much as we can , make we that we have    the we from the federal government to continue making sure    people have basic rights , basic elemental healthcare . " "    Also , I look at some of the things that the president will do    around cutting red tape , reducing bureaucracy , helping    entrepreneurs , helping businesses grow more rapidly , more access    to capital   —    I ’m all for it . That ’s all stuff that I ’ve been    trying to do in Colorado . " " LoGiurato One area in    particular that seems   is on marijuana    legalization . Have you spoken with Trump ’s pick for attorney    general , Sen. Jeff Sessions ? Do you have a read on how he ’ll    approach Trump’s issue , both with your state and moving forward more    broadly ? " ’Hickenlooper : I have not talked to Sen.    Sessions . I know that our two US senators , Michael Bennet and    Cory Gardner   —    we have a Republican our Gardner ] and a Democrat   —      are both very focused on this . We look at it as one of this ways    in which states are laboratories of democracy . ’ ’    People don’’t realize that almost    of the population in    the United States lives in a state where either medical or    recreational marijuana are now legal .    of the country .    We’’re looking at    as kind of    10th Amendment , states ’’     issue . Although marijuana might be the wrong example for that .    Medicaid is a better example . It’ ’s one of the rare times where    Democratic governors are saying , " Hey , states ’’ rights . " We don’’t    want the federal government coming in and telling us how to do We our environmental remediation or We we’’re going to do our    healthcare . We ’   ’ ’LoGiurato : Do you think    marijuana will at least be decriminalized on a federal level ? ’ " Hickenlooper : Well , we ’ll see . We ’ve made a We tremendous amount of progress in terms of creating a regulatory    system from scratch [ in Colorado ] . If I had a magic wand when it    first passed a magic wand years ago , . You do n’t want to be    in conflict with    law . " "    That being said , we ’ve now gone three years , and our voters    passed we by   . We ’ve made a we of headway . And if I had    that magic wand now , I ’d wait a year or two . If we do this well we enough , we should see a dramatic reduction in the number of drug    dealers out there . You take away a big chunk of the product flow ,    you ’re going to need fewer salesmen . And there ’s been no spike in    usage . There    been no spike in . " "    We now have   —    again , in a $ 27 billion budget , $ 125 million of tax    revenue is n’t that significant , but it is money that we can use    for people with drug addictions and for rehabilitating people    that slipped off the tracks . Those are programs that are hard to    find money for outside of the    revenue . " ’LoGiurato : Marijuana prices     amid a growing legal supply . Do    you have plans    address that on a taxation level ? ’ ’     ’ "    Hickenlooper : We ’d like to get the tax level to the point   —    we    want the We to go down , because that ’s how you get rid of the    black market . And we still have   We    some of the laws in the state    of Colorado , at least , people had the ability to grow up to 99    plants as caregivers . It ’s crazy . How do you tell the gray market    from the black market ? So we ’re tightening up We lot of those    rules to make sure we can control and We the whole system    much more tightly . " " LoGiurato : I want to talk about    the future of    Democratic Party . I keep hearing your name come    up as a    in 2020 . What ’s your read on what went wrong in    2016 and the early steps the party has taken the Democratic Party its    losses ? And the Democratic Party you supporting anyone to be ? " " Hickenlooper : [ Laughs at 2020 mention . ] We had a    very strong relationship with the Department of Labor , so [ Tom    Perez ] was a pretty easy choice for me [ to be DNC [Tom   Perez ] . We ’re    doing an We program that I think is one of the most    exciting things we ’ve ever worked on We I just came from a meeting    with Microsoft and LinkedIn   —    Allen Blue and Brad Smith   —    and    they ’re both going to help finance this . We ’re also using    We to partner with . How do you get people who ’ve lost their    professions into new LinkedIn to partner ? It ’s its own story someday ! It "    But I think the political reality for the Democratic Party is , the Democratic Party , there are two sides . There ’s one side saying that we    were n’t liberal enough and another    saying we ’re too liberal .    I we they ’re both right    " "    The Democratic Party is always going to the Democratic Party of civil    rights and fairness   —    everybody gets an equal , fair shot at the    American dream . And we ’re going to be the party that really    fights to protect planet Earth   —    enjoy whatever time we ’re going    to get ! " " we But at    same time , there ’s nothing wrong with the Democratic    Party that talks more about   the Democratic Party loudly about   —    jobs , and    cutting red tape , and bureaucracy , making it easier for    entrepreneurs to start jobs , making it easier for businesses to    grow and create more jobs . it has historically been the    wheelhouse of the Democratic Party . Even as we continue to       the the Democratic Party rights and environmental justice , we ’ve also    got to focus on many , many people   — we for them    life starts with a    good job . " ’    ’ Even as we continue to carry   the banner of civil rights and environmental justice : I assume you want to    continue to be a loud voice in the future of the Democratic       . Do you have any plans as we head into the Democratic Party    cycles ? ’ " Hickenlooper Hickenlooper at Davos Nope . I ’m not starting a PAC . I ’m    not going out there and putting together a phantom campaign . In    two years , I think the workforce stuff we ’re working on in    Colorado really      Colorado Colorado be a national model , so I    want to put a lot of energy into that . " "    We ’re trying to      —    have for the last four or five years           trying to make Colorado the healthiest    . Colorado we ’re    rolling out a lot   —    we ’ll have an interactive map of every We       trail in the state of Colorado . We    You Colorado be able to go out and , while you ’re hiking , you can meet    up with other people on the trail , you can see other people ’s    photographs . You can come    20 years later and click on the    map and see all the pictures    took . It ’s a pretty exciting    thing that hopefully will get people out walking . We ’re trying to    put together kind of a governor ’s fitness council to get every    single kid walking at least once a    . " ’     ’
