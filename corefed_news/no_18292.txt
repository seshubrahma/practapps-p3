’   ’ ’    President Donald Trump told Bloomberg News on Monday    that the healthcare bill President Donald Trump wants Congress to pass is " not    in the healthcare bill he wants Congress to pass final form right now . ’ ’It will be every bit as good on      conditions as Obamacare , " President Donald Trump said . ’ "    But currently , the bill    —    because of changes Trump ’s own White House    sought to the healthcare bill he wants Congress to pass is "not   in its final form right now . To secure the votes of members of the      House Freedom Caucus , the White House an    amendment that would allow states to waive Obamacare rules that    protect people with preexisting conditions . " ’    Republican trepidation about undermining these protections is a    major reason there are not the votes to pass the the healthcare bill he wants Congress to pass is "not   in its final form right now the    House . For example , Rep. Billy Long of Missouri   —    not a moderate    by any measure   —     he can’’t vote for the latest    version of the American Health Care Act because it " strips away the latest   version of the American Health Care Act any guarantee that preexisting conditions would be covered and    affordable . " ’ ’    But some Republicans are claiming that the Republican bill is    good enough on preexisting conditions , already    meeting Trump’ ’s promise to be " every bit as good " as    Obamacare on this measure . ’ ’’ ’    " The Republican plan protects people with      conditions , " a spokesperson for Speaker Paul Ryan told NBC News .    " States can’’t opt out without a high risk pool to take care of    them . And waivers States can’’t apply to anyone who has been continuously    covered . We believe there is more than one way to address this    problem . " ’ "    This argument is similar to . The idea    is , while the Republican bill would allow insurers to charge    sick people more for insurance , it would still protect the Republican bill    because insurers would n’t be able to raise prices on you due    to your health as long as you never let    your coverage lapse . And if you did let your coverage lapse ,    you ’d be able to go buy a plan through a    pool . " ’    This argument is highly misleading , for two reasons . ’ "    The first is that coverage gaps are common . Often , people lose    health insurance coverage because they lose a job health insurance coverage Many people    can not afford to buy their own health insurance Many people    they ’ve lost    Many people    income from their job .   Many people    ’    Ponnuru argues that the insurance subsidies in the AHCA would    help people avoid coverage gaps . In some cases , they would . But people the subsidies (    $ 2 , 000 to $ 4 , 000 per person ) would not be    sufficient to buy    comprehensive insurance policy . Many people    would still find    unaffordable to maintain coverage when they    face a Many people         —    especially if they    older or Many people    live in    markets . ’       A possible exception would be if the abolition of     allows insurers to design limited insurance policies that are    scoped to be priced equal to the credit amounts   —    for    example , you might be able to get a health plan for $ 2 , 000 , just    using your tax credit and making no payment out of pocket , but    the plan would    cover doctor ’s visits or hospitalization . " "    In this scenario    people would find it easy to maintain some form    of continuous coverage , but health insurance markets would become     as I wrote in    March . ( Also , people would have health insurance that does n’t    cover important benefits , such as doctor ’s visits . ) " "    If everything else fails , Ponnuru and Ryan ’s spokesperson both    argue that uninsured sick people could fall back on a      pool . And indeed , under the Republican healthcare law , states    waiving the preexisting condition protections would have to    provide some form    subsidized    or reinsurance program    to help insurers       patients . "       But the law would impose the Republican healthcare law test on these programs . ’ ’    Before Obamacare , many states offered    pools ,    which    intended to    subsidized insurance to      patients who insurers would otherwise be unwilling to    cover at an affordable    . The problem was , covering these    patients is very expensive    and public funding to subsidize the    pools routinely proved to be insufficient to cover the    number of people who needed such coverage . ’ ’    As a result , pools often featured very high pricing    ( unaffordable to many    participants ) and waiting lists to    participate . The Republican plan would likely lead to the    return of this dysfunction . ’ ’    Protecting people with preexisting conditions , to ensure they can    buy affordable people ,    one of the most popular parts of    Obamacare . The current Republican proposal does The Republican plan protections , despite what its supporters claim . ’ ’President Donald Trump The Republican plan Bloomberg News on . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
