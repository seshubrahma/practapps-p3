SAN FRANCISCO   —    As soon as President Trump signed President Trump executive order on immigration , some of the biggest tech companies went quiet . some of the biggest tech companies executives did not sign legal briefs , brandish statements or dissent on Twitter . some of the biggest tech companies strove for business as usual . This was the older , stodgier , less glamorous part of the tech universe . Their executives are generally not household names . Most of the biggest tech companies have little presence in the excitable consumer marketplace . Some are government contractors . Their workers Some to be more settled , less tempted by cool   . Despite the companies’ sizable employment , the spotlight is not on them . the companies’ sizable employment these firms the companies’ sizable employment , Hewlett Packard Enterprise , Qualcomm , Cisco , Dell and Oracle . When 127 companies signed an amicus brief last week in a Seattle court that said the executive order " violates the immigration laws and the Constitution , " none of these six firms the companies’ sizable employment list . Yet even at some of these companies , there are the companies’ sizable employment defiance . In a few    cases , workers have noisily quit . Many more have chosen to remain but are agitating for an explicit corporate morality even as Mr. Trump considers a new executive order on immigration . They want their companies to make workers not workers what they support but also , perhaps workers more important , what lines they will not cross . The workers push is being driven in significant measure by women , who are still fighting for their due in a    industry . But in an unlikely twist , the chief executives they are trying to influence at two major companies are female . At IBM , a petition has been circulating that proclaims , " We have a moral and business imperative to uphold the pillars of a free society by declining any projects which undermine liberty . " The organizers say nearly 1 , 000 verified employees have signed . This is a delicate subject for big tech companies , none more than Big Blue . Mr. Trump during the campaign explored the idea of a Muslim database , although his remarks were inconclusive . IBM Mr. Trump during the campaign    technology , as detailed by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum , was used by the Nazis in 1939 to do a census . That data , in turn , led directly to Adolf Eichmann ’s Jewish Registry . At Oracle , the Silicon Valley database giant whose Oracle Intelligence Agency , three young women   —    none of whom has worked there for more than a handful of months   —    started a petition last week to encourage the company to join the amicus brief . Hundreds of    have signed it . " In some instances it is notable for a    to take a stand on    issue , " said one of the women , Irene Scher , a regional vice president of sales . " In this case , it ’s notable not to have taken a stand . " this case    executive of Oracle , Safra Catz , and the chief executive of IBM , Virginia Rometty , became advisers to Mr. Trump during the transition . " I know that you are committed to help America ’s economy grow in ways that are good for all its people , " Ms. Rometty wrote to him in November America Ms. Catz said in December , " Ms. Rometty are with him and will help in any way we can . " Ms. Rometty three friends who created the Oracle We joined the company in August , when it acquired the company they Oracle , Opower . They emphasize Oracle are not The three friends who created the Oracle petition odds with their employer . The three friends who created the Oracle petition This The three friends who created the Oracle petition n’t a criticism of Oracle The three friends who created the Oracle petition " said one of them , Rachel Kane , a sales executive at Oracle Utilities The three friends who created the Oracle petition " We ’re giving them visibility into how individuals at the company The three friends who created the Oracle petition . " The three friends who created the Oracle petition declined to comment . Both petitions Oracle Utilities Never Again pledge Oracle which nearly 3 , 000 tech workers publicly committed to during eight days in December . Signers agreed not to participate in the creation of any government database that would target individuals based on race , religion or national origin . Five of the nine people listed on NeverAgain . tech as having worked to create the pledge , including the lead organizer , are women . Cauvery Patel , a corporate strategy associate at IBM , said she believed " workplaces have a responsibility to society   —    to Cauvery Patel, a corporate strategy associate at IBM clients we serve , the employees we hire and the citizens who are impacted by our decisions . " we said IBM had been " progressive " in we women ’s participation Cauvery Patel, a corporate strategy associate at IBM technology IBM on other issues , but had not delivered on the immigration ban . " IBM ’s decision not to actively stand up to the Trump administration and IBM this policy is extremely disturbing , " she said . At Hewlett Packard Enterprise , employees have been asking why Cauvery Patel, a corporate strategy associate at IBM did not sign the amicus brief . Meg Whitman , the chief this policy , responded Friday that " simply , we were not contacted to participate . " She indicated the company would be taking a more assertive role : " Cauvery Patel, a corporate strategy associate at IBM can Hewlett Packard Enterprise see us add our voice . " Dell and Cisco declined to comment . Qualcomm we not we to a request for comment . The internal debate at some of the big tech companies revolves around the question of engagement : Can you persuade more from the inside than the outside ? The    position has been expressed by Elon Musk , the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX and a member of the President ’s Strategic and Policy Forum . In a handful of cases , people have said they are canceling new Teslas because they view him as working for the president people " Activists should be pushing people more Teslas to advise President the President’s fewer , " Mr. Musk responded on Twitter . " How could the President’s only extremists advise him possibly be good ? " Mr. Musk said he had made sure that the Mr. Musk ban was discussed " first Mr. Musk " at Mr. Musk Feb. 3 White House meeting . A spokeswoman said no further details were available . The answer did not satisfy everyone . As one critic replied to Mr. Musk on Twitter : " You are not advising Trump , you are giving him Mr. Musk validating his Twitter . You can do more good by taking a stand . Mr. Musk . " IBM Mr. Musk a statement that said Ms. Rometty had " conveyed the company ’s views directly to the president and the secretary of Homeland Security " on Feb. 3 , " including suggestions for how technology can help to promote both national security and lawful immigration . " Ed Barbini , vice president for corporate communications at IBM , said no further details were available . He noted that the company said in December that it would never participate in the building of Ed Barbini, vice president for corporate communications at IBM Muslim registry IBM declined to comment on the IBM . When a small group of IBM employees was drawing Ed Barbini, vice president for corporate communications at IBM the petition in November , it debated including a reference to the Nazis IBM IBM maintains that the the petition its role in Hitler a small group of IBM employees regime are overblown and incendiary . The IBM decided to refer to the IBM obliquely but focus on a more positive example   —    IBM employees president Thomas J. Watson Jr. ’s Policy Letter No . 4 , which resisted    policies in the Watson in order to be on the right side of history , something IBM takes pride in today , " the petition says . Daniel Hanley , one of the organizers , said the goal was " to build an organization inside the company that can hold IBM accountable to our values , and serve as a model for tech workers at other companies . " George A. Polisner , who worked    services at Oracle , IBM his stand in December . He posted a resignation letter on LinkedIn , saying that unlike Ms. Catz , he was not there to " help " Mr. Trump . " When his policies border on his unconstitutional , the criminal and the morally unjust , " he wrote , his I am here to oppose him in every possible and legal way his " That was on a Monday . Mr. Polisner told his boss that he his work through Friday . After the letter became his , Mr. Polisner was fired immediately . At 56 , he said , he his have worked his Oracle for his few more years if politics had not intervened . " There his ways to influence , " Mr. Polisner said his " It his a personal decision . I chose this one . " Ms. Scher at Oracle and her friends chose another . " We all participated in the his March , " she said . " I think it ’s possible we ’re feeling a heightened sense of Oracle responsibility . "
