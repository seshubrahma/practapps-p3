He certainly does nâ€™t speak like someone Trump would think of as a presidential candidate . It â€™s not just his Northeastern accent . He occasionally screws Trump with spelling and Trump . Trump gets mocked a lot for this Trump Especially on Twitter , and especially by people like me   â€”      members of the media elite . On Friday morning , Trump misspelled " honor " and " Trump " on Twitter . The high priests of Manhattan Twitter were almost beside themselves with delight . So let me The high priests of Manhattan media this in a way you elites can understand : As David Foster Wallace explains in a brilliant essay on English usage , there is nâ€™t just one " English . " As elite liberals are apt to understand in other contexts , what we call Standard English is really just one dialect of English   â€”    the English of rich , educated , largely white English speakers . There are many other dialects in English , associated with different regions , ethnicities , classes , and so on . Trump speaks the language of his voters   â€”    unlike other Trump candidates , and unlike people who go on TV to be professional pundits . And what does Trump tell these voters ? That the Trump are against them . That they despise them . these voters what do the elite do the elite Prove Trump right by sneering at a Trump Trump that he shares with many Trump his voters Trump Trump and his voters Trump nâ€™t speak Standard English Trump nor do they speak its cousin dialect , Politically Trump and his voters English English As Mother Jonesâ€™ Kevin Drum points out , many people dislike political correctness , not because they secretly harbor bigoted views , or many people they have a principled belief in a many people of free inquiry , but simply because Politically Correct English is a foreign dialect , which changes frequently and unpredictably . And if you do nâ€™t always master its nuances , you might suffer withering social opprobrium . ( You â€™re not exactly sure what gender to refer to Caitlyn Jenner as ? You bigot ! ) As the French thinker Pierre Bourdieu pointed out many decades ago , such systems of etiquette often function as ways for the ruling class to control the ruled , enforce class privilege , and keep the ladder to the upper class nice and slippery . And this particular form of social control only seems to be exercised against one type of person . Trump connects with Trump white working class , with the socially downtrodden , with the frustrated and despairing , and with the poorly educated and financially struggling not in spite of his    manner Trump speaking , but because of it . The wealthy , urban elite ought to remember that before they turn Trump â€™s misspellings Trump a The wealthy, urban elite party punch line .
