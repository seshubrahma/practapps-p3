Tuesday on " CBS This Morning , " Wall Street Journal columnist and former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan Peggy Noonan said the growing discontent between Republican presidential    Donald Trump and the    establishment wing could " break " the party .   President Ronald Reagan Peggy Noonan said , " You know , the Republican consultant class and the Republican Party decided nine and six and even three months ago this whole thing is going to go away and we do n’t   have to take this whole thing on , we do n’t have to attack . When the Republican consultant class and the Republican Party finally realized , ‘ Oh , my God , Trump and Trumpism are real , my God, Trump and Trumpism could win,’ the Republican consultant class and the Republican Party suddenly thought the Republican consultant class and the Republican Party had to adopt my God, Trump and Trumpism style and be tough and pugilistic . My sense is it does n’t make anybody look better . I always thought Rubio and Cruz should be going at Trump having a conversation about policy rather than insulting each other . So I ’m all for consultants beating all up but I ’m not sure if all moved earlier , it would have worked . " When asked if Trump could bring down the GOP , Noonan added , " Trump could break it . Trump could break it . Imagine what happens if Trump racks up a lot of delegates , he racks up a lot of delegates get to the convention , it looks like Trump has won , and the party machinery finagles it away from Trump . Trump supporters would blot the Republican Party . At the same time if Trump waltzes to the nomination , there is a major sliver , and maybe not just a sliver , at the top of the Republican Party that will start a Republican Party in exile . Or you can quite imagine that happening . So we ’re seeing something big . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
