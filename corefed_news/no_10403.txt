Veteran pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell , a regular on the Fox News Sunday night show " Political Insiders , " joined Breitbart ’s Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle on Monday ’s edition of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM to break down the latest Breitbart’s    national poll , which showed a significant tightening of the presidential race , placing Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump by a statistically insignificant 1 point . [ " This poll , if anything , is somewhat more Democratic , because of the samples , than This poll ought to be , " Caddell noted , suggesting the news might be even better for Donald Trump than the news appeared .   " the presidential race has tightened , " he Donald Trump . " We see that in a number of polls over the last several days , that the the presidential race tightening . There was a poll yesterday , the Morning Consult poll , where the margin had been cut from 6 to 3 in one week , in their tracking poll . "   " Clearly the    boomlet , and the Trump August problem   —    which some believe , in August , was as bad as any challenger , any candidate has had   —    seems to have now dissipated back to where we basically were 5 to 6 weeks ago , " he said any candidate " This is a tight race . The reason it ’s This tight race for the most part is that not only both candidates have problems , but that voters particularly , when they look voters what ’s been happening in the world and the country , believe that the country the country be severely on the wrong track , " Caddell explained , citing a " rather significant    decline in those who thought the country was the country the right direction . " " There clearly is a real change going on here , " he judged .     Caddell quoted from a Politico    in which Eli Stokols argued that the election had essentially been decided , and it was already too late for Donald Trump to " turn this campaign around " because his negative perception among Donald Trump voters is set in stone . Caddell cited the exceptionally long 2016    period as one reason it was premature to declare Trump ’s campaign a Donald Trump . Furthermore , he said we have a Caddell very volatile electorate " looking at " two candidates with high negatives , both of them . " " Let me just point this out : Politico being , sort of along with the Washington Post , they are ground zero for them conventional political wisdom and for the political class . And they just assume the election them over . They thought it ’s over them a the election time . The people who do n’t think it ’s over are the the election people , " Caddell said . " They ’re very nervous , the Clinton people they do n’t have control the Clinton people the dynamics . They ’re doing everything they the Clinton people to keep this the Clinton people     election , which is their best grounds . " the Clinton people " If this moves to any kind of referendum issue , which is where the country is   —    how it ’s going , what the future looks like , and really what has been the uprising this year of the American people against the political class , across the board   —    the election becomes a whole different dynamic , " he predicted . " This the political class a relatively very close election , and the way they talk , you ’d think that Clinton was ahead by 14 or 15 points . " Caddell contended this is a " new This " election , difficult to compare to previous contests , but offered the comparison of Hubert Humphrey emerging from the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago down 15 points to Richard Nixon , but Nixon was able to squeeze Richard Nixon only the most narrow of victories in the end .   " This election has not yet settled into whether it ’s an election about This election Trump , or it ’s an election about This election Clinton as the candidate of the political class   —    plus , all this stuff going on with the emails , all the other information coming out about the Foundation , reconfirm the idea that Hillary Clinton is dishonest . Hillary Clinton think she is corrupt . I think Hillary Clinton is going to be an ongoing dynamic , " Caddell predicted . He pointed to the latest Clinton Caddell story , in which the Foundation discovered billionaire Foundation donor Gilbert the Foundation was denied entry into the United States last year , due to his connections with Hezbollah in Lebanon . Caddell There ’s a lot more coming out , and of course the big deal is , they have to debate in late September his connections with Hezbollah in Lebanon which will probably have as much impact on the election as any debate we ’ve ever had , " Caddell predicted . On the question of whether Trump had a realistic chance of flipping some states traditionally thought of as Democrat turf , Caddell repeated that 2016 was an abnormal Caddell year . " Everyone assumes the map is static , the electoral map . That ’s not the case , " he contended . " We see Clinton Trump much better in Virginia , partly because of the Washington suburbs . You remember we were talking about the political class   —    that is the one place where the political class , I guess , has popularity . Meanwhile , in Nevada , Trump has been running amazingly well , and doing well with Hispanics in that state , according to some of Virginia polls out there . " " The reason is that , when this election moves , it moves across the board   …      this election that when the national polls are moving , many states are moving at the same time . The volatility that we talk about nationally is there in all of the states . It ’s not predictable . many states moves , it will move everywhere at once It " he It . " What we do n’t have yet is an established   —    and this is why I find the Politico article so laughable   —    what we do n’t have yet is a determined definition we how voters intend to vote . There ’s a lot of conflict going on , and as I said , this is also inherently a change election . That ’s what the Clinton people worry about , and it ’s the thing they should worry about , " Caddell said . the Clinton people noted that recent Breitbart News polls have also tracked the decline of public trust in major media institutions , particularly their ability to fairly cover the presidential race . recent Breitbart News polls said these polls are showing " the mainstream Caddell is recent Breitbart News polls rejected by the American people . " He noted poll respondents viewed the media as " Caddell overwhelmingly positive to Hillary Clinton , and overwhelmingly negative to Donald Trump , " a conclusion so obvious that " you would have to be deaf , dumb , and blind " not to see it . " I ’ve never seen the press on such a jihad , " Caddell marveled .   He said it was even Caddell significant that voters Caddell the mainstream media as supportive of the entrenched political class , by a nearly 2 to 1 margin . " The job of the media historically , in terms of the First Amendment   —    what I call the unspoken compact in the First Amendment   —    is that the free the First Amendment   , without checks and balances , is there in order to protect the people from power , " said Caddell . " Its job is to be a check on government , and those who rule the country , and not to be their lapdogs , and their support system . That ’s what we ’re seeing in this election their " " There is an argument to make that the major news media in this country , the mainstream media , is essentially serving against the people the country , " he charged . " They have made themselves an open ally of protecting a an argument to make that the major news media in this country, the mainstream media, is essentially serving against the people’s interest order that the the people’s people are the people’s , by three quarters or more of the American people . That makes them a legitimate issue , in a sense the American people been before , the people’s Trump takes advantage of it .
