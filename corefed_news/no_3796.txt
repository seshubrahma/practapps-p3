With a week to go before the general election in the Netherlands , the race appears to be a dead heat between the populist , nationalist Party for Freedom led by Geert Wilders and the centrist People ’s Party for Freedom led by incumbent Prime Minister Mark Rutte . [ The Netherlands AEX benchmark stock index has been rising sharply this year , outpacing impressive gains seen in broader European indexes . Conventional wisdom has it that these gains are a sign that asset managers assign a very low probability to a victory by Wilders and the Party for Freedom .   Here ’s a representative sample from CNBC : " The blase market reaction is because The blase market reaction ’s not a core economy like France or Germany , but The blase market reaction does set the table for the rest of the year , " said Jasper Lawler , senior market analyst at London Capital Group . " There ’s also a consensus that Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group wo n’t be able to form a [ coalition ] . I think that ’s why nobody ’s too worried . " " But even though I do n’t see an upset here , I do think markets are underpricing risk here , " he said . This echoes a lot of the commentary about how the market would crash in reaction to a Donald Trump victory . We now know that commentary got it backwards : markets boomed after Donald Trump won in November . Similarly , stocks in the U. K. rallied within days of the Brexit vote that many experts had predicted would bring doom to the British economy . In other words , markets appear to like    nationalism and populism . Instead of underpricing the " risk " of a Wilders victory , markets are more likely pricing in the odds of a Wilders victory as a positive factor . There ’s another reason to think Dutch stocks would rise with a Wilders victory . That begins with the observation that Wilders is often described as " the Dutch Trump . " With 21 % of the revenue of the companies in the AEX index derived from the U. S. according to a recent Wall Street Journal report , joining America ’s embrace of economic nationalism and populism is likely to lead to improved conditions for the businesses in the AEX index derived from the U. S. . It ’s always dangerous to project future events based on the movements of financial markets . But if there is a message in the Dutch stock market , it is likely that the chances of a Wilders win are stronger than polls and pundits suggest .
