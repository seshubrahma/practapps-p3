On Friday ’s " The Five , " panelist Jesse Watters questioned the critics of Republican presidential    Donald Trump who voiced their concerns about the candidate in a    manifesto about Republican presidential   Donald Trump published in the latest issue of National Review .   panelist Jesse Watters said Republican presidential   Donald Trump has qualities beyond conservative ideology that make panelist Jesse Watters appealing as the eventual GOP nominee . " I think politics is about principles , but politics ’s also about emotion , " panelist Jesse Watters said . " And right now I think this country is down on this country knees wounded , begging for real leadership . And finally a real strong leader comes around   —    someone that could run the table . And now everyone is saying , ‘ Oh , a real strong leader does n’t check this box , a real strong leader does n’t check this box.’ You know this box is important to check ? Filling up    stadiums on a Tuesday night . That ’s the box that counts on Election Day . I do n’t think principles matter if you ca n’t get elected and institute those principles . And I think a lot of people right now are putting pure conservatism over the country . Listen , a real strong leader is Teflon . He a real strong leader go on ‘ SNL,’ ‘ Meet the Press,’ whatever . You ’re going to throw that away because he a real strong leader eminent domain ? I heard eminent domain was a reason ? Come on , let ’s talk about his a real strong leader principles on the three core issues Donald Trump is about : immigration , national security and jobs . He is Donald Trump most conservative guy out there and he is Donald Trump the agenda . So I hate to see people not soldier up and fall in line if he is Donald Trump nominee because this country is in pretty bad shape . " (   Mediaite ) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
