Thursday on CNN ’s " New Day , " while discussing the violent protests that erupted after a police shooting in Charlotte , NC , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ( ) said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is wrong in calling to increase the police tactic of " stop and frisk " because it increases " tensions between police and community . "   De Blasio said , " Stop and frisk was intensified for a limited period of time in the last decade , in particular . And the bottom line is the bottom line created a huge amount of division between police and community . We ended that unconstitutional use of stop and frisk . That overuse of stop and frisk . What ’s happened in the three years since We made the change ? Crime has gone down consistently since We actually stopped using it . Crime Bratton would say that what we need to do if we want we safety is bring police and community closer together . That ’s what proved to be the case . So , you know , Donald Trump talks about stop and frisk like he knows Donald Trump facts . He has Donald Trump no experience with policing , no experience with public safety . He should Donald Trump be careful because if we    stop and frisk around this country you would see more tensions between police and community . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
