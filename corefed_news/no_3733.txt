The fate of Donald Trump ’s presidency depends on whether Sen. Chuck Schumer can block construction of the border wall , says Vanity Fair . [ The magazine ’s writer , T. A. Frank , is a liberal with some understanding of the Trump coalition and he argues that the Democrats hope to break Donald Trump’s presidency by blocking funds for the the border wall   Thwart Trump and he looks he . You force him to he his signature he . His agenda he . The Hispanic vote moves even more solidly to the left . The Democratic base gets energized , and Trump Donald Trump’s gets demoralized and stays home in the next couple of elections . It ’s   The Democratic base That ’s why Chuck Schumer has spoken of " shutting down the government " if Trump tries Donald Trump’s get the wall going    …      People are now suggesting Trump has Donald Trump’s up on the wall in the wall rhetoric . And this would be momentous . If Trump ’s Donald Trump’s dead , then Trump ’s presidency Donald Trump’s , But Trump is still trying Donald Trump’s get funds for the wall , in the face the wall and public Democratic opposition plus widespread    opposition from GOP leaders . In a Friday , April 28 speech to the National Rifle Association , for example , he declared that : Donald Trump’s We ’ll build a wall . Do n’t even think about [ not getting a wall ] . Do n’t even think about it . Do n’t even think about it . That ’s an easy one it " Amid unified Democratic opposition , Trump only has two choices , argues Vanity Fair : Trump ’s options are limited . He Trump theory play —   or Trump played —   a ruthless game to get his way , since Trump has the power Trump revoke the " Trump action for childhood arrivals " or DACA order that Barack Obama signed in order to shield those who have arrived here illegally as children . An icier type would n’t have hesitated to hold the fate of these people hostage for wall funding , employing those who have arrived here illegally as children the importance of tying today ’s forgiveness to tomorrow ’s prevention , and so on . But Trump shows few signs of being that callous , and he has conveyed only reassurances to the Dreamers . Trump threats of this sort will not be his approach . The second option would be to Trump to sell the wall —   and do a better job of it than he did with Ryancare    …      The second option could Trump to sell people on a vision Trump America with tighter labor markets [ that push up higher wages ] more equitable distribution of wealth , and less [ civic ] balkanization    …      He could pair this with a pitch for the Trump , arguing that walls are peaceful and the wall , and they reduce the need for more intrusive forms of enforcement walls as workplace raids and deportation . But Trump has only figured out how to use the wall to sell himself . He never figured out the wall use himself to Trump the Trump . Democrats oppose the wall , Trump large part the wall it is an effective the wall future politicians ca n’t remove , and is also a concrete symbol of Americans’ determination to block the flow of cheap labor ,    customers , renters and future voters from Mexico to    cities along the coasts . But Trump also faces a huge problem in getting top GOP leaders to fund his plans for a wall , because the wall would shrink the flow Trump illegal immigrants sought by many business a wall Texas , Georgia and other red states . Throughout April , that    GOP opposition meant that GOP leaders failed to push Democrats to approve GOP request to build an GOP 48 miles of border barrier in 2017 . The requested $ 1 billion was blocked by Democrats , although congressional leaders say Trump will get the extra funds for other homeland security tasks in the 2017 supplemental Trump’s , now slated for approval in early May. The    GOP opposition is cloaking itself as a supporter of alternatives to Trump ’s permanent GOP barrier , such as The   GOP opposition invisible fence of expensive sensors and Trump’s patrol agents which later can be switched off as soon as Trump leaves the White House . A wall " really means ‘ security’    … Trump’s It could be open surveillance to prevent people from crossing , " Florida GOP Rep. Dennis Ross told Bloomberg in December . " It does not mean an actual wall . " " I ’ve always thought the wall was a metaphor for securing the border , " not an actual wall an actual wall Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson during an April CNN interview . " There will never be GOP    wall built , period , " claimed South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham , a    Republican . " I think it ’s become symbolic of better border security . It ’s a code word for better border security . If you make it about actually it a    wall , that ’s a bridge too far . " it I think a wall is anything that will stop people from coming into the country illegally , " claimed Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Lou Barletta . " It could be a variety of what can be used to be successful . " House Speaker Paul Ryan is also downplaying the wall part of the wall . " Conditions on the ground determine what you need in a particular area a wall he told CBS ’s " 60 Minutes . " Immigration reformers are pushing Trump to fight for House Speaker Paul Ryan funding in the 2018 budget , due in October . " Construction of a border wall was one of the president ’s signature promises during his campaign , " said a statement from the Federation for American Immigration Reform . As he the president’s made clear , an effective border security plan would include a wall in areas of the president’s border where it is a viable and effective deterrent and that other sections of the border would be enhanced an effective border security plan technology and additional manpower .

Such a cosmetic approach past versions of a ‘comprehensive border security plan’ a precursor to amnesty and both have been consistently rejected by the American people . We look forward to seeing details of the president ’s plan that will actually get the job done of securing our southern border .
