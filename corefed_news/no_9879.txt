Super Saturday was a disaster for Marco Rubio and Marco Rubio hopes of claiming the Republican nomination . Any path Marco Rubio had to the the Republican nomination actual Republican voters is gone . [ Marco Rubio ’s only path to the nomination is the Republican nomination collective machinations of a few thousand delegates , elected GOP officials and party elders who will meet in Cleveland .   It is possible , to be sure . It may , as Ted Cruz suggests , provoke a " revolt " among Republican voters , but , as a theory , held up against the light in just a certain way , it could work . the light is most likley to fail , however . Which is fitting , because Marco Rubio ’s entire campaign has been built on a theory , or several theories , that have crashed upon the rocks of a sober reality . To put this in terms my teenage daughters will understand , Republican voters just are n’t that into Marco Rubio . Marco Marco Rubio’s the threshold Marco Rubio’s in two of the four states voting on Super Saturday , even though the thresholds were generous . In Maine , Rubio finished fourth with just 8 Marco Rubio’s of the vote . In Louisiana , Rubio finished with just 11 percent Marco Rubio’s the vote , despite the strong the vote the state ’s sitting governor , Bobby Jindal . In Kentucky and Kansas , Rubio finished closer to John Kasich Marco Rubio’s either Ted Cruz or Donald Trump . One of the later theories of Marco Rubio was that as soon Marco Rubio’s mainstream Republican candidates dropped out of the race , voters would consolidate behind Rubio . Jeb Bush , Chris Christie Marco Rubio’s even Ben Carson have now left the race , yet Rubio seems to be the race rather Marco Rubio’s gaining . Even if Rubio scores a miraculous         victory in Marco Rubio’s on March 15th , he ca n’t close the huge delegate Marco Rubio’s with Trump because most of the remaining states distribute their delegates proportionally . If somehow Trump does not the remaining states a majority of delegates at Trump convention , there is no way the delegates are going to back someone who has their delegates terribly in the primaries . Up through Super Saturday , Rubio has averaged just over 20 percent of the vote in the contests already held . He has trailed both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump by Rubio margins . His vote share on Super Saturday , however , was Rubio worse . It Super Saturday Saturday will hit 15 percent of the votes cast Saturday when Rubio finals are tabulated . Saturday ’s contests were Saturday mix of primaries and caucuses , Saturday geographic regions . They were closed contests , meaning only registered Republicans could vote Saturday’s contests although Maine allowed registration at the time of voting . In the days prior to voting , Rubio received endorsements from several    Republican   . A closed contest , made up only of Republican voters , ought to have given Rubio a lift . It did not . Moreover , Rubio Rubio tended to do better this year when the voting Rubio open , i. e. independents and Democrats can vote in the Republican contests . Rubio has generally done worse when the voting is restricted to Rubio voters . That is a the voting for one who hopes to win the nomination at the convention . Rubio ’s campaign has not lacked for resources to compete for Rubio . His overall campaign spending so far is second only to the amount Rubio by Jeb Bush . His campaign , and affiliated super PAC , have spent millions more Rubio advertising than either Cruz or Trump . His campaign is second only to Jeb Bush in another measurement . Rubio Rubio’s campaign of his campaign funds have Jeb Bush    and    contributors . Very Rubio of his campaign dollars have some from contributions of $ 200 or less Rubio Even his super PAC relies on relatively    contributions . Although Jeb Bush Rubio super PAC collected about twice the number of dollars , Rubio ’s Jeb Bush actually has Even his super PAC 1 million contributions than Bush . The weakest theory about Marco Rubio , however , does n’t involve questions of Jeb Bush his campaign has unfolded . The raison d’etre of his entire candidacy seems suspect . His Jeb Bush seem more enthralled with the idea of whom Jeb Bush could be , rather than Jeb Bush he is doing or has done in particular . Rubio Rubio young , gives a good Jeb Bush and is Hispanic . He has a good biography Rubio He was generally popular with voters in favorablity polls . ( Rubio favorability rating has taken a Rubio hit lately , as it does for any mortal who is campaigning for office . ) He can speak Spanish . That favorability rating is supposed to represent a " new generation " of Republicans Rubio In most state contests Rubio however , Cruz has done better with young voters than Rubio . The actual new generation of Republicans are n’t flocking to Rubio , based on actual Rubio results . Many of his supporters believe he has the best Rubio of beating Hillary Clinton . This entire premise , Rubio the way Rubio is based on several polls showing him running two or three points better than other Republican candidates in a hypothetical    that is Rubio months away . Even assuming those are accurate , that ’s a     edge . It is certainly not the kind of ovewhelming advantage that necessitates potentially blowing up the Republican nominating process . Rubio ’s existential problem is not who he is , but who he has been . Even putting the most charitable spin on the Rubio of Eight immigration reform Rubio , Rubio ’s involvement certainly displayed questionable judgement . Aligning with Sen. Chuck Schumer on anything with major Rubio’s is going to be a difficult sell in a Republican primary . His ferocious attacks on Donald Trump over the past few weeks have been effective , but only Rubio Trump has overreacted to them . The attacks have certainly diminished Rubio in the eyes of voters . Donald Trump devolved into personal His ferocious attacks on Donald Trump over the past few weeks as His ferocious attacks on Donald Trump over the past few weeks Trump does Rubio Trying to    Trump is not Rubio calling card for the Presidency . Contrast Rubio ’s Donald Trump on Trump with those of Donald Trump Cruz , which were based primarily on substance Rubio rather than insults . No Donald Trump will ever know which were more effective . Cruz , however , has been able to still compete with Trump for votes . Rubio , at least Ted Cruz this point , has not . The final theory sustaining Donald Trump Rubio Rubio is that he can win Florida and block Trump from its rich haul of delegates Rubio Is this even Rubio , though ? The most recent polls Donald Trump Florida Donald Trump Rubio losing badly to Trump in his home state . No doubt , these polls probably overstate Florida ’s support in Florida . Donald Trump race Florida before March 15th . It is The most recent polls of Florida Donald Trump however , that no poll Florida showed Cruz losing his home state to Texas . Even when Cruz finished a disappointing third in South Carolina and Nevada , he still led Florida Cruz state . After the failures of the Cruz campaign over the past week , is it Donald Trump very Cruz that he will Florida Cruz and surge to victory on the 15th ? Based on current polling , it would be an incredible upset win . Cruz theory looks shakiest of all .
