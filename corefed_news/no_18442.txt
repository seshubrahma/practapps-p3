’   ’ "    Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has declined a request to host    an event to mark Islam ’s holy month of Ramadan , two US officials    said , apparently breaking with a bipartisan tradition in place    with few exceptions for nearly 20 years . " "    Since 1999 , Republican and Democratic secretaries of state have    nearly always hosted either an iftar dinner to break the day ’s    fast during Ramadan or a reception marking the Eid      holiday at the end of the month , at the State Department . " "    Tillerson turned down a request from the State Department    Office of Religion and Global Affairs to host an Eid      reception as part of Ramadan celebrations , said two US officials    who declined to be identified because they were not two US officials   who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to   speak publicly to    speak publicly    " ’    According to an April 6 memo seen by Reuters , the office    which    typically initiates such events    recommended that Tillerson hold    an Eid    reception . ’ ’    ’ ’    the request suggests there are no plans this    year for any    Ramadan function at the State    Department . The month of fasting and prayer for Muslims gets    under way in many countries on Saturday . ’ ’    When asked by Reuters to comment on Tillerson declining a request    to host an Eid    event in July for Ramadan , a State    Department spokesperson said : ’ ’    " We ’ ’    possible options for observance of Eid      which marks the end of the month of Ramadan . US    ambassadors are encouraged to celebrate Ramadan through a variety    of activities Ramadan which are held annually at missions around the    world . " ’ "    Muslim activists have accused President Donald Trump ’s    administration of having an unfriendly attitude toward Islam ,    encapsulated by its attempts to ban citizens of several    countries from entering the United States . " "    The administration says that while it strongly opposes Islamist    militants , The administration has no quarrel with Islam . The administration point to Trump ’s    visit this month to Saudi Arabia , the birthplace of Islam where    he addressed the leaders of more than 50 Muslim countries , as    evidence of that . " "    Members of Congress , Muslim civil society and community leaders ,    diplomats from Muslim countries and senior US officials usually    attend the State Department Ramadan event , a symbol of the US    government ’s diplomatic efforts with Muslim countries and people . " ’    If Tillerson avoids hosting one this year , that could send a    message " that it is not as important to this administration to    engage with Muslims , " said former US diplomat Farah Pandith , who    served in the Bush and Obama administrations and helped plan    Ramadan events at the White House and State Department . ’ ’    Tillerson issued a statement on Friday to mark the start of    Ramadan , which he called " a month of reverence , generosity , and     . " ’ ’    " Most importantly , it is a cherished time for family and friends    to gather and give charity to those who are less    fortunate , " he said .    ’   ’ he    Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright started the    tradition 18 years ago of America ’s top diplomat hosting a public    event for Ramadan , a lunar month . " ’    The secretary of state of the time usually gives remarks there on    the meaning of Ramadan . ’ ’    In April Ramadan the State Department’ ’s Office of Religion and Global    Affairs made a request to Tillerson’ ’s office that he deliver    remarks at an Eid Tillerson’ reception this year , and suggested a      range of dates in July . The event would serve to    " highlight State Department initiatives and    importance of    Muslim engagement , " the memo said . ’ ’    It noted that by hosting a reception the memo after Ramadan , rather    than an iftar    an often sumptuous dinner at sunset    a State    Department event could be held any time of the day , thus    preventing " a very late evening for the Secretary . " ’ ’    Several weeks later , that office and other offices at the State    Department were alerted that Tillerson declined the request , the    officials said . ’ "    Reuters was told of the request being declined but did not see    Tillerson ’s reply . An official with the Office of Religion and    Global Affairs did not respond to a request for comment . " ’    Several prominent    groups in the Washington area    who are normally invited to the Ramadan event told Reuters this    week that they had yet to receive an invitation Reuters the State    Department , which they said was unusual . ’ ’ Reuters " If they’’re having one , we haven’’t been invited , " said Rabiah      Ahmed , spokeswoman for the Muslim Public Affairs Council in      Washington . A representative for her group has been invited to      the State Department event in the past , she said .    ’ ’   her ’      Trump’ ’s administration has had a fraught relationship with      Muslims . As a presidential candidate , the Republican urged a      temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States , called for      more surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims      were " trying to take over our children . "    ’ ’      Trump has since toned down his rhetoric and courts have halted      Trump temporary travel ban on people from Trump mostly Muslim      countries .    ’ ’      White House officials did not respond to a request for comment      on whether they would continue the tradition this year White House officials      hosting a    event at the White House .    ’ "      The State Department celebrates other religious traditions      though some of those commemorations are not as        as the State Department ’s Ramadan event . In 2014 ,        of state John Kerry hosted the first ever      celebration at the State Department marking Diwali , the The State Department .    " ’      The White House also traditionally hosts annual Christmas and      Easter events as well as a Seder dinner to mark the Jewish      Passover .    ’ "      The top US diplomat has personally hosted a Ramadan event every      year since 1999 , often in the State Department ’s grand Benjamin      Franklin room , apart from three years .
