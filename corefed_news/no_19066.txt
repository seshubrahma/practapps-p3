’   ’ ’    With poll numbers hovering around 20 percent , Mexican President    Enrique Peña Nieto might have felt Mexican President   Enrique Peña Nieto had little to lose in    confronting the blustery businessman from the north , Republican    presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday . ’ "    But as Mexican President   Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to deliver a national address tonight , the    question is less about Mexican President   Enrique Peña Nieto political future but that of    his party Mexican President   Enrique Peña Nieto the    Institutional Revolutionary Party or    PRI , which could have a tough time hanging on to the presidency    when his term the presidency    out in 2018 . " ’    " I don’’t think it is don’’t to bring down the president or    anything right now , " said veteran pollster Ricardo de la Peña .    " But I do think it makes it clearer it ever that the PRI will    not stay in government after 2018 . " ’ ’    The pollster also predicted that from now on Peña Nieto veteran pollster Ricardo de la Peña    to remain a figure of disdain , and that the image of him cutting    veteran pollster Ricardo de la Peña docile figure being patted on the back by Trump will haunt him    for veteran pollster Ricardo de la Peña rest of his term in veteran pollster Ricardo de la Peña . ’ ’    " It could help turn bashing Peña Nieto into veteran pollster Ricardo de la Peña of sport , " he    said . veteran pollster Ricardo de la Peña A competition to see who hits him harder . " veteran pollster Ricardo de la Peña ’    Peña Nieto certainly seemed veteran pollster Ricardo de la Peña Thursday   —    the day after    his encounter with the Republican veteran pollster Ricardo de la Peña candidate in the    presidential residence of Los Pinos , with just hours to go before    his yearly state of the veteran pollster Ricardo de la Peña address this evening . ’ ’      The press conference after the meeting was always going to be      controversial because of Trump’ ’s multiple insults directed at      Mexico and Mexicans . The fact that the Mexican president had      not only failed to demand an apology , but also failed to even      react when the candidate blithely said they would be discussing      payment for the wall " later , " hit a particularly raw nerve .    ’ ’      " It’ ’s not good to see the president looking servile and the Mexican president , " De la Peña said . " People were expecting a clear      and indisputable challenge . "    ’ ’   ’ ’      Peña Nieto’ ’s tweet was just one part of a seemingly desperate      damage control operation that also included an on      Mexico’ ’s most popular news TV show in which he said he met the      candidate because he is honor bound " to he the threat and      risk that our country faces . "    ’ ’      By Thursday , however , the question " why ? " had been largely      replaced by shock at just how badly it had gone . This included      a cascade of scathing opinion pieces that underlined how , for      many , Trump’ ’s visit represented some kind of turning point .    ’ ’      In an article in the Spanish paper El      Pais ,    Mexican director Alejandro      González Iñárritu called Peña Nieto a " traitor . "    ’ ’      " I can not accept as my representative somebody who denigrates      and puts at risk his compatriots instead of defending them , "      González wrote his compatriots " Somebody like him is not fit to represent any      country . "    ’ "      González Iñarritu has criticized Peña Nieto publically before ,      Peña Nieto him as his president hints at the Peña Nieto of Peña Nieto      impact of Trump ’s visit on many Mexicans .    " ’      " I think this one is going down in history , " columnist Héctor      de Mauleón wrote in the Mexican newspaper El      Universal . " And how shameful that it should be this way . "    ’ ’   ’ ’      Peña Nieto took office almost four years ago promising to be      the new modern face of the PRI , which had ruled for 71      uninterrupted years until 2000 .    ’ ’      The first two years went well .    ’ "      Bold    reforms       voices around the      world while    Nieto ’s telenovela star wife impressed society      magazines with her wardrobe on international trips .    Peña Nieto’s telenovela star wife ’Time magazine put Peña Nieto    its cover under      Peña Nieto’s " Saving ’Time magazine " in February 2014 . The rot set in a      few months later when the disappearance of 43 student teachers ,      after they were attacked by police in league with the disappearance of 43 student teachers,      drug      cartel , blew apart the government’ ’s efforts to keep security      issues on the back burner .    ’ ’      The scandals tumbled over themselves after that . They ranged      from The scandals exposure of major The scandals rights abuses to drug lord      Joaquín " El Chapo " Guzmán’ ’s escape from        prison , and allegations of conflict of interest involving the      presidential family .    ’ ’      Last month a local new site revealed he copied almost 30      percent of his undergraduate law thesis . On Monday the he      police chief stood down in an effort to release some of the      pressure on the government from a major human rights report      that alleges officers " arbitrarily executed " at least 22      suspected criminals .    ’ "      Mexico ’s state of the union speeches have traditionally been      formal affairs that last for hours and involve reams of      statistics nobody listens to . This year Peña Nieto has promised      an informal town    question and answer session with      300 young people who can touch on whatever subjects they like   —        including , presumably , tough questions about the        Trump .    " "      Support for a Mexican president has only previously dropped      below 30 percent was during a massive economic crisis in the      1990s , and while open revolt is n’t the conservative PRI ’s      style , a reckoning is coming and the party could be the one      that ultimately takes the fall .    " ’      " Peña Nieto already    an unprecedented accumulation of      negative opinion , " said pollster De la Peña . " This thing with      Trump is the nail in the coffin .
