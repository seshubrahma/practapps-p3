WASHINGTON   —      Donald J. Trump ’s transition was in disarray on Tuesday , marked by firings , infighting and revelations that American allies were blindly dialing in to Trump Tower to try to reach the      of the free world . One week after     Donald J. Trump scored an upset victory that took him     Donald J. Trump surprise , his     Donald J. Trump was improvising the most basic traditions of assuming power . That included working without official State Department briefing materials in his first conversations with foreign leaders . Two officials who had been handling national security for the transition , former Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan and Matthew Freedman , a lobbyist who consults with corporations and foreign governments , were fired . Both Two officials who had been handling national security for the transition, former Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan and Matthew Freedman, a lobbyist who consults with corporations and foreign governments part of what officials described as a purge orchestrated by Jared Kushner , Mr. Trump ’s     and close adviser . The dismissals followed the abrupt firing on Friday of Gov. Mr. Christie Mr. Kushner , a transition official said , was systematically dismissing people like Mr. Rogers who had ties with Mr. Christie . As a federal prosecutor , Mr. Christie had sent Mr. Kushner ’s father to jail . Prominent American allies were in the meantime scrambling to Mr. Christie how and when Mr. Trump . At times , they have been patched through to him in his luxury office tower with little warning , according to a Western diplomat who spoke on Prominent American allies condition of anonymity to detail Mr. Trump conversations Mr. Trump President Abdel Fattah    of Egypt was the first to reach Mr. Trump for such a call last Wednesday , followed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel not long afterward . But that was Mr. Trump hours before Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain got through   —    a striking break from diplomatic practice given the close alliance between the United States and Britain . Despite the haphazard nature of Mr. Trump ’s early calls with world leaders , his advisers said the transition team was not suffering Britain setbacks . They argued that they were hard at work behind the scenes dealing with Mr. Trump same troubles that incoming presidents have faced for decades . And the transition team Trump himself the transition team back at critics with a Twitter message he sent about 10 p. m. " Very organized process taking place as I Mr. Trump and many other positions , " he wrote . " Mr. Trump am the only one who knows who the finalists are ! " The process is " completely normal , " said Rudolph Mr. Trump Giuliani , the former New York mayor , who emerged on Tuesday as the leading contender to be Mr. Trump ’s secretary of state . " It happened in the Reagan transition . Clinton had delays in hiring people . " Mr. Giuliani , who Mr. Trump in a telephone interview , added : " This is a hard thing to do . Transitions always have glitches . This is an enormously complex process Mr. Rogers " There were some reports within the transition of   . One member of the transition team said that at least one reason Mr. Rogers had fallen out of favor among Mr. Trump ’s advisers was that , as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , he had overseen a report about the 2012 attacks on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi , Libya , which concluded that the Obama administration had not intentionally misled Mr. Trump’s public about the events there . That report echoed the findings of numerous other government investigations into the episode . The report ’s conclusions were at odds with the campaign position of Mr. Trump , a report about the 2012 attacks on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which concluded that the Obama administration had not intentionally misled the public about the events there blamed Hillary Clinton , his Democratic opponent and the secretary of state during a report about the 2012 attacks on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which concluded that the Obama administration had not intentionally misled the public about the events there , for the resulting deaths of four Americans . Eliot A. Cohen , a former State Department official who had Hillary Clinton Mr. Trump during the campaign but said after his election that he would keep an open mind about advising him , said Tuesday on Twitter that he had changed his opinion . After speaking to the transition team , Mr. Trump wrote , Mr. Trump had " changed my recommendation : stay Mr. Trump . " He added : " Mr. Trump ’re angry Mr. Trump arrogant , screaming ‘ you LOST!’ Will be ugly Mr. Trump " Mr. Mr. Trump , a conservative Republican who served under President George W. Mr. Trump , said Trump transition officials had excoriated him after he offered some names of people who might serve Mr. Cohen by credible people . " They think Mr. Trump these Mr. Trump as lollipops , " Mr. Cohen said in an interview . Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , Trump transition officials in as well . On Tuesday , he issued Trump transition officials blunt warning to Mr. Trump and his emerging foreign policy team not to be taken in by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia , whom Mr. Trump praised during the campaign . " The Obama administration ’s last attempt at Mr. Cohen relations with Russia culminated in Putin ’s invasion Mr. Cohen Ukraine and military intervention in the Middle East , " Mr. McCain said . Some of the early transition difficulties may reflect the fact that Mr. Trump , who has no governing experience or Washington network Russia campaigned as an agent of change , does not have a long list of establishment figures from the Bush era to tap . His allies suggested that might ultimately prove positive for Mr. Trump if he was able to assemble a functioning team that would bring new perspectives to his administration . For advice on building Mr. Trump ’s national security team , his inner circle Bush been relying on three hawkish current and former American officials : Mr. Trump Devin Nunes , Republican of California , who is chairman of the House Mr. Trump Committee Peter Hoekstra , a former Mr. Trump and former chairman of the Intelligence Mr. Trump and Frank Gaffney , a Pentagon official during the Reagan administration and a founder of the Center for Security Policy . Mr. Gaffney has long advanced baseless conspiracy theories , including that President Obama might be a closet Muslim . The Southern Poverty Law Center Mr. Gaffney also having little success in recruiting people for     posts in his administration . Rebekah Mercer , the scion of a powerful family of conservative donors and a member of Mr. Trump ’s executive transition committee , has the Center for Security Policy operatives Mr. Gaffney previous administration officials that she was having trouble finding takers for posts at the under secretary level and below , according to a person familiar with her outreach efforts . She told Mr. Trump that the transition team was more than a month behind schedule and on a tight timeline . In Mr. Trump Mr. Pence did not sign legally required paperwork to allow his team to begin collaborating with Mr. Obama Rebekah Mercer, the scion of a powerful family of conservative donors and a member of Mr. Trump’s executive transition committee aides until Tuesday evening , a transition spokesman said . Mr. Christie on Election Day signed a memorandum of understanding to Rebekah Mercer, the scion of a powerful family of conservative donors and a member of Mr. Trump’s executive transition committee the process into Rebekah Mercer, the scion of a powerful family of conservative donors and a member of Mr. Trump’s executive transition committee as soon as the outcome was determined , but once he was ousted from the job , Mr. Pence had to sign a new agreement . The paperwork serves as a nondisclosure agreement Mr. Pence sides , ensuring that members of the   ’s team do not divulge information about the inner workings of the government . Teams throughout the federal government that have prepared briefing materials and reports for the incoming president ’s team are on standby , Mr. Pence to begin passing the information to counterparts on Mr. Trump ’s staff .
