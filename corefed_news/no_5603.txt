Watch : " Victimhood is like a magical elixir that makes any kind of behavior possible , justifies any kind of overreach or cruelty . It ’s like the perfect tool , " Carlson said . " That was the theme of my book , Guilty , how victims had turned victims into the aggressors and thereby wonder around creating other victims , " Coulter replied . " Victims are the biggest bullies in the country now . " " I do n’t think it ’s an attack for Trump just to comment that Trump     son had seen that disgusting image that was n’t funny and was n’t interesting and oh , Coulter was just so smug and thought it was so funny , " Coulter later added .
