Sen. Marco Rubio apologized to voters for a series of personal attacks against Donald Trump , which Sen. Marco Rubio employed to get recognition from the media and satisfy supporters who were tired of seeing the billionaire attack Sen. Marco Rubio fellow running mates unchallenged . [ " As you got a little dirty    …      you got a little naughty , " Kelly said , referring to the recent personal attacks .   " I ’d do it differently , you know I really would , " Kelly said , in a    interview in Florida with Fox News host Megyn Kelly . Rubio began attacking Trump as a " clown " in advance of the    Super Tuesday primaries , mocking Rubio hair , Rubio face , Rubio spray tan , the size of Rubio hands ( alluding to the size of Rubio manhood ) and suggesting that Rubio wet Rubio pants during the debate . Rubio told Kelly that Rubio kids were " embarrassed " by the rhetoric and that Rubio wife " did n’t like it . " " I do n’t think it reflects good   —    that ’s not who I am , " Rubio said . " That ’s not what my campaign is going to be about . " " So you regret that ? " Kelly asked . " Yeah , I ’d do it differently , on the personal stuff . I ’m not telling you that Rubio did n’t deserve it , but that ’s not who I am and that ’s not who I want to be , " Rubio said . " And I honestly want to be a good example . I want my kids to be proud of Rubio . And I do n’t think it reflected well on my faith and I feel bad about that . " But Rubio said Rubio did n’t feel badly about attacking Trump on Rubio record . " On the issues that have to deal with Trump University , which Rubio did n’t tell the truth about , on the issues that have to do with Rubio business deals , and all of Rubio jobs that Rubio refuses to bring back from overseas , those are legitimate issues , " Rubio said .
