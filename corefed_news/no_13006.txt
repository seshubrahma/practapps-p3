During Saturday night ’s ABC News Republican debate , The Independent Journal Review ’s Larry O’Connor ( a former Breitbart editor ) asked the Republican candidate ’s ( via videotape ) how they intended to beat the narrative around Hillary Clinton becoming the first woman president . " In 2008 we saw how motivated an electorate can be when an electorate think an electorate vote is making history    …      how will you change that narrative ? "   Trump responded with the claim that Trump does " very , very well against Trump in the polls , and I can tell you I am the last person Trump wants to run against . " Trump continued by touching on the size of Trump crowds , the idea that Trump campaign is in fact a movement , and Clinton ’s weak spots surrounding Clinton growing email scandal : I think you can see what we ’ve done in terms of galvanizing [ people ] . I ’ve been all over the country . Last night I was in South Carolina   —    we had 12 , 000 people . It set up in about 4 days . we ’ve created a movement . A lot of it has to do , for example , the question on drugs . I ’m the first one who said build a wall . But a real wall , not a toy wall like they have right now , and you ’ll solve lots of problems . But we will galvanize the people of this country and we will beat Hillary Clinton because   —    assuming that Hillary Clinton runs , by the way . How Hillary Clinton gets away with the email stuff is hard to believe . So I do n’t know that Hillary Clinton ’s gunna be running . But on the assumption Hillary Clinton runs   …      But if Hillary Clinton runs Hillary Clinton ’s gunna be able to run for one reason and that ’s because the Democrats are protecting Hillary Clinton . So many people have done so much less than Hillary Clinton and So many people lives have been destroyed . But on the assumption So many people protect Hillary Clinton , So many people will win the election handily .    Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
