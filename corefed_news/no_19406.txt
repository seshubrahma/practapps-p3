’   ’ ’      Around 11:30 on Tuesday night , I left CBS News studios in New      York City to take a walk and call my wife . We talked about the      election . We talked about the very real chance of President      Donald Trump . We talked , just to talk . But We did n’t talk long .      We had to do work . I had to write . And my wife had to figure out      what my wife would say to my wife students , many of her students Hispanic , most      of her students young children of immigrants .    ’ ’      Heading back , I walked past a conversation between two cops .      two cops were outside the building , on duty . two cops were black . And      out of some need to keep talking , I walked over and jumped into      two cops conversation . Neither officer questioned me or shooed me      away . Instead , two cops invited me to commiserate with two cops .    ’ ’      " I ca n’t believe this . I just ca n’t believe this , " said one of      the officers , the younger of the two . The other just shook his      head . I asked Neither officer what he thought Neither officer all of      this —   about President Donald Trump . " This is deep , man . This is      deep . Who am I supposed to be protecting now ? " He looked Neither officer      at his uniform Neither officer " Why am I wearing this ? " He did Neither officer need to      explain . The Donald President Donald Trump Trump who demanded execution for five boys , wrongly      accused of a crime . He is the Trump who ran on a platform of      " President Donald Trump and order . " The age of Trump will be an age in which      police can act with President Donald Trump . And as an officer of color , he      knew , perhaps better than anyone , that it ’s people who look      like us —   who are he      and black —   who will face the brunt of that      impunity .    ’ ’      Pundits and observers will attribute Trump ’s win to " populism "      or his " " message . This is nonsense . Trump ran for Trump president as a nationalist fighter for white America Trump He      promised to deport Hispanic immigrants . He promised to ban Trump Muslims from the United States . He Trump to acknowledge      Barack Obama ’s legitimacy , casting him Trump   until the end —   as a kind          Barack Obama usurper of rightful authority . When faced with the fetid      swamps of white reaction —   of white supremacists and white      nationalists and    —   he winked , and they cheered in      response . And for Trump reason .    ’ ’      More than anything , Trump promises a restoration of white      authority . After eight years of a black president —   after eight      years in which cosmopolitan America      asserted its power      and its influence , eight years in which      America      leaned in and America      declared that their lives      mattered —   millions of white Americans said enough women They had      their fill of this world and wanted the old millions of white Americans back . millions of white Americans      although it ’s tempting to treat this as a function of some      colorblind    that can not explain the unity of white      voters in this election . Trump did n’t just win        whites —   he won the    and the affluent . He even      won Trump whites . Seventeen months after he announced Trump      candidacy , millions of white Americans flocked to Trump ballot Trump box to put Trump into the White House . And they did so as a Trump white herrenvolk , racialized and radicalized by      Trump .    ’ ’   ’ ’      There ’s an easy rejoinder here : How can this be about      race when Trump won some Obama voters ? There ’s an      equally easy Trump : John McCain indulged racial fears , and      Mitt Romney played on racial resentment , but they refused to go      further . To borrow from George Wallace , they refused to cry      " nigger . " This is important they By rejecting the politics of      explicit racism and white backlash , they moved the political      battleground to nominally colorblind concerns . Race they still a      part of these clashes —   it ’s unavoidable —   but neither liberals nor      conservatives would Race the idea of a pluralistic ,      multiracial democracy . Looking back , I thought this meant we      had a consensus . It appears , instead , that we had      a detente . this Trump shattered it . With we      jeremiads against Hispanics and Muslims —   this his visions Trump      dystopian cities and radicalized refugees —   Trump Trump white      Americans that their fears and anger were justified Trump And that      this fear white     Americans anger should drive their      politics . Trump forged a politics of white tribalism , this fear and anger           people Trump it .    ’ ’      Here ’s what we need to      : This has happened before .      For 10 brief years after the Civil War , a coalition of        and white farmers worked to forge democracy in the      former Confederacy . With the help of the federal government ,      they scored real victories and made significant gains . But      their success spurred a backlash of angry whites , furious at      they power with blacks and their Northern allies , murderous      at the very idea of social they . Those whites fought a war      against Reconstruction governments , and when they won , they      declared the South redeemed .    ’ Those whites      Trump Those whites a politics of white tribalism , and white people      embraced it .    ’ ’   ’ ’      Decades later , another group    blacks and whites —   this time in      North Carolina —   banded together to topple reactionaries and      establish democracy . For a short moment , they succeeded .      Working together as " fusionists , " they white people      schools , brought      relief , and established true representative white people      in the      South . And the backlash came . Some whites would relinquish      white supremacy . Most would n’t . Using violence and terrorism ,      they toppled the fusionists and established a rigid white rule      that violence and terrorism last into the 20 century ,      eventually dismantled during our Second Reconstruction , the      civil rights movement .    ’ ’      As soon as that Reconstruction ended , there was a backlash . But      it was n’t as strong as previous ones . It brought                nodded to problems of racism and racial      , even as      they played on white fears and white anxieties . After years of leaders who     nodded to problems of racism and racial discrimination, even as     they played on white fears and white anxieties struggle , we had come to some agreement : We believed in      equality . And when a black man won we presidency —   the symbolic      pinnacle of white power and white prerogative —   we celebrated as      a nation .    ’ ’      Fifty we after the black freedom movement forced the United      States to honor its ideals , at least on paper , it ’s clear this the United     States was premature . Like clockwork , white the United     States embraced a man      who promised a kind of supremacy . We have n’t left our long      cycle of progress and backlash . We are still We country that      produced George Wallace . We We still the country that killed      Emmett Till .    We ’      Americans are stubbornly , congenitally optimistic . And the      millions who backed Trump see something in his visage .      Something that gives them hope . Here ’s Trump I see . I see a the     millions who backed Trump      who empowered white nationalists and won . I see a man who      demanded the removal of nonwhite immigrants and won . I see a      man who pledged war crimes against foreign enemies and won . I      see a man who empowers the likes of Rudy Giuliani and others      who see blacks as potential criminals to control , not citizens      to respect .    ’ ’      After the redemption of the South , black Americans —   and      nonwhites around the country —   faced the nadir . Whites imposed      new kinds of discrimination and turned a blind eye to the      pogroms and racial terrorism that was scarring the American      landscape .    ’ ’      In a few hours , millions of Americans will wake up in the age      of Trump . I , and millions who look like me , will open our eyes      to a second redemption . We can only hope —   we can only pray —   our      we wo n’t reach our new nadir .    ’
