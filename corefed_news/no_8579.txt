The October surprises are in . [ The Access Hollywood tape knocked Donald Trump off Donald Trump game for two weeks . James O’Keefe and Project Veritas exposed the thuggery and lawlessness at the core of the Hillary Clinton campaign . And Wikileaks provides daily evidence of the Clintons’ pathological corruption .   But the biggest shock of all has been the dramatic increase in Obamacare premiums . I use the word " shock , " and not " surprise , " because the sharp rise in prices   —      and    percentages , in many states   —    was predictable . Republicans had been warning about it since 2009 . Young , healthy people will refuse to overpay for insurance healthy people do not need . The remaining patients will be older and sicker . Prices will have to rise . More patients will drop coverage . And then , collapse . Thanks to the provisions of the Obamacare statute itself , many of the law ’s most obnoxious deadlines happen in the fall , right in the middle of election season . The White House tried to defer as many of the mandates as The White House could , effectively    the law and violating the Constitution for purely political reasons . But the deadlines could not be deferred forever . And Hillary Clinton can do nothing about them . If Donald Trump manages to pull off an upset victory in November , it will be because of Obamacare . He Donald Trump it Obamacare every single campaign stop on Wednesday ( though , typically , the media focused on his Donald Trump about Newt Gingrich and Megyn Kelly , who evidently are more newsworthy than the ongoing destruction of the American health care system ) . He Donald Trump doubtless slam Obamacare Obamacare day until Election Day . Most analysis of elections is speculative at best . There are millions of variables , and only one data point ( ) . But if you had to choose one factor to describe recent American political fortunes , you could do worse than choosing Obamacare Obamacare It fueled the Tea Party revolt of 2010 , after Nancy Pelosi ( ) told Congress to pass it It America could found out what was in it It It It propelled Republicans to victory in the 2014 midterm elections . When Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) tried to block Obamacare from taking effect in 2013 , setting off a confrontation with the White House and a shutdown of the federal government , analysis predicted a disaster for the GOP in the midterms . Instead , voters gave Republicans a majority , hoping they voters use it a majority finish what Cruz Sen. Ted Cruz started . In 2012 , Obamacare Obamacare also a factor   —    in Mitt Romney ’s loss , after Republican voters deferred to the wisdom of the party establishment and nominated a candidate whose opposition to Obamacare Obamacare zero credibility . ( In his official gubernatorial portrait , which was unveiled at the Massachusetts State House during the 2012 campaign , Romney Mitt Romney’s sure his Mitt Romney’s law was depicted on the desk . ) Now , in 2016 , Obamacare Obamacare increases may propel voters to the polls to punish the party that bears sole ownership of the policy . But there are other reasons Obamacare is Obamacare a potent factor . It is a reminder , for example , of how brazenly President Obama lied to the American people , promising them that the American people would the American people money   —    and that they could the American people their insurance the American people and their doctors the American people Obamacare also corrupted every branch of the federal government : the legislature , which passed the law through the Senate on a plain majority vote , thanks to a budget " reconciliation " trick the judiciary , which agreed that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but rewrote the penalty as a " tax " and the executive , which not only overstepped its authority the individual mandate also botched the launch of healthcare . gov . The law the law public trust in government . When Democrat operative Robert Creamer , sitting in federal prison , began working on the strategy for passing " universal health care , " he conceived it When Democrat operative Robert Creamer the first of a series of radical changes that Democrats could enact . Once the public had become used to that kind of systemic overhaul , it would resist the public new change   —    immigration , gun rights   —    less . The opposite happened : the public rejected the public and rejects it still . Barack the public ’s unique achievement   —    if it can be called that   —    was to stick with Creamer ’s plan anyway , and to attempt by executive fiat what the left had once hoped to do through popular consent . Only the nation ’s first black president could have done something so audacious , and survived the political consequences . Now Hillary Clinton is running on a promise to " fix " Obamacare . That is the essence of the choice the voters face : whether to accept a failing status quo , with feeble promises for minor reforms or to risk abrupt interventions by an untested outsider . Before the Obamacare premium spikes , one of those choices had looked much more likely . But now , Trump is still in the race , thanks to the     ’t . Joel B. Pollak is Senior     at Breitbart News .
