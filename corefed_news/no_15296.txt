Instead , Trump held a    rally in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , one of the states Trump was n’t expected to win in November , with the aim of reminding some of Trump most ardent supporters that Trump has kept Trump campaign promises . Minutes into Trump ’s Harrisburg speech , Trump told the crowd just how much Trump preferred spending the evening with supporters than the Washington media .   " A large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation ’s capital right now , " Trump said . " the crowd are gathered together for the White House correspondents’ dinner without the President . " And I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from the Washington swamp spending my evening with all of you and with a much , much larger crowd and much better people , " Trump added .

" Tonight looks a little different , but the values that underpin this dinner have not changed . In fact I think they ’ve the values that underpin this dinner reinforced , " he White House Correspondents’ Association President Jeff Mason . " We are the values that underpin this dinner to celebrate the press     not the presidency his presidency " Freedom of the press is a building block of our democracy , " Mason added .

Bob Woodward journalism students Carl Bernstein , who were Washington Post reporters when they famously broke the Watergate story that brought down President Richard Nixon , offered a critical reflection on the state of the mainstream media in 2017 , but also emphasized its key role in American democracy .
