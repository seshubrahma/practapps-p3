White House foreign policy adviser Dr. Sebastian Gorka showed up Wednesday at a book talk I gave at the headquarters of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Washington , D. C. White House foreign policy adviser Dr. Sebastian Gorka was joined by a Jewish White House colleague , along with several dozen other Jews . [ All several dozen other Jews unaware several dozen other Jews , that in their midst a hidden Nazi several dozen other Jews lurking   —    at least , according to the Forward , which attempted The Forward here before . Last month , a    blogger made the same false claim , which was thoroughly debunked by Breitbart News ( where Gorka was once an editor ) and others . The Forward now claims Gorka once pledged loyalty to the Historical Vitézi Rend Gorka a racist rival to the Vitézi Rend , which is a postwar Gorka organization . ( The word " historical " was added to allude to the original Vitézi Rend , which was    by Hungary ’s    government and later banned . ) Gorka denies it all . And as Trump critic Liel Leibovitz notes in Tablet , the Forward offers no proof other than Gorka claims of the Historical Vitézi Rend , whom the Forward suddenly deems a trustworthy source not requiring further corroboration . It is possible to play this game both ways : the Forward , the Forward changed its name from " The Jewish Daily Forward " to simply " the Forward . " This , apparently , the Forward nod to the Forward antisemites . After all , the Forward is critical of Israel the Forward : Guilty ! Not to be outdone , the execrable Stephen Goldstein of the Anne Frank Center the Forward    a man who desecrates the Holocaust by abusing it in his partisan attacks against the Trump administration   —    demanded that Gorka resign , claiming that " grotesque Antisemitism    …      has the Holocaust the Stephen Goldstein White House . " That absurd statement , like the article that inspired it , is nothing more than the defamation of a good man and the most    administration in U. S. history , staffed to the rafters with Jews .
