A group of popular Facebook meme pages have launched a revolt against Facebook ’s increasingly strict and bizarre censorship . [ The revolt , which includes some of Facebook ’s biggest comedy pages , aims to catch Facebook attention in a show of dissatisfaction with the social network ’s current policy enforcement system .   " I have gone through a lot of post blocks and seen a lot of friends getting into issues with losing their friends or pages even over the most inoffensive posts like this picture of Drake as a n64 controller that got my post blocked , " said one of the revolt ’s organizers , Devin Shire , in an interview with Breitbart Tech .   " Originally we only had my page Young Thugga La Meme , Everything Is A Social Construct , another page I admin Chair Memes , Digiannantonio Aesthetic , and Kevin 3 I believe , then we we reaching out to everybody we we who had pages and had them pages out to every other page admin they pages , " he Everything Is A Social Construct . " It was not easy trying to talk some pages into being apart of this because a lot of them pages the backlash they pages receive from Facebook for trying to stand up for this issue . " Since the revolt started , numerous other popular pages have also joined in , including " POLANDBALL , " which has over 300 , 000 likes , " I play KORN to my DMT plants , smoke blunts all day   do sex stuff , " which has over 100 , 000 likes , and " I ’m sad and I listen to Loveless every night , " which has over 40 , 000 likes . Most of the numerous other popular pages changed their profile numerous other popular pages to include a pink upside down Facebook logo , which is the icon of the revolt . In July , a popular Facebook page called " Meninist , " which had nearly 400 , 000 likes , was permanently suspended for their profile picture of a man with a beard , only to be reinstated after Breitbart Tech called Facebook out on the bizarre move . In the same month , a meme page mocking Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was also removed , with the social network citing an inoffensive joke image as the reason for deletion . Numerous other examples of Facebook censorship Facebook taken place almost daily , including the suspension of gay conservative Lucian Wintrich after he used Lucian Wintrich word " fag , " the removal of a men ’s rights conference page on the day of the conference , the censorship and restriction of WikiLeaks links , and the deletion of    and even    content . Despite the crackdown on harmless and inoffensive content , Facebook has refused to deal with real infringements upon their policies Facebook The social Facebook remove a cartoon posted by the Black Panther Party of Mississippi ’s page in July that portrayed a man in a black robe and mask slitting the throat of a police officer . " We reviewed the post Facebook reported for promoting graphic violence and found it does n’t violate graphic violence Community Standards , " said Facebook after the image was reported by numerous users . " I think attempting to censor people in these ways is very counterproductive , " said Shire . " I think they believe this is people na help discourse on these social media sites , but I think this is hurting them this the long people .
