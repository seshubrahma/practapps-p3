DES MOINES , Iowa   —    Billionaire Donald Trump , the frontrunner for the GOP nomination this year who ’s duking it out with his closest challenger Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) may have built a statewide army in Iowa that nobody in the national media has tracked . [ While Cruz ’s ground game is something to behold —   every honest political observer is blown away by what the    Senator from Texas has been able to build here in the Hawkeye State —   Trump ’s grassroots team has gone largely unnoticed by everyone .   Both Cruz and Trump’s said in interviews on Sunday shows the day before the caucuses that Both Cruz and Trump do n’t view an Iowa win as essential to Both Cruz and Trump getting the nomination . But most    political observers in Iowa , including many from rival campaigns , while loathe to make public predictions have told Breitbart News over the past few days Both Cruz and Trump believe this is a    race between Trump and Cruz . With Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) lowering expectations significantly , and Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) campaign saying Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) ’s only trying for third place now , it ’s down to Cruz and Trump . Ground game is everything , too , and many insiders in Iowa say Trump may pull Trump off . Everyone will have Everyone answer on Monday night . And the answer may come down to whether Trump has the    to carry Trump over the top . " Cruz does have the bodies on the ground and Cruz ’s had them here in the state for the final month , month and a half , " Craig Robinson of the Iowa Republican blog , who ’s also the former executive director of the state GOP , said on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot this weekend . these two campaigns can churn through and do that . The difference between these two campaigns is is numbers versus local . So the Trump campaign , I think , has done a better job of finding local people in these areas —   so local people ’re activating other people ’s networks to turn other people’s out and using that Iowan to Iowan type of effort versus Cruz who I think has a tremendous amount of passionate supporters who have all dropped what local people ’re doing , come to Iowa , and helped this guy out . So I think at the end of the day , I think local people ’re going to balance out . I think the     stuff is a little bit more valuable . Robinson said that the average person who ’s organizing for Trump statewide is over 40 years old and has spent decades living in the communities they are organizing . " The Trump field staffer , the person who ’s organizing certain areas to get out the vote , the average age is over 40 years of age , " Robinson said . So The Trump field staffer, the person who’s organizing certain areas to get out the vote have an older campaign —   that means The Trump field staffer, the person who’s organizing certain areas to get out the vote ’ve lived in these communities The Trump field staffer, the person who’s organizing certain areas to get out the vote entire lives , who are organizing . I do n’t know if it was done on purpose or just was happenstance . But I think it allows these people , these people ’ve been around a long time , so you ’re not relying on some kid to come in or someone from out of state to organize an area for you . You ’ve got someone who is engrained in that community doing that stuff . Cruz ’s abnormally impressive ground game —   most presidential election years do n’t see any candidate here building the structural operation that Cruz has organized —   includes more than 5 , 000 volunteers , according to Campbell . " There ’s 1 , 500 precincts in Iowa and we ’ve already recruited over 1 , 000 precinct chairs , an over    leadership team , and 2 , 300 coalition members , " Campbell previously told Breitbart News . " We just cracked 100 state we and pastors . We ’re past 5 , we volunteers . The other thing that we ’ve done , is we got 700 volunteers to we in from around the country . Between them and our Iowa volunteer 700 volunteers to come in from around the country , we ’re able to make we of calls . " Because of that amazing organizational structure , Cruz —   as most in media have expected for some time until very recently with a Trump revival in Iowa —   could easily Iowa with pure    barrel into a    win by bringing an overwhelming team of    out on Monday night . " The Trump people have always believed they were five points down The Trump people Cruz but that they would perform well because The Trump people ’re not going to be able to find those untraditional caucus goers in these polls , " Robinson said in the interview , which happened before the Des Moines Register poll showed Trump five points above Cruz Trump " So I Cruz if Trump has a    lead Trump in the Des Moines Register poll ] things look really good for him . " Cruz ’s Trump is expecting Cruz be around 135 , 000 voters —   an increase from last    in 2012 . The weather forecast on Monday evening hints that there may be snow in Iowa , which could drive turnout for the caucuses down —   providing an advantage to Cruz . Essentially , the thinking Cruz , the lower the turnout overall , the better for Cruz —   who has the Cruz calculated ground game effort . " The Cruz campaign has done extensive modeling Cruz the caucuses and believes the turnout the caucuses fall between 133 , 000 and 137 , 000 , " National Review ’s Tim Alberta wrote . Republicans familiar with Cruz ’s analytics program say his Cruz modeled caucus electorates all the Republicans familiar with Cruz’s analytics program up to 175 , 000 out of an abundance of caution , and feels confident that its man will prevail even if turnout reaches Republicans familiar with Cruz’s analytics program high . The reason : Cruz will hold a lead of roughly Cruz , 000 votes over Trump with a GOP electorate of 125 , 000 , his allies say . Trump would need to Trump with a GOP a huge plurality Trump —    if not a majority   —    of additional votes in order to offset Cruz ’s lead . But Robinson , Cruz interview with Breitbart News’ Executive Chairman Stephen K. Robinson on Breitbart News Saturday this weekend , predicted the turnout number will be much higher for sure —   at least 150 , 000 , he says —   and perhaps even higher than Robinson . " Our open U. S. Senate primary in 2014 had 154 , 000 people turn out at it , " Robinson said . " So , Our open U. S. Senate primary in 2014 ’d be Robinson that as Republicans this is Our to perform like primary . To me , the 150 , 000 [ estimated turnout ] is the safe number . I think it could be much higher than that . " When asked if higher turnout benefits Trump , Robinson said " oh yeah . Yeah . Absolutely Robinson " " This all dependent on Trump ’s ability to turn out new people , Trump Robinson added . There ’s no metric you can Robinson apply though to figure that out . The Trump campaign is not telling people to go change Trump registration . This is where Chuck Laudner is really savvy . What they ’re telling their people , they ’re giving The Trump campaign voter registration The Trump campaign , telling The Trump campaign to fill The Trump campaign out , register as Republican The Trump campaign take it voter registration forms your caucus night because the little trick voter registration forms the state party had to print its list long ago . So you run the the state party of really frustrating the voter if they change their voter registration to participate and then the voter show the voter but they say ‘ Hey , the voter ’re not on the voter list.’ So this is where Laudner , being a former executive director of the Republican Party who knows the ins and outs of all this stuff , just says ‘ Hey , we ’re just going to arm our people with voter registration forms . We ’re we going to rely on the Republican we to have enough forms . We the Republican Party them there that night and register them we then there ’s our people little problems that could upset our people supporters.’ Laudner , Trump ’s top Iowa official who in we led former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum to a surprise victory in the caucuses , has largely kept the Trump campaign ’s ground game efforts in Iowa a secret . But a little over a week ago Iowa Winterset , Iowa , at the John Wayne birthplace when the Wayne family Iowa Trump for president in the iconic film actor ’s birthplace museum , Trump was asked by a reporter during the subsequent press conference Trump his ground game and brought Laudner on stage with him . a reporter Well I think I feel very good about a reporter ground game , " Trump said . " We have his ground game of people Trump Chuck —   where ’s Chuck ? Come here Chuck . Get over here Chuck . We ’re going to put all Chuck pressure on Chuck . Chuck question We how do we feel about our ground game Chuck Chuck can answer that question , We if he We n’t do good Chuck Chuck you ’re fired ! " Laudner Chuck joining Trump at the podium Chuck added more by noting that he feels " fantastic " about ground game efforts . " We feel Laudner about the ground game and I know we go silent on those things but there ’s nothing about this campaign We ’s like all the rest or any of those in the past , " Laudner said . " We do things different and we reach out to Laudner who normally would We be caught dead in We events . So we feel really good about our chances , we feel really good about We reach and we think We ’re going We have a surprise on We night . We Laudner added that there is a conscientious decision by the Trump organization to Laudner broadcast its ground game efforts . Very Trump like businessman hiding trade secrets from the Trump organization competitors , Trump is purposely not telling the press —   Trump politicians regularly do when they build a successful organization and routinely run to the press to brag the press it —   about his ground game machine the press We do n’t Trump our caucus trainings and we generally do n’t let you folks [ the media We in because we We working and it ’s not about you , it ’s about ground We , " Laudner said then . " We ’ve it just in the last week Laudner caucus trainings . " Trump added then that he thinks his team has Trump " great shot Trump at Trump , but he did Iowa then —   and still has n’t Trump   predicted an outright victory . " I think we have great ground game , " Trump said there . " I think we We going Trump have a great shot at winning Iowa . I hope we We Iowa . " OO . Iowa ( function winning Iowa   ) } We
