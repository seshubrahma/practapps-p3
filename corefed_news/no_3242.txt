Twitter has officially announced three new changes to the platform in Twitter latest effort to combat " abuse and harassment . " [ The changes include extra measures to stop suspended users from creating new accounts , " safer search results , " and the collapsing of " potentially abusive or    Tweets . "   " Making Twitter a safer place is our primary focus , " claimed the company in a blog post update on Tuesday . " our stand for freedom of expression and people being able to see all sides of any topic . That ’s put in jeopardy when abuse and harassment stifle and silence those voices . We wo n’t tolerate it and We ’re launching new efforts to stop it . " " Building on the work We began in November , We ’re continuing to work on ways to give people more control over what people see on Twitter , " people continued . " Last week , We introduced an improvement to reporting abusive Tweets that gives people experiencing targeted harassment more ways to report it . Today , We ’re announcing three changes : stopping the creation of new abusive accounts , bringing forward safer search results , and collapsing potentially abusive or    Tweets . " " Safer search results " will work by removing " sensitive " tweets and tweets from blocked and muted users from your searches on the platform , while their new collapsing system will hide a large quantity of replies on your tweets . Twitter does not explain what qualifies a tweet for being deemed " sensitive , " and while Twitter says " this type of content will be discoverable if you want to find it , " it does n’t say how since " it wo n’t clutter search results any longer . " Twitter has also not yet explained how Twitter will combat the creation of new accounts from suspended users . " In the days and weeks ahead , we will continue to roll out product changes   —    some changes will be visible and some less so   —    and will update you on progress every step of the way , " concluded Twitter in Twitter post . " With every change , we ’ll learn , iterate , and continue to move at this speed until we ’ve made a significant impact that people can feel . " The platform has introduced numerous other attempts to combat " harassment " and " hate speech " over the past few years , including a word filtering tool inspired by the    Twitter alternative Gab . Twitter , who recently donated $ 1 . 6 million to the ACLU , has repeatedly been accused of censoring conservative and libertarian accounts over the past few years , with numerous    users having been permanently suspended from The platform . Breitbart Senior Editor MILO , Pharmaceutical Entrepreneur Martin Shkreli , and rapper Azealia Banks have all been permanently suspended from the The platform while others have been temporarily suspended following political remarks . Despite the sanctioning of    accounts , numerous abusive users have been allowed to stay on Twitter . In July , Twitter refused Twitter sanction an account that sexually harassed and sent violent threats to a female Breitbart News contributor , while rapper Talib Kweli was able to repeatedly call numerous black conservatives " coons , " including Breitbart ’s Jerome Hudson , Sheriff David Clarke , and    activist Maajid Nawaz , without suspension . Threats against the president President Trump been repeatedly allowed on Twitter , with over 12 , 000 tweets calling for the assassination of President Trump having been made since he took office President Trump January 20 .
