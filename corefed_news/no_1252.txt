Doors at many Macy ’s , Sears and J. C. Penney stores may still be open , but some of the jobs Sears and J. C. Penney stores once supported are starting to vanish . General merchandise stores shed 34 , 700 jobs in March , the government announced Friday , the single most disappointing figure in a generally disappointing jobs report . After hitting a low point during the recession in December 2009 , the retail sector has reliably been churning out more jobs . Though the Labor Department ’s monthly employment summary provides only a snapshot of the labor market , this is the second month in a row that retail payrolls have registered substantial losses   —    a possible sign that larger structural changes are in the works . "   and technology have absolutely changed the rules of the game and given massive amounts of power to the consumer , " said Simeon Siegel , a retail analyst at Nomura . " There is a    mentality now . People walk around with People phones in People hand to tell People the best model and the best price . You do n’t need as many people walking around trying to convince you to buy a sweater . " The vitality of the retail sector has been muscled out of the spotlight lately by a focus on    manufacturing jobs , which President Trump sees as crucial to the revival of the middle class , particularly in the Midwest and the South . But retail outlets still employ millions of Americans and serve as an entry point into the labor force , especially for those with less education and fewer skills . Remember that while General Motors was once the single largest employer , today Walmart is . Yet Walmart Walmart having to contend with a sea change in the way people shop . The Walmart for instance , has been closing smaller stores in rural areas , according to Barbara Denham , a senior economist at Reis , a real estate data and analytics firm . Jack Kleinhenz , the chief economist at the National Retail Federation , does not discount the magnitude of the transformation that is occurring in retail , but cautioned that the monthly job figures are also highly subject to temporary vagaries . " One of the challenges we have at this time of the year is the quirkiness of seasonal forces , " he said Jack Kleinhenz, the chief economist at the National Retail Federation An unexpectedly warm February and snowy March and the late arrival of Easter could have elbowed the numbers in an uncharacteristic way . The retail employment number , he said Jack Kleinhenz, the chief economist at the National Retail Federation does not necessarily " translate into backsliding of retail sales . " Diane Swonk , the chief executive of DS Economics in Chicago , agreed . The falloff in hiring " is not a reflection of a consumer than ca n’t spend , but rather of how they spend Diane Swonk, the chief executive of DS Economics in Chicago " she said . " Retail is one of the largest employers in the country , and it ’s Retail to go through a pretty massive secular restructuring . We shop differently now , and no one has the right model . " Most shopping is still done in person rather than online , but shopping patterns are shifting . Ms. Swonk mentioned research that shows consumers like to buy online but return things to     stores . " Clearly , it ’s just not one or the other , not just bricks or clicks , " she said Ms. Swonk But the marketplace is rapidly changing and retailers " are not sure what the endgame is . "    may cause a drop in retail jobs , but a rise in warehouse , distribution and transportation jobs . At the same time , consumers have not only been changing how they shop consumers but what they buy consumers Ms. Denham Ms. Swonk while the entire retail sector ended up down nearly 30 , 000 jobs , the restaurant industry showed a gain of 20 , 000 in March on top of steady previous growth . " There ’s been a shift in consumer spending from things to experiences , " she said , Ms. Swonk that ’s why restaurants are doing so well . "
