Thursday on Fox New Channel ’s " America ’s Election HQ , " Pinal Co. AZ Sheriff Paul Babeu said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is making " illegals and refugees " a priority and " not Americans . "   Pinal Co. AZ Sheriff Paul Babeu said , " I can tell you that Donald Trump was very clear as Donald Trump always has been about a secure border , about this novel concept of enforcing the law for immigration , which is not happening now .   I think there is a clear difference with Donald Trump making this a priority . Not just with illegal immigrants , or the drug cartels , but about ISIS —   about a clear , obvious threat from terrorists coming across this unsecured border . Hillary Clinton is just the opposite . " " You look at Hillary Clinton website and anything Hillary Clinton says , Hillary Clinton whole public statements are about prioritizing not Americans , but illegals , refugees , talking about allowing prioritizing not Americans, but illegals, refugees on a path to citizenship , " Hillary Clinton continued . " Hillary Clinton has literally leap frogged over Barack Obama who never said that , even though we believe that ’s Hillary Clinton intention . Hillary Clinton ’s actually said it . They are on a path to citizenship . No concern about stopping what has been going on for decades now with an unsecured border . We need to secure an unsecured border first and then we We have a reasonable discussion about what we We . "
