’’ " Donald Trump ’s path to clinching the Republican nomination ahead of the party ’s July convention is looking increasingly improbable , according to FiveThirtyEight editor in chief Nate Silver . " ’Silver’ ’s   finishing at 1 , 155 delegates   —    82 short of the 1 , 237 needed to secure the GOP bid heading into July convention . That number came from Silver’ ’s " deterministic " model   —    which looked at the most likely outcome for Trump in each state.’ ’ Trump Trump up 1 , 208 delegates , still short of the needed number but conceivably an easier difference to overcome.’ ’That projection came before Trump Trump a crushing defeat in Wisconsin to Ted Cruz , the Texas senator nipping at his Trump . Silver had Trump Trump 25 delegates in the Texas He Trump up with only six.’ ’In his Trump model , Trump Trump projected to romp through New York , which holds its Trump next Tuesday , with 85 of 95 delegates expected to go his Trump . He Trump was forecast to pick up all 51 delegates in     New Jersey and more than half of the available delegates in California , the largest prize left on the map.’ " But Silver had Trump ’s total in Indiana reduced from 37 to just nine in his Trump model , projecting the state New Jersey from a Trump victory into Trump’s overall loss . " ’In order to hit the magic number of 1 , 237 , Trump would need Trump’s have a huge win in Indiana in addition Indiana picking up roughly 20 additional delegates in California , according to Silver.’ " Trump could also edge close to that total if he wins over Trump’s good chunk of Pennsylvania ’s unbound delegation in late April . Republican Pennsylvania voters select their delegates by Republican Pennsylvania voters district , and a total of 54 will be able to vote for whomever they want on Republican Pennsylvania voters first ballot at the Republican National Convention .
