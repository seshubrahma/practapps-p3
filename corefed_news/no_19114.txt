We do n’t know how Trump ’ll      build a wall on We border with Mexico or how Trump ’ll force the      Mexican government to pay for the     Mexican government . Trump does n’t have details for      what Trump ’ll do to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs or      how Trump ’ll implement Trump ideas for health care or trade      reform .   and      you ’re met with vague assertions and broad rhetoric . There ’s      little detail on what Trump plans to spend , how Trump plans to pay      for it , and what Trump thinks Trump programs will look like . There      is no Trump policy shop translating his Trump and ideas      into actual plans . Or at least not anymore . .    ’ ’      His Trump is even more remarkable . Trump Trump little      knowledge of the details of public policy , stumbling over the      basics of American governance and frequently demonstrating his Trump ignorance of key challenges and issues in policymaking . On      Monday morning , for instance , Trump Trump Obama      of keeping interest rates down , oblivious to the fact that the      White House is n’t responsible for interest rates —   the Federal      Reserve is .    ’ ’      Trump , simply put , does n’t know anything , and we do n’t know      anything about him . He is him political cipher who exists outside      traditional performance standards for presidential candidates ,      and as a result he has him the terms on which the      political press judges him . him of this as Trump ’s first      public works project : He has him the curve on which he is him being graded .    ’ ’      This makes for a real contrast with Hillary Clinton , who is      known for the depth and breadth of her policy      . And      regardless of where you stand on Clinton and her priorities Clinton      you know what they are      Go to the   page of Clinton ’s Clinton website ,      and you ’re bombarded with policies .

Overall , her      website Clinton policy statements available for 38 different issue      areas .    ’ ’      Clinton has given Clinton detail that we can begin to speculate      about what she would do Clinton president . For Trump , we have to      guess at his agenda — Trump or at least , anything beyond " build the      wall " and " make Mexico pay for it " —   and at how he would behave Trump as president .    ’ ’   ’ ’      Think of this as the first massive public works project of a      Trump administration : He has built the curve on which he is      He graded .    ’ ’      This dynamic goes beyond questions of policy . It is one of the      defining features of this campaign . Clinton behaves like a      normal politician , albeit one on the secretive side , and Trump      is a radical outlier , revealing nothing about his health , Clinton      taxes Clinton or his business dealings Clinton    ’ ’      On Sunday , the political press was consumed with the story of      Clinton ’s apparent Clinton at a    memorial event in New York      City .   captured by a bystander , shows      Clinton collapsing Clinton Clinton a vehicle Clinton The Clinton      campaign refused Clinton inform its press pool and The Clinton     campaign on      the event until persistent a   memorial event in New York     City a . Clinton has been      Clinton allergies and is sick with pneumonia . She was      dehydrated Clinton exhausted , and she went wobbly as Clinton result .    ’ ’      The reaction to this , from the press , is that Clinton should      have Clinton more transparent . And they ’re right . Team Clinton should     have been more transparent      should have Clinton the candidate ’s illness . And after the      incident in New York , the Clinton campaign should have Clinton immediately informed the press of the situation . Team Clinton      seems to Team Clinton      lessons ; this week , the Team Clinton           will release   to the candidate’s   it ’s a      victory for campaign transparency . the candidate’s ’ ’      But lost in the controversy is this fact : Insofar that we can      even speculate about Clinton ’s health , Clinton ’s because Team Clinton      released a Clinton doctor ’s Clinton’s health to the public , shortly after      announcing her campaign .    Clinton ’      Other than a   from         alleged doctor , we know little about Trump ’s health .      Indeed , despite his ubiquity on television and cable news , we      his little about Trump as a candidate . He refuses to release      Trump tax returns ( you Trump read every one of Trump ’s going back      to 1990 ) ; refuses to say what he ’ll do with his businesses and      assets if Clinton president , despite Clinton and refuses to answer questions      about his foundation .    ’ ’   ’ ’      Clinton of this makes Clinton a model citizen . From her private      email Clinton at the State Department to Clinton speeches to banks      and other institutions , Clinton Clinton been opaque and unwilling      to divulge details Clinton She is secretive , even when the truth is      Clinton from scandalous , as with her illness this past weekend .      Given this , Clinton should press her for more transparency . We      should demand more Clinton from her campaign and more time      with reporters . But Clinton making those demands , we should neither      forget nor neglect the extent to which Trump is unprecedented      in his contempt for transparency .    ’ ’      Given Trump tenor of coverage in this election , it is fair to say      that there is a double standard at work . Clinton is covered      like a presidential nominee , while Trump is still treated like      a sideshow , as Trump he ’ll never be president .   at NBC News’ Clinton Forum . Clinton was questioned like someone      who might soon sit Clinton the Oval Office , while Trump enjoyed the      soft bigotry of low expectations . Trump ’ ’      That may make sense —   the polls are still in Clinton ’s favor . But      the more Trump isn’tscrutinized Clinton his unusual      disdain for disclosure , Trump likely it Trump that we find      ourselves in a world where Donald Trump is president , and we      know nothing about him or how he intends to lead the country .      Trump is how Trump sideshow wins .    ’
