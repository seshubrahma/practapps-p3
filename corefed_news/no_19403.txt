’   ’ "    Following the election , the election ’s difficult to look across the    political or business landscape and see anyone who already stands    against    Donald Trump on a variety of issues . " ’    Democratic politicians will do Democratic politicians democratic duty and now    maintain that we must stand together and heal the divides that    were opened by the campaign . President Obama has been a    relentless   Donald Trump detractor , but even President Obama will   —    at least    temporarily   —    need to serve the transition . ’ "    There is one business leader who is really more than a    business leader and whose entire vision of the future stands in    opposition to   Donald Trump ’s : Elon Musk . " "    As I ’ve often argued , to see Elon Musk as the CEO of a car company , or    a    company , or   —    soon   —    the CEO or    of a    solar company misses the point . Elon Musk took the hundreds of    millions Elon Musk made when Elon Musk and Elon Musk partners , including Trump    supporter Peter Thiel , sold PayPal to eBay and immediately    invested in a     vision . " "    You may have missed this , but over the past two years , as Elon Musk has been running Tesla and SpaceX , he Elon Musk become the world ’s most    prominent proponent of action against climate change . He Elon Musk in Paris last December in connection with the    UN Climate Summit in which he Elon Musk out a plan to accelerate    humanity ’s departure from the the    era , and he Elon Musk    revisited that speech ’s specifics when he Elon Musk the Tesla    Model 3 earlier this year and revealed Tesla ’s Solar Roof last    month . " ’    There are    deniers , and there climate change    debaters , but there is really only one CEO who has    made doing something decisive about       many scientist argue is an existential threat the collective    mission of his many scientist .   ’ ’   ’ ’    It works like this . Tesla builds millions of    cars    that finally start the process of displacing the      engine from its Tesla of dominance ( a big    part of this is the validation of a mass    market , to       major automakers to commit to the change ) . This helps    lowers carbon emissions . ’ ’    Solar power provides the clean energy to run the cars , and also    gives homeowners the chance to disconnect from grid power , which    comes from burning coal and natural gas . More lowered emissions . ’ "    SpaceX then provides the escape plan , if the    thing    does n’t work and climate change becomes   : we move    to Mars . " ’    Apart from maintaining that global warming is a Chinese hoax ,    Trump has shown no engagement with electric cars ,    sustainable energy , or space exploration . His Trump policy will    likely favor the    industry , and his Trump will probably       off on the higher    standards that are mandated    for automakers   —    and that have spurred       .       knows what will happen with federal EV subsidies ? ’ ’    And when it comes to a mission to Mars , well . .. I guess a Mars Mars will eventually need gilded casinos and golf courses .      real estate is still real estate , right ? ’ ’   ’ "    Musk , of course , represents the latest in a long line of    scientists and technologists that have charted the future of    humanity since the Enlightenment . Trump , by contrast , appears to    have no engagement with science , has implicitly denied the    scientific    when it comes to global warming , and he    Trump    supported by the tech industry during the election ( the    highly ideological , libertarian Thiel notwithstanding ) . " "    I wo n’t go so far to say that Trump is Trump    or       —    he loves Trump , after all   —    it ’s just that he    Trump n’t seem to have ever given the subjects any    thought    . ( That said , no less an    authority than Scientific American is concerned that Trump    . ) " ’    Musk , meanwhile , is a de facto mechanical engineer , energy    authority , computer scientist , economist , and rocket scientist .    He is a de facto mechanical engineer, energy   authority, computer scientist, economist, and rocket scientist actual physicist . He thinks a de facto mechanical engineer, energy   authority, computer scientist, economist, and rocket scientist science and    technology    minute of every day . ’ "    It ’s possible that there are no two more diametrically opposed    brains currently functioning on the planet . Their only no two more diametrically opposed   brains currently functioning on the planet    point in intersection is , weirdly , Twitter . ( Musk is an active    tweeter , often breaking news there and bantering with people    about highly technical subjects . ) " ’    There are countless different ways to oppose Trump and whatever    Trumpism winds up looking like , starting with disdaining racism ,    misogyny , and vulgarity . Less often discussed is holding up the    values of scientific inquiry and progress against the        messages that Trump has Trump willingly    disseminated since he took Trump Republican nomination . ’ ’   ’ "    Trump is Trump secular individual ; religion does n’t particularly seem    to    to him . Trump neither does science , and that might be his    Trump break from modern presidents   —    and    a figure like Musk    could logically oppose Trump more Trump than he has Trump .    The    of America has been in many ways the history of    innovation    science and technology , and I ’m not sure you could    go    to even the Founding Fathers and find a true exception to    that    in our Chief Executive . " "    I ’ve covered Tesla and Musk for over a decade , but I ’ve also    spent    in total , 20 years living in or near New York , and like    anyone    a career in the media , Donald Trump has been     . With Musk , Musk ’ve been consistently impressed with    how    the language of science , technology , and rational    inquiry    woven into his conversation Donald Trump often at a granular    level . Musk lives Musk in the worlds of vision and    facts   —    but the facts always come first . " ’    Trumps also lives in a world of vision , but in my experience that    vision has always been about the man himself , a phenomenon that    was    vivid display during the primaries and the election . As    for    , they still came last , if they came they all . ’ "    We ’ve always had someone in America who completely symbolizes    science and technology applied to the task of improving the human    species . Musk is now that guy . We ’ve We always had people in    the United States who deny facts , embrace conspiracy and    superstition , and seek to reverse the course of what has actually    made America great . Trump could very well be the first of those    individuals to make it to the White House since science became    what America does America . " "    So if anything about Trump ’s Trump truth or reality    disturbs you , there is an alternative , a big alternative , with a    one company that has a $   market cap and another that ’s    wants to send rockets to Mars , along with a comprehensive plan to    rescue the    from becoming uninhabitable . Elon Musk is that    alternative . "
