An    lawyer and editor of a popular legal website is calling on all black jurors across the country to automatically vote to free any black person accused of murdering or committing a crime against a white person despite the evidence . [ Elie Mystal , an editor and contributor to the law blog Above The Law , posted a December 7 article urging all black Americans who end up on juries to engage in " jury nullification " by automatically voting to acquit all blacks accused of crimes , especially that of murder , against white victims and to do so no matter how much evidence is brought to bear against the suspect .   Mystal justified this lawlessness by claiming that "   live in a world where the police can murder us and get away with it . " " There is no justice for black people . And yet violently revolting against the system will get us nowhere , " Mystal added . This , Mystal says , is reason enough to work against the legal system in all areas . Maybe it ’s time for black people to use the same tool white people have been using to defy a system white people do not consent to : jury nullification . White juries regularly refuse to convict or indict cops for murder . White juries refuse to convict vigilantes who murder black children . White juries refuse to convict other white people for property crimes . White juries act like the law is just a guideline and White juries personal morality ( or lack thereof ) should be controlling . " Maybe it ’s time minorities got in the game ? " Mystal added . The legal analyst and lawyer went on to insist that black jurors should refuse to vote to convict any black suspect no matter the crime , including murder , if it is committed against a white person , especially a white man . Seeming to realize that voting to free obviously guilty murderers based on the race of the victim is a horrendous concept , Mystal insisted that it is the only way to " fix " the system . Murder ?    …      what the hell do you think is happening to black people out here ? What the hell do you think we ’re complaining about when your cops shoot us we choke us we Acquit . Do n’t throw " murder " at me like it ’s some kind of moral fault line where the risk of letting one go is too great . Black people ARE BEING MURDERED , and the system is n’t doing a damn thing to hold their Black people accountable . Sorry I ’m not sorry if this protest idea would put the shoe on the other foot for a change . Mystal goes on to call whites who have had a crime committed against them or who have been murdered a " purported ‘ victim’ " and says blacks have no responsibility to help any white person " achieve justice . " Mystal Mystal added that freeing obviously guilty criminals would " gum up the system " and force people to notice the plight of blacks . " White people would lose their White people , that ’s what would happen , " Mystal Mystal in his s**t . " Suddenly , The New York Times would pull reporters off the ‘ understanding Trump voters’ beat and you ’d start seeing stories like ‘ Hmm   …      It Appears Negros Have Some Grievances Too . ’ " " White juries are using jury nullification to protect cops , " Mystal Mystal in conclusion . " But the door swings both ways . It the door time for us to push back . Civil disobedience , when used in a targeted fashion , is a powerful force . " In the end , as far as Elie Mystal is concerned , a few murdered white people who never get justice and their killers allowed to walk free , is a small price to pay to satisfy the Black Lives Matter agenda .
