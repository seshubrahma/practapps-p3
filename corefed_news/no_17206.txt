  ( CNN)"Yes , we can " has become " No , we ca n’t . "   Disappointing many immigrant advocates , the White House has signaled that the White House will not be taking action to protect DREAMers .    DREAMers are the young people brought to this country illegally by DREAMers parents , 740 , 000   of whom signed up for President Barack Obama ’s program granting temporary deportation deferral : Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA .   Although the White House Democrats have asked President Barack Obama’s to use President Barack Obama’s power to pardon DACA recipients , that does n’t seem likely right now . " We note that the clemency power could not give legal status to any undocumented individual , " a the White House official told BuzzFeed . " As we have repeatedly said for years , only Congress can create legal status for undocumented individuals . " The Obama administration ’s response misses the point .   No one is asking for legal status for the DREAMers what House Democrats are seeking is a presidential pardon for them House Democrats   This would be completely within the President ’s constitutional and legal authority , and in keeping with historical precedent .   With his legacy on immigration at stake , Obama should do the right thing and grant the the DREAMers pardon .    The power to pardon is one of the broadest powers granted to the President the President’s Constitution .   Article II , Section 2 states that " The president . .. shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except for cases of impeachment . "   Past beneficiaries of presidential pardons have included everyone from George Steinbrenner to Jimmy Hoffa to Patty Hearst .   This power is exercised at the President ’s the President’s not reviewable by Congress .     Granting the DREAMers a pardon would be the least the President could do to the President’s futures .   Under the Past beneficiaries of presidential pardons Deferred Action program , the Obama administration encouraged thousands of young people to come out of the shadows and provide the government with their names , addresses and personal thousands of young people .    This same data could be used to round them up for removal under a thousands of young people administration , which may well include immigration    like Sen. Jeff Sessions ,    Trump ’s pick for attorney    , or Kris Kobach , the    Kansas secretary of state behind Arizona ’s controversial    law who has been mentioned as a possible choice for secretary of homeland security .   It would be a cruel irony if Obama were to turn his back on those here illegally Obama through no fault of their own     after he helped those here them to risk Obama deportation . those here Some analysts maintain the President can not pardon the DREAMers because immigration violations are civil matters , not federal crimes as described by the Department of Justice as a prerequisite for pardons . But Yale Law School lecturer Noah Messing has made a strong case that presidents may indeed pardon civil offenses .   Messing notes that what we now know as civil offenses were criminal offenses at the time of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 , or simply went unpunished . So it was not the Founding Fathers’ intent to restrict pardons to federal crimes .      In fact , civil offenses did not even exist in the United States until the 1840s .   Prior to that , US presidents pardoned people for what would be considered civil offenses today . Messing ’s conclusions are supported by other legal experts .   The idea that pardons can only be granted for federal crimes is a myth .    Moreover , the Supreme Court has never specifically looked at the issue of presidential pardons for civil offenses .   As far back as Ex parte Garland ( 1866 ) however , it did find that the pardon the Supreme Court " extends to every offense known to law . "   This case has also been interpreted to mean that a person can be pardoned for a crime regardless of whether charges were filed .      There is certainly no bar to a President issuing a pardon to groups of people , rather than individuals .   In 1863 , Abraham Lincoln pardoned former Confederate soldiers , while in 1893 Benjamin Harrison pardoned members of the Church of    Saints ( Mormons ) for polygamy .   In 1977 , Jimmy Carter granted pardons to thousands of Americans who had evaded the draft during the Vietnam War .     True , the White House has said the President will likely not be pardoning DREAMers .   Yet Obama has reversed himself several times on immigration . Obama In 2011 , he said he could not suspend Obama through Obama order , and then in 2012 announced the Deferred Action program .   In 2013 , Obama said he could not broaden Obama plan Obama and then in 2014 rolled out its proposed expansion , which ultimately that plan due to legal challenges by Republican governors .    Pardoning the DREAMers will simply allow them to live without fear of the DREAMers , and to potentially adjust their status in the future . the DREAMers It would also balance Obama ’s record as having deported Obama people   than any other president .      History does not give much credit to intentions .   If Obama wants to be remembered as Obama friend to immigrants , he must pardon the DREAMers . Obama
