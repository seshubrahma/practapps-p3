Democrats the health care law they champion Price ’s stock trades provide them an opening to Democrats the public , and perhaps a handful of Republicans , to oppose his confirmation . his are not yet scheduled but are expected in January . Democrats then will have 48 seats compared to 52 for Republicans , meaning they will need to Democrats at least three Republicans to abandon Price if they are to defeat Republicans .
