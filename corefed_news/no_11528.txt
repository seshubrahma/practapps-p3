" President Obama has been hitting the Second Amendment , " and wants to hit the Second Amendment again with more    Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump said during the January 10 airing of Fox News Sunday . [ President Obama should not be pursuing gun control " through executive order , " Donald Trump said . Rather , President Obama " should get together with the Republicans and the Democrats , and work something out , " Donald Trump said , giving Congress the opportunity to check the President ’s actions by refusing gun control .   President Obama has gone around this Congressional check —   not just on guns , but also " on the border and   …     all over the place , " Donald Trump said . " Does [ President Obama ] even meet with anybody anymore ? All Donald Trump does now is sign executive orders . " " I have a real problem any time you start knocking and taking chunks out of the Second Amendment . " The conversation then turned to Trump ’s support for an armed citizenry , with Trump saying that if even " a couple " of citizens in San Bernardino had had guns , " it would have been a totally different story . " Trump said : In Paris —   the toughest gun laws they say , in the world , or just about —   France , the toughest gun laws in the world —   [ and ] 130 people killed . And people in those rooms in Paris —   when they France, the toughest gun laws in the world —  [and] 130 people killed being shot —   no guns on the good guys’ side —   had there been guns [ in the people ’s hands ] there would have been shooting and [ the gunmen ] would have be gone and it would have been a much more smaller tragedy than it it out to be .
