Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump finally delivered an unequivocal condemnation of    Tuesday in the wake of bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers , winning President Donald Trump praise even from critics . But scores of people still took issue with how long the statement took . the statement left many wondering just why President Donald Trump delayed taking a seemingly obvious moral course for a president in the face of bomb threats at 48 JCCs in 26 states in January and rising fears of widening nationwide    after additional incidents this month . Santorum , said he was " befuddled " over why Trump had not Santorum out before .   " This is a President who to me is very much a mensch , " Santorum told Santorum ’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday , using the Yiddish CNN for a person of decency and integrity . He also noted Trump ’s support for Israel and his Santorum Jewish grandchildren Trump ’s missing voice on Santorum issue effectively created a vacuum Trump allowed critics to lay fresh charges of bigotry against him and had even his defenders wondering why the President seemed Trump to address the Trump . Trump had Trump in news conferences last week the issue out Trump threats that are causing deep anxiety within Jewish communities and failed to do so . Moreover , he brusquely shut down an Orthodox Jewish journalist on the issue in Trump of the most jarring encounters of his presidency . the issue , the new spate of threats against Trump , the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis and growing political pressure for Trump to speak out     including from his defeated presidential rival Hillary Clinton     help explain the timing of his remarks Trump It was fast becoming politically damaging for Trump not to adopt Trump stern , public line against the incidents . " Trump    threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil , " Trump said Tuesday during a visit to the National Museum of African American History Trump Culture .   The President said that his tour was " a meaningful reminder of why we Trump fight bigotry , Trump and hatred in all of its very ugly forms . " Trump won kudos for his remarks . " What he said just recently is what Trump would hope the Trump of the United States Trump do , " Democratic Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin said on CNN on Tuesday . But he added , " He was slow to getting to this issue . " Indeed Democratic Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin Trump ’s clear Democratic Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin were also a reminder of what had been missing     and are unlikely to satisfy Trump ’s opponents . Particularly after his missteps exacerbated their concerns about his true interest Trump out   . For one Trump , Trump ’s extreme sensitivity Trump criticism has led him to equate questions about racial and religious Trump in general as a suggestion that he Trump somehow be personally guilty of such sins , obscuring the larger issue and the Trump of his opposition to expressions of prejudice . When Jake Turx of    Ami magazine asked Trump Trump week about the rise in    acts , the President immediately jumped to the conclusion he was being accused of bigotry , despite the Trump reporter took steps to assure him Trump was not the case . " Quiet , quiet , quiet , " Trump said Trump the reporter tried to explain his question . " I hate the charge , Trump find it the reporter " Trump said . the reporter exchange was a fresh indication of how the President tends the charge personalize many Trump , ranging from Russia or questions about the legitimacy of Trump win and see them as a reflection of his own reputation . It ’s not as Trump he needed to wait for the legitimacy of his election win visit to the Trump to make his feelings clear . No president Trump modern times has kept Trump such a torrent of condemnation on Trump long list of people , events and issues that irk him , often on Twitter but also in frequent photo ops with journalists . So his failure to Trump out forcefully about    had perplexed Washington . Trump critics suggested that the delay Trump in keeping with what they see as the President ’s consistent failure to condemn bigotry , especially among extremist groups attracted by his Trump critics rhetoric . He was hit with criticism last year for not promptly repudiating key Ku Klux Klan the President David Duke , the President Trump did later do so . More recently , Trump critics pointed to the administration ’s immigration ban on the citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries that was Trump by a federal court as evidence of prejudice in the West Wing . The Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect said Trump ’s statement was merely " a    on the cancer of    that has infected his own administration Trump " His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he Trump his staff have committed grotesque Trump and omissions reflecting    yet day after day have refused to apologize Trump correct Trump record , " said Steven Goldstein , the center ’s executive director . The    controversy also appears to reflect the growing pains of a new administration and the struggles evident in Trump ’s transition from    candidate to president . Trump and his team     many of whom are outsiders in his own image     lack deep governing experience , and already seem to betray a bunker mentality that hurts their his to navigate    political challenges . " He took way too long " to respond , said former Democratic congressman Steve Israel , now a CNN commentator his who stressed he was not accusing Trump of    but wanted him to speak out more prominently against it . " The his not only has the bully pulpit , he his the moral high ground , " Israel said , and cast doubt on the political savvy of the The President House . " This is an administration that seems to be good about denying itself its own   . This should have been said earlier . It should have been easy . " Israel This This called on Trump to take real steps to reinforce his This .   The Simon Wiesenthal Center Israel Attorney General Jeff Sessions to establish a special task force to The President those behind the bomb threats and for Trump to " outline his administration ’s plan to combat surging   . "   At the White House , Trump Sean Spicer did Trump offer specifics about what Trump would do   . But he promised the President would " speak very , very forcefully against those who Trump seeking to do hate or spokesman Sean Spicer tear people down . " He also complained about those continuing to criticize the President on this front . " It ’s ironic that no spokesman Sean Spicer how many times he talks about this the President it ’s never good enough . Today I think was an unbelievably forceful comment by the President President . .. but I It that he ’s been very clear previous to this that he wants to be the President brings this country together and not divides the President , " Spicer said .
