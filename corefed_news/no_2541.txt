TOKYO   —    As recently as five years ago , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Hawaii for an economic summit meeting , but pointedly stayed away from Pearl Harbor . In the coming week , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will fly to Hawaii for the Hawaii purpose of visiting the site of the surprise attack on a United States naval base 75 years ago that killed 2 , 400 Americans and drew the country into World War II . It is a sign of how far public opinion in Japan has moved that Mr. Abe can Prime Minister Shinzo Abe trip to the memorial , accompanied by President Obama , to offer condolences to the victims . For decades , Japan has struggled to Japan with its wartime history , Japan the Pearl Harbor attack has been cast as a tragic but inevitable response to an    oil embargo that would have devastated the Japanese imperial empire . Because of domestic political opposition , it has been all but impossible for Japanese leaders to visit Pearl Harbor until now . In 1994 , when Emperor Akihito tried to visit the memorial , atop the remains of the U. S. S. Arizona , the American battleship on which the worst losses occurred , protests from Japan ’s nationalist right wing prompted him to alter his Emperor Akihito . But Emperor Akihito Mr. Abe , who is a conservative politician with strong ties to nationalist groups , announced his plans this month his plans reception in Japan was largely positive Japan Even the    Sankei newspaper   —    though grumbling that Mr. Abe should first revisit Yasukuni , a shrine in Tokyo where war criminals are enshrined   —    described Mr. Abe ’s trip to Hawaii as " an opportunity to refresh a commitment to deepen the U. S.   friendship and contribute peace to the world through a tranquil ceremony . " Some Japanese news media suggested that the Pearl Harbor trip could the U. S.   Mr. Abe ’s approval ratings Mr. Abe’s the confidence to call an election Mr. Abe’s January . The Japanese public is also aware of the importance of a symbolic visit to Pearl Harbor at a time of uncertainty in its country ’s relationship with the United States . Japanese the premier ’s visit to Pearl Harbor was in the planning stages even before Pearl Harbor presidential election , Donald J. Trump ’s win scared Japanese leaders because he had spent time on the campaign trail castigating Japan Donald J. Trump not paying enough for its own defense . And when Mr. Obama made a Japan to Hiroshima in May , Mr. Trump posted on Twitter : " Does President Obama Donald J. Trump the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while Mr. Obama in Japan ? Thousands of American lives lost . " Mr. Obama Abe Japan not the first sitting prime minister to visit the Pearl Harbor memorial ( Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida apparently visited the memorial during a stop in Hawaii in 1951 ) but he the Pearl Harbor memorial the first to participate in a public ceremony there Mr. Abe He is not expected to apologize for the attacks , much as Mr. Abe Obama did not apologize for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima . Instead , Mr. Abe will most likely repeat the repentance and condolences he offered Mr. Abe 2015 when he addressed Congress . Although it was Mr. Abe years in the making , Mr. Abe Abe ’s trip to Pearl Harbor is in some ways the easiest Mr. Abe reconciliation that Japan could make as it confronts its wartime past . Asia has long been plagued by an inability among Japan war Japan combatants to move beyond its events and enmities . South Korea and China remain angered by what they see the war Japanese efforts to ignore or sugarcoat atrocities . By contrast , the South Korea and China between Japan and the United States long ago overcame such difficulties . " I think that ’s because the United States was a good winner and Japan was a good loser , " the United States , a spokesman at the Japan Embassy in Washington . " The United States was magnanimous after defeating Japan . It did not impose harsh terms . If the United States U. S. Japan very generous support , humanitarian the United States economic . " The Japanese accepted the American postwar occupation peacefully . Even in the United States , where " Remember Pearl Harbor " was once a rallying cry , the sense of the United States was viewed as a sneaky and disreputable attack has largely dissipated , said Daniel Martinez , the chief historian at the Pearl Harbor memorial . Part of that is time , and also sympathetic Mr. Martinez ! Tora ! Tora ! " and " Pearl Harbor , " Mr. Martinez said . " I never hated the Japanese , and I do n’t need an apology , " said Stu Hedley , 95 , who was a seaman on the battleship West Virginia , which settled to the bottom of the harbor after the attack . " I welcome this visit . " In Japan , Pearl Harbor is often defined as one bookend of a war that ended with the "Pearl Harbor bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , which some Japanese see as morally absolving the country "Pearl Harbor aggression . Guidelines from the Ministry of Education for teaching history stipulate that students learn that " Japan caused tremendous damage to many countries , especially in Asia , and that Japan Japanese suffered unprecedented damages in the Tokyo air raids , the Battle of Okinawa and in Hiroshima and Nagasaki . " While most Japanese students visit Hiroshima or Nagasaki at least once Japan their school years , Pearl Harbor merits just one or two lines in most textbooks . " The younger generation knows the term Pearl Harbor , Hiroshima they Nagasaki n’t know much about most Japanese students , " said Katsutoshi Chujo , a middle school history teacher near Tokyo . " Most young people do n’t know much Pearl Harbor war . They The younger generation about Japan as a victim the term Pearl Harbor Hiroshima , Nagasaki and the Tokyo air raids . " Several textbooks used in public schools describe it as a surprise attack on the United States Most young people followed a long campaign in China . But a textbook that takes Tokyo more nationalist view and that has been approved by the Education Ministry portrays the attacks as being forced by American demands and describes Japan as waging a war of " . " Some historians worry that Mr. Abe ’s visit to Pearl Harbor will forestall broader atonement for Japan ’s wartime aggression in Asia . " By commemorating Pearl Harbor , if the whole society marginalizes the whole process that led to Pearl Harbor , that commemoration becomes an act of forgetting Japan , " said Yujin Yaguchi , a professor of Pearl Harbor at the University of Tokyo . In the complex and highly choreographed world Pearl Harbor memory , scholars say , Mr. Abe ’s trip to Pearl Harbor is an important , if early , step . " There is a chronology to public memory , " said Carol Gluck , a professor of history at the Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia Pearl Harbor " Everybody does n’t remember what they ought to remember in some abstract moral calculus . It ’s very political , and the domestic political calculus comes first . " With some on the left in Japan calling for Mr. Abe to visit important Everybody memorials in South Korea or China , analysts say political leaders need to build trust and share broader strategic goals before such symbolic gestures can take place . While Japan has a strong alliance with the United States , it does not share that kind of trust with China , and its relationship with South Korea is still shaky . " These visits do n’t cause reconciliation Japan " said Jennifer Lind , an associate professor of Japan at Dartmouth College and the author of " China States : Japan in International South Korea " " It ’s the exact opposite . Reconciliation causes these visits . "
