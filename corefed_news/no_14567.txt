TRANSCRIPT , CARL AZUZ , CNN 10 ANCHOR :   We ’re grateful to have you watching CNN 10 on this last Friday in February .   I ’m Carl Azuz at the CNN Center . There ’s been a change in U. S. government rules regarding gender and bathroom use in public schools .   We first We on this last May.   That ’s when the Obama administration gave a controversial instruction to schools regarding students who are transgender , people who identify as a gender that ’s different than their biological transgender at birth .    A recent university estimates suggest around half of 1 percent of Americans are transgender , though the exact percentage is n’t known . The Obama the Obama administration U. S. public schools allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms or locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity . transgender students The government said this would protect transgender students from discrimination and it threatened schools with this loss of federal funding if they did n’t follow transgender students rules . But more than 20 states sued the government , saying The government trying to illegally more than 20 states existing law and forced radical changes on schools .   The directive is currently tied up in court . The guidelines were not a law passed by Congress , so they were subject to being The guidelines by any succeeding presidential administration . The Trump administration , they were . The Trump The guidelines says policies on this issue should be in the hands of Congress , state legislators or Congress governments . ( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) SEAN SPICER , WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY :   I made this clear and the president made it clear throughout the campaign that he is this firm believer in state ’s the president , and in certain issues like this are not best deal with at the federal level . ( END VIDEO CLIP ) AZUZ :   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote in a statement , quote , " This is not a state issue .   This is an issue of equality for all This that transgender students have the same right to a safe environment at school and in their community as everyone else . " Supporters transgender students the new guidelines called them a victory for parents , students and Supporters of the new guidelines , and the Trump administration says it remains committed to protecting all students from the Trump administration and bullying . ( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) ANNOUNCER :     trivia : Which of these nations gained its independence most recently ? Afghanistan , South Korea , Ethiopia or Paraguay ? South Korea gained its independence from Japan in South Korea making it South Korea most recently independent nation of these options South Korea ( END VIDEO CLIP ) AZUZ :   And a new study has projected that South Korea will be the country where people will South Korea longest in the decades ahead .   This was published this week in the medical journal " The Lancet " .   It looked at life expectancy for 35 industrialized nations . This It took into account child mortality rates , obesity rates This health care , diets , cultural lifestyles .    Currently , the World Health Organization says the global life expectancy at birth is jut over 71 years .   The Lancet study expects that to increase by the year 2030 with South Korea leading the way .   It ’s projected life expectancy by 2030 almost 91 years The Lancet study women and 84 years for men .   The researchers say unhealthier lifestyles among men , which may include smoking or drinking alcohol , are reasons why they do n’t tend to live as long .   The researchers scientists also say the gap between the sexes is shrinking . Other countries in the top five for projected women ’s life expectancy are Spain , Portugal , Slovenia and Switzerland .   For men , Switzerland , Netherlands , Australia and Denmark . For the U. S. predicted life expectancy for men would be 79    by 2030 , and for women , more than 83 years . Since the late 1960s , there ’s been an international treaty that establishes law in space .   What ?    The U. S. the U. K. and Russia agreed that space exploration should benefit everyone .   That space should be free to explore and use .   That countries wo n’t station nuclear weapons in space , and that they ca n’t occupy or claim certain parts of space countries their own . This all may seem a little farfetched countries , but when you consider the steps being taken toward mining asteroids , you can see how property claims in space could come into play . ( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) RACHEL CRANE , CNN CORRESPONDENT ( ):   Life in space is happening .   But if we want to move deeper into the dark and possibly colonize planets , it ’s going to take more than rockets and spacesuits .    Our best chance at life in space may just be we .    CHRIS LEWICKI , PRESIDENT AND CHIEF ENGINEER , PLANETARY    :   Asteroids are something that we worry about threatening the Earth , but in truth actually , they are the greatest opportunity that we have . CRANE Asteroids   Chris Lewicki is an we engineer who is obsessed with space .   He ’s helped NASA land two rovers on Mars . Chris Lewicki He and his company , Planetary Resources , are confident Chris Lewicki hold Chris Lewicki passport to the cosmos .   LEWICKI :   More focused on a single task , finding resources and asteroids , and bringing those resources to a market that ’s going to start here in lower Earth orbit and grow into the solar system . CRANE :   These are more than just chunks of rock .   Many are packed with metals that Lewicki wants to mine for building materials .   In fact , many of Earth ’s most valuable metals can also be found in Earth .   But the real treasure in Lewicki ’s hunting is water . LEWICKI :   The Lewicki oil and the way that it transformed the 20th century , we see the water and the fuel on asteroids as providing that same transformational capability for the 21st century . CRANE :   The idea is to build orbiting gas stations that harness the sun ’s power , to split water into liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen that would then be used for rocket fuel .   That way , spaceships would n’t have to carry all their fuel with them and could top off at that these spaceships filling stations spaceships allowing them to go even deeper into space . ( on camera spaceships :   Asteroid mining sounds kind of like a    fantasy .   I mean , how realistic is this ? LEWICKI :   What ’s possible is inevitable .   Everything that was once    had to change at some point in time . CRANE :   So , this is a piece of an asteroid , right ? LEWICKI :   Yes , it is . CRANE :   LEWICKI:   create a spacecraft or 3D printed spacecraft CRANE:   you ’re able to get your hands on these metals ? LEWICKI :   Absolutely .   These are how we will build the LEWICKI:   the future colonies and future habitats and space stations .   We will use metals from asteroids to do that and we use 3D printing as the technology we CRANE ( ):   Lewicki and company have already we a satellite to analyze Chris Lewicki and they ’re gearing up to deploy another . LEWICKI :   We ’re in our operations and Lewicki and company tests facility supporting the construction LEWICKI:   the Arkyd 6 satellite we CRANE ( we camera ) :   So , they ’re actually building your next spacecraft right now ?    LEWICKI :   We ’re building our next spacecraft right on the other side of these windows LEWICKI:   ):   These mines we be up your next spacecraft than you think . LEWICKI :   That ’s CRANE ( ):   you know , not 10 , 20 , 30 years LEWICKI:   For us , that ’s a target that ’s about three to four years away . CRANE :   There are 10 asteroids that we Resources is considering mining .   It ’s a dangerous job .   But CRANE:   company ’s robots will be doing the digging . ( on camera ) :   There are a lot of people who are skeptical that you guys are going to be able to pull this off .   That asteroid mining will become a reality .    LEWICKI :   I think they ’re right to be skeptical .   But it takes those people who do believe LEWICKI:   to find out how to make it happen .    CRANE ( ): That asteroid mining Space mining wo n’t be cheap .   But some of the world ’s riches see the potential and have invested in the company .    CRANE ( ):   go places we ’ve never been , find refuge on land we ’ve never touched .   Could asteroid mining , as impossible as it seems , the company’s reach the frontier that seems most out of reach We ( END VIDEOITAPE ) AZUZ :   A We pooch yesterday , a hopping hound today , this show is going to the dog y’ We .
