’   ’ "    It ’s official . AT&T will buy Time Warner for $ 107 . 50 per    share , or $ 85 . 4 billion . " ’    AT&T announced the agreement Saturday night , following a string    of reports in recent days that appeared to have accelerated the    talks between the two companies . ’ ’    The move means AT&T will own networks like CNN , HBO , TNT , and    several other media properties . AT&T will likely face a harsh    regulatory process , but there is some precedent . Comcast , another    operator , was allowed to buy NBC Universal in 2013 . ’ ’    On Saturday , Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pledged    to block the acquisition . Sen. Al Franken ( . ) released a    statement to Business Insider saying he’ ’s " skeptical of huge    media mergers because huge   media mergers can lead to higher costs , fewer    choices , and even worse service for consumers . " ’ ’    The companies said in a statement that the deal will allow    AT&T to deliver Time Warner content to any device as viewing    habits shift from traditional linear TV to over the top    web and    services . ’ ’’ ’   AT&T gains loads of valuable properties in the deal , ranging    from " Harry Potter " to " Game of Thrones " to all the super heroes    in the DC comics universe . ’ ’    This is the second mega deal for AT&T in   AT&T past year .    AT&T merged   AT&T DirecTV in 2015 and plans to launch a    streaming TV service later this year . The ultimate goal is to    provide all DirecTV content over the internet without the need    for    satellite dishes by 2020 . ’ "    It ’s    a much different approach than AT&T ’s   AT&T Verizon , which is going after online content instead of TV    content through its purchase of   AT&T and its impending purchase   AT&T    Yahoo . AT&T appears to   AT&T to cash in on traditional TV    content and ad dollars while Verizon wants to go against Google    and Facebook for online ads .
