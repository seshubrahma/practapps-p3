Former CIA director John Brennan testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that Former CIA director John Brennan was not sure if there was any evidence of collusion between the Russian government and Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign . [ Yet Democrats are thrilled by Former CIA director John Brennan testimony , because Former CIA director John Brennan said there were contacts between Russian officials and some " U. S. persons involved in the Donald Trump campaign , " and hence an FBI investigation was warranted .   Note that there is nothing new in what Brennan said . The New York Times reported on January 19   —    in a story timed to appear on Inauguration Day   —    that the intelligence services had " intercepted communications " between several Donald Trump " associates " and Russian officials . ( The same story said there was " no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing . ") And last week , Reuters reported that there were 18 such contacts   —    over seven months , less than three per month . All that Brennan presented was Brennan opinion . And it is not clear what prompted his opinion . Brennan said Brennan convened a group , including the FBI and NSA , to investigate possible Russian attempts to affect the election in late July 2016 . What else happened in late July ? In late late July Donald Trump held a press conference at which he was Donald Trump about Russia . After several minutes , he joked Donald Trump " It ’s just a total deflection , this whole thing with Russia    Russia By the way , they hacked   —    they probably have they 33 , 000   . Russia , if Russia ’re listening , I hope you ’re able to find the 30 , 000    that are missing . " Trump was Donald Trump , but the media inflated his remarks Donald Trump a serious attempt to invite foreign intervention in the election . Some Democrats even accused him of Donald Trump . It is not unreasonable to wonder whether Brennan followed the liberal media down a Russian    where the absence of evidence would not end his suspicions Donald Trump Joel B.
