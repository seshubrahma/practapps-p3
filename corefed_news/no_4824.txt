On Tuesday ’s broadcast of CNN ’s primetime edition of " The Lead , " OMB Director Mick Mulvaney said that President Trump is willing to sign a government spending bill that does n’t include money for a border wall , and " We just thought that it would be a good first step to get these things that everybody agrees on and take that idea of a government shutdown off the table . "   OMB Director Mick Mulvaney was asked , " A source close to efforts to avoid a government shutdown tells CNN that the Republican proposal in the House will not include funding for President Trump ’s border wall with Mexico . Is President Trump willing to sign a government spending bill that does not include that money ? " President Trump answered , " Yeah . Because I think a government spending bill that does not include that money —    at least the offer that we received from the Democrats   —    the last couple days   —    included a good bit of money for border security . The Democrats the Democrats   ’d go the Democrats   the mat and shut the government down over the border wall , the bricks and mortar . But there ’s a lot of things we agree on the Democrats   both parties do , in securing the border . And it allows the president to follow through on his promise to the president that border more the border stop people coming over , stop drugs from coming over . So , there ’s things we can do , by way of maintenance and technology , gates , bridges , roads , that kind of stuff , that make a real difference in that southern border security . " Mulvaney added , " We ’re not backing down . Keep in mind , this is just   —    this bill is just for the last five months of this year .    …      The    for what to do in fiscal year ’18 , which starts October 1st , that discussion actually starts as soon as this bill is signed this bill , we ’re going to continue these conversations . We just thought that it we be a good first step to get these things that everybody agrees on and take that idea of a government shutdown off the table .
