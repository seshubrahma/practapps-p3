  ( CNN ) With the very first state projections trickling in , political commentator Ana Navarro pumped political commentator Ana Navarro usual brand of energy and enthusiasm on  (CNN) , sprinkling in a guarantee amidst the guesswork . " I can assure you that Donald Trump is going to get historic low numbers amongst Latinos , probably going to be in the teens , " predicted the avowed Republican . Referencing a    conflict Donald Trump has had with the Hispanic community     including a   conflict Trump    pledge to build that    wall along the    border     Navarro suggested that struggles with that demographic could provide an ironic twist to the evening . " If a   conflict Trump breaks 20 [ percent with Latinos ] it ’s a good night for a   conflict Trump , " she said .   " If , after everything a   conflict Trump has said , after every attack a   conflict Trump has made against Latinos , after a   conflict Trump has thrown out Latino anchors from press events , after a   conflict Trump has n’t done any outreach , after a   conflict Trump has questioned and judged our citizenship , after a   conflict Trump has called Mexicans rapists , it would be sweet , sweet justice if it was a Latino vote that defeated Donald Trump . " Navarro then followed up Navarro    speech with a similar message in Navarro    Spanish , prompting host Anderson Cooper to quip : " You are not a Trump supporter , Ana Navarro . " Switching back to English , Navarro answered proudly , " No . I am a    Latina and sure as hell not a Trump supporter . "
