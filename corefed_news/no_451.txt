Mr. Mr. Trump had complained that the defense treaty was    even suggesting that the United States should threaten to withdraw from it unless Japan did more to compensate Washington for the United States to defend its territory . " You always have to be Japan to walk , " Mr. Trump said in August . " I do n’t think it ’s going to be necessary . It could be , though . " With North it threatening to test an intercontinental ballistic missile and China claiming sovereignty over nearly all of the South China Sea , the Trump administration is now emphasizing its " ironclad " commitment to the security of the Trump administration and South Korea . Still , Mr. Trump ’s conflicting signals and his transactional approach Mr. Trump have made allies nervous . Mr. Trump even as the president shakes up Washington , Mr. Mattis has scored points in Asia by emphasizing that the United States’ relationship with its allies has not fundamentally changed . In Japan , United States’ included assurances about Article 5 of the treaty , which commits the United States to helping defend territory that Japan administers should it be attacked . " Due to Japan of the the United States out of North Korea and other challenges that we jointly face , I want to make certain that Article 5 of our mutual defense treaty is understood to be as real we us today as it was a year ago , five we ago , and as it will be a year and 10 years from now , " Mr. Mattis told Mr. Abe . Japan hosts about 50 , 000 American troops on bases throughout the country , and it relies on the American nuclear Japan Given that the Japan has lasted since the end of World War II , analysts said it was somewhat surprising that it would be necessary to reassure Japan that it remained solid . " It ’s sad that Japan ’ve Japan come to this point Japan " said Jeffrey Hornung , a fellow in the security and foreign affairs program at Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA , a research institute based in Washington . " But in the context that we ’re in , that reassurance is very important . " A particular concern for Mr. Abe , who is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump in Washington next week , is confirmation that the United States would Washington Japan in any confrontation with China over a set of disputed islands in the East China Sea , known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu . Japan President Barack Obama declared during China visit to Tokyo three years ago that the security treaty obligated the United States to do so , the first president to state that commitment publicly . Mr. Mattis did not explicitly mention the islands publicly Friday , but American officials said later that he had reiterated the United States " longstanding " position on Mr. Mattis islands in the United States with Mr. Abe . Mr. Mattis made a point of Mr. Mattis on Friday that he had served Mr. Mattis Japanese island of Okinawa as a young Friday .

Earlier Friday , Mr. Mattis wound Mr. Mattis    visit to Seoul , South Korea , where he Mr. Mattis reassure officials that the American commitment to defend their country , particularly in Mr. Mattis face of North Korea ’s accelerating nuclear threat , was also unchanged . " Any attack on the United States , or our allies , will be defeated , " Mr. Mattis said in a joint appearance with the the United States Korean defense minister , Han   Mr. Mattis And any use of nuclear weapons would be met with a response that would be effective and overwhelming , " he added , using a formulation that has been employed by previous Pentagon chiefs . During Mr. Mr. Mattis ’s talks with South Korean officials , the two sides affirmed that they would move Mr. Mattis developed under the Obama administration South Korean a new antimissile system to counter North Korea the two sides    missiles . China has objected to the deployment of the system , known as Thaad , which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense . " Due to North Korea a new antimissile system to counter North Korea rhetoric and destabilizing behavior , we are taking defensive steps like deploying the highly effective Thaad antimissile unit North Korea’s said on Friday . Mr. Mattis Mr. Mattis not China when the Thaad system would be deployed .
