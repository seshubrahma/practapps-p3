Biden But of late , they ’re being The rest of the world roughshod over . " But Biden also insisted that the current political climate was just a passing phase . " Tolerance has long been our greatest attribute , " he said . Biden We ’ve had our ugly periods our we ’ve had our moments of our , but the arc of this nation has been towards justice . " Biden has hardly Biden away from the public spotlight since leaving office over three months ago , after having spent eight years as Obama ’s deputy and 36 years as a US senator from Delaware prior to that . And he ’s done Biden in the last 100 days to persuade his supporters that Biden has completely Biden the door to a 2020 presidential run . " I think I could ’ve won , " Biden said last month . " Do I regret not being president ? Yes . " In a visit to his old stomping Biden on Capitol Hill in December , Biden was happy Biden oblige inquiring reporters . " Yeah , I am .

" With Trump ’s approval rating at a historic low for a new president and the first months of his presidency mired Biden controversies , Democrats are determined to take back the White House in 2020 . If there is a desire for a bench filled with younger     Biden ’s name somehow continues to make the rounds . Biden ’s longtime younger    Biden adviser Ted Kaufman said it would be a while before Biden feels the Biden to make any kind of decision about 2020 . " That ’s a long way off .

" Who knows where this presidency ’s going to be after 100 days ? It ’s pretty daunting this presidency predict where we ’ll be 100 CNN from now , let alone a year from now . " In February , Biden and his Biden , Biden , launched the Biden Foundation , which focuses on a range of issues including cancer research . He is splitting Biden time between Biden nation ’s capital , Delaware and Pennsylvania , working with separate institutes bearing his name at Biden University of Pennsylvania and the University of Delaware , " He ’s really Biden frankly just as busy as he was when Biden was in Biden White House , " Kaufman said .

" He said when Biden left office Biden was committed Biden continuing to party build , staying involved in the Democratic party , the Democratic Party that , " the adviser said . But some of Biden ’s most ardent political supporters are holding out hope . Steve Schale , a veteran Democratic strategist based in Florida who was a part of the Draft Biden 2016 effort , believes to this day that Biden could have won if he Biden jumped into the 2016 Biden . " I can make a really compelling argument for why I think after four years of Donald Trump , a guy like Joe Biden will be exactly what Biden wants , " Schale said . " If he wants to do it in a Biden of years     sign me up ! "
