’   ’ ’    Over the past year , the   presidential election has caused a    lot of stress for many Americans , whether it’ ’s    about   on the    border ,   or Donald Trump’ ’s comments about grabbing    women " . "   ’ ’    If you’’re feeling anxious , you’’re not alone . In   by the American Psychological Association    ( APA ) over half of American adults reported that the election is    " a very or somewhat significant source of stress . "   ’ ’    ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    This type of anxiety actually has a name : Election Stress    Disorder .   ’ "    If you ’re experiencing stress leading up to Election Day , here    are Wright ’s recommendations : " "    Take a break from the internet or social media , since your feed    is likely full of election posts . Of course , it ’s good    to stay informed about the candidates , but distracting    yourself from thoughts about the election is a    helpful way to avoid stress . For example , if you normally    read 10 articles about Trump or Hillary per day , Wright suggests    trying to limit your intake to one or two until Tuesday . " "    Seeking out social support is also key , Wright says . If you    remain isolated , you ’re more likely to dwell on worries about the    election , or read more posts on social media . By spending    time with friends and family , you can focus your attention    elsewhere and have conversations about    things . " ’    And , of course , there are other general      activities you can try , such as remembering to take deep    breaths when feeling anxious , taking walks , getting exercise    ( ) making sure you get enough    sleep , and eating healthy .   ’ ’    But the best    stress management strategy ,    Wright adds , is casting your ballot early . ’ ’    When people vote early , " people don’’t feel as compelled    to be informed . people let it go and pay attention to something    else , because they’’ve already made people decision , " they’’ve says . " So    be proactive   —    go vote . " ’
