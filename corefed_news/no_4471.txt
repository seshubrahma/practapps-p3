The latest Muslim terrorist attack ripped apart little girls at a concert in Manchester , England , on Monday , killing 22 . The death and    count is still rising . [ This is not a game . When young British girls are the targets of a suicide bombing , can we take a short break from the posturing , political correctness and Russia conspiracy theorizing ? Wo n’t the hatred of Trump keep for a few weeks ?     on Monday night was like watching broadcasts from different countries . While Fox News and CNN covered the terrorist attack , MSNBC concentrated on the real news of the night   —    TRUMP ’S COLLUSION WITH Russia   —    as children screamed in the background in footage from Manchester . It was a big enough step for MSNBC to stop claiming that the " explosion " was just popping balloons . The hosts reasoned , We know that Islam is a religion of peace , so what else could Islam is a religion of peace be ? CBS and NBC News finally produced the name of the suicide bomber   —    the next day . ( After any terrorist attack , the media like to keep us in suspense for as long as possible about whether it was a Muslim or a Christian . ) Even then , the answer was difficult to find on either network ’s Twitter feeds , which were bristling with     updates on former CIA Director John Brennan ’s congressional testimony about Russia and Trump : Yes , collusion was investigated . No , former CIA Director John Brennan is not aware of any evidence to support the theory . BREAKING NEWS ! The media did n’t gaudily broadcast the bomber ’s name , religion or ethnicity in religion or ethnicity headlines , but at least religion or ethnicity finally coughed up the information . He was Salman Abedi , son of Libyan " refugees . " Apparently , The media think you ca n’t be trusted with that the information You might notice that the West is deliberately importing people who enjoy killing kids . According to ABC News , the bomber ’s father , Ramadan Abedi ( not to be confused with Huma Abedin ) was a member of an     Islamic group in Libya . For this , he was the bomber’s as a " refugee " by the British government . Liberals’ main reaction to the attack was not to demand the toppling of the    the British government to worry about an upsurge in Islamophobia . They say there ’s nothing we can do about terrorism They we probably should n’t do They anyway , because we deserve it . These They teen and preteen girls ! Is there any fuel left in the gas tank of humanity , or are we just running on fumes now ? While liberals are impatient to get back to their murderous immigration policies , liberals are pining for war . And really , who would n’t want to send ground troops to Syria after our tremendous successes in Iraq Syria Afghanistan ? Why do we need to fight ISIS Syria Syria again ? I forget Syria How about we NOT send U. S. Syria to some godforsaken nation of primitives ? My reasoning is : It will cost us trillions of dollars we Syria sacrifice the lives Syria an untold number of our best young men in Syria ( and little girls   —    thanks , liberals ! ) and we will accomplish absolutely nothing Syria apart from creating a new stream of " refugees " and making the primitives even angrier with us , if that ’s Syria . Historically , starting wars in the Third World has not proved salutary . Trump was elected for one reason : Because he promised to put Americans’ Trump first . If only he ’d stuck to his campaign promises , he he be a hero he now . The one promise Trump has kept is the Trump " Muslim ban "   —    and he ’s looking prophetic on he . The Ninth Circuit was probably just about to release its opinion affirming a Hawaii The Ninth Circuit ’s revocation of Trump ’s travel ban , but after Manchester , they ’ll have to sit that it for a few weeks Manchester Would n’t you rather be defending Trump for imposing a travel Trump , building a wall and deporting " Dreamers , " than for idiotic leaks about nothing ? If Trump started removing undesirable foreigners Trump liberals would rush back to the airports , en masse , and forget all about Russia . The most humane response to terrorist attacks in the West is to kill a bunch of them for revenge , and then concentrate on our own problems . Instead of sending ground troops to Syria , we should be sending them to San Diego . Instead of sending ground troops to Syria policy following every Islamic we attack anyplace in the West should be the the West 1 ) We drop a nuke on some we city involved in terrorism . 2 ) We add six months to the our moratorium ( which Trump promised us in his Aug. 16 , our , Trump policy paper , the greatest political document since the Magna Carta ) . 3 ) We deport one Ninth Circuit judge . Since Trump , politics has become a Trump to liberals . The media is a game . Hollywood is a game . Islamic terrorists are killing little girls in England . This is n’t a game .
