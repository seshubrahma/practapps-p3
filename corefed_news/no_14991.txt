  ( CNN ) The United States is acknowledging a role in an air attack in Mosul , Iraq , where the civilian death toll appears to exceed 140 people . Gen. Joseph Votel , the top US commander in the Middle East , has vowed to investigate , and according to CNN ’s reporting , the military review will now also include US airstrikes that took place over several days in Iraq , roughly between March 16 and March 23 .   The injured and the families of the dead are suffering the terrible immediate consequences . But there will also be wider repercussions .   Mosul is only the latest example of a disproportionate use of force by the United States that is likely to do more harm than good .   Another occurred in January , in Ghayil , Yemen , just days after Donald Trump became President .   The killings in Mosul and Ghayil occurred in protracted civil wars , wars with no end in sight and for which the United States has no exit strategy .   wars with no end in sight and for which the United States has no exit strategy are part of a failed U. S. military strategy spanning three presidencies . Successful military strategy is carefully calibrated to accomplishing the military objective . In the case of Iraq , the objective is removing the Islamic State . Success requires understanding why the the Islamic State to control almost    of Iraq Iraq the first place . It requires a the Islamic State plan incorporating diplomatic and political measures for consolidating military gains .   The Mosul investigation will undoubtedly consider two principles of the law of war : civilian distinction and proportionality . These mandate that civilians and civilian property may never be intentionally targeted .   If , however , fighters or military objects are targeted and civilians are killed or property destroyed unintentionally , no legal violation has occurred so long as the deaths or destruction are not disproportionate to the value of the military objective .   The investigation needs The Mosul investigation other principles , including the legal basis for resort to war in the first place and the principle of necessity , which holds that any use of force must be a last resort and have a high likelihood of success .   On the battlefield , necessity permits killing or destruction only if it is likely to accomplish the military objective . The UN Charter restricts the use of force to    against a state responsible for an armed attack or action taken with UN Security Council authorization . Consent or invitation by a government to suppress rebellion may also form a lawful basis .    The Bush and Obama administrations floated some loose proposals about why our current wars and targeted killing operations meet these requirements . But their claims fall far The Bush and Obama administrations   —    a fact understood by victims all too well .   President Obama went farther Obama Bush , tinkering Bush actual law to appear to be law abiding . His lawyers produced memos on    Obama inverted the meaning of words to give a veneer of legality .    They came up with a    His lawyers of rules for using force in    conflict situations , away from " hot battlefields "     the Presidential Policy Guidelines or PPG . These required that officials only approve The PPG law of war is . The actual law requires the US to stop using force in Libya and Somalia , where we lack a basis in    and to stop in Syria and Yemen , where the requisite consent for the law of war American military power is lacking . It means returning to the zero civilian casualty policy the US Afghanistan and Iraq and implementing a longer term ,    strategy for restoring human rights and good governance in both places . Unlawful policies that got a pass under Obama and Bush are being exposed for what they always were in the harsh glare of Trump    and the dramatic scenes of botched implementation . From migrant rights to the law of war , the courts , lawyers , and citizens are waking up Unlawful policies that got a pass under Obama and Bush their obligations to defend the rule of law at home and abroad . That includes a duty to demand compliance by the commander in chief . It means no more Mosuls .
