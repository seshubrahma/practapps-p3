’   ’ ’      On Tuesday morning , Donald Trump named Exxon Mobil CEO Rex      Tillerson as Donald Trump nominee for secretary of state . Five days      before that , the    tapped a   Oklahoma      attorney general to lead the Environmental Protection Agency .      Donald Trump has also reportedly settled on a   Montana congressman to run Donald Trump Interior      Department and a   former Texas      governor to head up Donald Trump Energy Department .    ’ "      It is a dark time for the future of our planet . It ’s tempting      to see the selection of Tillerson —   a man who says publicly that      manmade global warming is indeed a real concern for the      world —   as a bright spot in that darkness . " Can a career oil man      help save our planet ? " . Compared to      his fellow Cabinet appointees , " it ’s possible that Tillerson      would be a moderating voice , " . " Tillerson ’s      position on climate change may be to the left of      Trump ’s , " . All three of those reports couched      their those reports ’    assessments      in relative terms , which is necessary considering that the        is soon to become the .    " ’      In the bleak lineup of       who are about to take      hold of our government , Tillerson has been painted as a      possible , if unlikely , savior . He is not . There is no      reason to be optimistic that Tillerson , a career employee of      the world ’s largest private oil company , will make the incoming      Trump administration any more likely to address greenhouse gas      emissions . None . Zero . Zilch .    ’ ’      The climate case for Tillerson is built on the perception that      the     has softened the oil giant ’s        hostility toward the accepted science that shows      humans’ role in global warming . Notably , Tillerson Tillerson also      voiced support for a federal carbon tax in the United States      and for the Paris climate agreement that was negotiated last      year . " At Exxon Mobil , " he said in a speech earlier this year ,      " we Exxon Mobil the view that the risks of climate change are serious      and warrant thoughtful action . "    ’ ’      Sure , it sounds good —   it it practically a relief amidst the      horror . But it it a mistake to judge Tillerson only by his      words . For one ,   in great detail , his his specific      comments on the topic tend to raise doubt about the science      when there is n’t any . More telling , though , have been his his actions .    ’ ’      In the    that Tillerson Tillerson been chairman and CEO of      Exxon Mobil , the Exxon Mobil funneled roughly $ 7 . 25 million to      federal candidates via its political Exxon Mobil committee ,      according to a . The vast majority of that cash —   more      than $ 6 . 5 million —   went to Republicans , and not just any old      Republicans . Recipients of Exxon checks include such          as : Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe , the      chairman of the powerful Environment and Public Works Committee      who authored a climate change —   denying book titled The      Greatest Hoax and once brought a snowball onto the      Senate floor to try to make his case that the world had not      warmed ; Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker , who against the odds      actually once   James Inhofe during a      climate vote two years ago ; and Texas Rep. Joe Barton , the      former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee , who has      cited a biblical flood as evidence against manmade climate      change ( and once infamously apologized to the chairman of BP      during congressional hearings on the Deepwater Horizon oil      spill ) .    ’ ’   ’ ’      Tillerson may be striking a more    tone         public than his predecessor Tillerson , but the company Tillerson      expenditures suggest it ’s little Tillerson than the political      posturing of a man eager to present his company as Tillerson good      corporate citizen to investors . During each of the six campaign      cycles during which Tillerson has been CEO , Republican      candidates have received roughly $ 9 out of every $ 10 spent by      the    PAC , roughly the same share they had been Republican     candidates under the man Tillerson replaced , Lee Raymond ( who      memorably   the Kyoto      Protocol that was a predecessor to the U. N. climate deal struck      in Paris ) . Total political spending by Exxon ’s PAC , meanwhile ,      has soared under Tillerson ’s watch from less than $ 900 , 000 in      2004 , the last full cycle under Raymond ’s reign , to more than      twice that in each of the past three election cycles . If      Tillerson actually      at odds with the Republicans he will          Tillerson join in the Cabinet , there is no evidence of this in his      financial     Tillerson .    ’ ’      Hillary Clinton ,   was herself no stranger     Hillary Clinton      donations from the     industry . According to the      Center for Responsive Politics , industry employees gave her      campaign     Hillary Clinton during      the last cycle , roughly $ 100 , 000 more than they sent to industry employees      ( but still about a    less than they gave to industry employees Ted      Cruz ) . The Democratic nominee was a particular favorite of      Exxon Mobil employees , too : They gave Clinton The Democratic nominee ( about      $ 80 , 000 total ) than they did to The Democratic nominee other presidential      candidate . That money , however , came from individuals , not the      oil giant ’s wealthy PAC , which has avoided donating directly to      presidential candidates in recent years . Tillerson , however ,      displayed no such restraint . He sent his      check      to   a man who managed      to offer up a multipronged energy proposal on the      stump .    ’ ’      Exxon ’s GOP leanings are , of course , not an accident .      As   the company decides Exxon lawmakers receive donations —   and which do      not —   based specifically on how they vote on      lawmakers that Exxon believes will most Exxon its bottom      line Exxon " We are a    [ PAC ] , " an executive involved      in political strategy told Coll at the time . " Now , when you      apply that litmus , our [ PAC ] is rightly criticized —   that we tend      to give more money to Republicans than to Democrats —   but it is a      result of the approach we take , and not a desired result . " Put      another way , Exxon Mobil does n’t donate to Republicans because      they are Republicans ; Republicans donates to Republicans Exxon Mobil      Republican priorities match their business priorities . Republicans is      no ambiguity in the Republican Party line when it comes to      climate : The   adopted at the 2016 GOP convention , for      instance , states unequivocally that " environmental extremists "      are working to " sustain the illusion of an environmental      crisis . "    ’ ’      Denying climate change directly benefits Exxon ’s business      model .   has shown that      even while Exxon was publicly denying Exxon reality of climate      change in the 1990s , they were factoring the Exxon rates of      Arctic ice into their oil exploration plans Exxon An open Arctic is      profitable for them .    ’ Exxon      It is certainly possible , even likely , that Tillerson      understands the threat climate change poses . His company was      Tillerson      of the first to do extensive research on climate change , as      another . Of course , rather than share this      research with the public , Exxon continued to deny climate      change publicly for decades , because it was more profitable for      them to do so . Again , it seems that Tillerson and Exxon      continuously favor pragmatism and profitability over morality .      That is perhaps acceptable , if despicable , when you are running      a private business . But it is an abhorrent quality for a public      servant .    ’ ’   ’ ’      And what of the carbon tax that Tillerson Tillerson to want so      badly ? As the   has documented , time and time again ,        lawmakers in both the   and the Senate      have actively worked to derail any progress on such a      greenhouse    mechanism , which is seen by many      environmentalists and economists as the best way to put a price      on carbon given its relative simplicity . a price      ’s support Tillerson for such a tax appears even more empty when you remember back      to when he first proposed it : in 2009 , when Democrats      controlled both chambers and the President Obama —   backed         bill had not yet died a slow death in the Senate .      the Senate      backing Tillerson have Tillerson’s potential        event if it had come back in the        when Al Gore was      advocating for it and when Republicans had not        closed their      eyes and ears to Republicans science . Instead , Tillerson could comfort Tillerson himself knowing that Tillerson suggestion had Tillerson chance of overcoming      a GOP filibuster in the GOP anytime in the the Senate      future , no small thanks to those lawmakers his company helped Tillerson put there .    ’ ’      Even more troubling than the money Exxon Mobil continues to Exxon Mobil to political candidates openly promising to stop the      action Tillerson claims to Tillerson , is all the cash the company      continues to send to those groups that traffic in the      disinformation those very same politicians wrongly cite as      evidence for their denial . Under Tillerson , for Tillerson those very same politicians Exxon      Mobil continues to Exxon Mobil groups with      a   about climate science by spreading      misinformation and publishing misleading policy analyses ,      including the likes of the American Legislative Exchange      Council and the American Enterprise Institute . The company      suggested to shareholders   that such      the company      . Clearly , they have not followed suit .    ’ ’      Maybe it the company      preferable that our prospective secretary of state      seems at least able to provide lip service to the idea that      climate change is real . But the actions he has taken as CEO      suggest that , if confirmed next year , he ’s far more likely to      say the right thing about he as secretary , while doing the      wrong one .    ’
