Carr and Gill finished in first and second place , respectively , in votes cast for Cruz Sen. Ted Cruz elected    across the the state that primary ’s March 1 primary " I think this is truly grassroots . That ’s what ’s so interesting about this . When this started talking to Joe Carr , who ’s a Cruz Sen. Ted Cruz , and Senator Mae Beavers , who ’s a Trump delegate , and other Trump and Cruz Trump , we all were kind of having the same thought at the same time , " Gill told Bannon . " There ’s a lot of this vitriol , a lot of bitterness and battle between the Trump folks and the Cruz Sen. Ted Cruz right now . But as we look through the delegate list in Tennessee , we realize that we when we stopped the we income tax in Tennessee [ in Tennessee and 2000 ] when people circled our capital and we their horns , people were " we before [ we ] were we Partiers and now we ’re on we sides of this particular political battle , " Gill noted . " But we ’ve worked we fighting the establishment , fighting both the Democrats and the RINO Republicans for a long time , and it occurred to everybody simultaneously that it makes no it for us to get we the finals , as we ’re in we Madness [ of the NCAA Basketball Tournament ] to be the final two teams , and then have somebody that did n’t even make the Sweet Sixteen come in and try to grab the MVP trophy after the tournament game is over , " Gill said . " I think Trump will get the number of delegates that he needs , Trump Beavers told Bannon . " But we want to make sure that when we go to we convenention there ’s not a brokered convention . " " We do n’t we it taken away when we go to the convenention there’s not a brokered convention whoever has earned the vote . I think it makes a when we go to the convenention there’s not a brokered convention of sense for the Cruz and the Trump people , Trump leaders , to get together and say we ’re not the leaders to let this happen . We ’re not the leaders to let them change the the leaders on us and put the leaders in that has n’t worked for the position , " Beavers told Bannon on Breitbart Radio Saturday , heard on the Patriot Channel 125 of the    Radio Network . As Breitbart News reported previously , Beavers , Gill , and former State Rep. Joe Carr , a Cruz delegate who narrowly lost to incumbent Sen. Lamar Alexander in the 2014 Republican U. S. Senate primary , met on Friday to prepare the agenda for the larger meeting , which will be held before the end of March . " This story has caught fire on Breitbart , and people are talking about it all over , " Bannon noted . " Some people in the Cruz and Trump boats are saying ‘ well you ’re selling out our campaign to the other guy,’ and that ’s the furthest thing from what ’s happening , " Gill added . " We ’re going to keep fighting for Cruz . They Cruz going We keep fighting for Trump . But Trump the end of the day , it ’s going to be one of these two folks who actually get to the convention with the most , if not the right , number of delegates , and then , we ’re not going to let somebody who ’s sat on the sidelines come in and circumvent the process , " Gill added . Gill Senator Beavers confirmed Gill ’s statement Gill Trump and Cruz Trump in Tennessee have worked well together for many years . " Steve Gill [ a Gill ] and I Cruz the state income tax together in Tennessee [ in 1999 and Tennessee ] when he was a radio talk Steve Gill [a Cruz delegate] host here , " Beavers said . " I ’ve known him for a long time Steve Gill [a Cruz delegate] I trust him , " she added Steve Gill [a Cruz delegate] " I ’ve know Joe [ Carr ] for a long time , served in the state legislature with him . I know a Steve Gill [a Cruz delegate] of the other Cruz delegates , " she Cruz . " Knowing she other , knowing what could be ahead at the convention , it was easy for us to get together and talk and maybe come up with a plan to fight the establishment , " Beavers added . " We think this [ story us is going to spread like wild fire , " Bannon said . " We think the folks in us have shown tremendous leadership . These people have worked together the folks in Tennessee long time . This is not their first rodeo , " Bannon the folks in Tennessee . " It Bannon a good thing for what we call the Cruzbots and the Trumpbots to be fighting it out right now . There ’s still a lot of fight left . There should be a lot of fight . Even some hard words are fine , " Bannon added . " That Bannon all get worked out in the process , " Bannon added . " These Bannon   …     State Senator Mae Beavers , a Trump delegate , and Steve Gill and Joe Carr , two of the 16 Cruz delegates , these are really great people . These are the kind of people these founders had in mind when they were talking about our representative these , " Breitbart these correspondent Michael P. Leahy , who broke the story of the    delegate alliance in Tennessee on Friday , told Bannon on the same program . " It ’s very important to point the same program that Cruz and Trump delegates here in Tennesse know , like , and respect each other , " Leahy added . " I have great confidence in the wisdom and judgment of these delegates here in Tennessee , " he said . Tennessee if this Leahy of    delegate alliance is likely to spread to other states , Leahy answered in the affirmative . Leahy I ’ve already talked to delegates in other states   …     and I ’m not ready to break the full story yet   …     this is going on in Alabama as well , " he said . " It ’s Leahy just Alabama . this ’ve seen Alabama Alabama Texas and Missouri and Nevada people [ delegates ] are doing the same thing , " Leahy added . Leahy pointed out that efforts by Washington Leahy , such as the Weekly Standard ’s Bill Kristol , to create a brokered convention are unlikely to be effective in the end , because Kristol and others like him lack the Bill Kristol authority to vote Bill Kristol the convention . " Bill Kristol , a brokered convention way , Bill Kristol have a vote at the convention . He may not realize that . a brokered convention Bill Kristol n’t matter . It ’s the Bill Kristol that matter , " Leahy added . " These [ brokered convention proponent ] guys are soft , the Bill Kristols in Washington , the David Brooks in New York . They ’re soft . They ’ve never had any battles These [brokered convention proponent] guys are soft, the Bill Kristols in Washington, the David Brooks in New York They ’ve been These [brokered convention proponent] guys are soft, the Bill Kristols in Washington, the David Brooks in New York . All they do is sit These [brokered convention proponent] guys are soft, the Bill Kristols in Washington, the David Brooks in New York pontificate .
