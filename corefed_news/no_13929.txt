  ( CNN )   Donald Trump has not minced words on the South China Sea . In the past few months , Donald Trump ’s    Beijing in tweets and speeches for   Beijing " brazen "    activities and the construction of a " massive military complex . "   Donald Trump ’s also vowed to use Washington ’s economic leverage over   Beijing as a way to push back     a tactic that , if it ’s used , would open a brand new front in    competition , setting the scene for a possible Chinese economic retaliation in kind . Trump ’s pick for secretary of state Rex Tillerson , unexpectedly , has gone even further . During Trump Senate confirmation hearings this week , Trump boldly declared that China ’s militarization of artificial islets in the South China Sea was " akin to Russia ’s taking Crimea " from Ukraine     a comparison that will ruffle feathers in Beijing . Echoing the views of many Asia analysts in Trump ’s team and across the political spectrum in Washington , Tillerson criticized President Barack Obama ’s South China Sea policy for being inadequate     implying that periodic naval patrols were not a sufficiently muscular response to stop China from continually " pushing the envelope . " But his most controversial remarks concerned what America ’s South China Sea goals should be going forward . Beyond convincing Beijing to stop its       which the Beijing administration has tried but been unable to do     Tillerson said : " We ’re going to have to send China a clear signal China first , the    stops , and second , your access to those islands also not going to be allowed . " No one in Washington has seriously entertained this option . Blocking Chinese naval vessels from accessing South China Sea reefs would almost certainly trigger a    clash . More to the point : as many of the reefs are effectively South China Sea reefs of international waters , preventing Chinese ships from sailing to or near them would undermine the very Chinese ships of navigation rules that the US has been trying to uphold . While we should n’t read too much into this aspect of Tillerson ’s remarks     after all , people make mistakes during    grillings by Senate committees , especially when they ’re new to the Senate committees     the overall tone of his testimony was tough on Tillerson . If Obama ’s team was at times too cautious in taking China to task , Tillerson China blunt talk of China ’s " extremely worrisome China " illegal " actions will bring a sharpness to State Department policy that has n’t previously been present .        Counterproductive on North Korea ? Trump and Tillerson have also harshly criticized Beijing for its failure to help China US Trump and Tillerson United Nations sanctions on North Korea     a hawkish approach North Korea ultimately backfire . Although the    began by tweeting about his disappointment earlier this month , Tillerson , in his hearing , turned up the heat his In unusually frank terms , he stated Washington can no longer accept his ’s " empty promises " on North Korea and should consider putting " North Korea " on Chinese entities that are violating sanctions in order to " compel " Beijing to finally comply . They are correct Beijing should do more to enforce UN Security Beijing sanctions that seek to place pressure on Kim Jong Un ’s regime for its nuclear and ballistic missile tests . Despite North Korea to two rounds of ostensibly tough sanctions in 2016 , China has consistently found ways to avoid truly enforcing these measures     such as not sufficiently cracking down on the vast number of small Chinese companies that import North Korean coal in excess of the UN ’s restrictions . But publicly deriding China for its failure to fully comply with China only China Beijing onto the defensive . Chinese officials have China rejected Trump ’s accusations and talked up their own efforts to build stability on the Chinese officials Peninsula , and will rile at Tillerson ’s latest rebuke . The net effect will be an acrimonious bilateral context in which    coordination on North Korea , or quiet pressure on Beijing , will be more difficult . As China    solution to restraining North Korea ’s nuclear ambitions will require the active participation of China , creating a public rift on this issue is counterproductive . Trump ’s foreign policy team should instead continue to place     pressure on China over poor sanctions enforcement , using private China avenues that wo n’t cause Beijing to clam up on cooperation . A China unstable    relationship , While there is a need for firmer American action in the South China Sea and on North Korea , the Trump administration is shaping up to have a hardline China policy across the board . Since winning China election , Trump has continued to announce that China is the Trump administration US jobs , manipulating its China , and regularly hacking US institutions China He and his team have stoked uncertainty over the Trump administration future the Trump administration    relations     a core concern for Beijing     and talked up a larger US military footprint in the    all while criticizing Chinese inaction on North Korea and its maritime assertiveness in Asian waters . This North Korea a mistake . Getting tough on China on everything at once is n’t going to induce Beijing to cooperate or make difficult concessions . Beijing purely muscular approach , if this comes to pass , will make Beijing a more truculent partner for Washington across Beijing board . The consequences will be negative for    relations globally     making it harder for the two powers to work   relations on issues of mutual interest , such as crisis management and environmental protection , while deepening friction in major areas of disagreement , like Asia ’s future strategic order . Instead , Tillerson and the rest of Trump ’s foreign policy team should prioritize areas where a tougher approach to China is warranted     such as in the South China Sea     and concentrate their efforts to affect changes there . This foreign policy team , at times , require strong public statements and US actions , but should be coupled with private diplomatic pressure that ’s not tweeted in 140 characters or less . Less important challenges in    relations will have to be sidelined for the short term or managed quietly and slowly . No major power relationship can endure hostility on all fronts at once without slipping into a Cold    state . At this very early point in Trump ’s incoming presidency , it seems unlikely his administration will choose heed these calls for Trump . But the reality of negotiating compromises and deals with a major power competitor may well force Trump ’s team to pick their battles carefully Trump’s to get things done .
