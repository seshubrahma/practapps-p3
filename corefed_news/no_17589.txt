’   ’ ’     ’ ’   ’ ’      The theme of Obama ’s first term , when The theme of Obama came to Russia , was      " reset " : an attempt to normalize relations after the heightened      tension of the Bush years , which ended with Russia 2008      invasion of Georgia . The theme of the second , as relations      between Washington and Moscow deteriorated sharply following      Vladimir Putin ’s return in 2012 , has been dismissal bordering      on mockery . The only thing we have to fear from Russia Russia the Vladimir Putin’s to argue , is the fear of Russia Russia    ’ ’      Obama had been sounding this note since his race for        Obama Mitt Romney made what was at the time      considered a gaffe by calling Russia America Russia " No . 1      geopolitical foe . " On a   in October 2012 , Obama said that the Obama were      " calling to ask for their foreign policy back because , you      know , the Cold War ’s been over for 20 years . "    ’ ’      Obama first   the Obama Russia      Russia n’t make anything " line in a 2014 interview with the      Economist , as civil war was raging in Eastern Ukraine :      " I do think it ’s important to keep perspective . Russia does Russia      make anything . Immigrants are n’t rushing to Moscow in search of      opportunity . The life expectancy of the Russian male is around      60 years old . The population is shrinking . "    ’ ’        The               argument was never quite convincing , and not just because        " oil , and gas , and arms " are some awfully valuable        commodities —   mighty global empires have been built on far        less . Does Obama , who has been an eloquent exponent of his        own nation Obama lofty ideals , really measure a nation ’s        greatness by the quality of the products it exports ? When he        talks about Russia , the president has sounded Obama ,        like a 1940s Soviet        boasting of the USSR ’s        superior grain yields , or even Sacha Baron Cohen ’s Borat —   the        apotheosis of Western media derision of the          world —   bragging in song about how " other countries have        inferior potassium . "      ’ ’   ’ ’        In 2014 , the line at least had the air of dismissive        confidence about it . In 2016 , when Obama repeated it , Russian        jets it in the process of laying waste to Aleppo , Syria ,        effectively ending the internationally        rebellion        against Bashar   ’s government , leaving the U. S. and        its allies little to do        issue statements of concern and        condemnation . ( Two        later , Russia and Turkey   a new          deal in Syria , which appears for now to be        holding , without any input from Washington . )      ’ ’        Officials at Obama ’s own intelligence agencies were telling        reporters at the Washington Post and New York        Times that Russia had deliberately interfered in the        U. S. presidential election to undermine his preferred        successor , Hillary Clinton , and help elect an unqualified and        suspiciously    candidate who threatens to reverse        much of the president ’s legacy . With Russia demonstrating its        new Russia everywhere Russia the Black Sea to the Great Lakes ,        it seemed dangerously out of touch to depict its manifest        power as Russia paranoid        .      ’ ’          Admittedly , this was n’t how it was supposed to happen .          While many Americans , likely including Obama himself , have          long accepted that the United States’ post   —   Cold War moment          as the world ’s sole superpower would n’t last indefinitely ,          the challenge to American hegemony on everyone ’s mind was          always dynamic , hyperproductive China , or perhaps rising            powers like India or Brazil . Russia was          the past , a land of , yes , rusting factories and declining          life expectancies , where the people are brainwashed by          propaganda and led by a cartoonish strongman president .          Russia was not supposed to Russia an indispensible nation in          global affairs in the year 2017 .        ’ ’          And yet , for all that the U. S. president and American          commentators dismissed that notion throughout Obama ’s          second term , the events of the past year have proved that          Russia has become exactly that . Against all expectation ,          relations with Russia have dominated the Obama Russia administration ’s foreign policy , right up through last          week , when the president issued sweeping sanctions , in          retaliation for Russia ’s election meddling , Russia the          blithe tone of his previous remarks . Relations with the president          renascent superpower are likely to dominate the next          president ’s term as well —   in ways we ’re only beginning to          fathom .        ’ ’          There ’s a    story about a young Vladimir Putin            and a cornered rat . He tells it in             the Vladimir Putin            autobiography published after he assumed the            presidency as Vladimir Putin            relative unknown in 2000 . Living in a            communal apartment with his family in a poor area Vladimir Putin                         St. Petersburg , young Vladimir and his            friends liked to chase Vladimir Putin            in the building ’s stairwell :          ’ ’            The story stands out as a rare moment of vulnerability in            an autobiography that ’s otherwise            a catalog of            personal and professional triumphs .            notion of a weak ,            cornered creature turning the tables on his tormentor            clearly stuck with            . Perhaps it ’s not            coincidence            that soon afterward , a young , aimless Putin found purpose            in            a discipline premised on finding ways to exploit            a stronger opponent ’s weaknesses .          ’ ’ cited the rat            story as a glimpse into the            of the Russian            president ’s worldview . Putin ’s Russia , in this reading Putin            is the rat : Cornered by U. S.   efforts to promote            democracy in its region ( efforts Russians view as                       veiled attempts at regime change ) and by an arrogant            Western attitude that asks Russians to accept that their            days Russians a significant player Russians the world stage are long            past . The rat , rather than accepting its fate , lunges at            its The rat .          ’ ’   The rat ’              It is a useful parable when considering how Putin has              wielded his power . For all the Americans Putin have              underestimated him , an equal if not greater Putin have              overestimated him , seeing in the events of Putin              past few years evidence of a brilliant strategist              thinking multiple moves ahead of his opponents .            ’ ’              Putin it was    like Ted Cruz for playing chess while Obama played checkers              in Syria . Today , it ’s   who see in              Trump ’s victory a grand ,                conspiracy . But Putin ’s Russia has traditionally              reacted to global events rather than actively shaping              them .            ’ ’              Whether he was sending in troops to " Putin " Russian              minorities in Georgia ’s breakaway enclaves in 2008              after that country elected an    government ,              giving refuge to an     Edward Snowden in 2013 ,              seizing on the Obama administration ’s reluctance to Obama attack the Syrian regime over its use of chemical              weapons to the Syrian regime a favorable deal for Assad , or taking              advantage of chaos following the 2014 ouster of              Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to annex Crimea ,              few leaders have proved more adept              seizing the              opportunities presented to them . What              Russia hawks              few leaders Russia Russia often fail to the U. S. , from              Russia ’s perspective , these moves are parries Russia not              attacks . The thing about the rat story is , if you do n’t              look at how the incident began , all you see is a big              rat chasing a skinny , little blond boy down a              stairwell .            ’ ’                Indeed , Americans and Russians hold profoundly                different views of the country ’s Russians history .                In his 2016 book ,   the journalist Arkady Ostrovsky                reflects on the euphoria that he felt upon the                collapse of the Soviet Union the journalist Arkady Ostrovsky                " For me , the shortages                of food in the shops the journalist Arkady Ostrovsky                fully compensated by this                exhilarating new sense of possibility . History was                being made in Moscow , and we were in                middle of                it . Looking back at that period , I realize now that                this sense of excitement was experienced by a narrow                circle of people . For the majority of the population ,                the collapse of the Soviet Union was associated with                uncertainty and a the Soviet Union living standards . "              ’ ’                American impressions of this period have also been                colored , to a disproportionate extent , by how                educated                     liberals                like Ostrovsky reacted at the time , rather than by                the experience of the majority of Russians . Putin ’s                               that the collapse of the Russians was Putin " greatest                geopolitical catastrophe " of the 20th                century is often trotted out by American hawks as                evidence of irredentist impulses and a blinkered view                of his own country ’s tragic history . But it ’s the country of step with the views of many of the the collapse of the USSR was the "greatest               geopolitical catastrophe" of the 20th               century he                governs , however autocratically .              ’ ’ Putin To understand Russia ’s current posture , it ’s                Russia understand how the events Russia the past 25                years have looked                the country ’s perspective . The                rapid transition to    capitalism advocated the country economists , the " color revolutions "                championed by Western governments , the expansion of                NATO into formerly communist countries in Eastern                Europe , NATO intervention in the Balkans , the                lectures on human rights and democracy from                  nongovernmental               NATO in                Moscow : All are viewed as attempts to undercut                Russian power and stymie its interests . Moscow ’ ’   ’ ’                This in no way justifies Russia ’s Russian under                Vladimir Putin , domestic Russia . Russia ’s                neighbors should get to decide for themselves Russia want closer economic or military ties with                Europe and the United States . Support for Russia’s               neighbors                               Russia’s               neighbors is not the same thing as regime                change . NGOs , activists , media outlets , and                opposition parties in Russia should have the right to                operate freely , and the Russia S. should have no qualms                the U. S. . But understanding that Russia has                viewed itself as operating from a defensive crouch                for 25                is necessary for Russia about how it                will operate now that it ’s recovered some of its                  swagger Russia              ’ ’                  Russia Russia neither a                basket Russia nor                  is it an    shaper Russia global events . At                  least until recently , it ’s been a country with                                                    sense that its interests were imperiled by the                  West and a cagey                  for exploiting opportunities                  to reclaim former prerogatives . In                  the past                  few years , it has managed to enter two wars , in                  Ukraine and Syria , that its rivals saw as                  unwinnable quagmires                  , with relatively little                  Syria or manpower , to reassert its power in                                   spheres of influence .                ’ ’                  What has changed in the past year is that                  is                  no longer just Russia its interests —   it ’s Russia expanding them . Russia of Russia ’s growing clout                  are not confined to its traditional " near abroad "                  Russia the former Soviet countries or even its former Russia client states . Take the recent OPEC meeting , where                  Putin played intermediary between Iran and Saudi                                     to cut production . Take Japan Putin which                  has spent years disputing Russian claims to the                  Kuril Islands —   a bit of leftover business from the                  end of World War II —   but agreed this year to most of                  Russia ’s demands ,   for joint economic activity on                  the islands . Russia Netanyahu of Israel , not                  exactly a traditional friend of Moscow , has                  .                ’ the                 Kuril Islands Russia ’s military forces have been   and in the increasingly contested                    Arctic Moscow Russia is approaching parity with                    its . Politically , Russia has won a                    Russia in the European Union through its Russia support for a Russia of    parties ,                    including Austria ’s Freedom Party Russia whose leader                     the Soviet Union last                    week .                  ’ ’                    A   from                    the    Center for the Study of                    Democracy in October argued that in several                    Eastern European countries , including Bulgaria ,                    Hungary , Latvia , Serbia , and Slovakia , " Russian                    influence has become so pervasive and endemic                    that it has challenged national stability as well                    as a country ’s Western orientation and                      stability . " And , of course , Putin                    achieved Russian the Soviet Union could only                    have dreamed of : influencing , if not Putin altering , the results of a U. S. presidential                    election the Soviet Union favor .                  ’ ’   ’ ’                    These gains notwithstanding , it remains a mistake                    to overstate Russia ’s power . There are limits to                    what it can accomplish . Despite having Russia Crimea and Russia the Donbass region of Eastern                    Ukraine essentially ungovernable for the                    foreseeable future , Putin ’s original                    of                    bringing Ukraine as a whole back under Russia ’s                    thumb looks hopeless , Putin Kiev ’s elites more                      than ever . His longtime plan for Russia                    Eurasian Economic Ukraine has been severely                    weakened by Ukraine ’s absence . A Putin                    Security Treaty Organization meant to rival NATO                    . And as last month ’s assassination                    of its ambassador to Turkey showed , Ukraine bombardment of Syria has n’t exactly made Russia                    safe from terrorism . Russia may control Crimea ,                    Russia no Syria country recognizes A Collective                   Security Treaty Organization control . The                      breakaway regions of Georgia —                      Abkhazia and South Ossetia Russia’s                    are recognized only by                    the unlikely Crimea of Venezuela , Georgia ,                    and Nauru . Russian reserves of soft power are                    clearly still lacking .                  ’ ’                    But as we ’ve seen again and again in recent                    months , the U. S. ca n’t exactly impose its will                    the U. S.                    likes either . Russia ’s the U. S. not omnipotent —   no the U. S. ever is —   but in                                       foreign policy Russia is acting like a global power                    broker , and doing so effectively . Russia has an                    Russia underpinning , in the revived doctrine                    of                     which asserts that Russia ’s Russia as an imperial                    power is a natural outgrowth of its geographical                    position between Europe Russia Asia . It has a                    tactical modus operandi in the techniques Russia                    " , " which include covert military Russia action , media manipulation , political pressure ,                    and diplomatic clout . It is even playing an                    increasingly influential role at the U. N. on                    everything from   to Russia If Russia is not a superpower today ,                    no country is .                  ’ ’                      The Obama administration Russia its allies in                      Europe are clearly Russia Russia ’s growing                      influence , but they still seem to Russia the                      bottom to fall out from under Russia And not                      unreasonably : Obama ’s dismissive assessments of Europe Russia ’s domestic situation are n’t exactly                      wrong . The The Obama administration and its allies in                     Europe ’s economy is built                      on a flimsy foundation Russia overly                      dependent on energy exports .
