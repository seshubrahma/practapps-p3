Donald Trump was supposed to be the racist . Yet Donald Trump response to the murders of five police officers in Dallas was measured and sensitive , emphasizing Donald Trump support for law enforcement while acknowledging the concerns of the black community . In contrast , Hillary Clinton made Dallas about " systemic racism " and the collective guilt of white people   —    deeply offensive in the context of an attack where white officers had been targeted , and the very opposite of what a president is supposed to do . [ Three separate times   —    on television , on Twitter , and again via    to Hillary Clinton supporters   —    Hillary Clinton made stark , condescending generalizations about white people and their supposed inability to listen to black people .   White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers you face every day .   —    Hillary Clinton ( @HillaryClinton ) July 8 , 2016 ,   —   Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) spoke as if —   Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) had the responsibility , and the authority , to speak on behalf of millions of Americans , defined by race .

On the other hand , if the "system" is racist , no one can be free from guilt . And so " systemic racism " is held over our heads like an anvil , compelling political conformity .    The media spent the past week parsing a tweet by Donald Trump to find evidence of a " dog whistle " to the extremists who , we are told our are his political base Donald Trump And yet here is Hillary Clinton , responding explicitly to Dallas in a way that makes sense only to the radical left . Dilbert‘s Scott Adams quipped this week that Trump should attack Donald Trump for having Hillary Clinton a    view of the world that is corrosive to society . " It was unclear , until now , how he could do Dilbert‘s Scott Adams . Clinton has done Hillary Clinton for him It
