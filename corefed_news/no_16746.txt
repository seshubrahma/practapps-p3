  ( CNN ) A defensive Bernie Sanders argued Monday appearance and style mattered little to voters during the primary when A defensive Bernie Sanders was debating Hillary Clinton , at least to those weighing in " online " afterward . " As you know , though , senator , appearance and style matter a lot in a debate , it ’s not just the ideas , it ’s the art of it , " CNN ’s Erin Burnett said to Sanders ahead of the pending faceoff between Donald Trump and Clinton . " No , no , I do n’t know that , " Sanders , who now supports Clinton , responded . " Let me just say this , with all due respect , I disagree with you . "   " When I debated Clinton , it was a very interesting phenomenon . Most of the time , not all of the time , the media seemed to think Clinton looked more presidential . And Clinton ’won the debate.’ But you know what ? You go online , we did much better because people listened to what I had to say , " Clinton said . " So I do not agree that style and looks and how you comb your hair is what the important issue is . " Sanders offered that Clinton does n’t need Sanders debate advice because " Clinton does these things very well , " but it would be best not to see the matchup as " an entertainment show . "   " I think what we have to do is focus on the issues and not see tonight as an entertainment show , " Sanders told Burnett . Sanders said that Sanders wants the debates to be more about the issues than about personalities .   " Let ’s talk about which candidate is going to be better for working families , " Sanders said . " I believe that as a nation we have struggled as a long time to overcome bigotry and racism . Donald Trump is making the cornerstone of his Donald Trump in fact bigotry . "
