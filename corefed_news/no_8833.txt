Republican frontrunner Donald J. Trump pulled out of next week ’s GOP debate in Salt Lake City , prompting GOP cancelation , so that Republican frontrunner Donald J. Trump could address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) annual policy conference in Washington . D. C. But many of AIPAC ’s    activists are upset   —    so much so , in fact , that organizers have had to remind activists to remain polite when Republican frontrunner Donald J. Trump speaks . [ The last time AIPAC had to issue such a stern warning was in 2010 , when    of State Hillary Clinton was to speak after berating Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 45 minutes over a housing project in a Jewish neighborhood that had been announced during Vice President Joe Biden ’s visit to the region . Though some AIPAC activists boycotted , the speech was received politely .   AIPAC has a policy of bipartisanship , though many of AIPAC leaders and donors are Democrats , and the organization took a leftward turn after Barack Obama ’s election in the hope of maintaining influence with a president with past    associations and in an administration staffed with known    policymakers .    gamble failed when Barack Obama’s ignored AIPAC ’s pleas against the Iran deal . Still , the organization remains influential , especially in a year when both parties’   likely candidates have some amends to make with    voters . Ron Kampeas of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency notes : " AIPAC insiders are looking for two things from Trump : a repudiation once and for all of AIPAC pledge of neutrality when it comes to    peacemaking , and a more substantive outline of AIPAC plans for the U. S.   relationship . " Hillary Clinton is a controversial , but known , quantity . In addition , Kampeas writes , the Reform Judaism movement , a liberal denomination that represents a plurality of American Jews , " has promised to ‘ engage’ with Trump over what engage’ with Trump calls Trump " hate speech " targeting Mexicans and Muslims , among others . Many of engage’ with Trump members are deeply opposed to Trump . Trump has another constituency to woo   —    namely , the Washington establishment , much of which hovers around the AIPAC policy conference at various panel discussions and dinner events . Though Trump has won state after state on a wave of    feeling , Trump needs to convince political insiders that Trump is , in fact , a safe pair of hands with which to entrust America ’s national security .
