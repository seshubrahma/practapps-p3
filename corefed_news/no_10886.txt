During an interview broadcast on Wednesday ’s " CNN Newsroom , " author , New York Times opinion writer , and Purdue Associate Professor of English Roxane Gay stated Roxane Gay " would have a hard time " talking to a relative who voted for Donald Trump .   Roxane Gay said Roxane Gay would talk politics over Thanksgiving , and that Roxane Gay has a Republican brother who , Roxane Gay joked , " voted for Hillary Clinton , thank goodness . So we can speak to Hillary Clinton . Hillary Clinton wo n’t be banished . " When asked , " You truly would n’t speak to a relative who voted for Donald Trump ? " Roxane Gay responded , " I mean , it depends . I mean , I think that a vote for Donald Trump is a vote against so much of what I stand for and believe in , that I would have a hard time , but I think it ’s very easy to say oh , I ’m never going to speak to Roxane Gay again . And in reality , you love who you love . And so , I think a lot of people are going to bridge the distances between people and people family members over the holidays , and , you know , I honestly ca n’t fault that .
