’   ’ "    Earlier this week , Google   when one of Google   top results for " final    election count " was fake news . The top result in Google Search ’s    " In fake news " section was a Wordpress blog named " 70 News , " which    claimed Trump won the popular vote by a margin of almost 700 , 000 .    He    n’t . " ’    Here is what the Google results looked like at one point : ’ ’   ’ "    To the average person , the above page might look as if Google Google , the company Google "    But it had n’t Google   " ’    How is that possible ?   ’ ’This is particularly    confusing for users on the desktop version of Google’ ’s site ,    where the " In the news " section lives . ’ ’    Not only does the " In the news " the news have the word    " news " in its name , but the "In the news" section link at the bottom of the module ,    which says " More news for   …    " takes you to the separate Google    News page , which is comprised only of articles that Google’ ’s    editorial system has approved .    ’ ’   ’ ’    Given these two factors , it’ ’s not a stretch that you might assume    the results in that little box are from Google News . Often Google   News are . But these two factors aren’’t always , as these two factors by " 70 News . " ’ "    The newsy boxes appear to be a loophole in Google ’s system that    provides another way for false information to seep into the    public consciousness under the guise of trusted facts .   " "    While the viral nature of Facebook ’s social media platform has    been blamed for much of the recent spread of false news , Google ’s    efforts to Google itself    the world ’s Google stop on the web    has created another breeding ground for fake news that is    still not completely understood .   " ’    So why is n’t the " In the news " section just the top three Google    News results ? Google    The short answer is because Google sees Google Search and Google Google News as separate products Google ’    The longer answer might have to do with advertising dollars .    Google News does not include any advertising Google   News helps Google    avoid recriminations from news publishers Google of whom are    already angry about losing traffic to Google , that Google is    profiting from their work .   Google "    Google ’s some of whom search page , on the other Google does have    advertising .   " ’    By featuring a    of news stories on its main search    page , Google can generate ad revenue alongside popular news    articles Google are not technically " Google News , " while providing    a link to its    Google News section . ( Google declined    Google News comment on this aspect ) . Google ’    Whatever the reason for the separation , the branding and    placement of the " In the news " section    likely to    mislead users into thinking it ’s a Google News    .   ’ ’    ’ ’    The goal of Google News is to showcase the work of bona fide Google News sites , with authoritative voices . Publications have to apply to    be part of Google News , and can be    down . ’ ’ Google News let over 75 , 000 publications onto    this platform , and there is a form anyone can use to report any    bad behavior , which can get publishers kicked off . ’ ’    Google ’s search results , in contrast , are not editorially vetted ,    or assessed for " truth . " Google ’s    still do a good job    at sniffing out fake sites because Google is set    to catch    " spam . " But Google ’s algorithms will likely never be 100 % perfect    at Google what information on a website is inaccurate    ’ ’    Google does , however , seem to want to wipe fake news Google its    platform . ’ ’    " From our perspective , Google should just be ’ ’       fake news gets distributed , so we are all for doing better here , "    Google CEO Sundar Pichai our recently . After the issue of fake    news entered the spotlight after the election , Google announced    it would ban    sites from its ad network , choking off       Google . ’       But    if Google ’s goal is          sites out of its    search engine Google Google users probably understand that Google    search results    n’t have carry the editorial Google of approval    from Google " ’    But this expectation gets more complicated when it comes to    Search sections like " Top Stories " or " In the news this expectation " ’ ’    When you search for something that relates to news on your    smartphone , Google will often present you with a carousel of    stories at the top labeled " Top stories . " ’ ’    Here is what it looks like : ’ ’   ’ ’    ’ ’    What ties all those " Top stories " together is that they are AMP    sites , Google ’s    project to promote      webpages . Basically all those "Top stories" together any website that conforms to Google set of    technical standards gets labeled an AMP site by Google , and gets    an " AMP " tag ( with a AMP    lightning bolt Google . ’ ’    One of the perks of being an AMP site is that you have the chance    to appear in the " Top stories AMP    carousel . ’ ’    But though the " Top stories " carousel might strike you as similar    to Google News when the "Top stories" carousel views AMP as a    technical description , not as an editorial product . Anyone can    publish an AMP site , and the pages do n’t even have to be             Ebay is one , for instance . ’ ’    Because of this stance , Google has no plans to have humans make    any editorial decisions about AMP pages . ’ ’    The " Google the news " section rests in a similar situation . It is AMP    " Search " product not a " News " product , and so is not editorially    vetted . And while Google ’s algorithms are good , the " 70 News "    situation shows they can be gamed . ’ ’ Google whole situation seems like an easy fix for Google : Have the       that appear to be news only pull from Google News , which    has stricter oversight Google ’ ’Update : A source familiar with the matter says    Google has plans to remove the " In the news " section from its    desktop search . ’
