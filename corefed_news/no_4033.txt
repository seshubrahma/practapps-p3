An open letter to the Hollywood Elite and the rest of America:[My Dear friends and colleagues ,   I have recently been pondering President Trump ’s executive action with regard to our nation having extreme vetting and our immigration policy finally being enforced . It has pained me deeply to see such a violent reaction to something that , to my mind , makes absolute common sense . Let me begin by saying that I am from a family of immigrants that came to this country for a better life . They came to the US " legally , " assimilated , integrated , and learned English to the best of They ability , and demanded They speak it . As we all know , They live in a time in which there are forces who wish to destroy They way of life . There are thousands of illegal immigrant criminals in the United States whose country of origin will not take thousands of illegal immigrant criminals in the United States whose country of origin will not take them back back . thousands of illegal immigrant criminals in the United States whose country of origin will not take them back are free on the streets of America . They have recently heard from a plethora of Hollywood stars on this issue   —    Meryl Streep , Robert DeNiro , Ashley Judd , Madonna , major agencies , musicians , singers and even the indomitable Shia LaBeouf . After much prayer on this issue , I must now stand in solidarity with all of my Hollywood elite brethren . They are right ! The rest of you are wrong ! It is now in this spirit that I make an appeal to all in Hollywood Hollywood the media for us to use the Oscars to take a stand for the entire world to see and hear . It is time for Hollywood Hollywood lead the way . I propose that Meryl Steep , Chelsea Handler , Richard Gere , Robert DeNiro , Christoph Waltz and others lead an Oscar first : let ’s do away with the rules , barriers , and tickets to the Oscars and    such as the swanky Vanity Fair party or the Weinsteins’    affair . I ask all migrants , all illegal immigrant criminals and all    refugees to converge on Hollywood to come to the Oscars and all the    even those held at the mansions or the Chateau Marmont or anywhere else . After all , we in the Hollywood Hollywood want to show all Islamic extremists that we we love in our we   —    and what better way to do that than by inviting them all Islamic extremists on our we important night ? It ’s time the walls and electronic security gates come down . There are roughly 3 , 600 seats to the Oscars we should have at least 2 , 500 seats reserved for illegal aliens , refugees and migrants , or maybe even more . For those celebrities skipping the ceremony , each should invite at least 100 illegal aliens , refugees or migrants to come to their at least 100 illegal aliens, refugees or migrants to watch the the Oscars them . at least 100 illegal aliens, refugees or migrants Academy and the Vanity Fair people should also get the 150 criminals who have recently been deported from Los Angeles and bring them to the Vanity Fair people show as honored guests . I find it curious that when President Obama did the same exact thing   —    and more   —    in terms of enforcing the law on illegal immigration , the Hollywood elite were silent . Why were they silent when President Obama did the same exact thing  —   and more  —   in terms of enforcing the law on illegal immigration, the Hollywood elite were silent , but are so vocal now when President Trump is doing basically the same thing ? Is Hollywood racist ? Why   —    when Christians are being slaughtered in Syria , Iraq , and other places in the Middle East   —    is Hollywood silent Hollywood Of course , the people that wish death upon Christians , Jews , gay people and the West are greeted with open arms by the elite in Hollywood   Hollywood    so why ca n’t they come the people that wish death upon Christians, Jews, gay people and the West our Oscar the people that wish death upon Christians, Jews, gay people and the West ? Additionally , I am now pleased to announce that Hollywood and Hollywood recording industry no longer require the protection of the Men in Blue at any of their events the Men We do not need a country of laws only a country of illegal immigrants , refugees and migrants . How dare we ignore We words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty : " Give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free   …     " So now , we ask We all : please come to the Oscars on February 26th at the Dolby Theater on Hollywood Boulevard . We welcome We to our homes We open arms and love in our hearts We Together , let us celebrate We Progressive left and its policies Progressive which have helped make blue collar America Tired , Hungry , and Poor . And the Oscar goes to   …        With love in my heart , Robert Davi
