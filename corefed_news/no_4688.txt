Sunday on CNN ’s " State of the Union , " while discussing the current Republican House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare , Sen. Tom Cotton ( ) said , " I simply think that it ’s not going to work to bring down premiums in Arkansas or for working Americans around the country . "   Partial transcript as follows : TAPPER : Turning to Obamacare , you ’ve been very critical of the bill supported by our previous guest Dr. Price , President Trump , House Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare . You ’ve warned that this bill could put the House Republican majority at risk . One major concern about the plan is the way the plan might impact lower income Americans . You come fromArkansass which is one of the poorest states in the country . If you were designing the plan on your own , would you get rid of theMedicaidd expansion that brought coverage to 250 , 000 people in your state ? COTTON : Jake , first , let me say I served with Tom Price in the House of Representatives and consider Tom Price in the House of Representatives a good friend . Tom Price in the House of Representatives had legislation as a congress congressman that I think is a lot better than the house bill currently under consideration . TheMedicaidd expansion I think needs to be part of Medicaid transformation and that ’s what the house bill moved forward . It can be improved to some degree , but it ’s It a 70 % or 80 % solution , Jake . the bigger problem with legislation as a congress congressman that I think is a lot better than the house bill currently under consideration is on the private insurance market . I simply think that it legislation as a congress congressman that I think is a lot better than the house bill currently under consideration not going to work to bring down premiums in Arkansas or for working Americans around the country . We need to roll our sleeves and We those problems rear than trying to rush to some arbitrary deadline . Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
