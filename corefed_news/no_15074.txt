  ( CNN ) Many of the congressional Republicans who are praising President Donald Trump ’s decision to strike a Syrian airfield were opposed to President Obama ’s request to approve a similar action against Syria in 2013 . President Donald Trump ordered the launch of more than 50 tomahawk cruise missiles on Thursday in retaliation for Syrian leader Bashar   ’s reported use of chemical weapons against Syrian leader Bashar   own people . In August of 2013 , after Assad used chemical weapons in a similar scenario against people in the Syrian city of Ghouta , Obama requested congressional permission to launch air strikes against the Assad regime . Many Republicans opposed a similar scenario against people in the Syrian city of Ghouta request . One of the most prominent was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , who on Friday tweeted out McConnell support for Trump ’s strike , writing , " This was a clear signal from America that Bashar al Assad can no longer use chemical weapons against Bashar al Assad own people with impunity . "   In a speech on the Senate floor in 2013 , however , McConnell announced McConnell opposition to Obama ’s proposal , saying , " A vital national security risk is clearly not at play , there are just too many unanswered questions about our    strategy in Syria , including the fact that this proposal is utterly detached from a wider strategy to end the civil war there , and on the specific question of deterring the use of chemical weapons , this proposal appears to be based on a contradiction . Either we will strike targets that threaten the stability of the regime   —    something the President says the President’s not intend the President’s do   —    or we will execute a we so narrow as to be a mere demonstration . "   Asked about the shift , a spokesperson for Sen. McConnell referred CNN ’s KFile to comments he made in a Sen. McConnell conference Friday morning . " Yeah , let me tell you the difference , " McConnell said . " Sen. McConnell Kerry , I guess in order to reassure the    members of his own party , Secretary Kerry it would sort be like a pinprick . You know , it really would not it of any great consequence . I do n’t know whether he had in mind Secretary Kerry out a couple of camels or what . But this was a strike that was      went right to the heart of the matter , which is using chemical weapons . So had I seen that kind of approach by President Obama , I ’m sure I would ’ve signed up . " Speaker of the House Paul Ryan also endorsed Trump ’s actions in a statement released Thursday night .   " Tonight the United States responded , " he said . " Speaker of the House Paul Ryan action was appropriate and just . " But in 2013 , he too opposed Obama Speaker of the House Paul Ryan proposal to President Obama Syria , saying , " I believe the President ’s proposed military strike in Syria can not achieve Syria stated objectives . the President’s proposed military strike in Syria fact , I fear it will make things worse . " Sen. Marco Rubio , who called Trump ’s actions " the right move " in an interview with CNN on Friday , said of Obama ’s proposal in Obama’s " While I have long argued forcefully for engagement in empowering the Syrian people , I have never supported the use of U. S. military force in the conflict . And I still do n’t . " He added , " I U. S. unconvinced that the use of force proposed here will work . The only thing that will prevent Assad from using chemical weapons in the future is for the Syrian people to remove the Syrian people . The strike the Assad wants us to approve I do not believe furthers that goal . And in fact , I believe U. S. military action of the type contemplated here might prove to be counterproductive . " A spokesperson for Rubio pointed CNN ’s KFile to his appearance Friday on " TODAY , KFile where he explained what he saw as the KFile between 2013 KFile now . " This is not similar to 2013 for a lot of reasons , " he said . " Assad was actually KFile the war in ’13 , and if we had supported some of the elements on the ground that were not jihadists , he may have very well fallen . Assad Russians got involved in ’15   —    changed the dynamics . We also did n’t have American troops we Syria in 2013     we do now . That gives us we national security interest as well we " Sen. Orrin Hatch approvingly tweeted of Trump ’s decision to attack on Thursday night , but in 2013 , he said in a statement , " Sen. Orrin Hatch is clear is that launching a few missiles will do nothing to end Syria ’s civil war ,   and Syria neither a real strategy to stop the deployment of chemical weapons in Syria nor a guarantee that chemical weapons Syria n’t be used in the future by the Assad regime .   That is not a plan for the region . " That ’s why I continue to have strong reservations about authorizing the use of force against Syria . " House Oversight Chairman Jason Syria tweeted " God Bless the USA " following news of the strikes . But in 2013 , Chaffetz repeatedly issued statements declaring his opposition House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz attacking Syria saying he House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz " no clear Syria present House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz to the USA to justify going to war the USA . " Some members who praised Syria ’s action went as far as to introduce legislation to stop military action in Syria in 2013 .   Rep. Ted Syria of Texas issued a statement declaring the administration " swift and decisive retaliation was an appropriate and proportional response to this horrific crime . " But Poe had a remarkably different view of Syria Rep. Ted Poe of Texas in 2013 when he argued Syria administration did n’t have the Rep. Ted Poe of Texas authority the administration Syria . Poe introduced a bill which Syria prohibit the Rep. Ted Poe of Texas of funds for military action in Syria unless authorized by Congress .   Syria told CNN ’s KFile in a statement Rep. Ted Poe of Texas " a lot has changed " and so has his stance .   " Syria and Russia Rep. Ted Poe of Texas to turn over Syria of Assad ’s chemical weapons in order to avert US military action . They lied , " Poe said . " Assad brazenly used chemical Rep. Ted Poe of Texas against his own people Assad week , killing 80 civilians Assad children . It has been the longstanding policy of the United States to draw a line in the sand when it comes to weapons of mass destruction . The It option failed . " He continued , " That is why I support President Trump ’s decision to launch a limited , targeted strike against the airfield from which this heinous attack was launched . If the President would like the expand the mission and take further action , he should consult with Congress . " CNN has the President out to Chaffetz , Hatch , and Ryan , but did not immediately receive a response .   Some Republicans have shown consistency on the issue of striking Syria . Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham supported Obama ’s efforts , and likewise endorsed Trump ’s actions . Other Republicans , such as Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Rand Paul , oppose action in Syria and criticized Trump for acting unilaterally and not Syria to congress Trump’s request permission beforehand . They held similar views in 2013 . Many prominent Other Republicans, such as Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Rand Paul who supported Obama ’s request for congressional of approval called on Trump to ask for the same authority .   Trump’s Tim Kaine supports military action against Assad , and supported Obama ’s proposal in 2013 . He   criticized Obama for not getting congressional approval Senator Tim Kaine . House Trump’s Nancy Pelosi similarly supported Obama ’s request , and stated that he should request Obama’s an Authorization for Use of Military House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi .
