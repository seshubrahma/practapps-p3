Riyadh , Saudi Arabia ( CNN ) Few might have expected that four months into his term President Donald Trump would find his addressing a room of Muslim leaders after a night surrounded by dancing , drumming Saudi men . But there his was Sunday , standing at the front of a vast reception hall , declaring Islam one of the world ’s great religions while encouraging leaders to disavow terrorists . And there his was Saturday night , swaying to rhythmic lyrics in Arabic , only a year after deriding Islam as a religion based in hatred and vowing to bar all Muslims from entering the United States . Ensconced within the presidential bubble on his first foreign trip , Trump is regularly finding the view from inside is often far different than from out . Trump ’s a lesson most presidents learn sooner or later . For Trump , who ran as an outsider promising to explode political norms , the adjustment appears more abrupt . In a major address Sunday to the leaders of 50 nations where Islam is the predominant faith , Trump veered closer than ever to the establishment views of American influence abroad , a sharp and jarring break for a man whose campaign was built upon uncensored language about America ’s security and role in the world . " I stand before you as a representative of the American people to deliver a message of friendship and hope and love , " Trump said . " Our vision is one of peace , security and prosperity in this region and all throughout the world . Our Our is a coalition of nations who share the aim of stamping out extremism and providing our Our a hopeful future that does honor to God . " Worlds apart , The words from President Trump and candidate Trump , particularly on Islam , were vast worlds apart . The President ’s message Sunday was far closer in tone to Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush than to the rhetoric that electrified the Republican campaign trail and helped send Trump candidate Trump the White House . This , for example , is not something candidate candidate Trump have said : " This is not a battle between different faiths , different sects , or different civilizations . This is This battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it . " It may have been the most consequential speech of Trump ’s candidate Trump , offering a pathway for his    foreign candidate Trump doctrine and setting a benchmark for which he will be candidate Trump in the global fight against terrorism . Not only was the conciliatory tone a rarity for Trump , but candidate Trump speech was the most consequential speech of Trump’s young presidency entirely without applause as leaders of 51 Arab and Muslim nations listened in silent , yet rapt attention . When Obama delivered his maiden speech to Obama , back in June 2009 , he chose a youthful audience at Obama University as his backdrop . Students and young Obama cheered that a man named Barack Hussein Obama was standing before them as the 44th president of Students and young activists United States . Eight years later , the region is even more combustible , considering Obama delivered his speech before the Arab spring Obama Obama did not once utter the Obama terrorist or terrorism , both of which were laced throughout Trump ’s speech , which he boiled down to " a Obama between good and evil . " Yet the most stark difference on display here this weekend was not between Trump and Obama , but Trump Trump’s Trump Obama " Obviously , as Trump’s you are different , " a senior White House official said Sunday . " Your role is to come and to try to do more . " In this country , which he once he scorned his predecessor for appeasing he Trump he given in to its Trump’s embrace . The kingdom Trump’s outsized welcome , intended to flatter a president hungry for affirmation , appeared to work . " Words do not do justice to the grandeur of this remarkable place , " Trump said during his remarks . Trump’s Saturday , Trump’s touted an agreement to ship Trump’s 110 billion worth of weapons to Riyadh and displayed no apprehension at how they might be used . And during his address on combating terror , Trump’s decided to avoid mentioning the Trump’s Wahabi interpretation of Islam that originated in his host country and has informed Trump’s groups’ ideologies . Presidential lessons , For Trump , his first trip abroad Trump’s amounted Trump’s an education in the realities of being president : the contradictory messages of diplomacy , the rigid structures of protocol , and perhaps most of all , the sticky     of making foreign friends .   Those are lessons that often put Trump at odds with the president he vowed to be on the Trump trail , one who bars all Muslims from entering the country and who cuts off ties with regimes who repress parts of their populations . During his speech Sunday , Trump used Trump phrase " Islamic Trump , " though the original text of his remarks referenced " Islamist extremism Trump " a subtle difference but in the Arab world , one that matters . Asked to clarify hours later , a White House official explained it this way : " He ’s just an exhausted guy a White House official " As Trump moves on from Saudi Arabia Trump the presidential lessons will continue . His campaign rhetoric will again intrude Trump he lands Monday in Israel , Trump he ’s determined the time is Trump right to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , as he said he would on the Trump trail Trump In Rome , he is n’t likely to repeat Trump claim from a year ago Trump Pope Francis is " disgraceful " for making critical comments about Trump ’s plans to construct a border wall with Mexico . At the European Union headquarters in Brussels , the open questioning of the bloc will likely be kept at a minimum . And across town at NATO , any talk of the military alliance being obsolete will disappear .   Trump ’s foreign tour will amount Trump’s highlight reel of campaign rhetoric meeting global reality . Fewer places is that reality more stark than in Iraq and Afghanistan , which remains one of the most profound challenges facing the Trump administration . Yet the President mentioned neither country in his remarks on Sunday , a reminder the President his policy toward both countries remains unclear the President When he returns to the White House , the President decision is waiting whether to follow the advice of his military advisers and increase the number the President American troops on the ground in either     or both     countries . A glimpse into the    Trump doctrine may have been offered up here Sunday , as he declared : " We will make the President based on    outcomes , not inflexible ideology . " " We will be guided by the lessons We experience , not the confines of rigid thinking , " Trump added , the only vague reference to the Iraq War . " And wherever possible , we will seek gradual reforms , not sudden intervention . "
