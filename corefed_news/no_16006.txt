Washington ( CNN ) British voters just shattered political convention in a stunning repudiation of the ruling establishment . Donald Trump is betting America is about to do the same . Voters in the UK did more than reject the European Union and topple Voters in the UK    Prime Minister David Cameron in a referendum Thursday . Voters in the UK also set off a cascade of events that could spark global economic chaos , remake the Western world , reverberate through the U. S. election     and challenge U. S. security for years to come . At Trump news conference , it ’s all about him , The referendum campaign     just like the U. S. election     has boiled with populist anger ,    by politicians , hostility towards distant political elites and resurgent nationalism , and exposed a visceral feeling in the electorate that ordinary voters have lost control of the politics that shape their own lives ordinary voters Its success raises ordinary voters question of whether those forces will exert a similar influence in America in November . The presumptive Republican presidential nominee , who arrived in the UK to visit his Scottish golf courses just as the referendum result was announced , declared Friday that the U. S. is next . " Come November , the November people will have the chance to    their independence . the American people will have a chance to vote for trade , immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first , " he said . " They will have Americans chance to reject today ’s rule by the global elite , and to embrace real change that delivers a government of , by and for the people . " Indeed , British voters delivered the kind of crushing rejection of the political , business and media elites that Trump has been railing against . The Brits also snubbed President Barack Obama ’s warnings against voting to leave Europe and risked triggering a global recession that would weaken already sluggish U. S. economic growth and dampen the hopes of his chosen successor President Barack Obama Hillary Clinton . In her first reaction to the news from Britain , Clinton immediately took Hillary Clinton swipe at Trump , though not by name . She called for Hillary Clinton to respond to the vote by pulling together " to solve our challenges as a country , not tear each other down . " Clinton also noted Hillary Clinton global economic risks of the UK referendum , saying in a statement : " Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America . "   In a particularly striking development , UK voters completely disregarded warnings from elite voices of the consequences of tearing the political system that has largely delivered peace and prosperity since World War II . Similar warnings have been heard in the U. S. election     especially from Clinton and establishment politicians who fear Trump ’s " America First " America would send shockwaves through the global system and see America pull back America its role as the global system guarantor of Western security . But in the UK this week , outsider politicians seem to have carried just as much weight with many British voters as more conventional    arguments . World authorities like the IMF for example warned about the consequences of a Brexit     but voters went ahead and voted to leave anyway . RELATED : Can Donald Trump be a CEO and a president ? Speaking to CNN , former British Prime Minister Tony Blair described the Brexit result a Brexit     " big experiment in insurgent politics . " He said the    former British Prime Minister Tony Blair    needed to " rediscover radical , powerful answers in a climate driven by anger . .. a revolt against what is seen as established wisdom , but what is actually people making difficult decisions in difficult circumstances . " There are , of course , several key differences between the British referendum and America ’s looming election . The UK vote was mostly about delivering a stunning and final blow to the country ’s long America marriage with Europe and turned on a host of local factors including extreme    within the governing Conservative Party , distrust of European politicians and institutions and disenchantment with Britain ’s reduced place in the world . Trump : Brexit a declaration of independence   But in a larger symbolic sense , the referendum result , narrow as it was     52 % to 48 %     demonstrated the potential of voters to wield a stunning shock to the political system that can shatter the logic and assumptions of conventional politics . There ’s no guarantee that American voters will show the same kind of rebelliousness and willingness to leap into the unknown in November as a slim majority of Britons did on Thursday . And the U. S. system of     races and an electoral college could mitigate against some of the grassroots anger that exploded in a binary " Leave " or " Remain " vote in Britain . But events in Europe must trigger at least some concern among Democrats . Pollsters in the UK underestimated the fury of grassroots voters outside metropolitan areas in a way that could be mirrored in the United States , where Clinton now enjoys a lead in national surveys . Furthermore , " Brexit " forces triumphed partly because the Labour Party could not deliver its traditional working class voters the Labour Party some big    cities for the " Remain " campaign , despite the support of party leaders . It is not a stretch to wonder whether the kind of political message that was so powerful in the referendum     featuring a harsh critique of free trade and a demands to " take our country back "     could prove just as effective among    workers in rust belt states in the United States . Certainly , it ’s a message that Trump has been hammering with success all election season and is at the center of his claims to be able Trump remake the U. S. electoral map . And the billionaire has consistently bested Clinton when voters are asked who is best equipped to handle the economy . The immediate stock market contagion unleashed by the referendum across the globe represented the worst equity carnage since the start of the Great Recession in 2008 . If the losses prove    the impact of the referendum on the U. S. economy and politics could be temporary . But if " Brexit " ushers in a period of economic volatility across Europe that begins to squelch growth , the U. S. economy could be badly affected     complicating Clinton ’s bid to pull off the tough assignment of winning a third consecutive White House term for the Democrats . Trump would meanwhile seize on any slowdown in the U. S. precipitated by Brexit to argue that Obama ’s economic management is a failure and it is time to try something new . But there are also warning signs for Trump . Though he was Trump to claim Trump share of the credit for the British political earthquake     placing it in the context of the British political earthquake     revolt against global elites in which he sees himself as a Trump player Trump a prolonged period of world turmoil could also work against the billionaire former reality star . Such an environment could bolster Clinton ’s claims that a crisis is no time to choose a president who has no experience of governing and that her pedigree as a former Clinton of state and relationships with leaders all over the world are a perfect fit for a perilous moment . The Democratic presumptive nominee made that argument in her statement : " This Clinton of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm , steady , experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans’ pocketbooks and livelihoods , to support our friends and allies , to stand up to our adversaries , and to our our interests . " Her our later issued a Clinton appeal with that message , writing , " No matter what the collective wisdom of our political punditry has to say between now and November , Donald Trump has a real chance of winning this election . " Clinton ’s campaign worked hard to demonstrate a contrast between Clinton and Trump as potential Clinton in Donald Trump time of crisis . The Clinton camp also sought to Clinton similarities between the seething political scenes in the U. K. and the United States . " It is important that we recognize that this American election is about what is happening here in America not what is happening in Yorkshire or in Cardiff , " said Clinton ’s senior adviser Jake Clinton on a conference call . Sullivan also rejected the idea Clinton’s senior adviser Jake Sullivan on a conference call Clinton could find herself overtaken Clinton a similar Clinton tide in November , saying November had spent months on Clinton campaign trail and was intimately familiar with the difficulties facing many working Americans .

Britain ’s referendum has already Britain off calls in Europe for similar Europe votes in other Eurosceptic nations , threatening to dismantle the economic and political union that has been a pillar of transatlantic stability for 70 years and been a crucial partner for the United States . As the United States faces challenges to its the U. S. from a rising China and the U. S. Europe from a Europe Russia and in the Middle East from a motley group of insurgent forces , Washington can hardly afford the splintering of the United States    of Western security . In the United States , the referendum looks likely to result in the fracturing Britain’s referendum ’s closest America ally , the United Kingdom America factor that could be a diplomatic nightmare for the next president . In the hours after the vote , Scotland ’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced plans to draft new legislation to allow a second independence referendum north of the border after    Scots narrowly voted to stay in the United Kingdom in 2014 .
