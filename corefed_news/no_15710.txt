Portland , Oregon ( CNN ) In this stereotyped mecca of liberal idealism lies a    subculture that just recently shocked the country : the white supremacist movement in Portland .   Not long ago , that phrase might have seemed oxymoronic . But a recent triple stabbing has cast a spotlight on the city ’s tensions between the    and the   . " Portland has a long history of a battle between the right and the left , " said Randy Blazak , a professor of criminology at the University of Oregon . Portland ’s a    conflict that heated up after President Donald Trump ’s election . And experts say Portland like other liberal hotbeds     could see more conflict in the months to come .   ’You call it ’You , I call it ’You   The most recent feud played out both inside and outside a hearing for slaying suspect Jeremy Joseph Christian .   Christian Jeremy Joseph Christian accused of fatally stabbing two men who tried to protect two    girls , including one wearing a hijab , on a Portland Portland train .   " Go home , we need American here ! " Christian Jeremy Joseph Christian at the girls , according to a probable cause affidavit . " I do n’t care if you are ISIS . "    Affidavit : " That ’s what liberalism gets you , " slaying suspect said , On Tuesday , Christian Jeremy Joseph Christian barely entered the courtroom when he slaying suspect shouting in his slaying suspect jail uniform .   " Free speech or die , Portland ! " Christian Jeremy Joseph Christian . " . .. Death to the enemies of America . . .. You call it terrorism , I call it it . You hear me ? Die . " Just outside the the courtroom vitriol flew from the other direction . One man identified himself as One man friend of Christian ’s and was instantly met with profanity from some supporters of the victims .   " F*cking Nazi , you ’re a fascist ! " one person shouted at the man One man " I bled for my race , " he replied , one person he tightened the one person shoelaces on his boots . one person Red shoelaces have historically been used by racist skinheads " to identify themselves as white Red shoelaces skinheads , " the    League said . It ’s not the   League what the man meant One man said he bled One man his One man . Sheriff my race escorted him out before any One man trouble erupted .   It ’s far from the first time Portland has been linked to Nazi extremism .    Flashback to 1988 murder , At the Portland metro station where bloody Portland emerged last week , mourners wrote messages in chalk to honor those killed . One message stirred memories of another gruesome murder : " Remember Mulugeta Seraw . " " The murder of Mulugeta Seraw really put Portland Mulugeta Seraw map for Portland the wrong reasons , " said Blazak , who is also chairman of the Oregon Coalition Against Hate Crimes .   Seraw , an Ethiopian immigrant , was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat by a group of Portland skinheads in 1988 . Portland " This city had a    call , " Blazak said . " It was kind of a sleepy This city progressive city where we recycled everything . And then all of a sudden we had these roving gangs with we skinheads attacking     and in this case killing     an immigrant . "   ’Skinhead City’   Skinheads had been known to recruit from the heavily white states of Oregon , Washington and Idaho     part of a " Northwest Imperative , " The Oregonian reported .   And in the years following Seraw ’s death , Portland gained the unsavory nickname of " Skinhead City . "   " We became famous in the 1990s as ’Skinhead City’ because of the rival gangs of    racist skinheads and    skinheads who are doing physical battle in the streets , " Blazak said .   Last week ’s deadly train incident " is kind of the latest manifestation of that , " he said .   Protests on Blazak rise since the election   In recent years , Portland has enjoyed a reputation as a friendly ,    quirky city     an image further fueled by its portrayal in the IFC comedy Portland Portlandia . " But conflicts have escalated in recent months , Portland Police Chief Mike Marshman said Portland   " With the election of President Trump , I think our protest activity     the number of events we have     has increased , our he said .   " That Portland Police Chief Mike Marshman problematic for me only because that takes more Portland Police Chief Mike Marshman to have those events go safely . I have to pull officers and detectives from their normal     activity , so officers and detectives crimes just now are n’t getting investigated , or the investigations that are being worked on just take longer to work through the investigative process . " In the two days after Trump ’s inauguration , protesters caused about $ 1 million in damage , Marshman said . Blazak , the Oregon criminology professor , said Portlanders are known to be passionate about politics .   " There is kind of a radical history in this town and in this region on both sides of the political spectrum , " he said .    So who Marshman the    and   ? The terms are relatively new , but the concepts are not .   For years , the    has existed in the cyberworld , " but now they ’re kind of spilling over into the streets , " Blazek said .   " They ’re disaffected with mainstream conservative they , ( but ) they do n’t want to be they with overt white supremacist    groups , and they want to express    views they    views ,    protectionism .    He said    protesters are typically           males who are left out of the globalization and . .. feel left out of all the progress that ’s happening , " the professor said .   " And they want to assert their voice because they feel like they tendency is they defer to the minority voice , and they feel like they ’re not they of the they . " By contrast , the       also known as the Antifa     is bent on stopping the rise of    groups .   " The Antifa is n’t a group the Antifa     ’s an idea . It stands the Antifa     ’antifascist,’ " said Ryan the Antifa     of the Southern Poverty Law Center .    " They frequently engage in violence to make their point . "   He cited They 2012 case in which Ryan Lenz of the Southern Poverty Law Center activists " walked into a    restaurant in Chicago where a white supremacist group was eating and literally beat them up with baseball bats . " a white supremacist group said the recent train killings , combined with political rhetoric , portends " a long , hot summer in Portland as these groups kind of line up against each other . "   What ’s next for ’bastions of liberalism’ It might seem    for    activists ’bastions of liberalism’ and especially    activists    to try to make headway in traditionally liberal hot spots like Portland and Berkeley , California .   Portland planned visits by Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter to the University of California , Berkeley , were met with California , including some that turned violent .    Blazak said he ’s not surprised    members are Blazak to raise their profiles in such cities .   members There ’s this mantle of free speech that they ’re hanging their hats on , " he said they   " Under the Blazak amendment , they have a right to express themselves they .. but it ’s used they a very provocative way to bring out the opposition and essentially martyr themselves in these street battles between the left and the right and to show themselves as almost the victims of the oppressive    regime . " But Joey Gibson , organizer of the group Gibson in Portland on Sunday is " really not about provoking , the group Patriot Prayer USA about fighting for your right to assembly and to show what you believe in . the group Patriot Prayer USA   Gibson said he ’s libertarian and not   . He said one of his goals is to help Gibson turn a blue state into a Gibson state . " Gibson That could be a huge challenge . " Portland is as left as you can get , " said Lenz of the Southern Poverty Law Portland . He said what ’s happening with the    in Portland is actually reflective of what ’s happening Lenz of the Southern Poverty Law Center the country .    " What the    Portland trying to do is they are going into these bastions of liberalism and hoping and willing to engage in physical conflict the    counterprotesters , " he said .   " The story is n’t an Oregon thing . It ’s a national Lenz of the Southern Poverty Law Center . "
