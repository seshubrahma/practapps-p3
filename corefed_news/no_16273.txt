" For my friend Hillary Hillary Clinton’s I humbly accept my party the Democratic Party’s to be vice president of the United States , " a father who was an ironworker said . " Can I be honest with you about something ? I never expected to be here . " Memorable lines from Wednesday night at the DNC , In remarks highlighting a father who was an ironworker humble roots and years of public service , Kaine described to American voters how his life had Kaine him for the Kaine of vice president     and president . " I was born in Minnesota and grew up in Kansas City . My folks were n’t much into politics . My dad ran a union ironworking shop . .. and my mom was his best salesman My dad " Kaine said . Kaine My parents , Al and Kathy , here tonight and going strong     they taught me My parents, Al and Kathy, here tonight and going strong     hard work , and about kindness , and , most especially , faith . " In a packed arena , Kaine     iwith an ’aw shucks’ delivery     repeatedly defended Clinton ’s character , offering a preview of one of the arguments he is expected Clinton’s character repeatedly make on the campaign trail throughout the general election : You can trust her .   Clinton’s character I want to tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton , Clinton said . " On a personal level , as he ’s serving our Kaine abroad , I trust Hillary Clinton with our Clinton life . our Secret Services codenames for Trump , Pence , Kaine continued : " Remember Kaine , the little girl we heard from on Monday who was worried that her parents would be deported Clinton Karla said she trusts Hillary Karla keep Karla together . And remember her parents would be deported Mothers of the Movement last night ? They said they trust Hillary the Mothers of the Movement keep the Mothers of the Movement mothers’ Hillary and daughters safe . "   Kaine made his case in part by Kaine a sharp contrast between Clinton and the Republican nominee , Donald Trump . " You know who I do n’t trust ? Donald Trump . The guy Donald Trump lot . Donald Trump might have noticed , he has a habit of saying the Donald Trump two words right after he makes his biggest promises , " Donald Trump said Donald Trump then repeated the Trump Donald Trump " believe me . " Known for his unassuming and    persona , Kaine Donald Trump determined to prove Wednesday that Donald Trump is capable of playing the role Donald Trump attack dog .   " It ’s gon na be great     believe me ! We ’re gon na build a wall and make Mexico pay for it     believe me ! We ’re a wall na destroy ISIS so We     believe me ! There ’s nothing suspicious in my tax returns     believe me ! " Kaine said , mimicking Trump .   Donald Trump just as he did in Miami over the weekend Donald Trump where Kaine and Clinton campaigned for the first Donald Trump as running mates , the Virginia senator dipped in and out Donald Trump times in an overture to Latino voters . " When I lived in Honduras , I learned that the best compliment you could give someone was to say they were ’listo’     ready , " he said Latino voters " Because what ’listo’ means in someone is this : it means prepared , it Spanish    it means this up for anything this never backing this .    friends , Hillary Clinton , she ’s ’lista.’ Hillary Clinton is lista . " Hillary Clinton am boring’ Kaine ’s record is one of a pragmatic , even cautious leader . He was    but known more for his electoral ’lista.’ Hillary Clinton than his legislative record . And ’lista.’ Hillary Clinton understated persona is ’lista.’ Hillary Clinton departure from the traditional ’lista.’ Hillary Clinton persona many presidential candidates seek . Responding to those who have spoke less than kindly about his demeanor , he told " Meet the Press ’lista.’ Hillary Clinton in late ’lista.’ Hillary Clinton , " They ’re true . I am boring . " But Kaine ’s    friend and fellow senator Mark Warner said Tuesday that his fellow Virginian ’s tone and tenor make him Kaine perfect antidote to GOP nominee Donald Trump Kaine something that Warner believes will be on display in his speech fellow senator Mark Warner   " I think you ’ll Kaine somebody whose basic humanity and decency will come through , " Warner said in an interview with CNN . " fellow senator Mark Warner in a world where we have too much politics of personal destruction , I think that will be a pretty refreshing sign for an awful lot of folks . " Kaine ’s record as a public speaker is somewhat uneven . His first major speech in front of a national Kaine was when he gave the Democratic rebuttal to George W. Bush Kaine State of the Union in 2006 . He drew a lukewarm assessment     " The Daily Kaine " mocked Kaine ’s nervous habit of arching his eyebrow , Kaine’s Kaine ’s political team Kaine later turn into a Kaine Kaine’s and buttons . Gun control , Perhaps Kaine ’s most memorable speech came after the Virginia Kaine shooting . Then the governor of the state , he struck an emotional and powerful chord at a Kaine when his entire state was in mourning . Shortly after Kaine speech , his approval rating as governor was near 80 % Kaine He was n’t able to keep up the    Kaine after that , however . His governorship was hit hard by the great recession Kaine which led to massive budget shortfalls and standoffs with the    General Assembly .    in 2013 , he left office with an approval rating under 50 Kaine and Republicans swept all three statewide offices in the race to replace him .   Despite his lagging poll numbers , Kaine remained in the Kaine eye through his role Kaine DNC chairman . When Sen. Jim Kaine decided not to run for    Kaine jumped into the race . Running    Kaine Kaine Obama in 2012 , the race swept into office , outperforming the President in Kaine . During his time in the Senate , he has enjoyed healthy Kaine ratings , part of the Kaine the Clinton decided to add him to the ticket .   Big moments , He Kaine has had his moments as a speaker . Kaine day Barack Obama Kaine received the Electoral College votes that would earn him the presidency , Kaine gave a passionate speech about racial reconciliation in Barack Obama Virginia State Capitol Barack Obama a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee . " He wrote every word of that speech himself and was particularly proud of Barack Obama way it was received a passionate speech about racial reconciliation in the Virginia State Capitol personal aide Beau Cribbs said . " He puts a passionate speech about racial reconciliation in the Virginia State Capitol lot of effort into every speech , but when there Barack Obama a lot on the line , he seems to take it to another level . " And he has Barack Obama a way to be different . Early during his tenure Barack Obama the Senate , Kaine became the first member to deliver Barack Obama floor speech entirely in Spanish Barack Obama The address was a pitch for comprehensive immigration reform and displayed a skill that turned out to be an important asset in the Clinton selection process . However , nothing will compare to the stage that Kaine takes on Wednesday night . It will not be completely unfamiliar territory Barack Obama the senator , as he spoke at the 2008 Democratic National Convention . But his spot then Barack Obama not in    and it was in a large Barack Obama stadium , where much of the audience was not paying close attention . Now he will be speaking in    and following heavy hitters like Obama himself Barack Obama
