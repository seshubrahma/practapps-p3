’   ’ ’    On Wednesday ,    CEO Andy    Puzder    his name ’ "    Puzder ’s personal life likely played a role in his decision    to withdraw , as the    " ’    However , the first and biggest strike against Puzder was    identical to the top reason that Trump nominated    for the    job : the fact that    is a    CEO .   ’ ’    While Trump Trump Puzder’ ’s role as a " job creator "    to be a major plus for the secretary of labor , Puzder’ Puzder’    position as CEO of CKE Restaurants , the parent company of Carl’ ’s    Jr and Hardee’ ’s , dragged the White House into a raging labor    battle . Ultimately , neither Puzder nor the the White House    prepared to defeat the    labor movement , which    tore apart the nominee on the same restaurant industry    battlegrounds they’’d been fighting for years .   ’ "    Prime among these is the issue of minimum wage . Raising the    minimum wage has become the most prominent issue in the movement    for    workers’ rights , and the one that    organizers have found the most success , as states and cities    across the US have grown closer to the goal of a $ 15 per    hour wage . The movement to raise the minimum wage has become    increasingly popular , with " ’    While Puzder told CNBC in May that increasing minimum wage to $ 9    per hour would have a " minimal impact " on companies ’’ bottom    lines , the CEO has a history of opposing laws that would raise    workers ’’ pay . Puzder’ ’s critics   —    including groups that have years    of experience working to raise minimum wages across the US   —      cited this history again and again in argument as to why Puzder    wasn’’t fit for the role of labor secretary .   ’ ’    Puzder , meanwhile Puzder argues regulation that would increase minimum    wage would simply result in workers being replaced with    automation . ’ ’    " They’’re always polite , they always upsell , they never take they    vacation , they never show they late , there’ ’s never a       or an age , sex , or race discrimination case , " Puzder   on the potential upside    of swapping employees for machines . ’ ’ ’ "    Puzder ’s interest in automation   —    an issue that most      companies are at least considering in 2017   —      became a major argument against his confirmation , ’ ’ ’ "   Puzder’s interest in automation  —   an issue that most     companies are at least considering in 2017  —         protestors used his own words ’ ’ ’ "   Puzder’s interest in automation  —   an issue that most     companies are at least considering in 2017  —      him .   ’ ’ ’ "   Puzder’s interest in automation  —   an issue that most     companies are at least considering in 2017  —      ’    " Andy Puzder is Puzder’s , calls the minimum wage and    overtime ’’ restrictions ’’ and employees ’’ extra cost , ’’ and even said    he wants to       like us and replace us with machines    us can’’t take vacation or sue their employers when they break    the their ,    the nonprofit Interfaith Worker Justice   a Carl’ ’s Jr. cook , as saying . ’ "    Puzder also spoke out against Obamacare and overtime pay . In    essence , as CKE ’s CEO , he had already gone CKE’s the record opposing    regulation that groups like the Fight for $ 15 and the National    Employment Law Project ( NELP ) have fought to pass and protect . " "    With his nomination , organizations (NELP) for      workers’ rights went from seeing Puzder as the opponent as an    employer , to seeing him as the enemy (NELP) a potential Secretary of    Labor   —    the person tasked with protecting workers’ rights .   " ’   ’ "    As labor organizations and Democrats rallied against Puzder , they    moved beyond " ’  ’ "   As labor organizations and Democrats rallied against Puzder own statements as       CEO and began       look at Carl    Jr and Hardee ’s business practices for evidence    that he was    for    role .    —    all    that are common    problems in the    .   " ’h’ ’   ’ ’ ’ "    Ultimately , opponents framed Puzder as the embodiment of all    that needs to be fixed in the    industry . the industry worked     —    on the industry , prior to Puzder ’s withdrawal ,   " Puzder Groups like Fight for $ 15 and the NELP ’s organized opposition to    Puzder since the day he was Puzder n’t a fluke . Puzder was    a result of years of effort and working with      employees , the press , and politicians . Following news of Puzder ’s    defeat ,    workers and Puzder were happy to       the victory .   " ’    " We rallied outside Puzder ’s stores nationwide and showed America    Puzder burger empire was built on low pay , wage theft , sexual    harassment and intimidation . And today , we are on the right side    of history We " Darin Brooks , a Hardee ’s worker and a member of a    Fight for $ 15 chapter in Durham , North Carolina , said in a    statement . " This is a major victory for the Fight for $ 15 , but we    ca n’t and wo n’t back down until the Trump Administration gives us    a real labor secretary who will put working people over corporate    profits . " ’ "    Trump ’s new nomination for labor secretary , Alexander Acosta ,    will likely face opposition from the left as he awaits his    confirmation hearing . However , Trump passion Trump    , and    vitriol Puzder inspired as a symbol of the    industry    will be lacking when it comes to actually fighting the    attorney ’s nomination .
