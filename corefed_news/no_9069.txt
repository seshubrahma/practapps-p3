And it breaks my heart , it it me want to cry because I ’m Republican , I ’ve never voted for a Democrat , and to think the guy who ’s our likely standard bearer has such nonsensical ideas on every single aspect of the economy is just breathtakingly horrible . " He the guy who’s our likely standard bearer , " You know , I do n’t know what goes on in his the guy who’s our likely standard bearer . He the guy who’s our likely standard bearer a force of nature . I do n’t know what goes on in his his head But it ’s frightening that he the guy who’s our likely standard bearer no economist advisers . Carl Icahn a very smart guy on Wall Street who ’s made a great deal of money . Steve Wynn who runs best hotels in Las Vegas . But as far as economic advisers , as far as I can tell , he the guy who’s our likely standard bearer n’t have any and he the guy who’s our likely standard bearer needs some . The things he the guy who’s our likely standard bearer saying are wacky as wacky can be . Just off the charts . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
