Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has proposed building a monorail along the Interstate 405 to connect the San Fernando Valley with West Los Angeles on Tuesday , relieving traffic on one of the world ’s busiest and most congested roads . [ Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti floated the idea on   ’s " Ask the Mayor " program , according to the Los Angeles Times . Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti reportedly said that monorails could scale the relatively steep grade of the Sepulveda Pass , which the 405 passes through , while ordinary light rail can not manage the incline .   Currently , there are numerous bus links between the San Fernando Valley and the rest of Los Angeles . The L. A. Metro Red Line also links the San Fernando Valley to downtown via a station at North Hollywood . California is not short of new ideas for public transportation . Governor Jerry Brown continues to back the troubled California California Authority , which intends to link Los Los Angeles the San Francisco area through the the San Fernando Valley Tesla CEO Elon Musk is developing the Hyperloop , a new technology that proposes to link the two cities along the Interstate 5 corridor using rail pods launched within a vacuum tube . However , Californians seem to prefer their cars regardless of available Californians transportation options . Politicians seem to prefer new rail lines over existing bus lines , which are already heavily subsidized . The Times notes that the monorail could be funded through sales tax revenues collected under Measure M , which was passed by Los Angeles County voters in November and which is intended to fund transportation projects . However , there have been no steps taken to begin the development or design of a monorail . Joel B. Pollak is Senior     at Breitbart News . He was named one of Joel B.
