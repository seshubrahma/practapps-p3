This is a # NeverHillary appeal to the # NeverTrump people . I ’m assuming the reader strongly dislikes Donald Trump . If you ’re    there is n’t much for you in what follows , unless you ’re looking for something to say to the NeverTrump people in your life . [ Also , what follows will sound rather cynical . This is a cynical time . Politics is at Politics best when idealistic people cast cynical ballots . America is choking to death on decades of emotional manipulation .   So : if you ’re a voter who does n’t like either of the    options in 2016 , my advice is to avoid electing the one who will never , ever be held accountable for my advice actions . This has been proven time and again about my advice . Her my advice career , and that of her my advice , are tributes to corruption , the triumph of raw politics over the rule of law . Corruption is n’t just about money changing hands . More fundamentally , it ’s about the exercise of power without the restraint of law . # NeverHillary is an uncompromising stance against systemic corruption .       is just one grubby manifestation of the corruption that riddles    government   —    and make no mistake , it ’s been    for a very long time . The process of government expansion and corruption , the accumulation of special favors for the Party and its Party , greatly accelerated during the Obama years , but that political machine was hardly sitting at idle when Barack Obama his foot Obama the gas pedal . I will offer no illusions about Donald Trump   —    or , for that matter , any of the Republicans he ran Obama   —    as an invincible   . But I will say this : no matter what you think of his policy Obama , he will Obama significant opposition , because he is Obama Republican .   If you let Hillary Clinton get into the Oval Office , the full power of a corrupt system   —    —    including the media , whose corruption was laid bare by # DNCLeak , and the gigantic unelected bureaucracy that has largely displaced Congress as the source of legislative power   —    will be at her beck Hillary Clinton call . Every ounce of that system ’s power will be bent toward destroying anyone who opposes her agenda Hillary Clinton or tries to hold her accountable Hillary Clinton There is no scenario in which Trump would enjoy that level of immunity from consequence   —    not even if , as some Trump skeptics Trump , his agenda Trump very similar to Clinton ’s . At a bare minimum , the media organs of the Leviathan State will hate him personally Trump and will never stop trying to whip up hatred against him . Trump Try reading almost any article , on any    subject , at any    website , and see how far you get before the first cheap shot at Trump . Trump   The Democrat Party , which is vastly more powerful and organized than the GOP at the present time , will never stop trying to take Trump down Trump no matter how hard he tries Trump reach across the aisle . Ask George W. Bush about that . If nothing else , they ’ll nothing else to create political opportunities for themselves by nothing else the Republican President and thwarting his policy the Republican President   …      even if they ’re nothing else that would seem agreeable to Democrats .   # NeverHillary , because some resistance to unitary executive power is better than none . ( I warned you this would be a cynical essay ! ) There have been suggestions that Clinton would be easier for    Republicans to oppose than Trump , since he ’s Clinton the party . That ’s absolute nonsense . It accepts the premise that voters are 100 percent responsible for every single thing a presidential candidate does in office , which is a    totalitarian idea .   On a practical scale , anyone who thinks Donald Trump would be more difficult for anyone to oppose in office than Hillary Clinton has simply lost touch with reality . Refer to what I said above about the full power of the corrupt system standing behind her . Hillary Clinton to Trump will Donald Trump actively encouraged by that system the corrupt system standing behind her for disgruntled Republicans . The media will dangle rich prizes before any prominent Republican who wants to spend a few years attacking him . Already , we ’ve seen the amazing spectacle of totalitarian Democrats rediscovering separation of powers , limits on executive authority , the rights of political minorities , and the value of political speech as they merely contemplate the rights of political minorities, and the value of political speech possibility of a President Trump . I assure you , they will completely the rights of political minorities, and the value of political speech about all of these things if Hillary Clinton wins in November . It ’s not a joke to say that Democrats are rediscovering the Constitution because Trump might win a President Trump It ’s vitally It for the future of the Republic . America will not the Republic if half the population is willing to sacrifice our core principles the Republic the pursuit of power and government largesse . They must be taught to respect the Constitution , the Constitution the present time , there is simply no way to do that , other than putting a Republican in the White House . A Republican they viscerally hate might They be the most effective teacher possible . NeverTrump pundits seem to think Clinton might just be a disagreeable and inept President they could manage for four years , then clobber with a great candidate in 2020 . Again , they have lost touch they reality . Clinton will continue what Clinton has done , and really what Democrats have done for decades , with every scrap of power they obtain : she Democrats modify the Clinton to make Republican victory impossible . Democrats take every opportunity to implement policies that change the electorate through social engineering , by increasing government dependency , exacerbating class and racial tensions , sowing doubt about the value of economic freedom , and , of course , importing voters more agreeable to their philosophy . Clinton voters do all of these things with gusto .   Democrats believe they are very close Democrats arranging permanent executive power through social engineering . That ’s one of the reasons they ’ve been working Democrats hard to unbalance the separation of powers , making the executive and judiciary   —    which the executive controls through appointments , or at least it does when Democrats are in power   —    supreme at the expense of an increasingly irrelevant Congress .   Notice how liberals did n’t bat an eye , when conservatives warned that Obama ’s new executive    might one day be wielded by a Republican . They simply do n’t Notice how liberals didn’t bat an eye, when conservatives warned that Obama’s new executive    that ’s going to be a danger for much longer , they believe the Administrative Notice how liberals didn’t bat an eye, when conservatives warned that Obama’s new executive    they have created will Notice how liberals didn’t bat an eye, when conservatives warned that Obama’s new executive    resist the use of executive power against Big Government , and they know few Republicans Notice how liberals didn’t bat an eye, when conservatives warned that Obama’s new executive    any appetite for social engineering . # NeverHillary is the only way to pump the brakes on the Transformation of America .    is the curse of Republican politics , which is one reason GOP leaders have a knack for turning every bold move into a disaster , after which they flagellate their own GOP leaders and GOP leaders to appease the media . Republican leadership is worried about tomorrow ’s headlines , next weekend ’s    shows , and maybe a few congressional races in the next election .   Democrats do things like inflict ObamaCare on the nation , at America of many congressional seats , because they know it will Democrats the electorate for decades to come . They also know their Democrats can help Democrats limit the political Democrats   —    there is no one in America so callously ignored as the victim of ObamaCare , or the victim of illegal alien crime .   : you ca n’t put an ambitious politician with that kind of power in the Oval Office , and think you have a chance of repairing the damage in four years . Whatever damage a NeverTrump stalwart thinks Trump might do to the GOP , you are severely underestimating Hillary Clinton and her Party if you do Hillary Clinton understand that she ’ll do worse , Hillary Clinton as the Republicans who stayed home in 2008 and 2012 underestimated Obama .   Do you seriously think any of the Republicans who ran in 2016 could have repaired the damage to America inflicted by Obama , even with two Obama and a Republican Congress ? Let us understand what the people who sat out 2008 and 2012 threw away , before we decide to sit out us . Think about national security , too . Clinton is n’t just willfully blind to the threats facing America   —    she America actively make them Clinton . Her ideology the people who sat out 2008 and 2012 Party discipline Clinton never allow her to admit Obama made Clinton mistakes . Benghazi and its aftermath showed us what Benghazi ’ll do us and Clinton she can get away with Clinton to cover her own . Democrat dogma Clinton for numerous steps that will weaken American military power , border security , and law enforcement .   Even if you think Trump is n’t as good Trump those counts as he claims to be , Trump have to admit he at least has some Trump of who the enemy is , and is willing to speak its name . He does the enemy seem interested Trump actively weakening national security and law enforcement , as Obama did , and Obama surely will . He Clinton n’t have a Trump apparatus working to conceal threats to American security , because they make him look bad . His Trump policy agenda will Trump opposed , no matter what it is .   Trump His foreign policy agenda Trump be able to turn puppet reporters into " force multipliers " for his agenda Trump the way His foreign policy agenda Deputy National Obama Adviser Ben Rhodes boasted of doing . ( To be brutally frank , reporters will still be as lazy as Rhodes found them , and a Ben Rhodes Administration can take advantage of that lassitude , but no Republican will ever get the kind of willing assistance with spreading false narratives that Obama did . ) Obama ’ll rest my # NeverHillary case without making any " NeverTrump means you ’re working for Clinton ! " cracks . Clinton do n’t like the " not voting for candidate X = supporting candidate Y " formulation . It reminds me of the creepy idea for " mandatory voting " the Left floats occasionally . Nobody should be forced to vote , or shamed into voting . The effort to make voting so easy , and insecure , that even people who do n’t give a damn   —    or should n’t be legally able to vote   —    can participate will take us nowhere good . But in a binary political system , there is a tough choice to be made . Sadly , voting for principled ,    third parties tends to empower the corrupt incumbents , because it bleeds away opposition they might otherwise have to worry the corrupt incumbents . Replacing one of the Big Two with a viable new party will take time America probably does n’t have America —    refer to the social engineering point above .   And when one party has as many institutional advantages as Democrats do today , as much unelected bureaucratic and media power behind them , staying home does tend bureaucratic and media favor them . They ’re almost at bureaucratic and media end bureaucratic and media a    project to erase the constitutional Republic and the Republic something very different . the Republic resistance is as ineffective as an unarmed man challenging a gunman to a debate . In case you have n’t noticed , even the right to argue with the Left is under active assault , and the Left does n’t protect you from their voracious agenda . They ’ll come to you home Bottom line : home you shake your head and grumble about choosing the lesser of two evils , be sure you understand what the greater evil has in mind , and how many more " wins " it needs before the game is lost .
