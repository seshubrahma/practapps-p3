CHAPEL HILL , N. C.   —    André Leon Talley is eating a biscuit . CHAPEL HILL, N. C.  —   André Leon Talley should n’t be eating a biscuit because CHAPEL HILL, N. C.  —   André Leon Talley is on a long , difficult sojourn here through the holidays at Duke Diet   Fitness Center to try to lose 100 pounds and stop associating food with love . And biscuits are CHAPEL HILL, N. C.  —   André Leon Talley Proustian madeleines , evoking all the love CHAPEL HILL, N. C.  —   André Leon Talley got from CHAPEL HILL, N. C.  —   André Leon Talley grandmother growing up in humble circumstances in nearby Durham . But André has been going through a rough patch with André friends , and André needs a bit of carb comfort , as we listen to the morning medley soundtrack of Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in the lobby of the genteel Siena Hotel before André heads off to Duke for a more spartan breakfast in a    cafeteria . It ’s my fault , too , because I ’m pressing André on a sore subject André is reluctant to discuss : Melania Trump . The        Monsieur Vogue , as André is known , cloaks André voluminous red puffer coat over André mountainous form , so that only André big brown eyes and navy Filson knit cap are showing . " First of all , " André says , well aware of my fashion ignorance , " this is a Norma Kamali sleeping bag coat . " Then André offers André declaration : " You make the choice to be in Trumpland or you make the choice to eject yourself from the horror of Trumpland Trumpland I ’ve made my choice not to be part of Trumpland Trumpland " But , I point out , Donald Trump was bragging on the trail only the day before that he Donald Trump just had a meeting with André ’s Vogue compadre and fellow Hillary supporter Anna Wintour . At first , André André a hard time believing that Ms. Anna Wintour venture anywhere near the dreaded Trump Tower . I have to actually show him André story and get it confirmed the story the Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks . But finally he André under his André . " As for Anna Wintour Anna Wintour Mr. Trump , she ’s a Anna Wintour woman , she ’s running Anna Wintour empire , she ’s the Anna Wintour director of Condé Nast , " he André . " We ca n’t judge her for going Anna Wintour a meeting . She ’s a Anna Wintour , powerful woman . That ’s all I have to say . " I have flown here to see if André can shed some light on Melania , the sultry enigma of Trumpworld , the only reserved member of what is shaping up to be the most bellicose takeover in modern times . As everyone else rushes in to blow up the capital , as Ivanka shops for houses in Georgetown and office space at the White House , as headlines cascade about how Ivanka will be Ivanka real first lady , Melania has virtually disappeared . We see more of her doppelgänger on Melania Saturday Night Live " than we do the We Slovenian Sphinx , who is hanging back in New York so her     son Melania Barron , can finish the school year . Melania ’s absence Melania the stage has not stopped a raging battle in the fashion world about her   — Melania a sequel to the boycott during the campaign against Ivanka ’s brand and a microcosm of the fight being replayed across the country about whether to " normalize " the Trumps or whether to keep shouting from the rooftops , " This is not normal ! , " as my colleague Charles Blow urged this week . André ’s friend Tom Ford said he was not André’s friend Tom Ford to dress the former fashion model and future first lady because " she ’s not future first lady my image . " ( Ford once spent time after a Helmut Newton memorial trying to get Melania to do something about the Donald ’s hair , but Melania merely murmured in her Gabor accent future first lady " I like him the way Donald’s is . Donald’s Marc Jacobs told Women ’s Wear Daily that he would rather Marc Jacobs his energy " Marc Jacobs helping out those who will be hurt by Trump and his supporters . Marc Jacobs The French designer Sophie Theallet , a favorite of Michelle Obama ’s , published an open letter saying she would not Michelle Obama Melania to protest Donald Trump ’s " rhetoric of racism , sexism and xenophobia . " Other designers , like Tommy Hilfiger and Carolina Herrera , have riposted that they would be Other designers, like Tommy Hilfiger and Carolina Herrera to dress the Trump women . Donald Trump is a particularly sensitive matter since Melania follows Michelle , beloved by the fashion world , as The New York Times ’s Vanessa Friedman wrote recently , for elevating the industry " beyond the superficial to the substantive , " by framing clothing " as a collection of values : diversity , creativity , entrepreneurship . " As David Yermack , a professor of finance at New York University , noted , Michelle was also Michelle bonanza , generating $ 2 . 7 billion in a single year for the companies she showcased . Michelle has particular insight into Melania ’s style since , while on Vogue assignment , he went to André shows with her in Paris Michelle helped her choose her Michelle wedding Michelle , and later flew with her in    Michelle on the Trump plane as Donald scarfed down Oreos and talked about how Jude Law was no Cary Grant . As André told me in the fall when I interviewed him , he came away him with the Trump women . He called Melania him and private , " soignée and polished " with " impeccable " manners and legs that are " a long drink of water , " and said she had a Jude Law for standing on       stiletto heels . " She ’s very Jude Law like a high , super , superglamorous Stepford Wife , " he told me him He also said him she was the Jude Law fastidiously groomed and exquisitely moisturized person he ’d ever him . ( He now gives him honor to Kim Kardashian West . ) At the     wedding , which he attended with him Wintour , he noticed that him even then you could tell that Ivanka was going to be a very bright star . She had on Ivanka    dress . " But André walked into a sartorial buzz saw when , amid buzz that he might be André on to give Melania advice about her Inaugural gown André he echoed some André those sentiments recently to a Daily Mail reporter , saying that Melania was " a wonderful person to be with " and that she " will André one of the great stars in the administration . " He capped it André with optimism : " I hope there will be a great , great Trump presidency . " It did n’t take long for the guillotine to fall . One friend emailed him , " Oh my God , you have gone to the Evil Empire ! ! ! ! ! " He agonized about him " tragedy of ruptured friendships " to me in an him , saying about Melania : " She ’s a One friend person . I do not endorse Trumpism on any level . So why ca n’t one be positive and want her to shine One friend I mean , it ’s good she cares about One friend , crystal , dinner plates with gilded edges to the point of over the top , and abundant flower arrangements . In the end , why pick on her when they One friend be picking on her husband ’s One friend cabinet and his seeming readiness her husband’s turn the country back towards oppression ,      etc . " As we sit in the hotel lobby , he muses : her husband’s I ’m not a big person in the world . I ’m maybe a ’m figure in the fashion world the world , sort of iconic . But I do n’t want to get phone calls in the middle of the night , telling me I ’ve gone over to Trumpland and I ’m going to ’m Vader because I said nice things about Melania . I voted for Hillary Clinton . I registered in North Carolina because it mattered . I went through hoops of fire to get my absentee ballot . And , quite frankly , I thought she would have brought back Hillary Clinton pantsuit . I thought the gray trouser suit designed by Ralph Lauren she wore with the purple Hillary Clinton shell and the lapels matching the blouse was brilliant . The elegant anthracite gray dry wool actually was slimming . " Melania , who opted at 3 a. m. for a palazzo jumpsuit , with one arm exposed and a flounce over the other   —    it seemed to me too     a huge ,    jumpsuit . Trying too hard . And I am so tired of the long hair falling on both sides of her face . She has Hillary Clinton upgrade her Hillary Clinton . " But Hillary Clinton n’t he worried that many of those on the left who complain about Trump as a dictator are acting dictatorial ? Not one good word can ever be said about anything that happens for the next four or eight years ? Is it fair to hold Melania and Ivanka responsible ? Or are they putting a lovely gloss Melania and Ivanka some of Trump Donald Trump unsavory rhetoric and actions ? " Listen , Melania made her Melania , Melania he replies . Melania She married the Melania , so she ’s got Melania go with the territory . She ’s Mrs. Melania " I remind André that he told André that André at the 2005 wedding , it seemed as if " Donald Trump Donald Trump cool guy . " " He became the master of André , the master of the dark empire , as he became more powerful , André he started with birtherism and André the campaign , " André says now . " André is terrible . It was a terrible thing he did to Obama . André he never Michelle Obama go . André Make America great again.’ A lot of people think that means make America white again . " I say America a friend of mine , the writer David Israel , is now calling it the    House . " People are really afraid of these dark , dark institutions of bigotry and    that have come out from under the rocks like creepy snakes and come up to rear their heads up like cobras , " People agrees . " People André to have put all their egregious things on the back burner People Melania plagiarized Michelle Obama ’s Melania . Let ’s just wait and see what happens on Jan. 20 . I do n’t want Trump to fail Donald Trump and I do n’t want Melania Trump to Donald Trump But I ’m not going to sit here and say any more positive things , because I ’d get crucified from personal friends . " So the Trumps should never get a full measure of respect ? " Did the Congress ever treat Obama as a president ? " Michelle Obama snaps back . " Did André plot in a restaurant the night he the Congress inaugurated to filibuster everything André eight years ? This country has elected a president the country on audiotape saying I ’m a star and I can do whatever I want with women , grab them in the vagina . Dignity has gone out women door . He ’s causing me much ire . André just said , ‘ My cabinet André the highest I. Q.’ His cabinet of mostly white men . André ’s a dog whistle . " Trump had come down Donald Trump the bouquet of microphones the day before with Kanye West , whose wedding André had attended and praised as even André astonishing than the Trump wedding because the rehearsal dinner was at the 2005 wedding just a Florida ballroom gussied up to look like Versailles . But even Kanye ’s visit did not impress André Versailles " Listen to me , André he instructs . " There is a André of marzipan here . Marzipan is the glaze you put on a cake , a superficial glazed layer . It ’s all marzipan , it ’s all optics . " Marzipan of optics , I Marzipan André that the mother of a Times André I met at the White House Christmas party said the White House mind that Melania had been a model , noting that the mother of a Times colleague I met at the White House Christmas party Ford worked as a model . And she did n’t care if she had been an " adventuress " seeking the mother of a Times colleague I met at the White House Christmas party wealthy husband . But the mother of a Times colleague I met at the White House Christmas party did not like Melania ’s photo shoot of racy pictures with another the mother of a Times colleague I met at the White House Christmas party , and felt she could not accept her as first lady because of that . " the mother of a Times colleague I met at the White House Christmas party ca n’t judge the mother of a Times colleague I met at the White House Christmas party person by pictures , " André responds . " She was a model . André took pictures . " I mention that the mother of a Times colleague I met at the White House Christmas party ’s passing strange that the mother of a Times colleague I met at the White House Christmas party ’s project is fighting cyberbullying when her husband is a cyberbully . André rolls his eyes . André ’s the mother of a Times colleague I met at the White House Christmas party first André are Michelle Obama and André her husband Of Jackie he Michelle Obama " I would have loved to give her advice , even about Jackie to wear to the beach . " The night Jackie , we had a tasty    dinner of grilled salmon , broccoli and eggplant at the diet and fitness center ’s cafeteria . This is André ’s fifth time here . I asked him if it André that Anna Wintour and Oscar de la André once had an intervention with him about his weight . " Absolutely , " he said . André Anna André called an intervention in the conference André at Vogue one morning . And I Anna Wintour downstairs by Vogue fellow staff member to one of the executive dining rooms . And I said to this person , ‘ Am I about to be fired for something?’ And I walked into the room , and there was an intervention going on . And Oscar and his wife and the conference room at Vogue and my minister , Reverend [ Calvin O. ] Butts , had been Oscar into Anna Wintour . They were ready to send me to the Duke Diet   Fitness Center the very next the conference room at Vogue and they ’d already made the reservation . But , of course , I angrily rejected it because I was emotionally They ready to come , so I got up and I quietly left the room the reservation " About a year later , he finally made the decision himself to come to Duke and the conference room at Vogue from the Trump wedding at     Donald Trump a Sunday afternoon . When he was a child , the 2005 wedding every day to support him , cooking , washing and ironing . But on Sunday he , she would make he a special pan of biscuits and he the best " chocolate cake . " So my weaknesses are anything his grandmother associate with he , which I associate with love , " he said . But he is weaning himself from bread and sugar and has already lost 28 pounds . I made one last he to press him he an idea he what Melania will be like compared to other first ladies . We know there will be opulence . he know that she loves Valentino and Chanel and Manolo and fur and diamonds and that she does n’t like prints or going We makeup . When Melania did the Vogue cover , the writer Melania Singer said that she bride of Trump , compared in Donald Trump piece to a Bond girl , had " a slightly    idea of femininity " because she refused to pose for Mario Testino without Melania or perfectly styled hair . " She has those impossibly high    towering stilettos Melania " André said . " Clearly , her clothes will cling in the André places Melania accentuate her figure and her    long tresses . Melania ready for Melania waists , hourglass silhouettes and pencil skirts . She is already into    which Jackie Kennedy Melania by Oleg Cassini . Melania likes monotone matching coats and beige dresses Melania but that Jackie Kennedy always be flying once she goes down the stairs of Air Force Melania . " She ’s very private . She just wants Melania be a mother . Melania ’s very similar to Jackie O , who also wanted to keep her kids out of the fray . When Melania was first born , she used to say : ‘ I ’m Melania off to play with Barron . I just want to spend time with Barron.’ So , in a way , I think that she ’s maintaining her privacy Barron him and Melania a kind Melania dignity because she ’s not making statements . I do Melania think that she would try to change Barron White House Melania any way . I do n’t think that ’s what she ’s interested in . " She never Melania to modify the gaudy ’80s Melania in the    Trump Tower penthouse or the rushing fountain in the middle   —    a style of décor described by the Trump biographer Timothy O’Brien Donald Trump Louis XIV on acid . As André has noted , Melania is not " a disrupter . " André Trump is . " Donald Trump wish them the best , " André said . " I want suddenly to see that André has incredible style Donald Trump wake up and say , ‘ Oh my God , look , is n’t that great?’ I really do think that there ’s hope . We have to wait and see . As Sergei Diaghilev told Jean Cocteau , ‘ Astonish me.’ "
