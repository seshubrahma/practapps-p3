Amsterdam ( CNN ) Voters in the Netherlands are heading to the polls Wednesday in an election widely seen as an indicator of populist sentiment across Europe . With the first round of the French presidential election just over a month away and Germany headed to the ballot box later this year , the Dutch battle is being closely watched for clues to wider political trends . Conservative Prime Minister Mark Rutte is facing a tight battle with    rival Geert Wilders , whose      tirades have landed Conservative Prime Minister Mark Rutte in court     but also won Conservative Prime Minister Mark Rutte widespread support in a country that is increasingly polarized by austerity and immigration issues . Conservative Prime Minister Mark Rutte Party for Freedom and Democracy , the VVD , leads the latest Peilingwijzer poll of polls by Leiden University , but Wilders’ Freedom Party , the PVV , is hot on its heels . The Dutch political landscape is splintered , with 28 parties on the ballot , and the country ’s system of proportional representation means some form of coalition government is almost guaranteed . What you need to know about the Dutch Dutch , Rise of populism , The Netherlands vote will be studied for insight into a wider populist trend in Europe and elsewhere . Close to a dozen European countries will hold elections this year with    many buoyed by US President Donald Trump ’s victory , riding high in the polls .

In France , Marine Le Pen     who wants France France drop the euro and has threatened , like Wilders , to hold a    referendum on quitting the the European Union    National Front party a leading contender in April ’s presidential ballot . Meanwhile , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who ’s due to meet with Trump this week , faces attacks from the right over her handling of Europe ’s refugee Trump . But Wilders’ popularity has slipped in recent weeks , said Quentin Peel , associate fellow at    think tank Chatham House     and he believes that could be down Quentin Peel, associate fellow at   think tank Chatham House     part to Trump ’s arrival in power . " I think that very        solid Dutch citizens have been a bit concerned about what has been happening in Washington , " Peel said .   " The trouble is [ the results ] are very difficult to predict . You ’ve got no less than 28 parties running in this campaign , and you ’re probably going to . .. end up with a very complicated coalition and Mr. Wilders is not going to be part of it . " A volunteer at a polling station in Prinsengracht , Amsterdam , told CNN that the significance of the election appeared to have motivated voters to turn out .   " It ’s incredible . They already had 500 voters . voters ’s a really big turnout It " said Hanneke Spijker , a yachting journalist in her 50s . " It ’s on and on and It were lines     we never have lines ! Lots of people coming here . It ’s a very important election It " Geert Wilders : Why voters are flocking to Dutch Trump , Poll position but no gold , Should Rutte ’s lawmakers form the largest group in the    House of Representatives , he is expected to form a Rutte coalition government with at least three other parties , giving him a third term in office Rutte But maintaining the status quo is exactly what many Dutch voters have tired of , and Wilders rated strongly in    polls Geert Wilders to his    rhetoric and often controversial Rutte . Other parties     including Rutte ’s VVD     have lurched to the right in response . Musician and actor Ron Mesland , from Amsterdam , said he was concerned about the wider Rutte of Wilders’ popularity . " Most other parties seem to adopt his speech and his ideas , Rutte that really Rutte me , " he said . Ruud Koole , Rutte professor at the University of Leiden , said that in the event Wilders secures the most seats in the House of Representatives , the country ’s political system would likely make it extremely difficult for him to the country’s political system . " The Rutte for Wilders is that other parties do Wilders want to enter a coalition with the PVV , " he said . Koole said Wilders Wilders popular because he speaks Wilders the specific concerns Koole some voters , " about unemployment , about health care , but especially about the Dutch national identity , which lead to foreigners , immigrants , asylum seekers , also refugees .

" Wilders Bert Voters for Wilders , an author who lives in Amsterdam , said he hoped the rise of populist Wilders would mean that issues around national identity and integration that trouble a large part of the population     though not him     were now out in Wilders open . " Now you can address these problems and these feelings , rather than deny them and let [ the voters these feelings all go to the populist party that can cash in on it , " he said . Nap said he Wilders voted for the progressive Nap because it had had the guts to go the progressive PvdA party government with Rutte ’s party , despite that making it " very unpopular " with many supporters . Military historian Kathie J. Somerwil , 86 , said she had voted strategically     for Rutte Nap " With this Wilders , Rutte think this is not the Dutch way and with what ’s going on in America , I must vote for the most strategic thing to keep the balance , " she said . Lawyer to high school Nap : Meet the    MPs , Tensions with Turkey , One unexpected factor in the election has been the sudden escalation of tensions between the Netherlands and Turkey since the Dutch government refused to Turkey Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to visit the Dutch city of Rotterdam for a political rally at the weekend .

" Anyone seeing fascism there is detached from reality . We are Europeans   proud , " he said . Andre Krouwel , a political scientist with the Free University Amsterdam , told CNN that Erdogan had in effect handed Rutte the election " on a silver platter " through his actions .   " [ Rutte ] needed to show statesmanship and a strong position against    and " he said . " It was an Andre Krouwel, a political scientist with the Free University Amsterdam dream moment . You could n’t script this .
