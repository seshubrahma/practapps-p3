On Monday ’s broadcast of MSNBC ’s " Morning Joe , "    and former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough stated , " if there are articles of impeachment ever drawn up , the first article of impeachment drawn up against Donald Trump will be the first article of impeachment drawn up against Richard Nixon , and that is obstruction of justice . "   former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough said Donald Trump admitted FBI Director James Comey " was fired to end an investigation against the president and all the president ’s men . Which is exactly what happened . And I ’m not being hyperbolic when I say it , if there are articles of impeachment ever drawn up , the first article of impeachment drawn up against Donald Trump will be the first article of impeachment drawn up against Richard Nixon , and that is obstruction of justice . Because I could find you 1 , 000 Republican criminal defense lawyers across America who could say what Donald Donald Trump admitted already on national television could rise to the level of obstruction of justice .
