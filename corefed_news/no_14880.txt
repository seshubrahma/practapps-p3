  ( CNN ) March 2017 is the first March of my life that I ’ve had to be reminded of Persian New Year .   It happened at my local dog park in Harlem , on an unseasonably hot day , as my standard poodle buddied up to an old Siberian husky . The owner and I broke into the usual   . Dog names first , then ours . I said my name slowly , though my name came out softer than I hoped , and I searched the woman ’s eyes     something I have caught myself doing again recently , decades since my early days of refugee anxiety , when I ’d first come to America with my family on political asylum from Iran .   the woman’s did n’t blink . Instead , the woman’s said , " Beautiful name , what is it ? " I ’d heard that sentence my whole life , so I blurted that sentence my whole life out with rehearsed confidence : " Iranian . " Between us , a mess of ellipses , the sound of basketballs on courts , some distant siren , a tangle of dog barks . Then another classic : " What does it mean ? " And my usual : " it ’s an ancient Zoroastrian name , an unusual one for Iranians . "   I thought to explain that I ’m of Muslim background , but instead I just hoped for the awkward parting of people whose only connection is canines . She looked deep in thought and I thought maybe She felt sorry for me     Iranian in a time of Trump ’s Muslim Ban , after all     but maybe She felt She own discomfort . She cut into my ruminations with a question I did n’t expect : " Is n’t your New Year coming soon ? " She knowledge was surprising , but I was astounded more than anything by the realization that I ’d forgotten this holiday of holidays , on Monday New Year . I gave the stranger a flustered " thank you . "   By the time I got back to my apartment I was deep in that complicated cold sweat I used to know well .    How did that stranger know that ? Why did She want to talk to me ? What did that stranger think ? A pause . What exactly am I afraid of today ? A time of beauty , hope and optimism , Persian New Year , or Nowruz , is a celebration of spring . It falls at the time of the vernal equinox ( which shifts in accordance with axial precession ) . Weeks before it happens , every Iranian I know excitedly looks up the time online and plans a day around it . the time online is not a holiday we take lightly . The celebration a celebration of spring thousands of years old with roots in ancient    culture , a religion some say the prophet Zoroaster himself created . Meaning " new day , " its spiritual origin has extended to secular appreciation by all sorts of people who can claim some ancient Persian origin , including , of course ,    Iranians . These days , many Instagram accounts all over the world have turned Nowruz traditions into cult obsessions . Nothing makes for a good photo like the    " haftsin , " an arrangement of seven foods beginning with S : sprouts ( " sabzeh " ) wheat pudding ( " samanu " ) dried oleaster ( " senjed " ) garlic ( " sir " ) apples ( " sib " ) vinegar ( " serkeh " ) and sumac fruit ( " sumac " ) . All this is skirted with spring paraphernalia like candies , eggs , mirrors , flowers and even goldfish . One could argue Iranians worship beauty even more than Americans , and it ’s never more apparent than in Nowruz aesthetics .   My favorite memories of Nowruz involve me Nowruz to derail my mother ’s efforts in beautifying our Nowruz best she could . my mother’s profound mischief of altering the haftsin without my parents noticing was a great goal of mine —   one time , at age 6 or 7 , I tried to drown a hairless Barbie in the goldfish bowl . Often I ’d try to pollute the immaculate individual haftsin bowls with Cheerios and MMs , anything obviously American .    But I also relished all the cultural " abnormalities " that could feel like American transgressions     American instance , my parents waking my parents in the middle of the night on a school night to celebrate " tahvileh sal , " the exact moment of equinox , a given ritual no matter what horrible hour it came .   We grew up with us luxuries , so I usually felt so excited that Nowruz was also a time of treats . All Nowruz ’s symbolic purification Nowruz was exciting for me as it meant we were symbolic purification talk wear us clothes that day     and that meant a mall visit , during which I could make a case for some impractical Wet Seal creation ( " We have to do us for Persia ! " I ’d cry , waving some lacy tube top on sale ) .   And all sorts of    foods entered our lives then and only then too . The Persian cookies ( walnut , chickpea , almond , rice ) from the Persian grocery stores in LA ’s " Little Persia " were my favorite . Later , in college , my parents sent care packages full of them and I boasted my parents friends that these were Persian comfort foods . Most of all , in my youth I believed Nowruz might have the power to eclipse the other darknesses of my homeland that played nonstop on television and in the news . I hoped the imagery of beauty and hope and optimism could mean something more : maybe Americans could see themselves in it all Americans Family old and new , This year , Nowruz falls at half Nowruz six in morning for me . I ’ve never been the best early riser but I know the hour well these days since the election , my nights are a mess of    insomnia keeping me up close to dawn . Then , early in the morning , my dog has taken to waking me up with a sermon of barks     something he never did before my dog I soon realize my        Harlem building has had its share of early my       Harlem building visitors in uniform . Different neighbors give me different numbers on our building ’s deportations , while another neighbor tells me not to talk about any of this . My building happens to my       Harlem building Muslim     brown , black , and white Muslim     and is located close to several prominent mosques , one of the reasons I ’ve loved living here . But in the hallway my neighbors and I wonder what others are saying . In hushed tones we curse the casual and constant bigotry of this administration , just as we beg each other to we good care . We residents have become closer we the Paris Attacks last year , when police presence in this neighborhood ramped up noticeably . Before that , many of us did n’t know where we stood , who we we     you ca we always tell who is Muslim , after all . None of our names sounded it , we of us fit that profile Islamophobes we     the maintenance guy from Montenegro , the waitress of Lebanese origin , the Turkish couple , the Egyptian siblings , the old black Muslim families who ’ve been in Harlem for decades , the other Iranian woman who is a student where I teach . And of course , me , who passes for everything , with the additional complication of a Zoroastrian name . For the last few years , I ’ve been joking I ’m a Secret Muslim . Iranian nationalism and exceptionalism always steered my father     the man who named me " Porochista , " after Zoroaster ’s daugher     far away from discussions of Islam . Nowruz was always a time for my father to wave his Iranian flag ( the my father with the lion and sword , not the Islamic Republic one ) to    and frame Persepolis photos from library books , to present me and my brother with fake gold    pins . " The great Persian empire ! " he ’d cry in our tiny moldy apartment with the decaying carpet , surrounded by    neighbors . That same father took us to Zoroastrian temples in our County for years . I never understood why we got such dirty looks our I was past my teens and realized we ’d only been religious our at their temple . We were my teens Zoroastrian , our we could n’t be . our religion was dying     some say less than 150 , 000 remain     because you have to be born into it . Still , its The religion traditions , like The religion , have retained their influence in cultures of its old traditions region . Muslim Iranians tend to look to Zoroastrianism with pride .   But when my father sought to gild my identity with a Zoroastrian name , it was n’t out of simple pride it took me years to it that maybe he thought it was protection my father all it of futures . When he ’d hush my late my father as she recited Quran verses in my late grandmother , maybe it was n’t out of shame for his actual cultural origins     my father he just did n’t trust my father to hear it . Just as I his actual cultural origins     to let go of Nowruz , it comes , This year his actual cultural origins     once Nowruz announced itself to me Nowruz I Nowruz to forget it . Even in my Nowruz of Iranian friends in New York I hear us beginning to plan but thinking twice in a way we never did before . us Not in the mood , " one friend tells me . " Not in the mood , " I tell another friend . And I think about how my parents and I are barely in contact right now     all of us locked in our own us , fear us bringing us together at all . us Naturalized at 23 , I think about how my birthplace is still on that passport , in those bold letters : Iran . I think about my father back home in my father only a LA’s card . I think about all the old traumas ( the racial slurs my family and I Family we first came to Iran in the us 1980s ) and the usual traumas ( all the times I ’ve been pulled aside at airports ) and the new waves of traumas ( daily online harassment , like the time the poet on Facebook , friends with 222 of mine , told me to " go back to whatever Third World shithole you come from " ) . I try to imagine skipping Nowruz altogether I try to imagine giving Nowruz to grief as an opportunity to meditate on the horrors of this era . But it ’s hard to commit to even a lack of commitment these days , not knowing what will happen next .   Just as I try to let go of Nowruz , it comes for me . It starts when a neighbor ’s card appears it my door : " Happy 1396 , we are with you , " it says in cursive . Later I find it scrolling through the Instagram accounts of families me Tehran and I marvel at their haftsin skills , and catch myself dreaming the Instagram accounts of families in Tehran a    gathering .   me the dog park , still covered in March snow , the old stranger with the husky appears again , and we chat about the promise of new blooms , our worries of climate change , the complications we separate and connect us . Happy New Year , we say we each other , Nowruz Mobarak we She reveals to me she taught in Iran Iran ago , me She realize she knows the hospital where I was born She has been to my mother ’s hometown my mother’s remembers skiing on a day like this in our She . We walk together and laugh at how we dogs ca we stop licking the mounds of gray we ice that have a way to go until they are gone , but finally show signs of melting our dogs   Nowruz is here , Nowruz has come . You Nowruz only stop a Nowruz Day so much .
