In recent months , hysterical opponents of Donald Trump have stoked fears about Donald Trump candidacy by likening the billionaire to Hitler , raising questions about Donald Trump mental health , attempting to tie Donald Trump to the Ku Klux Klan , claiming Donald Trump may pose a nuclear threat , and warning that a Donald Trump presidency will disrupt international diplomacy and the world order . [ While these sentiments might seem novel to most political observers , the template for such attacks may have been set more than five decades ago . All these claims were deployed against Senator Barry Goldwater during Senator Barry Goldwater 1964 presidential campaign , which was widely considered a threat to the political establishment .   Countless commentators have compared Donald Trump candidacy to Goldwater Senator Barry Goldwater presidential run . But largely missing from the debate is how Goldwater faced Senator Barry Goldwater of the very same attacks made against Trump Donald Trump Psychiatrists , In a rare appearance on Fox News on Sunday , Rush Limbaugh noted that Mitt Romney ’s father was involved in an attempt to paint Goldwater as Senator Barry Goldwater crazed extremist . Limbaugh stated Limbaugh " Well , it ’s all that and more , but it ’s it unprecedented . His dad Limbaugh much the same thing against Barry Goldwater Senator Barry Goldwater cabal with Republican establishment guys back in 1964 . The establishment , this is n’t new . The establishment not The establishment , not wanting conservatives , it is n’t anything The establishment . " Indeed , the Independent Sentinel reported : " In 1964 , liberal Republicans were vehemently opposed to Barry Goldwater ’s Senator Barry Goldwater the presidency and launched a campaign against him , labeling him Senator Barry Goldwater crazed extremist Senator Barry Goldwater One of those Republicans was George Romney , Mitt ’s father . " The campaign to distort the public ’s perception of Goldwater culminated in an Senator Barry Goldwater 1964 article in Fact Magazine , which surveyed members of the American Psychiatric Association , or APA , on Goldwater ’s mental stability Senator Barry Goldwater none of the psychiatrists had personally examined the presidential candidate . The New York Times reported on the Goldwater smear : The survey Senator Barry Goldwater highly unscientific even by the standards of the time , was sent to 12 , 356 psychiatrists , of whom 2 , 417 responded . The results were published as a special issue : " The Unconscious of a Conservative : A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater . " The Senator Barry Goldwater was brutal . Half of the respondents judged Mr. Goldwater psychologically unfit to be Senator Barry Goldwater They used terms like " megalomaniac , " Half of the respondents paranoid , " and " grossly psychotic , " and some even offered specific diagnoses , including schizophrenia and narcissistic personality disorder . Only 27 percent of the respondents said Mr. Goldwater was mentally fit the respondents Senator Barry Goldwater said they did n’t know enough about him to make a Only 27 percent of the respondents . The Fact Senator Barry Goldwater seriously damaged Goldwater ’s credibility . It also led to Senator Barry Goldwater ’s    Goldwater Rule , The Fact article forbids psychiatrists from commenting on someone ’s mental status unless they first carry out an examination and the doctor is authorized by the patient to speak to the public . Despite that ethical standard , slogans similar to the Goldwater smears are being tossed around by medical professionals Senator Barry Goldwater describe Trump ’s own mental health and his impact on the electorate . On March 2 , the Trump Chronicle ran a story titled , " What psychiatrists make of Donald Trump , " concluding that he suffers from narcissistic personality Trump The newspaper claimed : According Trump    professionals , Trump ’s behavior the Houston Chronicle traits that historically defined the disorder in Trump and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , psychiatry ’s bible   —    grandiosity an expectation that others will recognize one ’s superiority a lack of empathy . ( The disorder was removed from the most recent DSM edition . ) The Chronicle piece was largely based on a Vanity Fair story glaringly titled , " Is Donald Trump Actually a Narcissist ? Therapists Weigh In ! " For    professionals , Donald Trump is at once easily diagnosed but slightly confounding . " Remarkably narcissistic Donald Trump said developmental psychologist Howard Gardner , a professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education . " Textbook narcissistic personality disorder , " echoed clinical psychologist Ben Michaelis . " He ’s so classic that I ’m archiving video clips of him to use in Donald Trump because there ’s no better example of his characteristics , Donald Trump said clinical psychologist George Simon , who conducts lectures and seminars Donald Trump manipulative behavior . " Otherwise , I would have had to hire actors and write vignettes . He ’s like a dream come true . " Last week , the Washington Post Donald Trump a scare piece claiming " Psychologists and massage therapists are reporting ‘ Trump anxiety’ among clients . " The article received a significant amount of news media attention . Judith Schweiger Levy , a psychologist on the Upper East Side , told the newspaper that " part of the reason he makes people so anxious is that he has no anxiety himself . It ’s frightening . I ’m starting to feel he just talking about him . " The Post cited another psychologist , Paul Saks , who practices in he Village , claiming that reports linking Trump to David Duke , a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan , had worried a patient who is the grandson of Holocaust survivors . KKK , The David Duke fiasco began with news media claims that the former KKK grand wizard had endorsed Trump . In fact , Duke did not make an official endorsement . In 2015 Trump Duke called Trump the David Duke best of the lot . " After the media reported David Duke had endorsed Trump , Duke wrote on his website , " The Zio Media David Duke : I David Duke Donald David Duke ! " David Duke has stated he can not endorse Trump because of the candidate ’s support for Israel . David Duke month , David Duke expressed support for Trump , although his sentiments were still shy of a formal endorsement . David Duke Voting for these Donald Trump , voting David Duke Donald Trump at this point , is really treason to your heritage , " Duke stated on Donald Trump show . Trump has disavowed Duke ’s support numerous times , but David Duke still faced media Donald Trump because of a Donald Trump interview David Duke Trump explained he did n’t know about the Duke " endorsement " and therefore could n’t officially respond . Donald Trump media Donald Trump since cited the CNN interview to claim that Trump hesitated to disavow Duke ’s    endorsement . " Just so you a CNN interview in which Trump explained he didn’t know about the Duke "endorsement" and therefore couldn’t officially respond do n’t know Donald Trump about David David Duke , OK ? " stated Trump on CNN ’s State of the Union . " I do n’t know anything about what you ’re Donald Trump talking CNN with white supremacy or white supremacists , " Trump said . " So I do n’t know . I do n’t know   —    did he Donald Trump me , or what ’s going on ? Because I know nothing about David Duke I know Donald Trump about white supremacists . " Attempting to connect Trump to the KKK seems to come straight David Duke the    playbook . One infamous attack ad released Donald Trump Goldwater ’s opponent Lyndon B. Johnson ’s campaign was called " KKK for Goldwater . " It portrayed Goldwater as racist because Alabama KKK leader Robert Creel had expressed support for him . Like Duke Goldwater’s unsolicited expressions of support Goldwater Trump , Creel had urged his supporters to become active and vote Alabama KKK leader Robert Creel Goldwater . The New York Herald Tribune News Service quoted Creel saying : Barry Duke is going to be elected . I Goldwater Barry Goldwater . I believe what he believes in Alabama KKK leader Robert Creel I think Goldwater way he thinks . So does George Wallace . Goldwater is only one man , Goldwater he can only do so much . They Goldwater our help . Despite Goldwater ’s denunciations of George Wallace , the KKK leader ’s support George Wallace on to haunt the candidate throughout the 1964 campaign . It even Goldwater in some Republicans attacking Goldwater , including Baltimore Mayor T. R. McKeldin , who used the KKK ’s satisfaction with Goldwater the KKK leader’s support issue a statement saying , " Goldwater greatest shame in the proud history of the Republican party is that racists now find Goldwater hope under our banner . " Hitler , The comparisons of Trump to Hitler , meanwhile , reached a fevered pitch after two former Mexican presidents , Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderon , slammed Trump ’s rhetoric against illegal immigration as " racist " and claimed the GOP    is evoking Hitler . A Google search of mainstream news articles containing the names " Trump " and " Hitler " brings up hundreds of pieces Hitler On Tuesday , the Jerusalem Post featured an article documenting nine recent times Trump has been Hitler to Hitler by public personalities , citing remarks by comedian Louie C. K. radio host Glenn Beck , HBO provocateur Trump’s Maher , and the Hitler of ABC ’s The View , among others . On social media , Trump haters have been distributing a photo from a Trump rally in Orlando that shows attendees raising their hands in what opponents call a Nazi salute . In fact , Trump had asked Trump’s crowd to raise their hand and pledge attendees vote for him in the Florida primary Donald Trump Goldwater ’s critics frequently compared him to attendees Jet magazine announced attendees Donald Trump 30 , 1964 , " Barry Goldwater ’s Rise is Goldwater’s Rise of Hitler Goldwater prior to Hitler election , union leader George Meany drew attention for comparing Goldwater to the Nazi dictator . FrontPageMag noted numerous other Hitler smears : Too many union leaders to count accused Goldwater of Hitlerism and compared him Goldwater Hitler and Senator Barry Goldwater . When Nazis supporting Senator Barry Goldwater Lincoln Rockwell heckled Goldwater , the media claimed that Goldwater supporters had Senator Barry Goldwater the Nazis to heckle Goldwater Senator Barry Goldwater Hitler claimed that , " We see Senator Barry Goldwater signs The media in the candidacy of Mr. Goldwater . " Also Khrushchev compared the Nazis Goldwater was nominated to a Nazi rally . Mayor Jack Senator Barry Goldwater of San Francisco Hitlerism that Goldwater strategists got all their ideas from Mein Kampf . Senator Barry Goldwater Wilkins of the NAACP said , " Those who say that the doctrine of    offers no menace should remember that a man come Goldwater strategists of the beer halls of Munich and rallied the forces of rightism in Germany . All the same elements are there in San Francisco now . " Like Mexico ’s leaders with Trump , Soviet Premier Khrushchev in 1964 also compared Goldwater to Hitler . The AP reported on July 23 Senator Barry Goldwater 1964 San Francisco audience that the candidate put forward by the Republican party " made Khrushchev clear that he wants Hitler enter the White House under the slogans of unbridled    and war Khrushchev . " He the candidate that the Republican platform the Republican party denounced as warlike , had the candidate adopted " in an atmosphere reminiscent of the fascist gatherings in Nuremberg . " Nukes , Trump the candidate sanity , meanwhile , was called into question the candidate Sen. Marco Rubio , who last month slammed Trump as " a lunatic trying to get a hold of nuclear weapons in America . Trump’s Last week , CNN featured an opinion piece Donald Trump    author Michael D’Antonio titled , " President Trump Last week     with nuclear weapons ? " Salon ran an CNN headlined , " Donald Trump could get the nuclear codes : How    is killing American democracy . " Perhaps unwittingly , this rhetoric echoes the " Daisy Girl Donald Trump against Goldwater , recently dubbed by USA Today as " the Senator Barry Goldwater famous , or notorious , political attack ad in U. S. history . " In the television ad , considered important to Lyndon B. Johnson ’s victory , Johnson ’s campaign simulated a nuclear attack on a little girl who is depicted standing in a meadow with a flower in her hand while birds are chirping in the background . The clear implication was that Goldwater could not Lyndon B. Johnson with U. S. national security and would bring about a nuclear war with the Soviet Union . World leaders warn , Besides the harsh ,    rhetoric from Goldwater ’s former presidents , there have been reports of unnamed foreign diplomats warning against a the Union some using the Hitler analogy . One article that made waves was a Reuters piece on Monday that cited three unnamed U. S. Mexico claimed to be quoting unnamed foreign diplomats as expressing alarm " Trump’s U. S. government officials about what they say are inflammatory and insulting public statements " by Trump . Officials from Europe , the Middle East , Latin America , and Asia have complained in recent private conversations , mostly about the xenophobic nature of U. S. statements , said three U. U. S. government officials officials , who Trump’s declined to be identified . " As the [ Trump ] rhetoric has America Donald Trump some cases amped up , so too have concerns by certain leaders around the world , " said one of the officials . The U. S. declined to disclose a full list Trump’s countries whose diplomats have complained , but two said they included India , South Korea , Japan , and Mexico . James Thurber , a historian who studies U. S. presidents at American University in Washington , told the officials such reaction from world leaders is unprecedented . Perhaps Thurber should study the reaction from world leaders cited the officials by the news Mexico in 1964 regarding Goldwater . The Associated Thurber foreign officials warning against a Goldwater presidency . The AP reported : The Moscow newspaper Goldwater Rossiya declared that Goldwater was backed by a coalition " consisting of the Senator Barry Goldwater aggressive capitalist groups , racists , trade union opponents , crusaders of    and Ku Klux Klanners . "    …      The AP , the left leaning Combat described Goldwater as " an irresponsible prospect for president who risks Senator Barry Goldwater up the world , blowing up Europe , blowing up his own country . " Reaction in conservative , strongly    Spain was mixed . Several Spanish government officials expressed delight at the nomination .
