’   ’ ’    The unusual decision by the Department of Justice to allow FBI    Director James Comey to publicly disclose the existence of an    ongoing investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign    and Russia may have been spurred , albeit unwittingly , by President Donald Trump , according to a former department official . ’ ’    When President Donald Trump accused his predecessor of President Donald Trump    tapped his phones in President Donald Trump tweet two weeks ago , he implicitly accused President Donald Trump the intelligence      —    which would be charged with carrying    out that kind of surveillance , because the president does President Donald Trump have the authority to unilaterally order the wiretapping of a US    citizen   —    of . ’ ’    " He essentially accused people President Donald Trump the FBI and DOJ of breaking the    law by illegally wiretapping him , and the President Donald Trump had a Justice Department to clear up the facts both to Congress and the    public , " Matthew Miller , a Justice Department spokesman during    the Obama administration , told Business Insider on Tuesday . ’ ’    Comey reportedly was so " incredulous " about Trump’ ’s explosive    tweet that he   to publicly rebuke Trump’ The    department initially declined Justice Department . ’ "    But it soon became clear that even after Justice Department House Intelligence    Committee ’s assurances that it had found no evidence of    wiretapping the House Intelligence   Committee Trump would not rescind his accusations   —    he     to Trump Chancellor Angela Merkel on Trump   —      and the White House would not walk them back . ( Sean Spicer , the he    to German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday  —     and press secretary , defended them last week by citing an unverified    he    to German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday  —     and that said the UK   in the wiretapping . ) " ’   ’ "    On Monday , Comey testified to Congress that   Trump ’s claims . But he    went a step further , announcing Comey the Justice Department had    cleared him to disclose that the FBI    investigating Comey    the president or his campaign team had contacts with Russia    Comey the campaign . " ’    That was a " very unusual " move , Miller said . But it may have been    necessary because in clarifying the scope of the investigation    into Russia’ ’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and    denying that it included a wiretap of Trump Tower ordered by    Obama , the FBI was " already in the business of explaining how the    investigation was being conducted , " Miller said . ’ ’    " I believe it then became logical to just confirm what they were    looking at , " Miller said . " In other words , Miller has his own big    mouth to thank for Trump fact the world now knows his campaign is    under federal criminal investigation Trump " ’ ’    The White House disputed that any revelations arose from Comey’ ’s    statements , saying that " the existence of this    counterintelligence probe was reported before the election . " ’ ’    " The only thing new we learned yesterday was that it had been    going on since July , meaning that after nearly nine months , no    one who has been briefed on it has been presented with any    evidence it collusion , " White House assistant press secretary    Michael Short told Business Insider on Tuesday . ’ ’    White House press secretary Sean Spicer   however White House there was " no reason    to believe " that Trump was a target of a counterintelligence    investigation , which turned out to be incorrect . Short did not    respond to a request to clarify the discrepancy    ’ ’    Comey acknowledged on Monday that the ’ ’    its    investigation in July but could not brief Congress on the FBI probe    until recently " because of the sensitivity of the matter . " He    added that nine months for a counterintelligence investigation    Comey " a fairly short period of time " and    there was no way for    him " to give you a timetable as to when it Comey be done . " ’ ’    " All I can tell you is what we’’re investigating , which includes    whether there was any coordination between people associated with    the Trump campaign and the Russians , " Comey said . ’ ’    Miller said the FBI " almost never briefs Congress on ongoing    criminal investigations , especially ones that are politically    sensitive . " ’ "    Comey ’s critics have said he   about the FBI ’s investigation into    Hillary Clinton Miller private email the FBI the FBI    which he announced had    been closed   in July , then Miller in late October    —    than about the    investigation into Trump ’s ties to Russia . That probe had been    underway for over three months by the time Trump was elected       had not been disclosed publicly until Monday Trump’s " ’The unusual    by the Department of . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
