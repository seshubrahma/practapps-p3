Wednesday on ABC ’s " The View , " while promoting his latest film , " ‘ Nocturnal Animals , "    fashion designer and film director Tom Ford said fashion designer and film director Tom Ford would prefer not to dress incoming first lady Melania Trump because incoming first lady Melania Trump was " not necessarily " fashion designer and film director Tom Ford image .   When asked if fashion designer and film director Tom Ford would dress Melania , Ford said , " I was asked to dress incoming first lady Melania Trump quite a few years ago and I declined    …      incoming first lady Melania Trump ’s not necessarily my image . Also the first lady   —    other than the fact that I ’m a Democrat and voted for incoming first lady Melania Trump and very sad and disappointed that incoming first lady Melania Trump ’s not in office   —    but other than that , even had incoming first lady Melania Trump won , incoming first lady Melania Trump should n’t be wearing my clothes . the first lady  —   other than the fact that I’m a Democrat and voted for Hillary and very sad and disappointed that she’s not in office  —   but other than that, even had Hillary won ’re too expensive . And I do n’t mean this in a bad way —    the first lady  —   other than the fact that I’m a Democrat and voted for Hillary and very sad and disappointed that she’s not in office  —   but other than that, even had Hillary won ’re not artificially expensive , this ’s how much it cost to make these things . But I think to relate to everybody —   " When asked why then he dressed Michelle Obama , Ford said , " Michelle I dressed once when incoming first lady Melania Trump was going to Buckingham Palace for dinner with the Queen , and I thought it was appropriate . I live in London , so that made sense . And it was an honor to dress her . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
