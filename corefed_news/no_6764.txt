Dr. Sebastian Gorka , deputy adviser to President Donald Trump and former National Security editor for Breitbart News , discussed the London terror attack with SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Thursday ’s Breitbart News Daily . [ " We need to note that for jihadists , dates are very important :       was the anniversary of a great defeat against jihadi fighters centuries ago . The fact that this happened on the anniversary of the Brussels attack really should not have surprised anybody , " Gorka said .    " the Brussels attack should n’t have come out of the blue , " Gorka continued Gorka referring to Kassam ’s earlier mention of the    decapitation of British soldier Lee Rigby , in which a vehicle was also used as a weapon . He also Gorka the " knife intifada " of random stabbings conducted by Palestinians against Israelis and the truck attack in Nice , France . " These are n’t things that are coming out of the blue sky . These are These that are being propagated and promoted by ISIS . This is how they think These They ’re These interested in investing millions of dollars and time and energy and expertise in weapons of mass destruction . They ’re These       —    whether it ’s      — a truck in France and plowing into almost 90 people , whether it ’s      — a knife and slashing people on the streets of Tel Aviv or Jerusalem . This is their new These operandi . It costs This , and it is This , " he said . Gorka said jihadis would continue to exploit the Western world ’s vulnerability to these cheap and deadly truck and knife attacks until " the chattering classes think that they should jihadis vehicles the same way banning guns will make us safe . " " This is the beauty of this attack : it ’s This about the everyday item , the inanimate object . It ’s This the person driving it or using it . it ’s why good counterterrorism is n’t reactive it is good counterterrorism , " Gorka argued . " That ’s why you have to find these people , use human intelligence . Here in the United States , we ’ve taken the step of our travel we to stop people coming from war zones who want to use these kinds of tactics against us . we there will be the focus on all kinds of diversionary issues , not the fact that this individual was already on the radar screen of the security services a year ago . " Gorka said there has " never been a case of an upstanding citizen or immigrant on Monday deciding on Tuesday to become a jihadi and killing his fellow citizens . " " There ’s always a progression . There ’s always a digestion of jihadi ideology . There ’s always some kind of statement of sympathy for the things that the bad guys are doing . That ’s how we find them . the bad guys ’s how we prevent we next attack , " he declared his Kassam argued that    empathy for terrorists as oppressed people striking back against unfair foreign policy , economic deprivation , or religious discrimination nourishes the sense of grievance that fuels extremism . He also his that Islamic leaders like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have a habit of describing refugees and immigrants as an army ready to rise up against evil Europe , which is at odds with the Left ’s insistence that refugees are harmless in any quantity , from any point of origin . Gorka responded with a favorite quote : " On the Left , reality is optional . " " This is n’t about objective truth . It ’s This been about narrative , " he elaborated Gorka " For the last eight years , unfortunately , out of the White House , they ’ve the White House spinning this narrative . " " We ’ve the White House to be super careful because if we do the White House understand why this attack happened , we truly the White House become inured to these events , " he warned Gorka " People will die , and then 24 hours later , we ’re the White House to go back to business as usual . "   " The bottom line is this does n’t happen because of grievances . This does n’t happen because of unemployment or   . It happens This evil walks the earth . The Left will deny that . Their multiculturalism The Left their    The Left , denies the existence of evil . That ’s why they were Their multiculturalism, their   relativism to fight this threat , " he said This In contrast , Gorka said the Trump administration " understands people like yesterday ’s attacker , the    bombers , Fort Hood , San Bernardino are a product of incarnate evil , " adding , " And we will defeat it , Raheem .
