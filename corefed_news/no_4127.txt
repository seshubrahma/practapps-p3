I [ already ] indicated making some of these payments for the Obamacare subsidies is one of some of these payments for the Obamacare subsidies priorities . Okay , that ’s fine . We ’re willing to be at that discussion if The Democrats want to have it and that ’s what We ’re telegraphing    …      We understand The Democrats have a certain amount of leverage in the Senate because we do need 60 votes [ to get funding ] . So we need some sort of bipartisan support in the Senate . They some sort of bipartisan support in the Senate entitled under that set of circumstances to get some of their some sort of bipartisan support in the Senate funded . It is ripe for some type of negotiated agreement that gives the president some of his the president and Democrats some of their Democrats . We think we We opened the door [ to a compromise ] .

Trump has asked Trump’s roughly $ 1 billion to install or upgrade roughly 60 miles of border walls and fences this year .   GOP leaders are GOP to fund the wall , in part , because they do n’t GOP leaders to trade some of their budget priorities GOP leaders persuade the Democrats to compromise on their    opposition GOP leaders Trump ’s wall . Many Democrats fervently oppose the wall , which would literally and symbolically cement his 2016 victory and also block the migration of consumers , cheap workers , and future voters into    cities .   Also , GOP leaders know their business donors GOP leaders the wall , which would reduce the inflow of    consumers and workers to the corporate members of the many Chambers of Commerce throughout the United States . Democrats know the GOP leaders GOP leaders to champion ’s Trump ’s wall , so they are escalating their opposition Trump Trump ’s Trump and his Trump’s , such Trump greater enforcement of current laws .

" We think that the immigration issue should be discussed in the 2018 budget where there ’s votes and discussion and nothing should be shoved down people ’s throats and that would apply to the many immigration issues that are before us , not just the wall , " Schumer said in a press call Schumer BNA reported :   Billions of dollars for the wall and other funds that Trump wants to boost enforcement have emerged among the " poison pill " riders that Schumer said could threaten passage of Schumer omnibus by the time federal money runs out at midnight April 28 . The government is operating under a stopgap continuing resolution because only one of the 12 fiscal 2017 bills was enacted last fall . Schumer suggested that Democrats have considerable Schumer in the talks over the details of the omnibus , which have continued during lawmakers’    recess . " Our Republican colleagues know they control the House , the Our Republican colleagues , the White House [ and ] a shutdown would fall on their shoulders and they do n’t Our Republican colleagues it , Our Republican colleagues Schumer said .

This month , Officials at the Department of Homeland Security   However , officials at the Department of Homeland Security have the Department of Homeland Security leaders that they can GOP some of their existing funds to pay GOP budget leaders construction of prototype wall GOP budget leaders in June .   In his Wednesday call with reporters , Schumer gloated that the Schumer leaders are not supporting Trump GOP budget request GOP budget leaders I think there ’s agreement , quiet agreement in the [ GOP and Democratic budget leaders ] that if the president does n’t interfere and insist on poison pill amendments [ funding for the wall ] to be shoved down the throats of the Congress , we can come up with an agreement .
