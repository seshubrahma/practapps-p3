  The list of Emmy winners | red carpet looks | our critic ’s review of the show ] LOS ANGELES   —    It was business as usual in the two major categories at the Emmys on Sunday night , as HBO ’s " Game of Thrones " and " Veep " repeated as winners for best drama and comedy . But for a ceremony that can be numbingly predictable , the Emmys were energized by a slew of    winners in the acting categories and a tour de force in the limited series category by FX ’s " The People v. O. J. Simpson : American Crime Story . " The success of the O. J. series set the theme for the evening as Sarah Paulson , Courtney B. Vance and Sterling K. Brown all scored their first Emmy victories . Rami Malek won his Rami Malek Emmy as well in a    race for best actor in a drama , for his Rami Malek as the tortured hacker in USA ’s " Mr. Robot . " And in a big upset , Tatiana Maslany won as best actress in a drama for her Tatiana Maslany performances in BBC America ’s " Orphan Black , " beating out the likes of Robin Wright , Claire Danes and last year ’s winner , Viola Davis . Kate McKinnon of " Saturday Night Live " provided a change of pace , too , upsetting Allison Janney , a    Emmy winner , as best supporting actress for comedy . Likewise , Louie Anderson won his Louie Anderson Emmy in the best supporting comedy category for his Louie Anderson as a suburban mother in FX ’s " Baskets . " There was a changing of the guard in the variety category , as John Oliver ’s show , " Last Week Tonight , " ended the    run of Comedy Central victories . There were familiar winners as well : In the comedy category , Julia    won her Julia    consecutive best actress award for her Julia    on " Veep , " and Jeffrey Tambor , for the second year in a row , won for his role as a transgender woman in " Transparent . " This was the second consecutive year that " Game of Thrones " and " Veep " took top honors , which helped propel HBO to six Emmys on Sunday night and 22 Emmys over all ( some categories were awarded previously ) the biggest haul of any programmer . FX was right behind with 18 wins , including six on Sunday . " Thrones " once again led all shows with 12 wins , including three on Sunday Sunday but there is some good news for HBO HBO in the drama category : Next year " Game of Thrones , " one of TV ’s most widely praised dramas , will not be eligible for the Emmys the network elected to start the show ’s seventh season in the summer 2017 , outside of the    window . In a sign of the expected Emmys dominance for " Game of Thrones " and " O. J , " Jimmy Kimmel , the show ’s host , said in his opening O. J , " If your show does n’t have a dragon or a white Bronco in it , go home . " Here are some of the themes and highlights of the evening : Comedy Central had a chokehold on the variety talk show category for years , and a Comedy Central Comedy Central the award on Sunday : Mr. Oliver , for his HBO show , " Last Week Tonight . " The show is his HBO show its third season , his HBO show the win represents a breakthrough of sorts . The Emmy in this category has been handed out to daily talk shows for years and has n’t been given to a weekly show since Tracey Ullman won for her sketch series " Tracey Ullman Takes On   …     " nearly 20 years ago . ( Starting last year , variety sketch series and variety talk series were separated into different categories . ) Mr. Oliver ’s triumph is a blow for Comedy Central , which had won this award for 13 consecutive years between " The Daily Show " and " The Colbert Report . " Not this year Trevor Noah , Jon Stewart ’s replacement , was shut out of the race and not nominated in his first year as Jon Stewart’s of " The Daily Show . " But there was some solace in Comedy Central ’s night , when " Key   Peele " won the best variety sketch series award . The bad news ? That is now off the air . Not surprisingly , this year ’s divisive Not this year a significant role in this year ’s ceremony . Not this year possibility of a Donald J. Trump presidency , Mr. Kimmel lit into the reality show producer Mark Burnett , who was one of the creators of NBC ’s " The Apprentice , " the show that made Mr. Trump a nationwide television star a Donald J. Trump ABC ’s camera firmly squared on Mr. Burnett   —    who laughed the entire time , despite the charged barbs   —    Mr. Kimmel said that if Mr. Trump Mr. Kimmel president , Mr. a Donald J. Trump the man to blame . " Mr. Burnett   ’s elected and he builds that wall , the Mr. Burnett   person we ’re Mr. Burnett   over it is Mark Burnett , " Mr. Kimmel said . that wall in Mr. Burnett   , Mr. Kimmel The Voice " won the best reality show , Mr. Burnett , a producer for that show as well , shot back at Mr. Kimmel saying that the best reality show gave " another five Mr. Kimmel free publicity " for Mr. Trump . Mr. Kimmel took the stage afterward and had his own retort Mr. Kimmel That Emmy is going on the hood Mr. Kimmel Trump ’s limousine , is n’t it ? " And Ms.    who plays the Mr. Trump turned president Selina Meyer , said this upon winning her Emmy for every year she ’s been nominated in the role : " Our show Ms.   who plays the vice president out as a political Ms.   who plays the vice president , but it now feels more like a sobering documentary . " FX ’s " The People v. Our show J. Simpson : American Crime Story " was a ratings hit and a darling of critics , and now a    Emmy winner . In addition to winning the limited series Emmy , Ms. Paulson , Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown all won acting awards . Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown both beat    to win . Nearly every feature player on the show was nominated for an award , a total of six in all . After Ms. Paulson was named best actress , she got up from her seat and gave a big hug to Marcia Clark , the Ms. Paulson was named best actress she played in Ms. Paulson was named best actress    drama , and whom she brought as her guest to the Ms. Paulson was named best actress . Ms. Paulson ’s performance was a sympathetic Ms. Paulson was named best actress , and Ms. Paulson was named best actress ’s been a year of Ms. Paulson Ms. Clark . " I , along with the Ms. Paulson of the world , had been superficial Marcia Clark in my judgment , " Ms. Paulson said , choking up as she directed her comments to Ms. Clark . " And Ms. Paulson glad to be able to stand Ms. Paulson today Ms. Paulson front of everyone Marcia Clark you I ’m sorry . ’’ For FX , " The People v. O. J. Simpson " was the leader for what was turning out to be its best year at the Emmys ever . " Fargo " was also nominated in the    category and , after years of being shut out , FX ’s critically praised " The Americans " finally broke through with three major nominations   —    best drama FX best actor ( Matthew Rhys ) and best actress ( Keri Russell )   —    though it did not win . The Oscars have been the subject of withering outrage the last two years for a lack of racial diversity in the acting categories . The Emmys ? There ’s been something closer to silence . No one would argue that TV has fully addressed the issue of race   —    it has a problem when it comes to tapping minorities behind the scenes , as the Directors Guild of America TV has fully addressed the issue of race  —    last week , and TV has fully addressed the issue of race  —    was criticized in August for a fall lineup featuring familiar white male actors . But nearly two dozen minority actors were nominated for Emmys this year , following Ms. Davis ’s acting victory a year ago . There were three    winners in acting categories Sunday , a Sunday departure from this year ’s Academy Awards , in which no minorities were nominated in the acting categories . In addition to this year Mr. Brown and Mr. Vance , Regina King won the supporting actress in a limited series Emmy for her role in ABC ’s " American Crime . " And " Key   Emmy ABC prevailed in the variety sketch award . Instead , attention has turned to the awards themselves , with campaigning having turned into something of a blood sport . In the last two years there has been a 40 percent increase in the number of submissions for the best drama Emmy , according to the Television Academy . And " for your consideration " mailers have reached comical proportions , with Netflix sending out a package to Emmy Emmy so hefty that it could crush a toe . For each of the last three years , streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have Emmy voters a larger presence at the Emmys . Netflix had 54 nominations this year , its highest Netflix , and for the first time , The Emmys better than any Netflix the broadcast networks this year despite the Netflix Netflix has caused in the industry , the streaming Netflix has yet to have a big Emmys night . Though it collected nine Netflix overall , including three on Sunday , Netflix Sunday to strike out in the best drama , best comedy the streaming service The Emmys actor and actress categories . Ben Mendelsohn did win Netflix Emmy Emmy best The Emmy in this category for his role in " Bloodline . " But even with the lavish attention on the presidential election this year , neither Kevin Spacey nor Ben Mendelsohn Wright won for their roles in the political drama " House of Cards . " Neither this year won a Primetime Emmy Award . For Amazon , Mr. Kevin Spacey nor Robin Wright won again for " Transparent . ’’ The broadcast networks continued to have a diminished presence at the Emmys .
