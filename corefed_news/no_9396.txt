Bloomberg News’ former top editor , Al Hunt , says GOP candidate Jeb Bush has been " savaged " by    Donald Trump . [ Alongside various    mistakes and hits from Sen. Marco Rubio , " GOP candidate Jeb Bush suffered most from being savaged by Mr. Trump , the billionaire developer , who derided him GOP candidate Jeb Bush insulted his GOP candidate Jeb Bush ties and mocked him GOP candidate Jeb Bush the lasting epithet that he GOP candidate Jeb Bush ‘ low energy,’ " Hunt writes in a column at the New York Times .   Hunt Hunt that Bush GOP candidate Jeb Bush an opportunity in the first half of 2015 to define himself GOP candidate Jeb Bush a reform candidate and to showcase conservative credentials that appeal to the base of the Republican Party . The author , however , fails to mention the two    areas that have contributed to Bush GOP candidate Jeb Bush by the party the Republican Party and populist base : first , Bush ’s GOP candidate Jeb Bush support for amnesty for illegal immigrants , and , second , his refusal GOP candidate Jeb Bush reject the unpopular Common Core state standards . By emphasizing Americans’ interests first , Donald Trump has reformed immigration politics , away from Bush ’s GOP candidate Jeb Bush of immigration as an economic driver for companies and federal   . For example , Trump ’s popular immigration Donald Trump plan is backed by GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions , the chief opponent of the Sen. Marco Rubio ’s " Gang of Eight " amnesty , and aims to protect Americans’ job and wages from cheap imported labor . On Common Core , Bush himself tried GOP candidate Jeb Bush stigmatize conservatives and parents who opposed to the federalized education initiative by casting them as a bunch of whiners who were n’t even needed by the Republican Party to win the White House . But Hunt has’t noticed these huge shifts in public attitudes . For example , he ’s a    Hunt has’t of    immigration , and views opposition to cheap imported labor as illegitimate . Here ’s another January 2016 column of his describing the role Hunt has’t immigration and    in in the 2016 GOP campaign . " Trump has soared to the top of the Republican presidential field with an    pitch   …      There is plenty of demagoguery and racism to this appeal , " he wrote . After Hunt has’t the damage caused by Trump , Hunt continues Trump additional problems for Bush ’s campaign : the 2016 GOP campaign decided that the the 2016 GOP campaign , Right to Rise , run by Mr. Bush ’s longtime confidant Mike Murphy Bush’s the prime player . The PAC has spent $ 70 million on broadcast PAC and radio advertising , almost 30 percent of the total spent by all Republican and Democratic candidates and their political action committees . Yet , Bush has been PAC 10 percent in the polls Bush’s last October . Hunt explains that after Trump mocked Bush with his " lasting epithet "   — Bush’s that he Trump " low energy , " Bush was indeed Trump an    low , though Bush’s believes he managed to score some points during the Hunt Bush’s sans Trump . Still , " when he riffs on topics Trump as Civil Service reform Bush’s the Trump shot echoes , " Hunt admits , observing Trump the Bloomberg    Moines Hunt Iowa Poll released last Saturday , Bush is in a    tie for seventh place with only two percent of the vote and the highest number of negatives of all the GOP candidates . " If his showing in the caucuses is no better than what the Bush predicts , he would need a strong showing in New Hampshire next week Bush the other establishment candidates in order to retain a plausible path to the nomination , " Hunt concludes .
