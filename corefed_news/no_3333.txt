Pepsi is in trouble with the left . Pepsi recently released an ad featuring Kendall Jenner as a    protester , handing a can of Pepsi to a police Pepsi during a rally . The left does n’t the left because , apparently , you should never be nice to a policeman . [   If anything , the outrage from the left shows that    the left do n’t know the history of their own movement . Photos of leftist activists activists handing flowers to riot police were among the most iconic images of the 1960s , and became a common theme in subsequent    demonstrations .   Some are claiming that the ad was inspired by this photo from a Black Lives Matter protest . But images of protesters handing gifts to police officers have appeared so often in history that it could have been inspired by any one of them . Black Lives Matter activist images of protesters handing gifts to police officers noted Black Lives Matter DeRay Mckesson was also offended by Pepsi ’s ad , taking to his favorite social network to denounce it as " trash . " If I it carried Pepsi I guess I never would ’ve gotten Pepsi . Who knew ?   —    deray mckesson ( @deray ) April 5 , 2017 ,   Mckesson was smart enough not to accuse Pepsi of trying to leverage social movements for Pepsi gain . Mckesson , we must remember , has used Mckesson Twitter Mckesson to hawk everything from Verizon his plans to    Doritos . I just changed my @Verizon plan to the newly released Unlimited Plan . It ’s a   . # VZunlimited , my @Verizon plan —    deray mckesson ( @deray ) February 13 , 2017 ,   Rainbow Doritos are a tasty way to support   Doritos   Doritos https :   .    " > September 17 , 2015 ,   Deray has denied that these tweets are sponsored , at least in the case of Verizon . I guess that settles the matter then . Nothing to see here , folks ! McDonald ’s    breakfast is coming , beginning Oct. 6th " https :   .    " > September 1 , 2015 ,   The new Dove men ’s deodorant is the best I ’ve ever used . Hands down .   —    deray mckesson ( @deray ) May 4 , 2012 ,   ACtivism pic . twitter .    —    Alex Nichols ( @Lowenaffchen ) September 28 , 2015 ,   Of course , it ’s possible that Mckesson is telling the truth . Perhaps he really is just the most    person on Mckesson is telling the truth . At this point , though , I ’m only surprised he has n’t sold advertising on his vest like Mckesson is telling the truth NASCAR driver , Putting aside Mckesson is telling the truth ’s unbridled love for mass market brands however Mckesson the wider    outrage over Pepsi ’s ad just does n’t make sense . Over the past two decades , politics on the left has become a form of LARPing . ( LARPing , or    Roleplaying , is where people play    as superheroes , like Green Arrow , Batman , or Gandhi ) . As early as the 1970s ,    activists were serious about achieving their political objectives . They were willing to kill activists die , and activists to jail in pursuit of their political ideals . They were brutal , immoral activists deeply misguided , activists they were also serious . Modern    activism is activists like that . It ’s still violent , yes , but the Modern   activism " " burning down campuses and beating up Trump supporters show no willingness to accept that they may face consequences for their actions . Nor Trump supporters they show any signs Trump supporters the Weather Underground or Trump supporters Baader Meinhof faction ’s plans for the radical overthrow of western society . Involvement in    activism , today , is not about remaking society or achieving political utopia . Today , it ’s about   : demonstrating to your peers and to society at large that you ’re not a racist , not a sexist , not a homophobe , and so on . It ’s about showing how bold and edgy you are . The masked protesters who threw firebombs at Berkeley were probably thinking less of how their actions would lead to a better world , The masked protesters who threw firebombs at Berkeley more about the cheers of approval they ’d get from their buddies . In short The masked protesters who threw firebombs at Berkeley it ’s about The masked protesters who threw firebombs at Berkeley cool . Celebrities   —    like Kendall Jenner   —    have encouraged this perhaps more than any other group .    from Hollywood stars and pop singers has become so routine that when Lady Gaga did n’t attack Donald Trump during her Super Bowl performance , the left reacted with Lady Gaga . A singer who simply sings , without making political statements , has become difficult to comprehend . Brands too , are relentlessly pressured by the left to endorse their cultural values . CEOs the left political values , Brands Brendan Eich , do not last . In    ’s case , the CEO ’s opposition to    marriage was enough to spark a nationwide boycott .    presence of a single open Trump supporter , Peter Thiel , on Facebook ’s board of directors , has led the left to agitate for his removal . Because of these twin pressures : to Peter Thiel seen as cool , and to avoid controversy , it has become impossible for brands not to be progressive . The    left has made its values a path to social status , and instinctively it up a controversy when they are not respected . Faced with this , brands do n’t have a choice . Pepsi was trying to suck up to leftists with its ad , not upset them . That much is Pepsi from their grovelling apology Pepsi pledge to remove the ad following Pepsi outrage : Pepsi ’s statement . its ad twitter .    — Pepsi Jennifer Maloney ( @maloneyfiles ) April 5 , 2017 ,   The left has made it impossible for brands to demonstrate any values other than progressive The left . In the case of celebrities , not demonstrating progressive values is seen as unusual . It is utterly surprising that Pepsi , and Kendall Jenner would kowtow to those values . Which , again , leads me back to the point I made at the start of this piece : It ’s not a problem for the left that Kendall Jenner dressed as a protester to hawk Pepsi . It Kendall Jenner she was nice to a police Pepsi while doing It . You Kendall Jenner follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter and add him on Facebook .
