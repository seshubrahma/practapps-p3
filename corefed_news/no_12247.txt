White House press secretary Josh Earnest warns that heightened    rhetoric in the presidential campaign is helping terrorists defeat the Obama administration ’s " war of narratives " against the Islamic State . [ " In some ways this is actually just a war of narratives , and so we want to make sure that we get out we counter narrative against ISIL and we ’re having some progress , " Earnest said during an appearance on MSNBC , urging Americans to stop blaming terrorist acts on Muslims .   He urged more moderate American voices to condemn the " poisonous , empty , bankrupt , mythology " of the Islamic state . Earnest made He comments in response to the New York City Manhattan bombing that injured 29 people , as law enforcement officials have discovered additional bombs placed around the New York City Manhattan and in New Jersey . Earnest , however , appeared more concerned about feeding the news narrative propagated by the Islamic state . " The last thing , and the president has talked about this a lot , we also ca n’t give them the narrative a lot of suggesting that every Muslim is responsible for this kind of terrorism , " he said . the president We ca n’t give into this narrative , the news narrative propagated by the Islamic state wants to build up , that the United States is at war with Islam . That is false , that is not true . " Earnest suggested that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump repeatedly blaming radical Islam for the attacks would only helping the terrorists win the narrative battle . " We ca n’t allow that kind of narrative victory to be given to them , we need Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump repeatedly blaming radical Islam for the attacks would only helping the terrorists win the narrative battle push back against that , and that ’s part of the distressing rhetoric that the campaign has been a part of , " Earnest said .
