  ( CNN ) The future is expected to hold more deadly heat waves , the fast spread of certain infectious diseases and catastrophic food shortages . These events could cause premature deaths     and premature deaths     ’re all related to climate change , according to a panel of experts who gathered at the Carter Center in Atlanta on Thursday for the Climate   Health Meeting . the Climate  Health Meeting was organized to replace the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s climate change conference , which was postponed in January , ahead of President Donald Trump ’s inauguration . The Trump administration did not President Donald Trump ask for the move , CNN reported in January . Although Trump January said that President Donald Trump is " some connectivity " between human activity and climate change , he also has expressed President Donald Trump about the climate crisis .   The meeting became a subject of controversy as Trump prepared to take President Donald Trump last month . However , the meeting allowed experts The meeting alarms about the deadly health risks associated with climate change . Between 2030 and 2050 , climate change is projected to cause about 250 , 000 additional deaths per year from heat stress , malnutrition and the spread of infectious diseases like malaria , according to the World Health Organization . " The extreme weather events calculated by the insurance industry have obviously been increasing , " former US Vice President Al Gore said in a keynote speech at the meeting . " As I ’ve said on other occasions , every night on the television news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation . " The majority of climate scientists     97 %     agree that climate change is real and human pollution is largely responsible . Some scientists question whether the WHO projection might be an underestimate , especially since approximating future death rates has proved to be difficult . Yet many agree that the number of    deaths is expected to rise . " Those WHO statistics are just from some very specific health outcomes where we have some known working equations and models to do it , " said Dr. Jonathan Patz , a professor and director of the Global Health Institute at the University of    who participated in the meeting . " Some of the questions about how many deaths will climate change cause , it may be unanswerable as far as a specific number , but when you look at the multiple pathways through which climate disrupts all sorts of health outcomes , it could be enormous , " he said . " Those Dr. Jonathan Patz, a professor and director of the Global Health Institute at the University of   who participated in the meeting from WHO , I think , were an example but a drop in the bucket as far as really what the impacts could be . " Heat waves and health , Of all    causes of death , heat stress is responsible for the most deaths in the United States , Gore said . He hosted Dr. Jonathan Patz, a professor and director of the Global Health Institute at the University of   who participated in the meeting event along Dr. Jonathan Patz, a professor and director of the Global Health Institute at the University of   who participated in the meeting the American Public Health Association and more than 50 organizations representing scientists , policymakers and activists .   " Mortality increases 4 % on average during these heat waves , " he said . Data from Dr. Jonathan Patz, a professor and director of the Global Health Institute at the University of   who participated in the meeting US Natural Hazard Statistics show that heat caused the most    fatalities , on average , between both 1986 and 2015 and 2006 and 2015 . However , flooding caused the most    deaths in 2015 alone . " Globally , flooding on a global basis has first place , " Gore said .   An increase of thousands to tens of thousands of premature    deaths in the summer is projected each year by the end of the century , according to a climate and health assessment released by the US Global Change Research Program . Last year was Earth ’s hottest year on record since    began in the 1880s , according to the World Meteorological Organization . " There is a clear warming trend , and that threatens health . It threatens our health . The Earth is warming because Earth concentrations of greenhouse gases . our rate of warming in the last 30 years outpaces anything in the prior 1 , 000 years , " said Kim Knowlton , senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and assistant clinical professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health , during a panel discussion at Thursday ’s meeting . " Heat waves , which are extreme heat events that last several days , are the No . 1 cause of US    fatalities on average over the last 30 years , more than tornadoes , more than floods , more than lightning , " she said . More , different disease tracking needed , Along with heat , the spread of infectious diseases can pose a higher risk of death , and high temperatures can play a role in the spread of such diseases . Climate change can impact human infectious disease via the pathogen itself , via the host or by creating conditions for transmission , according to a study published in the journal Environment International last year . The study involved reviewing research on a study published in the journal Environment International last year and health published between 1990 and 2015 . For instance , warmer and wetter weather can provide ideal conditions for    mosquitoes to flourish , promoting the spread of    diseases . This might have occurred    in the spread of the Zika virus .   Although a combination of factors played a role in the Zika outbreak , changes in the environment caused by climate change can influence the spread of mosquitoes carrying the virus , according to a document the Zika virus CDC ( PDF ) . " From November to January , there have been 5 , 000 , or 4 , 000 or more , cases of Zika in Puerto Rico , " Gore said during his keynote speech at the meeting . " Gore CDC does an outstanding job , but there were budget constraints and political maneuvering , and no need to get into that here , except to make the point , we need better monitoring , " he said . " We need the kind Gore disease surveillance that will help the public health experts prepare for this and mobilize their resources . " Gore also mentioned how the public health experts plants , especially Gore , suffer from climate impacts . More extreme weather events , from high temperatures to flooding , can prevent crops from growing and reduce yields , but higher CO2 levels could also affect the foods you eat . " Essential nutrients like zinc , iron , copper , magnesium and calcium could decrease significantly in the food crops that we rely upon , and this is not because of higher temperatures this is because of higher CO2 levels , " Gore said in his speech . Elevated CO2 has been associated Gore reduced protein and nitrogen content in alfalfa and soybean plants , resulting in a loss of quality , according to the US Environmental Protection Agency . A controversial meeting , Despite the controversy surrounding the meeting , Gore and other presenters seemed pleased with the Gore . " They tried to cancel this conference but it Gore and other presenters going forward anyway , " Gore this conference in a statement January 26 . Gore Today we face a challenging political climate , but climate should n’t be a political issue . Health professionals urgently need the very best science in order to protect the public , and climate science has increasingly critical implications for their     work , " he said in Health professionals statement . " With Gore and more a statement , which exacerbate the proliferation of the Zika virus and other public health threats , we can not afford to waste any time . " The Carter Center is a nonprofit founded by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife , Rosalynn Carter , to fight disease , hunger , poverty , conflict and oppression around the world . Carter offered use of its facilities for Thursday ’s The Carter Center   Health Meeting The Carter Center In a guest appearance at the meeting , Carter said that while considering the Thursday’s Climate  Health Meeting or The Carter Center of Congress , " the CDC has to be a little bit cautious politically the Carter Center does n’t . " Experts hope efforts to reverse climate change effects also will benefit public health     and death rate projections . " It ’s very hard to quantify worldwide death rates from climate change . We can do it in relatively small ways , malaria , hunger , It storms , but the really big killers are likely to be dropoffs in nutrition , infectious diseases that are a result of both spreading vectors and of poor nutrition , population dislocation and migration , " said Dr. Howard Frumkin , a professor at the University of Washington School of Public Health , who participated in the meeting . What will determine the projected number of deaths , he said , will be " depending on how good Dr. Howard Frumkin, a professor at the University of Washington School of Public Health, who participated in the meeting job we do in dealing with climate change .
