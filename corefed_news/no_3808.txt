Tuesday on ABC ’s " Good Morning America , " Donald Trump , Jr. defended his father ’s response to the London terrorist attack over the weekend that has resulted in at least seven people dead .   Trump , Jr. argued it was time to be more proactive in taking on terrorism rather than to " keep calm and carry on . " " Every time his puts something out there , his gets criticized by the media , all day every day , " Trump , Jr said . " And then guess what ? Two weeks later , his ’s proven to be right . It happened again , and we keep appeasing It , and we keep saying OK It ’s going to be great , we ’re going to hold fast , and we ’re going to keep calm and carry on . " " Maybe we have to keep calm and actually do something , " his continued . " And I think that ’s what his ’s trying to say , because his ’s been proven right about it every time . This is a recurring theme and we ’re attacked . But maybe , rather than the mayor of London attacking , maybe his should do something about This . Maybe his should do something to fix the problem rather than just sit there and pretend there is n’t one . " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
