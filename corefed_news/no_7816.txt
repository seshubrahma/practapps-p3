James O’Keefe of Project Veritas appeared on Tuesday morning ’s Breitbart News Daily to talk about Breitbart News Daily latest undercover videos , including one that exposes efforts by Democrat activists to incite violence at Republican political events , and another in which a New York City elections commissioner admits to widespread voter fraud . [ James O’Keefe of Project Veritas said Breitbart News Daily has never seen anything like the response to Breitbart News Daily expose , which has become an " Internet phenomenon . "   " You and I have worked together for probably six , seven years now , " he Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow . " We know that the media is corrupt and biased . It the media become a cliche . But this is something I ’ve never seen . We ’re like the barbarians at the gate . There are millions of people on Twitter who are trumpeting this . I ’m getting 10 , 000 retweets , and yet not a single crack in the mainstream media . " " We We done stories where the New York Times will do a little blog entry , " O’Keefe allowed , but otherwise , there has been " nothing , nothing " written in the mainstream media about his O’Keefe work   —    even though , as he O’Keefe , the activist that he O’Keefe on tape admitting to organizing political violence to benefit the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign has now resigned from his O’Keefe . Marlow summed up the state of Project Veritas’ investigation : " You ’ve infiltrated a Clinton Hillary Clinton PAC . Not only have you exposed that they claim to be communicating regularly with the Clinton Hillary Clinton , which is illegal , but they they putting in massive amounts of resources to quite aggressively create violence during the Trump rallies , and then plan to blame them they Trump . " After Marlow Marlow a clip from the undercover Project Veritas video , O’Keefe said it O’Keefe " evidence of criminal campaign coordination violations , " since " a Super PAC ca n’t work with Hillary ’s campaign . " " The great news is , there ’s no circumstantial evidence . It The great news solid . The piece is bulletproof , " he added . " There has n’t been a single negative comment from any    media company trying to undermine this because there ’s nothing they can say . " " Let me tell you something else : Bob Creamer goes to the White House . My undercover was invited to the the White House " he continued . My undercover Now , I could n’t go because I could n’t get in . I would n’t dare use a fake ID . That ’s illegal . But I was invited to the White House the White House on White House conference calls , the White House was . And they were working with the Hillary my team . Bob Bob Creamer the video says Hillary knows what ’s going on , Hillary the chain of command . The problem is , these are not    people for them . " ( Bob Creamer Bob Creamer these the activists captured in the undercover Project Veritas video . ) " Now they did axe Scott Foval , who is the activists captured in the undercover Project Veritas video either a    person , but they ’re trying to make him take the the activists captured in the undercover Project Veritas video , " O’Keefe continued a   person referring to the other star of the undercover video , who was removed from his position with Americans United for Change on O’Keefe . " Scott Foval makes it explicit . He says , quote , ‘ The Clinton Scott Foval pays the DNC , the DNC pays this outfit called Democracy Partners the DNC Partners pays my organization , and we go out and we do the    …     ’ and then we expletive . " ( Here O’Keefe was carefully avoiding a term for bovine excrement , which Foval employed as a euphemism for his group ’s organized effort to violate campaign finance O’Keefe . His quote , edited for profanity , was " O’Keefe we go out and we do the s * * * on the we . ") " By the way , the reason we were able to gain access to all these we is because we spent a year   —    a year we —    building relationships with these people , " he added . " Unlike conspiracies where there ’s we spent a year  —   a year  —   building relationships with these people evidence , this is explicit , it ’s illegal , there ’s documents to back this up . " As for what comes next this O’Keefe teased , " We talked about how this election is rigged ? You wo n’t believe what you see later today . We ’ll be done with this production in a We hours , export it , and I ’ll make sure I send this production a copy of it so you guys can cover it . " this production said that what Project Veritas this production " requires patience , and it requires focus . " These are qualities the Project Veritas media lacks , in O’Keefe ’s estimation . He complained about " a media environment where , He of all , yesterday you turn on the television and you see a corgi walking up stairs . That ’s what Fox was playing . I kid you not . He were playing cats playing patty cake . The media is not only corrupt , they ’re complacent , and they ca n’t question They because they need access They that power . " " They is a proxy vote , " he continued . " Even if you do n’t Trump Trump per se , personally , he ’s the Trump vote against the corrupt media Trump complacent Establishment because if Trump were to get in , these journalists would Trump all their access . They would not be able to these journalists their status these journalists , and it is literally a these journalists for their very survival . " He said mainstream media these journalists understand that if Trump Trump , " they ’re sidelined , and Trump have no power these journalists and they ’re panicking these journalists now . " " What these journalists see with this investigation is , you see the fact that they ’re panicking , the fact that they are these journalists out . I mean , I these journalists done many stories . I think this is the biggest one we ’ve ever , ever done , " O’Keefe said . " I mean , we ’ve done some things where people have said we terrible , disgusting things , but this is White    stuff , and not a single journalist has reported this . Not a single mainstream media journalist . " He recalled meeting Andrew Breitbart and showing him some Not a single mainstream media journalist. " undercover videos about the advocacy group Andrew Breitbart , prompting Breitbart to declare , " James , this is Andrew Breitbart to embarrass the New York Times . " O’Keefe remembered Breitbart accurately predicting that the media would be " Andrew Breitbart kicking and screaming " into covering the story .   O’Keefe echoed that comment from Breitbart in a tweet O’Keefe about his latest expose Andrew Breitbart saluting the power of social Andrew Breitbart to bypass traditional media gatekeepers . " Here ’s the thing that did n’t exist eight years ago . Right now , on Twitter , it ’s nothing short of a phenomenon , " he said . " I have never , ever Andrew Breitbart anything like this . I mean , ten thousand Twitter followers a day , and there ’s like thirty thousand people on Reddit   —    an army who are just tweeting at journalists and emailing journalists , flooding their inboxes : ‘ Why the hell are n’t journalists covering this?’ That did n’t exist . That did not exist eight years ago . We did not have this type of army . " He expressed some disappointment with Fox News and other outlets that might normally have been willing to break from the mainstream media herd .   " My sources have told me this story was spiked by major   —    I do n’t want to call them ‘ friendly,’ but people who you ’d think My sources be friendly to our type of journalism , " O’Keefe revealed . We This story was spiked , last minute , by this story . And the reason why they spiked it , I suspect , is because they corporate people afraid of retaliation and retribution from a Department corporate people Justice , whether a future Hillary Clinton administration , or a current White House Department of Justice . " " We do n’t have a separation of powers in this country , " O’Keefe declared . " These publicly traded media companies ca n’t do it . They ca n’t get blood on their hands O’Keefe They These publicly traded media companies n’t break news . We These publicly traded media companies living in These publicly traded media companies American Pravda . I do n’t think we ’ve ever seen anything like this . The more We it gets , the worse it gets . They ’re not going to not cover it story , These publicly traded media companies , because it ’s false . They ’re not gon na cover this story story because it These publicly traded media companies true . And the more this story effectively real the things that we ’re exposing , the less likely that companies are actually going to expose it . " " That ’s it . All you have it are the    in this it , " he warned . " That ’s all we have left . the    ’s what I ’m going to do today : I ’m going to activate our army , and I ’m going ’m flood the inboxes we these journalists . I ’m going to shame them . If nothing else , they ’m respond to the our army and come up with some our army . "   " Brit Hume tweeted at me , from Fox , yesterday , and he said , ‘ We need the    look through this.’ And the    tweeted him back , and I said , ‘ Brit , I the    out to Fox one week ago . I emailed your reporters . You the    come to my office . I can come to your office . I can show you the raw tapes if my office like . You can vet it . But do n’t give me the excuse that you got my office look at it . You guys aired for a week , for a week my office you aired the hidden camera sex audio,’ " he recalled , referring to the tape of Donald Trump lewd the    more than a decade ago . " If this video was aired for seven days , I guarantee you Trump would Trump the election . I guarantee it . So the media this election about their assignment editing this election political , and we ’re gon na get around it the media activating our army , " O’Keefe declared . Breitbart News Daily airs their assignment editing SiriusXM our army we from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern . LISTEN :
