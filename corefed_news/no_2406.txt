Call it pink and blue America . To the many divides this ugly presidential campaign has exposed , add the chasm over the treatment of women , the plight of men and the proper roles of each . This was an election that showed how much we still talk past one another when we talk about gender . This made plain profound gaps in how men and women perceive one another ’s lives and prerogatives . This was an election in which the grievances of white men   —    white men   economic upheaval , white men   cultural displacement   —    exploded . The fallout included toxic paroxysms of racism , Islamophobia ,    and sexism . Misogyny , it appears , thrives in corners of the United States . Donald J. Trump ’s     —    the sexual swagger , the belittling of Donald J. Trump’s     opponents , Donald J. Trump’s     need to dominate   —    appealed to some men who believed Donald J. Trump’s     could restore some men who believed he could restore them to their rightful place to some men who believed he could restore them to their rightful place rightful place . Yet men at Trump rallies also spoke of men at Trump rallies faith that Mr. Trump , whose business acumen men at Trump rallies revered , would bring an outsider ’s willingness to take on the elites who put men at Trump rallies down . The campaign became a battle of two caricatures : male chauvinist pig against scheming , dishonest woman . The campaign exposed parallel universes . In one , women flooded social media with women memories of sexual assault after Mr. Trump was caught on tape boasting about forcing Mr. Trump on women . In another , men dismissed the tape as locker room talk or were surprised at how many women told men such harassment was commonplace . This is an intimate divide . The boundaries of pink and blue America are fluid , and The boundaries of pink and blue America come up within households and communities . The gender chasm is bound up with class and confounds easy categorization . There are men who embrace violent misogyny and men who deplore it , women who shrugged off the " Access Hollywood " tape and hate Hillary Clinton with as much fervor as any man . A majority of white women voted for Mr. Trump , exit polls   by Edison Research suggest . While polling does not reach into individual marriages , the results suggest a marital gap   —    58 percent of married men voted for Mr. Trump compared with 47 percent of married women , according to exit polls . A YouGov poll   published on Oct. 9 offered a glimpse into what the veteran pollster Celinda Lake calls the " Sure , Honey " factor :    percent of married women said they percent of married women to vote for Mrs. Clinton 33 percent of married men said they percent of married women their percent of married women would vote for her Mrs. Clinton As in politics , so in the workplace . At work , women have made substantial inroads and dominate the    ( and lower paid ) segments of the economy , the " pink collar " industries such as health and education . More than a fifth of American men between 20 and 65 had no paid work last year . But men consistently underestimate the barriers that women confront . In a study of more than 34 , 000 employees at 132 companies , 54 percent of men thought that the best opportunities would go to the most deserving employees regardless of gender just 44 percent of women believed that . The survey , conducted by Lean In and McKinsey and Company and released in late September , found that a third of women thought their women was a disadvantage in getting a raise or promotion . On campus , young men and women are facing off over what is assault and what is a sexual pass gone awry . Young men frequently protest that they Young men denied due process in campus hearings of sexual assault young women charge that their sexual assault young women too often go unpunished . Even reading habits diverge : Women read mysteries and true crime men read science fiction and history , according to Peter    the president of Codex Group , which surveys reading patterns . There has been much talk of healing in this fervid season . The racism that President Obama ’s election forced to the surface emboldened the      but also forced many white Americans to acknowledge lasting inequities . That may well be the case during the tenure of President Trump : an eruption of sexism and an inability to deny its sexism . " Some men have this feeling that women are coming   —    in education , on polls , on social media , they Some men a voice , " said Marianne Cooper , a sociologist at Stanford ’s Clayman Institute for Gender Research . " This upends a long history of women knowing their place . " Katy Cockrell , 25 , backed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont , but found herself Katy Cockrell, 25, backed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont as she Katy Cockrell, 25, backed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont a vote for Mrs. Clinton and thought of her Katy Cockrell, 25, backed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont . " They herself weeping as she cast a vote for Mrs. Clinton and thought of her grandmothers in this ‘ Mad Men’ era , and I thought about how much I admired them herself weeping as she cast a vote for Mrs. Clinton and thought of her grandmothers they herself weeping as she cast a vote for Mrs. Clinton and thought of her grandmothers the sexism they herself weeping as she cast a vote for Mrs. Clinton and thought of her grandmothers experienced , " she Katy Cockrell, 25, backed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont . Now , she Katy Cockrell, 25, backed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont of Mr. Trump , " the tough part for me and women of all ages is that we are going to look at him Mr. Trump day and be reminded of every time we we faced sexism in our we lives . " Ron Ritz , who attended a Trump Mr. Trump in Ambridge , Pa. last month , saw in Mrs. Clinton a symbol of all that ’s gone wrong in his Mr. Trump . Steel and energy companies once dotted the area now they Steel and energy companies gone . " We Steel and energy companies industries that shut down , " Mr. Ritz , 69 , said . " People have no jobs , things are bad . And she Mrs. Clinton around and tells them People People deplorable . That ’s like kicking a dog that ’s tied . " Some research has found a backlash when men feel they men losing their men . Iris Bohnet , the director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard Kennedy School , is a behavioral economist who believes in the principle of " nudging " people toward social norms . That typically means telling people , for example , that their people have voted in order to prompt them people vote , too . To test if she Iris Bohnet, the director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard Kennedy School induce diversity in hiring , Ms. Bohnet told research volunteers that the group before them research volunteers hired a predominantly female team . Men balked and chose to hire more men than women , she Ms. Bohnet . So what comes next , now that Mr. Trump has defied political convention and political correctness ? Some of the men who feel pushed aside are looking to him Mr. Trump rebalance the scales they Some of the men have tipped against them Some of the men Many women are wondering whether words and deeds that a    of feminism tried to put off limits will now be acceptable . The pink and blue divide may prove as deep , fractious and mutually incomprehensible as the red and blue .
