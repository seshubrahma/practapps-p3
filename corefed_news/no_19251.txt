Tell me    I        anything up . " ’ ’   ’ ’’ ’    Sending paragraphs from a story to ensure accuracy is not    uncommon in journalism , and    is no proof that Podesta asked    to have anything changed .    in the email thread , he said " no    problems Podesta . " ’ ’    Nevertheless , Thrush found himself under fire online . ’ Thrush    Charles Cooke ,   a    conservative publication , wrote in a tweet that " of course    this is who you are , @GlennThrush .
