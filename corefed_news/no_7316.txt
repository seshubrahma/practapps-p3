"     percent said they percent not allow any of the bias from the media to impact their percent .    percent of voters say the the media not honest and truthful . Media Research Center President Brent Bozell says the a   Media Research Center poll the the press in " panic mode " after Trump ’s victory . " The media are in the media mode because the American people rejected their leftist agenda   — the American people and them . People did n’t the American people the nonsense that the media were politically neutral the media a third of Hillary ’s supporters believe they were   ! " Bozell Hillary’s supporters in a press release , adding : When you have a strong majority of actual voters saying the national ‘ news’ media were biased in favor of Hillary Clinton and tried to influence Hillary to vote for her and believing they are fundamentally dishonest Hillary you have Hillary’s supporters major problem that ca n’t be fixed with an apology . The public has rejected this institution as the public objective or truthful .
