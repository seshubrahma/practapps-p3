Jonathan Easley writes at the Hill :   Donald Trump hammered Hillary Clinton on trade and immigration at a rally in Michigan on Friday , as Donald Trump made the case that Democrats’ policies have failed the black community . The speech was notable in that Donald Trump used a teleprompter   —    something Donald Trump ’s done in the past for major policy addresses , but has rarely been seen at Donald Trump massive rallies . Donald Trump also used a prompter at Thursday ’s rally in Charlotte , N. C. and the GOP nominee seems to be growing more comfortable reading from a screen . Some of Trump ’s earlier speeches were stilted or stiff , but on Friday Donald Trump was smoother and at times Donald Trump left the script to improvise without going too far off track . " Hillary Clinton is a legacy of death , destruction and terrorism , " Trump said , reading from prepared text . " America deserves a better legacy . All of you deserve a better future . I am the change agent . " The GOP nominee then broke from the teleprompter to personally address the crowd . " I am your messenger    …      nothing more than your messenger , "   …      said .

Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo , or what we have .
