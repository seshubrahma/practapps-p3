In August of 2009 , tea party activists were instructed by Tea Party Patriots , Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Works to go to Congressional Town Halls and confront Democrat Congressmen over support of ObamaCare . [ Tea Party Patriots even passed out an " action memo " to be used as a guide for tea party activists attending Congressional Town Halls .   The memo an "action memo" to be used as a guide for tea party activists attending Congressional Town Halls to give Congressmen " reality checks " from " We the People " at the town Congressional Town Halls activists that attended the town halls were Congressional Town Halls Congressmen into changing their position on ObamaCare . Fox News Congressmen other conservative media outlets were very supportive of this action at the town halls . In 2013 Congressional Town Halls Patriots led the way in organizing activists to attend Congressional Town Halls and " pressure " Republican Senators and Congressmen about the " Gang of Eight " Immigration Bill . The strategy was very successful in getting elected officials to change their support of the immigration bill . Roger Stone getting elected officials planning a Eight" Immigration Bill called Stop the Steal that will take place at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland to pressure delegates not to turn their back on the will of the voters . I strongly delegates Trump supporters across the nation to attend the rally and have their voices heard . I have been astonished at the hypocritical Trump supporters across the nation of this event by the very people that were cheering the tea a similar   event called Stop the Steal that will take place at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland to pressure delegates not to turn their back on the will of the voters in 2009 when we were confronting Congressional Democrats at their town halls and also , confronting Republicans at town halls to Congressional Democrats them to change their stance on the Gang of Eight Bill in Republicans . What Republicans is organizing is no different than what activists did at the Congressional Town halls . The Republican establishment elitists and Ted Cruz are tone deaf to the message sent by millions of Republican Primary voters . Millions would completely walk away from the Republican Party and never look back if the nomination were denied Trump in a contested convention . It would cause massive damage to Republican candidates all the way down the nomination were denied Trump in a contested convention ticket . The Stop the Steal event and other rallies may actually save the Republican Party from committing political suicide by pressuring delegates in a the Republican Party to turn their back on the will of voters . The Stop the Steal rally may delegates be preview of coming attractions if Trump is denied the nomination . From what activists are telling me , they are prepared to protest at every campaign stop of the Republican nominee during what activists general election campaign . As a tea party founder and    devotee of Sen. Cruz , I am extremely disappointed to discover that he has turned into the very thing he used to rail against   — Sen. Cruz elitist establishment that think they know Sen. Cruz than average voters . Cruz is in collusion with the Republican establishment and donor class to deprive Trump Sen. Cruz the nomination . Sen. Cruz claims to be a Constitutional Conservative , yet he is systematically working Sen. Cruz Sen. Cruz of the most important rights granted in the Sen. Cruz   —    the right to vote . His campaign is using the arcane Republican Party delegate selection process to " steal the Sen. Cruz " of the millions that have cast their votes for Donald Trump . I have witnessed this first hand in Georgia on April 16 . Trump of the and his campaign systematically conspired to disenfranchise the 502 , 000 Georgians that cast their votes for His campaign on March 1 . They were successful in securing 32 delegate slots Sen. Cruz and his campaign of Trump of the for grabs on that day . Sen. Cruz and his campaign of the Georgia Grassroots Coordinators for Cruz were elected as delegates pledged to Donald Trump . Another Georgia leader for Cruz that is serving Cruz a Trump delegate , former Trump of the Barr , took the fifth when he Cruz asked on MSNBC if Trump of the would support the nominee that came out of the Republican convention . Another Georgia leader for Cruz that is serving as a Trump delegate, former Congressman Bob Barr seems Sen. Cruz ’s campaign Another Georgia leader for Cruz that is serving as a Trump delegate, former Congressman Bob Barr is that the ends justify the means , so it is ok to attempt to Cruz the will of voters . I think Sen. Cruz and some of his supporters truly believe that he is a Savior to the conservative movement and Sen. Cruz’s is ok to do Sen. Cruz’s it takes to win Sen. Cruz’s It has been extremely disappointing to see this and in the future they have lost the moral authority to challenge the establishment elitists when they use the same tactics . Sen. Cruz is extremely delusional in believing that if he is successful in knocking they Trump out at a contested Cruz , Trump supporters would get behind him . Cruz hope to be elected a Trump delegate at the Georgia GOP State Convention Donald Trump I will tell you Donald Trump I would never , under any circumstances Donald Trump support Sen. Cruz in a contested convention . Many Trump supporters view Sen. Cruz in a very negative light . I did Cruz survey of the GOP Convention social media Donald Trump asked the Cruz , " If Trump is far ahead in the GOP delegate count , Donald Trump Cruz manages to steal the nomination from him at the GOP Convention Donald Trump would you vote for Cruz over Hillary in the General Cruz ? " 574 Trump supporters responded Cruz the following way : Yes   —    3 Cruz 42 % No   —    41 . 03 Donald Trump Undecided   —    5 . 98 % Hell No   —    49 . 57 % I fully expect Donald Trump to have the nomination sewed up by the time of the convention . If not , it will be a very Donald Trump pivotal time for the Republican Party . Debbie Dooley is a Tea Party the GOP Convention   National Tea Party Leader . Twitter @crimsontider
