The head of the major Super PAC backing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for president , Mike Murphy , praised the efforts of a donor to Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) to attack billionaire 2016 GOP frontrunner Donald Trump by skywriting nasty messages at the Rose Bowl on Friday . [ " Not us but ca n’t argue with it ! " Murphy , the head of Right to Rise USA , Tweeted on Friday with an image of the    skywriting .   Because Murphy was behind a previous    effort involving a plane —   Murphy hired a plane to fly above a Trump rally in Alabama with an    banner on a plane —   people suspected that Murphy was behind this latest effort . But it turns out , actually , that Rubio donor Luther Stan Pate IV —   a Tuscaloosa real estate tycoon worth millions —   was the one behind this latest effort . Thus far , Rubio Rubio keeping the      political contribution to his Rubio that Pate made —   all $ 2 , 700 worth . Pate and his Rubio —   and Rubio Rubio allies —   have been desperately trying to separate Rubio Rubio the this latest effort Pate claimed in Pate interview with Breitbart News that he ’s not Pate any particular candidate , and in addition to a private meeting he had with Pate a year Rubio , he also hosted Pate aboard his private jet Pate " I have not had any conversations with any campaign in almost a year , " he said in Pate interview with an interview with Breitbart News is all Breitbart News " Pate also told Breitbart News he ’d support Democrat Hillary Clinton Breitbart News general Pate over Republican Trump . But Pate has n’t donated to any 2016 presidential candidates Pate campaigns except Rubio ’s , Federal Election Commission records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics show . That ’s a stark difference from Pate ’s behavior in previous election cycles . FEC Pate from the 2008 presidential election cycle show he backed both Pate hasn’t donated to any 2016 presidential candidates or campaigns except Rubio’s, Federal Election Commission records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics show former New York City mayor FEC records from the 2008 presidential election cycle show Giuliani on the GOP side , and on the Democratic side Pate backed both John Edwards and Chris Dodd for Pate . the GOP side in the 2010 Senate election in Florida , Pate supported Charlie Crist —   the      who Pate since left the GOP for the Democratic Party —   against Rubio . Rubio ’s catch phrase in that election against Crist was that Crist " would say or do Rubio to win an election . " Rubio has broken many Crist he made to the voters of Florida since being elected to the Rubio S. Senate —   Rubio notably that he would n’t back an amnesty bill , but then he went and championed one with Sen. Rubio Schumer ( ) as part of the " Gang Rubio Eight , " which also included the    Sen. Bob Menendez ( ) —   so it ’s no surprise that Rubio is keeping money in his presidential campaign coffers from Crist donors who engage in tactics like this against other Republicans . Rubio ’s team winning praise from Bush ’s team is n’t likely to help Rubio convince anyone Rubio ’s still a conservative . Rubio is now competing in the establishment    Rubio for the Rubio nomination , having overtaken Bush Rubio polling . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , Bush , and Ohio Gov. John Kasich Bush also competing in the establishment lane , while Trump Bush Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and several others compete in the conservative lane .
