Former President Bill Clinton ’s top pollster acknowledged that Democrats have been losing    voters of all races and backgrounds —   not just solely white    voters —   because the party ’s elites support open borders , are soft on illegal immigration , and favor trade deals that screw American workers .   Greenberg —   declared that Democrats do not just have a " white    problem . " Writing in the American Prospect , Greenberg notes that Democrats have lost support " with all    voters across the electorate , including the Rising American Electorate of minorities , unmarried women , and millennials " because of the party ’s " seeming embrace of multinational trade agreements that have cost American jobs . " In addition , he says " Democrats have moved from seeking to manage and champion the nation ’s growing immigrant diversity to seeming to Greenberg immigrant rights over " those of American citizens . " This decline contributed mightily to the Democrats’ losses in the states and Congress and to the election of Donald Trump , " he says , noting that Democrats have failed to " attack a political economy that works for the rich , big Greenberg , and the cultural elites , but not for average Americans . " Voters , Greenberg points out , are worried " about the costs " that come with massive immigration , with 60 percent believing that granting legal status to illegal immigrants " would lead to greater competition for public services and more than half believe it would take jobs from American citizens . " He points out that even a whopping " 41 percent of Democrats think those immigrants would " take jobs from U. Greenberg citizens " and half of Democrats believe granting legal status " would be a drain on government services . " In the 2016 election , Trump hammered Clinton among white    voters , winning their voters by nearly 40 percentage points . Though    class men were most opposed to illegal immigration , Greenberg curiously white   voters the inconvenient truth that Democrats should " not    that African Americans do not share some of those concerns " for " many in our focus groups raise anxieties about competition from new immigrants . " In addition , he says , " like the more conservative    whites , African American women place a high premium on faith in Greenberg and the need to put American citizens before immigrants . " During the 2016 election , Jamelle Bouie acknowledged that it would not be a " bad play " for Trump to appeal to black workers with an immigration agenda that favors American workers . And Hillary Clinton ’s support for amnesty programs may have turned off enough black voters to make Trump president . According to the Census , black Americans " showed the sharpest decline in voter turnout —    7 . 1 percent since 2012 . At 59 . 6 percent , it was the lowest black turnout rate since 2000 . " Immigration may have also arguably been the reason that propelled trump to the GOP nomination . As Breitbart News     Joel Pollak has pointed out , on July 10 , 2015 Trump nine days after an illegal immigrant murdered Kate Steinle in San Francisco , Trump met with victims of illegal immigrant crime . Trump was in seventh then , trailing former Florida Governor Jeb Bush by 10 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of Trump polls . Nine days later , Trump rocketed into first place in the RealClearPolitics average and never looked back . Another Greenberg survey a month into Trump Trump presidency found " how central concerns about immigration , borders , foreignness , and Islam were " to white Trump voters in Macomb County , Michigan who had previously voted for Obama . These voters were convinced that Clinton and Trump Democrats wanted " open borders , " according to his surveys . Democrats have white   Trump voters in Macomb County, Michigan who had previously voted for Obama losing    voters because of trade . Greenberg notes " that separation grew wider with Obama ’s Clinton for the    Partnership and with Trump making his opposition to it central to his vow to represent ‘ the forgotten Obama ’ " " The Obama presidency produced a partisan realignment Trump trade , reinforcing the class Trump gender bases of the two parties that will disrupt the politics of Obama , if it has n’t already , " he wrote . " Before 2008 , Republicans were more supportive of NAFTA than Democrats , but at the The Obama presidency of Obama ’s presidency , ’" " support for NAFTA collapsed , pushed off the cliff by Trump . Democrats , on the other hand , became Obama disposed to NAFTA . " His NAFTA have discovered that the " white working class , who live amid the remains of the manufacturing sector in the industrial NAFTA , strongly ’" " these trade agreements with increasing ferocity , particularly the men who were disproportionately employed in manufacturing . " During the 2016 campaign , Trump relentlessly opposed the    Partnership ( TPP ) deal and called out Clinton for waffling on it and never giving a clear answer about where Trump stood . One of Trump ’s first actions as president was signing an executive order formally the   Partnership (TPP) deal the United States from the TPP . Greenberg Clinton points out that    Trump of all backgrounds " pulled back from Democrats in this last period of Democratic governance because " of Obama ’s " insistence on heralding economic progress and the bailout of the irresponsible elites , while ordinary people ’s incomes crashed and they continued to struggle financially . " Interestingly , according to Greenberg , Obama ’s embrace of policies favored by elites who live in the country ordinary people’s incomes wealthiest zip codes did the party no favors with minority Greenberg , Obama been left behind in liberal cities like San Francisco and New York . " That is why the simple embrace of metropolitan America ’s liberal values and economic elite hurt Democrats with    voters in both the big cities and in rural America , " he notes .
