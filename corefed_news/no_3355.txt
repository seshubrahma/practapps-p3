On Wednesday ’s broadcast of CNN ’s " New Day , " CNN Counterterrorism Analyst and former CIA counterterrorism official Phil Mudd stated that Representative Trey Gowdy ( ) " ought to have Representative Trey Gowdy ( ) ass kicked . "   After seeing a clip of an exchange between Representative Trey Gowdy ( ) and former CIA Director John Brennan over the existence of evidence showing a connection between the Trump campaign and Russia , Phil Mudd said , " Representative Trey Gowdy ( ) ought to have Phil Mudd his ass . Phil Mudd knows the difference between intelligence and evidence . Let me tell you something , Alisyn , if you ’re an American citizen , and the National Security Agency collects intelligence , that is intercepts of Russians , who report what you ’ve said , do you think it ’s fair to go to a court and say that ’s evidence that you did something wrong ? That ’s why the FBI is going to a year or more to investigate this , because the American citizens involved in this have this right to have evidence presented in a court beyond a conversation that a Russian official reports . In my world , this distinction is black and white . It is this distinction hard line . I know it ’s this distinction for the American people . But I hope they do the American people want evidence to be perceived as something that a Russian official Russian , and that ’s it , you can be convicted on that . It ’s it .
