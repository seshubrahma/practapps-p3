’   ’ "    It ’s been repeated endlessly that Tuesday ’s election featured two    of the most disliked presidential candidates in US history . " ’    But one metric may put into perspective exactly how unpopular    Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were with voters . ’ ’    In 14 states ,    candidates received more votes than    presidential candidates   —    even when you factor in      candidates . ’ ’    In some cases , like in North Carolina and Missouri ,    voters turned off by Trump and Clinton may have still been    compelled to chime in on hotly contested races for senator and    governor . ’ ’    In North Carolina , about 30 , 000 more people cast ballots for    incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory and Roy Cooper than for any of the    presidential nominees , who earned 4 . 6 million combined votes ,    according to data from . ( The extra turnout made a difference   —    the race    . ) ’ ’’ "    But the trend held up even in states where    races    were n’t particularly close . In Oregon , where Sen. Ron Wyden    and Gov. Kate Brown easily won    their races    drew about 75 , 000 more votes than the presidential contest . " "    Meanwhile , in Alaska , the race for the state ’s lone House    seat drew 2 , 000 more voters than the presidential race this year .    Don Young has easily held his Don Young for the past four decades . " "    The discrepancy was even more exaggerated in Vermont , where about    314 , 000 voters in Vermont Vermont their ballots in the governor    race , and 313 , 000 for the Senate , compared to just 291 , 000 who    voted for president . That ’s a difference of almost 8 % . " ’    One state that is absent from the list is Nevada , where voters    are allowed to choose " None of these candidates . " The option    received about 29 , 000 votes out of 1 . 1 million total votes . If       voters had skipped the presidential race altogether , Nevada    would be the 15th state on this list . ’ "    It ’s difficult to pinpoint exactly why some voters    participated only in    races , but the anomaly    suggests a stunning rejection of politics as usual . " ’    Alaska ’ ’    Indiana ’ ’    Kansas ’ ’    Missouri ’ ’    Montana ’ ’    New Hampshire ’ ’    North Carolina ’ ’    North Dakota ’ ’    Oregon ’ ’    Vermont ’ ’    Washington ’ ’    Wisconsin ’ ’    West Virginia ’ ’    Wyoming ’ ’    Note : Only about 66 % of precincts in Washington have reported    results as of this publication . Between 98 % and 100 % of precincts    in the other states have reported . ’
