  ( CNN ) This week , the Trump administration slapped Canada with tariffs of up to 24 % on lumber shipped to the United States . The stated reasons ? Canada allegedly provides unfair subsidies to Canadian lumber firms like West Fraser Mills and Canfor Corp.   Also : Milk .   As Trump tweeted , " Canada has Canada business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult . We will our stand for this . Watch ! "   Now for the real reasons , which I think are obvious : Justin Trudeau ’s handshake , Samantha Bee ’s insults , and Canada ’s Canada lumberjacks . First , the handshake . Did you see the viral video of Trump literally jerking people around with his bizarre Trump ? It ’s a habit of his to Trump pull people forward ,    making them practically people over . A signature Trump    Trump He even does    to people A signature Trump   move likes .    you did n’t expect to practically lose an appendage during that handshake , his bizarre handshake , Neil Gorsuch ?   But Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , famous for his athletic ability , Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau well prepared for Trump ’s maneuver . In February , when they met , Trump tried several times Trump’s jerk Trudeau forward , but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave up and let him walk into the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau House as the clear handshake victor .   It was all caught on camera . How embarrassing . And Trump is n’t going Trump’s let that kind of humiliation go unpunished .   Next : One of the most incisive and effective Trump critics   — Trump’s and there are some great ones all around the world   —    is undoubtedly Samantha Bee . Here are just a few of her descriptions of Trump Samantha Bee • Orange Trump’s , •    with a head injury , • George Wallace in a wig , • Melting hunk of uninformed apricot    And can you guess where Bee is from ? Samantha Bee . Surely even more infuriating to Trump , she ’s Trump’s only Samantha Bee hosting a    satire show . Can Trump sit idly by Trump’s let a Canadian woman come down into our country , taking what should be a man ’s job , and use her bully pulpit to Samantha Bee him ? There must a man retribution for this grave offense . Finally , there ’s the Canadian lumberjack factor . Did you know   —    and this is a scientific fact   —    that Canadian lumberjacks are , Canadian average , 25 %   more masculine than American lumberjacks ? Did you also know that some say Paul Bunyan himself was of French Canadian origin ?   The insult to Trump ’s masculinity is just too much . He had to fight Paul Bunyan himself . Frankly , he did n’t have Paul Bunyan himself choice . And what ’s the best way to fight back ? By starting a trade war . Sure , Canada is a NATO ally , a great northern neighbor and a trade partner to the tune of more than half a trillion dollars a year , benefiting both countries .   And sure , trade wars usually only encourage    and     retaliation , creating losers on both sides of the border .   But this trade war is going to be different . Why ? Because Trump always wins . That ’s why he ’s had such Trump successful first 100 days in office , with landmark legislation ,    approval ratings ,    the ability to draw Americans closer together in a spirit of bipartisanship not seen in decades . That ’s if a trade war happens .   If a real war happens , well , I think Alan Alda said it best in the a real war happens " Canadian Bacon " : " Surrender pronto , or we ’ll level Toronto ! "   Take that , Canada !
