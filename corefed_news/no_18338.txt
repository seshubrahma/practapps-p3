" At most , the director should    have said the FBI the director and presented    its findings to federal prosecutors . the FBI    now defends his the FBI decision by asserting that he the director    Loretta    the director had a conflict . But the director FBI director is never empowered to    supplant federal prosecutors and the director the FBI Justice    Department .
