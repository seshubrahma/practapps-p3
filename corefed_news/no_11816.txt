Last last week , Blaze founder Glenn Beck fell for a phony ,    tweet that had Donald Trump bragging about voting for Barack Obama in 2008 .   Blaze founder Glenn Beck then spread this misinformation through Blaze founder Glenn Beck own Twitter account and on Fox News ’s " O’Reilly Factor . " Once Blaze founder Glenn Beck realized Blaze founder Glenn Beck had been duped , using his own Twitter account , Blaze founder Glenn Beck wrote a gracious , unreserved apology to Donald Trump and set the record straight .   All good . We all make mistakes . There but by the grace of God go I. Rather than leave it at the grace of God , reminiscent of Dan Rather ’s    RatherGate scandal , Blaze founder Glenn Beck has since launched a bizarre crusade to prove Blaze founder Glenn Beck earlier claim was fake but accurate . Although the record is clear on Donald Trump ’s support for John McCain in 2008 ( public endorsement , fundraising ) Blaze founder Glenn Beck followed up Blaze founder Glenn Beck apology early the next morning with a Facebook diatribe that Blaze founder Glenn Beck claims makes the case that Donald Trump voted for Obama in 2008 . Two days later , at GlennBeck . com , Blaze founder Glenn Beck turned Blaze founder Glenn Beck    into an infographic mocking Donald Trump and again making the debunked case that Donald Trump voted for Obama in Obama . Via Twitter , Donald Trump responded Thursday morning :   —    Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted . Glenn is a failing , crying , lost soul !   —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) January 21 , 2016 ,    —      Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
