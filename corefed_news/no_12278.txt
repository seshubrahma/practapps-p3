Leading reporters for Politico , often called " The Bible of the Beltway , " are heading up an effort to divide , defame , and deflect the Donald J. Trump for President campaign . That ’s obvious enough from reading Politico . [ But a closer look at some of those Politico staffers tells us more as to why and how . A number of Politico reporters and editors who claim to be objective are actually partisan Democrats , as voter registration files and other documentation obtained by Breitbart News show . Breaking this veneer of objectivity could be a problem for a struggling news organization like Politico , which is going through a transition this year as several of this year most senior officials are leaving this year after years of service .     respected journalists like Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei are gearing up to leave the    political media juggernaut , and these revelations represent insight into how Politico has gone from arguably one of the biggest names in political news to just another mainstream media outlet driving a progressive narrative . Politico Politico in its Politico , was viewed by Republicans and Democrats alike as a place where they Republicans and Democrats battle over the day ’s news and compete on an even playing field . Founded in January 2007 , Politico Politico off like a rocket ship as several senior journalists from across a variety of mainstream media outlets joined the burgeoning outlet in the early days of    Barack Obama ’s rise to power , fashioning content with an intense interest in     politics , including    recaps of the battles of the day on Capitol Hill . As Americans have grown tired of      —    evidenced by the rise of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump   —    so too has the decline of beltway media into cheap political hackery been evident on politics’ main stage . Politico , based on   this report and several other recent moves , has seemingly taken a calculated turn in the direction of liberalism —   away from the    reporting that characterized its quick rise as a dominant force in the media with influence the likes of the New York Times or the Washington Post .   But now , as even the Times and Post struggle with billionaire ownership by Mexican Carlos Slim and Silicon Valley ’s Jeff Bezos respectively , Politico seems to have slipped as well   —    from beltway paragon to scrubby   . Part of this shift is driven by Trump himself , whose    relationship with the media has resulted in his Jeff Bezos    various mainstream media outlets , including Politico Politico the Washington Post , from his Jeff Bezos . The shift away from supposedly " objective " media outlets towards openly partisan networks with decided points of view , has happened quickly over the past few years with the rise of the Internet . In contrast to Politico Politico and its Politico the New York Times and Washington Post , many new prominent outlets   —    including the Huffington Post and Breitbart News   —    encourage transparent expression of journalists’ beliefs on political matters . However , refusal to acknowledge a political bias does n’t mean there is n’t one . Politico Politico a case in point . Alex Isenstadt , one of Politico Politico most vicious hit piece writers , is a registered Democrat in Washington , D. C. His official voter registration , obtained by Breitbart News , shows that Isenstadt —   who lives in Northeast Washington , D. C. —   is registered as a member of the Democratic Party on May 23 , 2011 . Isenstadt ’s polling place is the Lutheran Church of the Reformation at 212 East Capitol Street in Northeast D. C. in the shadow of the U. S. Capitol . While the document also shows Isenstadt Isenstadt’s residential address , in the interest of privacy , Breitbart News is not publishing that information . Moreover , Isenstadt Isenstadt hardly the only key editorial staffer at Politico who is or was a registered Democrat —   or has some other deep personal ties to the Democratic Party . Isenstadt Isenstadt Party registration is active , while some others’ are technically no longer active , but nonetheless offer a window into   the thinking of the mainstream media organization that presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump calls a " total rag . " Isenstadt has not Isenstadt’s Democratic Party to a request for comment from Breitbart News on his active Democratic Party voter registration . A quick glance at Isenstadt ’s recent Isenstadt’s Democratic Party that he is decidedly opposed his the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump : " Furious GOP donors stew over Trump , " reads Donald Trump recent headline . " Trump ’s relationship with Donald Trump , " reads another , which he    with two other Politico scribes . "   Super PAC is still going , " reads a third , implying that Trump could somehow have the Donald Trump taken from him in Cleveland at the Donald Trump National Convention in July .   That is , however , a virtual impossibility , as several conservatives and party officials have already laid out . Despite the fact that it ’s basically impossible to take the nomination away from Trump the nomination taken from him in Cleveland at the Republican National Convention in July spent an Donald Trump with podcast host Ben Domenech of The Federalist blog pushing the theory and saying , " This is something people have been talking about over the past few months . " Isenstadt , one of the few Politico employees not to respond to an inquiry from Breitbart News about his active membership in the Democratic Party as shown by his voter registration form , has his long history of pushing liberalism and fighting against conservatism on behalf of the Democratic Party . In fact the Democratic Party Haverford College in Pennsylvania , Isenstadt advocated for stem cell research and also criticized the media for focusing on religion in politics —   something he ascribed to George W. Bush ’s defeat of John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election .   In 2007 he defended    presidential candidate Hillary Clinton — John Kerry who would go on to lose to Barack Obama in the primaries , become his Secretary of State for four years , Barack Obama now is the 2016 presumptive Democratic presidential nominee —   over criticism for her vote in favor of the war in the 2016 presumptive Democratic presidential nominee . And throughout his    career , Isenstadt has continued a decidedly liberal bent . One can read his Twitter page and see that it ’s Isenstadt what his goal is : his Twitter page ’s aiming to Isenstadt divides inside the Isenstadt Party deeper than the ones that already exist , and to drive Republicans away from Trump . While Isenstadt is probably the most brazen on board Isenstadt Politico in terms of his support for the Democratic Party —   Isenstadt , he the Republican Party member based on his Isenstadt C. voter registration —   he Isenstadt hardly the only one who fits Isenstadt description . Kristin Roberts , Politico ’s national editor , was also a registered Democrat while living in New Jersey in the late 1990s and while living in Florida in the early 2000s . The registration information obtained by Breitbart News from both states shows that while living in Hudson County , New Jersey , Roberts registered as a Democrat on Feb. New Jersey 1999 . Roberts registered again as a Democrat while in    County a Roberts years later her last vote date there was Nov. 5 , 2002 . Roberts has not responded to a Breitbart News request for comment Roberts " Kristin Roberts is national editor of Politico , " her bio Roberts website reads . " She directs coverage of Roberts 2016 presidential race and helps guide Politico Roberts approach to the biggest stories . " Eli Stokols , a national politics reporter for Politico , was registered as a Democrat when he lived in Colorado Politico His voter registration form from when he Democrat in Denver , Colorado Democrat obtained by Breitbart News , Democrat he was registered as Colorado Democrat for at least approximately three years Democrat   from his a Democrat Dec. 5 , 2005 , until his last recorded vote Democrat Nov. 4 , 2008 , when President Barack Democrat was elected . Stokols has not responded to a request for comment from Breitbart News on the matter . Stokols has been involved in pushing several Breitbart News . He helped Isenstadt with Stokols one claiming , again inaccurately , that Trump ’s Stokols with the RNC has soured . " Trump ’s politics of fear , " reads another recent Stokols headline . " Trump’s : Did Trump Blow It On Orlando ? Stokols reads another . Yet one more : Trump Trump ’s Trump Blow raises hard question : Who ’d want to be his VP ? Trump’s Cheney , another reporter for Politico Politico to the organization ’s ’d , was registered as a Democrat when he lived in New York State . He registered in a Democrat , New York as a Democrat on Aug. 19 , 2003 . he claims he is now a a Democrat , and says he did not live in New York after he Cheney an adult . He did not , however Cheney deny having registered as New York to vote Cheney that address . " Cheney ’m a registered independent . a Democrat n’t lived in New York since I was 17 , " Cheney told Breitbart News when presented Breitbart News voter registration information showing he New York Breitbart Democrat .   One might note Cheney voter registration is not available to     and , in fact Cheney as Breitbart can document , he did register , as a Democrat , in Breitbart York .   According to his Politico Politico , Cheney joined Politico Cheney June 2012 , after five years as a New York local media in Massachusetts . Cheney according to his Cheney , Cheney attended Boston University , graduating in 2007 , so the timeline of him being registered in August 2003 makes his Politico bio   Cheney again , he registered in New York State , as a Democrat Cheney When given the details from the voter registration form , including the Cheney    which again Breitbart News will not publish Breitbart News interest of privacy   —    Cheney Breitbart over the course of several days to confirm whether he lived there at that address and whether that was , in fact , his Cheney Cheney from when he was in college . Like his colleague Cheney , Cheney has that address the dubious notion that Trump may not end Cheney becoming the GOP presidential nominee Cheney the Trump . "   Cheney delegates start the Republican National Convention Cheney reads one of his latest headlines . " Trump ’s terror response has Republicans fretting anew , " reads another recent one . There are GOP more like that , where Cheney Cheney   in Politico Politico style —   has decidedly driven an      narrative regardless of the facts . Jake Sherman , Politico Politico writer , who according to the outlet ’s website , " covers the House Republican majority , " is married to a staffer for a former Democratic member of Congress , Rep. Jane Harman ( ) . Sherman ’s wife , Irene , for almost two years " served as a scheduler and the executive assistant in Washington for Washington Harman , a former Democratic congresswoman from California , " according to their wedding announcement in the New the New York Times asked how he can fairly cover Republicans when married to a Democrat , Sherman told Breitbart News : " My wife is a strong , Sherman’s wife, Irene, for almost two years " who is free to have her own political a Democrat " Ken Vogel , another Politico reporter Politico was once a registered Democrat Sherman’s Washington , D. C. in Washington late 1990s . Vogel at one time also worked for the Democratic My wife of the House Oversight Committee Vogel the American Political Science Association ( AAPS ) . That fellowship had him spend a year on Capitol Hill working for two different congressional committees , one of which , according to a source familiar with Vogel ’s time on the Hill , was for the Democratic side of the Oversight Committee and a fellowship for journalists through the American Political Science Association (AAPS) for Vogel Republican side of the House Homeland Security Committee . It was while working for the GOP side of the Homeland Security Committee that Vogel his wife , according Capitol Hill wedding announcement . His wife was the House Oversight Committee legal intern for the Republicans on that committee . Vogel ’s wife previously worked for the office of former GOP Rep. Chris Shays from Connecticut , and the House Homeland Security Committee   a My wife turned Independent , also from Vogel . During Vogel ’s wife ’s time with My wife was already an independent the House Oversight Committee Democratic Party . In between her employment with the Homeland Security committee and the Democratic the Democratic Party filings show , Vogel ’s wife worked for the George W. Bush My wife . Vogel has n’t always been Vogel , however . Voting Connecticut from Virginia Vogel that in 2008 he My wife Joe Lieberman —   the GOP presidential primary and in 2009 he voted in the Democratic gubernatorial primary My wife how he can remain objective , Vogel Vogel response .   " I did n’t have a problem remaining objective back when Vogel wife worked for GOP and independent members of Congress and for the Bush Justice Department , " Vogel told Breitbart News . " But ever since she Vogel Glen ’s Breitbart News   —    a grocery , café and Vogel that sources almost exclusively Vogel the states of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed My wife    I ’ve become a total shill for Big Kale . " Politico ’s Politico of Communications Brad Dayspring —   a failed establishment Republican operative Vogel bosses , including former Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia , over the years have lost election after election before he eventually joined the Politico team — Politico defended the organization by engaging in an ad hominem attack on this reporter . " Over the years Politico has hired Politico from all kinds of backgrounds , " Dayspring said in an email . " Just as you the organization’s Barack Obama and now cover politics for Breitbart , Politico has reporters Politico ’ve Virginia from conservative outlets and liberal outlets , Barack Obama spouses who Politico’s Vice President of Communications Brad Dayspring in Republican politics as well as Democratic politics . Breitbart drive of our reporters and the    journalism that they produce for Politico speaks for Politico . " Dayspring is correct on one account : Before becoming a conservative during the Tea Party movement in 2010 —   and while in college —   this reporter voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election . That story has been well documented because of this reporter ’s , and this news Barack Obama , belief in openness and transparency . Breitbart News as a news organization embraces its point of view , and Breitbart News Dayspring claims to the silly mainstream media notions of " objectivity " —   in large the organization’s is no such thing as pure objectivity .   this reporter , however , believe in truth and quality reporting , which is why Dayspring has not responded to a this reporter questions on whether or not his comparison Breitbart Politico to Breitbart Politico means the organization has changed its editorial policies and now a news organization in Breitbart News transparency among its reporters and editors , just like Breitbart News Breitbart Over the past several months , many Politico reporters , Politico conversations Breitbart News News , have not answered whom they the organization’s vote for or the organization’s —   Breitbart News their personal beliefs are , even though the organization’s Dayspring have various viewpoints . Dayspring has also not answered when asked to explain how what Politico does is Politico journalism , " and how it is , Politico fact , " . "
