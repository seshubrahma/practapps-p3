An    poll released Friday shows Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump tied at 37 percent support in a    race that also includes Gary Johnson and Jill Stein . [ Donald Trump remains only one percent behind Hillary Clinton in a     matchup , 43 to 44 percent . Those who " strongly " supported him rose from 47 percent to 50 percent , while Hillary Clinton ’s strong support fell from 51 percent to 44 percent .   Half of those polled also backed mandatory deportations for illegal aliens in the U. S. and 46 percent supported Trump ’s border wall . Forty percent also supported ending the practice of automatically granting citizenship to anyone born in the U. S. Significantly , 22 percent of Democrats support building a wall , while 28 percent and 27 percent support the end of automatic birthright citizenship for illegal aliens’ children and mandatory deportations for those in the U. the U.

The contrast between Trump ’s and Clinton ’s immigration policies could n’t be more stark . Clinton wants to abolish Clinton S. immigration enforcement and dissolve the nation ’s borders and legalize all 30    illegal aliens within 100 days of taking office . Dangerous illegal aliens would not be deported until after they committed a crime Dangerous illegal aliens if then , since she would halt almost Clinton deportations . Illegal entry into the U. S. would not be considered a " deportable offense " under a Clinton administration , which is a key tenet of the    creed : " Namely , that millions of people can illegally come to the country , take jobs , attend U. S. schools , receive affirmative action , apply for federal benefits , and give birth to children who receive birthright citizenship . " It ’s likely a Clinton administration would also Clinton with Republicans to increase already ahistorical and extreme levels of legal immigration . Refugee resettlement from    Islamic nations would also dramatically increase over the objections of American communities .

S. by the Obama administration would be the first ones expelled from the U. S. He the U. S. administration would the U. S. a wall the Obama administration U. S.   border illegal aliens caught crossing into U.

Immigration policy and trade have played a major role in the 2016 election as Americans’ opposition to mass migration remains high . Pew Research found 72 percent of whites , 66 percent of blacks , and 59 percent of Hispanics support measures to   " restrict and control " immigration .
