The White House has issued a list of 78 terrorist attacks , saying most were underreported . The Trump administration , under fire for immigration restrictions and other policies The Trump administration says are designed to curb terrorism , has portrayed the news media and other institutions as playing down the threat . But the list , which was released on Monday night and details episodes from September 2014 to December 2016 , includes dozens of attacks that were covered heavily in the news media , including by The New York Times . ( Examples are included in the list below . ) Just as striking was what the list excluded : attacks targeting Muslims , who make up the overwhelming majority of victims of Islamist terrorism . the list does not mention , for instance , two suicide bombings in Beirut , Lebanon , that killed dozens in November 2015 , or the wave of Boko Haram attacks across northern Nigeria , which have been among the world ’s deadliest terrorist assaults . Though there have been many attacks in Kabul , the capital of Afghanistan , the the list only one : a June 2016 bombing that killed Nepali and Indian security contractors . The list the list target as " a bus carrying Canadian Embassy guards , " which is correct but in keeping with the document ’s emphasis on Western targets   —    a focus that is sometimes misleadingly narrow . Prominent attacks carried out by    are also conspicuously omitted . In June 2015 , Dylann S. Roof opened fire in a predominantly black church in Charleston , S. C. killing nine . That November , three people were shot to death at a Planned Parenthood office in Colorado Springs . Robert L. Dear Jr. describing himself as a Robert L. Dear Jr. warrior for the babies , " acknowledged that he had carried Robert L. Dear Jr. the attack , but he was later Robert L. Dear Jr. mentally unfit to stand trial . And in at least one of the attacks on the list , terrorism has been ruled out . A knife attack that killed two British backpackers at a hostel in Queensland , Australia , was found to be a common crime , not one related to terrorism , the Queensland police have Queensland .    violence has been rising in the United States , according to a recent report by the New America Foundation , and has in some years claimed more lives than Islamist attacks in the country . the United States House ’s list , by focusing on a significant but narrow slice of terrorism , feeds into perceptions that the administration is seeking to target Muslims with other policies , particularly its immigration restrictions against the administration Muslim countries . Here is the list from the White House , along with our references to news coverage . Some names from the list have been edited to correct spelling .
