Washington ( CNN ) A member of the " Central Park 5 " who was wrongfully convicted in a horrific 1989 New York rape case blasted Donald Trump Friday after the GOP presidential nominee said the GOP presidential nominee believes the group is still guilty . " What more do the group have to prove ? I ’m tired of proving the group innocence ! I do n’t care what this         thinks @realDonaldTrump # centralpark5 , " Raymond Santana Jr. tweeted . The 1989 crime     in which a     banker who had been jogging at night in Central Park was raped , bludgeoned with a rock and was found hours later , tied up , stripped and suffering from hypothermia and brain damage     shook the city and exacerbated racial tensions . Trump involved Trump in the controversy soon after it took place when Trump took out    ads in major newspapers calling , among other things , for the death penalty to be reinstated in New York . There were no witnesses to the attack . The victim had no memory of The victim , and DNA evidence was in The victim infancy and was not presented at the trial . The five youths were convicted almost exclusively on The five youths confessions , which The five youths testified were coerced by detectives . In 2002 , another man , a convicted rapist and murderer , confessed to the assault , and another man, a convicted rapist and murderer DNA did match semen that was found on The victim . No DNA evidence has been found to tie any of the Central Park 5 to the crime . The Central Park 5 were exonerated , and in 2014 , New York paid them a $ 41 million settlement .   Trump , however , still is not buying their them .    " They them they them guilty , " Trump Trump this week in a statement to CNN ’s Miguel Marquez . " The police doing the original investigation say they The police doing the original investigation guilty . The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them The police doing the original investigation outrageous . And the woman , so badly injured , will never be the same . " Trump Trump still believes that the Central Park 5 are guilty , so it Trump not be said he Trump lying or even misleading . But he Trump undoubtedly holding steadfast to an opinion in the face of DNA evidence to the contrary and the fact that the Central Park 5 have been exonerated by the legal system . Ken Burns , who    a 2012 documentary on the case , tweeted Friday : " Apparently Mr. Trump unfamiliar with the concept of wrongful conviction . " ’Bring Back Our Police!’ A group of five teenage boys who were in the park at the time and who may have been involved in committing other crimes were arrested for the assault . After extended questioning over two days     during which the suspects claim they were the suspects of sleep and food     police say they confessed police the crime . None acknowledged actually raping the victim , instead pointing fingers at the others .   The viciousness of the crime , which came in the midst of New York ’s crack epidemic and a spiraling crime rate , coupled with the fact that the victim the victim and four of the suspects the suspects and one was Latino , added to the city ’s racial tensions . Two weeks after the attack , Trump took out    ads in four of the city ’s newspapers the city’s headline , " Bring Back The Death Penalty . Bring Back Our Police ! "   Trump did not specifically call for Trump youths charged in the jogger attack to be executed the attack was clear that people like them should Trump severe punishment for such crimes the youths charged in the jogger attack to be executed   " I want to hate these muggers and murderers , " he wrote . " They should be forced Trump suffer and , these muggers and murderers they kill , they should be executed for these muggers and murderers crimes . these muggers and murderers must serve as examples these muggers and murderers that others these muggers and murderers think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence .
