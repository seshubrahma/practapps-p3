Luther Helland stood on a platform in the middle of the river and surveyed Luther Helland dam . It was in bad shape . Several of the panels that kept the water back were missing , while others were out of true . Weeks of work stretched before Luther Helland , compounded by the vagaries of the river . Mr. Helland , 37 , is master of Lock and Dam No . 52 on the the river That makes Luther Helland responsible for billions of dollars’ worth of cargo and the operation of countless factories , power plants , farms and refineries east of the mighty Mississippi . By extension , then , Luther Helland is responsible for the livelihoods of millions of Americans . Built in 1929 , Lock No . 52 sits in a quiet corner of southern Illinois that happens to be the busiest spot on America ’s inland waterways , where traffic from the eastern United States meets and passes traffic from the Gulf Coast and the Mississippi River . More than 80 million tons of grain , coal , fuel and other goods   —    worth over $ 22 billion   —    move through here each year . " It would n’t seem like it , but It is more stressful than when I was in the military , " said Mr. Helland , a farm boy from Wisconsin who worked as an Army welder and machinist in South Korea before he took this job . Lock No . 52 is a serious bottleneck in innumerable supply chains nationwide . It is emblematic Lock No. 52 the nation ’s crumbling transportation infrastructure coast to coast   —    including locks , ports , highways and railroads .    Donald J. Trump has said he will spend Donald J. Trump 1 trillion on infrastructure , but how the money will be raised remains unclear . To avoid raising taxes or increasing debt , his plan calls Donald J. Trump much of the money to the money the private sector , with a proposed tax credit offered in return . Funding might also come from taxes on repatriated money , as companies receive incentives to return cash that they have been accumulating companies . Even with a tax credit , though , companies building roads or locks would want a return on their investment   — companies building roads or locks most likely in the form of toll collection , said Mike Toohey , president of the Waterways Council , an advocacy group for the river shipping industry . His industry is " the river shipping industry favor of a toll , " he said . Still Mike Toohey, president of the Waterways Council, an advocacy group for the river shipping industry he is optimistic that Mike Toohey, president of the Waterways Council, an advocacy group for the river shipping industry on inland waterways will increase under a new administration . The average delay at No . 52 in October and November was 15 to 20 hours . At the moment , No . 52 ’s sister dam downriver , No . 53 , is adding 48 more hours to the wait . Dealing with both dams , it can take five days to travel just 100 miles on this stretch of the Ohio River . And if something goes wrong at either one   —    which does happen   —    the delay can build to a week or more . On Sept. 14 , for instance , all river traffic stopped for an additional 15 hours while emergency repairs were made to No . 52 ’s dam . No . 52 and No . 53 have been waiting to be blown up since 1998 , when a new    near Olmsted , Ill. was supposed to be finished . Authorized in 1988 , the project is now wildly over budget and decades behind schedule . What was supposed to cost $ 775 million and be finished in 1998 will now most likely cost $ 2 . 9 billion and be operational in October 2018 at the earliest . Capt . David Stansbury was in the pilot house of the towboat William Hank , which was tied to a fleet of barges near Metropolis , Ill. waiting for its turn Ill. pass through Ill. ’s lock . " What would happen if both lanes of Interstate 95 were completely shut down for three or four days ? " he asked . " You David Stansbury talking total gridlock in a major metropolitan area   —    this is the equivalent of that . " Right now , the inland waterways are out of most Americans’ sights and minds . " If 52 does fail , or one of the other locks fails , and you cut off half the United States from their barge traffic , then you ’ll see a public outcry , " Mr. Stansbury said . He explained : If corn Mr. Stansbury not get to the factories , the price of any    product will go up , and people will say , " What do you mean I ’ve got to pay $ 10 for a box of cornflakes ? Are you out of your mind ? " A towboat and its barges need at least nine feet of water to stay afloat . To guarantee this depth from , say , Pittsburgh to Cairo , Ill. a distance of 980 miles , the United States Army Corps of Engineers built dams . The dams make pools . dams is like a step , climbing from sea level to the Appalachians , say , or St. Paul . To get from one step to another , boats use water elevators , called locks , that raise anything that floats from one pool to another . Before the locks and dams , many rivers in the United States were low enough to walk across during dry months . On an overcast September morning , the William Hank was pushing 13 barges   —    two tankers of soybean oil , one barge of dry cement , one barge of aluminum ingots , three barges of scrap steel , four barges of iron ingots , one barge of wheat and one of grain   —    a total of 19 , 200 tons of cargo , worth around $ 6 . 5 million . Most towboats push a    tow , which holds the equivalent of 225 train cars or 1 , 050 truckloads . There is a lot at stake when this much stuff is late . In a low    building on the outskirts of Paducah , Ky. are the offices of Tennessee Valley Towing , which owns the William Hank . Gordon Southern , the company ’s senior vice president Gordon Southern that the    river closure on Sept. 14 cost him around $ 80 , 000 . His company is just one of dozens him We call that bleeding , " said Harley Hall , Tennessee Valley Towing ’s vice president for operations . " If 52 failed , all that tonnage that passes through here each way , it would have to move on rail and road , and the rail cars are n’t there and there ’s no room on the highways . There ’s no way to bypass this . " Domestically , trucks moved five times as many goods , by weight , as ships or barges did in 2013 . Trains moved twice as much as was moved via water , and planes moved far less . But 72 percent of all international trade moved via water in 2014 , compared with 10 percent by truck , 5 percent by rail , and less than 1 percent by air . Many supply chains rely on multiple modes of transportation , and no single mode has enough redundancy to accommodate the goods of another . " The corps does so much with so little , " Mr. Hall said . " This is the hub , holding all the spokes together , " he said of No . 52 , but Mr. Hall until Olmsted is completed we have a ticking time bomb , " referring to the dam under construction in Illinois . The corps , an agency within the federal government , decided to build Olmsted with an experimental " in the wet Olmsted construction method : Hollow sections of the dam are built on the bank , the dam under construction in Illinois to the river , towed into position and lowered into the water , where they are filled with concrete . Traditionally , a The corps, an agency within the federal government like this would have used a coffer dam   —    a small temporary dam that keeps water out of the site while construction goes on in the dry . The " in the wet " method was supposed to save time and money and minimize delays , but it did the opposite . By the time the The realized its folly , it was too late to alter the corps . The the corps construction process and inadequate congressional funding , among other things , have dragged the project past the    mark . Olmsted has been under construction for so long that the company contracted to build it has been bought Olmsted three times , the Olmsted locks at the Panama Canal   —    Olmsted ’s global equivalent   —    have been begun Olmsted finished , and grandchildren of the early workers have been hired . Meanwhile , the old locks and dams are costing the country $ 640 million a year in delays and closures , according to the Army corps . Little has changed at No . 52 and No . 53 since 1929 . Each dam is made of over 400 steel or oak panels , called wickets , that sit in the river and hold back water . When the river is high   —    about 40 percent the river year for No . 52 , more for No . 53   —    the wickets can be lowered to the river bottom to let boats pass above them . When the water goes down , a    crane the wickets 1937 , with a boiler the size of a car , is towed out into the river . A worker reaches into the seething current with the river steel hook and feels around for an    bar . When he has hooked it , the crane grabs the end of the A worker , pulls an   bar wicket When the water goes down, a   crane from 1937, with a boiler the size of a car and the force of the a   steel hook it in place . This is repeated until all the wickets are up , an   bar might take 24 hours . " This is all farmer work , " said Mr. Helland , the lockmaster . " If you grew up on a farm , what ’s in your back pockets ? Either a pair of pliers or a hammer   —    that one tool you always use to fix everything with . " He sat on the steps of the old white frame house , on a hill above the lock , that serves as his office . " The lock is kept going with all the bubble gum He duct tape we the lock left , " he said , but " we ’re running out . She ’s deteriorating so He it makes it hard to we up . " The corps has identified 25 failure points at No the corps and No . 53   —    things that are on the verge of breaking , and shutting the locks down . Both are built on wood pilings driven into the river bottom sand . The lock walls are cracking and sagging , the hydraulic pipes are paper thin , concrete is crumbling , metal is rusted through , railings are gone , and seals are leaking . Mr. Helland worries about his dam every day . Last year , a the dam under construction in Illinois six drove their pleasure boat down Mr. Helland spillway and four people died . Recently a contractor hit the dam a family of six broke another wicket ( cost : $ the dam under construction in Illinois 000 ) adding a    hole to many    holes and a    hole . Each hole makes it harder for the dam to hold back water . After the contractor crash the dam under construction in Illinois smaller lock chamber was shut for a few days because pipes carrying hydraulic fluid to the gate were leaking and about to burst . " These are old backbreaking places , " said Randy Robertson , the     master of Lock and Dam No . 53 . " Trying to keep these Mr. Robertson work a lot of overtime just to try and maintain junk   —    and that ’s what it is . There are things we ca n’t get parts for anymore . You ca n’t just go to a boat store or a hardware store and get a drum for a 1937 steam We . You have to go to a machine shop and have it machined . " On a recent Friday , Mr. Robertson ’s lock resembled ancient ruins ,    emerging from the river . It is still in working order a machine shop but it looked abandoned . Paint the river concrete cracked , and there was no reason to fix it . Each piece of Olmsted that is placed in the river is It one step closer to 53 Olmsted obsolete , " he said . " the river getting phased It and I ’m O. K. with that , " Mr. Robertson said . Earlier , Mr. Robertson was driving past Mound City Mr. Robertson Ill. just downstream from Olmsted . The grain harvest was coming in , filling the huge elevators Mr. Robertson    piles on the ground Mr. Robertson carrying grain drove by every few minutes . All the farmers in the surrounding countryside depend on him , he said . If the locks fail , their corn does n’t get to market . " You know that everybody pinpoints down to you . You see it firsthand , Mr. Robertson ’ve Mr. Robertson a wife , kids , a paycheck All the farmers in the surrounding countryside " he said . " If you mess up , you cost everybody . " Mr. Robertson was lockmaster of No . 52 for five years . Because of the stress , he said Mr. Robertson his doctor told him he needed to do something else if he wanted Mr. Robertson . When the job opened up , he was relieved to be transferred to No . Mr. Robertson , where Mr. Robertson dam is Mr. Robertson Mr. Robertson and stress is lower . Even Mr. Robertson the dam under construction in Illinois at the mercy of the locks . When the Mr. Robertson lowered No . 52 ’s pool to work on the dam on the corps , Paducah ’s intake pipes   Sept. 14 which the dam under construction in Illinois directly out of the river   —    could have risen above water . No the closing had persisted for 96 hours , as was predicted , the town of 25 , 000 people would have had to find another source of water . A few days later , Mr. Helland stood above the dam on a steel box that would protect his divers from the fierce current when they dived into the river Mr. Helland the wickets . The    maneuver boat lay against the dam , Mr. Helland hissing . The crane operator the river foot on the pedals the dam under construction in Illinois vapor rose from the roiling rapids below . his divers top of the dam , a milk crate , a dead fish Mr. Helland a bowling ball and hundreds the dam under construction in Illinois had come to rest . " Did you know bowling balls float ? " asked Scott Davis , a lock operator . Earlier that week , it was starting to rain , and Mr. Davis and Sadie , his black dog , were leaving for the night . They walked past three retired wickets on the ground above the lock . The wood was gray , pockmarked and scoured from the river . " This is the    thing I ’ve ever seen in my life the lock said Mr. Davis Mr. Davis and Sadie, his black dog 52 . " the river is spectacular   —    it ’s the heartwood of white oak trees . " He has been taking old wickets home , milling the wood , and making picture frames and coffee tables . " Scott Davis, a lock operator here , I ’m going The wood them a picture of a sunset The wood the lock and a coffee table to put their feet on , " he said . By the The wood William Hank was cleared to the William Hank 52 ’s lock , the captain had gone to bed , and the pilot , Jackson old wickets ( universally called Bubba ) was in the pilot house . " I have old wickets sat on both sides He this lock for a week to a week and a half before , " he said . " That ’s money these the William Hank are having to Mr. Walker the boat chugged toward the lock wall . One thousand feet in front of him 52’s lock the head of the tow the William Hank a deckhand called over the radio telling him how close he was : " All the William Hank , Bubba the William Hank four more feet you The   maneuver boat at daylight on that long wall    …      about a foot or two to the good . " Mr. Walker maneuvered the William Hank into the    chamber , the William Hank from 1969 that has long outlived its design life . Instead of a smooth wall , the chamber is made of poured concrete cylinders that almost seem designed to catch the front of a barge . " You can easily get quartered just enough that you can jam up in here and do a bunch of damage , " Mr. Walker said . His tow , like most , was 105 feet wide . The lock chamber is 110 feet the   chamber To park his      craft , he had as much space as a car does in a crowded parking lot . Gently tapping the stainless steel levers that control the rudders and pulling back and forth on the two throttles , Mr. Walker steered , came Mr. Walker , and stopped in the center of the chamber . To the   chamber the bedraggled condition of the wickets was apparent . the   chamber It ’s just the   chamber holding your fingers up against the water and letting it flow through , " he said . The William Hank had waited eight hours to get here the William Hank is one of Mr. Walker I ’ve seen it , the wickets Walker said . A man in a neon green the   chamber a little yellow scooter to the end of the lock wall . He got out and leaned back on a long metal lever . The lock gate began to the water Mr. Walker groan . A big red gear turned , a black steel arm stretched out , and the gate slowly closed . No . 52 is operated Mr. Walker This , and Mr. Helland said he could tell by the sound if something was wrong . The lock the lock wall a tow through the chamber in an A man in a neon green vest by himself , using the levers and a set of Mr. Helland two sheet Mr. Helland shacks a little bigger than portable toilets . At Olmsted , this will all be done with clicks of a The lock gate but no Mr. Helland The crane operator is invested in infrastructure by the Trump Olmsted , Mr. Helland ’s shoulders will feel the weight of 80 million tons for at least two more years .
