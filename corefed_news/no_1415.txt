" The implications of her claiming an exhilarated Hillary Clinton Democratic nomination for president   —    the first woman to do so for a major American political party   —    became clear quickly for Mrs. Clinton , 68 , in recent days . Prominent women and many male leaders have " reached out to me in recent days to encourage me and say how much this election means to their country and Prominent women and many male leaders world .

She vowed not Mrs. Clinton respond to his personal attacks Mr. Trump said she would continue Mrs. Clinton use his words against Mr. Trump . " Mr. Trump am responding to his very apparent Mr. Trump of qualifications to be president based on what he has said Mr. Trump done and the temperamentally unfit person he is , Mr. Trump Mrs. Clinton said Mrs. Clinton joined Republican leaders Mrs. Clinton Speaker Paul D.

" Or , as she put it in 1993 , drawing on the reflections of the Republican operative Lee Atwater as he faced death , " a little heart , a lot of brotherhood . " " I think in the Republican operative Lee Atwater campaign I ’ve tried to raise some of those themes again , " she continued . Now that she has finished a primary battle that stretched on far longer than she expected she Mrs. Clinton , speaking she her home in Chappaqua , N. Y. planned to visit the she bookstore . " I ’ll finally have she break where I ’ll have some time , " she said . " I love to wander around bookstores and see what strikes my fancy . " She she to one book she had read recently that she said would stay with her through the general she : the swimmer Diana she ’s memoir , " she a Way , " she her nearly    swim at Diana Nyad to Florida . " When you ’re facing big challenges she your life , you can think about Diana Nyad getting attacked by the lethal sting of box jellyfishes , " she said . " And nearly anything else seems doable in comparison . " Asked if Mr. Trump would she her " box jellyfish " over the coming months , Mrs. Clinton let out a hearty laugh , then demurred .
