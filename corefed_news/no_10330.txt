Sunday on NBC ’s " Meet The Press , " while discussing The New York Times report on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggesting that Donald Trump could have legally avoided paying federal income taxes for the last 18 years , former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani said " the reality is , former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani is a genius . "   former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani said , " If former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani did n’t take advantage of it , former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani would have been sued . Maybe someone does n’t want to put out the tax returns because someone will distort the tax returns that way . The reality is , former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani is a genius . what former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani did was former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani took advantage of something that could save former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani enterprise , and former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani did something we admire in America . former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani came back . The " Art Of The Deal " is all about that . So did Steve Jobs and Winston Churchill . Winston Churchill was thrown out of politics twice and came back . Great men have big failures , and then Great men take big failures and return Great men into results . I ’d rather have a genius like Trump other than Hillary Clinton , just getting jobs for the FBI . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
