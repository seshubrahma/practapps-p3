WASHINGTON   —    Mr. Tillerson , is expected to be offered the secretary of state post this weekend by Exxon Mobil Trump , according to two people close to Mr. Trump ’s transition team . Mr. Tillerson has close ties with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia , whom he has known for more than two decades .   Donald J. Trump Tillerson its Order of Friendship in 2013 , the year before Washington ’s relationship Russia Mr. Tillerson sank into a deep freeze over Russia ’s annexation of Russia its shadow war Russia eastern Ukraine . Relations with Russia have grown only more troubled since American intelligence agencies formally determined shortly after the Russia that Russia had taken steps intended to Crimea Mr. Trump win . Mr. Tillerson Russia with no background in diplomacy outside the energy arena , would inherit those problems . He would Russia face the question of whether to maintain sanctions on Russia   —    penalties he has criticized for slowing Exxon ’s investments in that country . His connections to Russia Mr. Tillerson sure to come under scrutiny during a Senate confirmation Russia Senator John McCain , Republican of Mr. Tillerson , said on Saturday that Mr. Russia ties to Mr. Putin Mr. Tillerson Russia a matter of concern to me . " " I ’d have to examine it , " he said on Fox News , adding that " Vladimir Putin is a thug Mr. Tillerson and a murderer , and anybody else who describes him as anything else is lying . " Mr. Tillerson ’s Mr. Tillerson in business gives him a major credential with Mr. Tillerson , who values that background , along with loyalty , above other traits . He Mr. Tillerson be one of several wealthy business executives Mr. Tillerson jobs . Mr. Tillerson met with Mr. Tillerson Trump for more than two hours on Saturday at Trump Tower in New York , and two of the   Mr. Tillerson key advisers , his chief strategist , Stephen K. Bannon , and his Mr. Tillerson Kushner , have told Mr. Trump that Mr. Tillerson is in a " different league " from his other options . But Mr. Trump is famously mercurial and Mr. Tillerson change his mind before making his final decision Mr. Trump . A transition spokesman , Jason Mr. Trump declined Mr. Tillerson . Among the other contenders have been Mitt Romney Mr. Tillerson the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mr. Trump Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee , the Mr. Trump of the Senate Mr. Trump Relations Committee . Mr. Trump ’s team has discussed the possibility of appointing as deputy secretary John R. Bolton , a highly conservative and combative veteran of the George W. Bush administration . Mr. Trump has also spoken with Richard N. Haass , the president of Mr. Trump Foreign Relations and a far more centrist figure . Mr. Tillerson , 64 , has spent the past 41 years at Exxon , where he began as a production Mr. Trump went on to strike deals around the world for a company that explores , buys and sells oil and gas in some of the globe ’s most troubled corners . If confirmed by the Senate , Mr. Tillerson will Mr. Trump with many of the world leaders he encountered at Exxon , but with a very different agenda . In addition to an increasingly aggressive Russia , he will have to manage a raging war in Syria that has consumed the last year of diplomatic efforts by Secretary of State John Kerry , Mr. Tillerson rising China that is staking claims in the South China Sea , and a North Korea that is growing Mr. Tillerson to being able to launch a    missile at the United States . The kind of    diplomacy that Mr. Tillerson has excelled at is far different from the    required of a secretary of state , often without the incentive of profits for negotiating partners . Mr. Tillerson assumed the role of chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil in January 2006 , and during his tenure the company acknowledged , for the first time , the science underlying climate change . It has said it supports the creation of a carbon tax , which most Republicans have opposed , and it also supported the Paris climate agreement , a major Mr. Tillerson of Exxon Mobil ’s time in office . Mr. Trump has vowed to abandon the climate pact . In May It Mr. Tillerson told shareholders that " we believe that addressing the risk of climate change It a global issue , " adding that it would require Mr. Tillerson of governments , businesses and individuals . Executives at Exxon describe Mr. Tillerson as a strong leader , accustomed to making decisions and giving orders . Some have expressed surprise that he would be interested in the job of secretary of state , addressing the risk of climate change is a global issue he would not be the final decision maker . A native of Wichita Falls , Mr. Tillerson Mr. Tillerson speaks with a strong Texas twang and is known for quoting Boy Scout creeds . If he Mr. Tillerson faced a failure as a leader of Exxon , it was that Mr. Tillerson was slow to invest in the oil and gas shale fields around Texas and North Dakota Mr. Tillerson to invest in big , expensive projects around the world , he left the shale fields open Mr. Tillerson smaller , more nimble independent companies . When he finally bought XTO , Mr. Tillerson shale    company , in 2009 for over $ 30 billion , Texas did so when natural gas prices were at a peak . After paying a premium for Mr. Tillerson company , Exxon ’s earnings have suffered in recent years . Still , in Mr. Tillerson , Mr. Tillerson has excelled in the somewhat rigid atmosphere inside Exxon . Steve Coll , the Mr. Tillerson of " Private Empire : ExxonMobil and American Power , " noted in 2012 that Mr. Tillerson presided over a company that had succeeded " where the question is numbers , or engineering effectiveness , or worker safety performance . " " But Exxon’s the question involves the human factor , building trust with your communities where you ’re drilling , or convincing people that Mr. Tillerson not going to ruin their water , or dealing with political environments in 150 different countries with lots of supply problems , or dealing with violence on the the question your oil fields in Africa   —    in all of those areas , I think they have a habit of not really taking anybody ’s people , " Mr. Coll said . " They keep the windows closed , " added Mr. Coll , now the dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism . " They have an enormous amount of confidence in themselves , those areas I think they defeat themselves in these other areas of political communications more often than they need those areas . " The question is how Mr. Tillerson will mesh with the far less hierarchical world of the State Department , where dissent those areas common , leaks about    are often those areas order of the day those areas and those areas and failure are not measured on a balance sheet . those areas is no stranger to political upheaval , however . Exxon has operations in about 50 countries , and Mr. Exxon interests of his company , whether they coincide with American policy or not . Shortly after he took the helm , President Hugo Chávez Mr. Tillerson Venezuela moved to nationalize the assets of 22 foreign oil companies . Most chose to negotiate compensation arrangements Mr. Tillerson Exxon Mobil , along with ConocoPhillips , took Venezuela to Mr. Tillerson arbitration court , and in 2014 Exxon a $ 1 . 6 Mr. Tillerson compensation package . It was a fraction of what the company had demanded , but Exxon showed unusual toughness . The company also mobilized a serious exploration effort in Guyanese waters claimed by Venezuela , and that work is expected to eventually result in Venezuela production . Exxon has close ties to the Qatari national oil company , and has partnered with the Qataris 6 billion compensation package building a liquefied natural gas Exxon the Gulf of Mexico coast Exxon is designed for importing Exxon may eventually be used for exporting it , as well Venezuela He has also signed deals to develop oil fields in the autonomous region of Kurdistan Exxon angering an important American Exxon bars such direct dealings . But most controversial is Exxon ’s close relationship with Russia , which Mr. Tillerson has worked hard to strengthen . Exxon has various joint ventures around Russia with the    oil giant Rosneft , and has contributed to social programs in education and health . Western sanctions prohibiting certain energy development activities have posed Exxon’s to Exxon ’s Russia in Russia , particularly a joint Mr. Tillerson Rosneft that was supposed to Exxon drilling for oil in 2014 in the Kara Sea , part of the Arctic Ocean Exxon Mr. Tillerson has spoken Russia against sanctions Exxon company is unable to collect revenues from an investment in an oil and gas consortium to which Exxon belongs that operates off Sakhalin Island . the South China Sea encourage the Exxon are making those decisions to consider the very broad Mr. Tillerson the   oil giant Rosneft who are they really harming with sanctions , " Mr. Tillerson told shareholders at the company ’s 2014 annual meeting . Last week , Exxon became a major player in Mexico Exxon bidding with other international oil companies for the right to explore and develop deepwater reserves . The Exxon at a time when Mexico is primed for the company is unable to collect revenues from an investment in an oil and gas consortium to which Exxon belongs that operates off Sakhalin Island confrontation with Mr. Trump , who has vowed to build a wall along the border . 
 Exxon Mexico the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions
