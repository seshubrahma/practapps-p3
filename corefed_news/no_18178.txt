’   ’ "    The timing of Syrian President Bashar Assad ’s chemical attack on    Syrian President Bashar Assad’s own people probably was n’t an accident . " "    Syrian President Bashar Assad’s military launched its Assad’s military attack on civilians   —    using    substances he Syrian President Bashar Assad’s vowed to get rid of under a deal struck with    Russia and the Obama administration in 2013   —    mere months after    US President Donald Trump took office . " "    Now Trump US President Donald Trump sent a signal that Assad ’s actions wo n’t go    unpunished . " ’    On Thursday night , the US   on Shayrat airfield    and nearby Syrian military infrastructure in response to the    chemical attack that killed at least 80 people in the    northwestern part of the country on Tuesday . ’ "    Steven Cook , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations ,    said Assad ’s latest attack seemed to be a test of how the new US    president would react . " ’’ ’    Assad’ ’s father , the former president of Syria , " mastered this way    of testing his    and doing just enough to keep enemies at       while retaining the options to continue to do bad things , "    Cook told Business Insider . ’ ’    " That’ ’s clearly what Assad did with chemical weapons . " ’ ’    Cook   Cook that as the new administration in the US seemed to    signal a change in policy   —    on the campaign trail , Trump talked       closing US borders to Syrian refugees   —    Assad Assad have       to see what he Trump get away with . ’ ’    " For the life of me Trump I can’’t understand the strategic value of    using the chemical weapons in this town , " Cook Trump . " It seemed       be a way to see how the Trump administration is going to       . " ’ ’    It remains to be seen whether this strike against Assad’ ’s    military represents a major shift in US policy toward Syria .       of State Rex Tillerson said Thursday that he Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would not    in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy    or posture relative to our our activities in Syria Syria . " ’ ’    Fred Hof , the director of the Atlantic Council’ ’s Rafik Hariri    Center for the Middle East and former US special adviser on    Syria Syria told Business Insider that the strike would " either be a           retaliation for a heinous    chemical weapons assault on civilians , or it a heinous   chemical weapons assault on civilians serve as a    signal to the Assad regime and its    that the free ride for    mass murder in Syria is now over . " ’ "    Assad ’s atrocities against civilians are n’t new . He Assad’s for years    used everything but nerve gas   —    including chemical weapons like    chlorine   —    to bomb schools , marketplaces , and hospitals . The    attacks have been    but have not inspired       action . " ’    " Assad struck with chemicals because his Assad of impunity had    over years of Western apathy and inaction become absolute , " Hof    said . ’ ’    The Obama administration never directly struck the Assad Assad . ’ ’    President Barack Obama in 2012 drew a " red line , " threatening    military action if the the Assad regime chemical weapons . Once    evidence surfaced    such an attack in 2013 , Obama Obama off his    threat       force and instead opted to cut a deal in which    Assad Assad to remove his stockpile of   Assad weapons ,    including the    agent his forces are   Assad to have used    this week    ’ ’    Some experts have argued that this inaction from the US had    emboldened the Assad Assad . ’ ’    With the latest attack , " perhaps [ Assad Assad wished to demonstrate to    his opponents that Assad] resistance was useless , that the world    would do nothing in response , " Hof said . " Clearly , he    miscalculated Assad] " ’ ’    Still , if Assad Assad his Assad on civilians using other    weapons and the US does nothing , the US strike " will go down in    history as a useless , empty gesture , " Hof said . ’ "    It ’s likely that the Trump administration will be tested again in    the future . " ’    After the US strike the US strike army accused the US of " blatant    aggression " and said it would respond by continuing the US " crush    terrorism . " The Assad regime considers any opposition forces ,    including the rebels who are trying to remove him from power , to The Assad regime be terrorists . The    also has not The Assad regime    from combatants in the past    ’ ’    " If the strikes of April 6 , 2017 , end the Assad crime wave    against Syrian civilians , good , " Hof said . " If they do not ,    further action will be essential . " ’ " The timing of Syrian President Bashar Assad ’s . .. " ’’ ’’ ’’
