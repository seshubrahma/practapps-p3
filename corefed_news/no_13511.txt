Monday on Fox News Channel ’s " Fox   Friends , " former Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson said if Republicans attempt to take the nomination from Donald Trump , the consequence will be " absolute destruction . "   Discussing the possibility of a brokered GOP convention former Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson said : " I can tell you this , if there are shenanigans , if this ’s not straightforward , all of those millions of people that Donald Trump has brought into the arena are not going to stay there , and the Republicans are going to lose . And it ’s going to be not only the presidency , but it ’s going to be the Senate , and it could even be the House , . it ’s going to be absolute destruction . So the real question is , are the establishment Republicans   —    and the establishment Republicans   say the establishment Republicans   do n’t exist , the establishment Republicans   say there ’s no such thing , yeah right   —    are the establishment Republicans   more concerned about maintaining control and the establishment Republicans   positions ? Or are the establishment Republicans   more concerned about America ? And if the establishment Republicans   ’re more concerned about America , the establishment Republicans   will not blow up a    process , the establishment Republicans   will let the will of the people prevail .
