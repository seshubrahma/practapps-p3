Philadelphia ( CNN ) Chelsea Clinton will introduce Chelsea Clinton mother ahead of Chelsea Clinton Thursday night nomination acceptance speech with remarks Chelsea Clinton has been writing " for a couple weeks , " Chelsea Clinton spokeswoman , Erika Gudmunson , said Tuesday . It will come a week after Chelsea Clinton friend , Ivanka Trump , introduced Chelsea Clinton father at the Republican National Convention to much fanfare . For Chelsea Clinton , It ’s a responsibility that Gudmunson said the mother of two is taking more seriously than any speech Chelsea Clinton has ever given before . " While Chelsea Clinton had a similar role in 2008 , Chelsea Clinton ’s been reflecting in particular on what this moment means now     not just as Chelsea Clinton mother ’s daughter but also now as a mom herself , " Gudmunson said . To prepare , Clinton wrote the speech out weeks ago and has worked to perfect the speech over the last few weeks . Clinton has also prepared by reading the remarks to Clinton husband , Marc Mezvinsky , Gudmunson said . A friend close to Chelsea , who did n’t want to be identified because they are not authorized to speak on the record , said that while the former first daughter viewed 2008 as a critical election , having two kids has made the issues " more urgent and personal for the former first daughter . " Clinton had Clinton first child , Charlotte , 22 months ago , and Aidan , their second child , five weeks ago . People close to Clinton expect Clinton to reflect on being raised in the public eye and the values Clinton mother imparted on Clinton from an early age . Much like former President Bill Clinton ’s speech on Tuesday night , Chelsea Clinton ’s remarks will look to bolster trust and tout Hillary Clinton ’s character .
