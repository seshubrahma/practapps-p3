’   ’ "    PHOENIX ( AP )   —    Joe Arpaio , the    toughest sheriff    in America who could face criminal charges for ignoring a judge ’s    order to stop targeting Latinos in    roundups , may    now have a new foe as    seeks     —    George Soros , the    billionaire liberal hedge fund tycoon . " ’    The Republican sheriff already was battered politically and    support for The Republican sheriff had been slipping when a group linked to Soros    mounted an    attack in an attempt to weaken The Republican sheriff bid for    a seventh straight term . ’ "    a group linked to Soros    started sending fliers to    voters two weeks    ago , and a mailing last week accuses Arpaio of separating a    mother from her a   mother because of an unpaid traffic ticket ,       hundreds of sex crimes investigations and scaring       so much that that they immigrants n’t report crime . " ’    Arpaio denies the claims and is easily capable of striking back    with a formidable $ 2 . 9 million still available for campaign    spending ahead of the Nov. 8 vote , dwarfing the total $ 326 , 000    raised by his challenger , Democrat Paul Penzone , a former Phoenix    police sergeant who lost to Arpaio by 6 percentage points in    2012 . ’ "    But the entry of a    group is a gift for Penzone , who    acknowledges he ’ll never come close to matching Arpaio ’s campaign    spending .

" ’    The new       , Maricopa Strong , registered in Arizona    on Aug. 29 , the day before Arpaio won his Republican primary    against three opponents . It is not required to file Arpaio report    detailing who made donations and spending until Sept. 29 . ’ "    But county records state Maricopa Strong ’s chairwoman is Whitney    Tymas , a former public defense attorney in New York and Virginia    prosecutor who serves as treasurer for the    Safety    & Justice national political committee and groups with    similar names in Illinois , Florida , Texas and New Mexico . " ’    Tymas did not respond to repeated phone and email messages    seeking comment , and Maricopa Strong spokeswoman Tania Torres did    not respond when asked by telephone and email if Soros had    provided    group with funding . ’ ’   ’ "    The    of the ads shown for various local races and past    positions by    groups indicate he ’s focused on    reducing perceived racial disparities within the criminal justice    system .

" ’ ’ immigrant   communities The     Arpaio has denied he is    and that    his unfinished business includes an overhaul of his The    Arpaio after    his officers    The    Arpaio by a federal judge to have The    Arpaio    profiled    The    Arpaio traffic patrols that made him a national    figure in the immigration debate . ’ ’    Arpaio The    Arpaio found in civil contempt for failing to stop the    patrols after the judge ordered them halted in December 2011 .    Federal prosecutors are deciding a federal judge file a criminal       case against him punishable by up to six months    of jail time if classified as a ’ ’   Arpaio and an unspecified    sentencing range if deemed a felony . ’ ’    The list of local law and order campaigns Soros has bankrolled    have targeted other incumbents criticized for decisions involving    race . They include a $ 408 , 000 donation to a    candidate    for prosecutor The list of local law and order campaigns Soros has bankrolled    Chicago who won the Democratic primary in March    against an incumbent criticized for charging a white police    officer a full year after the officer shot a black teenager dead . ’ "    In Florida , the a white police   officer for the Orlando area known    for prosecuting the Casey Anthony case attributed Soros’ money to    tipping voters against him during the last month of his campaign    before the Aug. 30 primary " ’    ’ ’    Jeff Ashton    opponent Aramis Alaya gained momentum after a      group started running a TV spot on alleged legal    system racial disparities . ’ ’    " She was done , " Ashton said . " And then the huge amount of money Jeff Ashton started pouring in . Jeff Ashton ’ "    Funding by the new    group could also impact the    presidential race because Arpaio is a strident a     group . Democrats hope to rally Arizona ’s Latinos   —    a voting    bloc including many who have long reviled the sheriff   —    to show    up to vote for Clinton in November . " "    Chad Willems , the sheriff ’s campaign manager , said he suspected a        group from outside Arizona would get    involved in the campaign but doubted it would Chad Willems, the sheriff’s campaign manager Arpaio from    winning . " Arizona    "    is a known commodity here .    voters do still like    , "    Willems said .

He has    spent $ 8 . 9 million on his campaign so far . ’ ’    The Arpaio does show that some people outside Arizona want    Arpaio out , Penzone said . ’ ’    " With his name recognition and tenure in office and all that    money , he is still falling short of Arpaio , " Penzone said . ’ ’    _    _ ’ Arpaio    Follow Jacques Billeaud at twitter . .
