Polls are tightening in the presidential race with less than two weeks to go before Election Day . Some new surveys show Democrat Hillary Clinton ’s national polling edge narrowing and Republican Donald Trump performing more strongly in the swing state of Florida . Republican Donald Trump still faces a steep uphill climb , and the Electoral College map is extremely challenging for Republican Donald Trump . But the movement in the poll numbers gives Republican Donald Trump campaign hope after perhaps the worst phase of Republican Donald Trump campaign . A new Bloomberg poll in Florida gave Republican Donald Trump a    edge on Wednesday . In the RealClearPolitics ( RCP ) polling average in the Sunshine State , Clinton ’s edge has been eroded from 4 percentage points on Oct. 21 to 1 . 6 points now . In the RCP national average , Clinton’s lead has softened from 7 . 1 points on Oct. 17 to 5 . 1 points now . If the polls froze in their the polls position , Clinton would win the White House comfortably . But the fluidity is causing even some Democrats to warn against complacency . " I think we have to wait and see where we we a week from now , " said one Democratic strategist who asked for anonymity to speak candidly . " But races are n’t over 13 days out . Races are over on Election Day . "
