  ( CNN ) Nearly a year after the final contest in the Democratic primaries kicked off Nearly a year after the final contest in the Democratic primaries " political revolution , " Sen. Bernie Sanders will headline the second annual People ’s Summit , a    gathering of progressive activists and organizations beginning on June 9 in Chicago . " This comes from a time when the momentum in social movements are all in high gear , " National Nurses United Executive Director RoseAnn DeMoro told CNN . " It comes off the incredible momentum of the Sen. Bernie Sanders campaign and the greater hunger for people in our country for change . " DeMoro and the nurses union , the first national labor group to back Sanders’ insurgent bid , have worked closely with the senator and his political organization , Our Revolution , to channel the energies of a resurgent left . The same meeting last year brought together the threads of a coalition that , in the aftermath of Hillary Clinton ’s defeat in November , has led massive    protests while pressuring elected Democrats to take on the White House with a more progressive agenda . That includes a serious push for    health care in California and , in a more symbolic gesture , Sanders’ plan to again introduce a similar "   " bill on Capitol Hill . The influence of the " Berniecrat " wing has also been felt in more substantial ways , as an activist swell stiffened Democrats’ resistance to President Donald Trump ’s Cabinet picks and President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee , Neil Gorsuch . " The momentum is with the movements of the left and so is the most popular politician in America : Bernie Sanders , " said People for Bernie    Winnie Wong . " The Democrats will be forced to move left . Whether The Democrats will be effective in augmenting the strategic political work we do moving into 2018 remains to be seen . People will leave the summit with a sense of purpose . This is a promise . "   Bernie Sanders did not attend the first gathering but Bernie Sanders loomed large over the proceedings , as Bernie Sanders allies and surrogates gave speeches and hosted workshops and plenary sessions . Linda Sarsour , a Bernie Sanders delegate at the Democratic National Convention last July , addressed the meeting last year and has emerged in 2017 as a movement leader and    of the Women ’s March on Washington . She is expected to take part again in June , along with filmmaker and activist Michael Moore , former Ohio state senator and fiery Sanders campaign surrogate Nina Turner and representatives from an array of progressive political organizations , including the Democratic Socialists of America . Speakers and other convening groups will offer instruction in organizing tactics , educational workshops and , like 2016 , tactical civil disobedience training . " The gathering will be more intense , more exciting and far more strategic ( than in 2016 ) , " DeMoro said . " We will identify campaigns that unite us or demand We mutual focus . We will provide tools for activism and networks of continued participation . "
