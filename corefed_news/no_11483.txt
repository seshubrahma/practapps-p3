RACINE , Wisconsin   —    House Speaker Paul Ryan headed to friendly territory in House Speaker Paul Ryan home district   —    Wisconsin ’s first , which most in state politics expect House Speaker Paul Ryan to win   —    to campaign for the final day before blue collar voters who will determine House Speaker Paul Ryan fate . [ But perhaps more importantly than that —   House Speaker Paul Ryan shoring up what is supposed to be House Speaker Paul Ryan base —   House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced by workers in the two Wisconsin factories House Speaker Paul Ryan visited on Monday to answer for globalization .   House Speaker Paul Ryan , facing a primary challenge from Republican businessman Paul Nehlen , hit the campaign trail in the final day before the voters who first sent House Speaker Paul Ryan to Washington 18 years ago decide whether the voters who first sent him to Washington 18 years ago want House Speaker Paul Ryan to stay there . After more than a week of refusing to do any events in the district open to press , Ryan —   on the final day before Tuesday ’s primary with Nehlen —   decided at the last minute to hold two open press events in the Racine area . One , in Racine , happened at AE Tools —   a    Wisconsin manufacturing plant that employs hundreds locally —   where Ryan took questions from workers in a town hall format . The second event , in Pleasant Prairie , was at Ocenco , another manufacturing plant . But it was at the first one that Ryan defended Ryan trade policies , even at one point comparing Ryan and Ryan position on trade to the 2016 GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump . Ryan told a group of workers who assembled in a conference room with almost as many national reporters and media as there were factory workers : I wanted to come here to AE Tools to learn about how you get your jobs . I wanted to come and learn about how our economy works in Racine , because if I do n’t understand how our economy works   …      then I ca n’t be a very good congressman . So one of the things I ’m doing is talking to manufacturers about what is it we can do to make manufacturing more successful . What is it we we we we to have more of these jobs in America ? In addition to pushing his " A Better Way , " agenda which has come under fire during the primary , Ryan made a direct pitch that the way to keep jobs in America America   to prevent outsourcing —   is to do tax reform . Ryan Ryan : This business is taxed at the personal level , so their This business tax rate here is 44 . 6 percent . You know what the companies doing this in other countries are taxed at , like the Canadian companies that produce the same kind of stuff ? They the Canadian companies that produce the same kind of stuff taxed at 15 percent . China is at 25 . Ireland is 12 . 5 . England is 15 . The average in the world is about 23 . So when we tax our we made products , our American manufacturers much higher tax rates than our foreign competitors are taxing theirs our foreign competitors they So when we tax our American made products, our American manufacturers much higher tax rates than our foreign competitors are taxing theirs lose . So one of the things we are trying to do is make it so we we in a better position to keep jobs here in America , to keep manufacturing here . So we we proposed a complete overhaul of our we system to number one get those tax rates down to about the average , 25 [ percent ] . Number two , we we to give businesses the incentive to hire more people and to build more buildings and to buy more machines . Ryan argued that building out a company by building more buildings and buying new machines and hiring new people is too burdensome due to the tax code . " Right now , we have these complicated tax laws that make it hard for them [ businesses ] to do that [ expand ] , " Ryan Ryan . " So we propose to give every American business the ability to write off all of their every American business in their every American business , their every American business , new machines they every American business here in America to employ [ new workers ] . " Ryan Ryan argued for increasing U. S. exports , so products would be manufactured here in the United States and shipped overseas . " If you ’re selling something overseas , what happens if you make that money overseas you have to pay the U. S. tax when you bring the money home —   so companies do n’t do that , " Ryan Ryan . " So what we want to do is make it easier for businesses to stay making things in America , and selling overseas , and then bring that that money to America to America in America . America Ryan Ryan , too , that governmental regulations on energy make it difficult to keep jobs at home . " We ’ve got a lot of oil and gas in America , America Ryan Ryan , arguing that regulations on the energy industry lead to outsourcing . " We have almost a Saudi Arabia in just the heart of Texas , " Ryan Ryan . " So imagine what the world would be like if we opened up our potential we the jobs we would we in America . America Ryan Ryan lowering regulations on the energy the energy industry addition to the tax cuts he Ryan proposing , would make sure " the cost of making something in America is America as much as it otherwise would be . " When the     session started , one factory worker asked Ryan Ryan taxes and how cutting taxes would affect the revenue stream into the federal government . During his Ryan answer , Ryan Ryan more into the globalization issue while also ripping " loopholes " in the tax code . Ryan Ryan : What we ’ve learned is if we actually give businesses we incentive to expand domestically , to buy more machines to buy more buildings and buy more machines , more people will end up going to work and that will actually increase the economy . So there ’s some things we can do to increase economic growth but at the end of the day if we get those [ tax ] rates down and pull those loopholes away so we can lower tax rates . Ryan called the tax code " the worst one in the industrialized world , " saying it " puts us at a huge disadvantage with our foreign competitors . " Ryan told the workers Ryan   and the owner —   at AE that " you ’re competing against other countries , you ’re competing against other manufacturers who will make ratchets , who will make tools , who are making these things in other countries —   they ’re taxed at the workers , much lower rates than AE is taxed . AE " So in order to price competitive , AE has to pay AE and then compete on price against companies in say Canada that are taxed at 15 percent or 25 in Japan or China or wherever , " Ryan said . " We —   we should n’t do We . " Ryan said too that Ryan countries that Americans " compete with " have what he called " consumption Ryan , " pointing out that " they take their tax other countries that Americans "compete with" their other countries that Americans "compete with" , and other countries that Americans "compete with" place the tax other countries that Americans "compete with" their imports . " other countries that Americans "compete with" So let ’s take something we all know —   Harley Davidson , " Ryan continued . He compared the product Ryan a    Honda motorcycle under his hypothetical example , Ryan both Japan and the United States would ship competing motorcycles to Germany to sell them . " Japan Japan and the United States make that Japan Honda motorcycle ] and send it to Germany , that [Honda motorcycle] they Germany that tax Japan of it as it ’s that tax , that tax Ryan said . " And let ’s just say we send a Harley ’s Germany . We tax Germany Harley ’s then it a Harley to Germany . Then they Germany it into Japan , it if Germany go to a Harley dealer in Germany a Harley …     Germany you buy it . " At it point , Ryan said , if Ryan Davidson would want a Harley money it makes off selling a motorcycle in America , " you have to pay an American tax on top of it . " " It ’s a double duty , " Ryan said . " Ryan oh by the way , when that tax goes into Germany an American tax taxed Germany the way an American tax as an import . We do the opposite , we tax exports and not imports We So what we propose is   …      We the tax off our exports . an American tax then cited We Ryan : " Have you ever heard of Johnson Controls ? They make the thermostat here , " Johnson Controls said . " Ryan ’re now becoming an Irish company Johnson Controls They ’re doing this transaction to become Johnson Controls . You know I love Irish , I ’m    but I Irish n’t like the fact that people are going to go become Irish companies . Their tax rate is 12 . 5 Irish companies . So this is the problem . We have more and more American companies becoming foreign companies in part , not always but in part because of the tax code . Miller is brewed in Milwaukee but it ’s not owned —   it the tax code not an American company any the tax code . " Ryan again pushed for tax reform to fix this problem Ryan now admits is happening . So what we ’re trying to do is clean up our tax laws so it makes sense we be an American company . [ So that ] it pays to be an American company . So that we can make things in America America put ourselves in a better position so that we can make things and sell them we . The last thing I things say is this , 96 percent of the world ’s consumers —   the world ’s people the world they do n’t live in America America They the world’s people in the other countries . So the world’s people we want to have a good economy where we make stuff here , a    economy we we have to sell things overseas . But we have to set ourselves up to be we to do all we . We ’re only 4 percent of the world we population , and there ’s the world’s could possibly consume all that we produce in America we we ’re a good economy we We ’re a stronger economy   …     . So we have to get our tax laws competitive so it We sense to keep We stuff here . The our tax laws question was about the Trans Pacific Partnership , which until recently Ryan Ryan he Ryan . He Ryan says he Ryan it in its current form and says there wo n’t be any it on it until it is renegotiated , since there are not it votes it pass it as is . Ryan Ryan it is unlikely the it Rim trade deal would come it for a vote because " we do n’t have the votes for it right now , because people like me Ryan problems the Pacific Rim trade deal significant provisions of it . " He Ryan : But here ’s the point : We do need trade agreements . I know a lot of people just say get rid of trade agreements , do n’t do trade agreements , they ’re terrible . That ’s a problem for us a lot of people They ’re just wrong . I just said it : a lot of people 96 percent of the the world consumers live in other countries , and we have to make things to sell them overseas to keep us fully employed , you ’ve got other countries open up markets to our products . There ’s three points I ’d make , us ’s point number one . Point number two : We ’re in a global economy whether we like it or not . The question is who is going to write the rules for the global economy ? Is America going to America the rules to benefit us , or do we retreat and the rules for the global economy the game —   not get involved us   and let other countries like China write the rules ? We China n’t have a trade agreement with China the rules for the global economy wo n’t us China at any time in the near future . us do n’t want to see the playing field so that China writes us rules for China China our expense . So China ’s really important the rules for the global economy countries to agree to us by our rules , our standards , our rules and standards so that we ’re not undercut we so that we can get we level playing field   … we . Right now , that agreement we the TPP ] is n’t there . It is n’t up to the standards in my opinion . Ryan continued Ryan arguing again that agreement it ’s " important that we get good agreements . " He said Ryan Let me give you another example , not just Asia —   Europe . The Europeans are going around the world trying to get other the world agree to their standards for cheese . We not only put cheese on our heads when we go to The Europeans Field , we make we . But there ’s no we we could we as much cheese as we we in Wisconsin . Our dairy farmers and our we producers —   which is one we our big exports here we it is basically we big employment of rural Wisconsin —   we we Colby , we make Swiss , we make Gouda , we make Wisconsin , I we you name it we Other countries will we if the name we the cheese has a European name on Parmesan , you can only buy it from here —   you ca n’t buy it from Parmesan America They want Canada to Parmesan to this . So Canada now , according Parmesan this agreement Canada Other countries we make Gouda or Parmesan at Sargento —   or Swiss —   that agreement Green Bay , they ca n’t buy it . It ’s got to Swiss coming from Europe . So here ’s we make Gouda or Parmesan at Sargento —  or Swiss —  up in Green Bay problem , if Parmesan standstill Parmesan a trade deal you ’re falling Europe . So we ’ve got all these other countries going around the world getting better deals in the the world knocking us out of those markets so that our dairy farmers ca n’t , you know , grow dairy because we ca n’t sell to these markets we That ’s what happens if we do n’t engage . We our dairy farmers got to go to those markets to drop that now . Now we ’ve got to go we the damage it does to Wisconsin , so that ’s why you need we agreements to say ‘ do n’t agree to their rules Wisconsin please use our rules’ so we can have markets for our products . Ryan added Ryan ultimately with every trade deal " the question is , ‘ Is it a we agreement or not ? ’ " " That ’s what Donald Trump says as well , " Ryan continued . " We want good trade agreements . We do n’t want bad ones . We want good ones . But you got to have , in an We like this , trade agreements so We can make it here and sell it there —   instead of making it there and selling it there We That ’s the difference here . it
