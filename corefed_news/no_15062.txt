London ( CNN ) The Trump administration ’s military strike on a Syrian government airbase is barely hours old , but The Trump administration’s military strike on a Syrian government airbase has plunged the 45th US President headlong into the world ’s most intractable foreign policy crisis .

Donald Trump will likely face fallout , and in a way that is unexpected or unmanageable .   Remember : Assad has been under an effective siege for five years , so the same poor decision making that allegedly led     according to the US and others     to the chemical weapons strike in Idlib , may lead to other bad judgments .

They clearly made a bad call in testing an inexperienced US president over the Idlib chemical weapons attacks , and incorrectly judged an inexperienced US president over the Idlib chemical weapons attacks was too distracted or isolationist to respond .   But They have carried out years of airstrikes     likely killing hundreds of thousands     used starve and surrender tactics , bombed hospitals repeatedly , and carried out at least two savage chemical weapons attacks .

The rebels had Turkey , then the West , then some Gulf states , then    then ( distractingly and damagingly ) ISIS , then Turkey again .
