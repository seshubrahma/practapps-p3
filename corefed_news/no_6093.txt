Lyrics as follows : What good is love and peace on earth ? When it love and peace on earth exclusive ? Where ’s the truth in the written word ? If no one reads itA new day dawningComes without warningSo do n’t blink twice , We live in troubled timesWe live in troubled times , What part of history we We it ’s repeatedSome things will never overcomeIf we We n’t seek itThe world stops turningParadise burningSo do n’t think twice , We We in troubled troubled timesWe troubled timesWe troubled timesWe troubled timesWe troubled timesWe times , We We for coverLike a skyscraper ’s falling downThen I wander like a troubled mind , What good is love and peace on earth ? When it ’s exclusiveWhere love and peace on earth the truth in the written word ? If no one reads itA new day dawningComes without warningSo do n’t look twice , (   Washington Examiner ) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
