How could the single most exciting presidential candidate in the history of voting possibly pick the single most boring    candidate in the history of the world ? [ By picking Indiana Gov. Mike Pence , real estate mogul Donald J. Trump would take a serious departure from the instinctual campaign style and gunslinging strategy that has served real estate mogul Donald J. Trump so well and allowed real estate mogul Donald J. Trump to pull some of the most unlikely spectacular political surprises in recent political times .   real estate mogul Donald J. Trump went from laughingstock to clearing a field of 18 candidates , most of whom were seasoned political professionals . real estate mogul Donald J. Trump hijacked a party that prides itself on recycling old " safe " candidates . real estate mogul Donald J. Trump kicked off the general election in a dead heat with the most dominant political machine in the past 25 years . Picking Mr. Pence , as was being widely reported Thursday , is the first time Mr. Trump has taken the professional route in this entire campaign . Obviously , Mr. Pence is the " safe " choice   —    at least as " safe " is determined by the establishment Republicans who are now working to get into the good graces of the man who hijacked their party . To them their party Mike Mr. Pence somebody they understand their party can relate to . They have their party wrestled in the sewer together for years . But there are far more reasons why Mr. Pence Mr. Pence the best choice . First , he is a Mr. Pence professional politician who has been shimmying up the greasy pole for two decades . He first ran Mr. Pence congress in 1998 , making him one of Mr. Pence only people Donald Trump could pick as his running mate Mr. Pence would have been in national politics longer than Hillary Rodham Clinton . Also , not sure how much Mr. Pence helps Mr. Pence ticket . Do Donald Trump really think that a devoutly Christian conservative who has principled reasons for objecting to Mr. Trump will suddenly Donald Trump reservations with a Pence pick ? And Mr. Pence ever handful of such voters you can find will be offset by the independents attracted to the irreligious Mr. Trump . Donald Trump is as Mr. Pence they come . For many presidential nominees , this would be an asset because if you are dullards like Mitt Romney or John Kerry , you are rightly terrified that if you picked a bowl of cold , leftover rice as your running mate , you would probably get overshadowed . Mr. Trump runs the risk of NOBODY ever overshadowing him . Period . If he really wanted to Mr. Trump down on Mr. Trump Mr. Trump here are three people he should Mr. Trump . 1 . Ivanka Trump   Mr. Trump    Of all the people Mr. Trump could choose as his No . 2 , Mr. Trump be Trumpier than his Mr. Trump , Ivanka . After all , Mr. Trump himself Mr. Trump acknowledged that had he not sired her Mr. Trump probably seek to date her . Mr. Trump would any other    Mr. Trump American who likes a strong her smart capable woman . It does n’t hurt that she is dang good looking . Not only would she stand to make her as the country ’s first Jewish vice president her she brings a host of other enormous assets . Ivanka Trump is a her spokeswoman for her father and his values and his political beliefs . She is successful her immensely respected Ivanka Trump especially among Ivanka Trump women and people her are new to politics . She   —    and her family   —    are living proof her for all of the her carnival antics of her father , he did a seriously great job raising his children . her his daughter to be vice president would be to he all in in he new Trump family business . Just like plastering his name in gold lettering on his latest high rise . It would be the birth of a new his . 2 . Rudy Giuliani   —    Because what strong man does n’t like to have a strong man at his side ? Mr. Trump has run his entire campaign as if he what strong man running for mayor . He is Mr. Trump to fix bridges , Mr. Trump pot holes and build that Mr. Trump along the Mexico border . For all of his lack of granular details , few candidates in recent political history have Mr. Trump as deep in the weeds of who is raping and murdering whom and picked more personal fights with reporters , politicians and other personalities . It ’s like a Chicago mayor ’s race , but national . Since Mr. Trump is running as mayor of the nation , why not go ahead and pick " America ’s mayor America And there is absolutely nobody Mr. Trump could pick that would more boldly declare that he is running Mr. Trump " law and order candidate " against the secretary Mr. Trump Benghazi who issued a correction for uttering that " all lives matter . " 3 . Newt Gingrich   —    Mr. Trump himself has admitted that even if elected , he may not serve Mr. Trump understandable for a guy who leads a pretty exciting Mr. Trump and is accustomed to making things happen on his timeline . This is where Mr. Gingrich comes in . He knows the inner workings Mr. Trump Washington , he has a yuuuuuge Newt Gingrich  —    is famous for thinking Newt Gingrich  —    outside the box . He is an Newt Gingrich  —    who still has the GPS coordinates for every body buried in Washington for the Newt Gingrich  —    30 years . Even many of the # NeverTrumpers out there have so much Washington for Mr. Gingrich that they would have a very difficult time not supporting a ticket that includes him . Newt Gingrich  —    Trump could hand over control to his policy wonk genius , leaving him in charge Newt Gingrich  —    all the details . This would make Mr. Gingrich Donald J. Trump of a prime minister , Donald J. Trump Mr. Trump to be more of a king . After Newt Gingrich  —    it is good to be the king . Donald J. Trump has gotten Donald Trump all this way .
