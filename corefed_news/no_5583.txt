CNN host Don Lemon said Wednesday evening the broadcasted torture of a bound and gagged victim in Chicago was not " evil , " adding that the suspects had " bad home training . " [ News broke nationally Wednesday after a Facebook Live video showed the victim beaten , slashed , held at knifepoint , and more in a Chicago apartment while assailants are heard saying " fuck white people " and " fuck Trump . " Chicago police held a press conference the same day to announce an investigation is underway and four adults are in police custody . The suspects held the " traumatized " victim for as many as 48 hours , police said .   " The fact that this was a vulnerable person that was probably duped into going along with them . this appears it is someone who is mentally disabled , I think makes it even more sickening , " said guest Matt Lewis . " But at the end of the day , you just try to wrap your head around evil . That ’s what this is , this ’s evil . this ’s brutality . this ’s man ’s inhumanity to man . " " I do n’t think this ’s evil , " Lemon replied . " I do n’t think this ’s evil . I think these are young people and I think these have bad home training . I say , who is raising these ? I have no idea who ’s raising these young these no one I know on Earth who is 17 years old or 70 years old would ever think of treating another person like that . It is inhumane . And you wonder , at 18 years old , where is your parent ? Where ’s your guardian ? " During the same discussion , Democrat strategist and former press secretary for Bernie Sanders Symone Sanders said the attack was " not a hate crime " if the suspects were motivated by " hate of Donald Trump .
