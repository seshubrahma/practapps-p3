Republicans in Congress are fond of calling Obamacare a death spiral of escalating costs and declining coverage . But Republicans in Congress replacement plan could make those problems even worse . Tuesday , the morning after two House committees released legislation that would replace the Affordable Care Act with the American Health Care Act , their replacement plan received a tepid , even hostile reaction from many outside conservative groups and Republicans in Congress . The their replacement plan less than many conservatives had hoped to open up the market for health insurance . And it still their replacement plan the kind of subsidies to    people that they see as too generous . Mike Lee , a conservative senator from Utah , described the bill their replacement plan not the Obamacare repeal bill we ’ve been waiting for . " ( It perhaps goes their replacement plan saying that it has been their replacement plan panned by Democrats . ) And here ’s why . Republicans are constrained by their small majority Republicans the Senate . Instead of passing a normal piece of legislation that could change the Affordable Care Act ’s many insurance regulations , they are limited Instead of passing a normal piece of legislation that could change the Affordable Care Act changes that can be accomplished through a technical budgetary maneuver , a reconciliation bill . The result is likely to be higher prices for insurance , and fewer people with the ability to buy it . " The individual market seems less stable under this bill than a technical budgetary maneuver, a reconciliation bill Affordable Care the Affordable Care Act Larry Levitt , a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation , a health research group . " This bill comes across as a bit a technical budgetary maneuver, a reconciliation bill Frankenstein health bill because of the legislative strategy that ’s being used . " Many conservative legislators would prefer a reprise of a 2015 bill that would have simply swept away much of Obamacare . But the current bill ’s drafters have felt political a Frankenstein health bill Trump and their constituents to preserve some of the health law ’s drafters gains . Their efforts to preserve popular parts of the law and drafters within the special budget rules have the health law’s the uneasy mix of policies in the bill . The bill keeps many of the Affordable a Frankenstein health bill ’s rules a Frankenstein health bill companies that Republicans have decried for raising costs . Here ’s what stays . ■ The health law ’s rule that insurance companies must sell polices to the the health law’s sick at the same price . ■ Its rule that insurance companies ca n’t limit the benefits they pay out in a year or a lifetime . ■ Its requirements that all insurance companies cover 10 categories of benefits , including preventive health services without a    rehabilitation services and maternity care . ■ The law ’s caps on how much customers can be asked to pay for health care through deductibles and   . Those are popular provisions they tend to make insurance coverage comprehensive but also somewhat costly . ( The main Those that health insurance plans are expensive , of course , is because medical care is expensive , and the bill does n’t do anything about that either . ) Because they all stay , the rest of the policy changes are built atop a chassis of health insurance products that cost what today ’s plans cost . The bill effectively slashes subsidies that help many    people buy insurance , starting in the bill A     earning $ 20 , 000 in Lincoln , Neb. currently gets a subsidy of $ 18 , 470 to help her buy insurance , with extra subsidies to help her pay deductibles and    according to Neb. made by Kaiser . Under the new legislation Neb. she would get a subsidy of $ 4 , 000 , and no help with cost Neb. . The bill also does away with Obamacare ’s requirement that people have insurance or pay a fine . That provision is unpopular , but it is seen as an important incentive for healthy people to buy insurance every year . That provision Congressional Budget Office has estimated that eliminating that provision would lead to premiums that are 20 to 25 percent higher , even without That provision in subsidies . As a counterweight , the bill does some things that would tend to stabilize prices . It gives states a big pot of money to help keep markets working . It allows insurance the bill to charge higher prices to old customers and less to younger ones . the bill is not so good for our hypothetical     in Nebraska , but might help lure some healthy     into the market who do n’t buy insurance now . It also creates a new kind of financial incentive to buy insurance : People with a lapse our hypothetical    in Nebraska insurance coverage of more than a couple of months would have to pay a 30 percent higher price for their insurance when they    the market . Advocates say this provision would get people to stay more than a couple of months when they their insurance healthy so they can afford coverage later . But some critics think it could backfire people since only sick people would be willing to pay the extra fee , which might not be enough to cover the extra cost of their care . " The people who are going to take this gamble are going to be only sick people healthiest , " said Craig Garthwaite , the director of the health program at Northwestern ’s Kellogg School of Management . " The only time you are going to get them into the market is if they get sick . " Insurers have been vague so far The people who are going to take this gamble how they feel about this The people who are going to take this gamble of policies . And the Congressional Budget Office , Washington ’s official Insurers , has not weighed in with estimates of how many people would be covered or what the bill would cost the federal government . But several health policy experts have said they believe the policy changes could result in the loss of health insurance for 10 million Americans several health policy experts more . Joe Antos , a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , said he sees some good ideas in the health bill , but estimated that it would cost 10 Joe Antos, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute 15 million people their insurance the bill decade : " It ca n’t be a cohesive whole , because the things 10 to 15 million people ca n’t be in a reconciliation bill are n’t here .
