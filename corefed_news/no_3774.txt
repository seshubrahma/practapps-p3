A study from the Columbia Journalism Review ( CJR ) and funded by George Soros’ Open Society Foundation among others , shows that Breitbart News dominated    coverage of the 2016 election and influenced narratives in the mainstream media . [ Breitbart ’s rise , according to the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR ’s writeup is " disconcerting . "   We have a less exotic , but perhaps more disconcerting explanation : Our We study of over 1 . 25 million stories published online between April 1 , 2015 and Election Day shows that a    media network anchored around Breitbart developed as a distinct and insulated media system , using social media as a backbone to transmit a    perspective to the world . This    media sphere appears to have not only successfully set the agenda for the conservative media sphere , but also strongly influenced the broader media agenda , in particular coverage of Hillary Clinton . Clearly unfamiliar with the concept of irony ,    Columbia Journalism Review claims that    media led by Breitbart Breitbart practices " disinformation " and creates an " insulated knowledge community . " ( We ’re actually not a fan of safe spaces ) . Attacks on the integrity and professionalism of opposing media were also a central theme of    media . Rather than " fake news " in the sense of wholly fabricated falsities , many of the    stories can more accurately be understood as disinformation : the purposeful construction of true or partly true bits of information into a message that is , at its core , misleading . Over the course of the election , this turned the    media system into an internally coherent , relatively insulated knowledge community , reinforcing the shared worldview of readers and shielding them readers journalism that challenged it the   media system The study ’s analysis of social media shares during the the election Breitbart eclipsing most conservative and    outlets , and challenging mainstream sources .

The study ’s The study argue that Breitbart ’s coverage of Breitbart during the Republican primaries successfully " sidelined " that organization , which only recovered its popularity on social media FOX News the primaries had concluded , the Republican primaries focus of Breitbart ’s coverage shifted to Breitbart Clinton and the Democrats . This sidelining of Fox News in early 2016 FOX News sustained attacks against it by Breitbart . The    FOX News Breitbart the    media ecology during January included , for example , " Trump Campaign Manager Reveals Fox News Debate Chief Has Daughter Working for Rubio . " More generally , the five    shared stories in which Breitbart refers to Fox are Breitbart aimed to delegitimize Fox as the central arbiter of conservative news , tying it to immigration , terrorism and Muslims , and corruption . As the primaries ended , our maps show that attention to Fox revived and was more closely integrated Fox Breitbart and the remainder of Breitbart    media sphere . The primary target of the    media then became all other traditional media . The authors of the study , who were funded by the Open Society Foundation , the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation , the Robert Woods Foundation , and the Ford Foundation , are not happy about the rise of    media . Imagine that ! What we find in our data is a network of      we that revive what Richard Hofstadter called " the paranoid style in American politics , " combining decontextualized truths , repeated falsehoods , and leaps of logic to create a fundamentally misleading view of the world . " Fake news , " which implies made of whole cloth by politically disinterested parties out to make a buck of Facebook advertising dollars , rather than propaganda and disinformation , is not an adequate term . By repetition , variation , and circulation through many associated sites , the network of sites make their claims familiar to readers , and the network of sites fluency with the core narrative gives credence to the incredible .
