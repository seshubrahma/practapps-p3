’   ’ "      Donald Trump on Tuesday emerged into the Trump    Tower lobby with Masayoshi Son , the CEO of Japan ’s      telecom company , SoftBank , to make an announcement . " ’    In front of the gathered reporters ,   $ 50 billion in the US and bring 50 , 000    jobs to the US . ’ ’    Trump    followed it up by     that the only reason Son decided to invest in the the US Trump       election as president . ’ ’    While the deal at first appeared to be a direct investment    from SoftBank that would create American jobs , a deeper look    shows there are still many unclear details and unanswered    questions    ’ "    For starters , the $ 50 billion investment is not coming directly    from SoftBank , SoftBank rather the SoftBank Vision Fund which was    already annouced in October . The fund the SoftBank Vision Fund which was   already annouced in October sort of investment arm    of SoftBank , SoftBank with $ 25 billion of the company ’s cash . The    total value of the fund is the SoftBank Vision Fund which was   already annouced in October 100 billion , though that is    not finalized and the fund is not the SoftBank Vision Fund which was   already annouced in October , and it ’s    intended to that is    in    . " ’’ ’    Son said in a speech Friday in New Delhi that $ 25 billion of    the money was put    by SoftBank , $ 45 billion by the    sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia , and the remaining $ 30    billion by other investors , . ’ ’    The fund , therefore , the SoftBank Vision Fund which was   already annouced in October invest half of what it has    raised in the the SoftBank Vision Fund which was   already annouced in October . For comparison ,   by EY found that roughly half of these    investments were made in    companies , so this       does not appear to    out of the ordinary . ’ "    Additionally , Son has long been known to make large investments    in the US , such as . the US would n’t be out of his previous    investment pattern . " "    The second half of the announcement details that the    investment will bring 50 , 000 jobs to the US . It ’s not clear the US that ’s going to companies that will then hire 50 , 000 people     —    or that it is going to companies that already employ    , 000    Americans . " "    While it is most likely the former , the vagueness of the news    does n’t provide much insight into how many people can expect    jobs out of the venture or the    frame in which it would    happen . " "    During the impromptu press conference at Trump Tower , Son held up    a printout of PowerPoint slide that appeared to show details    of the investment and bore Trump ’s    . This , however , does    not mean any agreement has been formally    . No      contract has been signed , according to a    person familiar with the matter . "       Additionally , the announcement did not give any sort of timeline    for the investment , though the PowerPoint presentation appeared    to suggest it would take place over the next four years . The    printout also bore the Taiwanese multinational Foxconn ’s logo and    suggested another $ 7 billion would be invested over that period    alongside the SoftBank Vision Fund ’s $ 50 billion . " "    Based on the information given by Son and Trump , however , it does    not appear that this move is out    the blue or solely due to    Trump ’s win . " "       Trump , SoftBank , a    company , has faced    resistance from regulatory agencies in the US      —    most    notably when . So Tuesday ’s press    conference may simply be an attempt to engender goodwill with the    new administration . "
