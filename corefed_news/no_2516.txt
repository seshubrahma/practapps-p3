The Federal Reserve raised The Federal Reserve benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for just the second time since the 2008 financial crisis . Economists talk a lot about the impact this will have on markets , but what about everyday consumers ? The Fed ’s decision can affect the cost of housing , cars , student loans and even the interest on your credit card   —    though not all necessarily right away . And when Fed Fed rates , all sorts of other expenses eventually tick up . The move is part of what will be a slow , upward climb for what ’s known as the federal funds rate . Banks are ordered by law to have a certain amount of money in reserve , so they Banks make overnight loans to each other to keep those balances up . The the federal funds rate the level of interest that applies to those    loans . overnight loans has been the federal funds rate zero since 2008 , as part of the Fed ’s strategy to bring the nation out of a recession , there ’s hardly anywhere for it to go but up . As the nation economy improves and    Donald J. Trump unveils his stimulus package , economists expect rates   Donald J. Trump rise steadily over a period of years . " The bottom line , ostensibly , is that the economy is getting stronger , " the economy Baker ,    of the Center for Economic and Policy Research . " Nobody in their right mind would say , ‘ I ’d rather have higher unemployment and lower interest rates.’ Nobody wants to pay a higher interest rate , but I think that ’s an easy choice for most people . " If you ’re going to buy a home , chances are that you will opt for a      mortgage . Most home buyers do . Those loans have become remarkably affordable , especially since the financial crisis , with their interest rates bottoming out at around 3 Those loans 5 percent . In general , movement of the Fed ’s rate does not have a large , direct impact on    mortgage rates . But when the Fed ’s rate goes up , banks the Fed’s rate borrowing costs along to consumers . And because    mortgage rates banks set in stone , they also factor in the anticipation of future rate increases . That ’s mortgage rates of why mortgage rates have been shooting up in recent months : The Fed has suggested that interest rates are likely to Fed for years . The average interest rate on a mortgage this month is 4 . 3 percent , according to LendingTree , and the average loan on a      mortgage is worth about $ 237 , 000 . If the borrowing rate were to rise by , say , another percentage point in the coming year , this would mean an additional $ 138 a month on the average mortgage   —    leading to nearly $ 50 , 000 in added interest over the duration of the loan . As mortgage rates go up , people are a little less likely to buy a house , and those with    mortgages are less likely to refinance ( because they probably will not end up with a better deal ) . An interesting those with   mortgages is that as a result , volume   —    that is , the amount of new mortgage contracts being issued   —    goes down . So brokers could also start loosening their requirements for new mortgages . The annual percentage rate on your credit card brokers be anywhere from 15 percent to 20 percent   —    much higher than the interest rate on a mortgage or a car loan . An uptick in the Fed ’s interest rate might cause your credit card ’s A. P. R. if it ’s variable as opposed to fixed at a specific rate , to bounce by one or two percentage points . The effects of that can be larger than they may initially seem , in part because the interest compounds . That is , you begin to pay interest on what you owe and the interest that you have been accumulating on that . " If you ’re accumulating credit card debt for a year , " said Markus K. Brunnermeier , a Princeton economist , " moving from 13 percent interest to 15 percent is a much bigger deal than moving something from 1 percent to 3 percent . " Rates for student loans , like other forms of borrowing , are at a relative low . But as the Fed ’s rate rises , that will change for those just starting to think about paying for college . Federal loans are tied to the    Treasury rate , which factors in the Fed ’s anticipated interest rates over the coming decade . Because these rates Fed Fed tick up steadily by the Fed ’s own forecasts , students planning to take out loans in the the Fed’s can Fed the government ’s student loan rates to rise . " Students taking out new debt will be looking at higher payments , " Dr. Baker said , adding that he expected rates could rise by one or two percentage points in the next few years . Dr. Baker for car loans , too , are already climbing in response to the Fed ’s expected move . Auto loans tend to last only a few years , so Fed still time for car buyers to get ahead of the curve . That ’s because the Fed , in its most recent economic projection , predicted that interest rates will continue climbing into Fed decade . A Fed years from now , a car loan issued in 2017 could be fully paid off , and interest rates may still be on the rise . " If you ’re thinking of buying it now or in two years’ time , you should buy it now , " Dr. Brunnermeier said . What about renters ? An    increase may also affect them it —    just not as directly . Higher rates mean that landlords must pay more to purchase renters renovate their properties , so in the long run , those are costs they could easily pass on to renters landlords —    though it ’s not necessarily a given that it those happen . And with the labor market improving , workers’ wages could rise at about the same it as rent prices , said Stephen D. Oliner , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and former member of the Federal Reserve Board . " It ’s possible that with their wages rising , people will be able to keep up with the higher payments on their rents , " he said .
