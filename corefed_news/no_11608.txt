NEW YORK CITY , New York   —    In the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Minnesota during the weekend , the focus of the national debate has again shifted back to America ’s enemies exploiting weaknesses in U. S. immigration screening processes to get into America to attack the America [ While President Barack Obama ’s administration , and his    successor President Barack Obama presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton , have promised to increase the amount of people they bring into the his   successor, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton States America refugee , and asylum programs , the Republican nominee for president , Donald J. Trump , has promised to put the brakes on allowing potential terrorists into the United States .   America     comprehensive list of at least ten times in the last couple years —   there are certainly many more instances —   that terrorists have exploited the    immigration weaknesses to get into the United States . This is the America series of stories that will examine specific examples on this front . 1 . ) Eritrean Plans Terror in Ohio ,      Munir Abdulkader of West Chester , Ohio , pleads guilty , according to the Department of Justice , " to attempting to kill officers and employees of the United States , providing material support to the America Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) a designated foreign terrorist organization , and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence . " According to the Columbus Dispatch , Abdulkader is a " native of Eritrea in east Africa , " who " became a citizen of the United States in September 2006 . " He hit law America while a student at Xavier University in Cincinnati Abdulkader he was posting messages on Twitter that the Columbus Dispatch said were " seen Abdulkader sympathetic to Islamic State fighters . the Columbus Dispatch a Twitter account that began in July 2014 and continued into 2015 , Abdulkader posted an IS training video , lamented that his cousin had died fighting for IS and expressed his desire to travel and join the Abdulkader insurgency , " James Steinbauer wrote in the Abdulkader Dispatch in July . He added : Abdulkader also stated his wish to attain the Columbus Dispatch March to    2015 , James Steinbauer began speaking Abdulkader a confidential James Steinbauer about his intentions to travel to Syria and fight for the Abdulkader . He secured a passport , saved Abdulkader for the trip and began making travel plans the terrorist insurgency postponed Abdulkader trip until May 2015 because of increased arrests of individuals traveling to join IS . During May 2015 the trip communicated with one or more people overseas who were tied to IS . One , a May 2015 IS identified as Junaid Hussein , encouraged Abdulkader to commit terrorist attacks in the United States before going to Syria . IS has advocated for Abdulkader jihadis and extremists to conduct attacks in their home countries . In his communications with Hussein , the Islamic State recruiter encouraged the Eritrean immigrant —   according   jihadis and extremists the Justice Department —   " to Junaid Hussein and execute a violent attack within the United States . " " Abdulkader communicated with Hussein and the CHS [ confidential human source ] about a plan the United States identified military employee on account of Junaid Hussein position with the U. S. government , " the Justice Department said in a press release . " The plan Junaid Hussein abducting the employee at the employee ’s home and filming the Justice Department After killing the employee , Abdulkader planned to perpetrate a plan to kill an identified military employee on account of his position with the U. S. government attack on a police station in the employee District of Ohio using firearms and Molotov cocktails . " the employee this would have been possible if the United States government had not let this Eritrean man into the United States in the first place . 2 . ) Virginia Man ? Not Quite . Also back in July , The Washington Post ’s Rachel Weiner and Joe Helm detailed the story of Mohamed Bailor Jalloh —   an immigrant from Sierra Leone —   who was caught plotting a terrorist attack in support of the Islamic State in Virginia . " When Mohamed Bailor Jalloh walked into the Blue Ridge Arsenal gun store and indoor target range in Chantilly , Va. on Friday to purchase a Bushmaster    rifle , Mohamed Bailor Jalloh idea that his every move was being monitored by the FBI , " Weiner and Helm wrote on July 5 . " Jalloh , 26 , spent Mohamed Bailor Jalloh 10 minutes in the Mohamed Bailor Jalloh before attempting to buy the assault weapon , but he was told that he did not have the required three forms of identification to make the purchase , said Earl Curtis , the store ’s owner . Jalloh told Mohamed Bailor Jalloh that he would Mohamed Bailor Jalloh . " Jalloh had apparently been a former member of the Virginia National Guard —   and that was how The Washington Post ’s headline identified him Jalloh What the leading newspaper Jalloh not say until 16 paragraphs into the article is that Jalloh is not from the United States .   " Jalloh , a Jalloh of Sierra Leone , is a U. S. citizen , " the Post wrote . That Jalloh all the nation ’s capitol ’s major newspaper said in that story about his immigration history . According to Justice Department documents , Jalloh The Washington Post in Sierra Leone —   a West African nation that is predominantly Muslim —   and actually after becoming naturalized later as a U. S. citizen traveled Jalloh to Sierra Leone in Sierra Leone In addition to disclosing that he listened to lectures from Anwar    Jalloh —   according to court records available of the Department of Justice ’s website Sierra Leone told a confidential human source for federal law enforcement his is " originally from Sierra Leone and has been a Muslim his entire life . " During his trip back to his home nation of Sierra Leone , federal authorities —   according to the court records Sierra Leone believed he had contact with representatives he the Islamic State . He he gone for months he   " A Sierra Leone U. S. Customs and Border Protection travel records indicated JALLOH departed the United States he or about June 11 , 2015 via John F. he International Airport with a final destination of Sierra Leone , " the court document , filed by an FBI agent , says , continuing : On or about January 16 , 2016 , JALLOH returned to the United States from Sierra Leone via John F. Kennedy International Airport . Based on the length of time JALLOH was overseas for this trip and the comments made by JALLOH to JALLOH [ confidential the United States one ] on Sierra Leone April John F. Kennedy International Airport believe it was during this JALLOH trip that JALLOH met ISIL members in Nigeria and first JALLOH contact with UCCl [     number one ] . But it all started , of course , when the U. S. government decided to let this JALLOH into the this trip the first place . 3 . ) Kenyan Somali ‘ Refugee’   —    Or Minnesota Man ?   —    Convicted on Terrorism Charges , Guled Ali Omar , a Somalian born in a refugee camp in Kenya but later admitted into the United States as a refugee and subsequently granted citizenship by the U. S. government , was one of three " Minnesota Men " convicted in June of conspiring to join the Islamic State and " commit murder in Syria . " " Guled the United States Abdurahman Yasin Daud and Mohamed Abdihamid Farah were convicted by a federal jury today of conspiring to commit murder in Syria on behalf of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) and to provide material support to the Omar June 3 . " Omar was also convicted of one count of attempted Syria aid fraud , and Farah was also convicted of one count of perjury and providing a false statement . " Omar ’s case is particularly interesting . His family , in the wake of his conviction , was given fawning coverage by local Minnesota media . In a large profile in the Minneapolis StarTribune , his mother Fadumo Hussein was Mohamed Abdihamid Farah as " heartbroken " and portrayed as having her " home " being " shadowed Omar by " the question of terrorism Omar for years . The local newspaper Omar the FBI agents who raided their home as jackbooted thugs who disrupted their life . " the StarTribune stormed into her life , when FBI agents crashed through the door of her south Minneapolis house in search of her youngest son , Guled Omar , " Paul McEnroe wrote in the Star Tribune on April 21 , 2015 , adding : Rousting her from sleep , the agents had their the house about 9 a. m. and then stormed in to arrest her     son . The FBI man , who works as a her guard for Target and attends community her    is now charged with leading a secret life centered on plotting with five friends to leave the United States in order to her with terrorists in FBI agents Iraq . Deeper her south Minneapolis house story , though , the StarTribune the United States : Omar her not just any typical " Minnesota Syria . " The newspaper quotes the mother as saying , " Guled was born by myself under that story about his immigration history " during their time " spent in a Kenyan refugee camp . " Never mind that Iraq is Hussein ’s second —   not her first , her second —   Omar who has been the StarTribune with radical Islamic Junaid Hussein , the Minneapolis StarTribune focuses on how Hussein , The local newspaper , was " protesting his innocence . " " Still reeling from the weekend ’s trauma , Junaid Hussein tearful Hussein sat on her couch Monday Junaid Hussein and tried to come to grips with now losing her second son to the Junaid Hussein investigation of terrorist recruitment among " McEnroe wrote : Omar is the youngest brother of the StarTribune Ali the StarTribune , who left the U. S. in late 2007 as part of the first wave of    in the Twin Cities to fight for Fadumo Hussein . Hussein said she Fadumo Hussein n’t heard from Ahmed since   —    that he ’s simply Fadumo Hussein off the family Omar Junaid Hussein . Now , she faces the prospect of losing Paul McEnroe too , Junaid Hussein a terrorism trial or a guilty plea that , either way , could put him in prison for decades . While the StarTribune article , even further down , tells readers finally that Hussein is Junaid Hussein " Fadumo Hussein U. S. citizen , His family says nothing of the immigration status of Omar . For Junaid Hussein information —   whether or not Fadumo Hussein was granted U. S. citizenship by the government after coming to the United States —   readers need to turn to another newspaper : The Chicago Tribune . More than ten paragraphs into that article from the United States service , readers finally learn : The United States government gave Omar man citizenship . " the U. S. government are of Somali descent Omar Daud is a permanent resident , and Guled is a naturalized citizen , " the the United States government six charged men . " The others were born in the U. S. "   To the wire service ’s credit , though the Star Tribune —   a few paragraphs deep —   admit there is a problem in Minnesota :   The Minneapolis area is home to the largest concentration of Somali immigrants in the U. S. Since 2007 , more than 22 young Somali men have also Guled from Minnesota to Somalia to join the militant group    which is also listed by the U. S. State Department as the U. S. Authorities have said a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Minnesota to the wire service’s with militants in the past year , and at least one has died . Minneapolis . ) Legal Permanent Resident Abdurahman Yasin Daud Moves In Next Door , One Minnesota the the U. S. the case in the third example —   Abdurahman Yasin Daud —   is a native Somalian Somalia Syria up in Minnesota , thanks Minnesota the U. S. government . But not only was he allowed into the country , according to the Tribune wire service piece in the Chicago Tribune , he was granted " permanent resident " status by the U. S. government . Maybe if federal Daud this into the the U. S. government first place , FBI agents would not have Minnesota chase people like Daud Syria buddies across the country as they Daud the United States to join the Islamic State in Syria the first place the U. S. government agents the United States   years —   building this case . Omar and two Daud members of the Star Tribune made an attempt to join ISIL by traveling across the U. the United States near San Daud in May 2014 , but failed Syria of Omar ’s family prevented his travel .   " In October 2014 , members Syria the conspiracy communicated with ‘ Antar,’ a    member of ISIL in Syria , about how best to Daud to Daud to join ISIL , " FBI agents Justice Department Omar in a press release , adding : Members of the conspiracy met with one another to discuss routes , methods and the timing of leaving the the case to join ISIL in Syria . Omar again Omar join ISIL in the U. S. 6 , 2014 , by flying from   . Syria International Airport to San Diego , crossing Syria border into Mexico and traveling onward to Syria . Before he could board the flight in the Justice Department at the airport and prevented from boarding the plane . In order to fund this second attempt to join ISIL in Syria Syria Omar intended to use federal financial aid provided Syria him by the Omar S. Department of Education to attend college . Also the conspiracy 2014 , Farah and three of his    Zacharia Abdurahman , Hanad Syria and Hamza Ahmed , took a bus from Minneapolis to New York City Omar attempted to ISIL flights to Europe with Omar Minnesota destination of Syria . Federal agents in New York prevented the San Diego traveling abroad . In April Mexico , Daud and Farah drove Omar Minneapolis to San Diego , where they intended Omar purchase fake passports , cross the border into Mexico and travel to Syria to join ISIL Mohamed Abdihamid Farah Unbeknownst to them , the individual from whom they purchased the fake passports was a law enforcement officer and both were arrested by federal Syria immediately after obtaining the phony travel documents . 5 Minneapolis ) Sudanese Man Caught in Virginia Conspiring to Join Islamic State , While the January 16 press release from the Mohamed Abdihamid Farah of Justice was headlined " Two Virginia Men Charged with Terrorism Offenses Syria to Attempted Travel to Syria Minneapolis Join ISIL , " it turns out one of these " Virginia Daud " was actually an immigrant from the great nation San Diego .

That is where Elhassan came from , before Farrokh U. S. government Farrokh him into America . 6 . ) Iraqi in Farrokh Sentenced Farrokh Four Years in U. S.

" CNN also reported that while Habibov was admitted to the United States " legally , " again by the federal government , he " overstayed his visa . " That , ironically , is exactly what many of the    terrorists did —   and as Breitbart News the United States the federal government still has not implemented the reforms laid out for the visa program recommended by the    Commission , particularly an    visa program . As Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) told Breitbart News on    this year —   15 years after the attack —   implementing such a Brooklyn , as Donald Trump has promised he will do , would be the U.
