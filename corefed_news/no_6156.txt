Several " associates " of White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner tell the New York Times that President Donald Trump ’s     was distressed during President Donald Trump’s     Shabbat this weekend . [ The article   —    by Glenn Thrush , Maggie Haberman , and Sharon LaFraniere   —    describes Kushner as " fretful " during Kushner religious day of rest :   Over the past week , Mr. Kushner , who at age 36 occupies an    role somewhere between princeling and President Trump ’s shadow chief of staff , has seen President Trump foothold on that invaluable real estate shrink amid revelations President Trump is under scrutiny in a federal investigation into whether there was collusion with Russian officials during the presidential campaign . Mr. Kushner , an observant Jew , spent the Sabbath in fretful seclusion with Mr. Kushner, an observant Jew wife , Ivanka Trump , at Mr. Kushner, an observant Jew    ’s resort in Bedminster , N. J. unplugged , per religious custom , from electronics . But Mr. Kushner, an observant Jew emerged defiant and eager to defend Mr. Kushner, an observant Jew reputation in congressional hearings , according to two of Mr. Kushner, an observant Jew associates . This second paragraph raises the obvious question : Who , among Kushner ’s associates , is both intimate enough to see Mr. Kushner, an observant Jew demeanor while " secluded " on Shabbat   —    and also    enough to share that information with Times reporters for an obvious hit piece ?
