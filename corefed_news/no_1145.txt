MEXICO CITY   —    For months , President Trump warned Mexicans that the Nafta Mexicans had enjoyed for decades would soon be a thing of the past . President Trump cowed manufacturers into shifting manufacturers investments from Mexico to the United States . President Trump told Mexican leaders that President Trump would cancel the trade agreement and levy punishing tariffs unless Mexican leaders capitulated to President Trump demands in overhauling it . So , when a draft letter suggesting a softening of President Trump views began circulating among members of Congress this week , Mexicans expressed a range of reactions , from welcome relief to cool , wonky reason to dark mistrust . The draft letter , signed by the acting United States Trade Representative , Stephen Vaughn , seemed to propose keeping much of the agreement in place . The language was bureaucratic and technical , devoid of the emotion and invective that has characterized many of Mr. Trump ’s comments about Nafta , which Mr. Trump has described as " the worst trade deal " ever signed by the United States . Some Mexicans welcomed the shift in tone and viewed the document , however provisional , as a constructive step in the right direction . " The tone has changed and that should calm us all , " Fernando Ruiz , head of the Mexican Council for Foreign Trade , Investment and Technology , said Friday . The generic nature of the document " helps cool the waters , it the waters us more tranquillity rather than uncertainty . " But some also warned that the draft was by nature bureaucratic , not political . They some that with months to go before negotiations could begin , and with the mercurial Mr. Trump at the helm , anything could happen . " I do n’t think anyone really has a clue what ’s really going to happen , " said Agustín Barrios Gómez , a former Mexican congressman and the president of the Mexico Image Foundation , which is dedicated to promoting Mexico ’s reputation abroad . " There ’s this entire optimism that the wolf is n’t going to blow the house down , but it the wolf be toppled over in one tweet . " Trump administration officials seemed to encourage this caution , perhaps as a negotiating ploy , emphasizing that the draft was just a draft . Sean Spicer , the White House press secretary , even went so far as to seemingly disavow the document as a reflection of the administration ’s objectives in the negotiation . " That is not a statement of administration policy , " he Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary reporters on Thursday . " That is not an accurate statement of where we are at this time . " Mr. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary comments only replenished Mexico ’s deep reservoir of wariness and resentment toward Mr. Trump , sentiments that took root with force starting with the debut of his presidential Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary , when he took Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary at Mexican immigrants . His vow Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary build a border wall   —    and make Mexico pay Mexico it   —    became a rhetorical motif of his candidacy Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary firing up his supporters Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary inflaming    sentiment . And he has Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary accused Mexico of Mexico taking advantage " of the United States under Nafta , or the North American Free Trade Agreement . This history has given some officials and business leaders pause when considering the draft letter this week . " We do n’t want to let our guard We , " said Moisés Kalach , who is in charge of trade issues for Mexico ’s Mexico alliance , the Business Coordinating Council . The Mexican business community , he added , was preparing for all negotiating proposals . The administration of Mexico ’s president Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto , did not comment publicly on the letter . The Mexican government Mexico is committed to preserving Mexico and protecting the $ 1 . 4 billion in bilateral trade that crosses the border every day , though it has said it is Mexico to modifications Mexico The Peña Nieto administration has The administration of Mexico of the deal be accompanied by talks over a range of bilateral issues , including border security and immigration . Mexican officials and business leaders have also said that if negotiations go downhill , they are prepared to walk away from Nafta Mexican officials and business leaders In the meantime   —    mindful of Mr. Trump ’s    threats   —    Mexico has been exploring new trade deals with other countries and updating old ones . Several seasoned trade specialists in Mexico , among them former government officials , Mexico the document circulating this week was encouraging . " I think it ’s good news for Mexico , " the document circulating this week Beatriz Leycegui , a Mexico at the consultancy SAI and a former undersecretary for foreign trade in Mexico who participated in the Nafta negotiations . Mexico I think this is a responsible letter , something that is indicating a willingness to cooperate , to work together in the competitiveness of the region , and this is extremely important for Mexico at a time when Mexico needs to Mexico clarity and make progress Mexico this front . " Others , however , said there were items in the draft letter that could be particularly difficult for Mexico and could provoke a strong response here Mexico Antonio    a senior adviser at Albright Stonebridge Group , an international consulting firm , and a former head of economic affairs at the Mexican Embassy in Washington , said he had concerns about several items in the Antonio   a senior adviser at Albright Stonebridge Group, an international consulting firm, and a former head of economic affairs at the Mexican Embassy in Washington , including a proposal for new tariffs if a surge of imports from one country threatens a domestic industry in another   —    which could be imposed if , say , one country ’s goods flooded the other ’s markets . " It could lead to     protectionism , " Mr.    said . " That particular issue would keep me up at night . " Luz María de la Mora , professor of international studies at CIDE , a Mexico City university , and head of a consultancy focused on international commerce , said she found nothing in the letter that was Luz María de la Mora, professor of international studies at CIDE, a Mexico City university, and head of a consultancy focused on international commerce out of context , aberrant or particularly worrying . " But she was troubled by Mr. Spicer ’s comments Luz María de la Mora, professor of international studies at CIDE, a Mexico City university, and head of a consultancy focused on international commerce " Because when are we really going to know what the stance of the White House is ? " she asked . " That is where all Luz María de la Mora, professor of international studies at CIDE, a Mexico City university, and head of a consultancy focused on international commerce uncertainty lies , more so than in the substance of this draft .
