  ( CNN ) It ’s been a rough week for America , but It ’s been a good week for masculinity . No , not because we had to endure another display of Donald Trump ’s bellicose machismo , but because we witnessed two of the most powerful men in the world allow the most powerful men in the world to shed tears in public . Speaking of his love and appreciation for first lady Michelle Obama , President Obama was moved to tears .   And , surprised by President Obama decision to award him the President Obama Medal of Freedom , Vice President Joe Biden cried , too . Might it be that we are finally , blessedly , moving beyond a world in which " big boys do n’t cry " ? To be sure , there are resisters and naysayers . To take one example , media personality Laura Ingraham insisted that Obama ’s crying was an act . After all , she said media personality Laura Ingraham " I ’ve never seen a man grab a tissue and dab , I ’ve just never seen that . ..   A man will be like ’whatever’ or , like , fake through it or something . " In other words , even though he might A man moved to cry , a real man would never show it . Eight years ago , Ingraham mocked NFL star Brett Favre for being a " big hulky man " who " broke down blubbering " at this retirement press conference . " " Enough with the waterworks , " she demanded Ingraham   Can a real man not cry ? And if he does a real man must he hide a real man ? he does say : Let the tears flow . What makes someone a " real man " ? Who do we want our sons we be ? And who do we want we and husbands to be ? Is the only " real man " an alpha male , one who denies his own vulnerability     sometimes denying it so forcefully that he mocks his denigrates ( or maybe just sneers at ) those he sees his less than perfect , as too vulnerable , as insufficiently tough and guarded ? Might it be that in this day and age a major part of what it ought to mean to be a man is an ability to admit that we are vulnerable , to be as tender as we are we , to live with our hearts we and to refuse to be ashamed about it ?   I am grateful to live at a time when a man     the most powerful man in the world , no less     can model what it means to let life affect him to the point where tears come . Would you want to be married to a man who has never been moved to tears by his love him appreciation of another human being ? But I am not kidding myself . We have a long way to go in transforming masculinity . There are still far too many men     and , if we take We ’s comments as evidence , women     who insist that real men do n’t cry , that a man with a tissue is really just a " sissy . " ( That kind of regressive masculinity , it seems , will now enter the Oval Office . )   Make no mistake : That kind of thinking and talking has real consequences for men and boys . My father died suddenly when I was 12 years old , and I remember     it is etched into my mind and my body     being firmly instructed by a    relative , " You ca n’t cry . You have to hold it together it " I recall being told by countless visitors that " I had to be strong for my mother . " And so I walked around for years pretending to be OK , tough , strong , even though I had just lost everything . That kind of repression takes a toll on a man ’s emotional and physical health . Can a man not be strong and cry     without shame ? Perhaps we can model the courage it takes to cry when our heart we and the world seems to have fallen apart . Perhaps we can we the presence and openheartedness that make it possible to cry because the love another person has for us nourishes we sustains us . we I hope my sons will one day find a love so deep that it moves a love to my sons , and I hope that they remain my sons by those who would deprive them of my sons full range of human emotion . When all is said and done , those who mock men who cry do little but betray their own those who mock men who cry impoverishment .
