The San Francisco Chronicle reports that the Bay Area ’s    anarchists are worried that the violent tactics used by " Black bloc " activists to disrupt Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulous ’s appearance at the University of California , Berkeley last week will cause the    protest movement to lose credibility , as Occupy Wall Street protests did in 2011 . [ The Chronicle notes :   Their biggest fear is a repeat of what happened to Occupy earlier this decade , when black bloc violence chased away nonviolent , mainstream protesters   —    and helped lead to Occupy ’s collapse about five years ago . " That stuff that happened at UC Berkeley with the black bloc was just nuts , does n’t help , " said longtime protester Buck Bagot , who helped organize the Occupy movement in San Francisco and has been mobilizing demonstrations against Trump . " People need to make sure this incredibly negative , destructive element is n’t there in what we do this time . " this time adherents saw Occupy as a    call against income inequality . But many of Its adherents say Occupy fell short of being more than that , partly because violent anarchists came to be the    face of the movement to the broader public . The Occupy Wall Street and Occupy protests took over public spaces for several weeks , throughout the country and abroad . Activists   —    and not just " Black bloc " members   —    often sought confrontations with police . Some did so as a deliberate tactic to gain public attention and sympathy through police overreaction . The encampments , which excluded law enforcement , soon became rife with lawlessness , including a pattern of sexual assaults . While most protesters were peaceful , others were not , and the violent contingent went far beyond the " Black bloc . " President Barack Obama and his party supported the Occupy movement , and the media was broadly sympathetic . Violence and lawlessness turned public opinion decisively against the protests , which also proved unsustainable as the onset of winter made camping outside intolerable in most cities . Joel B.
