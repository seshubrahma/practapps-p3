Rolling Stone ’s Janet Reitman has posted a massive autopsy report on Marco Rubio ’s failed presidential campaign , with one passage laying to waste Janet Reitman " work " on the Gang of Eight immigration bill . This portion sets out to answer angry former Marco consultant Frank Luntz , who asks why Marco Rubio’s ’s Tea Party ascent did n’t bolster Marco Rubio’s 2016 campaign . [ From Rolling Stone :   GOP pollster Frank Luntz , who ’d first met Marco Rubio’s when Marco Rubio’s was gathering " ideas " for Marco Rubio’s book , helped Marco Rubio’s shape Marco Rubio’s message . " Marco Rubio’s was the first Tea Party candidate , and Marco Rubio’s ’s the same man now as Marco Rubio’s was then , " Marco Rubio’s says . " I think a great question is , how did Marco Rubio’s start Marco Rubio’s D. C. career as the first Tea Tea Party and wind up being the establishment choice ? " The answer is , Marco Rubio’s has always been an establishment choice . Since Marco Rubio’s Senate run , Marco Rubio’s truest base has been the broad network of mostly white Republican elites operating behind the scenes . In late 2015 , it was his truest base that Marco Rubio’s campaign had benefited from more " dark money " donations than any other presidential candidate . In his Marco Rubio’s bid , his Senate Marco Rubio’s to have run a grassroots campaign , raising $ 7 million in small donations from ordinary citizens   —    " I ’ve always told people they buy into our agenda , we do n’t our into theirs , " they Marco Rubio’s   —    although it made up only 36 percent of the $ 19 . 7 million raised during his Marco Rubio’s . Top donors included Karl Rove ’s American Crossroads PAC and the conservative activist group Club for Growth , as well as the hedge fund run by Rubio ’s most influential backer , billionaire Paul Singer . In an illustration of the split between the GOP base and its donor class GOP Singer was also a major funder of the movement for gay marriage . The Tea Party , as it became increasingly The Tea Party , had simply been a vehicle for Rubio , whose signature modus operandi , dating back to his earliest days in politics , has been to turn his back on his who ’ve helped him rise   his    something that would come back to haunt him in the his campaign . Rubio had come Rubio the Senate with the support of one of the right ’s biggest and most divisive power brokers , South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint , now head of the Heritage Foundation , who ’d helped engineer Rubio ’s success as a Tea Party candidate . Now Rubio began to Rubio himself from    Rubio outsider " freshman senators like Rand Paul , and later Ted Cruz , who turned    obstructionism into his personal crusade Rubio " If you notice , Rubio did n’t Rubio the Tea Party caucus , even though that ’s how he got elected Rubio " says Alan Becker , the managing partner of the Miami law firm Becker and Poliakoff , where Rubio worked starting Rubio 2003 .    …      Turning away from DeMint , Rubio allied himself Rubio with Rubio . Lindsey Graham and John McCain , two of the most entrenched " moderate " Republicans , who tried to show Rubio the ropes Rubio Washington , steering him toward the Rubio Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees , traditional springboards for presidential hopefuls . Rubio hungrily leapt Rubio the opportunities afforded him . " Rubio was a Rubio commodity , " says a Senate Republican staffer Senate " There was nationwide buzz about him , but Rubio guy did Rubio that because he was famous he Rubio everything . Rubio kept his head Rubio and Rubio . " Yet if Rubio did have a Rubio spot , it was on the one issue he ’d connected with Rubio his life , and Rubio , ironically , would also be a part of the undoing of his presidential ambitions : Rubio . There are two ways to look at Rubio ’s involvement in Rubio debate on immigration reform : It was clearly an issue that , because of Rubio ’s popularity with both Rubio Party conservatives and Hispanics , could give him a platform , but it Rubio also the kind of    risk that went against Rubio ’s basic political character . Rubio him to take an actual it . Rubio ’s history on immigration had so Rubio , like much of the rest of him , a study in contradiction . While Rubio to never openly seem    he had been immigration advocates’ quiet ally in Rubio Florida House . During his Senate run , however , Rubio tacked Rubio to the right , defending Rubio ’s draconian immigration law , only to backpedal several weeks later . He at times seemed    then against it Rubio Still , veteran    like McCain    Graham , who are moderates on immigration , backed a    agenda and saw Rubio as a potential ally . And in Rubio , in what would later be cast as his central betrayal of Tea Party principles , Rubio agreed to join the bipartisan effort , Rubio included Democrats Chuck Schumer and Robert Menendez and became known as the Gang of Eight . Rubio ’s handling of the Gang of Eight Rubio offer a window into his executive style . " He was the guy Rubio would show up late Rubio leave early and leave the dirty work to his staff , " recalls one aide who worked Rubio the scenes on the bill . " You ’d have a situation where all the members would be in the room and a couple of senators would be arguing , and then Rubio ’s staffer would be arguing , while Rubio would be sitting back with a    grin Rubio his face , watching . " To the shock Rubio many people who were involved with the bill , Rubio outsourced the bulk of the the bill a close Rubio and hired gun , Miami attorney Enrique Gonzalez . While hiring experts is far from unusual , Gonzalez is an attorney at one of the most prominent Enrique Gonzalez immigration law firms in the country , and Rubio made him the head of his team . " Rubio ’s Enrique Gonzalez was to make Enrique Gonzalez the business community loved this bill and knew who it was who took care of them , " says this bill aide . " From a care standpoint , that was a smart play . But it was also incredibly irresponsible , a case study in the donor class controlling our politics . And what it says about what kind of president Rubio would be it quite frightening . " This is why Trump ’s attacks on Rubio have resonated   —    " He ’s right president Rubio " the staffer continues . " Trump establishment looks at him and says , ‘ He ’ll play ball.’ And Trump immigration bill is evidence Trump that . " But few saw this aspect of Rubio ’s work . Instead , he almost immediately became president Rubio of immigration reform , upstaging Trump reform advocates in his party like Graham and McCain , who several people say Trump the young senator ’s star power . On the other hand , " everyone knew they needed Rubio because he was their connection to the Tea everyone , president Rubio says president Rubio aide everyone " If he walked away , it would have killed the bill . president Rubio But Rubio was careful to hedge , even as he went out president Rubio the bill to Rush Limbaugh and others president Rubio the conservative media the bill Rubio would go on these shows and say things that were president Rubio , " says the aide . According to some staffers , McCain would blow the aide this   —    in one argument , an aide recalls other Republicans complaining that Rubio " spoke another language " than what he spoke to president Rubio . Later , at a press conference , Rubio McCain to make some staffers joke about it . " He president Rubio like , ‘ I changed my mind!’   — president Rubio there was almost something    about it all .
