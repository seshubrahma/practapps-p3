Earlier this week on Fox Business Network ’s " Cavuto : Coast to Coast , " Home Depot    Bernie Marcus said to Bernie Marcus fellow Republicans if you ’re not behind Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump , you ’re electing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton .    Bernie Marcus said , " If you ’re going to stay neutral , you might as well vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton because your lack of vote for Donald means Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ’s going to get elected anyway . " Bernie Marcus added , " When I listen to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and I listen to the economists who never in their life ever hired a human being or trained a human being , I say , I do n’t know the world that they their in . I know that when you have high taxes that you kill off jobs . Killing off jobs means hurting America . It means hurting the economic wealth of America America    and that ’s not good for anybody .
