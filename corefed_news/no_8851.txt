Sunday on ABC ’s " This Week , " while discussing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ’s Friday night comments describing half of Republican nominee Donald Trump ’s supporters as " deplorables " driven by " racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamaphobic " beliefs , Bloomberg Politics    editor John Heilemann said Hillary Clinton ’s comment " kind of gets very close to the dictionary definition of bigoted . "   John Heilemann said,"Comparatively speaking , Hillary Clinton apology was relatively clean . I do think it violates the kind of fundamental campaign tenet , which is it ’s fine to attack your opponent , but you should really stay away from attacking the electorate . The other thing that ’s problematic about it is this is that Donald Trump has attacked Hillary Clinton as a bigot over and over again , right ? And there ’s no real   —    there was never before this moment , there was never a time in which you could   —    you could kind of justify that , where Hillary Clinton had said anything that actually kind of met the dictionary definition of bigoted . But this comment kind of gets very close to the dictionary definition of bigoted , so it gives Donald Trump a this comment point that Donald Trump will go back to again and again .
