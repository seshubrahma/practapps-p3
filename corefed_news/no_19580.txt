’   ’ ’    Emerging economies were once seen as being . ’ "    Gradually ,   as the global economy tanked , the     and   of emerging economies    became exposed for all to see . Goldman Sachs economist Jim    O’Neill was quite notably . " ’    Today , Goldman Sachs economist Jim   O’Neill is betting again on emerging markets , albeit on a    select few countries and in a more cautious tone . India ,    Indonesia , and Philippines are the new favorites ,    which all set to become " Asia ’s next domestic    growth stories . " ’ ’   ’ ’is expected to grow at an annual rate      of 1 . 5 % over the coming decade in each of the three " countries      boosting the three" countries      economies . Others , however , are less      optimistic about .    ’ ’   ’ ’      The second tailwind is . All      three countries today lag far behind developed countries in      terms of productivity and per capita income giving All     three countries a      chance to grow faster ( from a lower base ) . Goldman      recommends " [ t]argeted and sustainable infrastructure      investment " to close the gap .    ’ ’      Low private sector debt is another tailwind . " India ,      Indonesia and the Philippines are starting from " Goldman      says , compared to countries      like   ’ ’   ’ ’      Finally , the   protects countries     like  ’ ’  ’ ’      from external shocks . " [ T]he low         ratio in these economies mean that these economies are      relatively less sensitive to a slowdown in global trade or      potential trade protectionist policies under the US Trump      Administration , " according to Goldman      .    ’ ’      Going forward , Goldman      sounded optimistic about the pace of      reforms in all 3 countries citing " progress on key reforms      including measures to increase infrastructure investment , ease      FDI policies , ease doing business and simplifying bureaucratic      processes . " However , Goldman      warned that " ultimately the single      biggest driver of growth in these economies will be the extent      of reform implementation . "    ’ ’   ’ ’      Goldman also referred to favorable    factors ; all 3      countries are experiencing cyclical recoveries helped by global      tailwinds ( low oil prices , loose US monetary policy ) . But      it expects growth in Philippines to be the strongest at 6 . 7 %      thanks to strong private spending and India’ ’s expected      underperformance after the    cash      crunch . India and Indonesia , on other hand , have lagged when it      comes to encouraging private investment spending despite      favorable monetary policy " partly due to weak capacity      utilization levels , " Goldman noted .    ’
