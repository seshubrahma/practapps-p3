Friday on Fox News Channel ’s " Hannity , " former House Speaker Newt Gingrich discussed the possibility of the Trump administration doing away with the daily press briefing , an idea floated by President Donald Trump in an interview set to air Saturday night with the network ’s Jeanine Pirro .   former House Speaker Newt Gingrich offered former House Speaker Newt Gingrich idea of what could be put in place of the press briefing and warned against getting sucked into " dancing with the elite media , " which former House Speaker Newt Gingrich likened to " dancing on the quicksand of the swamp . " " [ M]y point would be this   —    one of them ought to go in every day , and give out the list of things that have been done , maybe introduce a cabinet officer or a subcabinet officer or somebody who ’s done something positive , " Gingrich said . " them should take the country through all the positive things them ’re doing , and then leave , but not have the press corps there , simply give a briefing . It ’ll be on YouTube . It ’ll be on Facebook . It ’ll be   —    may well be on    every day , and say to the press corps there , You take any part of this you want , but we ’re not answering your questions . " " I mean , the more they get the into dancing with the elite media , the more the ’re the on the quicksand of the swamp , " he added . " And in the long run , that ’s not where the country is . It ’s the country what the country the country . And I think it is , frankly , a dangerous detour for them to play these games with the news media .   Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
