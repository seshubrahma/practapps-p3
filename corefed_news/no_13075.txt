On this weekend ’s broadcast of " Fox News Sunday , " Associated Press White House Correspondent Julie Pace declared that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was in the " strongest position " of the remaining candidates .   Pace said , " I think that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is still in the strongest position of any of these candidates that are left . Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s , according to the AP delicate count , Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s the only one that can clinch the nomination through the regular voting process . At the same time , Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has to do much better than Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s been doing in order for that to happen . There is still room for Ted Cruz in particular to go on a good run in the remaining contacts and get close to Ted Cruz in the delegate count , which would put us in a contested convention fight . She added , " And I think the problem for Trump with what ’s happened over the last week or so is that while Trump ’s been Teflon on a lot of these comments that Trump ’s made , politicians tend to get in trouble when politicians do things that reinforce a negative perception of politicians . And Trump did that on two fronts this week . One was highlighting what seems to be a lack of depth on policy with Trump comments on abortion . And , two , is highlighting problems that Trump has with women . And so I think reinforcing both of those negatives could have problems going forward , but it is important , when you look at the math , to note that Trump is the only one who can clinch through this regular process .
