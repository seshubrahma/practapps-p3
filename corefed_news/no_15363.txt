  ( CNN ) To understand what today ’s news of the House voting to repeal and not quite replace Obamacare really means , let ’s think back to World War II for a moment .   The federal government was worried about    inflation , and so proposed wage and price controls . Labor unions objected . To satisfy workers , the National War Labor Board agreed to exempt    health care from both wage controls and income tax .    That tax benefit was supposed to be temporary . Nearly 75 years is a lot of " temporary . "    The tax break for    health care is worth more the higher one ’s income tax rate , which means it is worth nothing at all to the bottom half of the population , which does n’t have a positive income tax rate .    The tax break for   health care has led to a world in which the    and    are    and the marginally employed       workers ,    and temp workers , the rest of the roughly 30 million Americans under the age of 65 in this category     still have no health insurance .   Flash forward to today . The    of    health care is a tax break worth $ 250 billion a year , nearly $ 3 trillion over a    period , to the top half . Were we to repeal this tax break , alone , America could more than pay to insure all uninsured Americans with the resulting revenues .   What does this have to do with today ’s news ? Today , the House , aided and abetted by President Trump , did not vote to change , repeal or limit the tax break for health insurance for the upper half of Americans , in order to continue Obamacare ’s promise to bring health care to all .    Instead , the the House aided and abetted by President Trump President Trump to cut taxes on the upper half in order to seriously gut the promise of universal health care .   As it happens , the taxes cut were only a third of the value of the tax break that was not changed ( roughly $ 900 billion compared to $ 2 . 7 trillion ) .   In sum , the top earners get to keep their full $ the top earners billion a year of health care tax breaks , the thing that was supposed to be temporary .   The people at the top also get back the $ 80 billion in taxes they were paying The people at the top help the people at the bottom of the income scale get some insurance , the thing that was supposed to be permanent . ( Among these taxes are increases in Medicare charges and a 3 . 8 percent additional tax on investment income , both being collected exclusively from individuals earning $ 200 , 000 or families earning $ 250 , 000 or more annually . )   These are taxpaying households that have benefited and continue to benefit significantly from    healthcare . That only sounds inconsistent , until one sees who wins every time : the top .   The fundamental things apply . And so now , looking to the future , death may be coming sooner to some after today ’s news , as 24 million more might join the rolls of the uninsured . But it seems like Americans can all count on this fundamental thing applying :   Trump , Ryan and    Republicans everywhere will work their hardest to Trump, Ryan and   Republicans everywhere rid of death taxes , so that the heirs of billionaires will never , ever , have to worry about paying taxes again .   Health and taxes may be forever joined at the hip for the most fortunate Americans , and soon the tax man wo n’t even be calling to disturb the billionaires’ blissful peace .
