  ( CNN ) Like a football team that must shake off defeat in order to prepare for the next game , Donald Trump has a short time to get over Donald Trump drubbing in the first presidential debate and get ready for the next . Donald Trump has , instead , been whining like a kitchen blender about the moderator , the microphone and Donald Trump opponent while continuing to draw attention to the worst parts of Donald Trump performance .     Advisors who want Donald Trump to win the next debate , on October 9 , must get Donald Trump to change . But to do this , Advisors who want Trump to win the next debate must overcome the candidate ’s    years of doing things Donald Trump way . To appreciate the daunting nature of this task , consider just 10 things Donald Trump could do to prepare for the next debate , and why it ’s this task Donald Trump wo n’t be able to do any of them . this task ) Accept your defeat in the first debate              Donald Trump likes to say " I ’m a winner " and is not accustomed to losing , which may explain the poor sportsmanship Donald Trump has shown since Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump . Ignoring real poll results that show Donald Trump was swamped , Donald Trump has ordered aides to stop saying Donald Trump lost . Of course , this kind of denial means that no one can ask the emperor to put on some clothes . He wo the emperor look down to see his own the emperor . 2 ) Learn to apologize , When he was the emperor in the first debate what he would the emperor to    about his scandalous the emperor in the " birther " controversy that questioned President Obama ’s citizenship , Trump replied , " I say nothing . " You will search in vain for an example of Trump ever Trump responsibility for the damage he has done to any individual , community or nation , though examples abound . He is he going to learn how to do it now . 3 ) Play by the rules , Manners may not count when you fire people on reality TV , but they matter people a    presidential debate . Trump looked Trump a     as he interrupted Trump witticisms such as " Wrong ! " as Clinton spoke during the first debate . But as Trump told Trump , he believes Trump is Trump same person he was Trump first grade . His advisers Trump not going to get him to Trump into an adult now . 4 ) Act like you want the job , One of the oddest moments in the first the first debate say Trump if he loses Trump election he ’ll Trump get to Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington because he has Trump new hotel there . Someone who wants to occupy the White House should n’t suggest he ’d Trump satisfied with a hotel down the street . But Trump is Trump and always a salesman     not a statesman     and he will Trump pass up an opportunity to get free advertising for his business Trump    5 ) Stop bragging , During the first debate Trump ’s Trump moments included bragging about not paying any federal taxes and about betting on a housing crisis .   As he crowed Trump his wealth Trump he added Trump he was Trump " not in a braggadocious way . " But of course he was Trump . Boasting and bragging are    to debate watchers but they are essential elements watchers Trump ’s personality and he will Trump stop . 6 ) Do n’t make so many faces , On the day after the first debate , body language experts noted Trump ’s negative body Trump and timid facial expression . ( These signals were enough for one reporter to call Trump the loser after Trump the contest with the sound turned off . ) Advisers may want Trump to control his Trump nonverbals , Trump this is not something this    man can do . 7 ) Prepare and practice , Always ready to use a little gamesmanship , Trump allowed his campaign Trump to Trump the fact that he was taking a Trump casual approach to the first debate . He said himself , Trump I Trump you can prep too much for these things . " The result was obvious , as Trump seemed    with Trump arguments or rhetorical parries to use against his opponent . Could Trump do differently ? Trump told me that Trump does n’t like Trump read and prefers to depend on instinct , which makes it ’s hard to imagine he will suddenly become Trump to training . Another person might turn a debate defeat as a moment to learn . This is not Trump ’s way . Trump 8) Update your references , In the first debate Trump referenced Gen. Douglas Trump , who died in 1964 , to make a point about America ’s pursuit of the ISIS terror organization . Those who got As in history , know of MacArthur , but the reference surely bypassed millions who watched the debate . Trump the first debate heard Trump lot about the general when he attended a military Trump in the 1960s , but he needs to update Trump . Given the Trump that he does n’t understand Trump workings of our most vital technology , the internet , modernizing his knowledge base would Trump a big challenge . 9 ) Abandon the Russians , Despite the evidence showing that recent cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee and others emanated from Russia , Trump told the first debate audience , " She ’s [ Clinton ] Trump ’Russia , Russia , Russia,’ but I Russia n’t . " This stand is consistent with Trump ’s earlier sloughing off Trump ’s invasion of the Russia his expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin . Because everything is personal for him , Trump likes Putin in part Vladimir Putin Putin Trump said Vladimir Putin likes him . Vladimir Putin n’t expect Vladimir Putin to Trump his mind about the Vladimir Putin on the Vladimir Putin of geopolitics . They are going to have to insult the Russians personally before he does that . Vladimir Putin ) Be Vladimir Putin , In the first debate , Clinton pointed out his penchant for insulting people and Trump Clinton about " somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds . people and Trump After the debate , Trump decided to make the first debate about using Trump Bill Clinton ’s sex scandal against her . Nastiness does n’t play well in Bill Clinton general election when a candidate must appeal to those beyond his or her base . However being nasty a candidate always a candidate a key element of Trump ’s repertoire , as shown by his Trump Cher , Bette Midler , Rosie a candidate and others . Trump once told me that he does n’t respect Trump people because they do Trump deserve it . He is not most people to become respectful overnight . Trump Among Trump ’s advisers there is one , former New Trump City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , who shares much in common with him . Like Trump , he poses as a Trump man and Trump the Trump to believe that his meanness is a virtue . He is also Trump like his candidate , a Trump man who feels entitled Trump criticize Hillary Clinton ’s lifelong marriage .     Consider Giuliani ’s persona and you see someone who understands Trump on a gut level .   After the Trump debate , he said that perhaps Trump should drop out of Trump two that remain Trump Trump ’s record of bankruptcies and abandoned projects shows Trump is the one bit of advice he might be able to follow .
