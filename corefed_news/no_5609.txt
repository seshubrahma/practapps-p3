On Wednesday ’s broadcast of MSNBC ’s " Morning Joe , " New York Times Reporter and MSNBC Contributor Jeremy Peters stated , " there ’s a lot of frustration privately among Democratic Senators , who will tell you , it ’s incredibly shortsighted of the Democrats " to try to filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuch ’s nomination to the Supreme Court .   Jeremy Peters said , " On the Gorsuch nomination , Joe , there ’s a lot of frustration privately among Democratic Senators , who will tell you , it ’s incredibly shortsighted of the Democrats to block this   —    or to try to block this , they the Democrats n’t block it this of course , and lose their the Democrats to filibuster whoever Trump nominates for the next open court seat . Because you do n’t know what the political dynamics are going to look like . You do n’t know how weak or strong Trump Trump be then . And if you take away the filibuster , and waste it the filibuster this fight , you basically give Trump Trump blanche to nominate whomever he Trump to the Supreme Court the next time around , and that one ’s going to be possibly for the Kennedy seat , and that one determines the makeup of the the Supreme Court So , it seems like a wasted bullet I think , at least this is what I ’m hearing from some Democrats about it in this Senate .
