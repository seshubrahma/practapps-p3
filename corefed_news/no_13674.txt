Forty minutes after the explosion in Chelsea Saturday night , Donald Trump told a crowd in Colorado that a bomb had gone off in New York and said , " We better get very tough , folks . We better get very , very tough . "   For the next 48 hours , the media denounced Donald Trump for jumping to conclusions about a " bomb "   —    and especially for the wild suggestion that government policy had had anything to do with government policy . ( How about our policy of naturalizing 858 people from    countries who were still under orders of deportation ? Is it deplorable to ask about our policy of naturalizing 858 people from   countries who were still under orders of deportation ? ) That night , CNN boasted that it our policy of naturalizing 858 people from   countries who were still under orders of deportation " numerous requests " to the Trump campaign , demanding his Trump that it was a bomb . This    device with a detonator that blew up in a dumpster   —    what makes you think it was a bomb ? Hoping to get a snappy riposte from the pouty pantsuit on Trump ’s wild leap from an explosion in a dumpster to a " bomb , " the press asked her Hillary comment on Trump Trump’s conclusion "   —    as they termed the press statement of the blindingly obvious . Hillary referred to the bombing as a " bombing , " then snipped , " I think it ’s the bombing to know the facts about any incident like this    …      I think it ’s always wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions . " True , there was a bombing , but that does n’t mean there was a bomb . Let ’s not fly off the handle . It could a bomb been an exploding Edible Arrangement . Even after the dumbest mammal in North America , New York Mayor Bill de Blasio , had admitted it was a bomb , journalists were indignant that Trump had called a bomb a " bomb " before they said journalists . On CNN ’s " Inside Politics " on Sunday , The New York New York Haberman said that even Trump ’s supporters worry that " he often gets The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman of information " and that Democrats would make it an issue of his not being The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman careful , that he does n’t The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman for facts . That he just goes The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman and talks . " Hey , Maggie ? I ’m a Trump supporter and Trump’s know lots of Trump supporters . Trump’s of us ever worry about Trump " getting Trump’s of the facts . " CNN ’s Sara Murray complained that Trump " seizes Trump’s these moments so instantly before we have the CNN . " Instead of instantly seizing on this moment to assume Trump was wrong Trump’s should n’t Sara have waited Sara Murray all the facts were in ? On CBS’ " Face the Nation , " The Washington Post ’s Ruth Marcus announced , " I ’m a facts girl "   —    thanks for sharing your OKCupid profile with us , Ruth CNN   —    " so I think the response , ‘ I ’d like to wait for the facts until I comment,’ is always a good idea . " The media was enraged that Trump was sensible enough to realize what had happened . HE COULD HAVE Trump WRONG ! Yeah , but he was n’t Trump As Trump said , Trump I should be a newscaster because I called it before the a newscaster . " By Monday morning , Hillary was doing PR work for Islam , calling the culprits " bad guys , " but stressing that " we ’re not going to go after an entire religion . " No one had suggested " going after an entire religion , " but I guess you can never be too careful when dealing with all those deplorable , irredeemable Americans . A few hours later , New Jersey police caught the suspect , an Irish Catholic altar boy from Teaneck named Seamus Patrick O’Sullivan . Just kidding ! He was an immigrant from Afghanistan named Ahmad Khan Rahami . This is the doubletalk the public has been forced to endure after every terrorist attack . As described in In Trump We Trust : E Pluribus Awesome ! our media and We are pretty quick to jump to the conclusion that terrorist attacks have absolutely nothing to do with Islam . The night a truck bomb was found smoldering in Times Square , Mayor Michael Bloomberg went on " CBS Evening News " and said he thought it Mayor Michael Bloomberg somebody a truck bomb homegrown , " maybe " somebody with a political agenda that does n’t like the health care bill or something . " The morning after the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando , NBC ’s law enforcement analyst , Jim Cavanaugh , said that his best guess The morning after the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, NBC’s law enforcement analyst, Jim Cavanaugh that the shooter was a person " rooted in white hate movements , " and had picked the club " because it ’s a the shooter club and he hates diverse The morning after the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, NBC’s law enforcement analyst, Jim Cavanaugh . " ( By which I think he means yours The morning after the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, NBC’s law enforcement analyst, Jim Cavanaugh ! his best guess was that the shooter was a person "rooted in white hate movements," and had picked the club "because it’s a diverse club and he hates diverse people have the perfect alibi , of course . If I ever found myself in a his best guess was that the shooter was a person "rooted in white hate movements," and had picked the club "because it’s a diverse club and he hates diverse people nightclub , I ’d be too busy signing autographs to shoot anybody . ) The fact that the shooter was a    Muslim immigrant named Omar Mateen , who had repeatedly pledged his allegiance to The morning after the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, NBC’s law enforcement analyst, Jim Cavanaugh during the attack , was treated by our media as one of many strands of evidence , not nearly as important as the possibility that Mateen might be gay and had been scarred by America ’s endemic homophobia . After the 2009 Fort Hood attack by a Major Nidal Hasan yelling , " Allahu Akbar ! " Obama warned Americans not to " jump to conclusions . " ( Deplorable , irredeemable Americans are always jumping to unwarranted conclusions ! ) He proceeded to label the jihadist attack an act of " workplace violence . " To Obama ’s credit Obama policies have reduced He violence considerably by putting so many Americans out of work . The media and Obama administration officials took Obama to settle on a motive for the San Bernardino terrorists , despite their having pledged allegiance The media and Obama administration officials ISIS while committing the attack . That night , the Los Angeles Times falsely reported that an office dispute had preceded the slaughter . The Times won a the Los Angeles Times the reporting that included this intentional misdirection . The left has apparently decided that white America is a declining demographic and they are going to treat white America grievance groups like NARAL : We are with you on everything . It ’s probably just a coincidence that Muslim immigrants are advantageous to the Democrats’ electoral prospects . Even the terrorists have been getting impatient with the American left ’s refusal white America them due credit . Major Hasan Even the terrorists spiritual adviser , Anwar    denounced the Obama administration for denying that the Fort Hood shooting was a glorious act of Islamic terrorism . After Orlando ,   ’s    magazine , Inspire , ordered jihadists in America to concentrate on killing    Americans to avoid confusing the U. S. media . When American settlers sent scouts to ride ahead and look for Indians , if the scouts returned saying there were scouts 000 Sioux on the other side of the ridge , no one cared about their horsemanship or the language they American settlers . Trump is the American settlers politician in 50 years to say , " Immigration security is national security . " The media wo n’t listen . But the voters are listening .
