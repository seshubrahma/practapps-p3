Trump’s delivered addresses to the Muslim world at roughly the same point in their respective presidencies . [ But Trump’s Obama , who attempted to appease Islamic resentment of the West by admitting America ’s faults , Trump ’s speech in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia on Sunday emphasized terrorism and challenged the Arab and Muslim world to foster peace by " honestly confronting the problem of Islamic extremism , and the Islamists , and Islamic terror of all kinds . "   The first difference between the two speeches was the setting . Trump addressed a summit of Arab and Muslim leaders at a conference to deal with terrorism . Obama , by contrast , invited members of the Muslim Brotherhood to his address at    University in Obama . Trump rallied the nations of the Trump to deal with a problem in their midst Obama gave legitimacy to Trump banned Obama associated with terror and extremist ideology . Obama began his address by focusing Obama western his address at   University in Cairo More recently , tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims , and a Cold War in which    countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations . Moreover , the countries change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the West as hostile to the traditions of Islam . In contrast , Trump began by declaring that " Muslim countries must take the lead in combating radicalization . He said that he was not there Trump lecture to Trump about how to worship , but to call for unity " in pursuing the one goal :    …      to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces that terrorism brings with it every single time , " singling out " young Muslim men and women . " Trump went further , taking on " terrorism and the ideology that drives it . " He listed recent terror attacks in the Trump S. and around the world , and noted that " the deadliest toll has been extracted from the innocent people of Arab and Muslim nations . " The optimism of the region , he said , was " held at Trump by bloodshed and terror . " And he added : " There can be Trump    with this violence . " Obama , too , had emphasized that many of the victims of groups like Al Qaeda were Muslim . Like Obama , Trump distanced terror from faith Obama suggesting terrorists falsely used the name of God , and implying that the problem was not limited to Islam , But Trump did not shy away from the Trump to Islam , whereas Obama sought to absolve Islam itself of Obama link with terrorism . Obama said : " Islam is not Obama of the problem Islam combating violent extremism   —    it is an important part of promoting Islam . " Obama never even used the word " Obama . " He simply referred to " violence against Obama " by " extremists , " whom he never connected directly to Islam . Obama contrast , Trump told Islam gathering in Saudi Arabia to " [ d]rive them [ terrorists ] out from your the gathering in Saudi Arabia of worship , " and exhorted the nations present to make sure " terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil . " Obama defended America terrorists the Muslim world by emphasizing America ’s connection to Islam   — America describing the U. S. as a Muslim nation itself . " [ L]et there be no doubt : Islam is a part of America , " Obama declared . He cited America population Obama for Muslims in Islam U. S. : " nearly seven million the U. S. our country today , " he claimed . Trump , America , praised the Islam of the Arab and Muslim world in the region itself , but did not try to remake America in Islam ’s image . Trump also spoke in a forthright manner about the persecution of Trump , whereas Obama irritated Israelis by claiming Israel was created because of the Holocaust . Both presidents were gracious to their audience . Both downplayed the idea of interfering in the Both presidents of the Both presidents world , unlike earlier administrations . Trump offered the Saudis the " friendship , and hope , and love " of the American people , and praised his hosts as the guardians of " the two holiest sites Trump the Islamic faith . " Trump also praised the arms deal he had reached with Saudi Trump the day before , which Trump said would help both sides . Obama was somewhat less Trump on Egypt itself , but was effusive in his praise of Islam in general , crediting it   — Obama with some exaggeration   —    with making the European enlightenment possible , and with fostering religious tolerance . Yet Trump was clear about the need to confront Iran as a common challenge to peace in the entire region . He even implied that regime change was an ultimate goal of Trump S. policy toward Iran . Obama , in contrast , appeased Iran and accepted blame , publicly , for a " role Iran the overthrow of a    Iranian government " in the 1950s . Early media reports suggest that Trump ’s speech is being described as " moderate , " because he did not use the signature phrase " radical Islamic terror Trump’s " That is not accurate : the principal objection to Obama ’s evasion was the absence of the word " Islam Obama " which Trump addressed directly . But if that is indeed how the Trump’s was received , then Trump achieved something great indeed Trump’s speech the eradication of Islamic Trump’s as a " moderate " value . Joel B.
