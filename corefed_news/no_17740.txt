’   ’ ’    Making good on one of his key campaign promises , President Donald    Trump wasted no time in pulling the US . The North American    Free Trade Agreement . ’ ’    The moves align the new administration against " globalism " and    free trade   —    a stance further emphasized by Press Secretary    Sean Spicer’ ’s recent suggestion that a   could help fund    Trump’ ’s proposed border wall . But an examination of US    hotels owned by the Trump Organization reveals just how much US   hotels owned by the Trump Organization    rely on foreign imports , a practice that could come under fire    from    own administration . ’ ’    The rooms in Trump hotels are adorned with furniture and products    that have traveled farther than most guests . Sets of toiletries    in the bathroom were imported from Central America , shipped to    the US from the Trump Hotel in Panama City . Headboards , tall and    grand and often covered in velvet or leather , came from Jiashan ,    China . Light fixtures were brought in from Kamenický Šenov , a    town in the Czech Republic . ’ ’    To track where Trump hotels buy goods , Business Insider consulted     a    company that compiles data from US Customs into proprietary    databases . The resulting list shows Trump ’s businesses have    imported furniture , fixtures , building materials , apparel , and    supplies from more than 15 countries since 2012 . Over the past    two years , the companies have received shipments nearly 50 times . ’ ’   ’ ’    In the president inauguration speech , Trump’s reiterated the president commitment to    domestic manufacturing . " We will follow two simple rules : Buy    American and hire American , " the president said . But that agenda    stands in conflict with the Trump Organization’ ’s business    practices . ’ "    On November 25 , the Trump Doral   —    an    golf resort in    Miami   —    received a    shipment from Hong Kong that    included    covers . In January 2016 , the Trump Doral   the Trump Doral      two containers of massage beds ( 15 , 290 pounds’ worth ) from Moers ,    Germany . In February 2015 , the hotel received 18 , 566 pounds’    worth of      ice buckets with accompanying    lids and trays , sent from Nonthaburi , Thailand , to Los Angeles . " ’    The information about these shipments comes from bills of lading ,    which note everything a ship is carrying as well as who is    sending and receiving the cargo . Michael Kanko , the CEO of    ImportGenius , tells Business Insider that the company compiled    the data by pulling all the records connected with the businesses    and addresses that Trump listed in his Trump      forms . ’ "    " We painted a picture of Trump Trump on foreign imports by    searching our    databases for cargo movements    related to Trump companies Trump " Kanko says . The list is incomplete   —      because products might not have been made in the cities they were    shipped from , and items that arrived in the US by truck or plane    are not included   —    but it does    the globalized nature of the    Trump family ’s hospitality empire . " ’   ’ ’    Trump hotels are not alone in the practice of sourcing    furnishings , fixtures , technology , and supplies from other    countries . ’ "    " It ’s certainly common in the hospitality world to import    supplies and decor from overseas , especially China , " Kano says . " "    Arthur Dong , a professor of strategy and economics at Georgetown    University ’s McDonough School of Business , has consulted for    companies in the hospitality industry , and says people would    probably    shocked by how many components of US hotels come from    foreign sources . " ’    " The irony of this situation is that it’ ’s pretty well known    within the hospitality industries that there are global vendors    who supply many of the hotel chains around the world , " he says it’    referring    the contrast between Trump’ ’s rhetoric and his          practices . ( Four Seasons , Marriott , and Hilton    all declined to comment on their practices . Four Seasons, Marriott, and Hilton   all ’ ’    " President Trump will be , in a sense , hurting some of his own    President Trump interests by putting up these barriers , " Dong says . ’ "    Throughout his campaign , President Trump repeatedly promised President Trump renegotiate    the US ’s    agreements ,    they kill American jobs    by making it easy for companies to move production overseas or    import products from foreign manufacturers . His executive order President Trump on the TPP likely kills that trade deal , which was negotiated    under President Obama but was not ratified by Congress . The TPP    the TPP stronger economic ties between the US and 11    other countries   —    including Japan , Vietnam , Canada , and Mexico    but not China   —    by reducing tariffs and other restrictive    policies for trade between them . " ’    Trump is expected to soon issue an executive order to renegotiate    NAFTA , a deal that eliminated most tariffs on goods traded    between the US , Canada , and Mexico . He has called NAFTA , Trump    was negotiated by George H. W. Bush and later approved by Bill    Clinton , " . " ’ ’    Since World War II , trade deals have been largely embraced by    both Democrats and Republicans because economists have found the    agreements . Until Trump campaigned    in opposition to free trade , most criticism of TPP and other    deals came from progressives like   who   free trade creates winners and losers ,    even though overall gains    outweigh losses . A corporation    may profit from access to foreign markets with lower wages , but    domestic workers could consequently    their jobs . ’ ’ domestic workers Since the election , Trump has stuck with his       rhetoric . On Trump 23 , he suggested he would impose Trump   Trump companies that move their    operations outside the US . In December ,   that Trump ’s transition team was Trump a proposal to instate a 10 % tariff on imports to    increase domestic manufacturing . In a   a couple of    weeks later , Trump suggested he would favor a Trump % Trump on    Chinese exports to the US . ’ "    Yet many of Trump ’s imports come from China Trump ImportGenius’ data    shows that Trump has received 20 shipments from Trump country over    the past China , as well as 17 from Hong Kong . ( The largest    shipment received in 2016 had six containers   —    weighing a    total of 217 , 382 pounds   —    full of Miss    Chi hair    straighteners and hair dryers , which were shipped from Shenzhen    to Houston in September . ) " ’   ’ ’    Susan Helper , a professor of economics at Case Western Reserve    University and the former chief economist at the US Department of    Commerce , says that imposing higher tariffs could lead more hotel    chains to buy things like furniture or light fixtures from US    makers . But that will depend on what kinds of changes the    administration makes . ’ ’    " If there are tariffs just on a couple countries like China or    Mexico , then stuff China Mexico to other countries , " she says ,    suggesting that companies might simply find production facilities    elsewhere or start buying from places that are n’t subject to    higher fees . " If it        tariffs , then you ’d be    more likely to see stuff come to the US . " ’ ’ the US Trump has n’t said much about Trump origins of items in his    hotels , he has Trump acknowledged that his Trump was    manufactured abroad Trump ( Shipping data shows that . ) When pressed ,    Trump has President Trump ’d like to Trump domestically made products but    that it was hard to find them . ’ ’    " They do n’t even make this stuff here , " Trump   after anchor George    Stephanopoulos suggested he should lead by example . ’ ’    George   Stephanopoulos only mentioned apparel and TVs in Trump to that claim    ( it is true that ) but when it comes    to headboards and chairs , there are plenty of domestic    manufacturers that furnish hotels . ’ ’       It ’s certainly very possible and it ’s certainly not difficult , "    says It Wolbert , senior vice president at    which is based in Grand Rapids , Michigan . Wolbert    is quick to acknowledge , however , that furniture is generally    more expensive when made in the US . " The project has to the US budgets that will support it . Everything comes down to budgets . " ’ The project   ’ ’    Kindel , which was founded in 1901 , provided a couple of pieces    for Trump ’s new International President Trump DC : a coffee table and    leather armchair . Wolbert says that while Kindel sometimes makes    pieces for hotels Wolbert    its furniture is so    that the company    usually sells    a few items at a time , rather than furnishing    every room . ’ ’    " We seek to do more commercial work because it helps us grow and    it helps increase volume and more commercial work , " she says . more commercial work It ’s always    great to get that kind of work because it helps    out the    consumer who ’s going to    a sofa one year and then maybe not    buy furniture again for two , five , seven years . " ’ ’    Wolbert says she’ ’s watched many Michigan furniture makers pack up Wolbert    shop , a phenomenon that Michigan says has been the    nationwide .    Trump’ ’s trade policies could shift the market back in favor of US    makers , he says , or even Dong foreign US       establish furniture factories in the US . But companies might also    just start the US overseas and assembling the parts in    the    so that they can get a " Made in the US    and avoid    tariffs companies ’ ’    Wolbert is n’t sure whether policy changes like the ones Trump is    proposing Wolbert    bring Kindel Trump business . But she points out    that there are other good reasons ( besides US jobs Wolbert    for clients    to buy furniture from American makers , since they can deliver and    repair products much faster . ’ ’   ’ ’    Helper says    to domestic manufacturing could even save    money because of those factors . In addition to lowering shipping    costs    she says , eliminating the long lead time provides other    benefits . ’       " What companies sometimes do is order more than they think    they ’re going to need and put it in their warehouse What companies case , What companies she    says . " This is particularly What companies issue in clothing . The       apparel company that ’s importing from China may import three    times as much as they expect to sell China they ’re covered in case    there ’s a The average   apparel company that’s importing from China on demand . So The average   apparel company that’s importing from China ’s just a huge amount of waste . " ’ "    If hotel chains do start buying more    products ,    however , they ’d most likely have to find ways to accommodate the    higher prices hotel chains —    either by cutting budgets elsewhere or charging    guests more . " ’    " The cost will be passed onto the consumer in the way of higher    room rates , because they’’re confronting higher costs on many of    the inputs , " Dong adds . ’ ’ Dong But he says that the president Dong be wise to put his money    where his Dong is , regardless Dong those challenges . ’ ’    " If he doesn’’t start buying from Dong sources , it’’ll ’ ’    look a little Dong hypocritical , " Dong says . " His Dong    would go Dong if he were to direct his Dong managers to start Dong sourcing [ in the US ] and I believe that when they start doing    the US they’’re going to make it very public to make Americans    he were to direct his company managers to start   sourcing [in the US that he’ ’s going to eat his own cooking . " Dong "    It    unclear what effect Trump ’s trade policies will have , on Trump businesses and the US economy . " " Trump " It ’s certainly different and it ’s certainly upending some    assumptions , " Helper says of Trump ’s approach . " And It of it Trump be really bad , but some of it could be OK . " "
