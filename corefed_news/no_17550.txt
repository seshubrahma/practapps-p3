’   ’ ’    Fox News host Bill O’’Reilly raised eyebrows earlier this year    when he   he may not be interested in hosting he ratings    juggernaut " The O’’Reilly Factor " for much longer . ’ ’    When the    heavyweight eventually decides to retire , a    piece of the   heavyweight legacy will live on in a protégé groomed for Fox    News stardom : Jesse Watters . ’ ’    " I think he’ ’s either living vicariously through Jesse Watters , or he’ ’s    reliving things he’ did back in the day , " Jesse Watters said of    O’’Reilly . ’ ’    Over the past decade , Jesse Watters ’’ segments on O’’Reilly’ ’s show   —      dubbed " Watters World " by   O’’Reilly —    have become an integral part    of the broadcast , bookending " The O’’Reilly Factor " twice a week . ’ ’    Ranging several minutes , " Watters Watters World finds the Fox    correspondent interviewing and poking fun at average people on    the street in primarily liberal enclaves , often college campuses    or various neighborhoods in New York City . Recent episodes showed    Watters interviewing Canadians about    Donald Trump    and interviewing veterans at Hampshire College protesting the    school’ ’s decision to take down the flag following Trump’ ’s    election . ’ ’’ "    Watters also Watters as an extension of O’Reilly during ambush    interview segments , unafraid to get into his interview Watters ’s    face with aggressive questions , unrelenting particularly when his    Watters    unwelcome . " ’    " When the cause is just and there’ ’s been injustice , then it’ ’s    easy    kind of galvanize your emotions and confront a guy , "    Watters told Business Insider in an interview in December . " And    it’ ’s it’ and there’ ’s there’ lot of adrenaline involved , but those    usually make a big splash . " ’ "    O’Reilly will often tease the segments , which are stacked at the    back of the program , with the idea that they are a draw for    viewers . " "    According to Watters , O’Reilly generates O’Reilly of the ideas for    the    himself and often has visuals and locations in mind . " ’    " Usually he’’ll say , like , ’’ This is kind of how I want you to    approach it , ’’ and then he’’ll give me one line , and then I have to    fill    the rest , " Watters said Watters " Bill is very understanding of    the    of the segment . I think because he was Bill field guy    for so many years , he’ ’s very interested in aesthetics behind the    ’’ Watters World , ’’ where it’ ’s being shot , why it’ ’s it’ shot    there . " ’ ’    But while Watters described Watters as a banner year for the show ,    with high ratings and interviews with    guests like      presidential nominee Donald Trump , Watters has Watters also    his brand presidential nominee Donald Trump      and ambush interviews    under    scrutiny . ’ "    In October , Watters   over a        segment he shot Watters   New York ’s Chinatown . " ’    Ostensibly dispatched to discuss China’ ’s role in the 2016    presidential election , Watters invoked numerous racial    stereotypes of    for a laugh . He quizzed Watters    about whether it was the " year of the dragon , " inquired about    karate lessons , and asked whether he was Watters to bow to Asian    passersby he saw Watters the street . ’ ’    The segment was   by media outlets and    lawmakers alike   —    The Washington Post dubbed it " , "    while Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said Watters " should be    ashamed " of his conduct . ’ ’    Though he offered his fairly restrained apology in October , Watters    characterized the segment as a mistake and a learning experience . ’ ’    " I was surprised , at the time , with the blowback , " Watters told Watters    Business Insider . " I didn’’t see it coming , and that’ ’s on me . I    understand I did offend a lot of people , and I’’m very sorry for    that    People took issue with some of the statements I made , and    some    the reaction to the Chinatown segment , and I understand    that    And it’ ’s a learning experience   —    I definitely learned a lot    from    .    it’ ’s it’ new day , and we are moving forward with it . it’ ’ ’    He added it’ " It’ ’s it’ controversial segment , ’’ Watters World . ’’ There’ ’s    controversy around it . There’ ’s There’ around Fox , I    understand that . But I listen to people , and I never want to    intentionally    anybody to be upset . It was never my    intention    hurt people’ ’s feelings . And I regret that I did hurt    people’ ’s feelings . " ’ ’    Asked if he would Fox conducted himself differently Fox Watters    paused . ’ ’    " I would , but I don’’t want to dissect this segment   —    I think it’ ’s    been dissected , " he replied Fox ’ "    It was n’t Watters’ first time facing criticism ; at one point , the    Fox News correspondent found himself in Fox brief physical    altercation with Huffington Post editor Ryan Grim over Watters’      ambush of Huffington Post Huffington Post Terkel . " "    More recently , Washington Post media Huffington Post Wemple     for eschewing a    traditional    or phone interview in favor of an ambush .    Wemple took issue with Erik Wemple     decision to stick Watters’      foot into    Erik Wemple     president of Hampshire College ’s private residence during an    ambush interview about the college ’s decision Watters’ decision to stick his foot into   the president of Hampshire College Asked about the criticism , Watters indicated he did not know who    Wemple was and noted that Hampshire reversed course Watters days    after the segment aired . ’ ’    " I’’ll let that speak for itself , " Watters said . ’ ’    Watters added : " I I’’ll pay attention Watters a lot of that stuff Watters    they write . It doesn’’t really bother me that much . I stand by don’’t    work , especially the confrontations . There are heroes and    villains out there in the media landscape , in the news landscape ,    in the political landscape . People sometimes get called out , they    react how the news landscape And I’’m proud of what I do . " People ’    Viewers People " The O’’Reilly Factor " and Fox News have been equally    unshaken by critics , teeing up Watters for perhaps one of his    biggest career    . ’ ’    The correspondent will reprise his role as Watters during Fox’ ’s    New Year’ ’s Eve special , and he is set to make his debut on    O’’Reilly’ ’s nationwide comedy tour . Watters has also been able to he maintain the ratings dominance of " The O’’Reilly Factor " when    filling in for    bombastic host , easily besting CNN and MSNBC    when anchoring    show in December . ’ ’    Watters himself hinted at a potentially larger role at the    network in the coming year Watters ’    " Whatever Fox wants me to do , I’’ll do , " Watters said . " I’’m just    going to keep working hard , keep my head down Watters There may be a few    surprises coming up in the new year   —    you’’ll have to stay tuned    for that . You may be seeing a little bit more of me . " ’       For the moment , Watters is anticipating how the incoming    administration ’s politics will affect many of his        segments Watters which have often revolved around    questioning liberal dogma and Obama administration policies Watters " ’    Though he said that poking fun at the left " never gets old , " he    acknowledged Watters he was " getting a little tired " of soliciting    responses to Watters Obama administration’ ’s Watters . ’ ’    " I think it’ ’s it’ for a change , " Watters said . " I think Donald    Trump is presidential nominee Donald Trump to make Watters World Watters World . Watters it’ ’s    it’ to be a new dynamic on the streets . And that’ ’s something that’ I’’m looking forward to . It’ ’s definitely it’ to turn the whole    thing upside down , and that’’ll be a new challenge .
