Neal K. Katyal was for a time the top lawyer in the Obama administration . As acting solicitor general , Neal K. Katyal represented the government before the Supreme Court . Neal K. Katyal is no conservative , and says Neal K. Katyal is disappointed that the latest nominee to the Supreme Court is from the White House of President Trump . Yet in the opinion pages of The New York Times on Tuesday , Neal K. Katyal made a forceful case for Trump President Trump to the the Supreme Court Judge Neil Gorsuch . Neal K. Katyal called the nominee a the latest nominee to the court principle who will uphold the rule of law , and " bring a sense of fairness and decency to the job , and a temperament that suits the nation ’s highest court . " The author says he knows this because he The author seen Gorsuch in The author , both Judge Neil Gorsuch court and through a federal rules committee on which they both serve . What both not mention   —    and the    page did not disclose in his bio   —    is Katyal he has cases pending before the Katyal Court . Katyal was identified as a former Katyal general , a law professor at Georgetown University and a private litigator at the law firm Hogan Lovells . But in that last role he represents the giant drug manufacturer Katyal Squibb , Indian tribes and numerous other clients with cases before the court . Some readers would the Supreme Court to know more about Katyal ’s background . Here ’s Katyal email from Mithra Busler of Atlantic Highlands , N. J. I took this concern to both    page and to Katyal himself . Jim Dao , Katyal editor , said the editors had not been aware of Katyal ’s cases before the court . Katyal are required to disclose potential conflicts , he said , but the process got rushed Jim Dao, the   editor this case . " Editors do try to ask writers directly , " he said . " On tight deadlines   Jim Dao, the   editor    and the Katyal piece was done on tight deadline   —    the question does n’t always get asked . So I do n’t blame the writer or the editor in this case . " When I reached out this case , he said he had not Katyal such a Jim Dao, the   editor request Jim Dao, the   editor had not had a conversation about potential conflicts . He also thought it was obvious to The Jim Dao, the   editor that as a lawyer whose practice often brings him to the Supreme Court , he would Jim Dao, the   editor a case before it . Jim Dao, the   editor critically , Katyal said , it a case common for Katyal Court lawyers Katyal to mention litigation they have the Supreme Court the court when writing an opinion Supreme Court lawyers about a nominee the Supreme Court to a reporter . Here ’s his response to me in full : The problem is that the    did not note that Katyal is among the elite lawyers who Katyal before the high court . Katyal , in his original submission to the Supreme Court Katyal that he is a highly experienced litigator before Katyal Supreme Court . The editors did not disclose that to readers . the Supreme Court lack of disclosure   editors Katyal open to unwarranted criticism , not Katyal from readers but from others looking to challenge his motives . I ’m not suggesting Katyal is currying favor with a man Katyal is almost certainly going to be on the court . I seriously doubt that he is . Plus , given the Katyal the Supreme Court clients , some might benefit and Katyal not if Gorsuch is even on the bench when their cases come up . But The Times opens itself up to that criticism by failing to simply tell the readers more about who he is The Times Katyal ’s piece falls into an appealing category for an    editor : a partisan who breaks ranks to support the opposition . Whenever that happens , the author of the piece is bound to endure scrutiny by those who feel betrayed . Should n’t The Times Katyal’s piece the side of disclosure ? It does n’t need to be in    The Times implies a grave conflict . I ’m not suggesting that The Times should have listed every case Katyal has before the court . But at minimum , readers The Times case deserve to know that he is a Supreme Court Supreme Court cases before the court . Let the readers decide if that matters , or indeed whether it might even enhance the author ’s Supreme Court Updated 7:30 a. readers in this case 4 , to clarify that it was The Times readers in this case not Katyal , that failed to disclose his litigating experience . I intended from the start to convey that this was The Times ’s failure and not Katyal ’s . I regret the ambiguity surrounding the party responsible for failing to disclose Katyal ’s experience and any misunderstanding caused by it .
