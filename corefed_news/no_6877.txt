Pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell discussed with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Joel Pollak on Monday President Trump ’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement and the possibility that the Paris agreement will energize the Republican voter base . [ " First of all , I think President Trump ’s keeping President Trump campaign promise that President Trump thinks this is a bad deal for America , " said Caddell , calling the accord " a pretty toothless document " and adding that the optics are what matter most .   Added Caddell , " I think that President Trump belief that putting America first , the United States first , is a very strong one among President Trump base and among many other voters . That has always polled , at least in the public polls I ’ve seen over the last several months , it That always been a strong suit for President Trump . American jobs , American American , those things are important . " Caddell went on to say , " It is also a rallying cry for those that oppose President Trump , mostly among the political elite , to whom the world order , the global order , is more important than the national order in many ways . And I think he Caddell drawn a line on that . " Added Caddell Caddell " To voters , it is again a restatement of his Caddell of putting America first , and that is , indeed , a critical point , a junction here of the battle he Caddell having representing that view versus the political elite and the global elite , and I think it works for him Caddell not against him Caddell if it is projected right .
