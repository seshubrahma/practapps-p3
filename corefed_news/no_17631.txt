’   ’ ’    An Italian looking at America ’s political present sees uncanny    resemblances to    own country ’s recent past . ’ ’    In 1994 , a cartoonish ,         —   one with little experience in    politics but a penchant for theatrics —   ran for his own country ’s    highest political office . Despite a checkered business history    ( everything from alleged organized crime ties to tax fraud ) as    well as a tendency to play fast and loose with facts , he was    elected by voters fed up with establishment politicians . ’ ’    Given the similarities to Donald Trump , it ’s no surprise that       observers have turned to Silvio Berlusconi for some       of what is to come for the United States . And because the    Silvio Berlusconi in Italian history is now in the rearview    mirror , Italian researchers Italian well into the postmortem of his    reign . It is n’t pretty . A careful study of Berlusconi ’s TV empire    reveals the manifold ways in which companies can curry favor with    a politician who does n’t give up his businesses A careful study of Berlusconi’s TV empire    as well as the      of policing such   . The results    should further unnerve those concerned about conflicts created by    Donald Trump ’s business holdings . ’ ’    Italy is one of a number of countries that place minimal    restrictions on the business activities of politicians . Thus    Giovanni Agnelli , a major shareholder in carmaker Fiat , was able    to serve as a lifetime member of the Italian senate until his    death    2003 , without divesting his stake his the company    In    Italy , a small number of senators are appointed rather than    elected . ) Likewise , when Berlusconi ascended to the highest    office in the land , he retained ownership Berlusconi his Mediaset    Berlusconi , which owned the three TV channels that presented the main    alternative to    RAI TV stations . ’ ’    The lack of constraints on business interests has its advantages . The lack of constraints on business interests It may allow The lack of constraints on business interests to draw on a broad pool of political    aspirants , for example . But it also creates The lack of constraints on business interests conflicts of    interest , which is why most countries —   the U. S. included —   limit the    business activities of politicians and bureaucrats . You might not    want an    executive devising regulations on fuel standards or    car safety because , consciously or not , he might write    rules    to maximize his company ’s    , not the social welfare .    Perhaps anticipating    Agnelli would do exactly this ,    investors drove    ’s stock price up by over 3 percent when his    lifetime Agnelli    announced . ’ ’    Berlusconi ’s election as prime minister presented vastly greater    opportunities for    than a mere    appointment .    But none of Berlusconi ’s electoral victories Berlusconi’s , so    it ’s more difficult       whether investors thought it would    add to    companies’    . Well    Italians actually cast    their ballots , investors would Italians bid up Mediaset ’s price in    anticipation of a Berlusconi    . ’ ’   ’ ’    A group of Italian and American scholars looked back on the    Berlusconi years for more decisive evidence of corruption .    Berlusconi might have tried to benefit his own companies directly    Berlusconi , say ,    that they received lucrative government    his own companies or favorable legislation . But that would have been easy    fodder for Italian journalists and perhaps a Italian too much for the    country ’s voters . ’ ’    But as the study ’s authors point out , politicians also have less    direct —   and less detectable —   methods at their disposal . They    politicians , in politicians , that a politician might be able to elicit    benefits from companies controlled    others with the presumption    ( though not necessarily the explicit promise ) that the favor will    be returned . It ’s what the study calls " indirect lobbying , " to    distinguish it from the    immediate the study more readily    observable methods that companies    other interest groups    exploit to influence government    like traditional lobbying and    campaign finance . ’ ’    Favors from businesses to politicians are most easily    accomplished when the politician is himself in business , since the politician businesses can , say , buy goods or services from the    politician ’s company at inflated prices ( or sell to them at a    discount businesses . This is why we have laws as well as norms that keep    politicians out of business entirely ( or at least those    businesses they might oversee in their least those    in government ) least those    ’ ’    But Italy ’s weak laws of divestiture allowed Berlusconi to remain    the dominant shareholder in Mediaset throughout his time in    office Berlusconi ( The firm was headed by one of his children . This should Berlusconi again be sounding familiar to an American audience . ) The TV    business , it turns    , was This suited to indirect    lobbying , allowing companies    curry favor with Berlusconi by    overpaying for ads on    network . ’ ’ Berlusconi The Italian media business is also    for enterprising    researchers    to detect likely cases of indirect lobbying .    To understand the study    methodology , consider Berlusconi ’s    election in Berlusconi , after six years of sitting on the political    sidelines . Suppose that Fiat had , during 1995 —   2001 , spent 55    percent of its television ad budget on Fiat commercials and just    45 percent on Mediaset ads . Suppose furthermore that in 2001 ,    Fiat ’s ad spend on Fiat jumped to 60 percent Mediaset leaving just 40    percent for RAI ads ) . The RAI    jump in Mediaset    ads would give us an estimate of how much Fiat was willing to    Fiat its advertising expenditures to " Fiat " Berlusconi . ( We    would also expect ad    to shift away from Mediaset    following Berlusconi ’s Mediaset    . ) Berlusconi    Berlusconi came into and out of office Berlusconi times during the    1993 —   2009 period that the researchers focus on . Using      advertising expenditures from Nielsen ( the same    company that provides TV show ratings here in the U. S. ) for both    Mediaset and its competitor RAI , the study shows   Mediaset , after    accounting for factors like audience share and sector , Mediaset ’s    share of ad spending   Mediaset about 2 . 3 percent higher in the years    that Berlusconi was in office . ’ ’   ’ ’    While this may not sound like much , when multiplied by the    billions spent on advertising during Berlusconi ’s nine years in    power , it adds up to    a billion this in extra Mediaset    profits . The extra revenues were n’t the result of airing more    ads —   Mediaset stations devoted the same fraction of Mediaset    to    advertising regardless of who was in office . Rather , companies    paid consistently higher prices for Mediaset ads when Berlusconi    was in Mediaset    . ’ ’    RAI , meanwhile , was forced to cut prices when Berlusconi was in    power , so Berlusconi    net effect    ad spending was to shift revenues    from the public coffers ( recall that RAI is a      broadcaster ) into RAI ’s pockets . And Mediaset could Berlusconi’s justify the Mediaset    prices because consumers switched their    television allegiances —   audience shares consumers    and RAI held    steady Mediaset    the whole 1993 RAI   2009 period . Further bolstering the    indirect lobbying interpretation , the advertising effect comes    entirely from highly regulated sectors ( like telecommunications ,    pharmaceuticals , and construction ) whose profits are most easily    affected by government action , rather than    regulated ones    ( toiletries , toys , apparel ) . ’ ’    That Berlusconi may have Berlusconi to the tune of a billion euros    from serving as prime minister is particularly galling given that    part of his pitch to voters was that he was already so wealthy    that he his be immune to corruption . Trump his   Donald Trump same line to    disenchanted voters . But as the paper emphasizes , the richer the    politician ( or , more to the point , the more extensive his    business interests ) the greater the potential for him to profit    from holding office . his ’    All of this should be troubling for Americans , especially given    the businesses    Trump happens   Donald Trump be in . Ads on    Mediaset are a boutique product . While it ’s now clear , thanks to    Ads on   Mediaset clever work of the authors of this study , that advertisers    overpaid for Mediaset airtime during Berlusconi ’s terms Mediaset       Berlusconi’s at the time , it was    difficult to detect , as there    was no ready benchmark for the product . ’ ’    Similarly , how a boutique product to know whether companies are overpaying to    license the Trump name   Donald Trump hawk their condos ? Or for a night at    the Trump International in Washington , D. C. ? It ’s difficult to    assess , via stock market responses , whether Donald      Donald Trump victory is likely to be a source of    profits . Trump ’s      Donald Trump ventures are privately held    so there is no    price to    gauge investor ’s intuitions . The value of some of his business    partners’ firms have shot up in value —   for example , his Indonesian    partner in a hotel venture saw its stock his increase 23    percent on news of the his Indonesian   partner in a hotel venture outcome . ’ ’    But given the particular business Trump is in   Donald Trump The Italian media business to know    what to make The Italian media business this . Trump ’s name   Donald Trump imbued with much    greater prestige than it was before Nov. 8 . People may be willing    to pay more Trump’s name a    condo or hotel room in New Delhi    or Washington , D. C.    if they are n’t attempting to curry    favor with him D. C. just as in People ’s Italy , corporations    with business Berlusconi’s D. C. will have ample    opportunity to indirectly lobby the president through his    complicated D. C. of business interests . ’ ’    Trump made it abundantly   Donald Trump the president    ’s news conference    that he has no intention   Donald Trump unraveling this tangle of conflicts .    As his lawyer explained ,   Donald Trump himself of ownership could   Donald Trump expose Trump to "      Donald Trump . " ’ ’    This makes it all the more likely that political office will    prove to be just as profitable for Trump as it was   Donald Trump his fellow      in   Donald Trump . ’
