The media latched on to a few absurdly overblown stories to keep the bad vibes flowing during President Trump ’s first overseas journey . Editorial judgment is apparently easy to suspend when the opportunity to hype an odd photo or curious video clip presents the opportunity to hype an odd photo or curious video clip . [ The Orb : By far the most entertaining    was the photo of President Trump , King Salman of Saudi Arabia , and President Sisi of Egypt posing with their hands atop a mysterious glowing white sphere .   Internet wags had a field day coming up with humorous theories about the Orb , including the lively wag subdivision of Breitbart News , whose contribution made the New York Times roundup of    merriment . A good time was had by all , but really , there ’s nothing terribly mysterious about the Orb . It ’s not a relic from some obscure desert nomad ritual given a    gloss by the Saudis , or an alien artifact , or a leftover prop from the Lord of the Rings films . It It just a translucent globe of the Earth with a very bright light inside , which makes it look weird in photographs . It It part of the decor at the    new Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology in Riyadh , and the three leaders were posing for a routine photo op . Evidently the management of the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology has a keen sense of drama , as the New York Times describes the scene : " When the king and Mr. Trump touched it , background music of the kind that might accompany a reality show ’s elimination sequence or introduce a cable news program soared and pulsed . The screens glowed with statistical displays and videos about fighting terrorism . " That orb is destined to show up in a lot of selfies . The First Lady swats President Trump ’s hand away : Shooting wars have gotten less coverage than a few seconds of video that appeared to show first lady Melania Trump evading President Trump ’s attempt to hold her hand on the tarmac in Tel Aviv , while walking the red carpet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his President Trump’s Sara . CNN analyzed what it attempt to hold her hand on the tarmac in Tel Aviv " the swat heard round the world " as if it attempt to hold her hand on the tarmac in Tel Aviv the Zapruder film , offering a variety of theories as to the meaning of Mrs. Trump ’s 1 . 5 seconds of body language . Verdicts ranging from " awkward " to " she Mrs. Trump his guts " were rendered . Mrs. Mrs. Trump facial expressions and posture were scrutinized for signs of her dismay Mrs. Trump the business of being first lady . Signals from distant stars that might host intelligent alien life are examined less carefully than the signals Melania Trump Mrs. Trump sending . As for the     well , the " experts " see nothing but brutish misogyny in his body language Mrs. Trump None of that has anything to do with what people who actually know the Trumps say about the state of their marriage , but why let common sense ruin a good news cycle ?   If anyone needed further evidence that a great deal of modern reportage is driven by whatever " viral sensation " happens to float across the Twitter and Facebook pages of journalists , here it is . Hundreds of pages of news and commentary milked from one second of video is the best return on minimal effort since Jack planted a handful of magic beans and grew a beanstalk that punched through the stratosphere . Trump    the President of Montenegro : The media flipped out over video from President Trump ’s Trump   the President of Montenegro NATO headquarters in Brussels that showed Trump apparently shoving the Trump   the President of Montenegro Prime Minister Dusko Markovic of Montenegro aside , so Montenegro could claim a the hapless Prime Minister Dusko Markovic of Montenegro position in a group photo shoot . " The Balkan state is in the process of formally joining NATO , but membership NATO it seems , does not earn it a spot at the front of the line , " sniffed the New York Times . Now that you mention it , no , it nations that are n’t even part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization yet would not normally stand in front of the     of the global hyperpower in a NATO group photo . Also , group photos are arranged by photographers and diplomatic staff , not shoving contests between world leaders . Of course , most of the media types trying to make hay out of the Trump Shove know this , since they work with photographers on a regular basis . Alas , even as new heights of media dudgeon were reached , Markovic ruined the fun by declaring he was not offended Markovic Trump ’s pat on the arm . " It did n’t really register . I just saw reactions about it on social networks It It is simply a harmless situation , " Markovic said . Then Markovic blew up the Markovic of the narrative by noting , " It is natural that the president of the United States is in the front row . " Trump attempts to dismember Trump president with brutal handshake : Not content with tossing the Prime Minister of Montenegro around like a sack of potatoes , Trump also came close to crushing the new French president French president NATO summit . According to the Washington Post , the only reason President Emmanuel Macron did n’t draw back a stump is that he was warned in advance about Trump President Emmanuel Macron gorilla grip Trump ensuing encounter featured some of the most spectacular     combat since Agent Smith faced off against Neo at the subway station :   Macron strides along the blue carpet to the wall of world leaders walking toward him . As the president of the United President Emmanuel Macron stretches out his arms in a " hey , buddy the president of the United States " greeting of the newest member of the elite club , Macron veers to the right like a decoy Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House . Trump looks on as his French counterpart double kisses German Chancellor Angela Trump and shakes hands with other leaders . When Macron does get around to greeting Trump , Macron goes for the    . Trump yanks Trump and employs his left Macron to try to hold down Macron Donald ’s rising right arm as the insecure alpha tries to assert his dominance as cameras clicked . President Macron Macron but a student of   Macron is the master . Macron had to parkour his way across half of Macron headquarters to escape Macron Melania countered Trump ’s iron fists with a mere twitch of Melania fingers . Veils at the Vatican : Melania Trump could Melania so easily evade the misogyny of the Catholic Church . The breathtaking hypocrisy of the Trump White House was laid bare when Mrs. Trump refused to don a headscarf in Saudi Arabia , Melania Trump to wearing a black veil at the Vatican along with Ivanka . How could the Trump women the Vatican dress codes while obeying Catholic ones ? This particular Melania Trump had a short shelf life , because most media organizations already knew the answer . They still tried to milk it with headlines like " Melania Trump Wears most media organizations , But Not a the answer , " but the body text of the very same stories admitted the Vatican ’s dress code is    and well known , while the Saudis did not even request she wear a headscarf . They do n’t make such requests of visiting Melania Trump women as a general the Saudis . Furthermore , as Canada ’s Globe and Mail noted , the Vatican is a holy site , and Mrs. Trump happens to be the Vatican’s She did not visit any holy sites in Saudi Arabia , where head coverings Mrs. Trump the removal of shoes might have been required .   The Trumps also respected religious traditions during their visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem , which has a published dress The Trumps for visitors . Mr. Trump wore a yarmulke head covering when he became the first sitting U. Mrs. Trump to visit the Wall . There are Mrs. Trump main reasons we saw a brief shower of " Veil But No Headscarf " headlines : reporters noticed people were popping off about it on Twitter , they were hoping for a cheap " Islamophobia " hit , and they remembered Donald people criticizing Michelle Obama for not wearing a headscarf in Saudi Arabia people Try Googling stories about Melania and the headscarf from May 20th , and you ’ll see a string of stories from virtually every mainstream media organization recalling that Trump " attacked " or Trump slammed " Mrs. Obama for declining to wear one . They ’re also still pretty sore about conservatives mocking President Obama for bowing to the Saudi king , so they scrambled to make a story about Trump bowing too . The Trump Hole is They real , but there are some things the media does not forget .
