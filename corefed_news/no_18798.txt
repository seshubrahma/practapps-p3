" Back in 1998 , the world of finance learned a very painful lesson : Models break and markets are n’t efficient . " ’And with the rise of Donald Trump from sideshow to presumptive Republican nominee , politics has learned the same lesson.’ ’   Capital Management was a hedge fund staffed by several Nobel Prize winners that possessed a supposedly unmatched grasp on how markets work . Capital Management had the most sophisticated methods for exploiting any and all inefficiencies , millions and millions of times over . And it Capital Management up.’ ’Spectacularly.’ ’Chronicled at length in Roger Lowenstein’ ’s brilliant book " , " the short version of LTCM’ ’s blowup is that a series of misplaced bets that certain interest rates would converge over time   —    because they always had in the past   —    went against the firm until they they out billions of dollars.’ " LTCM ’s core conceit was that it LTCM’s markets were efficient and any inefficiencies would be corrected in due course . " ’They were wrong.’ ’Trump’ ’s   with a Trump His " supporters "   and much of the spectacle was a farce.’ ’And so Trump was not only written off as a marginal and unserious candidate because he himself is so unserious , but also because Trump outsider candidate with no establishment support and using only his money to fund his campaign could , the Trump goes , win Trump nomination.’ ’In politics there’ ’s an axiom that says " the party decides . " This idea that vague , entrenched powerful interests   —    not the voters   —    determine an election’ ’s outcome is the political field’ ’s    hypothesis.’ " And it was essentially this idea that underwrote months of Trump commentary that effectively followed the simple line that this ca n’t happen because the party wo n’t allow it . The voters the party media can have their the party ( look at Bernie Sanders ) but eventually The voters and the media sets in and the practical candidates that Very Serious People believe are best for the job will be put to the voters . " ’And yet here we are , not a year later , with Trump as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.’ ’’ ’Buoying themselves against this market ideology of deciding parties were not The voters and the media the traditional pundit class but also the newly crowned top dogs of the political commentariat : the data hounds.’ ’In 2008 , Nate Silver rose to fame by correctly calling the election in favor of outsider Barack Obama , a junior senator who overcame the establishment in defeating Hillary Clinton but also topped the face of the GOP , revered Sen. John McCain.’ ’In 2012 , Silver again nailed the election   —    which was Nate Silver really that the election    that so many believed to be a    between Obama and GOP establishment choice Mitt Romney.’ ’But this time around Silver failed.’ ’On the GOP , : " To me , the most surprising part of Trump ’s nomination   —    which is to say , the part I think I got wrongest   —    is that Trump won the nomination despite having all types of deviations from conservative Trump’s . " ’ ’Nate Cohn at   in a reflection on what    predictions about the Republican contest got wrong.’ ’Which are both ways of saying that it seems the party itself failed   —    the market failed to    its inefficiency , in other words   —    and thus the the party itself undergirded by a belief in a coherent party structure inevitably fell apart.’ ’There was simply no there there.’ ’The statistician George Box once wrote , " Essentially , all models are wrong , but some are useful . " ’ ’This is true.’ " The failure to predict of Trump ’s rise to the nomination , then , is not the fault of the work done by folks like Silver , but a manifestation of the hubris involved in trusting the party over what was happening on the ground . Trump dominated The Party for months , but his place in the Trump as a    outsider who was clearly Trump the choice of The Party seemed entirely untenable . " ’The incoming data was doubted all the way . The model broke.’ " In a   former Wall Street trader Chris Arnade   —    who was among the slick ,    upstarts to hit finance in the 1990s   —    broke down the problem with models , with beliefs , and why Trump ’s imminent nomination is , really , a pie in the face for everybody . " ’The success of Silver in 2008 and 2012 at the time appeared to be the triumph of math over feeling or inspiration . The classic political pundit could   —    still can !   —    anecdotally outline their case for or against a certain candidate . Silver instead brought the data to back up his view . And he was very right.’ ’’ ’But where a    Silver eventually broke down Silver cycle was in doing what all models do : using the past to predict the future.’ " And this is ultimately why Box ’s quote endures . All models   —    even those that are useful and correct for long stretches   —    will eventually reach a point at which the current inputs no longer yield results that look anything like the past . The model ’s guiding light goes dark . The model breaks . " ’Arnade argued Wednesday that this affirms the need for     reporting , meeting voters in real life , getting a feel for just how serious the Trump thing is by talking to people who take it seriously.’ ’Maybe this is the answer . Maybe not.’ " But Arnade ’s point is that using the model as a backstop to affirm your priors   —    that Trump ca n’t win because he ’s not the party ’s choice , that he ’s too unserious Trump too racist , too inconsistent , too everything Trump —    is exactly the point at which the model begins to fail . " ’   Capital Management thought all the model would eventually revert to some efficient equilibria . Then they incurred a revision of belief , and then they were out of business.’ ’  Capital Management , in general , are pretty efficient.’ " ’  Capital Management they are not absolutely so . There ’s an old John Maynard Keynes quote ’  Capital Management says markets can remain irrational longer than you remain solvent . Trump rendered the Republican Party insolvent . " " Business Insider ’s Henry Blodget   that Democrats who are so confident that our next president will be Clinton should be a bit more humble . " " And what I think his post really drives at is that to believe Trump ca n’t beat Clinton our next president be to once again trust the model , Trump the market . Clinton position would require you to believe , just like the GOP did for the last year or so , that the party would decide , that the sensible decision would be made , and the GOP against which you balanced your world would not fall apart into nothing . " " Before 2016 ’s actual voting began , Trump ’s   were somewhat dismissed because , well , . " ’And then Trump lost Iowa . Peak Trump ! The model was going to be right!’ " But this Trump and remains Donald Trump His campaign of    insults exploited what my colleague Allan Smith has called Trump ’s Trump : finding Trump ’s weakness quickly and hammering on it . " ’So Iowa winner Trump became " . " A    Bush political dynasty was destroyed with two unforgettable words : " Iowa " Marco Rubio , the preferred establishment choice for the GOP nomination , became " . " John Kasich was " , " which isn’’t even that catchy : It’ ’s merely true.’ " Cruz ,   ostensibly admitted that he was finally done deceiving voters after he knew he would n’t win their support ’So Iowa winner Ted Cruz " " Jeb Bush ? John Kasich ’s actually pretty low energy . John Kasich is John Kasich , but it voters also true . " " Marco Rubio Jeb Bush at     is n’t short at all , just shorter than Trump , who ’s   . " ’John Kasich did , in fact , win only one state.’ ’But with these schoolyard insults   —    which , again , were mostly statements of slightly inconvenient facts   —    Trump galvanized his base against his opponents , against the party he hoped to represent , and against the truth we all took   Trump be      Trump modern presidential politics.’ ’He upended   Trump party and the " truths " that come along with a political establishment using its heft to nudge voters toward the candidate that has been vetted , supported , put in position to succeed.’ "   Trump broke the model , and now he ’s one vote from the White House .
