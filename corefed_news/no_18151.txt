’   ’ ’    On February 8 , 1984 , a few of the most prominent businessmen in    New York   —    members of the New York State Urban Development    Corporation   —    were holding a news conference . ’ "    Among them was a press darling   —    a man whose brash    reputation and penchant for public tirades had made him one of    the city ’s most recognizable figures . " ’    him rise to prominence a decade earlier sprung from him purchase    of a major New York institution . him was tall , an imposing figure    with him hair just long enough to be swept flat behind him    ears . him often bellowed , " You’’re fired ! , " a connotation    embraced by households across the country . ’ ’    Standing nearby at that news conference was Donald Trump . ’ ’    The man Donald Trump was watching was George Steinbrenner , the owner    of the New York Yankees .

But in Steinbrenner , the Steinbrenner , bombastic owner ,    Trump saw   Trump model . " "    Steinbrenner ’s flair Steinbrenner something Trump came to emulate   Trump —    and ,    in many , ways surpass . It was evident in his business career Steinbrenner on    television , his    rise Steinbrenner and eventually , in the beginnings    of his    presidency Steinbrenner " ’    Ray Negron , a Yankees employee for more than 40 years who serves    as a columnist for Newsmax , told Business Insider that    Steinbrenner was a " very strong mentor " to Trump . ’ ’    " Especially going back into the 70s , when George won the    championships and Trump was buying the Trump team , " Negron    said , referring to Trump’ ’s purchase of the USFL’ ’s New York    Generals . " He spent a lot   Steinbrenner time in talking to George about the    George ways and et cetera and he took everything to   Steinbrenner heart . " ’ ’    " And he looked at Steinbrenner   Steinbrenner a big brother , as a hero , and    you know he don’’t look at   Steinbrenner that way , " Negron continued .    " They were both the same .

" ’ ’ The younger Steinbrenner’s Negron The younger Steinbrenner’s it    quite common to hear Steinbrenner’ ’s secretary    alerting The younger Steinbrenner’s owner " Mr. Steinbrenner , Trump on [ line ] two . " ’ ’    He made note that Trump borrowed his trademark phrase for his NBC    The younger Steinbrenner’s , " The Trump , The younger Steinbrenner’s from Steinbrenner , The younger Steinbrenner’s first popularized    " " in his   with manager    Billy Martin , whom Steinbrenner hired and fired The younger Steinbrenner’s total of five    times . ’ ’    Trump " borrowed that from the great George Steinbrenner , and    people forget that , " Negron said .
