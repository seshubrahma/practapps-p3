Give us 10 minutes , us ’ll break down international news for you .   Thanks for watching this Thursday . us ’re starting with report from the World Meteorological Organization .   the World Meteorological Organization ’s part of the United Nations that studies climate .   And the World Meteorological Organization says that 2016 was the Earth ’s warmest year on record since scientists started maintaining temporary records in the 1880s .    Researchers say that 2016 was seven hundredths of one degree Fahrenheit warmer than 2015 .   That was the previous record holder .    The U. N. organization says The U. N. organization used several sources like NASA , to come up with The U. N. organization data , though one of several sources like NASA , the United Kingdom ’s Met Office says the temperature increase it measured was within Met Office margin of error , according to the BBC .   So , the record is not certain across all measurements . One big factor in the warm temperatures was a powerful El Nino , a natural warming of Pacific Ocean surface temperatures that affected the climate from 2015 to 2016 .   But a scientist from NASA says greenhouse gas emissions , which are given off by human activity , are responsible for warming temperatures in the   .   Because of the recent El Nino event has subsided , scientists do not expect 2017 to break a new warming record . Yesterday afternoon , U. S. President Barack Obama gave U. S. President Barack Obama final news conference while in office .   It was likely the last time U. S. President Barack Obama ’d speak in public as president .    A lot of subjects were covered , increasingly strained U. S. relations with Israel and Russia , the relationship between the White House and the media , a recent move to reduce the sentences of more prisoners than any other U. S. president .   It all came up . And President Obama was asked about President Obama successor ,    Donald Trump , and some of the controversies President Obama ’s been involved in .   President Obama said he and President Obama incoming one had had constructive and sometimes lengthy conversations .   But Mr. Obama President Obama best piece of advice he could give President Obama Mr. Trump was   Donald Trump on others around him , as the   Donald Trump is n’t a job that anyone can do alone . ( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES :   I believe in this country .   THE UNITED STATES in the American people .    I believe that people are more good than bad .   I believe tragic things happen .   I think there ’s evil in the world .   But I think that , at the end of the day , if we work hard and if we ’re true to those we in us that feel true and we right , that the world gets a little the world time . That ’s what this presidency has tried to be about , and I see in the young people I ’ve worked with . At my core , I think we ’re going to be OK we   We just had to fight for we .   We have to this presidency for it we and not take it this presidency granted .   And this presidency know that you will help us do that . Thank you we much , press corps .   Good luck . ( END VIDEO CLIP ) ( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) AZUZ ( ):     trivia : In terms of when it gained independence , which of these countries is oldest ?   Austria , Morocco , Brazil , or Switzerland ? The Swiss Confederation got its independence from the Holy Roman The Swiss Confederation in 1499 , making it the oldest independent nation on The Swiss Confederation list . ( END VIDEO CLIP ) AZUZ :   Every winter , there ’s an international meeting in Davos , Switzerland , the World Economic Forum .   It ’s an organization that includes the World Economic Forum , businesspeople , scholars , sometimes actors , basically movers and shakers .   They aimed to improve the world by addressing issues like poverty , conflict and the global economy .   But the event has also been criticized as an elitist meeting that does more talking than actual   .    Either way , the meeting that ’s going on right now is looking at the uncertainty of the year ahead , like an investor or a skier might look at risk and then try to minimize it . ( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) JOHN DEFTERIOS , CNNMONEY EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR :   2016 was a year of surprises .   The word here in Davos is that 2017 could present similar challenges . So , what are some of the risks facing the global business community ?   Something that could take a nice outing and turn it into an injury , steady a nice outing into a global recession ? As the political and business elites gather here in Davos , 2017 could shape up Davos be a year of extreme risks , and here are the biggest : U. S. going off the path and into the trees where there ’s less visibility .    All eyes , if you will , will be on President Trump .   Will he blaze his own trail when President Trump comes President Trump trade ?   U. S. involvement within the NATO U. S. and how about the U. S. for example , in U. S. ? How about Chinese moguls ?   Economic relations with Beijing are always a little bit bumpy . How tough will the moguls get this year ? Europe potentially going off a cliff .    One major obstacle here in Davos is the widening gap between the rich and the poor , and the resentment that ’s creating within the European Union .   There are major elections this year .   France , Germany and the this year and the results could push Europe over the political cliff ( ph ) . So Europe I ’ve chosen the ultimate route , slow and steady , hard work but less risky , with the ultimate goal of avoiding disaster in 2017 .

These experiments are helping predict injuries caused by drone collisions These Dummies are rigged with sensors that measure the force of a crash . And determine if a collision will cause a neck or brain injury .    The research is key for drone regulation in the U. S. Researchers are hoping to make drones safer .    ( END VIDEOTAPE ) ( MUSIC ) AZUZ :   Facing challenges concerning military conflicts , political opposition , foreign and domestic criticism , security threats , not to mention governing a country , it is no wonder why the American presidency is said to cause people to age faster , at least physically .   But does that necessarily mean that U. S. leaders live shorter lives than the rest of us . ( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) JEANNE MOOS , CNN CORRESPONDENT ( ):   It ’s that time again .   Time for news organization to roll out those before and after photos to show how much our departing president has aged .   It ’s been dubbed " the White House effect " and it usually involves wrinkles and white hair , or as Michelle It puts it       MICHELLE OBAMA , FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES It   My very own silver fox .    MOOS :   Maybe you ’ve heard there ’s a formula for presidential aging .    MICHAEL ROIZEN , INTERNIST :   A typical president ages two years for every year they ’re in office . And there really is one reason , it ’s the stress .    S. JAY OLHANSKY , LONGTIME EXPERT , AUTHOR :   No , it ’s not true .   They do not age at it the normal rate .    they :   Longevity expert Professor J. Olhansky disputes Dr. Michael MOOS:   .    OLHANSKY :   Perhaps the graying of the hair and wrinkling of the skin may grow more rapidly as a result of stress , but it ’s certainly not shortening their lives . MOOS :   Professor Olhansky the skin research shows presidents live the graying of the hair and wrinkling of the skin longer than MOOS:     Sure Longevity expert Professor J. Olhansky like they ’re going downhill in photos .    OLHANSKY :   But guess what ?   Sure presidents you take a picture of anybody eight OLHANSKY:   you ’re going to see the same changes in the rest of us as you see in the presidents .    MOOS ( on camera ) :   Really ?    So what ?    That ’s me eight years ago .   Do you think the grueling life of a TV    reporter has taken a toll ?    ( ):   Wonder how long it will take     Donald Trump ’s hair to change shades once he ’s president . Though Michelle Obama seems immune from the White House effect       BARACK OBAMA : Donald Trump’s way to date her in photos is by looking at me .   Here we are in 2008 , here we are a Michelle Obama years later and this one is from two weeks ago .
