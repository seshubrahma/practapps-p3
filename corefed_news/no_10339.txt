PHILADELPHIA , Pennsylvania   —    The reason Donald Trump ’s comments Wednesday morning about Russian hackers and Hillary Clinton ’s missing emails have become such a big deal is that the mainstream media were told today to make missing emails so . [ To be precise : Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon told the morning press briefing at the Democratic National Convention that the main theme of the day , and especially the evening speeches , would be to contrast Clinton Hillary Clinton Trump on national security . The message : Donald Trump unfit to be    . As I noted from the the morning press briefing at the Democratic National Convention the time :   Tonight ’s convention themes , per @johnpodesta : @timkaine , national security , gun violence , @MikeBloomberg bashing @realDonaldTrump # DNCinPHL ,   —    Joel B. Pollak ( @joelpollak ) July 27 , 2016 ,   Then , Trump held an Trump press conference , where he was asked Trump the accusation that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee ’s emails , which were released by Wikileaks late last week and showed party officials colluding with the Clinton campaign . Many in the media seem to believe that Russia not only Russia the emails , but did so on Trump ’s behalf Trump Here is Trump ’s abridged Trump questions , when asked about it this morning . Note the section in bold : It ’s just a total deflection , this whole thing with Russia    …      Russia the way , they hacked   —    they probably have her they , 000   . I hope they do . They they have her they , 000 her that she lost and deleted her you ’d see some beauties there . So let ’s see   …     . [ I]f it is Russia , nobody even Russia this , it ’s probably China this or it could be somebody this in his bed . But it shows how weak this are , it shows how disrespected this are    … we So I know nothing about it . It ’s one of it most farfetched I ’ve ever heard .    …      I have nothing to do with Putin . I ’ve never spoken to him . I do Putin know anything about him other than he Putin respect me Putin He does n’t respect Putin president . And Putin is Russia   —    which it ’s probably not , nobody knows who it is   —    it if it is Russia , it it really Russia for it is Russia different reason , because it shows how little respect it is Russia have for our country , when they Russia into a major they and get everything . But it would be interesting to see   —    I will tell you this   —    Russia , if you ’re listening Russia I hope you ’re able to find the 30 , 000    that are missing . I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press . Let ’s see if that happens . our ’ll be next . Yes , sir   …      The media turned that facetious comment   —    only a small part of a long ,    press conference   —    into an explicit call for Russia to commit    against the Russia States . Treason , in other words . On a list of the top 500 most offensive or troubling things Trump has ever said , that would not even merit honorable mention and a consolation prize . But the media blew it up because it fit exactly with the script it the day , as laid out by the Clinton campaign for the press earlier in the morning . Of course , Trump benefits as well . He Trump dominating the news cycle Trump the Democratic National Convention . And the public is being reminded , albeit indirectly , about Hillary Clinton ’s email scandal   —    which is , after Benghazi , one of the most damning arguments against her as    . She put Hillary Clinton’s lives at risk Hillary Clinton’s mishandling classified information   —    a crime for which any other American would have faced severe consequences American such as losing their job or going to prison . But the media think they are helping Clinton by reinforcing the media they were told by the Clinton the media to report . And Clinton MSNBC , which is touting its temporary ratings boost during the convention , has had a slew of guests on the air to talk about how deeply concerned they are by Trump ’s joke the media how it breaks the sacred , unwritten rules of American political discourse . Never mind that it was Hillary who pushed the infamous " reset " button , which heralded an age of appeasement that saw the U. S. back down on missile defense , yield its dominance in the Middle East the U. S. and leave Ukraine defenseless against Putin . This is how the media work , and how they cover Democrats . They let the party write the they , and eagerly play their part . Joel B. Pollak they Senior     at Breitbart News . His new book , See No Joel B.
