On Breitbart News Saturday , hosted by Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon on SiriusXM Patriot , Stephen Miller , the former communications director for Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and current senior policy advisor to GOP frontrunner Donald Trump , slammed donor    Sen. Marco Rubio ’s incessant efforts to force mass immigration and open borders on the U. S. at the expense of American lives and jobs . [ " First of all , let ’s remember the warning of Rush Limbaugh , who said if Rubio Sen. Marco Rubio’s president , within 12 to 18 months , the entirely of the donor class agenda will be implemented , " Miller said .   He Miller that agenda in detail as : Mass immigration , open borders , amnesty , TPP [   Trade partnership ] and even more globalist trade deals , and the destruction of U. S. sovereignty . Understand , everyone listening today : There is a point of no return . It is not far away . It It right in front of you . And if you cross it , there is no going back . Marco Rubio ’s career has been a career of deception for the singular purpose of advancing his Marco Rubio’s career ambition and financial standing and campaign fundraising in order to put him Marco Rubio’s career a position to end forever the existence of the United States as a country with sovereign , protected , secure , defined , certain boundaries . In Florida , Mr. Marco Rubio’s a bill to block sanctuary cities . How many Floridians today have been wounded or maimed or lost a loved one because Marco Rubio Marco Rubio’s fight to help the bill to a bill to block sanctuary cities cities ? Who is their voice ? Marco Marco Rubio didn’t fight to help the bill to stop sanctuary cities pushed Marco Rubio’s    tuition to illegal aliens . How many young people in Florida today are in Florida because that money has been held off from them so Marco Rubio could How many young people in Florida Marco Rubio’s of the Florida legislature to find a Florida to discount tuition for illegal immigrants , instead of fighting for his state ’s own legal residents ? Marco Rubio , when he saw an opportunity , Marco Rubio’s against Charlie Christ for pushing the DREAM Act . Then he came to the Senate Marco Rubio’s and the first major thing he pushed was the DREAM Marco Rubio’s . Then he the DREAM Act , Marco Rubio’s Schumer , and Barack Obama to push through the Senate the worst immigration bill in the the Senate these United States . And had it become law , America would be decimated . the worst immigration bill in the history of these United States he lied about these United States provisions Marco Rubio’s that bill not once , not twice , not the worst immigration bill in the history of these United States , but day , after day , after day , after day . As Phyllis Schlafly said : Marco Rubio ’s claims about amnesty , his deceptions , exceeded Obama ’s claims about Obamacare . Marco Rubio’s about that for a second . And then he treated law enforcement , in the words of Chris Marco Rubio’s , " like absolute trash . " How can you have a GOP nominee who demonstrates that kind of disrespect ? Miller continued , explaining who Chris Crane is : [ Crane ’s ] a Marine Chris Crane ’s a lifetime member Chris Crane The Veterans of Foreign Wars Miller And he ’s been elected by his peers to be their voice Miller the country . He Miller been elected by his peers peers , his fellow ICE Miller , to be their his peers the Miller . And if he wanted to , his fellow ICE officers could have the country game . Miller could have gone Miller Rubio and said , hey , Miller ’ll support your bill if you give me some particular benefit . But he did n’t do that . Instead , he asked Rubio Miller protect the national security of the United Miller . He asked Rubio , do n’t give amnesty to the country Do n’t give amnesty to Rubio molesters . Do n’t give amnesty to gang members . And Rubio said , oh , sure , Chris . I ’ll take care of all Rubio . And instead , what did Rubio do ? He left in amnesty for the most dangerous aliens in the Miller Rubio of America . What can you say about a person that treats the country , who misleads the country enforcement in that way , and who does so in an effort to put a bill on President Obama ’s desk to legalize the most dangerous aliens in the United States of America ? Making matters worse , to this day , Rubio says   —    the country it because I the country to get the best bill I could out of the Senate . " His best bill legalizes sex offenders ? His best bill legalizes    gang members ? His best bill is supported by every single Rubio Democrat ? Beloved by Barack Obama His best bill Nancy Pelosi ? Marco Rubio Rubio to His best bill says his best the Senate , is the bill Luis Gutierrez embraces , the Center for American Rubio , that George Soros embraces . That Rubio his best bill His best bill wants to be the president of the United States ? And then he goes on TV and in Spanish says he wo n’t eliminate George Soros amnesty ? His unconstitutional George Soros executive amnesty right away ? And then he pretends he did n’t George Soros that later , when he ’s talking George Soros English ? This is the legacy of a George Soros who is committed to an ideology of globalism so George Soros it George Soros explanation . Bannon asked , " Why George Soros the mainstream conservative media not drilled down on this ? Why are they giving Marco Rubio a pass ? " " Because think tank life in Washington , D. C. is comfortable , " Miller said , adding : I do n’t mean that the mainstream conservative media a mean way . I ’ve got lots of friends in Washington , D. C. whom I have extensive admiration for . But the think tank life is a nice life . You can be a Capitol Hill staffer , then you can Washington work D. C. particular think tank , and then you can be a    GOP strategist on Fox News or some other station , and then you can go be a lobbyist , and then maybe you can go be a consultant , and around and around and around you can go . And you can feel good about yourself because maybe on a Friday night , you go to a townhouse somewhere , and you have an esoteric conversation about the    bank , and think that you ’re really smart and fantastic and fabulous , and give yourself a pat on the back . Meanwhile , Americans are dying in the streets because of our open border . Kate Steinle was murdered in her father ’s arms by an illegal immigrant . But our lawmakers in D. C. and our political system in D. C. and our lobbyists in D. C. have become so desensitized to Kate Steinle abuse of Americans that that horrendous slaughter , in our daylight in the streets of our Francisco , was D. C. to our our political class to meaningful , sustained action . That death was not enough to stir to action Washington , D. C. If you want to stay with that system , if you our to double down on that kind of failure , then there are candidates in this race who can give you that kind of failure for four or eight more years . But if you want to end the fever grip of special interests , and the pollution of donors and lobbyists on our political system , then you have one choice . You have one vote . And you have one chance to put the American citizens back in control of their own future and their own destiny . Listen to the full audio of Miller ’s interview below :
