[ Gainor said , " What bothers me here is how the media became    Puritans overnight . The same people who promote debauched sex , SM , threesomes , foursomes , look at the latest episode of Westworld . The same people who promote debauched sex, SM, threesomes, foursomes have a    foursome in it . The same media that thinks that ’s great and does n’t do anything to tear down the morality of our country , then turn around and say , ‘ Oh , what this guy did was bad . ’ "   " The same people who promote debauched sex, SM, threesomes, foursomes ’re not going to talk about the Kennedys , " this guy went on , " who The same people who promote debauched sex, SM, threesomes, foursomes think were great , when John F. Kennedy was using interns like The same people who promote debauched sex, SM, threesomes, foursomes were party favors , John F. Kennedy results in the death of somebody , and then he John F. Kennedy his John F. Kennedy through Washington in a drunken , debauched state , and he John F. Kennedy the ‘ Lion of the Senate . ’ " You ’ve got to at least be consistent . That ’s a fair expectation , " concluded Gainor . Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern . LISTEN :
