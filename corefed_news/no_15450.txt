But many of President Donald Trump supporters are n’t joining the outcry .    (CNN) spoke to President Donald Trump backers across the country , and while some of Trump backers across the country expressed surprise at former FBI Director James Comey ouster , few said it changed their some of them of the leader of the free world .   Here ’s what they some of them to say : Jake Lee , business owner , Lee , 46 , of West Hollywood , California , said he former FBI Director James Comey Trump made " the right decision " in axing Comey former FBI Director James Comey " As far as the Comey former FBI Director James Comey goes , I think he former FBI Director James Comey him former FBI Director James Comey of chances . I think what became the last straw was when he former FBI Director James Comey Comey ) made that statement about the classified emails showing up on ( Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin ’s and her Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin , former Congressman Anthony Weiner ’s ) laptop . You ca n’t have rules for the elitist ruling class and not have those rules for the elitist ruling class to everybody else . I think in my opinion that was part of ( Trump ’s ) decision . The guy likes to run a tight ship . " As for concerns that Comey ’s firing could affect the investigation into Trump ’s Trump’s Russia , Lee does n’t see it as an the investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia .   " You know , I think ( Trump ’s ) Trump’s lot smarter than that . If he were to Comey him and then Comey . .. the news got out that he was actually Comey with Russia     which Russia do n’t believe so     that would be even worse . The    would be worse than the actual crime , and I do n’t think that he would put Comey in that Comey . The guy , Comey opinion , is super smart . " Scott Preisendorf , construction company owner , Preisendorf , of Windsor , Colorado , is an independent , but voted for Trump . The Comey firing is yet another incident reinforcing his regret over casting Comey ballot , he said .   Comey thinks Comey should ’ve been Comey in 2016 during the Clinton email flap and that it ’s obvious that the Clinton email flap fired Comey " Trump to protect himself . The way Trump was done and the timing ,   I did n’t think it was right .   " I do n’t think he ’s working for Trump people . Trump is using his Trump to make Trump , his family Trump his Trump money . Trump ’s blatant . " " I ’m still doubting Trump will make it Trump years . It Willie Standley , clothing store owner , Standley , 53 , of York , Pennsylvania , says he has no issue Trump Comey ’s firing , although he was surprised by Comey and wonders what effect his ouster will have Comey the investigation into Trump ’s Russia ties . He also thinks the Comey has become entirely too political .   " I think we should take the politics out of it . Get a the politics investigation to go out there and get the truth to go ahead and serve America , not the politicians . " When a person is in office they should have people around them that are going they go ahead and support what they stand for . they own my own business , and if someone went ahead and undermined me and my business , I would fire them too . " my own business , however , would like to see a special investigation into the firing .   " Something is definitely not right , because the timing and everything is not good . . .. Something smells with Trump . I do n’t have blind loyalty     no way     because . .. I do n’t trust politicians . And that ’s part of why I voted for ( Trump ) because Trump Trump politician . Trump once he stepped in there doing the Trump that he ’s done . .. he Trump going at it like Trump politician , not a businessman . " So , after the ordeal , is Standley still happy he cast his vote for Trump Trump " Trump would say Trump ’s early on , but no . But I still think he ’s going to be better Trump Hillary would have been . Time will tell . " Shawn Lewis , tattoo parlor owner , Lewis of Whitesburg , Kentucky , says he does n’t know how to Shawn Lewis, tattoo parlor owner, Lewis of Whitesburg, Kentucky about the Comey firing .   " I think even if Hillary had been there , if Hillary had won , he ( Hillary ) would have Hillary gotten fired over . .. everything that went through that . I guess he ( Trump ) could have Hillary it a little better . .. he (Trump) but ) I do n’t think it ’s as big of a he (Trump) as people are making it out to be . Like he (Trump) of the rest of the politics that ’s going on , man , it always gets blown out of he (Trump) . " It brings up questions of why he (Trump) why did he fire him , you know Hillary Then Hillary ’s going to replace him ? You know what I Hillary ? Who ’s going to be replacing Comey ? Because we do need a good strong FBI . Our country takes a lot to work , you know . " I was hoping Trump would ’ve done a lot better with his presidency so far . . Trump Truthfully , I do n’t think he ’s really made much progress Trump but I do n’t think he ’s going to be able Trump do as much as he wanted to do . " Trump , I ’m glad I voted for him . A lot of Hillary Trump policies I just could n’t support . Clearly , we ’re diehard conservative here , so you know and I know where she stands against guns and a Hillary of the right wing .

He thinks the President tried to Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland it work .   " He should have fired Comey a Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland time ago . Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland think he should have fired Comey when Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland got into office Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland " Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland said . " He extended an olive branch to Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland . "   Scott dismisses Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland claim that the Scott will affect the Russian investigation .   " Comey himself was n’t doing the Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland Comey had field agents investigating and then Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland their findings over to him . So , it ’s not Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland Comey ’s firing stops the investigation because Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland n’t . " the Russian investigation Roche , the Russian investigation manager   Roche , 25 , of Greeley , Colorado , says he did n’t vote for Trump so much as Dane Roche, project manager  Roche, 25, of Greeley, Colorado voted against Clinton .

She also thinks far too much is being made of the Trump investigation . " He ’s done nothing but dig and work hard since he Trump been in office . If there ’s a weakness Trump he detects it , then they ’re gone . He ’s Trump going to surround himself with people who do Trump job . " " I Trump the timing ( with they Russian investigation ) is a coincidence . He was probably the Russia investigation was n’t an effective leader Trump he was out . " John Corry , real estate broker Trump Corry , of Chicago , said he might have been surprised by Comey ’s firing a couple Trump years ago , but not now . Comey " Nothing surprises me anymore , particularly after what just happened in the election . . .. There is no normal or status quo anymore , as much as the Democrats and Republicans try and cram it down our throats . "     " The situation with Comey is interesting because if you go back seven months the Democrats wanted Comey lynch him .   He had all these fireable offenses . . .. " Comey I think Comey got a raw deal ? Probably , but that ’s the nature Comey politics . "   The situation has n’t affected his opinion of Trump , although he does wonder why liberals do n’t Comey that their aversion to Trump Comey not so different from conservatives’ feelings toward Barack liberals during his Trump . " What ’s frustrating to me is that the left Comey does n’t get it , six months later . This is n’t about Trump . It the left Trump the vote . . .. If you look at what This with Obama , there was just as much pushback ( to his actions ) Barack Obama the hypocrisy is right before everyone ’s eyes . Barack Obama   Ingrid Mueller , spokeswoman for    group , Mueller of Beverly Hills , California California is one of Trump ’s Latina supporters Trump spokeswoman for " Make Trump . " " I think that James Comey should have been fired because he protected Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland year with the email scandal .

Hillary Clinton Darrell Scott, pastor, Scott, from Cleveland he the email scandal overdue .
