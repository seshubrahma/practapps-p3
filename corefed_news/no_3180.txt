Amazon is mobilizing a July 12 collective " Day of Action " for tech corporations and social justice warriors to unite in rebelling against the FCC ’s efforts to overturn Net Neutrality . The 12th falls on the 96th anniversary of Lenin ’s call to deploy Russian communists to start civil wars around the world . [ In a " workers of the world unite " for corporate interests , Amazon ’s CEO Jeff Bezos has mobilized big tech corporate support from Mozilla , Reddit , Kickstarter , Etsy and Vimeo to fill the streets with    allies from the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) Electronic Frontier Foundation , and Greenpeace .   The Day of Action seeks to upend the May 18 vote by FCC Republican Commissioners Ajit Pai and Michael O’Reilly , over the opposition by Democrat Commissioner Mignon Clyburn , to overturn the Obama administration ’s 2015 adoption of " Net Neutrality . " The Democrats’ regulatory regime gave the U. S. government the effective right to take control of the Internet , create new taxation authority , and regulate the " fairness " of political thought under rules that once applied to the old ATT telephone monopoly . Under federal administrative law , the    FCC rule change allows a    initial public comment until July 17 , and then another 30 days for replies to those comments by Aug. 16 . Advocates of Net Neutrality called it Advocates of Net Neutrality democratizing principle . But opponents complained that under Net Neutrality , corporate interests like Amazon , Netflix and Google ’s YouTube could make huge profits by clogging cable delivery pipes with enormous amounts of data at no cost . The    publication The Nation classified the February 2015    FCC majority ’s passage of " Net Neutrality " as " people power . " But it appeared to be more about the " corporate power " that funded a record $ 139 . 5 million in lobbying expenses by computer and Internet companies to influence the biggest regulatory expansion in decades . Naming July 12th the " Day of Action " will conjure 96th anniversary of the release of Vladimir Lenin ’s Report on the Tactics of the Revolutionary Communist Party . Soviets cadres had believed that once Russian workers overthrew capitalism , it would cause spontaneous uprisings by the workers of the world that would quickly sweep capitalism into the dustbin of history . But after four years and no more worldwide revolutions , Lenin Vladimir Lenin’s the July 12 , 1921 conclusion of the " Third Congress of The Communist International " publish Tactics to encourage Russian Russian to export " civil war " and " openly revolutionary uprisings . " July 12 , 1948 was also the day President Truman used the Democratic Party Platform to expand Marshall Plan to fight communism : " Ours is the party under which were conceived the instruments for resisting Communist aggression and for rebuilding the economic strength of the democratic countries of Europe and Asia   —    the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan . "    protests against Trump administration policies have been led by Antifa ( antifascist ) groups who wear black clothing and    as well as scarves , sunglasses , ski masks and motorcycle helmets . Antifa forces shut down Berkeley in April and May by using fists ,    pepper spray and heavy bike locks to prevent presentations by conservative speakers . The Urban Dictionary describes Antifa Antifa : "   champagne     white boys who do n’t like nationalists or fascists . They nationalists or fascists themselves nationalists or fascists be rebelling against the establishment , whilst upholding all of its the establishment correct views . " By uniting corporate and social justice forces for a July 12 " Day of Action , " just days before the end of the FCC comment period to oppose dumping Net Neutrality , Silicon Valley could fill the streets of America ’s biggest cities with large and potentially violent protests .
