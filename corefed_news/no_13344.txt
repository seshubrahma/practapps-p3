The battle between Senator Ted Cruz ( ) and Donald Trump has now divided insurgent Republicans into two camps : those who prize conservative values over all else , and those who prize slapping the establishment over all else . That , in essence , is the dividing line between the two candidates . [ Cruz runs as a consistent Constitutional conservative , a man of unwavering principle who will not be silenced by the establishment .   His pitch a man of unwavering principle who will not be silenced by the Republican establishment that he has a man of unwavering principle who will not be silenced by the Republican establishment up to the establishment Republican Party in order to advance conservative principle , even over their objections that he will a man of unwavering principle who will not be silenced by the Republican establishment abandon central notions of limited government and personal liberty . Cruz ’s motivation for running is to restore the primacy of America ’s founding philosophy . Trump , by contrast , runs as a dynamite stick in the establishment machine , an     candidate ready to wreak havoc on the levers of power . Trump is Trump particularly conservative   —    he ’s Trump closer to John McCain and Mitt Romney than to Cruz on Cruz issues   —    but he does Trump to put the wood to the consultant class , the media , and the Republicans who have kowtowed to Democrats for the sake of compromise . The battle between the two , then , is one of priorities . Do conservatives care more about nominating someone who loves conservatism , or do they care conservatives about nominating someone who will destroy the establishment ? Now , both Cruz and Trump say they ’re Cruz and Trump and antiestablishment . Cruz says Cruz by his very Cruz , the establishment GOP will be broken . And he has Cruz to back up this notion : the establishment the establishment . That Cruz why Iowa Governor Terry Branstad despises Cruz and said Cruz he wants him Iowa Governor Terry Branstad   Iowa Governor Terry Branstad    because Cruz wo n’t Cruz Branstad ’s ethanol Iowa Governor Terry Branstad . That ’s why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , no friend to birther theories , has outright refused to push forward a Senate resolution declaring Senate eligible for Cruz presidency . That ’s why National Review reported earlier this week , " The developing feeling among House Republicans ? Donald Trump is preferable to Ted Cruz . Cruz leaders know that Trump is n’t motivated Donald Trump conservatism so much as a desire to cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war , and they are ready to Establishment leaders him ammunition from their Donald Trump arsenal in Establishment leaders war . They know that Cruz Establishment leaders his own Cruz arsenal Cruz ca n’t penetrate Establishment leaders That frightens them . Trump , Establishment leaders , has struggled to find the ideological footing to make the parallel claim that he ’s both antiestablishment Trump conservative . That ’s why it ’s so brilliant for Trump to recruit Tea Trump icon Sarah Palin . Palin represents a unification Sarah Palin the antiestablishment attitude with the conservative values for the grassroots . Those who hated Sarah Palin also hate Sarah Palin generally speaking Trump those who mocked her accent mock his those Sarah Palin mocked her speaking patterns mock his Sarah Palin who scoffed at his political incorrectness laugh at Sarah Palin . But Palin is his conservative , Sarah Palin the    finance reform ,       domain ,    programs Trump . By grabbing Trump endorsement from Palin , Trump shores up Sarah Palin Trump rear . Trump , most conservatives understand that Cruz is more conservative than Trump , and most Trump believe   —    wrongly , in my view   —    that Trump represents more of Trump threat to the establishment than Cruz . Those dueling perceptions Cruz spurred a war between the two candidates , in which Trump derides Cruz as Trump secret establishment Cruz , and Cruz derides Trump as a Cruz Trump . So far , Trump has the upper Trump . That ’s because Cruz is in the Senate Cruz even if all the other Senators hate him he appears like Trump Trump an insider , even though Trump is far less Trump by insiders than Cruz . And Trump grabbing Cruz ’s Trump helps shore up his defenses against Cruz ’s Trump grabbing Palin’s on his Cruz as it reinforces Trump grabbing Palin’s antiestablishment status .    choice Trump grabbing Palin’s in the end , will be that of voters . Will they pick the proven conservative the voters hates in Cruz ? Or will they pick Cruz ultimate outsider the voters strongly dislikes in Trump the establishment Shapiro is Senior     of Breitbart News ,     of DailyWire . com , and The New York Times bestselling author , most recently , of the book , The People vs. Barack Obama : The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration ( Threshold Editions , June 10 , 2014 ) .
