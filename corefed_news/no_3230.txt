Sunday on CNN ’s " State of the Union , " House Intelligence Committee ranking Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) said it is " way premature " to conclude that members of President Donald Trump ’s campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election .   " I do n’t think we can say anything definitively at this point , " Schiff said . " we are still at the very early stages of the investigation . The only thing I can say is that it would be irresponsible for we not to get to the bottom of this . we really need to find out exactly what the Russians did . Because one of the most important conclusions that the intelligence community reached is that the intelligence community are going to do this again to the United States . the intelligence community are doing this already in Europe . So we can say conclusively this is something that needs to be thoroughly investigated but this ’s way premature to be reaching conclusions . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
