Friday repeated language from tweet to tweet does lend itself to use by those who oppose the The repeated language from tweet to tweet order : " The US turned me away at the border . "    " I think it ’s impossible to ignore the current political reality , " said Neiss . " But I ’m not the one that planned on signing the executive order today . " The museum the executive order efforts , could not be reached Friday for comment .    Neiss , a Jewish educator living in St. Louis , hopes the Twitter bot provides education .
