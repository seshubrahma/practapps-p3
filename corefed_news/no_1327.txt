WASHINGTON   —    At a luxurious hilltop estate with sweeping vistas of the Hudson River , an adviser to President Obama began meeting on Wednesday with aides to the candidates vying to replace him to make the first , early preparations for the day when President Obama leaves office . During a    gathering on the grounds of Kykuit , the manor built by John D. Rockefeller , they the manor built by John D. Rockefeller attend breakout sessions , working lunches and dinners , and     discussions on how to execute a seamless transfer of power in an age when the threat of a terrorist attack like the one on Sept. 11 , 2001 , requires a fully functioning White House at all times . That need was brought home forcefully to President George W. Bush after    and his President George W. Bush that his President George W. Bush lose no time in taking the reins of power led to what is regarded as a model transition when it was time for him President George W. Bush leave office . Now , in an acknowledgment that its time is running out , the Obama White House has begun planning for the next transition , a task akin to a giant corporate merger , but one that involves the federal government ’s 4 , 000 senior executives and a $ 4 trillion budget . And it will all be compressed into the 72 days between the election on Nov. 8 and the Jan. 20 , 2017 , inauguration . " It is the most complex , most difficult takeover on the planet today , and probably in history , " said Max Mr. Stier Mr. Stier declined to discuss the details of the meeting , including its participants , saying it was designed to provide a " safe space " for frank and confidential discussions about the transition process . But he said it was vital that the preparations begin now , removed Mr. Stier the chaos and Mr. Stier of the presidential campaign and the pressures of a White House bent on pressing Mr. Obama ’s agenda while there Mr. Stier still Mr. Stier . " Campaigns were always loath to do early or aggressive    planning for fear that they will be accused of measuring the drapes or being presumptuous , so they ended up doing it at the last minute , " said Mr. Stier . " And the White House does n’t want to Campaigns viewed as lame duck , but they also , as stewards of Campaigns government , really need to ensure that the handoff is as thorough and clean as possible . " Mr. Obama began pressing his senior advisers to begin planning for the the White House late last fall , telling them he wanted to take the process seriously and match or exceed the job done by Mr. Bush , to whom he and Mr. Obama team give high marks for a    handover in January 2009 . " his senior advisers Mr. Obama that he wanted this to be a serious process , " Anita Decker Breckenridge , Mr. Obama ’s deputy Mr. Obama of Mr. Obama for operations and the point person on the process , said in an Mr. Obama . Ms. Mr. Obama Breckenridge was herself the beneficiary of memorandums , Ms. Decker Breckenridge on Mr. Obama ’s first day in office as the chief of staff at the National Endowment for the Arts . The president " wants to do the same , Ms. Decker Breckenridge not better , for the next administration , " Ms. Decker Breckenridge said he told her . " This Ms. Decker Breckenridge just , at Ms. Decker Breckenridge core , good democracy , good government , and it ’s critical . " Denis McDonough , Mr. Obama ’s chief of staff , convened a meeting of the cabinet last month to begin thinking through plans for the transition , and Ms. Decker Breckenridge has begun meeting The president with Ms. Decker Breckenridge Mayock , a senior adviser at the This of Management and Budget , to compare notes and This through task lists . Mr. Mayock will attend this week ’s meetings in New York . It was fear that drove Mr. Bush to plan early and carefully for an effective transition Ms. Decker Breckenridge disrupted his presidency less than eight months Mr. Mayock the transition plan . " We talked about    and , ‘ Thank goodness it was Sept. 11 and not Feb. 11 because we would have been completely incapable of dealing with it then,’ " said Clay Johnson III , a top Office of Management and Budget official in Mr. Bush ’s White House Mr. Bush was a central player in his Mr. Bush transition into office and his 2008 handover to Mr. Obama . " There are just so many more things that a new We has to be prepared for and say grace over now , We ’s just the nature of our world . " In its 2004 report , the independent    commission noted that Mr. Bush did not have his full complement of senior officials in place until six months Mr. Bush’s he took office , creating Mr. Bush’s dangerous situation that could be exploited in the future . Mr. Bush took the issue to heart , telling his top advisers as early as 2007 that they were to begin planning for the handover . " He told me this is the first transition in modern American history when the homeland has been under Mr. Bush , and we need to make sure that it ’s as Mr. Bush as it can possibly be , " said Joshua B. Bolten , his chief of Mr. Bush the time . Mr. Bolten , who had Mr. Bush a    aide to the elder President his top advisers Bush , recalled how his transition out of office Mr. Bush 1993   —    like those of his predecessors   —    had been relatively " thin " and poorly planned . " It ’s different the homeland because we ’re vulnerable the homeland and we are essentially under attack here at home from Mr. Bush elements , " Mr. Bolten said the Joshua B. Bolten, his chief of staff at the time switch over that terrorists may want to try to take advantage of . " Mr. Bush ’s the elder President George Bush handed Mr. Obama ’s aides detailed memorandums on policy issues and agency the elder President George Bush plans after the election . They also collaborated on a tabletop exercise one week before Mr. Obama ’s inauguration in which they postulated several simultaneous we attacks on American cities , and sat side by side in the Situation Room gaming the elder President George Bush would respond . Since then , Congress has enacted legislation to codify some elements of the    transition process . Mr. Obama signed the most recent revisions into law the elder President George Bush month , and they are guiding Ms. Decker Breckenridge ’s lengthy    list . The measure sets an early May deadline aides —    six months before Election Day   — Mr. Obama the president to create a aides coordinating council at the White House and a transition directors council for federal agencies , each of which must appoint a senior career employee to manage the handoff . Well before those dates , the National Archives and Records Administration   —    Mr. Obama law must take custody of all the departing president ’s records by 12:01 p. aides on Jan. 20   —    has to begin copying a vast amount of digital material to its servers . The job has grown exponentially larger in recent years as the White House has become increasingly wired and data driven . ( When Mr. Obama took office , there were fewer than a dozen laptops in use at the White House now , nearly every employee has one . ) While the Clinton administration produced roughly three terabytes   —    or trillions of bytes   —    of records , including 20 million emails , the Bush administration eight years later had to transfer about 80 terabytes , including 200 million the National Archives and Records Administration  —   which by law must take custody of all the departing president’s records by 12:01 p. m. on Jan. 20  —    . The archives administration projects that this president will turn over two and a half times as much : 200 terabytes . Recognizing the magnitude of the job , the White House resolved to begin the process , which involves the White House files of email records , photographs and videos that have become a staple of White House communications during Mr. Obama ’s term , several months earlier than in the past . It is expected to commence this month . A smooth transition has not always been a priority , and there are cautionary tales . In 2002 , the General Accounting Office reported that " damage , theft , vandalism and pranks " had occurred at the White House during the transition from Bill Clinton to Mr. Bush , including several instances of computer keyboards missing their " W ’s . " But presidents and candidates have a powerful interest in the White House transition . " You want to protect the presidency as an institution , and you also want to use transition as part of your legacy   —    you want to go out well , " said Martha Joynt Kumar , whose 2015 book , " Before the Oath , " dissects the 2008 transition . " For the White House the impetus comes from wanting to be able Clinton on Day Bush The beginning of an administration his presidency you have the greatest computer keyboards to bring about change but the least capacity to figure out how to do it . " It is not yet clear , however , how much the presidential campaigns are prioritizing the transition . Hillary Clinton , who has not yet selected anyone to lead transition planning , sent a midlevel policy staffer to this week ’s meetings . Bernie Sanders tapped Michaeleen Crowell , his Senate chief of staff , among others , to participate . Gov. John Kasich of Ohio dispatched Kerry Knott , who served as chief of staff to Dick Armey , a former House the Obama White House leader , to attend and serve as the point person for transition preparations . Michael Glassner , Donald J. Trump ’s national political director , was also this week’s meetings in New York Senator Ted Cruz ’s campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment . Ted Kaufman , a former senator of Delaware , who introduced legislation enacted in 2010 governing presidential transitions and who helped design the 2016 law , Bernie Sanders savvy candidates would take the issue seriously . " It was clear to me that you could n’t wait until Election Day and leave yourself with basically two months to do this   —    you had to plan way in advance , " he said . " Anybody who is running knows that your first term is when you ’re going to get done 90 percent of what you ’re going to get done   —    second terms are to be survived the issue    and the first 100 days is when you are going to accomplish most of it . So you have to be ready . "
