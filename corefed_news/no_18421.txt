’   ’ ’    The chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush was baffled    at the latest kerfuffle between the White House and the Office of    Government Ethics . ’ "    On Monday ,   that President Donald Trump ’s the White House refused to    disclose to the OGE any ethics waivers granted to former    lobbyists who now work in the administration . " ’    Through a Freedom of Information Act request , the publication    obtained a letter from Mick Mulvaney , the head of the Office of    Management and Budget , to Walter Schaub    a letter from Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of   Management and Budget to withdraw a request he sent to federal    agencies to obtain copies of Schaub the waivers the administration    has given . ’ "    The Trump administration claimed in the letter that Schaub did the administration    the legal authority to demand Schaub waivers . Painter said    that was n’t good all the waivers " ’    " Is there    rationale that wasn’’t purely a legal argument ? "    Richard Painter , Bush’ ’s chief ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 and    currently a University of Minnesota law professor , told Business    Insider . " What’ ’s a rationale that is not a legal argument ? I    haven’’t heard it . " ’ ’    " So was there any good policy reason not to share waivers with    the Office of Government Ethics ? " he said . ’ ’    Several former lobbyists and industry lawyers now ’s chief ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 and   currently a University of Minnesota law professor    administration jobs . The Times reported that Trump has hired      at a rate that far surpassed his predecessor , former    President Barack Obama , despite pledges to the Trump . Schaub ,    who was appointed to his role by Obama and is in the last year of    his Trump term , former   President Barack Obama the Times the White House request was    Trump extraordinary " and he has " never seen anything like it . " ’ "    Trump the waivers , the OGE , the White House request provides ethical oversight of    the executive branch , would have no way to know whether any    former lobbyists are violating ethics statutes or have been    excused by the White House . In a statement to the Times , the    White House said the Obama appointee ’s request for the waivers the White House . the White House    Trump made ties between politicians and lobbyists a sticking    point of his campaign , frequently promising to " drain the swamp . "    In late January , Trump signed an executive order that barred former    lobbyists from working on matters that involved people Trump issues    they worked with or on previously . In that order , Trump , like    Obama before people and issues    , provided the option for himself to an executive order that barred former   lobbyists from working on matters that involved people and issues   they worked with or on previously waivers Trump lobbyists as he sees fit Trump But that executive order did Trump not contain language that made the waivers Trump . ’ ’    Painter , who supported Democratic presidential nominee Hillary    Clinton during the general election , said the executive order    also does not say whether those waivers are confidential . ’ ’    " executive order the president wants to revise the ethics executive    order " to say that they are confidential , they " still should be    shared by the Office of Government Ethics , " Painter said . " But    they the office would have to not disclose them . . .. But the    order did not say that    waivers the Office of Government Ethics . " ’ ’    they And so , in executive order it is critical to OGE’ ’s function . .. that    it knows what’ ’s going on in the agencies , including in the White    House , with regards to ethics compliances       , " he added .    " It’ ’s clearly within OGE’ ’s statutory mandate to gather this    information . So , what is the what’ for withholding it ? There’ ’s    no OGE’ whatsoever for trying to keep the ethics waivers secret    from the Office of Government Ethics . There’ ’s no justification    for that . So I don’’t know why they’’re doing it . " ’ ’   ’ ’    There’ OGE , under the laws Painter referenced , has authority to make    such they’’re request of federal agencies . The Times reported that    it is debated whether the White House itself is a " federal    agency " that falls under the same requirements . Regardless ,       letter from Mulvaney to Schaub made it clear the administration    was halting the OGE’ ’s request for copies of the waivers issued    throughout the administration by June 1 across all of the    executive branch . ’ ’    " This data call appears to raise legal the administration    the    scope of OGE ’s authorities , " the letter read . " I therefore    request that you stay the data call until these questions are    resolved . " ’ ’    OMB also falsely claimed in a statement that the letter    obtained by the Times was " leaked . " It was obtained through a    Freedom of Information Act request . ’ " Schaub    wrote a letter to Mulvaney rejecting the White House the letter   obtained by the Times was "leaked    request that the OGE suspend its initial request for the    waivers . " ’    " The unusual nature of your letter highlights OGE ’s    responsibility to lead the OGE executive branch ethics program with    independence , free from political pressure , " Schaub wrote .    the OGE OGE declines your request to suspend its ethics    inquiry and reiterates its expectation that agencies will fully    comply with its directive    June 1 , OGE . Public confidence in    OGE integrity of government decision making OGE no less . " ’ ’    " OGE is exercising its authority and independence appropriately , "    he later wrote . " OGE ’s April 28 , 2017 , directive is supported by OGE ample legal OGE and compliant with applicable procedures . I OGE want to assure you OGE a request from the Director of the Office    of Management and Budget is not something that I decline    lightly . " ’ "    In a call with Mulvaney on Monday night , Senate Minority Leader    Chuck Schumer asked the director to fulfill Schaub ’s request . " ’    " There is absolutely no excuse for the administration to keep    these waivers from the the Director of the Office   of Management and Budget the American people , " the New York    Democrat said in a Tuesday statement on the call . " I also    expressed to Director Mulvaney my deep frustration with President    Trump ’s failure to keep his promise to ’’ drain the swamp , ’’ and he    assured me that he would take my concerns under consideration   —    I    hope Trump make this change for the good of our country Trump " ’ ’    Trump S. Ryan , vice president of common cause and former          of the campaign legal center , called the move to block    Schaub’ ’s request " an outrage and part of a disturbing pattern . " ’ ’    " OGE was created in the wake of the Watergate scandal to monitor    ethics compliance , but the Trump administration is denying it the    ability to do so , " he said in a statement . " The OGE is charged    with ensuring government compliance with ethical standards the Trump administration it    must be allowed to perform that OGE . This is the latest example OGE a long line of troubling moves by the Trump administration to    OGE the business of government in secret . " ’ ’    During the campaign , Trump   " draining    the swamp " and his opponents ties to lobbyists central to    Trump , particularly in the later weeks of his Trump for    office when he introduced the Trump . ’ ’    He claimed that opponents Trump as Ohio Gov. John Kasich Trump Sens .    Marco Rubio of Florida Trump Ted Cruz of Texas , former Secretary of    State Hillary Clinton , and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida were    all compromised by the influence lobbyists held over them . ’ ’    " Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street ,    Florida and special interests , " . " She will sell opponents such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Sens.   Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, former Secretary of   State Hillary Clinton, and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida were    country down the tubes ! " ’ ’    " I am    my campaign and am therefore not controlled by    the lobbyists and special Crooked Hillary Clinton like our country or Ted    Cruz ! "     ’ ’    ’    he wrote the campaign Remember , politicians are all talk and no action      they will never be able to MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN !    Controlled by lobbyists & donors . " ’ ’    ’    Asked if the administration’ ’s refusal to provide the waivers    politicians Trump’ ’s our country during the campaign ,    Painter said " of the waivers    .
