Thursday in Japan at the    meeting , President Barack Obama said world leaders are " rattled " by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump because Obama said Trump seems more interested " in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe . "   When asked about world leaders reaction to Trump , Obama said , " world leaders are paying very close attention to this election . I think this election ’s fair to say world leaders are surprised by the Republican nominee world leaders are not sure how seriously to take some of the Republican nominee pronouncements . But world leaders are rattled by it   —    and for good reason . Because a lot of the proposals he has made display either ignorance of world affairs , or a cavalier attitude , or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous .
