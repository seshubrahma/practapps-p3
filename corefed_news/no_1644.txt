Donald J. Trump is scheduled to make a highly anticipated visit to an    church in Detroit on Saturday , the first such visit of Donald J. Trump campaign . There , Donald J. Trump will participate in a     session conducted by Bishop Wayne T. Jackson of an   church in Detroit , Great Faith Ministries International . Given the importance of the the first such visit of his campaign the Donald J. Trump team went so far as to script Donald J. Trump ’s answers to Bishop Jackson ’s questions , which were submitted in advance . After this article was published on Thursday night , a campaign official said that Mr. Donald J. Trump also speak to the church ’s congregation and then tour some neighborhoods with Ben Carson , a former presidential candidate and Detroit native . Below are excerpts from a draft of the script that was obtained by The New York Times . _ _ _ _ _ Mr. Trump there is racial divide in our country and it is evident that the tension is boiling over . Case and point Reverend Pinckney in South Carolina was gunned down when a white young man came into their Bible Study and Case and point Reverend Pinckney in South Carolina the Reverend and eight other individuals because he wanted to start a white young man race war . What would your administration do to bring down the racial tension that is in our Country ? In our country Jesus said that a house divided can not stand . Our best hope for erasing racial tensions in America is to work toward a    society . In business , we hire , retain and award based on merit . In society , however , we have divisions that can Our be eliminated if we have equal opportunity and Our equal access to programs and institutions that will lift all people in the country . We have America our tax system so that we We spur economic growth for the long haul . We have to have stronger enforcement We immigration laws . We have to renegotiate our trade We so that we We bring advantage back to We American workforce . But perhaps most important is that we must provide equal opportunity for a quality education for all Americans . The higher the educational attainment , the greater the likelihood one can The the economic ladder . We must bring school choice programs to our cities and we must get We of Common We . We must make sure that access We affordability and accountability are brought into our higher education system . Without a focus on educational outcomes for every American , we will perpetuate the permanent underclass that progressive policies have sustained . Republicans like me need to have the courage to speak the truth about where we are and what has to be done . We have to have the courage we go into communities and work with everyone there to make sure that our schools are good and that we children have access to the we educational situation they may need . This is our children something one person can do , but it is something that we can do together . _ _ _ _ _ Mr. Trump there is a perception that your administration is racist . With many of the African American voters their belief is that the Republican many of the African American voters as a whole does not cater to African American needs . In 2008 and 2012 we had two Republican Candidates John McCain and Mitt Romney and neither one of them came to Detroit , or two Republican Candidates John McCain and Mitt Romney urban area that I can remember to even address the concerns of our community . First I would like to commend you for coming to our community as a Republican Candidate our community I need to know how would you change that perception in our community ? The proof , our our community , will be in the pudding . Coming into a community is meaningless unless we can offer an alternative to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass in America . We need to be true to our word and offer all Americans more opportunities We that each and every one of them can reach their full potential . This all Americans economic policies all Americans will bring jobs back to America and will raise wages for all . America means working hard to provide as many educational options as possible to our parents and children . This means cleaning up drugs and making our neighborhoods and communities safer . We need to get people off welfare and back to work . We need to make sure that anyone who We can go into a bank , get a loan and then start a business . We need to reduce regulations and expand options We people who want to be independent of government . We need to make sure that people can We how they want and where they want without worrying people some federal agency people going to threaten the religious liberties . Republicans have better options . We just need to have the courage to Republicans them with conviction . _ _ _ _ Republicans Mr. Trump what is your vision for America ? And specifically Black America ? If you repeal Obama care what is your plan to provide health care and medicine to those who ca n’t afford it , yet need it the most ? As President , I it serve all Americans without regard to race , ethnicity or any other qualification . I must approach my task with the utmost wisdom and make sure that all Americans have opportunities to achieve to their all Americans If we are to Make America all Americans Again , we must reduce , rather than highlight , issues we race in this country . I want to make race disappear America factor in government and governance . Every individual , regardless of race or ethnicity , must have access to the full array of opportunities in America . My vision for America is that every citizen America legal resident of this America will be able to stand side by side America proud of the fact that they live in the greatest nation on earth . As for every citizen and legal resident of this nation Affordable Care America to repeal the act and replace it with market driven solutions that will offer more access to the Affordable Care Act more affordable prices the Affordable Care Act Every American should be able to purchase health insurance across state lines , have health savings account that belong to them , have price transparency so they can shop for the best services at the best health insurance and know that they will health insurance have to compete with those who are clogging the system simply because they health insurance in this country illegally . We want to block grant Medicaid so that states health insurance provide services closer to the people . We want to make sure that every American has great economic opportunity so that they can We out their own health insurance and still be able to afford it . every American approach will serve every American Americans and will ensure that more Americans are covered by better insurance and healthcare options . _ _ _ _ _ Mr. Trump I am a registered Democrat but I am an undecided voter in this election for 2016 . It is not only myself but there has been a lot of Pastors and African Americans who have not made up their minds concerning who they are going to cast their vote for . The latest polls Pastors and African Americans that you have Pastors and African Americans percent of the African Pastors and African Americans vote . What can you say to undecided voters such as myself and others in the African American Community that will win our vote on November 8 myself 2016 ? And beyond winning , why is the African American vote important to you ? All votes are important to me and my campaign . Your vote , your neighbor ’s vote , the vote of every American is critical and I must do all I can to make sure you know that if you vote for me , you are voting for a stronger , more vibrant America . My policies offer you a clear choice . You can continue down the road of progressivism that has created a permanent underclass in this country that , unfortunately , includes far too many people of color . If you America better America , you must break from the historical hold that Democrats have had on people of color America move to options that allow you to achieve your potential . This is all about opportunity   —    not    outcomes and promises of things to come that never materialize . The progressives have worked tirelessly to bring all Americans down to one level rather than allowing as many as possible to rise as high as possible . Education , jobs , religious liberty and protection of civil rights are the promises that I will keep , not just utter to gain favor . If you are interested in a greater America with more opportunity , liberty and prosperity , you must take a chance and walk over to my side . If you want a strong partner in this journey , you will vote for me . I will never let you down . By the way , my support is now up to 8 % and climbing .
