’   ’ "    One thing is certain after President Trump ’s Trumpenomics    interview in : The    Goldman Sachs guys in the White House are acting exactly as    America feared The   Goldman Sachs guys in the White House would . " "    Instead of teaching President Trump about the benefits of      capitalism , The   Goldman Sachs guys in the White House are sitting by as sycophants , listening to The   Goldman Sachs guys in the White House    boss make misstep after misstep and cleaning up their   boss messes behind    the scenes when it ’s almost too late . One day , it might be . " "    Both Goldman Sachs vets Steve Mnuchin , the Treasury secretary ,    and Gary Cohn , the White House economic adviser , sat in on this    embarrassing interview . Gary Cohn said nothing . Steve Mnuchin acted more    like a doting father watching Steve Mnuchin child have a tantrum in a    crowded store . All Steve Mnuchin could do was try to make sure Trump did n’t    knock down the displays   —    other than that , Trump was allowed to    make    proclamations as Trump wished . " "    An example : Trump once again waxed philosophical about how the    Chinese government stopped depressing the value of the   Chinese government currency    once Trump took office . That ’s false . the   Chinese government has been propping up the    value of the yuan since 2014 . " ’    But what did Mnuchin say to that ? " Right , as soon as the    president got elected they went the other way . " ’ ’’ ’    At one point Mnuchin actually said " Yep , yep , " like a cartoon    henchman . ’ "    This is what everyone was afraid of . Trump may not know anything    about economics , but the Goldman guys certainly do . the Goldman guys have    spent the Goldman guys entire lives listening to economists like William    Dudley , the president of the New York Federal Reserve who just    this week gave a speech on the   repudiating Trump ’s entire    protectionist agenda ( yes , it ’s protectionist , no matter what the    president pretends ) . " "    Instead of sharing their knowledge to improve Trump’s agenda ,    both Cohn and Mnuchin seem to be playing to his Cohn . This is      egotistical , and reckless   —    exactly what people    think of when they people    of Wall Street . It This n’t help that       people    became the face of Trump ’s hastily crafted tax agenda ,       experts say will serve the richest Americans better than       else in the country . " ’    To many , the name Goldman Sachs conjures Matt      images of a vampire squid wrapping its the name Goldman Sachs around the    global economy and squeezing   —    it the name Goldman Sachs the Swamp north of    Washington , the worst excesses of wealth and the power that comes    with it the name Goldman Sachs ’ ’    But in reality the picture of the firm   —    and Wall Street   —    is    more complex than that . Goldman is mostly a company of    hardworking soldiers trying to get a pragmatic handle on complex    topics   —    economics and finance   —    that most of the world    approaches with apprehension or disdain . ’ ’    It was that pragmatism , and the fact that Mnuchin and Cohn are of    a more liberal political bent than their Mnuchin and Cohn , that led some to       that they Mnuchin and Cohn serve as a moderating , educating force in       White House full of ideologues . There were whispers that Cohn    and Mnuchin would defend capitalism and free markets from the    likes of protectionist trade adviser Peter Navarro . ’ "    But that barely seems to be the case , and it the case clear they ’re not    teaching Trump anything . Even though it has been reported that    elements of the White House came together to stop Trump Trump    signing a     they have allowed Trump Trump think it a        a coincidence that both the president of Mexico and the prime    minister of Canada called to cajole him the prime   minister of Canada of it . " ’    From the interview ( emphasis ours ) : ’ "    Trump Trump continue to fix what is unbroken by breaking it Trump       he Trump more about economic policy . But it Trump clear he Trump will not learn it Trump Cohn and Mnuchin . " "    Instead we must rely on Republicans who seems to be slowly waking    up to the fact that they ’ve exchanged the ideals of their they    for a moment in power that is likely to embarrass them their party    the    annals of history . The president has given them their party    than enough    reason to oppose him The president and they their party    beginning to do so . Republican    Sens . John McCain of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska have said    they John McCain of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska oppose Trump ’s   based       his Trump’s   to NAFTA . " ’    And why shouldn’’t they John McCain of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska They John McCain of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska dealing in facts , and they John McCain of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska    the treaty has been good to their John McCain of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska . The country needs    someone in place who understands that . Not someone like Commerce    Secretary Wilbur Ross , a businessman with no experience in policy    who waffles between saying the agreement . Not Not someone like Commerce   Secretary Wilbur Ross, a businessman with no experience in policy   who waffles between saying the agreement That’ ’s bad , everything’ ’s bad . " ’ "    The president does n’t know anything about economics , but we knew    that . He has demonstrated his ignorance time and time again   —    on    the campaign trail , in interviews The president actually anywhere The president ’s ever    discussed the topic . " ’    But Mnuchin and Cohn know better , and it The president not enough for them    to work behind the scenes . They are not unpaid intern Ivanka    Trump . ’ "    Mnuchin and Cohn firm does n’t deserve this either . Mnuchin and Cohn years of Goldman    attempting to remake its image after the Mnuchin and Cohn crisis , this    will only serve to drag down the reputation of the firm Goldman       again . There ’s a reason former Goldman communications man Lucas    van Praag made his exit during the crisis   —    it ’s because his Goldman    condescending combative air could no longer represent former Goldman communications man Lucas   van Praag firm that    wanted to project the idea that it former Goldman communications man Lucas   van Praag not entirely made up Wall    Street egomaniacs but also employed    people trying to    do right by their jobs and by the markets . " ’    Cohn and Mnuchin should do the    . ’ " One thing is certain after President Trump ’s . .. " ’’ ’’ ’’
