" " Well I do n’t know if I ’m a conservative , " proclaimed MILO , after Bill Maher branded Bill Maher as such . " You write for Breitbart and you ’re a Trump supporter , " Bill Maher replied . " You ’re a conservative . " " Well it ’s interesting the radical gay editorials saying interesting and provocative things about gays are now being published by Breitbart , and I do n’t think really that you can call Trump a traditional conservative , " responded MILO . " MILO ’s not that Republican . " " All I care about is free speech and free expression . I want people to be able to be , do , and say anything , " MILO concluded , before adding , " These days , you ’re right , that ’s a conservative position .
