  ( CNN ) President Barack Obama and his first secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , entered the White House in 2009 with visions of a " Russian reset . " But Obama will leave office next month in the midst of a shadowy Cold    fever dream , as Washington and Moscow are , once again , beset by accusations of diplomatic chicanery and outright espionage . In dropping a new round of targeted sanctions on Russian diplomats and assets in the US , Obama on Thursday struck back at what the intelligence community has portrayed as an unprecedented     and successful     attempt by the Kremlin to meddle in the American democratic process . But even as President Vladimir Putin trolls the White House , saying President Vladimir Putin will turn the other cheek and sit tight awaiting what figures to be a more friendly administration on the horizon , questions outpace answers .   So what comes next and who holds the advantage ? Here ’s what we know , what the players are saying     and how the chess match is unfolding . What did the US do on Thursday and why ? After weeks of    accusations about Russian hacking and promises of retaliation , the White House announced plans to expel 35 Russian diplomats     giving 35 Russian diplomats     and 35 Russian diplomats     families 72 hours to leave the country     and shuttering a pair of Russian compounds in New York and Maryland used by officials , in theory , for recreational purposes .       The new sanctions follow months of insinuations , leaks and , more recently , open accusations that Moscow set out on a coordinated campaign to hack the private communications of American political actors , making public information that would both undermine voters’ confidence in the November elections and , according to some , boost Trump ’s campaign . In a " joint analysis report " by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI , released with the sanctions notice on Thursday a summary titled " Russian Malicious Cyber Activity " and provided a detailed flowchart seeking to illustrate the complex nature of the Russian hacking effort .   How did Putin respond to the sanctions ? The Russian President ’s decision to postpone any retaliation for Washington ’s sanctions , despite Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recommending the     expulsion of US diplomats , surprised some   . In retrospect , Moscow ’s tactics appeared orchestrated : first threatening to match the explosions announced by the Obama administration the previous day , then , in seeking to appear magnanimous     even extending an invitation to the children of American diplomats in Washington to a Christmas party at the Kremlin     backing off .   At the same time , Putin laid the onus of action on incoming President Donald Trump . " It ’s a smart play , " said James Nixie , head of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the      Chatham House . He said Putin while " Russia feels Russia     it has Russia exposed and it has Russia punished , " Putin can Putin to wait a few weeks to hit back . " He ’s Putin about it , Russia acting now , but in fact is just being patient , " Nixie said . Putin ’s Putin will force Trump to show his hand Putin and fast .    " If Trump does Trump play ball , then we ’ll be back to the    adversarial relations , " Nixie said Nixie Putin is Putin to see " is Trump on Trump side , or is he not Putin At this point , we do our know , either . " On Friday afternoon , the    offered some blunt instruction . " Great move on delay ( by V. Putin Putin " he tweeted . Putin I always knew he was very Putin ! " Is this the start of a new Cold War ? While there are echoes of the Cold War in the matching expulsion threats , Nixie argued that Russia ’s actions are predominantly about its future , Russia’s its past : Russia’s " wants a new set of rules " to govern the way the world is run     who wields the power , who controls what , and who listens to whom . Putin ’s move can also be read as an " enormous insult " to the Obama administration , said Jill Dougherty , a Russia analyst and former Moscow bureau chief Moscow CNN . " It ’s an amazing move and it ’s classic It , " Putin said . " He ’s a Putin of doing things that are unexpected , and this is truly unexpected . " How strong is the US case against Russia ? That Russia on whom you ask .    Trump has for months routinely questioned government assertions that    Russian hackers were behind the breaches at the Democratic National Committee and inside Clinton ’s campaign . He has suggested Trump Chinese could be to blame , or even " somebody sitting on their bed that the Chinese 400 pounds . " But the US government has been    on Moscow for months . In October , officials publicly announced they were " officials " Russia had targeted the Democratic Party and aligned organizations . Obama this summer allowed , but stopped short of asserting in an interview that Putin had intended to aid Trump .    How the unflattering communications put on display by the hacks affected the election is nearly impossible to quantify , but the slow drip seemed calculated to sow discord and doubt , especially among Democrats during and after a tense primary contest . Trump now says Trump ’ll meet Trump the intelligence community to hear their case . the intelligence community Why did the White House act now ? The ultimate decision followed a CIA announcement this month , made in private to a group of top US senators , that the hacks were carried out with the express purpose of delivering the White House the White House Their Trump     which , again , has not been made public except through leaks to the press     includes findings that Russian hackers breached , but did not make public information stolen from the accounts of Republicans , including House members and GOP    the White House to a former senior law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the hack investigation told CNN . The Republican National Committee has denied reports that it was compromised or targeted The Republican National Committee and earlier this month , Trump ’s incoming press secretary , Sean Spicer , questioned the intelligence community ’s motives . " If they are so certain it the intelligence community’s motives , why wo n’t they go on the record they are so certain it happened say it ? " Spicer told it . " I do CNN understand it . It does n’t it any it . " What is Obama ’s angle here ? The Russians tend to get the credit     and criticism     for being crafty or acting covertly to advance a range of interests . On its face , the new round of sanctions are a simple act of retaliation     less a deft or devious hand than a symbolic swat     for the Kremlin ’s alleged role in the election season hacks .     But whether it was intended or not , the Obama administration ’s decision to act now , less than a month before clearing out ahead of Trump ’s inaugural , will have a series of    effects that should create difficulties and set a series of political traps for the new administration . Trump the Obama administration’s secret of his Trump’s to establish better relations with Trump’s and his autocratic regime . He Trump’s down Trump’s of the sanctions Trump’s Thursday , saying it was " time for the country to move on to bigger and better things . " A day earlier , the    seemed to throw up his hands entirely , pleading ignorance     the    skepticism     of all things tech . " The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is The whole age of computer on , " he said . " And we have the        we have a lot of other things we but I ’m not sure we have the kind the security we we . "   Trump will we a more comprehensive argument , and understanding , if he is going to successfully navigate a Trump almost uniformly in favor of maintaining or , in the case of hawks like Sens . Lindsey Graham and John McCain , pursuing further avenues of redress . If Obama , his legislative legacy under threat from all Obama , can effectively tie up the new administration and members of its own party     to say nothing of Democrats who will gladly align themselves with more mainstream Republicans     then Democrats stands a better chance of at Obama complicating Trump ’s efforts to undo the work of the past eight years . What is Trump ’s play now ?   Trump Trump who has repeatedly said he just wants everyone to move on Obama can undo the Thursday sanctions with relative ease after he takes office on January 20 . Obama a unilateral decision to reverse course could expose divisions in a GOP caucus that , for all its    talk of unity , remains GOP divided on key issues like spending and what to do after it repeals Obamacare . The confluence of    ’s action and Putin ’s Putin will test Trump right from Trump jump , as moving for steadier relations with Moscow will now Moscow at a heightened domestic cost . the White House Speaker Paul Ryan , a Russia critic , Russia likely seek to influence Trump , further Trump their already fragile relationship and challenging incoming House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Russia critic of staff Reince Priebus , who has emerged as a trusted middleman between his idiosyncratic boss and the established GOP order . While the GOP establishment has stayed critical of Russia GOP Trump Russia it Trump . He is also Trump the GOP establishment his unique handicap Trump an apparent inability to , at least publicly , conceive of the hacking story as anything more or less than a backdoor assault on the legitimacy of his victory on Trump Day .    " If Russia , or Russia other entity , was hacking , why did the White House wait so the White House ? " he asked in Trump tweet last week , before the sanctions had been finalized . " Why did the sanctions complain after Hillary lost ? " The claim was demonstrably false     the grousing had begun well before November 8     but made clear how Trump perceives the Trump . In his Thursday statement Trump the    was more reserved and revealed he would , Trump in the interest of our country and its great people , " take a the country " leaders the country the intelligence community the intelligence community order to be updated on the facts of this situation . "   How Trump responds to Trump facts , and whether he accepts them Trump all , will go a long way in articulating the paths those facts . But until those options are clear , his likeliest route Trump anyone ’s guess .
