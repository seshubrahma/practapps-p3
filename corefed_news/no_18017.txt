’   ’ ’    A presidential candidate , Donald Trump   " I love WikiLeaks ! "    And A presidential candidate, Donald Trump   had good reason to display affection to this website run    by accused rapist Julian Assange . By releasing reams of emails    stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton    campaign chairman John Podesta , WikiLeaks helped tilt the 2016    election in Trump ’s favor . ’ ’    As president , Trump has n’t come out and said anything laudatory    about WikiLeaks following WikiLeaks massive disclosure of CIA secrets    on Tuesday   —    a treasure trove that some experts already believe    may be more damaging than Edward Snowden ’s revelations . But Trump has n’t condemned WikiLeaks . ’ ’    The recent entries on his Trump feed   —    a pure reflection of his Trump unbridled i d   —    contain vicious attacks on , among other things ,    Arnold Schwarzenegger , the New York Times , and Barack Obama but    not a word about WikiLeaks . Did the president not notice that the    intelligence community he the president has just suffered a    devastating breach of security ? Or did he the president not feel       to comment ? ’ ’    Actually there is a third , even more discomfiting , possibility :    Perhaps Trump is staying silent because he Trump to benefit from    WikiLeaks’ latest revelations .   ’ ’    On Saturday , recall , Trump Trump making     that Obama had    ordered the U. S. intelligence community to wiretap him Trump " How low       President Obama Obama tapp ( sic ) my phones during the very    sacred election process . This is   . Bad ( or sick )    guy ! " ’ ’    The White House could not come up with one iota of evidence to    support    irresponsible allegation , which was denied by FBI    Director    Comey and former Director of National Intelligence    James Clapper . But Trump would not be dissuaded from pursuing    this charge , which serves as a convenient distraction from the    far more serious accusations of possible collusion between the    Trump Trump the Kremlin while Russia was interfering with    the presidential campaign . ’ ’   ’ ’    Is it just a coincidence that WikiLeaks dumped a massive database    pertaining to CIA hacking and wiretapping just three days after    Trump made wiretapping Trump major political issue ? Perhaps so . But    there is    for suspicion . ’ ’    In the first place , WikiLeaks has often WikiLeaks its leaks for WikiLeaks maximum political    . It released 20 WikiLeaks 000 stolen DNC emails    just three days before the Democratic National Convention on July    25 , 2016 . As expected , WikiLeaks generated headlines WikiLeaks DNC    staffers disparaging Sen. Bernie Sanders , buttressing a Trump    campaign effort to prevent Clinton from consolidating Sanders    supporters . DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as a    result , and the Clinton campaign suffered Clinton public    relations damage . ’ ’    As expected , WikiLeaks generated headlines about DNC staffers    disparaging Sen. Bernie Sanders , buttressing a Trump campaign    effort to prevent Clinton from consolidating Clinton supporters .    DNC Chairwoman    Wasserman Schultz resigned as a result , and    the Clinton    a Trump campaign    relations    damage . ’ ’    In the second place , WikiLeaks , which has often leaked American    but never Russian secrets , has been identified by the U. S.    intelligence community as a front for Russian intelligence . In    Russian , the Office of the Director of National Intelligence    released a declassified ’ ’   ’ ’    In January , the Office of the Director the Office of the Director of National Intelligence    Russian military the Director of National Intelligence       to National Intelligence    This was done with a definite purpose : " Putin and    the Russian Government aspired to help    Trump ’s    election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton    and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him . " ’ ’    Trump has consistently resisted the    agency ’s    conclusions , insisting that some   might    have Secretary Clinton    the hacking Secretary Clinton    grudgingly accepting the    findings Trump continuing to claim that the Russian hack had no    impact on the election . ( Given that 70 , 000 votes in three states    were his margin of victory , how does he know what affected the    outcome and what did n’t ? And if WikiLeaks was so inconsequential ,    why did he   its revelations in his    every appearance during the last month of the campaign ? ) ’ ’    The intelligence community    finding that    him       the election spurred Trump to pursue a vendetta against it . For    example , he accused the spooks   —    with no support Putin —    of being    behind BuzzFeed ’s publication of a damning dossier compiled by a    Putin British intelligence officer claiming that the Kremlin had    compiled compromising materials on him .   ’ ’    Trump outrageously : " Intelligence    agencies should never have allowed this fake news to ‘ leak’ into    the public . Putin last shot at me . Are we living in Nazi    Germany ? " His animus against the intelligence agencies has    continued down to his more recent accusations that they allowed    themselves to be used by Obama to wiretap him . The consistent ( if    hardly believable ) storyline from His is that he has the intelligence agencies       the intelligence agencies Russia , and that he is a His of the nefarious    machinations of the American " deep state . " ’      ’ ’    It is significant , therefore    that one of the major storylines to    emerge from the latest WikiLeaks release is that the CIA    supposedly has a program to reuse computer codes from foreign    hackers , thus disguising CIA fingerprints on a hacking operation .    Never mind that there    no evidence that the codes used to break    into the DNC were part of the CIA    CIA database .    outlets    are nevertheless trumpeting these revelations with   such as this one on    Breitbart : " WikiLeaks : CIA Uses ‘ Stolen’ the CIA    to ‘          to Nations Like Russia . "    Internet     are also said to be    playing up these the CIA    online . ’ ’    The implication is clear . Trump was a victim of a " false flag "    operation wherein CIA hackers broke into the DNC and ’ ’    Russians . ’ ’    This may be nutty , but it ’s eminently believable to an audience the CIA    conditioned to believe that    was an inside job and that the    Sandy Hook massacre was staged   —    favorite This of the radio      host Alex Jones , whose work Trump has . Other WikiLeaks    revelations   —    for instance , that the CIA can use Samsung smart    TVs as listening devices   —    lend further credence to Trump ’s    charge that he was secretly wiretapped . ’ ’    Quite apart from its specifics , the WikiLeaks release changes the    subject after a bad few Trump for Trump highlighted by Trump    General Jeff Sessions ’s decision to recuse himself from       Kremlingate probe after he was revealed to have lied under oath    when he denied meeting any Russian representatives . ’ ’    Last week it General Jeff Sessions Trump on the Trump . Now General Jeff Sessions ’s his nemeses in    the U. S. intelligence General Jeff Sessions who are answering embarrassing    questions about how this leak could have occurred and the    contents of the it information . ’ ’    Again , maybe this is entirely coincidental , but WikiLeaks’    history of being used by Russian intelligence to support       should Trump much greater scrutiny not only of who leaked this    information   —    is there a mole in the CIA ?   —    but why it was    released now . ’ ’    Even if there is no active collusion between the White The White House the Kremlin , the CIA to which their agendas coincide is    striking .    Putin and Trump want to discredit the U. Trump    intelligence community because they the U. S.   intelligence community . ’ ’A presidential candidate , Donald Trump the U.
