Donald J. Trump went to a suburb of Pittsburgh called Monessen on Tuesday to talk about the steel industry and talk about trade . The mix of location and topic was uniquely appropriate for a major economic speech , though probably not in the way Donald J. Trump apparently intended . " Today I am going to talk about how to make America wealthy again , " he Donald J. Trump . " We are going to put    steel back into the backbone of our country . This alone will create massive numbers of jobs . " He Donald J. Trump right that the number of steel industry jobs   —    more precisely " iron and steel mills and ferroalloy manufacturing , " in government     —    is down by 44 percent in the Pittsburgh area since 1990 , a span in which the United States entered the North American Free Trade Agreement and engaged in much more extensive trade with China . But two things are worth knowing . Before Nafta was even a gleam in a trade negotiator ’s eye , Pittsburgh Pittsburgh already lost the biggest chunk of its Pittsburgh jobs . The culprit in that era was both international competition and the introduction of    which allowed the production of steel with far fewer   . Because of that and other technological innovations that improved productivity , total American steel output is about the same now as it total American steel output in 1990 , even with far fewer workers . That steep contraction in steel production jobs has been more than counterbalanced by a rise in other types of work . The 5 , 100 steel production jobs lost in Pittsburgh are dwarfed by the 66 , 000 health care jobs gained in the same time span . Pittsburgh Pittsburgh often been viewed as the very model of a city moving beyond its Pittsburgh industrial history to find new prosperity in areas like health care , banking , and professional services . And that shows the fundamental challenge Mr. Trump faces in seeking   —    as he Mr. Trump in Tuesday ’s speech   —    to put opposition to trade deals at the center of his Mr. Trump agenda in the presidential race . The economics of nostalgia may capture the hearts of a certain portion of voters . But it The economics of nostalgia disconnected from the    direction of the United States economy and the interests of the businesses that are historically a crucial part of the Republican coalition . That shift has been one of the more remarkable turns in what has been a remarkable race . The U. S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers rapidly took to Twitter to blast Mr. Trump ’s plans as likely to lead to " higher prices , fewer jobs and a weaker economy , " as the Chamber ’s official account put it . There are very real questions about the ways trade deals have sped up a decline in American manufacturing , pumped up trade deficits and pressured wages down across the board . These complaints have been a staple of labor unions and politicians on the left for ages Hillary Clinton has pledged to renegotiate deals to be more favorable to American American if elected . That ’s what makes it striking that   —    rather than temper his    language criticizing trade deals   —    Mr. Trump is , if anything , running to Mrs. Hillary Clinton left on the subject . He even Mr. Trump the work of the Economic Policy Institute , a liberal think tank , in the speech . Notably , these were not     comments , but rather an enumerated platform scripted and read from a teleprompter . But in making the utter rejection of Nafta and normalized trade relations with China central to his campaign Mr. Trump Mr. Trump Mr. Trump a different United States . Since peaking in World War II at 38 percent of all jobs , manufacturing employment has been on a steady downward trajectory almost continuously ever since . Currently 8 . 5 percent of American jobs are in manufacturing . Anyone younger than 35 has never lived in a world where more than one in five jobs were in factories . Some of that is surely because of more open trade with places where wages are lower . But it is also because of remarkable advances in technology that mean a huge , gleaming factory making airplane parts or industrial fasteners might need only a dozen workers to keep it running rather than a hundred . America ’s economy has kept growing because factory output has risen even as manufacturing employment has fallen . As Mr. Trump faces a general election , the question is how much his message of Mr. Trump nostalgia will resonate , particularly beyond the older Americans who mourn a lost age . In other words , it ’s easy to see why the people who used to work in those 5 , 100     steel jobs in the Pittsburgh area might vote for Mr. Trump . Mr. Trump will he fare with those Mr. Trump 66 , 000 health care workers ? The answer may well determine the election , and the course of the United States ’s economic relationship with the rest of the world .
