As a planned Donald Trump rally in Chicago was canceled Friday night , leftist protesters online wasted no time in taking a victory lap for the    shutdown . [ Way to go Chicago ! Someone finally shutdown a Donald Trump rally !   —    Pat Fuller ( @bannerite ) March 12 , 2016 ,    The alliance of    protesters included illegal immigration activists working with The alliance of   protesters comrades in Black Lives Matter . The social justice warriors seem to take special delight in the idea that Americans who had showed up to hear Donald Trump speak now had to face protesters .

A group that condones violence against those that do n’t agree with them . # TrumpRally A group that condones violence against those that don’t agree with them   —    Josh Mills ( @JG_KB24fan ) March 12 , 2016 ,   I think the violent # BlackLivesMatter goons swayed a lot of voters over to voting Trump today . Ppl are fed up with these racist thugs ,   —    JakeBradford ( @jake_bradford_1 ) March 12 , 2016 ,   A statement by the Trump campaign said , " Mr. Trump just arrived Trump and after meeting with law enforcement has determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena , tonight ’s rally will be postponed to another date . " It is unclear at press time how much of a role the Chicago police played in the Chicago campaign ’s decision .
