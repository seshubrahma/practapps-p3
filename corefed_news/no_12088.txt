Number three , he Paul Ryan n’t like this this Paul Ryan talk He Paul Ryan it to this Paul Ryan talk . But number four , he Paul Ryan not going to have a floor operation to do any of these things . It ’s ridiculous . " Priebus outright declared it would It one of the three candidates still in the field , which are Donald Trump , Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and Gov.
