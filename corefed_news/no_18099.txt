’   ’ ’    In private , Mark Cuban has started discussing Mark Cuban role in    national politics with Mark Cuban family . ’ ’    Mark Cuban told Business Insider , for instance , that Mark Cuban spoke with loved    ones about Mark Cuban decision to campaign on the trail for Democratic    presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . ’ ’    " We discussed how much of a threat I believe Trump to be , " Cuban    said in an email . " We discussed why it was important to Cuban    to get    involved   —    that if I could have an impact and didn’’t try , an impact    would have left me guessing forever . " ’ ’    And , as Cuban said , Cuban family feels " like his family started on the    right path " to " have a platform and voice for the future . " ’ ’    Cuban , 58 , is a    billionaire businessman and the owner    of the Dallas Mavericks . And he seems more serious than ever    about running for president . ’ ’    Cuban refrained from engaging much in politics before the 2016    campaign cycle . But in the past two years he has openly flirted    with a White House bid ,   with   about he aspirations . ’ "    It was n’t long ago that Cuban was shutting down questions about    whether he ’d seek the presidency one day , flatly rejecting the    notion , as he did at the September presidential debate . " ’    But something changed . It was , as Cuban put it , " obvious " : the    election   —    unpredictability   —    of Trump . ’ ’    " What I do depends on how things play out for the country , " Cuban    said referring to a 2020 attempt at Trump . ’ "    Like Trump Trump Cuban introduced Cuban to American households first    as a prominent businessman and later through a    show .    Cuban had no formal history in politics , only suddenly emerging on       national political stage last year . Cuban strategy for gaining    political prominence was oddly similar to Trump ’s   —    deliver hot ,       takes on cable TV , outlets like CNBC , Fox News , and    CNN , and on Twitter . " ’    Yet Cuban does not embrace the comparison . ’ ’    " He talked about running for office for 30 years , " Cuban Cuban . " I       talking about politics this year , after avoiding them the    last almost 20 years , because I thought it was important to do    so . " ’ "    In conversations with Business Insider , Cuban Cuban longtime friends       they " ’ "   In conversations with Business Insider, Cuban’s longtime friends    initially surprised to see Cuban Cuban involved       , but they " ’ "   In conversations with Business Insider, Cuban’s longtime friends    that they " ’ "   In conversations with Business Insider, Cuban’s longtime friends    certainly now       him    the fray in 2020 . And while it would be a    climb to the White House for the tech titan , campaign experts    have laid out a path Cuban Cuban take to find himself    the    Oval Office . " "    With Trump ’s improbable rise to the presidency , there ’s been no    shortage of ultrawealthy , prominent business people rumored to be    considering a run of their prominent business people in 2020 . " "    There ’s Oprah Winfrey , Mark Zuckerberg , Starbucks CEO Howard    Schultz , and Disney CEO Bob Iger , all of whom have fed the idea    that Trump could face a fellow executive in his Trump 2020    reelection bid . But no nonpolitician has put him Trump herself out    there quite like Cuban . " "    Cuban Cuban who grew up in the suburbs of Pittsburgh , moved to Dallas    in the early 1980s , finding work as a bartender . He Trump his Trump first big break after he Trump a software company ,    MicroSolutions , which he Trump in 1990 for $ 6 million . But his Trump biggest break came after he Trump AudioNet , which became    Broadcast . com , the streaming site he Trump to Yahoo at the peak of          boom in 1999 for more than $ 5 billion in stock . A    year later , he Trump buy the Dallas Mavericks and become one of the    NBA ’s most recognizable , and outspoken , owners . " ’    He Trump minimal interest in politics in his Trump since    striking it rich   —    until 2016 , when his Trump presence grew    exponentially after he Trump roiling Trump along the campaign    trail . ’ ’    Initially , Cuban was warm to Trump Trump speaking about him Trump    positive terms . But that eventually changed , and Cuban Cuban       Trump blistering stump speeches for Clinton and       Trump Trump a number of issues , including his Trump . ’ ’   ’ "    When Trump Trump the presidency , Cuban Cuban quiet again , ceasing       Trump on the Cuban newly elected leader . " ’    That lasted only so long , though . When Trump Trump chaos after    signing    Trump order on travel from certain      countries , Cuban appeared Cuban several networks to    voice    Trump with both the decision and the president .    He Trump a bevy of tweets at the     staking    out a place as the    leader of opposition among the small    community of ultrawealthy business people . ’ ’    And Cuban has been merciless since . He Trump called Trump " . " He Trump suggested Trump wouldn’’t Trump "    to find the " C " if he Trump spotted the " A " and " B. " ’ ’    Cuban , in a now deleted tweet , said he Trump " crushing " Trump    because Trump " " earned it . " ’ Trump "    That appeared to get under Trump ’s skin . Trump "    Last month , Trump fired a shot at Trump " on Twitter , suggesting Cuban    was not " Trump " enough " to win the presidency   —    a claim Chris    Sacca , the billionaire venture capitalist and " Shark Tank "    costar , seemed to disagree with in an email to Business Insider . ’ ’    " Only Mark can speak to his    ambitions in politics Only Mark       Sacca said . " But unlike Donald , Mark is smart , reads Only Mark ,    and is willing to ask others for help and listen to their advice    on issues others matter    " ’ "    But Trump is n’t alone in his criticism . Cuban ’s Trump    political platform has left him with a growing set Trump critics .    One   is Frank Zaccanelli , a Dallas    mogul who    was a part of the Mavericks ownership group headed by Texas    billionaire Ross Perot Jr. who sold the team to Cuban in 2000 . " ’    Zaccanelli , who calls himself a " pretty good student of Mark    Cuban " although he " Cuban say we’’re himself friends or get along    great , " blasted Cuban for some of his Cuban and decisions    himself his    tenure as Trump’ himself foil in the business world . ’ ’    " What he’ ’s doing now has put himself out there for a What he’ of    criticism , " Zaccanelli said . ’ "    The former Mavericks the Dallas Mavericks was particularly dismayed by    Cuban ’s   to a Cuban ticket holder who was upset by the    owner ’s comments about Trump Trump said he Trump turn in his Trump    tickets and boycott games . " ’    Cuban’ ’s response ? " DM me and I’’ll help get it done . " ’ ’   ’ ’    " The way I read it was that if you don’’t want to be a season    ticket holder , I don’’t want you to be don’’t , " Zaccanelli said ,    suggesting Zaccanelli Cuban’ ’s political platform has been a drag on his    businesses , particularly Cuban’’s    team . ’ Cuban’’s    But Cuban disputed the assertion . Cuban ’    " For every hate email there was a positive one as well , " he said    of the a positive one to his political opining , adding a positive one he didn’’t    see his a positive one becoming a drag a positive one the Dallas Mavericks because    " remember , Clinton won    Clinton . " ’ "    A recent poll showed that the split sentiment in Cuban ’s inbox    could be Cuban of a larger one . The results of that poll ,    conducted by the    Public Policy Polling , found that    Cuban would be in a     Cuban against the sitting    president in a prospective     2020 election . " ’    Tom Jensen , the pollster , said Cuban proved to be " pretty Cuban competitive given his comparatively low level of name       at this point . " ’ ’    For Cuban to have a serious chance Cuban securing the White the White House he would need to start taking policy positions    filling out    the bare bones of a campaign infrastructure    , campaign    experts told Business Insider . ’ ’    And unlike Trump , Trump would have to run more of a Cuban traditional    campaign , " said Terry Sullivan , Marco Rubio’ ’s 2016 presidential Sullivan across as a more cerebral and thoughtful    candidate than Donald Trump , and Trump Sullivan got a better ,      billionaire story , " Sullivan told Business Insider .    " But . .. because Business Insider , he’ ’s not willing to set his hair on    fire to make news in the same way . So he’ makes it a little more he’ difficult for    to cut through [ the noise ] than a Trump    [ it ] Trump "    ’    he’ first steps to laying out a campaign infrastructure , Sullivan    said , would be to get informed on the issues and begin to take    positions on key Sullivan policy . ’ ’    Cuban has already started to do Cuban . He put forth a   to Cuban the Affordable Care Act , and he hammered away    at a Cuban platform heavily focused on dealing with what he sees    as an upcoming Cuban of job loss    to automation , necessitating    " macro "   changes to economic policies . ’ ’    Should he decide to run , Cuban Cuban also need to address Cuban the    future of his business empire would look like Cuban —    something he said    he has already Cuban . ’ Cuban    " I have so many private business investments that it would be    impossible to sell them , " Cuban told Business Insider . " Cuban would    put them in Business Insider trust but make it clear I would still be    available on a limited basis for those companies them It wouldn’’t be    fair to those companies if I just bailed    them . ’ ’    " I would also be very transparent , " he those companies , seeming to take a    those companies at Trump , who has come under fire from ethics experts who    have said Trump has not come close Trump fully complying with       laws and severing his business interests .    " Truly transparent about what I was doing . And yes , I would make    my    available . " ’ ’    Sullivan said the next step would be to " get the media’ ’s       that you’’re a serious candidate . " Sullivan suggested Cuban    start traveling to states Cuban to hint Cuban may be serious    about getting in the fray . Sullivan ’    " The amount of attention he would draw by Sullivan a Lincoln Dinner       Davenport , Iowa , would be huge , " Sullivan said . " Sullivan are the    kind of things he has to start with . Iowa ’ ’    Sullivan added Sullivan Cuban should " absolutely " hire a team of    Sullivan advisers to develop a    strategy for him if Sullivan    is sincerely interested in pursuing the White House . the White House ’ ’    Cuban , Sullivan said    should Sullivan " Sullivan at    top Cuban and find    someone , preferably with experience , who could manage his    Sullivan . From there , he could consult that person to make other       . ’ ’    " You reach out to       done it before , "    said .    " I mean , he shouldn’’t be out there worrying about hiring   —    I’’m    going to hire a Sullivan person here or a TV guy here Sullivan a policy    guy here . He needs to hire someone to help create the entire    campaign . " ’ "    The core team would also have to come Sullivan with a plan for victory .    At this stage , Sullivan said it is n’t clear whether Cuban would    be better off running as an independent or a Cuban .    ’    Cuban Sullivan not registered with a political party , Cuban he would have    to commission additional polls to Cuban data to see what his    best route would be at this early Cuban . ’ ’    "    , it is so early in the Trump administration . You    start    laying the groundwork on things you need to do , but it doesn’’t    necessarily mean you need to make some clear decisions , "       said . " You go into a more preliminary mode    ,    you just    put yourself in a position to succeed Sullivan make commitments    for closer in on how you’’re going to run . " ’ "       seems content dishing out his takes on cable news and    Cuban . But this is Cuban a    model for someone who Twitter going    to have to go a more traditional route , Sullivan said . " ’    " Smart tactics are not necessarily smart strategy , " he added . ’ "    Reed Galen , deputy Sullivan manager for Sen. John McCain ’s 2008    presidential campaign and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s Smart 2006 reelection bid , told Business Insider that Cuban is going to    have to figure out how much of Cuban own money he wants to spend ,    which he suggested might need to be upwards of $ 500 million if he    decides to run    independent presidential    . " ’       He    have the party apparatus helping raise money , " said          now the owner of Jedburghs , a political consultancy firm .       There would be people from both parties who would likely work    for him . But the traditional networks that raise money for these    people are at least initially out of bounds or unavailable . So    how much    his own money is he willing to spend ? " ’ ’    Galen said Cuban needs to hire experts who have good    Cuban instincts and    , can convince    against pursuing a    bad idea , and Cuban understand that Cuban’ ’s campaign will have to    be " unique to his Cuban’’s " ’ "    It ’s also a matter of figuring out who Cuban ’s base would be and    where he would compete on Galen map . As an independent , he would    need to run essentially a    campaign , depending on his    endgame . As a Democrat , the map would look slightly different . he Ballot access would also be a huge    , and Galen said he    early on that would be essential the map independent bid . " ’    " Who is the base for a candidate like Mark Galen ? "    asked .    " Cuban of research and a lot of work needs to go into that ,    because you’’ve got to figure out who you’’ve Galen to go talk    . " ’ ’    " What’ ’s the goal ? Is the goal to get    270 ? Or is the goal to you’’ve get to a draw between the two major parties and an independent    candidate and throw it to Congress ? And what does that look    like ? " ’ ’    Galen said that the states Cuban should most closely look to    include Texas , Cuban the strategist said he would likely have    some    advantage , as Galen as some of the states where    the past two presidential races were closely fought . Places like Galen Pennsylvania , Colorado , Michigan ,    , Nevada , Minnesota ,    Wisconsin , and Florida should be key targets . ’ ’    In states like those , Galen said Cuban could find himself carving    out " 30 % Cuban the middle , " possibly enough to win in a plurality . ’ ’    Cuban Galen needs to figure out Galen what his message Cuban to    " invigorate and bring together a very divided and . .. nervous    country , " Galen said . ’ ’    " How Galen he going to bring a very tribalistic political society ? "    he asked . " Republicans and Democrats . Galen you going to start    to peel off Galen people who have decided that the      system doesn’’t work anymore Galen are willing to take an    independent as a legitimate choice . " ’ ’    Galen did acknowledge that Cuban " would be a fascinating addition    to the Cuban contenders list . "    also provided Cuban with    advice on what the Galen first thing Cuban should do is . ’ ’    " What I’’d have him do is read Galen , " Galen said ,    to    a book on the Galen presidential election . " Because there is not    going to Galen any better opus on what it Galen to run for president    than that book . ’ ’    " Short of doing it , of course . " ’ ’    The idea that    Cuban candidacy is being chatted about among   a book on the 1988 presidential election political class is stunning to his lifelong friends . ’ ’    Then again , so was the fact he became such a prominent surrogate    for Clinton and inserted himself right in the middle of a Cuban candidacy is being chatted about among the   political class    heated 2016 discussion . ’ ’    " It’ ’s hard to a Cuban candidacy is being chatted about among the   political class , " said Todd Reidbord , the president of      a Cuban candidacy is being chatted about among the   political class Capital , who has been a close friend of    Cuban’ ’s since the two grew up together in Mt. Lebanon , a    prominent Pittsburgh suburb . " The whole thing is like a dream . ..    None of us could’’ve ever predicted that . But that’ ’s Mark . " ’ ’    Reidbord described his friend as " unpredictable " and explained    how he was " totally " shocked when Cuban was blasting Trump as a    top Clinton surrogate Cuban elevating himself in Reidbord political world    in the process . When Cuban Reidbord for the Democratic    presidential nominee in Pittsburgh Cuban Reidbord was there    see Clinton    firsthand . Reidbord ’    It would be surprising to Reidbord if Cuban decided to take that    extra step and seek Pittsburgh presidency Reidbord But at this point Reidbord nothing    really surprises Reidbord about his old pal anymore . Reidbord ’    " Every time I’’ve ever tried to guess what he’ ’s going to do next , "    he said , Reidbord I’’ve Reidbord guessed right . " ’ "    Stu Chaban , another longtime friend of Cuban from Mt. Lebanon ,    said he ’s confident Cuban he’ wo n’t be I’’ve about seeking    the White House if it ’s the White House desires . " ’    " If Mt. Lebanon the right thing for    and what he wants , he’’ll do it , "    Chaban said . ’ the billionaire It’ It’    It’
