Another Fox News debate , another two hours of proof that the " fair and balanced " network is nothing more than a super PAC for Marco Rubio , who , by the way , had a terrible night . In their naked pursuit of Donald Trump ’s scalp , moderators Chris Wallace , Bret Baier , and Megyn Kelly used every cheap trick in the book . [ None of the other candidates faced dramatic graphics . Donald Trump’s did . None of the other candidates faced video of past statements . * Donald Trump’s did .   Donald Trump’s was never asked to attack Donald Trump’s rivals . On at least three occasions , Donald Trump’s rivals were invited to attack him Donald Trump’s WALLACE : But it was your video and the serious question is , because the suggestion is , do you think that Donald Donald Trump’s naive about the threat that Vladimir Putin represents ? WALLACE : Mr. Trump WALLACE increase because he says it Donald Trump’s price American workers any increase of the world market . Is he wrong about Donald Trump’s ? WALLACE : Senator Rubio    …      Please tell Mr. Trump why Donald Trump’s unprepared to Donald Trump’s     chief . On a number of occasions , Wallace and Kelly tossed off their WALLACE as moderators to actually Wallace and Kelly Trump , in the Donald Trump’s of tripping him up or cornering Donald Trump’s . As bad Donald Trump’s the mainstream media has been to Republican presidential candidates over the years , I have never seen anything like this . This is just one of those exchanges . Here Kelly compares Trump to a con Kelly and Bernie Madoff ! KELLY : Let me just set Kelly record , and then you guys can have at it . There was Trump University the record which was a business that you started , and it was marketed   …      the record :    … Donald Trump’s   …      KELLY :    …      to many people Kelly there is a    of over 5 , 000 plaintiffs against you , Mr. Trump   …      TRUMP :    …      Right   …      KELLY :    …      And , it involves veterans Kelly involves teachers , and it involves    little guys , working it , and    working it and middle class who say that they were fleeced , who say that it was as scam . The class has been certified , and in that case you    the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed . TRUMP : That case was thrown out against her   …      TRUMP : that case      The lead plaintiff is now getting out of the case because it ’s the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed her   …      KELLY that case …      But , the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed happened was   … her TRUMP :    …      Excuse me , the lead plaintiff signed a letter saying how great it was , and it on tape the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed it was . KELLY : OK , no , but   — the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed standby . But , what the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed in that KELLY:    was you    her . The court threw out your    and that case pay almost $ 800 , 000 dollars       fees of hers , and you    the same argument about 98 percent of the people being happy with Trump University    And , that woman in particular signing a survey saying she liked it while someone was standing over her shoulder      TRUMP :    …      She ’s    to get out of the case .    ’s trying to get out of the case           KELLY :    …      And this is      —    standby , this the case Court of Appeals found . They said that the plaintiffs against you are like the Madoff victims   …      TRUMP : Oh , give me a the Court of Appeals   …      KELLY :    …      This is what the Court of Appeals said . TRUMP : Give me a break . KELLY KELLY:    what the court of appeals said . the Court of Appeals a break Appeals KELLY : They found that victims KELLY:    con artists often sing the praises of the Court of Appeals realize they have been fleeced TRUMP: Give me a break , let ’s see what happens in court . This is a civil case . Very easy to have settled victims of con artists Could settle They now They Very easy to have TRUMP: Give me a break . Let ’s see what happens TRUMP: Give me a break the end of a couple years when this case is over , OK ? KELLY : It has been going This five years . TRUMP : Yes , it has TRUMP: Give me a break going for a long time .    UPDATE : Kelly also all but declared Trump a liar for his clam that Trump University received an " A " TRUMP: Give me a break from the Better It Bureau . It looks like she did not do her homework KELLY   There were two TRUMP: Give me a break moments even lower KELLY that . The first came from Kelly , who used leaked reports and unsubstantiated rumors surrounding an     interview KELLY supposedly had with KELLY    New York Times .   Apparently , the Times leaked information about the     interview to the    BuzzFeed , who in turn , without hearing the audio , TRUMP: Give me a break a    attack against Trump , accusing him of saying one thing the   New York Times Times and another to the voters regarding immigration . BuzzFeed then demanded Trump prove he ’s not a communist liar . There is nothing more TRUMP: Give me a break in journalism TRUMP: Give me a break an     situation . This is the   New York Times be inviolable . To see the New York Times and TRUMP: Give me a break behave TRUMP: Give me a break this way is one thing . To see Megyn Kelly and Fox News use a sacred     conversation to launch a relentless    attack , was beyond disgraceful . Here are the lowlights : BuzzFeed : Back in January , you gave an     interview to the New York Times . It was apparently audiotaped . Now , a recent report in Buzzfeed citing sources at the Times reports that in Megyn Kelly interview you expressed flexibility when it comes to your immigration policy the New York Times to your promise to deport the 11 million people who are now BuzzFeed here illegally . You have suggested the New York Times the New York Times have expressed some an    interview to the New York Times it comes to the size of the wall that you want to build . But did you tell them , specifically , that you are flexible when it comes to your deportation plan ?    …      KELLY : Mr. Trump , we will let respond , but will you release the tapes ? Will you authorize of The Times to release the tapes ?    …      KELLY : Will you release the tapes ? KELLY : Are you now or have you ever lied about immigration ? Okay , I made up that last one . This is Fox News going way the tapes we ’ve seen in KELLY past from CNBC ’s John the tapes KELLY ’s George Stephanopoulos . In the future , any Republican stupid enough to talk to the New York Times , BuzzFeed , or Fox News in an     capacity , deserves whatever knife he or she gets in the back . Near the end of the debate , Fox News became a parody of itself by airing the last 30 seconds or so of this    ad Fox News John Kasich campaign :   —     —    After the clip played and everyone had a good laugh at Trump ’s expense , Fox News Wallace ’s question to Kasich Fox News But it was your video and the serious question is , because the suggestion is , do you think that Donald Trump is naive about the threat that Vladimir Putin represents ? Fox News ’s brand and reputation is already in freefall . Thursday John Kasich , in service to Marco Rubio and the Republican Establishment , Fox News stooped lower than NBC News or CNN   Trump’s something many of us never thought possible . * To justify singling Trump out with graphics and videos , Fox News announced at the beginning that the other candidates had faced these in the debate Fox News .
