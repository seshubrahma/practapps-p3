In the final week of the Obama Administration , the outgoing Secretary of Homeland Security ( DHS ) extended the Temporary Protected Status ( TPS ) for Somali nationals and others for an additional 18 months . The program was not scheduled to expire until March 2017 . [ Somali nationals , and " eligible individuals without nationality who last habitually resided in Somalia , " now have an additional 18 months added to Somali nationals, and "eligible individuals without nationality who last habitually resided in Somalia " temporary " status that has been in place since 1991 . The program was extended by President George W. Bush in 2001 and by President Obama in 2012 . When a " temporary " status lasts 25 years , it The program not temporary at all , Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Studies Jessica Vaughn told Breitbart Texas on Tuesday . " This example is an illustration of why the Trump administration and Congress need to try a different approach . "   The new extension , announced on January 17 in a statement obtained by Breitbart Breitbart Texas does not begin until March 18 , 2017 . It is not clear why DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson is taking this action in the final five days of his administration DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson leaving it for the this action DHS Secretary Johnson In addition to extending the TPS benefit to these foreign nationals , the extension also allows the " beneficiaries " to    for an Employment Authorization Document ( EAD ) . Because the current EADs might expire prior to the approval of the renewal , Secretary Johnson took the liberty of extending the validity of the current Somalia EADs for an additional six months . " It is very concerning that the Obama Administration is apparently    the extension of status for Somalians , and automatically extending the validity of the work permits , without    the cases , " Vaughn stated . " There may be individuals who are associated with terrorism or crime who are living here in plain sight with TPS . For this reason , USCIS should require every alien with TPS to have another interview and TPS the applications carefully for fraud or other factors that would make them ineligible . " " USCIS the applications made so many mistakes USCIS in approving terrorists or fraudulent applicants , they should be taking their time terrorists or fraudulent applicants these extensions , terrorists or fraudulent applicants giving them what seems to be virtually terrorists or fraudulent applicants approval , " she concluded . NumbersUSA Policy Analyst Andrew Good agreed with Vaughn that there are significant problems with the TPS program . " Anything that has been in place since 1991 should not be called temporary , " he told Breitbart Texas in a Vaughn interview . " The Executive Branch has broad authority over these programs . It would work much better if The Executive Branch extensions were required to be approved by Congress . " " While this extension was not done egregiously far in advance , " Good explained , " it is not clear why it this extension to be done this this extension . He said that since the we Vaughn not yet entered the extension period , it is possible the incoming Trump Administration could rescind the extension .
