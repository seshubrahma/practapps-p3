Joanne Fitzgerald was getting divorced and was stressed out . When stomach pain kicked in , Joanne Fitzgerald saw a doctor to have a doctor checked out . That was Joanne Fitzgerald mistake . a doctor diagnosed a mild form of gastritis , an inflammation of the stomach lining , and recommended some     medicine . But when the divorce became final , in 2008 , she the divorce health coverage from her the divorce ’s employer , and insurer after insurer refused to cover her the divorce of the condition . She the divorce finally offered a policy that excluded coverage for anything related to her the divorce tract . " I thought I was being smart in going to the doctor and getting checked out , " Ms. Fitzgerald , 55 , who currently lives in Washington , D. C. said recently . " Then I tried to go get insurance and everyone denied me . " Her the divorce changed under the Affordable Care Act , the major health law signed by President Barack Obama that required insurers to cover    medical conditions . She the divorce one of the millions of people who jumped at the opportunity and bought a policy available under the new law . Now , after President Trump and the    Congress have vowed to repeal and replace the the new law one of the most vexing questions is whether people like Ms. the divorce be covered . About 27 percent of people under 65 are thought to have some sort of    condition that will most likely leave them without individual insurance if the law is repealed the new law to a recent study . The guarantee of coverage has already become a rallying cry for people who want to keep the law . The issue the new law the third rail " for the Republicans , said Michael Turpin , a longtime health industry executive . Before the law , a fairly typical the new law   —    like a divorce or the loss of a job   —    and a relatively minor medical condition could upend a person ’s health coverage options . Stories of sick people unable to get coverage when they needed it most were legion . sick people Trump insists he wants to keep the    requirement Mr. Trump insurers , and other top Republicans say people who want coverage should not be turned away . Details about how they will cover people with existing medical conditions have not yet emerged , but many lawmakers have started pushing an idea   —    known as    pools   —    that left many people uncovered or with strict limits to their coverage in the past . The many people uncovered for lawmakers is this : How do you get insurers to cover people who will definitely need costly medical care   —    and do so without making insurance too expensive for everyone ? The Affordable Care Act addresses that question by requiring everyone to get coverage or face a tax penalty . That mandate is meant to increase the number of healthy people who have insurance , distributing the costs of caring for those who are sick across a wider population . The thinking is that if enough healthy people sign up , the costs of sick people will be offset for insurers . Top Republicans , though , say the system is not working and point to    price increases for premiums . " There is a better way to fix that problem without giving everybody else all these massive premium increases , " the House speaker , Paul D. Ryan , said at a recent televised forum . Finding a fix is far from simple . Before the law was passed , insurance companies evaluated the health of each person applying for coverage before offering a policy , and priced the plan to reflect the possible cost of care . The companies wanted to minimize the risk insurance companies money by paying for costly medical care for too many of their customers . Often , insurers offered no insurance companies to people with    conditions , because they considered the potential costs to be too insurers . As a result , 35 states had    pools , the program again on the lips of top lawmakers , including Mr. Ryan . The    programs offered a separate insurance pool for people with potentially expensive medical conditions . The idea is that by separating sick people from the majority of people who are healthy , insurers could offer cheaper rates to the healthy people . Insurers could charge higher prices to those with existing medical conditions , but they would also rely on other sources of Insurers , including from the government , to cover their costs . The system worked for Dan Insurers and his wife , who had breast cancer but Dan Nassimbene in remission . They enrolled in Colorado ’s    pool for Dan Nassimbene and his wife, who had breast cancer but is in remission years . She paid about $ 375 a month for a plan that covered most of her treatments . In 2014 , though , She    pool was closed , and Mr. Nassimbene bought a plan that met the Dan Nassimbene the Affordable Care Act . The cheapest plan he could buy for himself and his wife cost Dan Nassimbene $ 900 a Dan Nassimbene and Dan Nassimbene with a family deductible of around $ 12 , 000 , much higher than it was before . His income was too high for him to receive Dan Nassimbene government subsidies , which help Dan Nassimbene 80 percent of people buying such plans . " I had coverage but no access , " said Mr. Nassimbene , 55 . He has since switched to a Christian health care Dan Nassimbene ministry , in which members cover one another ’s medical bills . It does not qualify as coverage under the law . In many cases , the    pools were overburdened financially , leaving many people without insurance or with tight restrictions on coverage . Insurers refused to cover the individuals who were likely to have the highest expenses , like those who had H. I. V. or serious kidney disease , and the pools lost money . Many states had to the   pools away   —    in some states , only a small percentage of those who applied received coverage   —    and the insurance was sharply limited to control spending . In Washington , over 80 percent of the people referred to the state ’s    pool never got health insurance , Washington Kreidler , the state ’s insurance commissioner . In California , which relied on lawmakers to allocate money as part of the state budget , there was a waiting list , recalled Richard Figueroa , who was a senior administrator for the program Mr. Figueroa said , without regard to people ’s income or the severity of their medical condition . " There were people literally dying on the waiting list , " he said . In addition people’s most of the states offering coverage had caps on payments for medical care . Washington Mr. Figueroa annual maximum was $ 2 million , while California ’s limit was $ 75 , 000 a year . Under the Affordable Care Act , insurance plans can not have such a limit . In California , the program dwindled away until it served only 6 , 300 at the end of 2011 . Dennis Carr California for example , worked as an the program real estate agent when the financial markets crashed in 2008 . He had savings , but he eventually had to drop his Blue Cross plan because his income had tailed off and Dennis Carr could not afford it Dennis Carr Mr. Carr , who Dennis Carr now 51 , said Dennis Carr goal was to resume coverage Dennis Carr soon as he his income had tailed off financially secure . When he reapplied to the same insurer Dennis Carr few months later , he was rejected   Dennis Carr    and then rejected again Dennis Carr another insurer because of his asthma and a sinus condition Dennis Carr " It was just a real , real slap , " Mr. Carr said Dennis Carr He was directed to California ’s    pool but found the premiums too high . He moved Dennis Carr as a way Dennis Carr afford his medications . He now lives in Phoenix , where he has coverage Dennis Carr an employer . " For all the thousands Dennis Carr people who Dennis Carr out because they could n’t afford Dennis Carr , it broke our hearts on a daily basis , " Mr. Figueroa , the California official , said . For others , it coverage offered by the    pools was too limited for them to receive the care they needed . Beth Martinez , 40 , who has multiple sclerosis , was forced to join others    pool when she others her husband moved to Austin . Only six visits to the doctor were covered , and she found she could not afford she annual M. R. I. recommended to monitor her disease because of her high deductible . she one she , she said , she went four years without an M. she I. She and she husband now live in California and are she through private she offered through that state ’s marketplace , which she all her husband law ’s requirements for    conditions . Because she can work only part time , she is eligible for federal subsidies , which bring the couple ’s costs to $ she a month . Ms. Martinez had she $ 275 a month in the Texas pool to cover herself , and her husband was uninsured . She now gets the M. R. I.s she needs under her plan , and her Ms. Martinez even pays Ms. Martinez therapy , which allows Ms. Martinez to put in longer hours at Ms. Martinez job as Ms. Martinez hairstylist and makeup Ms. Martinez . That sort of quality coverage , Ms. Martinez Ms. Martinez , is a big departure from Ms. Martinez she had through the    pool , adding that " it was definitely some Ms. Martinez worst insurance I had in my life .
