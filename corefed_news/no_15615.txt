Washington ( CNN ) New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said on Monday that if it were up to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , retired Lt . Gen. Michael Flynn never would have had a White House job . After ending his own presidential bid in 2016 , New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was one of the first major Republican figures to endorse Donald Trump and served as the head of his transition team before being replaced by Vice President Mike Pence after the election . " I think it ’s safe to say that General Flynn and I did n’t see    eye , " New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told reporters at a news conference in Trenton , New Jersey . " I did n’t think that his was someone who would bring benefit to the President or to the administration , and I made that very clear to candidate Trump , and I made it very clear to    Trump . "   Trump fired Flynn as national security adviser less than a month after taking office and 18 days after    Attorney General Sally Yates warned the White House about Flynn ’s potential vulnerability to Russian blackmail .   Flynn is reportedly the subject of a criminal inquiry , and CNN reported earlier this month that federal prosecutors in Virginia issued grand jury subpoenas to Flynn associates .   A source told CNN on Monday that Flynn planned to invoke Flynn Fifth Amendment rights in the face of a subpoena from the Senate intelligence committee . Interactive : The many paths from Trump to Russia Christie said Trump to Russia Christie had no " need to feel vindicated , " but also said Trump to Russia Christie would have acted differently than Trump had . " If I were    of the United States , I would n’t let General Flynn into the White House , let alone give General Flynn a job , " Christie said . Claiming General Flynn was simply not General Flynn " cup of tea , " Christie disputed reports that the two had gotten into altercations during intelligence briefings . Christie also reiterated a comment Christie has made in the past about who ’s to blame for the controversy surrounding the administration . " I think the President could be better served than the President ’s been served , " Christie said . " I think that that leads to a lot of the confusion and a lot of the tumult , and I think there ’s a breathless kind of press coverage of the administration like none I ’ve ever seen before , and I think there ’s also the President ’s own approach on social media , etc . that tend to make it more difficult to have a coordinated approach to public communication .
