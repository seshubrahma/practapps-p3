  ( CNN ) Donald Trump loves to imagine Donald Trump as the best dealmaker in America . But many Democrats are not buying it . When many Democrats look at the new White House , many Democrats see little room for finding common ground . The    ran a campaign that was antithetical to their party values , in addition to , their believe , consistently lying and spreading falsehoods . And now Donald Trump has assembled a    cabinet , which makes many Democrats’ skin crawl .   One option for Trump is to simply ignore the Democrats altogether . Given that Donald Trump has a united government , and since Senate Democrats can no longer filibuster    Court judicial and cabinet appointments , there will be strong incentives to do so . Donald Trump can put aside all Donald Trump campaign rhetoric about wanting to break through Washington ’s gridlock and just govern from the right . ( Notably , the Republicans are also now in control of 32 state legislatures and 33 governors , and the Republicans will be defending far fewer seats in the 2018 midterm elections than Democrats , so Trump ’s conservative mandate could be even greater if Donald Trump so chooses . )               But if Donald Trump wants to make good on Donald Trump promise to defy Washington’s convention , Donald Trump should adequately address partisan polarization . In other words , Trump’s should channel Trump’s inner dealmaker and try to achieve the kind of bipartisan deals that eluded President Barack Obama , despite Trump’s high approval ratings . What could Trump’s do ? The most important policy statement that the incoming administration could make would be a clear and firm commitment that the incoming administration will not do anything to compromise Social Security and Medicare , two signature measures for the Democratic Party . While Trump promised several times on the campaign trail that Trump had no interest in touching these popular programs , Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has been making noise that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan wants to go after these policies . If Trump takes a stand right now , stating that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan will not support Speaker of the House Paul Ryan proposals , he Speaker of the House Paul Ryan win some Senate Democratic support for his Speaker of the House Paul Ryan appointments . But this would not be enough . He Speaker of the House Paul Ryan to show with his Speaker of the House Paul Ryan , and not just his Speaker of the House Paul Ryan , that he Speaker of the House Paul Ryan serious about making deals . The most important step that he Speaker of the House Paul Ryan take is to allow Democrats to present a new version of an infrastructure stimulus that would create jobs and boost spending for blue collar and middle class Americans .   Trump ’s current proposal does n’t please many Democrats since it Trump’s current proposal primarily provide tax relief to private contractors as a means of lowering the cost of financing the program , not offer public jobs to America ’s workers . Meanwhile , Senator Bernie Sanders , has offered a plan of his Senator Bernie Sanders , revolving around $ 1 trillion in direct spending on projects . Letting congressional Democrats do the initial drafting work on a bill , and then making a deal from within the framework that they congressional Democrats would be appealing , even for opponents who fundamentally do n’t trust him Senator Bernie Sanders The final step Trump could take to build some goodwill with Democrats would be to join the bipartisan drive to investigate whether Russia launched a cyberattack during the presidential election . Thus far , Trump Trump has been almost entirely defensive . He has Trump the intelligence agencies producing this data , and he has Trump himself from Trump like Senator John McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham who are demanding immediate and swift action .   But Trump can Trump reverse course , demonstrating to Democrats that he is Trump about protecting America ’s political institutions and throwing his support Trump the establishment of a select committee to investigate Russian interference . President Obama has now put new sanctions into place as a retaliation for Russia ’s actions . Rather than just saying it ’s time to " move on " from the hacking scandal , he can President Obama that he is President Obama about using sanctions     peace through strength     until there are assurances that Russia will Russia from engaging in these kinds of attacks again .   The odds of Trump doing any of these three options are low . From the moment he won President Obama general election , he has President Obama the Republican Party line     except on the issue of Russia . Russia has President Obama little to appeal to Democrats , and he has President Obama continued with the incendiary partisan rhetoric of the campaign .    But when it comes to Trump , Trump can never make assumptions . Perhaps in the lead up to the inauguration he will President Obama to show that some of the skills he is President Obama boasting about can actually be put into effect . That would be the biggest surprise of all .
