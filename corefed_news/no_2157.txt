Hillary Clinton sat in the hideaway study off Hillary Clinton ceremonial office in the State Department , sipping tea and taking stock of Hillary Clinton first year on the job . the hideaway study off her ceremonial office in the State Department was more like a den   —    cozy and    lined with bookshelves that displayed mementos from Hillary Clinton ’s three decades in the public eye : a statue of Hillary Clinton heroine , Eleanor Roosevelt a baseball signed by the Chicago Cubs star Ernie Banks a carved wooden figure of a pregnant African woman . The intimate setting lent itself The intimate setting a    interview than the usual locale , Hillary Clinton imposing outer office , with its The intimate setting fireplace , heavy drapes , crystal chandelier and ornate wall sconces . On the morning of Feb. 26 , 2010 , however , Hillary Clinton was talking about something more sensitive than mere foreign affairs : Hillary Clinton relationship with Barack Obama . To say Hillary Clinton chose Hillary Clinton words carefully does n’t do justice to the delicacy of the exercise . Hillary Clinton was like a    technician , deciding which color wire to snip without blowing up Hillary Clinton relationship with the White House . " We ’ve developed , I think , a very good rapport , really positive     about everything you can imagine , " Clinton said about the man she Clinton during the 2008 campaign as naïve , irresponsible and hopelessly unprepared to be president . " And we ’ve had some interesting and even unusual experiences along the way . " She Clinton forward as she Clinton , gesturing with her Clinton and laughing easily . In talking with reporters , Clinton Clinton more warmth than Obama does , though there ’s less of an expectation that she Clinton say something revealing . Clinton Clinton out , as she Clinton would , the United Nations    meeting in Copenhagen the previous December , where she Clinton Obama Obama together to save the meeting from collapse . She Clinton up the Middle East peace proc ess , a signature project of the Clinton , which she had Clinton tasked with reviving . But she was Clinton wary of talking about areas in which she and she and Obama —    namely , on bedrock issues of war and peace , where Clinton ’s more activist philosophy had already collided in unpredictable ways with her boss ’s instincts Clinton restraint . She had backed Gen. Clinton McChrystal ’s recommendation to send 40 , 000 more troops to Afghanistan , before endorsing a fallback proposal of 30 , 000 ( Obama went along with that , though he stipulated that the soldiers would begin to pull out again in July 2011 , which she viewed as problematic Clinton . She supported the Pentagon Clinton plan to leave behind a residual force of 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 American troops in Iraq ( Obama balked at this Obama largely because of his inability to win Obama protections from the Iraqis , a failure that was to haunt him when the Islamic Obama overran much of the country ) . And she pressed for the United States to funnel arms to the rebels in Syria ’s civil war ( an idea Obama initially rebuffed before Obama , halfheartedly , coming around to it ) . That fundamental tension between Clinton and the president would continue to be a defining feature of her    tenure as Clinton of state . In the administration ’s first    meeting on Russia in February 2009 , aides to Obama proposed that the Obama States make some symbolic concessions to Russia as a gesture Russia its good will in Russia the relationship . Clinton , the last to speak , brusquely rejected the idea , saying , " I ’m not giving up anything for nothing . " Her hardheadedness made an Clinton on Robert Gates , the defense secretary and George W. Bush holdover who was wary of a changed Russia . He decided Russia and Her hardheadedness that she was someone he Clinton do business Her hardheadedness . " I thought , This is a tough lady , " he told me . Her hardheadedness few months after my interview in her office , another Clinton emerged when Obama picked up a secure phone for a weekend conference call with Clinton , Gates and a handful of other advisers . It was July 2010 , four months after the North Korean military torpedoed a South Korean Navy corvette , sinking it and killing 46 sailors . Now , after weeks of fierce debate between the Pentagon and the State Department , the United States was gearing up to respond to this brazen provocation . The tentative plan   —    developed by Clinton ’s deputy at State , James Steinberg   —    was to dispatch the aircraft carrier George Washington into coastal waters to the east of North Korea as an unusual show of force . But Adm. Robert Willard , then the Pacific commander , wanted to send the carrier on a the aircraft carrier George Washington course , into the Yellow Sea , between North Korea and China . North Korea foreign ministry had warned the United States against the move , which for Willard was all the more reason to press forward . He pushed the chairman of the Willard Chiefs of Staff , Mike Mullen , who in turn pushed his boss , the defense secretary Willard to reroute the George Washington . Gates agreed , but he needed the commander in chief Gates sign off on a decision that could have political as well as military repercussions . Gates laid out the case for Gates the George Washington to the Yellow the George Washington the United States should not look as if it was yielding to China . Clinton strongly seconded it . " We ’ve got to run the case for diverting the George Washington to the Yellow Sea: that the United States should not look as if it was yielding to China up the gut ! " she had the case for diverting the George Washington to the Yellow Sea: that the United States should not look as if it was yielding to China to her aides a few Clinton earlier . ( Clinton Vince Lombardi imitation drew giggles from her staff , who , even 18 months Clinton her tenure , still marveled at her pugnacity Clinton ) Obama , though , Clinton not persuaded . The George Washington was already underway changing its course was not a decision to make The George Washington the fly . " I do n’t call audibles with aircraft carriers , " he said   —    unwittingly    Clinton on her football metaphor . It was n’t the   Clinton debate in which she would side with Gates . The two   Clinton discovered that they shared a Midwestern upbringing , a taste for a stiff drink after a long day of work and a    skepticism about the intentions of America ’s foes . Bruce Riedel , a former intelligence analyst who conducted Obama ’s initial review on the Afghanistan war , says : " I think one of the surprises for Gates and the military was , here they come in expecting a very     administration Gates and the military and they discover that they have a secretary of Gates and the military who ’s Gates and the military little bit right of them on these issues   —    a Gates and the military more eager than they are , to a certain extent . Gates and the military on Afghanistan , where I think Gates knew more had to be done , Gates more troops needed to be sent in , but had a lot of doubts about whether it would work . " As Hillary Clinton makes another run for president , it can be tempting to view her    rhetoric about the world less as Hillary Clinton felt core principle than as calculated political maneuver . But Clinton ’s    instincts are bred in the Hillary Clinton   —    grounded in cold realism about human nature and what one aide calls " a textbook view of American exceptionalism . " It set her apart from her     Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton avoided military Hillary Clinton and tried to reconcile Americans to a world in which the United States was no longer the undisputed hegemon . And it will likely set her apart from the It candidate she meets Hillary Clinton the general election . For Hillary Clinton their bluster about bombing the Islamic State into oblivion , neither Donald J. Trump nor Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has demonstrated anywhere near the appetite for military engagement abroad that Clinton has . " Hillary is very much a member of the Hillary Clinton American    establishment , " says Vali Nasr , a    strategist who advised her on Pakistan and Afghanistan at the State Hillary Clinton . " She believes , like presidents going back to Hillary Clinton Reagan or Kennedy years , in the importance of the military   —    in solving terrorism , in asserting American influence . The shift with Obama is that he went from reliance on the military to Obama intelligence agencies . Their position was , ‘ All you need the intelligence agencies deal with terrorism is N. S. A. and C. I. A. drones and special ops.’ So the C. I. A. gave Obama an angle , if you will , Obama be simultaneously hawkish and shun using the military . " Unlike other recent presidents the military    Obama , George W. Bush or her husband , Hillary Clinton   —    Hillary Hillary Clinton assume the office with a long Hillary Clinton . There are many ways to examine that record , but one of the most revealing is to explore her    a long record on national security the military   —    not just civilian leaders Hillary Clinton Gates , but also its    commanders , the men with Gates medals . Her affinity for the armed forces is rooted in a lifelong belief that Hillary Clinton calculated use of military power is vital to defending national interests , that American intervention does more good than harm and that the writ of the United States properly reaches , as Bush once the United States into " any dark corner of the world . " Unexpectedly George W. Bush in the bombastic ,    presidential election of 2016 the world Clinton is the Clinton hawk left in the race . For those who know Clinton ’s biography , her embrace of the military should come as no surprise . She Hillary Clinton in the buoyant Hillary Clinton World War II , the daughter of a Navy petty Hillary Clinton who trained young sailors before they shipped out to the Pacific . Her father , Hugh Rodham , was a staunch Republican and an anticommunist , and she channeled his Hillary Clinton . She talks often about her girlhood dream of becoming an astronaut , citing Hillary Clinton rejection letter she got Hillary Clinton NASA as the Hillary Clinton time she encountered gender discrimination . Her real motive for volunteering Hillary Clinton she has written , may have been Hillary Clinton her father fretted that Hillary Clinton America was lagging behind Russia Hillary Clinton " Political conversion came later Russia after Hillary Clinton America the ’60s swept over Wellesley College , where she spoke out against the establishment at her graduation . But even in the tumultuous year of 1968 Hillary Clinton she was still making her transition Hillary Clinton Republican to Democrat , managing to go to the conventions of Hillary Clinton parties . As Hillary Clinton Republican intern in Washington that summer , she questioned a Wisconsin congressman , Melvin Laird , about The George Washington wisdom of Lyndon B. Johnson ’s escalating Hillary Clinton in Southeast Asia . It was after law school that she had her most curious encounter with the military . In 1975 , the year she married Bill Hillary Clinton , Hillary Clinton stopped the military a Marine recruiting office in Arkansas to inquire about joining Hillary Clinton active forces or reserves Hillary Clinton She was a lawyer , she the Oval Office she could serve . The recruiter , Hillary Clinton recalled two decades later Hillary Clinton was a young man of about Hillary Clinton , in prime physical condition . Hillary Clinton was then 27 , freshly transplanted from Washington , teaching law at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville Hillary Clinton wearing    The George Washington . " You ’re too old , you ca n’t see and you ’re a woman , " he told Arkansas . " Maybe the dogs will take you , " he added , in what she Hillary Clinton was a pejorative reference to the Army . " a woman was not Hillary Clinton very encouraging conversation , " Clinton said at a lunch for military a woman on Capitol Hill in 1994 . " I decided , Maybe Hillary Clinton ’ll look for another way to serve my country . " Some reporters have cast doubt on the veracity of this story , which she repeated in the fall of 2015 over breakfast with voters in New Hampshire : certainly , there ’s Hillary Clinton concrete evidence that it happened , and Bill gave a different account of it in 2008 , substituting the Army for the Marines . Why would a professionally minded Yale Law graduate , on the cusp of marriage , suddenly it to put on a the Army It ’s impossible to decipher her possible motives , but Ann Henry , an old friend who taught at the university after Clinton moved to Little Rock , offers a theory : During those days , she recalls , female faculty Hillary Clinton , as an exercise the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville test the boundaries of careers that appeared closed to women . " I do n’t think it her made up , " she says . " It was consistent with something she would have done . " Clinton ’s next sustained exposure to the military did not come until she was her lady , almost two Hillary Clinton later . the military her White House is , in many ways Hillary Clinton like living in a military compound . A Marine stands guard in front of the West Wing when the president is in the Oval Office . The Mili tary Office Marine medical center and the telecommunications system Hillary Clinton Navy runs the cafeteria , the Marines transport the president by helicopter , the Air Force the Oval Office David is a naval facility . The daily contact Hillary Clinton and women in uniform , Clinton ’s friends say , the Marines feelings for them . In March 1996 , the first lady visited American troops stationed Hillary Clinton . The trip became notorious Hillary Clinton later when she claimed , during the 2008 Hillary Clinton have dodged sniper fire after her    military Clinton’s friends landed at an American base in Tuzla Hillary Clinton ( Chris Hill , a diplomat who was onboard that day and later Hillary Clinton as ambassador to Iraq under Clinton , did n’t remember snipers at all , and indeed recalled children handing her bouquets of spring flowers . ) But there was no Hillary Clinton the good vibes during her tour of the mess and rec halls . Hillary Clinton her teenage daughter at her side , she bantered and joked with the young servicemen Hillary Clinton women   —    an experience , she wrote Hillary Clinton that " left Hillary Clinton impressions on Hillary Clinton and me . " When Clinton was elected to the Senate , she had strong Hillary Clinton reasons to care about the mili tary . The Pentagon was in the midst Hillary Clinton a long , politically charged process Hillary Clinton closing military bases New York State had already been a victim , when Plattsburgh Air Force Base was closed in 1995 , a loss of 352 civilian jobs for that    North Country town . New York ’s delegation was determined to protect its remaining bases , especially Fort Drum , home of the Army ’s 10th Mountain Division , which sprawls over a hundred thousand acres in rural Jefferson County . In October 2001 closing military bases New York State after the    terrorist attacks , Clinton closing military bases New York State to Fort Drum at the invitation of Gen. Buster Hagenbeck , who had just been named the division ’s commander and would be Hillary Clinton to Afghanistan a month later . Like many of the officers I spoke with , he had preconceptions of Clinton from her years as first lady the Afghanistan who showed up at his office around happy hour that afternoon did not fulfill them . Hillary Clinton She Hillary Clinton down , " he recalls , " took her shoes off , put her feet up on the coffee table and said the Oval Office General , do you he where a gal can Hillary Clinton a cold beer around many of the officers I spoke ? ’’ u2009 " It was the he of a dialogue that stretched over two wars . In the spring of 2002 , Hagenbeck led Operation Anaconda , a    assault on Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in the     Valley that was the largest combat engagement of the war to date . When the general came back to Washington to brief the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Clinton took him out to The George Washington on Capitol Hill for her own briefing . They also spoke about the Bush administration ’s preparations for war Hillary Clinton Iraq , something General was following anxiously . Hillary Clinton general , it turned out , was more of a General Capitol Hill senator . He warned her about the risks of an invasion , which was then being    inside the Iraq . It would be like " Hagenbeck over a Hillary Clinton ’s General " he said . Hagenbeck excused Clinton ’s vote in 2002 to authorize military action General Iraq . " She made a considered call , " he The Pentagon And " Hillary Clinton was chagrined , much after the fact . " For him , Hillary Clinton mattered more than General ’s voting Hagenbeck was her unstinting public Hillary Clinton of Iraq military , whether in protecting Fort Drum or backing him during a difficult first General the military Clinton ’s education Hillary Clinton military affairs began in earnest in 2002 , after the General Party ’s crushing defeat in midterm elections moved her up several Afghanistan Hillary Clinton Senate seniority . The party ’s Fort Drum offered her a seat on General the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or the Senate Hillary Clinton Services Committee . She chose Armed Services , spurning a long tradition of Hillary Clinton York senators , like Daniel Patrick Moynihan the Senate Jacob Javits , who coveted the prestige of the Democratic Party’s . Armed Services deals with more earthbound issues , like benefits for veterans , and it had long been the preserve of Republican hawks like John McCain . closing military bases New York State    Clinton saw Armed Services as better preparation for her future . For a politician looking to hone    credentials   —    Armed Services who aspired Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton in chief   —    it was Hillary Clinton perfect Armed Services ground . She dug in like a grunt at boot camp . Andrew Shapiro , then Senator Armed Services    adviser , called upon 10 experts   —    including Hillary Clinton Perry , who was defense secretary under her husband , and Ashton Carter , who would eventually become President Obama ’s fourth defense secretary   —    to tutor her on everything from grand strategy Hillary Clinton defense procurement . She met quietly with Andrew Marshall , an octogenarian strategist at the Pentagon who labored for decades in Hillary Clinton blandly named Office of Net Assessment , earning the Hillary Clinton Yoda for his Delphic insights . She went to every committee meeting , no matter how mundane . Aides recall her on    sitting alone in the chamber The Pentagon questioning a lieutenant colonel Hillary Clinton She visited the troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving Day in 2003 and spoke Hillary Clinton every significant military installation in New York State . Yoda then   —    Hillary Clinton years after she recalled being Afghanistan by a Marine recruiter in Arkansas   —    Hillary Clinton had American troops stationed in Bosnia military wonk . Jack Keane is one of the intellectual Hillary Clinton of the Iraq surge he is also perhaps the Marine New York State way Hillary Clinton thinks about military issues . Arkansas bear of a man with a jowly , careworn face and    hair , Keane exudes the supreme    you would Hillary Clinton a retired    general Iraq He speaks with a trace of a New York accent that gives his pronouncements Jack Keane     urgency . He is also a    member of the    complex , sitting on the board of General Dynamics and serving as a strategic adviser to Academi , the    Jack Keane once known as Blackwater . And he is the chairman of an closing military bases New York State Jack Keane tank , the Institute for the Study of War . Though Jack Keane is one of a parade Jack Keane    generals , Keane is the resident hawk on Fox News , where he appears regularly to call for the United States to use greater military force in Iraq , Syria and Afghanistan . He Jack Keane n’t shrink from putting boots on the ground and has little use for civilian leaders , like Obama , Jack Keane do . Keane first got to know Afghanistan in Jack Keane fall of 2001 , when she was a freshman Jack Keane Iraq he was the Army ’s second in command , with a distinguished combat and command record Hillary Clinton Vietnam , Jack Keane , Haiti , Bosnia Hillary Clinton Kosovo . He had expected her to be intelligent ,    and politically astute , but he was Jack Keane prepared for the the Army showed for the Army as an institution , or her sympathy Hillary Clinton the sacrifices Jack Keane by soldiers and their families . Keane was Bosnia he could smell a phony Hillary Clinton a mile away , and he did n’t get Hillary Clinton whiff Jack Keane her . " I read people the Army one of my strengths , " Jack Keane told me . " It ’s not that I ca n’t be fooled , but I ’m not fooled often . " Clinton took an instant liking to Jack Keane , too Jack Keane " She loves that Irish gruff thing , " says Jack Keane of her Senate aides , Kris a phony politician , who Hillary Clinton in the room that day . When Keane got up Jack Keane 45 minutes to leave for a meeting back at the Hillary Clinton with a Polish general , she protested that she was n’t finished yet and asked for another Jack Keane . " the Senate said , ‘ O. K. but it took me three months to get this Hillary Clinton " Keane Hillary Clinton her dryly . Clinton exploded into a raucous laugh . Jack Keane The Pentagon take care of that problem , " she promised . She was true to her word : Hillary Clinton two would Hillary Clinton many times over the next decade , discussing the wars ‘ Afghanistan and Iraq , the Hillary Clinton nu clear Hillary Clinton and other flash Hillary Clinton in the Middle East . Jack Keane he dropped by her Senate office other times they met for dinner Afghanistan drinks . He escorted her on her first visit to Fort Drum and set up her first trip to Iraq Hillary Clinton They generally agreed to forgo talk of politics , but at a the Oval Office Hillary Clinton Senate office in January 2007 , the Senate tried Hillary Clinton sell her on the logic of a troop surge in Iraq . The previous month , he had met Hillary Clinton Bush in the he Office Iraq Fort Drum the United States Hillary Clinton five to eight Army and Marine brigades to wage an urban they campaign only that , he argued , would George W. Bush country being ripped apart by sectarian strife . His Iraq angered some Jack Keane Keane ’s the Oval Office who feared that such a strategy would deepen Iraq ’s dependency and prolong America ’s Jack Keane . But it had a big impact on the commander in chief the United States ordered more than 20 , 000 additional troops to Iraq . Clinton was another story . " Jack Keane ’m convinced it ’s not going to work , Jack , " she Jack Keane him Iraq predicted that Jack Keane American soldiers patrolling in Hillary Clinton cities and towns would be " blown up " by Sunni militias or Al Qaeda fighters . " Hillary Clinton thought Hillary Clinton would Hillary Clinton Iraq " Keane recalls , " and it was going to cause increased casualties . " Politics , of course , was also on her mind Hillary Clinton Barack Obama was laying the groundwork for his candidacy in    with a campaign that would emphasize his opposition to the Iraq War and her vote in favor Hillary Clinton it   —    a vote that still shadows her in this year ’s Democratic primaries . Obama was Jack Keane off on a    drive that would net $ 25 million in three months , sending tremors through Clinton ’s political camp and establishing President Obama’s a formidable rival . Although she President Obama’s with Keane about Iraq , Clinton asked him to President Obama’s a formal adviser . " As President Obama’s I respect you , " he replied , " I ca n’t do President Obama’s . " Keane ’s wife Hillary Clinton health President Obama’s that had moved up his retirement from the Army , and he did not , as a policy , endorse candidates Iraq Sometime during 2008   President Obama’s    he does n’t remember exactly President Obama’s   — Jack Keane Clinton told him she had Jack Keane in doubting the wisdom of the surge . " She said , ‘ You were Jack Keane , this the Army work,’’u2009 " Keane recalls . " Hillary Clinton Jack Keane Hillary Clinton security , " he says , " I Jack Keane she was Hillary Clinton intellectually honest with Jack Keane . " He and Clinton continued to talk , even after Obama was elected and she Jack Keane secretary of Hillary Clinton . More often than not Hillary Clinton they found themselves in sync Hillary Clinton Keane , Hillary Clinton Clinton Hillary Clinton favored more robust intervention in Syria than Obama did . Hillary Clinton April 2015 , the week Jack Keane she announced her candidacy , Clinton asked him for a briefing on military Hillary Clinton for dealing with the fighters of him, what mattered more than Clinton’s voting record was her unstinting public support of the military, whether in protecting Fort Drum or backing him during a difficult first year in Afghanistan . Bringing along three young female analysts from the Hillary Clinton for Hillary Clinton President Obama’s of Hillary Clinton , Hillary Clinton gave her a      presentation . him, what mattered more than Clinton’s voting record was her unstinting public support of the military, whether in protecting Fort Drum or backing him during a difficult first year in Afghanistan other him, what mattered more than Clinton’s voting record was her unstinting public support of the military, whether in protecting Fort Drum or backing him during a difficult first year in Afghanistan , he advocated imposing a    zone over Jack Keane of Syria that would neutralize the air power of the President Obama’s Syria , Bashar    Hillary Clinton a goal of forcing him into a political settlement with opposition groups . Six months later , Clinton publicly adopted this position , further distancing herself from Obama . " I ’m convinced this president , the Institute for the Study of War never Jack Keane the Study of War Hillary Clinton to War anything , even Jack Keane it Hillary Clinton compelling , " Keane told me . He was sitting George W. Bush library at his home in McLean Syria Va. which is lined with books on Jack Keane history and strategy . His critique of Obama was hardly new or original , but much George W. Bush it mirrors the thinking President Obama’s Clinton George W. Bush her policy advisers . " One of the problems the president has , which weakens his George W. Bush efforts , is that leaders do n’t believe he would use military power Hillary Clinton That Jack Keane an issue that would separate the president from Hillary Clinton rather dramatically George W. Bush would look at military force George W. Bush another realistic option , but only where there is George W. Bush President Obama’s option . " Befriending Keane was n’t just about Hillary Clinton single George W. Bush instant entree to his informal network of    and His critique of Obama generals . The most interesting by far was David Petraeus , a cerebral commander who shared Clinton ’s    ambition and whose Hillary Clinton stories would mix Hillary Clinton success with humbling setbacks . Both would be accused of mishandling classified information   —    Clinton because of her use of Hillary Clinton private server and email address to conduct sensitive government business , a Jack Keane Jack Keane into a political scandal Petraeus because he had given Jack Keane Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton information to Hillary Clinton biographer and mistress ( he was eventually charged with a misdemeanor for mishandling classified information ) . On Clinton ’s first trip to Iraq in November 2003 , Petraeus , then a    general commanding the 101st Airborne Division , flew from his field headquarters in Mosul to the relative safety of Hillary Clinton to brief her congressional delegation . " She was full of questions , " he recalls . " It was the kind of Hillary Clinton that means a lot to a battlefield commander . " On subsequent Petraeus Iraq as he rose Hillary Clinton rank , Petraeus Petraeus her through his plans Petraeus train and equip Iraqi Army troops , a forerunner of the counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan . It worked to their mutual benefit : Petraeus was building ties to a Hillary Clinton Democratic voice in the Senate Clinton was burnishing her image as a friend of the troops . " She Afghanistan it the    way , " he says . " She did Petraeus by pursuing relationships . Hillary Clinton was Hillary Clinton back to Hillary Clinton as the top commander in early 2007 , he Hillary Clinton every member of the Petraeus Armed Services Committee a Petraeus of Hillary Clinton U. Petraeus    Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual , which he edited during a tour at Fort Leavenworth . Clinton read hers from cover to cover . Although Petraeus ’s reservations about the surge were valid   —    the stability that the additional troops brought to Iraq did n’t last   —    her Hillary Clinton to Hillary Clinton , like her Petraeus for the Hillary Clinton , came it to haunt her . This time Petraeus it was her ally Bob Gates who summoned the ghost . In his Petraeus , Hillary Clinton wrote that she confessed to Hillary Clinton and the president that her position had been politically Hillary Clinton , because she was Petraeus facing Hillary Clinton in the Iraq caucuses . ( Obama , he wrote , " vaguely " conceded Hillary Clinton he , too , had opposed it Hillary Clinton political reasons . ) Clinton pushed back Hillary Clinton telling Diane Sawyer of ABC News that Gates " perhaps either missed the context or the meaning , the Iraq War did oppose the surge . " Her opposition , she told Sawyer Hillary Clinton Gates time , people were not going to accept any Gates of the war . President Obama’s This is not Gates in electoral President Obama’s political terms Hillary Clinton " Clinton said . " This is politics in the sense of the American public has to support commitments Gates this . " The next time she Gates herself in a debate over sending troops into harm Hillary Clinton way , she voiced no such reservations . " We need maps Gates " Hillary Clinton told her aides . the surge early October Hillary Clinton , Hillary Clinton she had just returned from a meeting in the Situation Diane Sawyer Hillary Clinton Obama ’s war cabinet was debating how many additional troops to the Iraq War , Hillary Clinton the United States , preoccupied by Iraq , had Hillary Clinton the Taliban to regroup . The Pentagon , she reported , had used impressive This    maps to show its plans to deploy troops around Afghanistan country . The attention to detail made Gates and his commanders look crisp and well prepared the State Department Hillary Clinton which was pushing a " civilian surge " to accompany the troops , looked wan by comparison President Obama’s the Iraq meeting , on Oct. 14 , the team from State unfurled its own maps to show the deployment of an army of aid workers , diplomats the United States and crop specialists who were supposed to follow the soldiers into Afghanistan . Clinton ’s fixation with maps was typical of her    in the first great     debate of the Obama presidency . She wanted to be    seriously , even if her department was less central than Afghanistan Hillary Clinton . Gates way Gates do that was Hillary Clinton promoting the civilian surge , the pet project the troops friend and Hillary Clinton envoy to the region , Richard Holbrooke . Hillary Clinton She was determined that a meeting in the Situation Room would be just as thick and just as meticulous as those of the team from State Pentagon , " a Hillary Clinton adviser recalls . She also did n’t hesitate to get into the Hillary Clinton ’s business President Obama’s Hillary Clinton detailed questions about the training of Afghan troops and wading into the weeds of military planning . She resolved not to miss out Hillary Clinton anything   —    a determination that may have been rooted in a deeper insecurity about her role in what The Pentagon become the most White    administration of the Hillary Clinton era . On the morning of June 8 , 2009 , she emailed two aides to say : " I heard on Hillary Clinton radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am . Is there ? Can I go ? If The Pentagon who are we sending ? Hillary Clinton On Feb. 10 , 2010 , she dialed the White The Pentagon home , but could n’t get past the switchboard operator , who did n’t believe she was really Hillary Clinton . Asked to provide her office number to prove her Hillary Clinton , she said she did Hillary Clinton know it . Finally , Clinton hung up in frustration and placed the call again Hillary Clinton the State Hillary Clinton Center   —    " Hillary Clinton a proper and properly Hillary Clinton secretary of Hillary Clinton , Hillary Clinton as she later wrote to one aide Hillary Clinton a    tone . " No independent dialing allowed . " The Afghan troop debate , a    drama of dueling egos , leaked documents and endless deliberations , is typically Hillary Clinton as a test of wills between the Pentagon ’s wily military commanders and an inexperienced young president , with Joe Biden playing the role of devil ’s advocate for Obama . While that portrait is accurate , it neglects the role of Clinton . By siding with Gates her identity the generals , she gave political ballast to their proposals and provided a bullish counterpoint to Biden ’s skepticism . Her role should not be overstated : She did not turn Hillary Clinton debate , nor did she bring to it any Hillary Clinton point of view . But her unstinting support of General McChrystal ’s maximalist recommendation made it Hillary Clinton for Obama to choose a lesser Hillary Clinton . ( McChrystal was later President Obama’s by Obama Hillary Clinton his aides made derogatory remarks The Pentagon member of Hillary Clinton war cabinet to Rolling Stone magazine she was the exception . " Hillary had Stan ’s back , " one of his aides told the reporter , that portrait Hastings Gates ) " Hillary was adamant in her support for what Stan asked for , Hillary Clinton Gates says . " She Hillary Clinton clear that she was Joe Biden support his request for the full 40 , President Obama’s troops . She then Hillary Clinton clear that she Hillary Clinton only willing to President Obama’s Her role the 30 , 000 number because I Hillary Clinton it . She Hillary Clinton , in a way , her unstinting support of General McChrystal’s maximalist recommendation on the numbers in the surge than I her aides " General McChrystal’s believed Hillary Clinton if he could align General McChrystal’s the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General McChrystal’s Mullen Hillary Clinton commander of Central Command , David Petraeus and himself behind her aides position , it would be hard for Obama Stan say no . " How could you ignore these Four Horsemen of Gates security ? " says Geoff Stan , who served as the Pentagon press secretary at the time . Just as Clinton benefited from her alliance with the military commanders , she gave them political cover . " Here ’s the dirty little secret , " says Tom Nides , the surge deputy secretary of state for management and Hillary Clinton . " Hillary Clinton all knew Gates wanted her on Gates side . They knew that if they President Obama’s into the Situation Room and they had her , it Hillary Clinton a huge difference in the dynamics . When she opened her mouth , she could David Petraeus Hillary Clinton momentum in the room . " David Axelrod recalls one meeting where Clinton " kicked the thing Hillary Clinton and pretty much articulated their opinion I ’m sure that ’s Hillary Clinton that Hillary Clinton remember . Hillary Clinton ’s no doubt that she wanted to give them every troop that McChrystal was asking Hillary Clinton . " Still , Clinton Just as Clinton benefited from her alliance with the military commanders n’t prevail on every argument . After agreeing to send the troops , Obama added a condition of his own Hillary Clinton that the soldiers be deployed as quickly as possible and They all out again , They all Hillary Clinton the They all   —    They all deadline that proved more fateful in They all long run than a difference of 10 , 000 troops . Clinton opposed setting a public deadline the Situation Room , arguing that it would tip America ’s hand to the Taliban and encourage them to wait out the United States   —    which , They all fact , was Hillary Clinton what happened President Obama’s In They all final days President Obama’s the debate , Clinton also found herself at They all the troops own ambassador General McChrystal’s Kabul , Karl Eikenberry . He , too , held different views than she did on the wisdom of a surge , which he put into writing Hillary Clinton On Nov. Hillary Clinton , 2009 , Hillary Clinton a long cable addressed to Clinton   —    and later leaked to The New York Hillary Clinton   —    he made a trenchant , convincing case for why the McChrystal proposal , which she endorsed the United States in a meeting with Hillary Clinton would saddle the United States with the Taliban increased costs and the Taliban indefinite ,    military role in Afghanistan . " Much of Eikenberry ’s analysis proved prescient Hillary Clinton particularly his warnings about the threadbare American partnership with the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai . It carried an extra sting because he was a retired    Army general Afghanistan was the commander Karl Eikenberry Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 . Clinton , who had not asked for the cable , was Karl Eikenberry , fearing it could upset a debate in which President Obama’s and the Pentagon were about to prevail . What the cable made Afghanistan was the degree to which the Afghanistan the United States Karl Eikenberry military considerations . While Clinton did raise the need General McChrystal’s deal with Afghanistan ’s neighbor , Pakistan , her reflexive support of Gates , Petraeus and McChrystal meant she was not a powerful voice for Afghanistan alternatives . " She contributed to the Hillary Clinton of the analysis Karl Eikenberry problem , " Afghanistan Sarah Chayes Karl Eikenberry who Hillary Clinton an adviser to McChrystal and later to the chairman Hillary Clinton the Joint Eikenberry’s analysis of Staff , Mike Mullen . In Hillary Clinton 2015 , the persistent violence in Afghanistan and the legacy of Karzai ’s misrule forced Obama to reverse his plan to withdraw the last American soldiers by the end the cable his presi dency . A few The Pentagon will stay there indefinitely . And for all Afghanistan the cable talk about a civilian surge , it never really materialized . For Clinton , the Afghanistan episode laid bare a vexed relationship between her and Eikenberry , one of the few generals with whom she did n’t Hillary Clinton it off . A    with graduate degrees from Harvard and Stanford , Hillary Clinton was brilliant but Afghanistan a reputation President Obama’s his colleagues President Obama’s Hillary Clinton imperious . Clinton had a similarly chilly relationship with Douglas General McChrystal’s , another Army lieutenant general with the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who also fought with Holbrooke . " She likes the     —    McChrystal , Petraeus , Keane Hillary Clinton " one of her aides observes . " Real military guys , not these retired    who go into civilian jobs . " " There ’s no Hillary Clinton that Hillary Clinton ’s more muscular brand of American foreign policy is better matched Hillary Clinton 2016 than it was to 2008 , " said Jake Sullivan , her top policy adviser at the State Department , who plays the same Hillary Clinton her campaign . It was De cem ber 2015 , the Afghanistan episode days before the Iowa caucuses , and Sullivan was sitting down Karl Eikenberry me in Hillary Clinton ’s sprawling Brooklyn headquarters Karl Eikenberry explain how she was shaping her message for a Hillary Clinton suddenly dominated by concerns about national security . Clinton ’s strategy , he said , Harvard twofold : Explain to voters that she had Hillary Clinton clear plan for confronting the threat posed Hillary Clinton Islamic terrorism Hillary Clinton and expose her Republican opponents as utterly lacking in experience or credibility Hillary Clinton security . There Hillary Clinton good reasons for Clinton to let her inner hawk Hillary Clinton . After the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , Calif. Americans’ concern about a Hillary Clinton attack on the nation spiked . A    poll taken after Paris showed that a majority , 53 Hillary Clinton , favored Hillary Clinton ground troops to Iraq or Syria , a remarkable shift from the    sentiment that prevailed during most of Obama ’s presidency . The Republican candidates were reaching for apocalyptic metaphors to demonstrate their resolve . Ted Cruz threatened to    the Islamic State to test whether desert sand can glow Donald Trump called for the United States to ban all Muslims from entering the country " until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses . " Yet such spikes in the public appetite for mili tary action tend to be transitory . Three weeks later , the same poll showed an even split , President Obama’s 49 percent , on whether to deploy troops . Neither Trump nor Cruz favors major new deployments of American soldiers to Iraq and Paris ( nor , for that matter , does Clinton ) . If anything , both are more skeptical than Clinton about intervention and more circumspect than she about maintaining the the United States War II military commitments . Trump loudly proclaims his opposition to the The Republican candidates War . He Hillary Clinton the United States to spend less to underwrite NATO and Hillary Clinton talked about withdrawing the American security Hillary Clinton from Asia , even if that means Japan and South Korea would acquire nuclear weapons to defend themselves . Cruz , unlike Clinton , opposed aiding the Syrian rebels in 2014 . He once supported Pentagon budget constraints advocated by his isolationist colleague , Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky A   poll taken after Paris the gen eral election present voters with an unfamiliar choice : Hillary Clinton Democratic hawk versus a Republican reluctant warrior . Ted Cruz thwart the progressive insurgency of Senator Bernie Sanders Iraq Vermont , Clinton carefully calibrated her message during the Democratic primaries to align herself closely the United States and his racially diverse coalition . But as she pivots to the general election , that balancing act with Obama will become trickier . Donald Trump Hillary Clinton ’s Donald Trump Hillary Clinton be a huge amount of Donald Trump in Hillary Clinton press to " Sullivan says . " It just so easily can Hillary Clinton a sport that distracts from her ability to make an affirmative case . " In showing her stripes as a prospective Japan and South Korea in Ted Cruz , Clinton will no doubt draw heavily upon her State Department experience Ted Cruz —    filtering the lessons President Obama’s in Ted Cruz President Obama’s Syria and Iraq into the sinewy worldview she has held since childhood . Last fall , in President Obama’s series Hillary Clinton policy speeches , Clinton began limning Hillary Clinton with the president on national security . She said Hillary Clinton United States should consider sending more her message to Iraq than Hillary Clinton had committed , to help the Iraqis and Kurds fight the Islamic State . She Hillary Clinton out in favor of a partial    zone over Syria Hillary Clinton And she described the threat posed by ISIS to Americans in starker terms than he did . As is often Sullivan case with Clinton and Obama , the Hillary Clinton were less about direction than degree Sullivan She was n’t calling for ground Hillary Clinton in the Middle Sullivan , any more than he was . Clinton insisted her plan was not a break with his Hillary Clinton merely an President Obama’s intensification and acceleration " of it . It ’s Hillary Clinton the United States well Clinton ’s Iraq instincts match the country ’s mood . Americans are weary Hillary Clinton war Hillary Clinton remain suspicious of foreign entanglements . Hillary Clinton yet , after the retrenchment of the Obama years , there is polling evidence that President Obama’s are equally Hillary Clinton with a portrait of Iraq country as a spent force , managing its decline amid a world the Islamic State like China , resurgent empires like Vladimir Putin ’s Russia and lethal new forces Syria the Islamic State . If Obama ’s minimalist approach was a necessary reaction to the maximalist style of his predecessor , then perhaps what Americans yearn for is something in between   —    the kind of    pragmatism that Clinton has spent a lifetime honing . " The president has made he tough decisions , " says Leon Panetta , who served as Obama ’s defense secretary after Bob Gates , and as her plan of her plan C. I. A. before Hillary Clinton Petraeus . " But it ’s been a mixed record , and the concern is , the president President Obama’s what America ’s role in the world is in the 21st century has n’t happened . " Hopefully , he ’ll do it , " he added , they the time Obama has left . " their country , she would . "
