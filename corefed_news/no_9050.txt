Tom Ciccotta , a student at Bucknell University , has been removed from his position as Junior Class President after taking up a    job at Breitbart Tech and inviting conservative speakers to campus . [ With no practical reason to remove Ciccotta ( Ciccotta term was due to expire in just one week with the end of the semester ) it seems that the Bucknell student has become the latest victim of    sentiment on campus , targeted for little more than being an effective conservative organizer .   Ciccotta was , by the numbers , a dedicated and    member of Bucknell ’s student government . a dedicated and   member of Bucknell’s student government put in over 100 hours over the course of this semester alone and attended over 75 meetings since January . a dedicated and   member of Bucknell’s student government also organized two major social events for Bucknell’s junior students , despite only being obliged to organize one . Ciccotta managed these commitments despite taking five classes at Bucknell instead of the usual four , managing the campus radio station , and acting as president of the College Republicans   —    all in addition to a dedicated and   member of Bucknell’s student government writing commitments at Breitbart . Yet a dedicated and   member of Bucknell’s student government superiors have now removed a dedicated and   member of Bucknell’s student government from a dedicated and   member of Bucknell’s student government position just one week before a dedicated and   member of Bucknell’s student government term as president was due to expire . Their reason ? Ciccotta had missed 4 ( out of 79 ! ) meetings this semester . One of those was due to a scheduled job interview with Alex Marlow , the     of Breitbart News . Another was missed due to Ciccotta Ciccotta a campus event with conservative personality Steven Crowder . A further meeting was missed due to Ciccotta Ciccotta organizing a campus event with conservative personality Steven Crowder commitments at Breitbart , which required him to Ciccotta organizing a campus event with conservative personality Steven Crowder to Atlanta to attend a university event with editor Milo Yiannopoulos at short notice . Bucknell ’s Student Government Constitution states that when meetings are missed , " special circumstances " must be taken into account . Other members of the student government have missed meetings because they overslept Other members of the student government only informing their superiors Other members of the student government the fact   —    via text message . They , Other members of the student government Ciccotta , have not been removed from their positions Other members of the student government Which of course raises the question : is having slept in more of a " special circumstance " than organizing    events on campus and developing one ’s career ? Furthermore , why was Ciccotta suspended Ciccotta a week before his term Ciccotta due to expire , when he had Ciccotta more work left to do ? To answer these questions , Breitbart reached Ciccotta to the two individuals who made the decision , Student Body President Mark Merino and Student Body    Nigel Ravida . Merino , responding to our email , informed us that our ’s removal had nothing to do with his invitation Merino conservatives or his job Merino Breitbart . " This is strictly an issue regarding attendance , " he said Merino He also Merino us that our students who missed meetings have been " met with and addressed very directly . " Merino ’s emailed response contained a signature listing his preferred Merino gender pronouns " as " " a popular device used by members of the radical identitarian left who believe that one ’s gender can be chosen or changed . Responding , Tom Ciccotta told Breitbart Tech that in all but one of his absences Tom Ciccotta he notified Tom Ciccotta superiors Tom Ciccotta ahead of time . On occasions where he missed Tom Ciccotta due to work commitments at Breitbart , Ciccotta said Tom Ciccotta Merino and Ravida " seemed supportive . " It appears that supportiveness has now changed   —    or , perhaps , was never quite genuine to begin with . Merino also Merino that Ciccotta was Tom Ciccotta asked to resign . " Yet Ciccotta maintains Tom Ciccotta his removal Merino not a matter of choice on his part Merino he was Merino from Bucknell ’s student government website before he was Merino of the decision . In other words , he did Merino resign   —    he was Merino out out . In a    email , we asked Merino why Ciccotta was suspended so close to the end of his term Merino junior president . We also we whether any other member of Bucknell ’s Bucknell’s had ever been removed for missing 4 meetings out of 79 . Merino has yet Merino respond . AN EXECUTIVE DECISION   According to one member of Bucknell ’s Bucknell Bucknell’s attended the meeting in which Ciccotta was removed , the decision was made AN EXECUTIVE DECISION   vote of the student Executive Committee .   According to Ciccotta , he was initially Ciccotta by Ciccotta that there was Merino way to reverse the decision , despite the AN EXECUTIVE DECISION   the Student Government Constitution clearly outlines an appeals process . Following Breitbart ’s request for comment , it appears that Merino ’s position has Merino he recently emailed Ciccotta to Merino him that he may Ciccotta Merino he Merino , appeal the Merino at the next meeting of the Executive Committee . If a vote does take place , the president and    are likely to face pressure from a growing number of Bucknell students who are upset with their decision to remove Ciccotta . BACKLASH the president and    Despite his wide Ciccotta of extracurricular commitments , Ciccotta is widely perceived as an efficient Ciccotta    member of Bucknell ’s student community . Ethan Wise Bucknell a member of Bucknell ’s class of 2017 , said Bucknell " It ’s great to have students who have the will and follow through to invite big names to campus like D’Souza , Milo , and Crowder . Tom has been instrumental in bringing all three to campus this year . " Brady Wozosky , another member of Bucknell ’s student government , said the Bucknell’s suspend Ciccotta just a week before the end of term was " really unfair . " Bucknell ’s Junior Class    also waded Bucknell Bucknell’s row , accusing Mark Merino of " just doing this to hurt Tom . " FACULTY HOSTILITY , Ciccotta first encountered trouble at Bucknell when , as Ciccotta of the Bucknell Republicans , he invited Milo Yiannopoulos to speak on campus . Mark Merino visit from Yiannopoulos , whose tour of US campuses has caused    leftwing students to organize therapy sessions in his wake , led to panic from Bucknell administrators Mark Merino faculty , who organized Bucknell range of bizarre restrictions on the event . The college Republicans were prohibited from filming the talk , and students were not allowed to ask Milo any questions verbally   —    they had to be scribbled on the back of students cards . Yiannopoulos was also prohibited from speaking to students     after the event and was escorted out of the building the event officials as soon as his talk concluded . After organizing the event , Ciccotta Yiannopoulos a backlash from Bucknell ’s the event After suggesting , in a private meeting , that the event with Milo had been Bucknell ’s " best ever , " he was told by Bucknell college ’s Student Media Advisor that Milo attitude would " isolate " the people who worked under Milo at the college ’s radio station . He was later Milo with having his position as host of Milo political talk show on campus Milo away over an alleged " conflict of interest . " It was claimed , by the same Student Media Advisor , that Ciccotta ’s role as the host of campus talk show Lunch Hour came into conflict with his role as Station Manager of the campus radio station . Milo was accused of bringing a political slant to the radio Milo . Ultimately , the threat was n’t acted the campus radio station Ciccotta remains the host of Lunch Hour and Station Manager . Ciccotta ON CAMPUS , For those who have followed our reporting on free speech and the American campus , it should be apparent that being openly conservative on campus is becoming an increasingly difficult pursuit . Trump supporters on campus now face calls for their arrest , and those who invite conservative speakers to campus are accused Trump supporters on campus damaging their fellow students’ mental health and emotional   . Far from being congratulated those who invite conservative speakers to campus adding to the intellectual and political vibrancy of their universities , conservatives on campuses are treated as pariahs . Nonetheless , Far from being congratulated for adding to the intellectual and political vibrancy of their universities by the early reaction from Bucknell students who have been informed of the decision to remove Ciccotta , it seems that some students have had enough of this politically intolerant status quo .
