Fox News Channel host Greg Gutfeld argued that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s change in position on visas is " a record   " that met " the definition of establishment " on Friday ’s broadcast of " The Five . "   Fox News Channel host Greg Gutfeld began , " For so long , most of the media has let Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump hit from the ladies’ tee , until last night , when this lady , teed one up , on him Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump " After playing a clip of Trump Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that he Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump changed his Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on visas for    workers in response to a question from moderator Megyn Kelly , Gutfeld remarked , " So he Gutfeld changed . I like that . Good for him Gutfeld I applaud him Gutfeld admitting this , and Megyn as well for asking that important question . But it is weird . Days ago he Gutfeld American workers replaced at Disney . Then last night defended the use of foreign tech workers . That ’s got to be a record   . Now the definition of establishment is one who seeks power , and does anything to hold on to it the definition of establishment meaning say anything to get elected , then abandon those promises . We just saw that from the man who condemns it in others . ‘ They ’re taking our We is now , we We to have talented people in this country . I absolutely agree , but I wonder how others feel . Has anyone checked in on David Duke ? But we We change our We , and at least he David Duke it before the election , not after . The question is , would he David Duke told us We we We n’t ask ? Last night we We a little more about a potential president . And that is , we We very little at all . It ’s all in his David Duke , and it It subject to change , based on what ? Does anyone know ? Does he David Duke know ? " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
