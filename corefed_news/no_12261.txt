House Speaker Paul Ryan wants more immigrant laborers to milk cows in Wisconsin , even though Wisconsin farmers are already hiring U. S.   robots to get the job done . [ The    came late in a recent interview with the The Atlantic ’s Ron Brownstein , when House Speaker Paul Ryan called for more migrants to milk Wisconsin cows .   What I ’ve always believed is that you need to retool the legal system so that the legal system fits the economy ’s needs    …      transition our legal [ immigration ] system so that visas are given to what are needed for the economy . Do we have a shortage of dairy workers in western Wisconsin ? Yes , we we .   But in his own part of Wisconsin Wisconsin at least 40 farms have solved the labor problem by hiring robots to milk their at least 40 farms .   Back in 2013 , Ryan was also complaining about the a lack of dairy workers in Wisconsin Wisconsin   As Ryan Ryan the National Journal in 2013 : " [   immigrants ] bring labor to our economy so jobs can get done . The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin Wisconsin having a hard time finding anyone to help them The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin their The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin , which are mostly cheese . If they The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin n’t find workers , then they The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin n’t produce , and we ’ll end up importing . Ryan even converted his Ryan argument about a labor shortage into an argument for cheap labor forever instead of    productivity boosting machinery . The flip side of the argument is : Just raise wages enough to attract people . But you raise wages too much in certain industries , then you ’ll get rid of those certain industries and we ’ll just have to import . "    machines are used at up to 70 percent of farms in some parts of Europe   —    but are only used in a few percent of U. S. farms , said Justin Segner , a    salesman for a European    Lely . " This is in its infancy This the United States , " he said Justin Segner, a   salesman for a European   Lely partly because the federal government imposes stringent    regulations on the    machines , and also because federal policy favors the use of migrant laborers , he said Justin Segner, a   salesman for a European   Lely Segner told Breitbart News that he ’s Justin Segner, a   salesman for a European   Lely " huge fan " of Paul Ryan , adding he plans Justin Segner, a   salesman for a European   Lely invite Ryan to Paul Ryan the    machines in operation . Lely ’s    machines are assembled by American workers in Pella , Iowa . Ryan ’s Paul Ryan that there is a shortage of    tech workers is a favorite talking point amongst business interests and Silicon Valley executives , who stand to profit from an influx of    foreign workers . However , it is a talking point that tech labor market experts have thoroughly debunked . U. S. Census data shows there are more than 11 million Americans with degrees with Science , Technology   Engineering and Math ( STEM ) who lack e employment in these fields . In fact , U. S. schools are graduating two times more students with STEM degrees than are annually finding employment in their professions U. S. schools That sympathy for employers’ demand for cheap labor is part of Ryan ’s    libertarian worldview . For decades , he ’s Ryan other GOP leaders have believed that companies should be able to hire foreign workers when they ’re companies pleased with supply of American workers . This " any willing worker " view would condemn Americans and their grandchildren Americans an economy where salaries ca n’t rise above the poverty wages that are acceptable to the next African or Asian willing to fly into the country . Ryan also justifies his support Ryan migration by saying migrants are needed to fund retirement for a growing number of retired Americans : Boomers are retiring , we ’re going to need medical professions . We ’re we to need nurses and doctors    …      even if we get everybody off of welfare into work    …      we ’re still going to have population needs because of demographics in this country . [ We ’re facing ] a 90 percent increase in the retirement population but only a 19 percent increase in the [ working ] population . So we are We to need people , we are We to need legal immigrants . That means in my mind , visas ought to be given based upon your contribution to society , your skill set that is needed in our economy We can not , is not being filled by Americans . Ryan ’s focus on migrants is misguided , says Steve Camarota , the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies . Even the current flood of immigrants is making make very little difference to the number of workers , and the migrants nudge up the birth rate by only about 4 percent , he said Ryan Moreover , immigrants get older , they retire immigrants they consume immigrants huge amount of taxpayers funds that could otherwise preserve Americans’ retirement programs , he said Ryan " The thing about immigrants is that they tend immigrants be much poorer than natives    …      you ca n’t pay for the retirement programs with a lot of immigrants who consume a lot of entitlement programs , such as welfare , " he said Ryan Moreover , there ’s no shortage of    Americans , Camarota said . " America ’s problem is that we do n’t have enough people of working age   —    our problem we that so many people of working age do n’t work . " The better fix , he said Camarota is to increase the productivity of working Americans via better education , business practices and technology . " Productivity is obviously the ultimate solution " to the retirement problem , he said Camarota   In fact , Segner told Breitbart News that older farmers in Wisconsin are postponing their retirement older farmers in Wisconsin their robots older farmers in Wisconsin taking over the    task of milking the cows , two or three times a day , 365 days a year . The fixation on cheap imported labor that is shared by Ryan and the    wing of the GOP explains why Donald Trump won the 2016 nominee . Trump got Donald Trump nomination because because he says Donald Trump immigration system should be tuned to help Americans before it help the immigration system executives , Wall Street stockholders , or foreigners . That ’s the fundamental difference why Ryan ’s allies   —    Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker , Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio   —    were cheerfully kicked to the curb during the 2016 GOP primary by Trump ’s supporters . In a recent Arizona speech , Trump promised Trump’s enact " new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first , " and to keep " immigration levels , measured by population share , within historical norms . " In the    debate , Gov. Mike Pence said the immigration issue " really does begin with us reforming our immigration us and putting the interests , particularly the safety and security of the American people , first . " Ryan is gradually learning from Trump ’s success .   In his interview Ryan Ryan , Ryan insisted that polls show that most GOP supporters support amnesty , and then suggested Ryan should Ryan GOP legislators GOP award " legal status " to the 11      illegal immigrants in the United States . But Ryan actually Ryan away Brownstein ’s Brownstein " You ’ve got to start with security , " Ryan replied Ryan The problem so many people have is there ’s no faith or confidence we ’ll actually secure our borders , that will actually have interior security , so the feeling is that we will do something our the legal side [ to help business ] but we wo n’t secure our border and that our ’ll have the our problem 10 years down the road . Brownstein pressed for a " package "    bill that is favored by his advertisers , by Brownstein groups and by Democrats , but Ryan did n’t budge .   What I do n’t think works is a big comprehensive bill . Those always collapse under their own weight . Those think it ’s the wrong way to go . I think you stage reforms and   they must begin with reforms and      exercise that is critical for national security   …        —    [ s0 ] secure the border , [ do ] interior reinforcement   …      In the day and age of heroin coming into our high schools and ISIS trying to penetrate southern border , you have got to deal with this    …      if we deal with that in a way that gives people the sense that we are actually securing we country this country I think attitudes will change across the country where people then are willing to embrace fixing our broken immigration system . That new emphasis on proven border security before eventual amnesty is a big change for Ryan . For decades , Ryan ’s sided with business Ryan which have worked with Democratic legislators to flood the country the country of millions of        immigrants . Ryan did nothing Ryan those migrants pushed up to seven million    and      American men out of the job market   —    but now he ’s reacting Ryan seeing how GOP voters repaid the favor by GOP his    GOP Ryan out of GOP primary race . But Ryan still has Ryan accepted the reality that his party ’s Ryan base   —    plus many independents and Democrats   —    really do n’t want to be treated just as replaceable workers in an    world economy . Each year , 4 million Americans turn 18 years old and begin entering the workforce . But , each year , the federal the federal government 2 million foreign workers   —    legal immigrants ,    refugees and asylum seekers and illegal immigrants   —    to compete for jobs against Americans .   The inflow of professionals and    workers drives down the salaries of American    and    workers while boosting income for investors and employers . The inflow also crowds the schools used by the children of    Americans , sharply increases tax transfers from Americans to immigrants , reduces innovation and productivity , pushes many    Americans out of the workforce , and enables    violence by the workforce against Americans who do not live in protected neighborhoods . Polls show that Americans do n’t want to compete for jobs against    immigrants , illegal or legal , and they do n’t want to see their children forced Americans don’t want to compete for jobs against   immigrants, illegal or legal    jobs alongside clannish groups Americans don’t want to compete for jobs against   immigrants, illegal or legal    migrants . Americans want to be nice to immigrants   —    but almost 90 percent says companies should hire Americans before importing more workers .
