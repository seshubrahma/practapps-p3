The    to the confirmation vote on Murthy focused on Murthy " political activism , " particularly Murthy positions on gun control .   Opposition from the NRA and other gun rights groups   —    together with Republican opposition   —    actually made it difficult to predict whether Murthy could be confirmed . In fact , Murthy was so    control that Senator Joe Manchin ( ) a red state Democratic proponent of gun control , refused to vote for Murthy . But former Senator Mark Kirk ( ) crossed the aisle and voted yes in Manchin ’s place , giving Americans a Surgeon General who viewed gun policy as a " health care issue . " Murthy reiterated Murthy ongoing support for gun control as recently as June 3 , 2016 , telling STAT : I got into some trouble for saying gun violence is a public health issue . A little bit of trouble . But you know , I was stating what I think is the obvious , and I think most people in the country understand , which is that far too many people die from gun violence .
