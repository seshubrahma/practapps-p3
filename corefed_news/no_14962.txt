  ( CNN ) As usual , Donald Trump is completely upside down on the facts .        In 2015 , President Barack Obama created the Clean Power Plan to slow climate disruption . It was the first action ever taken by the US government to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants .   And this week , with the stroke of a pen , Donald Trump directed the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to take steps to end it the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)     Trump Donald Trump have just signed a death warrant for our planet ( at least , for a planet that is liveable for humans ) . And the lies he Donald Trump to justify it have real consequences for real Americans , here and now .   First , Trump Donald Trump he Donald Trump to dismantle the Clean Power Plan because it the Clean Power Plan what he Donald Trump "   regulation . " False     limited losses in some sectors are dwarfed by gains in others .   The potential for job growth in the clean energy sector dwarfs any potential job growth in the fossil fuel economy . For example , Trump Donald Trump the Keystone XL pipeline would create 28 , 000 jobs when he Donald Trump the project . But he Donald Trump to use a huge multiplier to get to even that low number . In fact , it would create about 3 , 000 temporary construction jobs and only 35 permanent jobs . That ’s right : 35 permanent jobs . Exxon to Trump Donald Trump Do n’t ditch Paris climate change deal , By comparison , in 2016 the number of jobs in solar grew 25 % from the year prior , according to figures from the nonprofit Solar Foundation , while jobs in the rest of the economy had less than 2 % growth .   Renewable energy jobs now create jobs 12 times faster than the the rest of the economy   For the economy ignore this fact is inexcusable and irresponsible . He ’s actually hurting the people Trump claims to help by refusing Trump invest in opportunities for more jobs in the booming clean energy sector . By the way , if Trump really cares about those coal Trump he invited to   the signing Trump , he should be doing something about Trump 20 , 000 who are sick , retired , and within weeks of losing their health benefits if Congress does those coal miners he invited to  the signing ceremony act . When will Trump call a press conference about Trump ? Second , Trump claims those coal miners he invited to  the signing ceremony the Clean Power Trump was an EPA overreach     an abuse of its authority . Again , false Trump The plan is based on Republican the Clean Power Plan Nixon ’s Clean Air Act . And the EPA ’s authority to fight climate EPA EPA a ruling of conservative Chief Justice John Roberts’ Supreme Court , under President George W. Bush . In Massachusetts v. EPA ( 2007 ) five justices determined that EPA not only has the authority but also the EPA to cut pollution if it endangers public health     which it does .   Curbing carbon pollution     and it America ’s land , water and people from other potentially lethal threats     is neither a liberal value nor a conservative value . Protecting Americans from climate chaos is in everyone ’s interest . Third , Trump says eliminating environmental regulations will make America great again . Remember when we had burning America ? That was n’t so great .   If we follow the Trump trajectory , we ’re going we be bringing Trump back to American cities , accelerating asthma rates in children , putting more poison in the groundwater and costing a lot of Americans their lives . Trump wants to focus on " children regulations . Trump We should be equally concerned about potentially     . Government must balance the interests of people ’s ability to earn a living . .. against their ability to actually live . Trump seems to have completely forgotten this . For Trump , Kamita Gray in Brandywine , Maryland is living on the frontlines of Brandywine worst pollution in America . Brandywine is in Prince George ’s county , which has a population that is 65 % African American . This community has three power plants in its backyard already . Two more are being developed . The This community quality is so bad there that when the wind blows , people do not leave their homes .    It will be communities like Brandywine that people left to deal with the brunt of fossil fuel pollution from power plants in their neighborhoods . If Trump wants to make America great again the brunt of fossil fuel pollution he needs to remember that Brandywine is a part of America Trump too .
