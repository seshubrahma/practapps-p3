  ( CNN ) The Messy Truth , a special program hosted by Van Jones , airs Tuesday at 9 p. m. EST . I got tired of just sitting on the CNN set , talking about Donald Trump voters . So , days before the 2016 election , I decided to fly into a battleground state     and talk to Donald Trump voters . I visited Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , where a major battle was fought in America ’s Civil War . I wanted to know one thing : Are we on the verge of another civil war ? What I learned surprised me . The answers are even more important , now that Trump has won . My film crew recorded our Gettysburg encounters in hopes My film crew ’d shed light on this tense moment in America .   FIRST EPISODE , A local family invited me into A local family home one day after Trump made Trump own " Gettysburg Address " at a campaign appearance .   I expected fireworks . And I got A local family . What I did n’t expect was all the laughter     or the tears . SECOND EPISODE , Four moms sat on the front porch and debated Trump candidacy . Even though they Four moms bitterly , I discovered their Four moms for remaining the best of friends . THIRD EPISODE , I encountered my toughest challenge : a young Trump supporter who would n’t back down . Finding common ground seemed impossible . Then a tiny miracle happened . What these conversations reinforced in my mind is the basic decency and dignity of the Trump voters . They these conversations not blind to his Trump’s candidacy . They these conversations rank and balance his Trump’s candidacy differently than do his Trump’s candidacy . That ’s important for Trump ’s critics to know and understand . I left wanting to cultivate a deeper sense of empathy     in myself and in our country . That ’s what we seem to be missing     and secretly longing for . To be clear : This increase in empathy will not decrease our we . After all , constructive disagreement and democratic debate is the basis of all progress . Democracies advance themselves Democracies the creative use of our disagreements . But more empathy and understanding can keep us our needlessly inflaming one another , and this should create the conditions for a better understanding of our differences . Deeper insight can only help all sides . Therefore , I am inviting everyone who watches this series to have a # MessyTruth conversation . Talk ( and listen ) to someone with whom you do n’t agree . Ask questions about anything that does n’t sound right to you . But do n’t just fight back . Try to listen . In fact , before you respond at all , carefully repeat back what you hear     just to make sure you truly understand the other person . Then share your own views and feelings . Be passionate . But be compassionate , too . Whatever you discover in the process , consider sharing it the process the hashtag : # MessyTruth . Democracy does n’t just happen on Election Day at the polls . Democracy happens every day , through every interaction we have with each other . Our we depends on our we to have these kinds of conversations all across the country . You may be surprised by what you uncover . There are hypocrisies , blind spots and surprising areas of agreement everywhere . Because the real truth is always a little messy .
