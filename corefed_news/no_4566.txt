Neal Katyal made oral arguments for maintaining the injunction against President Donald Trump ’s executive order banning migrants from certain    countries Monday before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . [ " Neal Katyal could say , like President Bush did right after September 11th , ‘ The face of Terror is not the true face of Islam , that ’s not what Islam is about , Islam is Peace.’ Instead , we get ‘ Islam hates us’ , " Katyal told the bench , answering    Judge Richard Paez ’s question on what , if anything , Trump could do to make the executive order acceptable .   Katyal , former President Barack Obama ’s    acting Solicitor General , has taken on the representation of the plaintiffs who stopped the executive order ’s implementation in March when a federal court in Hawaii ruled in their favor a federal court in Hawaii The Justice Department has appealed the case to the Ninth Circuit , seeking to vacate that injunction . The most controversial element of    district court Judge Derrick Watson ’s ruling was its justification   district court Judge Derrick Watson’s ruling the injunction based not on the text or effect of the executive order , but on statements President Trump made during the 2016 campaign . According to that ruling   district court Judge Derrick Watson’s ruling about a " Muslim ban " and speaking negatively about the religion ’s relationship with the West mean that the plaintiffs had a high enough likelihood of proving a violation of the First Amendment ’s Establishment Clause to block the order . the Executive Order true even though the actual order does the Executive Order action based on people being Muslim because , " [ A ] reasonable , objective observer —   enlightened by the specific historical context , contemporaneous public statements , and specific sequence of events leading to its issuance —   would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion[. ] " Katyal doubled down on this line of argument Monday , contending , as the district court had , that no reasonable objective observer could not see that the purpose of the order was to disfavor Muslims the Executive Order evidence , he rattled off an extensive list of argument briefs submitted in favor of striking down Trump ’s order . Mentioned were the usual bevy of      and liberal religious groups . " Even the Cato Institute , " Katyal finished , referring to the libertarian think tank with a long history of supporting weak immigration laws . The argumentation led naturally to the question of what , if anything , could be done to save such a facially neutral order . " Does that mean that the President is forever barred from issuing an executive order along these lines ? " Judge Paez asked Katyal . " What does he have Katyal do to issue an Judge Paez order that , in your view , might pass constitutional muster ? " Trump might gain more power to issue executive order if he " disavows , " Katyal argued Trump " One example would Katyal what Judge Hawkins said about disavowing formally the stuff before . " " But that ’s not it , he could do a lot the stuff things Judge Hawkins " Katyal continued . " I ’m just Katyal to throw out some examples , I ’m not trying to micromanage the president ’m " In addition to suggesting Trump could save his order by telling the country " the president is peace , " Katyal also recommended removing references , in Katyal text of the order , to the unsavory elements of Islamic society . " It could eliminate the text which refers to honor killings , " he told the court . Katyal , the president his work at the Katyal Department during the president Obama administration , frequentally defended presidential power to govern by executive order . He appeared to recognize the unusual nature the president this suit challenging a president ’s authority on religious grounds . " Our fundamental point to you is that Presidents generally do n’t run into establishment clause problems . This is a very unusual case in which you have these public statements by the President , " he said .
