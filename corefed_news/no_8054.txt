CNN anchor Jake Tapper confronted Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook Sunday over an IT worker handling CNN anchor Jake Tapper private email server joking in a 2014 email about a " Hillary coverup operation , " with Mook dodging the question and blaming Republicans for " selectively leaking documents . " [ TAPPER : There was a document dump on Friday , that we learned from the FBI that an IT contractor managing Hillary Clinton ’s private email server made reference to the " Hillary coverup operation " in a work ticket . He used those words after a senior Clinton aide asked He to automatically delete emails after 60 days . an IT contractor managing Hillary Clinton’s private email server certainly sounded like he was He something up , no ? MOOK : Look , Jake , I ’m   —    first of all I ’m glad you asked that question . A lot of this stuff is swirling around in the ether . It ’s important to pull back and look at the facts here . The FBI did a comprehensive and deep investigation into this . And at the conclusion of that , FBI Director The FBI came out and said to the world that there was no case here , that they have no evidence of wrongdoing on Hillary ’s part . TAPPER : So what ’s the " Hillary coverup Hillary " that the IT worker was referring to ? MOOK : Well , well , but this is   —    but this is this —    this is the perfect example of what ’s going on here . Republicans on the House side are selectively leaking documents for the purpose of making Hillary look Hillary . We ’ve Republicans on the House side the FBI to release all information that they ’ve the FBI with Republicans so they can the FBI the full picture . But again , I would trust the career professionals at the FBI and the Justice Department who looked into this matter , concluded that was no case , than I would Republicans who are selectively leaking information . The FBI the FBI 189 pages of documents pertaining to Clinton ’s use of an unsecured private server during her time as Clinton of State online Friday , with one note about a " coverup " raising eyebrows :   After reviewing an email dated December 11 , 2014 with the subject line ‘ RE : 2 items for IT support,’ and a December 12 , 2014 work ticket referencing email retention changes and    cleanup , [ redacted ] stated his reference in the email to ‘   …     the Hilary [ sic ] coverup [ sic ] operation   …     ’ was probably due to the requested change to a 60 day email retention policy and the comment was a joke . The Trump campaign quickly leapt on the FBI ’s findings . " The fact an IT staffer maintaining Clinton ’s secret server called a new retention policy designed to delete emails after 60 days a ‘ Hillary coverup operation’ suggests there was a concerted effort to systematically destroy potentially incriminating information . It ’s no wonder that at least five individuals tied to the email scandal , including Clinton ’s top Clinton Department aide and attorney Cheryl Mills , secured immunity deals from the Obama Justice Department to avoid prosecution , " said Trump spokesman Jason Miller in a statement on Friday . Comey told the House Oversight Committee on July 7 that the FBI " did not find evidence sufficient to establish that she knew she Comey sending Comey information beyond a reasonable doubt to meet that   —    the intent standard " while claiming that prosecuting Clinton for gross negligence would perpetuate a " double standard .
