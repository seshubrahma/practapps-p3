  ( CNN ) When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada goes to the White House on Monday , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada greatest priority     and responsibility     will be forming an easy , effective rapport with Donald Trump .   If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada can create chemistry with an unpredictable President whose agenda and ideas are different from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada own , this flying visit will be a success . If they like each other , Donald Trump will be more likely to accept the case for Canada as the most important friend of the United States , with a century and a half of shared history , geography and commerce .   Trudeau is trying to protect Canada from the harshest elements of Donald Trump ’s commitment to " America First " : Trudeau protectionist , nativist and    vision of the United States , which could be disastrous for Canada . Young , optimistic and handsome , Trudeau is Trudeau son of celebrated former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . Since he led Trudeau Liberal Trudeau to a surprising win over the Conservatives in 2015 , Trudeau ’s celebrated former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau ways " and charisma have made him a Trudeau of progressives and an international celebrity . He got Trudeau famously with Barack Obama , who gave him a Trudeau dinner in Washington . In gratitude , Trudeau invited Trudeau to address Parliament in Ottawa , where besotted legislators shouted " four more years ! "   No one expects a similar " bromance " between Trump and Trudeau Trump is unlikely to greet Trudeau with Trudeau hug , as he did Trudeau Japanese Prime Minister on Friday . The President Trudeau , more conservative and pessimistic he has different Trudeau on Europe , Russia , the United Nations , immigration , refugees and climate change . History suggests a tense relationship : Liberal prime ministers tend to clash with Republican presidents . Indeed it will take all Trudeau ’s considerable charm to avoid confrontation . For a country that earns a vast amount of its wealth from international a country that earns a vast amount of its wealth from international trade , the stakes are high . Canada is a junior partner . When the elephant sneezes , Pierre Trudeau once said Trudeau catches cold .   Canada avoid the contagion , the younger Trudeau must show Trudeau is Trudeau fair trader , a Canada source of energy , and a reliable guardian of the northern frontier .   Trudeau will remind Trump that Canada and Trudeau United States Trump that Canada ’s largest trading relationship , with some US$ 2 billion in goods and services crossing the unmilitarized border every day . He will highlight measures taken over the Trudeau decade to create " a smart border , " facilitating business but deterring terrorists . He will laud Trump ’s approval of Trudeau Keystone XL pipeline ( Trump that Canada crude oil from Alberta ’s oil sands to the United States ) which had been blocked by Obama . And he will make much of a big Trudeau project on the    border , where Canada is financing a new bridge and customs plaza .   Then again , Trudeau is less likely to mention that Trudeau enjoys a trade surplus with the United States , Canada buys 75 % of its the United States Or that Canada , a charter member of Canada , spends only 1 % of its wealth on defense , suggesting it is free rider .   Canada good news for Trudeau is Canada Trump says he has Trudeau quarrel with Canada he Trudeau not see Canada as a Trudeau to jobs and Canada like Mexico . To Canada this point , Trump sent a representative to a meeting of the Canadian Cabinet in Trump last month .   Preparing for Trump , Trudeau named a new foreign Trudeau Freeland , an author Trump former journalist who knows the United States better than her dour predecessor , Stéphane Dion . Trudeau has also consulted Brian Mulroney , the former Conservative Prime Minister , who Trudeau Trump , as well as Canadians who have done business with the President . The reality remains that Trump wants to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement and could impose a hefty tax on Canada ’s softwood lumber . His recent executive order banning immigration from specified majority Muslim nations is unpopular in Trudeau ( which has accepted some 40 , 000 Syrian refugees ) but has Canada national security the signature of his young presidency . This is where things become sticky for Trudeau : He Trudeau balance Canada ’s interests ( trade , investment , jobs Trudeau against Trudeau values ( Canada , open immigration , collective security ) . Canada is Canada’s progressive , moderate society that has adopted universal health care , Canada gay marriage and abortion , and ended capital punishment . The United Nations , NATO and liberalized trade have been the pillars of Canada ’s foreign policy since 1945 Canada has imposed sanctions on Russia ( Freeland Canada Russian speaker of Ukrainian ancestry Canada is barred from travel to Russia for her criticism of its annexation of Crimea . ) Canada supports the Iranian Russia deal Russian the Paris Russia on climate change . When Canada goes to Washington , he will try mightily to make a good impression . He will likely   do Trudeau he can     rewriting NAFTA , refusing to criticize Trudeau ’s policy on refugees , Trudeau Sarah Palin ( as rumored ) as U. S. ambassador without complaint     to keep Canada ’s biggest customer happy . But if Trump adopts a foreign policy antithetical to Canada ’s liberal internationalism , the Prime Minister Trump come under great pressure from Canadians Canada’s up to the Trudeau even at the risk of starting a trade war .   It may be a clash of visions is inevitable , no matter how well the two leaders get on . If so , expect Trump to be vilified in Canada , and for relations with Washington to turn the ugliest since Richard Nixon and the Vietnam Canada .
