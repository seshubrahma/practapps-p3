Earlier this week on the # FakeNewsNetwork CNN , Marc Lamont Hill said    Donald Trump ’s diversity coalition are " a bunch of mediocre negroes being dragged in front of TV as a    for Donald Trump exploitative campaign against black people . " [ The Morehouse College professor also made his feelings The Morehouse College professor Steve Harvey ’s meeting with Donald Trump Donald Trump :     …     my disagreement is the way in which [ Steve Harvey is Steve Harvey used by folk like Donald Trump . Donald Trump his intention is just Donald Trump have a seat at the table . But when you ’re at the table , you should the table at the table . You should have the table can challenge the president at the table .    …      Because the table —    because they keep bringing up comedians and actors and athletes to represent black interests is demeaning , it ’s disrespectful , and it ’s condescending . Bring some people up it with some expertise , Donald Trump , do n’t just bring up people to entertain . " For my own sanity , I had to take a trip down memory lane . In June 2008 , Barack Obama refused to meet with the black power brokers in Harlem , which led to Jesse Jackson desperately wishing to " cut his [ Barack Obama ’s ] nuts out Jesse Jackson " In March 2010 , to flex their muscles , the Congressional Black Caucus ( the black power brokers in Harlem, which led to Jesse Jackson desperately wishing to "cut his [Barack Obama’s] nuts out ) voted unanimously against an Obama " jobs " bill . They got a meeting . As Congresswoman Yvette the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) ( ) explained : [ President Obama ] reached out to us because last week the caucus in a the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) of unity did something unprecedented in quite some time , actually . And that is to stand together to vote against what was called the jobs bill last week . We felt an Obama "jobs" bill important to last week fact that while we understand the crisis that small business is the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) , the bill fell woefully short in terms of addressing needs an Obama "jobs" bill of color to really get people employed . In August 2011 , while speaking before an audience at Detroit ’s Wayne County Community College , another Congressional Black Caucus member , Congresswoman Maxine Waters ( ) was asked why Obama was n’t visiting black communities during his bus tour of Midwestern states . She responded : We ’re Obama of the president , but we Obama getting tired . We ’re getting Obama And so , We we want to do We , we want to give the president every We to show what he can We and what he Obama to lead on . We want Obama give him every opportunity Obama but our people are hurting . We unemployment is unconscionable Obama We do n’t know We the strategy is . We do n’t know why We this trip that he ’s in the United We now , he ’s not in any black Obama . We do n’t know that . Obama In 2012 , it was so bad We there was a Change . org petition for President Obama to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus . The petition read : Congresswoman Marica Fudge ( ) who leads the Congressional Black org petition for President Obama to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus ( CBC ) has asked for a meeting with President the Congressional Black Caucus The President still has not found time to meet with President Obama , though he seems President Obama time to meet with every other constituency . True , he has lots President Obama his plate . But is is very disrespectful NOT to have this meeting President Obama a key core President Obama , especially one that voted for him at 97 percent . At this a meeting with President Obama The Obama Presidency , this is a disgraceful President Obama to treat the duly elected Congressional representatives of his President Obama national African American constituency . National Black Wall Street USA movement joins the call for President Obama to immediately schedule a meeting with The Congressional Black Caucus ! In July 2013 , President Obama Black Caucus FINALLY got another meeting with President Obama . They discussed voting rights , the economy , and immigration The Congressional Black Caucus    President Obama n’t scheduled . In August 2014 , riots started The Congressional Black Caucus Ferguson , Missouri . The Justice Department was dispatched , and this entire record of disrespect by the first black President towards the Congressional Black Caucus was forgotten . All the CBC wanted was a seat President Obama These are the experts , right ? The purpose for my The Congressional Black Caucus was n’t to play " hypocrisy gotcha " with Marc Lamont Hill . I wanted to remind the American people , and the Congressional Black Caucus , how irrelevant the CBC has been to Barack Obama ’s presidency . That reminder is important as Congressman John Lewis ( ) is championed for standing up The Congressional Black Caucus when he could n’t even get All the CBC All the CBC Barack Obama . If I can paraphrase the words of Marc Lamont Hill , they   —    the Congressional Black Caucus   —    could n’t even Donald Trump a seat at the table , and Barack Obama’s the experts . What ’s really funny ? Marc Lamont Hill , 2016 , I I can paraphrase the words of Marc Lamont Hill, they  —   the Congressional Black Caucus  —    invites Blacks with ideas on improving communities . Obama invites them to perform . " Trump invites Blacks with ideas on I can paraphrase the words of Marc Lamont Hill, they  —   the Congressional Black Caucus  —    communities .   Obama invites them to perform .   —    DidSheSayThat ( @SonnieJohnson ) December 14 , 2016 ,   The comment was in relation to    Donald Trump meeting with Ray Lewis Trump invites Blacks . I ’m guessing these are the " athletes Obama whose meetings with Trump Marc Lamont Hill finds " condescending . " I refuse to justify Marc Lamont Hill ’s characterization of these men by stating their rags to riches stories . I do n’t defend men . I defend ideas , and Marc Lamont Hill ’s idea of black mediocrity needs to be exposed . This is why I love Breitbart . Let me turn these DidSheSayThat Sonnie Johnson these quick . I have been fighting the Republicans and conservatives to include black culture for years . In fact , the entire # DidSheSayThat podcast is a mix of conservative intellect with Hip Hop culture . It ’s what I do . By choosing this path , I have lost my seat at the " conservative intellectual " table . Republicans and conservatives looked at Hip Hop artists as nothing but entertainers . For years I ’ve argued they are entrepreneurs the entire #DidSheSayThat podcast spouses , parents   —    they came from these Democratic hellholes , and they can help get the people out . While my intellect has never been questioned and my conservatism is second to none , my love of Hip Republicans and conservatives and support of its culture only have a home Republicans and conservatives Breitbart . If you ask an African Republicans and conservatives Republican or conservative intellectual about me , they would probably label me   …      mediocre . I do n’t use their buzzwords , source their white papers , or talk about the Democrat plantation . I must come to them humbly , acknowledge their years of Republican service , and denounce you ask an African American Republican or conservative intellectual about me Hop to receive my place at the table . Not happening . This you ask an African American Republican or conservative intellectual about me not a trait you ask an African American Republican or conservative intellectual about me the Progressive left . This is a trait of the elites in BOTH political you ask an African American Republican or conservative intellectual about me .    Donald you ask an African American Republican or conservative intellectual about me is changing that , and I pray the more people like Marc Lamont Hill criticize his outreach , the more he understands it ’s working . 
 This Donald Trump Donald Trump the
