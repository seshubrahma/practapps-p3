Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) insists that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are not keeping record border detention numbers secret ahead of the 2016 U. S. presidential election however , the Border Patrol agents who went on record making the claim are defiantly doubling down and directly accusing the agency of " cooking the books " to help Hillary Clinton win . [ A recent Breitbart Texas exclusive gave voice to two Border Patrol agents’ concerns that    leadership within CBP were hiding record border detainee numbers prior to the 2016 election . CBP ’s public information office fired back via email to this reporter and insisted that the numbers were " less than half of what the numbers were in 2014 . "   The matter becomes complicated due to the history of CBP insisting that Border Patrol agents with the National Border Patrol Council ( NBPC ) are lying , only for time to reveal that Border Patrol agents with the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) were telling the truth . In other words , CBP has a history of lying to the public and attacking both Border Patrol agents and reporters for telling the truth , only to be later forced to admit they were Border Patrol agents with the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) . Border Patrol Agent Brandon Judd , President of the NBPC , spoke again with Breitbart Texas and reminded this reporter of the history of " CBP lies . " He stated Breitbart " Look Darby , this is the same agency that publicly called you a liar on social media . They said one of your previous reports based on our words They erroneous . We were They proven to be correct . CBP is CBP again . They are CBP the fact that we have They numbers in Border Patrol custody in the Rio Grande Valley Sector ( RGV ) . This only serves to help Hillary Clinton by diminishing the reality on the border . They are CBP the books . " Agent Judd is indeed correct that CBP used CBP to attack this reporter , only to later delete the tweet and admit that my information was correct . In defense of the media workers for CBP , CBP often the media workers for CBP not realize that they are the media workers for CBP made to lie for their agency the media workers for CBP officials . The same held true when this reporter this reporter report from the agents in the NBPC about the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) allowing illegal aliens to fly on commercial aircraft without proper photo identification . In that case , the TSA spokesman sent the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) tweets out on Twitter to discredit me and insist that the Border Patrol agents were lying . TSA later admitted the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) a letter response to a Texas House Rep that the report had , in fact , been true . Again , the agents from the Border Patrol agents , were called liars by a federal agency , the agency attacked this reporter , and a federal agency information in my report turned out to be true the report federal agency was lying . Agent Judd also a federal agency own Congressional testimony from this year when he informed the Agent Judd Committee that CBP was approximately 50 percent Agent Judd in apprehending those who crossed the border illegally between ports of entry . " CBP publicly refuted those numbers saying that Border Patrol was 80 CBP effective and Commissioner Kerlikowski , in testimony given before the House Appropriations Committee , when asked about my testimony , said the NBPC is n’t always the best source . " Agent Judd continued , " The Commissioner was later challenged to provide specific examples and he Commissioner Kerlikowski he misspoke . Both the Associated Press and Fox Agent Judd reported that Agent Judd had seen an official report by CBP showing that the Border the Associated Press and Fox News is 54 percent effective at apprehending those who cross the border illegally . CBP has yet to release this report to the public . " CBP again , the agents an official report by CBP showing that the Border Patrol is 54 percent effective at apprehending those who cross the border illegally NBPC were correct and it appears managers within CBP were caught lying . Breitbart Texas is currently the agents in the NBPC official documentation provided CBP other Border Patrol agents that indicate the concerns over CBP " cooking books " and manipulating data are more widespread within the CBP . Brandon Darby is managing director and     of Breitbart Texas CBP "cooking books" him on Twitter and Facebook .
