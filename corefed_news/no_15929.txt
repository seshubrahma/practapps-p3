  ( CNN ) Deadly heat waves are going to be a much bigger problem in the coming decades , becoming more frequent and occurring over a much greater portion of the planet because of climate change , according to a study published Monday in Nature Climate Change . Extreme heat waves , such as the one torching the Southwestern United States and the one plaguing Western Europe , which has sparked wildfires in Portugal that have killed more than 60 people , are frequently cited as one of the most direct effects of    climate change . a study published Monday in Nature Climate Change says , by the year 2100 , three out of four people on Earth could be subject to at least 20 days per year of heat and humidity associated with deadly heat waves , if greenhouse emissions continue to rise at their three out of four people on Earth rates . Currently , that number is about one in three people . Even if humans aggressively cut back on fossil fuel emissions , such as outlined in the the Paris Agreement rising temperatures and humidity levels will combine to increase the intensity and frequency of deadly heat waves , the study said . President Donald Trump recently announced he would be pulling President Donald Trump United States out of the Paris Agreement .   " Our attitude towards the environment has been so reckless that we are running out Our good choices for the future , " said Camilo Mora , associate professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and lead author of the study .    the study heat waves , our options are now between Our or terrible , " Mora said . " Many people around the world are already paying the ultimate price of heat waves , and while models suggest that this is likely to continue to be bad , it could be much worse if emissions are not considerably reduced . " Determining what makes a heat wave deadly , Heat waves are notoriously deadly , as the human body can only function in a narrow range of body temperatures around 98 . 6 degrees Fahrenheit ( 37 degrees Celsius ) .   An international team of researchers , led by Mora and the University of Hawaii at Manoa , analyzed hundreds of historic heat waves to quantify what weather conditions posed the greatest risk of death in humans .   Using data from 783 lethal heat waves in 164 cities and across 36 countries , the researchers discovered a common An international team of researchers, led by Mora and the University of Hawaii at Manoa the heat wave becomes deadly .    " This threshold now allows us to a common threshold where the heat wave becomes deadly that are harmful to people . And because it is based on documented cases of real people across the globe , it makes it that much more credible it relevant it The scary thing is how common those deadly conditions are already . " Not surprisingly , the threshold is driven not only by a common threshold where the heat wave becomes deadly temperature , but also the relative humidity .   Sweating , the body ’s main process to remove heat by evaporative cooling ( think the process that makes your body cold after you get out of the shower ) becomes much less effective as relative humidity increases , because the air is already more saturated with moisture .    The team was able to use this threshold to distinguish between deadly and    heat waves in the historical record , and then use the same threshold to observe how these conditions will play out in the future using climate models run with different greenhouse gas emission scenarios . Future of deadly heat , The study allows us to peer into the future for any location on Earth and see how many days per year , on average , that location will cross the potentially deadly threshold any location on Earth has identified .   A web application was also developed so you can view any location under any of the potential emission scenarios .   For example , New York City , which now sees about two days per year that cross the threshold , rises to about 50 days per year by 2100 . The results paint a grim picture , where entire summers exceed the threshold in warmer and more humid cities like Orlando and Houston . Currently , about 30 % of the world ’s population ( and about 13 % of the land area ) experiences at least 20 days per year on which the deadly threshold is reached . By 2100 , this percentage jumps to 74 % of the population ( 47 % of the land area ) if emissions continue unchecked . the land area now on emissions could help , though only slightly . " If we do the best that we can , which is the Paris Agreement , you are we going to have nearly 50 % of the human population impacted , which is pretty bad , " Mora said . " But if we do n’t do anything , we are going to have [ more than ] 70 % we the population affected by these heat waves , which is terrible , " said Mora . " Unfortunately there is n’t much we can do Mora make the situation better , " Mora said while speaking of the Paris Agreement . But by Mora nothing , " We the Paris Agreement it a lot worse . "   Greatest risk in the tropics   While    locations will warm more than the tropics under global warming , this study indicates that a greater threat to life will be in the more humid , tropical locales .    According to the study , because areas in the tropics " have       warm this study higher humidity , " they require " less warming to cross the deadly threshold . " In the areas in the tropics "have higher   warm temperatures and higher humidity tropics , such as in Jakarta , Indonesia , the entire year is pegged to be above the potentially deadly level . Unfortunately , many of these parts of the world are less able to adapt to worsening heat waves as well , with limited access to air conditioning and unreliable electrical grids .    Dr. Marshall Shepherd , director of the University of Georgia ’s Atmospheric Sciences Program Shepherd Study after study finds discernible fingerprints of climate change in contemporary heat waves , " Shepherd said . " Most people know that summer the study also the most uncomfortable in terms of heat and humidity . Basic physics relationships explain why a warmer climate will likely mean more oppressive heat indices and    health issues . " Shepherd also said that we often overlook the impact that cities have on the intensity of heat waves , through the " urban heat island effect . " " Shepherd have overlooked that some of the most dangerous warming is associated with increasingly intense heat waves plus urban heat , " Shepherd said . " Globally , more people live in cities and that trend will continue . "
