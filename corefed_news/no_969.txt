WASHINGTON   —    Making the rounds at the Capitol on a recent evening , Mick Mulvaney , President Trump ’s budget director , decided to add an unscheduled stop : a meeting of the House Freedom Caucus , the group of    conservatives that once counted Mr. Mulvaney as a founding member . This history , it seems , does not afford lifetime privileges . After addressing the room briefly , amid the group ’s push to oppose the Republican health care bill endorsed by Mr. Trump , Mr. Mulvaney was interrupted , respectfully , by the Mick " Mark said , ‘ Look , Mick , we ’re going Mick ask you to step out because we know your loyalties are different now than they were,’ " we Mr. Mulvaney , a South Carolina congressman from 2011 until his Mr. Mulvaney last month . " And I said , ‘ Mark , you ’re absolutely right . ’ " He Mr. Mulvaney Mick complaint . As Mr. Trump unveils his budget plans this week   —    against the backdrop Mr. Trump a health care bill that Mr. Mulvaney ’s former colleagues detest   —    the man charged with executing the White House ’s fiscal vision is a figure who , not very long ago , might well have been leading the opposition to much of it . While Mr. Mulvaney ’s first budget does call for the White House’s fiscal vision of the Mr. Mulvaney to domestic programs in decades , in many ways his fiscal philosophy appears at odds with that of the president . Mr. Mulvaney Mulvaney has long railed against runaway military spending Mr. Trump wants Mr. Mulvaney increase . He has favored drastic changes to Medicare and lifting the eligibility age for Mr. Mulvaney Security , placing him at odds with Mr. Trump , who has pledged to protect those Mr. Mulvaney programs . And as administration officials and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill strain to muscle the health care bill through the House , Mr. Mulvaney has been placed in the unusual position of selling his former comrades on its merits . " He ’s a very worthy Mr. Mulvaney , let ’s put it that way Mr. Mulvaney " Mr. Meadows said . " You Mr. Mulvaney be a worthy adversary and not be an enemy . " Before being asked to leave the meeting , Mr. Mulvaney did persuade the group to hold a future gathering at a Mr. Mulvaney address : the White House bowling alley , for a night of pizza and health care policy . Those who knew Mr. Mulvaney before he was the nation ’s budget guru say that such gestures Mr. Mulvaney of a Mr. Mulvaney whose    leanings in Congress belied a collegial style . " He had a great sense of humor that could take you by surprise , " Mr. Mulvaney Carolyn Tillman , who was a classmate of Mr. Mulvaney ’s at Charlotte Catholic High School in North Carolina . " He was Mr. Mulvaney interested in other people ’s opinions . " But even then Mr. Mr. Mulvaney ’s ambition was apparent . He edited the school newspaper , served as student Mr. Mulvaney acted in theater performances and served Mr. Mulvaney president of the science club . He was also on the wrestling and golf teams and was a manager for the varsity basketball team Mr. Mulvaney After graduating from Georgetown University , Mr. Mulvaney went on to become a lawyer and then worked in the real estate and restaurant industries Mr. Mulvaney into South Carolina politics . By then a father of triplets , he was elected in 2006 to the State House of Representatives , where he gained a reputation as a Mr. Mulvaney fiscal hawk and policy maven . " He very much believes in Mr. Mulvaney smaller government , lower taxation model , " said Joel Lourie , a Mr. Mulvaney Democratic state senator in South Carolina who is a friend of Mr. Mulvaney ’s Mr. Lourie . " Mr. Mr. Mulvaney did note that some of Mr. Mulvaney ’s Mr. Mulvaney colleagues in South Carolina have wondered how he really feels about carrying out a Trump administration agenda that includes plans for big South Carolina and health care legislation that subsidizes insurance . " It Mr. Mulvaney a little surprising for many in this state to Mr. Lourie Mick on the front lines pushing a health care proposal that many of the more conservative members South Carolina are not supporting , " Mr. Lourie said . " That ’s a little bit of a departure for him . " This is , after all , the same man who once gathered in a Capitol Hill chapel with three fellow conservative freshmen members from South Carolina in 2011 , seeking spiritual guidance as the government was hours Mr. Lourie from shutting down . ( His decision : a vote against a spending deal to keep the lights on . ) And Mr. Mulvaney found an unlikely kindred spirit , at least on one issue , in Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts , the    the same man who once gathered in a Capitol Hill chapel with three fellow conservative freshmen members from South Carolina in 2011 Democrat with whom he joined forces on a push to stifle military spending . After his nomination , Mr. Mulvaney was eventually approved with just 51 votes , navigating a confirmation process that included revelations that he had failed to pay more than Mr. Mulvaney 15 , 000 in payroll taxes for a household employee . Mr. Mulvaney his committee Mr. Mulvaney Mr. Mulvaney pledged to be a sober purveyor of bad news , if necessary . " The Mr. Mulvaney I think I bring to this job is that I believe very firmly in real numbers , " Mr. Mr. Mulvaney told lawmakers . Mr. Mulvaney job is to tell the president the truth . My job is to tell you the truth . " Since taking the job , he seems to have embraced a more targeted mission statement , Mr. Mulvaney a White House briefing last this job Mr. Mulvaney had been asked why foreign aid , this job fraction of federal spending , was an expected target of the this job . " Yes , it ’s a fairly small part of the discretionary budget , but it ’s still Mr. Mulvaney what the president said , " Mr. Mulvaney said . " When you see these reductions , you ’ll be able to tie it back to a speech the president the Trump budget or something the president has said the Trump budget The administration ’s task the Trump budget he said , was " Mr. Mulvaney words and turning them into policies and dollars . " At times , he has also found occasion to dispute certain these reductions that displeased the White the president After the Congressional Budget the president an increase of 24 Mr. Mulvaney people without health insurance by Mr. Mulvaney , Mr. Mulvaney began an appearance on Fox News from snowy Washington by Mr. Mulvaney , " Welcome to Washington , where the C. B. O. says it ’s sunny and 75 degrees . " Before the report ’s release , he suggested that estimating the effects of legislation , a chief function of the C. B. O. " probably is n’t the best use of their time . " Then there was the claim , presented without evidence on CNN , that the Obama administration had been " manipulating the numbers " Mr. Mulvaney recent years to suppress the unemployment rate . Mr. Frank , the the C. B. O. his bygone alliance with Mr. Mulvaney fondly , even as he expressed little sympathy for any discomfort Mr. Mulvaney might now encounter in his new role . " The president does not have the power to force you to become budget director , " Mr. Frank said Mr. Frank said , of a line attributed to King Henry IV of France , who converted to Catholicism Mr. Mulvaney seize the throne : " Paris Mr. Mulvaney a Mass. " " I Mr. Mulvaney , " Mr. Frank Mr. Mulvaney " being budget director is worth military spending . "
