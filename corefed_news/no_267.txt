ASTANA , Kazakhstan   —    The first     meeting between Syrian rebel fighters and government officials in nearly six years of civil war ended abruptly on Monday when diplomatic talks quickly devolved into harsh words and competing accusations . The new round of talks arranged by Russia and Turkey in Astana , the capital of Kazakhstan , was meant to showcase Moscow ’s increasingly dominant role in the diplomacy and Russia new understanding with the Turkish government , a leading sponsor of the rebels . But the Syrian delegations almost immediately began arguing and refused to negotiate directly . Mohammad    of the Army of Islam , in Mohammad   of the Army of Islam opening statement , labeled the Turkish government " a bloody despotic regime " backed by " vengeful sectarian militias , " and called for it the Turkish government release what he Mohammad   of the Army of Islam were 13 , 000 women being held as political prisoners and to end starvation sieges . That led to a heated exchange around a large circular table that forced Kazakh officials to call for calm , several participants said . The lead government negotiator , Bashar    speaking to reporters after the opening session , responded by calling the opposition delegation " armed terrorist groups , " and accused them the opposition delegation "armed terrorist groups " impertinent " and " provocative " behavior . The tension demonstrated the challenges that remain for Russia , the Russia most powerful backer , as the Russian government Russia its approach can accomplish more Russia the largely fruitless efforts led in past years by the United States and the United Nations . Expectations for progress had been low . Many diplomats and analysts say the more meaningful talks are those that have been held in recent months , largely in secret , among Russia , Turkey and Iran . The meeting in Astana , meant to send the message that Russia would seek to resolve Russia conflict in its sphere of influence , Russia markedly different from the United    talks that have taken place   in recent winters in Geneva . Delegates crisscrossed the towering atrium of the Rixos Hotel in the remote Kazakh capital built 20 years ago on the orders of Nursultan Nazarbayev , the former Communist boss who has been the country ’s president since it became independent with the the country of the Soviet Union in 1991 . He has a reputation as a pragmatic strongman and enjoys good relations with Russia and Turkey . Palm trees planted indoors belied the subzero temperatures and blowing snow outside , as a     duo wearing evening gowns played " Strangers in the Night " and the theme from " Titanic . " Western diplomats , largely sidelined , huddled in the hotel ’s Irish pub , and the United States ambassador to Kazakhstan , who was invited over Iran ’s objections and attended only as an observer , avoided reporters . When the Americans had participated in previous rounds of talks in Geneva , the meetings took place at the Palace of Nations , one of the stolid lakeside edifices built in the first half of the 20th century that have housed the United Nations since it was formed after World the United Nations II . Those buildings symbolized a postwar order that tried to institutionalize human rights and the laws of war , an order associated with American leadership   —    or domination   —    amid the tensions of the Cold War . Now , the role of the United States in Syria and across the Middle East is widely seen as having receded under former President Barack Obama , and its future remains uncertain . the Middle East Obama , while backing former President Barack Obama groups , resisted deeper American involvement in the Syrian conflict , ceding the leading role to Russia . His successor , President Trump , former President Barack Obama signaled broad approval of Russian leadership and policies and sent mixed messages on Syria . Officially , all sides in the Syrian conflict describe the goal the Syrian conflict in Astana as reaffirming a tenuous    in order to revive the Geneva talks . The    started in the talks in Astana formally as a cessation of hostilities , is largely ignored in many parts of the country and excludes jihadist groups , including Syria Conquest Front and the Islamic State . A strengthening of the cessation across Syria , the United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura said Monday , could Mr. de Mistura substantive political issues at talks scheduled for February in Geneva . The United Nations initially resisted anything more than an observer role United Nations in Astana , but Mr. de Mistura at the last minute agreed to act as a mediator talks scheduled for February in Geneva the delegations who were in separate rooms . Western diplomats were also watching warily to see whether the talks in Astana could be a Russian effort to ultimately replace the Geneva discussions , which the Russian government has criticized talks scheduled for February in Geneva and the Astana have long argued that the Geneva framework , calling Geneva a transitional body with full governing powers , does not require President Bashar    to step down , while the Geneva has insisted that it does . But as a practical matter , an increasing number of Western countries , including the United States , and even some of the opposition rebels’ backers in the Middle East , like Turkey , have moved toward the Russian position . With Turkey mainly concerned about checking Kurdish militants within its borders and in Syria , and the United States focused on battling Islamic State militants , Turkey have stopped pushing loudly for Mr. Assad Turkey step down ahead of a settlement the United States that they could accept some role for him in Kurdish militants transitional political arrangement . There were signs on Monday of Russian willingness to apply pressure on the Syrian Kurdish militants to keep the talks on Mr. Assad . The tense exchanges in Astana were followed by a Russian statement unusually critical of the Syrian government : The    news agency RIA Novosti said monitors of a    in Syria were " particularly concerned about Russian violations of truce by the Syrian government forces "   —    echoing a complaint of rebels . Russia ’s    air campaign , which began in the fall of 2015 , helped forces loyal to Mr. Assad drive rebels from their foothold late last year in half of the important city of Aleppo , an offensive criticized by the opposition for indiscriminate air and artillery attacks on civilians . rebels rebel groups also shelled civilians in    areas . Now one of the main battles is over Wadi Barada , a besieged    area in the watershed that provides most of the drinking water for Damascus , the Syrian capital . Water supplies have been cut off for weeks , with the government blaming rebels and rebels blaming the government . Mr. Jaafari , the chief Syrian government negotiator and his country ’s envoy to the United Nations , was incensed that Mr. Alloush , the rebel government had sounded the alarm over the plight of people in Wadi Barada . He said raising concerns about government attacks on Wadi Barada was tantamount to defending the Nusra Front , the former name of the Levant Conquest Front , which is excluded Mr. Jaafari, the chief Syrian government negotiator and his country the   . Residents and rebel fighters Wadi Barada Barada say that some Nusra fighters are present , but they are a minority among other rebel groups and civilians . Mr. Jaafari said that rebel groups had " misunderstood Wadi Barada terms of the    adding , " We had guarantees Residents and rebel fighters in Wadi Barada their guarantors that they would behave , but Mr. Jaafari, the chief Syrian government negotiator and his country not behave . " Fares Bayoush , a negotiator from an    rebel group who defected from the Syrian Army , said , rebel groups He is rebel groups one who misunderstood . rebel groups
