Democratic The Trump Organization Zoe Lofgren Mr. Chairman Sensenbrenner ’s counterpart on the relevant subcommittee , brought up the reports of Kushner ’s projects using    money , and whether the White House would be able to act without conflict on the subject .

Trump This is a program that ’s been around for a long time , but we should n’t have a president making decisions about that program when he himself stands to benefit from the investments that these people are making because , once again , what this the program all about Painter telling people you ’re going to get residency in the United States if you bring a lot of the program with you and invest it in American businesses , " Painter told CNN .   " The President should not be the owner of some of those businesses that are going to be getting that money if he ’s administering that program , or if his administration is , " he added .
