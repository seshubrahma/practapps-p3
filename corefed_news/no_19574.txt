’   ’ "    Peter Thiel , a PayPal founder and tech luminary , upset a lot of    people by endorsing Donald Trump . ( Was n’t Silicon Valley supposed    to be liberal ? ) He has also upset people by crushing Gawker    Media , attacking the college system , criticizing    multiculturalism , and more . " "    Thiel usually explains He actions in libertarian or pragmatic    terms . He does stuff to promote individual freedom . He does stuff    because    ’s logical . " "    If you look at He wonkier writings , however , it ’s Thiel Thiel recognizes a larger historical mission . In short , He ’s    trying to save the world from apocalypse . " ’    " We are in a deadly race between politics and technology , " Thiel    Thiel a . " The future will be much better    or much worse , but the question of the future remains very open    indeed .    .. The fate of our world may depend on the effort of a    single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom    that makes the world safe our world . " ’ "    Thiel ’s philosophy , though complex , is coherent and provocative .    It ’s also arguably      —    at least in the classical sense of    valuing individual freedom . " "    In this article , we ’ll try to break it down and show this article it    relates to this article    . Thiel declined to be Thiel’s , so    we ’ll focus    his past comments . Thiel’s "    To understand Thiel    outlook , Thiel’s to look at mimetic    theory , an idea developed by René Girard , whom Thiel studied with    at Thiel’s and in whose name . " ’    " I’’ve noticed that it takes a long time to really sink in , "    . " You can    understand what his words    as philosophical    without    understanding how those concepts    out in philosophical concepts without    " ’ ’ Like Girard , Thiel believes that . .. ’ " . .. mankind ’s extraordinary capacity for mimesis , aka    imitation , leads to envy . " ’    Human see , human want . ’ ’    In ancient cultures , this often resulted in chaos . ’ ’    " The fundamental problem in these cultures was that there were    all sorts of conflicts everywhere , "   according to notes by his former    student Blake Masters , which we’’ll treat as verbatim . ’ ’ . .. society controls tensions through    scapegoating . ’ ’    " Where warring civilizations didn’’t just collapse entirely , the    most common resolution involved polarizing and channeling all the    hostility into one particular person , " Thiel told his class . ’ ’    Early examples of scapegoats might include Oedipus and Julius    Caesar . Recent examples might include Bill Gates , Kanye West , and    Donald Trump . ’ ’    By literally or figuratively sacrificing these figures , people    are able to find a cathartic release for anger , envy , and other    destructive urges . ’ ’ . .. modern thought aims to uncover the truth about    society . ’ ’    The fact that society is built on violence and justified by lies .    The fact that we have these violent urges in us . ’ ’    Girard we Thiel hold the New Testament as a seminal text , with    its defense of innocent victims through the New Testament and its focus on    Christ , the New Testament most innocent scapegoat of all . ’ ’    " For Girard , the knowledge of the founding murder is driven by    the historical working of the    revelation , " . " The revelation may be slow ( the   revelation    contains a message that humans the   revelation not wish to hear ) but it is    not reversible . " the   revelation ’    Thiel also describes modern thought in terms that might be called    liberal or libertarian . As   " The breakthrough involved a single    revolutionary idea : that individuals exist and have rights , and    that these rights are independent of the cultures these    individuals happen to inhabit . " ’ ’    The spread of modern thought might lead to paradise , but . .. ’ ’ . .. modern thought is dangerous . ’ ’    By exposing the lies that hold up society   —    e. g. that we are    good and others are evil   —    modern thought makes it harder to    justify ongoing exploitation . ’ "    What ’s more , modernity has introduced ever larger societies ,    opening the possibility for ever larger    rivalries . Today ,    for instance , people around the    might be aware of and    jealous of how people in the    live . " ’    " For Girard , this combination of mimesis and the unraveling of    archaic culture implies that the modern    contains a    powerfully apocalyptic dimension , " Thiel wrote in 2004 . ’ ’   ’ ’ Where Thiel goes beyond Girard is in ideas Thiel    influencing Girard future . ’ ’    Thiel laid out his own worldview at Thiel 2004 philosophical Thiel conference , which he sponsored , on " . " Thiel   " Thiel’ ’s    contribution to the conference , seeks common ground between    Girard’ ’s mimetic theory of human social life    …      and the work of    two      political philosophers who were    in vogue in the years following   : Leo Strauss    …      and Carl    Schmitt . " ’ ’    In a world of nuclear weapons , facing the scale of terrorism seen    on    or worse , true liberal thinkers must act forcefully to    spread their values and stave off    risks true liberal thinkers Thiel    argued . ’ ’    On the philosophical front , that meant reengaging with important    questions about human nature   —    e. g. what are good and evil and    why is society the way it is . ’ ’    " Today , mere    forces all of us to look at the    world anew , to think strange new thoughts , and thereby to awaken    from that very long and profitable period of intellectual slumber    and amnesia that is so misleadingly    the Enlightenment , "    Thiel wrote . ’ ’    On the political front , that meant taking occasionally secret or    undemocratic actions . ’ ’    " Instead of the United Nations , filled with interminable and    inconclusive parliamentary debates that resemble Shakespearean    tales told by idiots , we should consider Echelon , the secret    coordination of the world’ ’s intelligence services , as the    decisive path to a truly global pax America , " Thiel    wrote . ’ ’    " The postmodern world , " Thiel wrote , " could differ from Thiel       modern world in a way that is much worse or much better   —    the    limitless violence of runaway mimesis or the peace of the kingdom    of God . " ’ "    Thiel ’s apocalyptic mission   —    which might be described as    spreading individual freedom while preventing cataclysmic mimetic    violence   —    appears to be a factor in many of his actions . " ’    His attack on multiculturalism   —    his as in his 1995 book ,    " " his —    was a warning against a new form of scapegoating . ’ ’    " Rather than breaking the cycle of human history ,    multiculturalism merely represents another link in the long chain    of victimization and revenge , " Thiel wrote . ’ "    What ’s more , Thiel argued , debates about female culture Thiel black    culture , and a thousand other cultures were distracting from more    important questions about human culture . " ’    Founding PayPal , which launched in 1999 , may have been a way to    spread individual freedom and keep dangerous political forces in    check . Thiel said in an    speech ( Thiel " PayPal will give citizens worldwide more    direct control over their currencies than they ever had before citizens    It citizens be nearly impossible for    governments to steal    wealth from their people through their old means , corrupt governments if they corrupt governments try , the people will corrupt governments    dollars or pounds or yen , in    effect dumping the worthless local currency    something more    secure . " ’ ’      ’    PayPal , notably , didn’’t work quite as intended . September 11    " proved fatal to PayPal’ ’s libertarian ambition   —    electronic    currency systems suddenly seemed like ideal ways for terrorists    to hide money , " . ( The company sold to eBay in 2002    ’ ’    Founding Palantir , a big data analysis company specializing in    security , in 2004 , might have been Thiel’ ’s way of supporting    forceful but necessary political actions . Remember Thiel’ ’s line    about the global spy Thiel’’s being " the decisive path to    a truly global pax America " ? It is clearly echoed in     mission to fuse " data and analysis across    geographically dispersed users , providing commanders with the    latest intelligence no matter where they are . " ’ ’    Investing in the   latest intelligence , back in 2004 , could be read as a way to    spread individual freedom . As   " companies like Facebook create the    space for new modes of Facebook and new ways to form communities    not bounded by historical   . " Additionally , perhaps    Facebook was " a mechanism for the containment and Facebook of    mimetic violence in the face of an ineffectual state , "    —    let people fight on social media , and    they won’’t fight in real life . ’ ’ people Thiel did at least recognize the potential Thiel Facebook through    mimetic theory . ’ ’    " Facebook first spread by word of mouth , and Facebook ’s about word of    mouth , so it’ ’s doubly mimetic , " . " Social it’ proved to be more    important than it looked , because it’ ’s    our natures Social media " ’ " it’ Thiel ’s other activities in the past Thiel might be summed up as    trying to spread liberal innovation and disrupt stagnation    " ’    Thiel promoted innovations like artificial intelligence , Thiel    extension , and seasteading   —    the creation of new societies in    international waters . In his 2014 book , " , " Thiel championed the idea of true innovation Thiel going    from 0 to 1 ) as opposed to copying ( going from 1 to n ) . No wonder    he was popular in Silicon Valley . ’ ’    Thiel tried to disrupt what he saw Thiel an overpriced and       Thiel system , which he challenged    with $ 100 , Thiel Thiel Fellowships that required recipients to drop    out of college , and what he saw as an overpriced and incompetent Thiel government , which he challenged by supporting libertarian and    Thiel groups and candidates . ’ ’    Which just about brings us to the present . ’ ’   ’ "    In May 2016 , Thiel admitted to funding Hulk Hogan ’s Thiel    lawsuit against Gawker Media , which eventually bankrupted the    publication . This action upset many liberals because it appeared    to be an attack on the This action of the press   —    after all , Gawker    had antagonized Thiel in 2007 by outing him as Thiel , and now the    powerful man appeared to be getting revenge . " ’    Thiel publicly defended himself by saying he Thiel defending    Thiel issues of Thiel privacy . ’ ’    " The press is too important ’ ’    role be undermined by    those who would search for The press at the cost of the profession’ ’s    reputation , " . Thiel pointed to his support of the Thiel Committee to Thiel Journalists as evidence of good faith . ’ ’    Perhaps privately , Thiel worried that Gawker was stirring up Thiel tensions and slowing global progress with its gleeful embrace of    scapegoating . Shullenberger   in a    essay . ’ ’    " It seems reasonable to conclude that Thiel’ ’ ’       Gawker , which Thiel’ has repeatedly accused of ’’ bullying ’’ him and    other Silicon Valley power players , is closely connected to he core concern with scapegoating , derived from his longstanding    engagement with he ’s ideas , " Shullenberger wrote . Perhaps he Thiel    feared that Gawker was Thiel Thiel of    journalism that spread truth . ’ "    Gawker for his thoughts on sexual privacy , Thiel ’s Thiel appears to    follow his Thiel multiculturalism . He does n’t want Thiel    identify as a Thiel man ; he ’d rather identify as a human . "       In June 2016 , Thiel took his most provocative action yet .    Thiel at Thiel Republican National Convention , he . ’ ’    " I’’m not    Thiel . But neither is Donald Trump , " Thiel told    the audience . " He is Thiel builder , and it’ ’s time Thiel rebuild    America . " ’ ’ it’ ’ America    Thiel ’s support for Trump surprised many people who Thiel have    assumed that any smart person out of Silicon Donald Trump must be a    liberal , but it made sense Silicon Valley lot of ways . " ’    On    surface , Thiel any smart person out of Silicon Valley must be a   liberal have liked a candidate who was a Thiel founder , who mocked political correctness , who pledged to reduce    the size of government , and who , in general , seemed likely to    disrupt politics as usual . ’ ’    Although Thiel was once skeptical about politics         Thiel wrote in    2004 that " no new Thiel is in sight to cut the Gordian knot    of our age "   —    perhaps he saw Trump as the rare leader who might Thiel accomplish something . ’ "    On a deeper Donald Trump , perhaps Trump fit into Thiel ’s grand    historical plans . Here was Thiel who would disrupt the Donald Trump    mimesis caused by globalization , which encouraged people around    the world to compare their lives to everyone else ’s . Here was a    man who was already channeling mimetic tensions people around       scapegoating   —    conservatives were venting about Mexicans , the    Chinese , and Hillary Clinton , while liberals were venting about    Trump himself . By serving these functions , the provocative    candidate might paradoxically defuse or distract Donald Trump Donald Trump " ’    Perhaps ,   Trump is destined to    become a scapegoat for the ages , a kinglike figure who is in one    way Donald Trump another sacrificed to    a new world order . ’ ’    " Trump even viscerally looks the part of the old scapegoat kings    who would be ceremonially paraded before being sacrificed , " the    . ’ "    Has Thiel really done these things to ensure the spread of Thiel individual freedom , in pursuit of global peace ? Whatever exactly    he is doing , do n’t expect him to talk openly about it . " ’    Thiel subscribes to "    Straussian idea that it’ ’s Thiel       the intellectual elite    the ruling class it’ have secrets , "    Shullenberger wrote in an email . As scary as that sounds , one    might take faith in the idea that Thiel believes in a final    reckoning . ’ ’ Thiel " The Christian statesman or stateswoman must diverge from the    teachings of Strauss in one decisive respect , " Thiel wrote in    2004 . " One must never Thiel that one day all will be revealed ,    that all injustices will be exposed , and that those who    perpetrated them will be held to account . " ’
