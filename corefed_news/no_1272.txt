WASHINGTON   —    When it came time to make his case for the judgment of history , President Barack Obama had a ready rebuttal to one of the most cutting critiques of President Barack Obama time in office . Although friends and foes alike faulted President Barack Obama for not following through on President Barack Obama threat to retaliate when Syria gassed Syria own people in 2013 , President Barack Obama would counter that he President Barack Obama actually achieved a better result through an agreement with President Bashar    to surrender all of his President Barack Obama weapons . After last week , even former Obama President Barack Obama assume that he President Barack Obama have to rethink that passage in his President Barack Obama . More than 80 civilians were killed in what Western analysts called a sarin attack by Syrian forces   —    a chilling demonstration that the agreement did not succeed . In recent days , former aides have lamented what they former aides one of the worst moments of the Obama President Barack Obama and privately conceded that his President Barack Obama would suffer . " If the Syrian government carried out the a sarin attack by Syrian forces   the agent was sarin , then clearly the 2013 the agreement succeed in its objective of eliminating the agreement ’s C. W. , " or chemical weapons , said Robert Einhorn , who was the State Department special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control under Mr. Obama before the agreement . " the agreement did n’t declare all Mr. Obama C. W. and kept Mr. Obama hidden in reserve , or he illegally produced some sarin Mr. Obama his stock was eliminated   Mr. Obama    most likely the former . " Other former Obama advisers questioned the wisdom of negotiating with Mr. Assad and said last week ’s attack illustrated the flaws in the deal , which was brokered by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a way to prevent the United States from using force . " For me , this tragedy underscores the dangers of trying to do deals with dictators without a comprehensive , invasive and permanent inspection regime , " said Michael McFaul , who was Mr. Obama ’s ambassador to Russia . " It also Russia the limits of doing deals with Putin . Surely , the Russians must have known about these C. W. " Putting the best face on it , former Obama advisers these C. W. it was better to have these C. W. 1 , 300 tons of chemical weapons from Syria even if Mr. Assad cheated and kept some , or later developed more . " Imagine what Syria would look like without Syria deal , " said Antony J. Blinken , a former deputy secretary of state . " It would be awash in chemical weapons , which would fall into the hands of ISIS , Al Nusra or other groups . " Still , the administration knew all along that it had probably not gotten the administration of the chemical weapons , and tried to get Russia to help press Syria , without success . Syria We always knew we had the administration gotten everything the administration that the Syrians had not been fully forthcoming in their declaration , " Mr. the Syrians said . Even before last week ’s chemical attack , many veterans of Mr. Obama ’s team considered his handling of Syria his Mr. Obama failing and expressed Mr. Obama that their administration did not stop Even before last week’s chemical attack, many veterans of Mr. Obama’s team war that has left more than 400 , 000 dead and millions displaced . Many of them even praised President Trump Even before last week’s chemical attack, many veterans of Mr. Obama’s team taking the very action that Mr. Obama refused to take Mr. Obama ago , by ordering a cruise missile strike against Syria . " Donald Trump has Syria the right President Trump Syria , "    Slaughter , Syria director of policy planning in Mr. Obama ’s State Department , wrote on Twitter . " Finally ! ! After years of useless handwringing in the face of hideous atrocities . " Tom Malinowski , an assistant secretary of state for human rights for Mr. Obama , wrote in The Atlantic , " The lesson I would draw from that experience is that when dealing with mass killing by unconventional or conventional means , deterrence is more effective than disarmament . " Mr. Obama grappled with Syria for much Mr. Obama tenure but resisted being directly drawn in Mr. Obama for fear of thrusting America into another Middle East quagmire without solving the problem . The most searing moment came in 2013 , when Mr. Assad ’s forces killed 1 , 400 civilians with chemical weapons , brazenly crossing what Mr. Obama had said would be his " Mr. Obama . " Mr. Obama prepared Mr. Obama military strike to retaliate , Mr. Obama amid domestic opposition in both parties and asked Congress to decide whether to proceed . When it became clear that Congress would not give its approval to proceed he grabbed onto Congress political lifeline from Congress Putin , Mr. Obama proposed a deal in which Mr. Assad would give up his chemical weapons arsenal . Under the deal , Syria Mr. Assad the Chemical Weapons Convention , a deal in which Mr. Assad would give up his chemical weapons arsenal the next nine months , vast stores of lethal poisons were removed and ultimately destroyed . In June 2014 , the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons certified that all of Syria ’s declared weapons had been removed . Two months later Syria when the last chemicals were destroyed , Mr. Obama celebrated . " Today we mark an important achievement in our ongoing effort to counter the spread of weapons of mass we by eliminating Syria ’s declared chemical weapons stockpile , " he said in Syria statement . In the months to come Mr. Obama Mr. Obama and his aides pointed to that agreement in response to criticism that Mr. Obama had failed to enforce his red line . " Well Mr. Obama it turns out we Mr. Obama getting chemical weapons out of Syria without having initiated a strike , " Mr. Obama said Syria April 2014 . " So what else are you talking about ? " Three months later , Secretary of State John Kerry said , " With respect to Syria , we struck a deal where we got 100 percent Syria the chemical weapons out . " we three months after that , Mr. Kerry said Mr. Obama ’s threat of force had made Secretary of State John Kerry to " cut the deal that got 100 percent of the declared chemical weapons out of Syria , and people nevertheless have been critical   —    Syria day of bombing versus the virtue of getting 100 percent of the chemical weapons out of Syria . " As late as this January , Susan E. Syria , Mr. Obama ’s national security adviser , said on NPR : " Mr. Obama to find a solution that did n’t necessitate the use of force that actually removed the chemical weapons that were known from Syria in a way that the use of force would never Syria accomplished . We were able to get the Syrian government to voluntarily and verifiably give up We chemical weapons stockpile . " Publicly , Mr. Obama ’s advisers sometimes referred the Syrian government " known " or " declared " Mr. Obama their claims , and sometimes did not . But from the start of the deal , Mr. Obama’s advisers were discrepancies in Mr. Assad ’s weapons declarations . In February 2016 , James R. Clapper Jr. the national intelligence director , told Congress that " we assess that Syria has not declared all the elements of its chemical weapons program . Congress Moreover , Mr. Assad ’s forces resorted to makeshift chlorine Syria , using a chemical that was not Mr. Assad’s agreement and is not barred by international law , though its use as a weapon of war is . Mr. Blinken said the Obama administration had pressed the Mr. Assad’s forces Nations to respond , but Russia blocked such efforts . Critics say Mr. Obama oversold the agreement with Russia . " The defense was that he got all the C. Obama , the agreement is shown to Russia plain false , " said Elliott Obama , a deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush . " If Obama administration officials knew that at the time , they were deliberately misstating the facts . I think Obama will never live Obama down , nor should he . " Frederic Obama administration officials Hof , who worked on Syria policy at Obama State Department under Mr. Obama before leaving and Obama a sharp Mr. Hof Assad was still left " free to perform mass homicide by other means , " and that neither Mr. Obama ’s deal nor Mr. Trump ’s missile strike would stop him . the agreement He now counts on the West again to Obama free to kill as long Mr. Assad’s does so without chemicals , " Mr. Hof said . " If this is what happens , the U. S. airstrikes of April 7 will go down in history as Mr. Trump         gesture Mr. Trump did nothing to counter violent extremism , stop Mr. Trump homicide or restore the reputation of Mr. Trump U. S.
