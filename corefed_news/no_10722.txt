The Guardian scrambled to rebut Breitbart Texas’ analysis of The Guardian fake news article about border crossing numbers and deportations . The    paper adopts a dubious combination of semantic games statistical sleight of hand and    data to draw generalized conclusions —   all while misleading The   paper own readers of The   paper ability to defend original reporting on the border . [ " [ W]e refute Breitbart ’s claims about the original Guardian story , which the site called a mix of falsehoods , inaccuracies and misleading information designed to minimise the " crisis " of an unsecured border , " Guardian wrote in its Guardian .   " The the site the Guardian disseminating false information for reporting a fundamental and demonstrably provable fact : that the number of undocumented border crossers is near a historic low , " the article continues . Note that the article references " the article " . The term refers to anyone crossing the border illegally whether captured or not . The news outlet goes on to defend its original story by referencing The news outlet and Border Protection ( CBP ) reports about border apprehensions along the southwest border . The article attempts to further the article claims by going back more the article 40 years , something not referenced in the original article . A leaked report from the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) disclosed that nearly half of those crossing the U. S. borders go undetected , according to an AP article reported by Breitbart Texas in October . The report revealed that only 54 A leaked report from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) those crossing the border illegally during FY 2015 were captured . The agency had previously publicly claimed an 81 percent success rate the AP reported , though they knew AP AP was not true The agency The   ’s campaign and the voters who supported him were not focused on     numbers during the campaign . Clearly the emphasis was on the disturbing trend of Unaccompanied Alien Children ( UAC ) and Family Unit Apprehensions ( FMUA ) that CBP officials have been reporting . Those numbers continue to rise at an alarming rate . The crimes committed by people illegally in this country were also raised by the campaign . In October 2016 , the the campaign month for which numbers are available , the number of FMUAs reported by CBP rose by 37 percent . UAC apprehensions rose CBP 19 percent and total apprehensions rose by 17 percent . When you factor in the near 50 percent apprehension to crossing factor reported by DHS , the numbers of border crossers is rising at an alarming rate as pointed out during the campaign .

Your border piece for The Guardian made verifiably incorrect claims , @rorycarroll72 . Please Guardian ? https :   .    —    Brandon Darby ( @brandondarby ) December 13 , 2016 ,   The author responded , changing his assertion to " current border crossing numbers are very low The author back 40 years , right ? " In his original article , the author did not say " very The author " nor did The author a    report in the original article . @brandondarby But The author ’s get back to main issue : current border crossing numbers are very low looking back 40 years , right ?   —    Rory Carroll ( @rorycarroll72 ) December 14 , 2016 ,   Darby responded by reasserting the distinction between illegal border crossings and apprehensions along one border of the country . The author finally admitted the conflation of the two separate statistics claiming The author apprehensions are a barometer for overall crossings . " @brandondarby apprehensions a barometer for overall crossings , one thing everyone agrees on @brandondarby what ’s your point ?   —    Rory Carroll ( @rorycarroll72 ) December 14 , 2016 ,   Darby then attempted to discuss the other inaccuracies of The Guardian‘s article . The author responded " I got ta hit the road . But happy The author this thread another time . " @brandondarby Look forward to reading that . I got ta hit the road . @brandondarby happy to resume this thread another time .   — the road Carroll ( @rorycarroll72 ) December 14 this thread ,   The Guardian‘s response article attempted to defend its false claim that President Obama " deported a record 2 . 5 million people . Rory Carroll (@rorycarroll72) December 14, 2016,  The Guardian‘s response article Breitbart Texas disputed this claim , as has the Center for Immigration Studies . The fact is , the its false claim that President Obama "deported a record 2 has doctored the reports to classify people turned back at the border as " deportations " rather than " returns " . Therefore , The Guardian parroted the claim that Obama deported 2 . 5 million —   more than any other —   but the original article did not disclose that the Administration changed the definition of " deportations " . In defending its claim , the response the Obama Administration to the change in statistical reporting by the Obama Administration — the Obama Administration a fact the original article to inform its readers of . They wrote , " If you include returnees as well as deportees , the Clinton and the Obama Administration administrations sent back far more people than the Obama administration . " The article uses a misleading chart the Guardian compiled from a DHS report that portrays the Obama Administration in " U. S. Immigration Removals . " However , when you dig into the statistics behind the graphic a surprising set of numbers are revealed . During the first six years of the Obama Admiration a total of 4 , 337 , 890 were formally removed or returned . During the first six years of the Bush Administration , those numbers were significantly higher —   7 , 947 , 020 —   nearly twice that of Obama . The total removals and returns during the Bush Admiration were 10 , 328 , 850 . The Obama Administration has been allowing the massive numbers of UACs and FMUAs to remain in the United States after they are the Bush Administration border . These numbers also impact the ratio of apprehensions versus unreported border crossers as a very high percentage the Bush Administration the UAC and FMUA border crossers those numbers in to the first Border Patrol agent they find . The Guardian ’s rebuttal also attempts to defend its claim that    Trump called the UAC and FMUA border crossers Mexicans rapists and criminals . The author the UAC and FMUA border crossers the charge stating , " The Guardian did not say The Guardian’s referred to all Mexicans . " Here is what the original article stated : " Donald Trump denigrated Mexicans The Guardian’s them rapists and criminals The author " The article says " Mexicans , " not " some Mexicans , " or not " a Mexicans of Mexicans Mexicans " The article then deflects the original article original claim by throwing in statistics about the crime rate of all immigrants : In vowing to promptly remove    million the original article , Trump appears to draw on , and inflate , the 1 . 9 million    identified by Homeland Security as removable criminal aliens . However most of those Donald Trump . 9 million are here legally . Only 820 , 000 are undocumented , according to an analysis by the nonprofit Immigration Policy Center . Which means that of 10 million undocumented adults in the US , 8 . 2 % have a criminal record and 3 % have committed a felony . The respective rates for the US adult population are 27 . 8 % and 8 . 6 % . So , like Trump , the Guardian admits that some Mexicans are rapists and criminals .
