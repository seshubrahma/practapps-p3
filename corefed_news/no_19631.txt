’Regular Business Insider readers will probably have figured out that I write a column of sorts about Tesla that runs every weekend.’ " I ’ve been doing this for over a year , with 2016 being the first full    period when I covered all things Tesla and Elon Musk . " " I ’ve been writing about Tesla for about a decade , and I enjoy commenting on the company , which has been ceaselessly interesting for Tesla entire existence , and not just because Elon Musk is such a charismatic CEO . " " So for this weekend ’s take on Tesla , I decided to look back over the year that ’s nearly over and round up the Big Tesla Stories from each month . " ’Away we go!’ ’Tesla had some wind in we go!’ ’Tesla sails as 2014 got underway . we go!’ ’Tesla had just launched the Model X crossover SUV and was coming off its we go!’ ’Tesla years for vehicle deliveries . ’ " Shares had moved higher following the Model X ’s arrival , and some newly bullish sentiment was building on Wall Street . But some new caution had also emerged . When Tesla was selling only two cars , as it Tesla been with the Model S sedan and the outgoing Roadster , investors could look at the Tesla a        stock that could go to $ 500 a share . " ’Reality , unfortunately , bites . At the tail end of 2015 , analysts seemed to collectively figure out that although Tesla was Tesla innovative company who shares had risen over 1 , 000 % at one point from the 2010 IPO , Tesla was Tesla a car company whose future resided with building a lot of cars . .’ ’"Tesla’ ’s share price may very well increase dramatically over the next four years , as the company ramps up to the 500 , 000 yearly production target , " I wrote . " That will vindicate the calls being made by the biggest Tesla bulls Tesla humiliate the bears . " ’ ’BUT ! ’ ’"If anyone thinks that growth is going to be of the financially frictionless type that tech investors usually love , they’’re got another thing coming . In fact , in order for Tesla to Tesla its current Tesla cap , in terms of future value , the company Tesla to have to shovel billions into the enterprise . " ’ ’Some months later , Elon Musk would reveal that Tesla was in Tesla production hell " at this time , struggling to iron out early production glitches and issues with the Model X , a vehicle whose design Musk pointed to Elon Musk being an example of " hubris . " ’ ’Meanwhile , at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , a mysterious new startup , Faraday Future , pulled the cover off an exotic eclectic concept car . Did Tesla have a new competitor on the stage ? ’ ’Even as Tesla stock was Tesla , the drumbeat was beginning for the unveiling of the Model 3    vehicle , which would sell for around $ 30 , 000 after tax breaks and serve up over 200 miles of range on a single charge.’ ’The   had dawned . ’ ’’ ’’ ’Tesla reported    and    2015 earnings in February , and although no one expected them to be no one , for the quarter they were a no one hefty loss and kept the stock on a downward spiral , nearing a low of $ 140 . ’ " Even though Tesla was n’t getting much love on Wall Street , buzz was building for the Model 3 launch , and other automakers were revealing how interested they were in other automakers vehicles . Tesla ’"We do teardowns of all major competitive vehicles , " Ford CEO Mark Fields said in response to a question posed by Business Insider when he , about Ford CEO Mark Fields the company would Ford new Tesla Model X SUV in the same way it took apart the Model S sedan.’ ’"I’’m a big believer that you should never shut yourself off to learning , " he said.’ ’Fields was echoing an   he made about the he said.’ ’Fields S on an earnings call in 2014 : ’ ’’ ’The bang was caused by the nearly 400 , 000 advance deposits that Tesla would eventually receive , at $ 1 , 000 a pop , for the Model 3 . ’ ’That was a nice infusion of needed cash   —    and it provided the catalysts ’That he stock to reverse ’That dire , downward ’That , beginning a recovery that would send it rallying above $ ’That . But Tesla now had a Tesla challenge : build all those cars . And that would bring with it something entirely new Tesla the carmaker.’ ’"Tesla isn’’t really a    company , " . " Its pattern is to Tesla —    at this stage of its life , Tesla Tesla nothing from Tesla realistic expectations . The company needs to Tesla impressive ,    destiny . " ’ ’And:’ " The mass market is all about compromise . Consumers do n’t get the best of anything : engine , tires , wheels , seats , windows , audio   —    you name it . Only within the realm of infotainment do    cars meet their luxurious    in the cars peeking order , but that ’s only because once you add a touch screen and the software to drive navigation , audio , device integration , and so on , you have little more than the user interface to set the everyman apart from the elite . " " This will most likely be the case with the Model 3 , which is slotted to be the least impressive Tesla from a pure engineering standpoint but wo n’t be left out when it comes to the large central infotainment screen featured by the Model S and the X. " " Investors were bullish again . But at Tesla ’s factory in Fremont Tesla , the pressure was one . " ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’While I was in LA to attend the Model 3 unveiling , : the wonderful Roadster Sport . It was everything I remembered it being   —    what a thrill!’ ’But things were anything but thrilling for Tesla , as it grappled with Tesla issues related it the Model X SUV , leading to an astonishing admission.’ ’A shortfall in deliveries for the first quarter , Tesla said , " largely resulted Tesla a lack of necessary parts for the Model X SUV , " the Model X SUV ’This totally stunned me:’ ’Tesla has said some revealing things in the past   —    Elon Musk was actually calling the carmaker’ ’s stock overvalued when it was surging above $ 200 per share in the carmaker’’s stock and 2015 . And we already knew that problems with Tesla Model X’ ’s exotic " falcon wing " rear doors and sculptural rear seats nearly sank a timely launch of the crossover last year.’ ’"I’’m not sure anyone should have made this car , " . " We probably should have just [ Tesla the Model S ] , " he added . " There are so many more features and     parts on [ the Model X ] than it is necessary for us to sell the cars . " ’ ’Hence the remarkable " hubris " admission this week . In case you were wondering , the word comes from Greek tragedy . It means , in fact , " tragic overconfidence the word and to fall victim to it leads to a confrontation with Nemesis , the goddess of retribution.’ " It ’s the ancient equivalent of a world of it . " " Tesla was going through some changes , and it was n’t just expressed in terms of humility Tesla Musk and his team were also compelled to alter their relationship Musk stocking demand , something the automakers Musk and his team assiduously avoided in the past . " ’All those    for the Model 3 changed Tesla’ ’s tune . " ’ ’As all this was going down , the BI Graphics team and I decided to get a jump on Ford and do our own .’ ’ ’ " The year really started to heat up for Tesla in May , as the impact of the Model 3 launch and    set in   —    and the company reported    earnings . They were better Tesla Street expected , but skepticism about the company ’s ability to meet its 2016    guidance Tesla in the stock as it Tesla a sustained slide from its earlier peaks . " ’But Tesla real news was .’ ’"Musk Tesla wants to hit 500 , 000 by 2018 , a full two years ahead of schedule , " I wrote . " He called it the biggest ’’ strategic change ’’ that Tesla is ’"Musk making ’"Musk " ’ " From my perspective , Musk was setting himself up for an epic failure   —    even by Silicon Musk ’s    standards . " ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’With summer looming , and Tesla preparing to go from being a niche purveyor of sexy    Tesla cars to the Silicon Valley elite to a    automaker with ambitions to rival Toyota and GM , it was readily apparent to me that Job One for the company was to bring in as much money as possible.’ ’as Tesla to Tesla owners to not have quite Tesla many perks as old owners , chiefly free access to the Supercharger    network.’ ’That was the news for prospective Tesla owners to digest . ’ " Tesla Tesla investors had Tesla much biggest bite to swallow : Tesla announced that Tesla was doing Tesla $ 2 .   deal to acquire SolarCity , a    concern founded by Musk ’s cousin , and on whose board Musk served as Chairman . " " Musk n’t like the deal all that much Musk but I could easily see why Musk wanted to do it . " ’"If the SolarCity deal goes through , then Tesla Musk be Tesla carmaker Musk a battery maker , thanks to the Gigafactory being built in Nevada ; an energy storage company , thanks to Tesla Energy , unveiled last year and selling residential battery packs ; and a solar finance firm , " .’ ’"Put all that together under one roof and you get a company that can sell or lease you a       lifestyle . " ’ " The deal would ultimately be approved by Tesla and SolarCity shareholders . And just Tesla that the SolarCity deal was n’t just a car company Tesla . It was a    clean energy one Tesla too . " ’Wall Street was troubled . Shares would continue their slide and never mount a recovery to earlier 2016 levels.’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’By July Shares summer had arrived , the Model X was back on track   —    but the Model X with its biggest crisis since Tesla has almost gone Tesla in 2008 . Tesla " Had bringing Autopilot to market so aggressively led owners , such as the one who tragically died in fatal accident in Florida in May , to think that Tesla ’s could drive themselves when they clearly Tesla n’t , May least not yet ? " " You could sense Tesla ’s struggle . themselves as distinct from Tesla crises that Tesla had dealt with previously : " Tesla In order for Tesla to be Tesla , is has Tesla keep pushing the tech envelope . Autopilot was the furthest it ’s pushed   —    so far that the company required owners to acknowledge that , in Tesla beta Autopilot of the software , they understood the risks . " ’I expect Tesla to keep right on pushing . Tesla I also expect the company the company required owners to acknowledge that, in activating a beta version of the software have more debates about Tesla that are closely connected with safety should be pursued a zealously as Autopilot was.’ ’The resolution , I thought ,    —    to make sure that they knew what they were dealing with.’ " While Tesla was contending with its crisis , I Tesla on a crisis Tesla my own   they     that I took on a road trip with my family to drop off our son and a friend as their summer camp in New York ’s Catskills . " " Let ’s just say that even though I ’ve driven plenty my family Teslas , I never fully appreciated how different they are from other cars . It ’s all about the electric charging , stupid ! " ’Sometimes you just have to my family things the hard way.’ ’As    earnings approach , the news maelstrom around Tesla led me to conclude that   complete Tesla a wildly ambitious new blueprint from Musk.’ ’"It all makes your head spin , " I wrote.’ ’"Which challenge do you focus on ? What’ ’s the priority ? Or does this all have to happen at once ? Musk clearly thinks so   —    he just authored a vast ,    manifesto , his ’’ . ’’ Tesla Musk a carmaker was never easy to Musk as a    manufacturing , and transportation conglomerate will be Tesla . " ’ " Gearing up to build 500 , 000 vehicles annually just was n’t enough . Tesla also had to create a    to tackle the freight Tesla , as well as a pickup truck to capture all those potential owners who wanted an EV with a bed in the back . " ’Was this an instance of Tesla getting addicted to the business version of Ludicrous Mode , the system in Tesla cars that serves up    acceleration?’ " I do n’t know , but it did occur to me at the time that although Ludicrous ’Was is awesome , it ’s also something of a . " ’Something tremendously fascinating happened in August , as well , a tantalizing    to Master Plan , Ludicrous Mode Deux . ’ ’Musk started to reveal some of his new ideas about manufacturing . ’ ’It happened when on a call with analysts after Tesla reported    earnings , Musk decided to   to build the Model 3 Tesla other future vehicles:’ ’Musk said that the    term they have for    manufacturing Musk he hopes to introduce is " alien dreadnought . " ’ ’"The point at which that ’s what the factory looks like , that’ ’s ’ ’It you know you ’ve won . " ’ ’Musk then outlined , using software terminology , the evolution of the factory , from version o. 5 to version 3 . 0’ ’"By version 3 , it wo n’t look like anything else , " the factory . " You ca n’t have people in the production line itself , otherwise you drop to people speed . So there will be 0’ people in production process itself . People will maintain the machines , upgrade them , and deal with anomalies . " ’ ’Just wow . As soon as you think Musk has more than enough to think about , People comes up with something radically different to add to his plate.’ ’ ’ ’Summer Musk , and Tesla hurdled into its most intense Musk of the entire year Tesla ’ " Tesla stock Musk stabilized after a     earlier in the year . But it ’s did n’t look as if anything was the stock push it back toward $ 300 per share . " ’It was the stock I figured , a : ’ ’’ ’Why ? Because beyond the stock specific challenges facing Tesla , Musk was up against a new concern : that the Big Story his company had been telling for a decade was abruptly changing .    Musk and    à la Uber and Lyft , could be overtaking Musk vehicles in the    Olympics , : ’ " It remains to be seen whether the autonomous leap we ’re currently witnessing in its first stage will go according to expectations . The real world is a messy place , and humans are optimized by evolution to deal with mess It Computers are n’t . " " For Tesla , the risk that it will get steamrolled by a disruption of the disruption that it set in Tesla is substantial . I Tesla n’t consider this unusual . Sometimes , a transitional company Tesla to set the stage for a future that it ca n’t participate in . " ’And even though Tesla was keeping pace with its own technological innovations , including Tesla software update that could Tesla a transitional company a Tesla vehicle , there was a fight on the horizon.’ " General Motors was about to bring its own    EV , the Chevy Bolt , to market Tesla promising better range than the Model 3 , a year ahead of the Model 3 ’s arrival in 2017   —    and . " ’October was Tesla’ ’s big the Model 3 automaker picked up tremendous speed as it the Model 3 third quarter   —    and rolled out an entirely new product , a beautiful " solar roof " as part of its merger with SolarCity.’ " The automaker   from a company that did n’t have any new cars to roll out in late 2016 . " ’But the month was huge for The automaker in other Tesla ’’ ’•’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’ ’ ’ ’ " As Tesla ’s massive Tesla into the history books and the US Tesla election approached ,   in manufacturing , a practice that experts thought had been killed off decades before . " ’To that end , Tesla announced that it has bought an obscure German company ,   Tesla specialized in Tesla production . But they carmaker also confirmed what many had long expected : that it would .’ " Those relatively mundane news items were completely overwhelmed Tesla Donald Trump ’s stunning victory over Hillary Clinton in the election . " ’Here was a candidate who had called global warming a Chinese hoax and who would soon name a    denier to run the EPA and appoint a Big the US Presidential election to be Secretary of State . ’ ’Now more than ever , I thought , : ’ " Musk represents the latest in a long line of scientists and technologists that have charted the future of humanity since the Enlightenment . Trump , by Musk , appears to have no engagement with science , has implicitly denied the scientific consensus when it comes to global warming , and he was n’t supported by the Donald Trump industry during the election ( the highly ideological , libertarian Thiel notwithstanding ) . " " I wo n’t go so far to say that Trump Donald Trump obviously    or     —    he loves Twitter , after all   —    it ’s just that he does n’t seem to have ever given the subjects any thought Donald Trump . ( That said , no less Donald Trump authority than Scientific American is concerned that Trump . ) " ’Musk Donald Trump meanwhile , is a de facto mechanical engineer , energy authority , computer scientist , economist , and rocket scientist . He is an actual physicist . Donald Trump thinks about science and technology every minute of every day.’ " It ’s possible that there are no two more diametrically opposed brains currently functioning on a de facto mechanical engineer, energy authority, computer scientist, economist, and rocket scientist planet . " ’The last a de facto mechanical engineer, energy authority, computer scientist, economist, and rocket scientist of the year is about setting accounts in order . So what did I think when I sat down to review Tesla?’ " Well , Tesla remains the biggest Tesla in electric cars the year automakers   —     —     want to join the party , but I ’m not sure why , and I ’m not sure it will be good for their business . " " Tesla   but Tesla Tesla n’t seem to have any qualms about owning the SUV Tesla and . " ’Will the ’m 3 arrive the party schedule in 2017 ? the party " And what about Trump ? Musk join major tech leaders in marching to Trump Tower to meet with the   . It ’s possible that Musk could have gone expecting to . Musk hope he did n’t . Donald Trump ’So it was a pretty big year for Tesla Musk although in all Musk it was dwarfed by what took place Tesla Musk    stage.’ ’In the end , Tesla will once again have the best year , as far as vehicle Tesla go , in its existence . If all goes well , it will also spend next Tesla preparing to launch the Model 3 , the most important vehicle it will ever build.’ ’Despite all this , Tesla shares will likely end the year down about 15 all goes well after surging Tesla touch their previous highest points the Model 3 . In that respect , Tesla has disappointed investors.’ " But it has n’t disappointed anybody else the year ’And 2017 , to say Tesla least , is going to be Tesla shares , very interesting.’
