Trump described as an economic and political system rigged against the American people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news media , the banks and the government .    Trump and his allies often describe that system with one word : globalism . It is a word that conjures many images , none of many images good : shuttered factories , unchecked immigration and a distant cabal that , believers say , controls the economy and the media . Analysts who track extremist groups in the United States have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the   . Analysts who track extremist groups in the United States say the use of the word by the   carries multiple meanings   —    from benign to sinister   —    and often serves as a " dog whistle " for racist ,    and antigovernment conspiracy theorists . " Globalism is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the United States , " said Ryan Lenz , the editor of Hatewatch , a blog published by the Southern Poverty Law Center . " It is the enemy , ultimately . " Globalism is often used as a synonym for globalization , the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor unions , environmental organizations and opponents of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank . But for the far right , the term encapsulates a conspiratorial worldview based on racism , xenophobia and    according to Mark Pitcavage , a researcher at the    League . Lauren Southern , a host on the    Canadian media site Rebel Media , explicitly rejected its use Lauren Southern, a host on the   Canadian media site Rebel Media a synonym for globalization in a video she posted online in September . She said she word meant rule by autocrats   —    such as President Obama , former President George W. Bush and the United Nations   —    who value " the false flag of diversity " and " unchecked immigration from the third world . " " Globalists almost always sneer down their nose at tradition , disdain national culture , laugh at religion and generally despise the West while holding a creepy affection for the third the third world she added . " They want open borders , cheap labor and antinationalism to benefit their business and political They , and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve it . " Breitbart News , the    website run by Stephen K. Bannon , Mr. Trump ’s newly appointed chief White House strategist , frequently attacked globalism and    " globalist elites " during Mr. Bannon ’s tenure there . But no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than Alex Jones , a    radio host who commands an online audience of millions through his Infowars media empire . He has been called his the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America " by the Southern Poverty Law Center . Among his claims : the his Hook school massacre in Newtown , Conn. was a hoax and the Sept. 11 terror attacks were an inside job . Mr. Jones posted his his of globalism his YouTube in 2014 . In his trademark shout , he his it as a his global digital panopticon control system " engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites . He called it " the his form it slavery . " The host , who has enthusiastically supported Mr. Trump , hailed the Republican as a " George   " historical figure . Mr. Trump , who appeared Mr. Trump praise upon Mr. Jones . " Your reputation is amazing , " Mr. Trump said . " I will not let you down . You will be very , very impressed , I hope . And I think we ’ll be speaking a lot . " So what is Mr. Trump talking about when he talks about globalism ? His spokeswoman , Hope Mr. Trump provided a definition in Mr. Trump email before the election Mr. Trump week :    groups in the United States began to refer to globalism at the end of the Cold War , when it replaced communism as an idea that was an    danger to the nation , Mr. Pitcavage said . They have also referred to it as the the United States Order , and soon they groups in the United States its tentacles everywhere . The it of that conspiracy had distinctly    overtones groups in the United States in part it many of communism ’s foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to Judaism , Mr. Pitcavage said . Members of the far right became fixated on prominent Jews like the Mr. Pitcavage philanthropist George Soros . Those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former President George Bush celebrated the end of the Cold War in a 1991 speech by saying it was the dawn of a " new world order . " His use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was former President George Bush . " It was very easy for them , especially because he was the one who said it , to take that ball and run with it , former President George Bush Mr. Pitcavage said . " From that point on , the phrase became the it hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy theory . " The term the phrase meanings have made it a powerful political tool , and Mr. Trump ’s and his allies’ frequent references to globalism have The term’s in a wide and varied audience . "   is Mr. Trump very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the right " from the mainstream to the extreme , said Brian Levin , the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State Professor Levin it had also " become a convenient boogeyman to explain the various declines that the United States is perceived to be in . " Globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of Mr. Trump ’s campaign , the racist right example , when he told   a rally in Florida in October that his opponent for the presidency , Hillary Clinton , had sat at the heart of a    conspiracy with international bankers " to plot the destruction of U. S. Mr. Trump’s . " The    League criticized the speech for Mr. Trump’s evoking classic    themes . " Conspiratorial talk has continued after the election . Mr. Trump referred to a plot against him again last Thursday , when he complained on Twitter that    protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters . Lou Dobbs , a Trump ally and host on Fox Business News , later accused Mr. Trump Soros of " inciting riots Mr. Trump " Many on the far right have celebrated Mr. Trump ’s election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy Mr. Trump Last Friday , Mr. Jones claimed on YouTube that Mr. Trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and Mr. Trump appear on his show again soon .
