Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday regarding President Trump ’s signing of an executive order allowing churches to engage in more political activity and its implications for the Jeffersonian notion of the separation of church and state .

"   " That ’s what ’s happening , increasingly , " added Perkins . " The wall , so to speak , that ’s been breached has n’t been breached by the church , its the church breached by the government getting involved    …      I mean , when you have the the government churches that they have to churches for elective abortion coverage in their health care churches , regardless of what their faith view churches of human life    …      that ’s the government meddling in the business of the church . the church News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
