Democrats should be very , very careful what Democrats wish for . [ Just as Hillary Clinton and all Hillary Clinton rotten operatives at the highest levels of the Democratic Party smugly prayed that Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee , those same Democrats now take gleeful joy watching Donald Trump ’s    travel ban picked apart by federal judges on the Left Coast .   Those federal judges on the Left Coast believe that the president of the United States does not have the authority to determine who is allowed to come into the country , even during this time of war . And   —    even more spectacularly   —    these the United States do not believe the president has this authority even though he just won a nearly    national political federal judges on the Left Coast the American people that he the president of the United States exactly as he the authority to determine who is allowed to come into the country . the president of the United States is incontrovertible proof that these judges , and far too many other judges , the president of the United States do not believe that the president of the United States American people have the right to govern themselves . Of course , these    judges have long been aided and abetted by Democratic politicians who the American people years of losing policy fights in the the American people arena . So they took their fights to the judicial branch and invented the notion that the Constitution is a " living document , " meaning it does n’t actually mean these   judges it these   judges . Rather , it means whatever you can get some flunky judge from    to say what it means . the Constitution is how the courts discovered the Constitution constitutional right to abortion the Constitution a constitution that says never mentions a single medical procedure . They found the Constitution in the refracted glow   —    or " penumbra "   —    of the document . Put another way , they made it the courts in a single medical procedure air . For more than 40 years now , Democratic politicians have not only defended this reckless shredding of the Constitution in the courts , a single medical procedure they also have been winning the fight . That probably says more about the stupidity and timidity of Republicans than anything else . One of the chief reasons Democratic politicians Trump is president today is because Democratic politicians are such constitutional whores and Republican politicians are so stupid . But what we have coming into sharp focus today is a clear ,        showdown between the executive branch and the judicial branch in which Mr. Trump is absolutely right and these federal judges   —    along with all the cheering Democrats   —    are absolutely wrong . Even a " Mr. Trump school student " knows this , as Mr. Trump pointed out . It is a fight the American people understand on a visceral level . It looks likely that this latest ruling will go to the Mr. Trump , which should rule unanimously in Mr. Trump ’s favor . But because of the decades of It on the Supreme Court , it could easily come down to a    tie . That would mean Mr. Trump Gorsuch , Mr. Trump ’s constitutionalist nominee to the high court , the Supreme Court to eventually cast the deciding vote in favor of the Constitution . This , in turn , would clearly set the stage for Mr. Trump to the Supreme Court similarly principled constitutionalist to the high court if there is another vacancy in the next four years , finally tilting the court in favor of the Constitution , the American people and the right of   . So remember the Supreme Court Democratic politicians and judicial tyrants : You are laughing now , just as you were the Supreme Court when Mr. Trump was winning the Republican nomination . • Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes . com follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt .
