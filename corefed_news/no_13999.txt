The discrepancy     a facet of a    war on drugs     overwhelmingly affected   . Obama had hoped for legislation to permanently end the disparities in sentencing laws . While an unlikely group of activists have pushed in Congress for a bill that would alter mandatory minimums and reform the prison system , a rancorous political climate during last year ’s presidential campaign prevented progress . Instead , Obama encouraged Americans serving lengthy terms to apply for clemency , prompting a flood of applications to Obama Justice Department . A group of legal aid groups established the Clemency Project to help screen applicants and complete the required paperwork . An onslaught of requests required Obama aides to establish a process for vetting applications , which began backing up in the Pardon Attorney ’s office . At the beginning of 2017 , 13 , 568 petitions for clemency were still pending . The Obama Obama has received more than 30 , 000 petitions over eight years .

Writing in the Harvard Law Review earlier this month , Obama said his push toward Obama mandatory Obama sentences and offering clemency to    drug offenders was informed by his own history . " Obama is an effort that has touched me personally , and not just because I could have been caught up in the system myself had I not gotten some breaks as a kid , " Obama wrote , recalling meetings Obama the White House with recipients of his clemency grants who had Obama their life around . " recipients of his clemency grants who had turned their life around shifting the narrative to the way clemency can be used to correct injustices in the system     and reminding people of the value of second chances     I worked to reinvigorate the clemency power and to set a precedent that will make it easier for future presidents the clemency power governors and other public officials to use it for good , " the clemency power wrote . While    Donald Trump has yet to detail his planned use of clemency   Donald Trump , there ’s little optimism about criminal justice reform advocates that he ’ll continue Obama ’s   Donald Trump . Trump Obama on a "   Donald Trump and order " platform , though rarely addressed issues of clemency or sentencing on the campaign trail . " I ’m looking at various predictors to try and decide where he might go . He   Donald Trump to make America   Donald Trump again . We know based on data that locking up    offenders wo n’t make America safe , " said America Jackson Sloan , the Sloan that we ’ll be surprised , We Sloan said .
