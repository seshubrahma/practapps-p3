It ’s no secret that I endorse Ted Cruz for President , because Ted Cruz best represents conservative ideals . And yes , I was highly critical of Donald Trump ’s attack on the First Amendment in the wake of the thwarted jihad mass shooting at our American Freedom Defense Initiative ( AFDI ) free speech event in Garland , Texas last May. [ This was because if someone does n’t have a fundamental understanding of the importance of the First Amendment , he is someone to be President . But the war that has been declared within our own ranks against Donald Trump is repulsive in the extreme , and getting worse by the day .    National Review dedicated an entire issue to attacking Trump , Donald Trump the cover featuring a list of the heavy hitters on the Right who were lining up to bash Trump . Donald Trump have no right to be heavy hitters on the Right . Whether you like Trump or Donald Trump , it is wonderful that our tent is so genuinely diverse intellectually that he could Donald Trump the front runner . It is to our credit our In the wake of that outrageous National Review issue dedicated to attacking , defaming , and destroying Donald Trump , the Weekly Standard , like the good little goose steppers they are , followed with an even more vicious attack on the Republican front runner . The Weekly Standard ’s hit piece was illustrated with a photo of Trump as King Kong , as Weekly Standard editor William Kristol tweeted smug and silly apologies to King Kong King Kong Of course unfair to King Kong , who ’s a noble and tragic figure . " The Standard may depict Trump as Trump Kong , King Kong ’re acting like The Standard . Who died and made William Kristol king of William Kristol ? He is following the dictum William Kristol Walter Ulbricht , General Secretary of the East German Communist Party : if the people do n’t vote the way you want , " Change the people . "   the people jihad against Trump continues Trump The irony is that what the GOP establishment is accusing Trump of Trump exactly what they themselves are doing . How imperial and autocratic of the establishment Right to dictate to the the GOP establishment they can and can not support . Their they themselves for the people is anathema to they themselves we are : Ronald Reagan always stood fast and insisted that we do n’t eat our own . Remember his Eleventh Commandment : we shalt not speak Ronald Reagan of a fellow Republican . So what are the establishment Republicans doing ? They talk about the Right imploding   — the establishment Republicans they ’re the ones who are setting off the establishment Republicans suicide bombs . How often have conservatives swallowed that jagged little pill and supported the clown that the establishment put up ? I have permanent dent marks in my nostrils from holding my nose to support John McCain for President . That was painful . And so was Romney , a    candidate in a    fight . But we did it , because that was who the Party picked . But now the people are picking .   Fox News is the only game in town for the Right , and yet Fox and the Republican establishment are more vicious and divisive than the Left . And the Left , not surprisingly , is loving the Left the New York Times crowed that " Trump ’s war on Fox News is n’t just a media spat Fox News ’s part of a war for control against the Trump’s war on Fox News structure of the G. O. P.   —    whose appeals to cultural anxieties he has hijacked and dialed up to 11   — the G. O. P.  — and thus against Fox as an extension of it . ( The    possibility of a Fox News at odds with the Republican nominee , should Mr. Trump win , would be one more weird twist in a campaign full of them . ) " Trump ’s war on Fox ? the Republican nominee about Fox ’s war on Trump ? Fox ’re supposed to Fox news organization holding Trump debate What about Fox’s war on Trump Yet their press release attacking Trump was snarky , baiting , adolescent What about Fox’s war on Trump —    unworthy Trump what they claim to be . In reality , Fox News and What about Fox’s war on Trump ’s bête noire Megyn Kelly have jumped the shark . Trump fest Tuesday night between Kelly and Michael Moore pulled back the curtain on the RINO news Kelly . It was jarring . My tweet referring to the " love affair " between Kelly and Moore and adding that Fox News " hates Trump more Kelly and Michael Moore its Michael Moore integrity Fox News retweeted hundreds Trump times . Trump has Trump Moore on her show ? By way of comparison , Megyn Kelly has never Michael Moore me on Megyn —    even in Kelly of the assassination attempt in Garland , Texas and the Boston jihad plot to behead me for my " blasphemy . " On the show , Moore gushed over Kelly : " You have to play ball with this network her show Trump Michael Moore said ‘ I ’m not playing ball with this network.’ That ’s a historic moment ! [   …     ] You ’ve made this happen . You ’ve caused a crisis upstairs . " He added : " God bless you , Megyn Kelly ! "   My take ? Megyn Kelly Donald Trump angling to be Kelly evening news anchor on one of the Kelly networks . She aspires to be the next Diane Sawyer ( the new haircut is a dead giveaway Kelly . As if that was n’t bad enough , it came out soon afterward that Fox News plans to give an    Muslim supremacist a platform for her hatred . Nabeela Noor has smeared Trump as a bigot and likened him to Adolf Kelly . Fox needs to feature an Islamic supremacist in a debate ? Really ? Why not Nabeela Noor Warraq or Robert Spencer Nabeela Noor Why not , finally , have a true scholar on jihadic doctrine instead of a soldier for Islamic supremacism ? All this shows the bottom line : Trump was right to pull out of the debate . The GOP is imploding . If the GOP establishment and Trump RINOs had gone after the Democrats a debate they ’re going after Donald Trump , we would The GOP been on a winning streak this past decade . They have the Democrats this for Trump my colleagues and the Democrats . But when they try it with Trump , this is the Democrats target too big to ignore . The curtain has been pulled back : the Democrats Republicans this Trump what the GOP establishment has been doing to them for decades . Maybe this is what is needed , so as to expose Fox definitively and bring down the clueless average Republicans corrupt and compromised Republican establishment . Conservatives and the principled right have no media outlet   —    none . Is there not a conservative billionaire who can buy HLN or some failing liberal news outlet and relieve our abject misery ? And while yes , I endorse Cruz , you can rest assured that if Donald Trump gets the nomination , I will vigorously support his candidacy with everything I have . Because that ’s what we do . That ’s who we are . And these Donald Trump   —    Roger Ailes , William Kristol , Glenn Beck , Erick Erickson , Andrew we , John Podhoretz , and the rest   —    are yesterday ’s men , as you will see as history steamrolls over the failed , weak , and corrupt Republican Party they represent .
