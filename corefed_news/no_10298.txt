Political analyst Pat Caddell offered Political analyst Pat Caddell take on the latest Breitbart    poll on Tuesday morning ’s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon . [ The topline result of the poll had Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump 42 % to 37 % in a    race which also included Libertarian Gary Johnson at 9 % and the Green Party ’s Jill Stein at 3 % .   Caddell said Caddell was particularly interested in segment of the survey that asked both the conventional " Is America on the wrong track ? " question , and also " Is America seriously on the wrong track ? " " A little less than half the country said we were seriously off on the wrong the wrong track another quarter basically said we were " Caddell we . " What ’s interesting is , if you drill down in some of those numbers , you find that , for instance , among young people , very high numbers   —    almost 70 % on the wrong track , the wrong track high for them . " Caddell asked why instance, among young people, very high numbers   powerful sense of America being on the wrong track has n’t translated to the wrong track for Donald Trump . " It ’s not yet , in part , because I do n’t think the election has joined around the issues , " Caddell replied . " We ’re still in a very    election , in which , right now , the press , all their attention has been devoted to   —    the press you will , I can portray it as ‘ ’ but I think that ’s the election mild understatement . And the Democrats , of course , have been hammering him , to keep it an election on personality . " He said the election " loose " focus on personality him keep the polls " very volatile , " until the focus shifts to issues during the presidential debates . " When you start looking at how people think the country ’s doing , the economy is doing America    for instance , you ’ve got a huge majority in this poll who show that they believe that America has gotten weaker internationally , people said Caddell .   " By the way , it ’s interesting , when both questions are framed for people , to frame the election , the election is much closer , depending again on how the election the questions , " he observed . Bannon asked why Trump ’s campaign has not the election able to the election the campaign narrative onto this favorable issue terrain . " Part of it is Trump himself , and part of it is a campaign that Trump’s   —    well , it be kind about it , the offensive campaign that they might have planned to do it was n’t in place , before the candidate kind of moved the campaign to other things , that made his personality and himself Trump’s campaign of the issue , " answered Trump’s .   Trump’s The issue here for him , which is clear , is that this is a country Trump’s trouble . This is a country where the economy and foreign policy are in trouble this And she represents   —    for a country that sees , by vast majorities , that the political class in Washington is corrupt , and rigging the system for themselves , that has not yet come center place , " he said vast majorities   " What they ’re trying to do is disqualify him from the Presidency . He vast majorities to now go back to saying he ‘ Hey , wait he minute , what kind of country do you want to continue to have ? The one that is , inevitably , slowly before our eyes , declining and not succeeding ? Or do you want to take a chance on making things better ? I can help you make things better.’ He has not engaged that . The minute he engages , this election he change amazingly , " Caddell predicted . he She is locked in to what she is , " he said of Clinton . " All she can She is put up he , or throw up arguments , She Trump . Trump is the independent variable in this equation . He is the one Trump can force those things that matter to people Trump the front . That is what a change election is about . " Bannon suggested that " the general population does n’t know this is a change election , " with so much attention focused on the clash of personalities , and Trump ’s negative qualities . Caddell faulted Trump and his campaign for lacking Trump preparation and discipline to impose their Trump narrative Trump Caddell recalled working for Jimmy Carter ’s reelection campaign in 1980 , when Caddell we had Reagan defined as a very risky and dangerous person , " but the outcome was " the only election that went in close and came out big , " in Reagan ’s favor .   " It was because the people finally said Reagan Well , he ’s okay . He ’s enough okay . Boy , we ’re really ‘ about the economy ‘ and the hostages , whatever.’ That ’s what we have in this election now , " said Caddell . " The problem we the Trump campaign is , they have not forced that definition   —    which , by the way the Trump campaign events and attitudes are so much worse than they were 35 years ago   …      they do believe that she is events and attitudes , and that she represents   — events and attitudes she is the epitome , she is the epicenter she the political class , she capitalism , and the she it works . "   " That they have not challenged that more specifically is the reason this campaign is off , because the press and the Democrats , particularly the press   —    whatever Trump says , they will find something to start trying to knock him down , " he they . Bannon advised Trump to prepare himself for even worse treatment from him press , if he Trump find a Bannon to close his polling deficit against Clinton   — Bannon an eventuality Bannon described as a Bannon miracle , " while Caddell thought it was highly Bannon . " He will close this gap . He will , " Caddell predicted . " Bannon I ’ll tell you , Bannon ’re right about Caddell media . So , therefore , what do you do about that ? You must take it to the level of not whining about the media . It ’s not about whining . It is about that they the media a detailed role , and a conscious role It in terms of protecting the political class , because they are the political class . " He cited polling data that showed the American they have lost faith in the media they are the political class arguing that "   of them believe their level of objectivity and bias is as high as ever   — the American people they the American people the lowest they ’ve ever been , in Gallup . " " They the American people to be challenged the American people , " he said of the press . " the American people what they ’re trying to do . they are the political class ’re not trying just to knock Trump off the American people They need to suppress that the American people they have not been able to do all year the American people this rebellion out in the the American people , in both parties   —    whether it ’s the Democrats’ revolt with Sanders , the Republican revolt with Trump   —    to suppress this instinct of the American people , to take Trump of their country . "   " That ’s the issue : who runs America ? " the American people declared . " And I ’ll tell you , when you start elevating to those seminal issues , then you have a campaign in which people will be fully engaged . They ’re going to discount a lot of the attacks . " Caddell concluded by striving people make one thing clear to the Breitbart News Daily audience : Caddell If it were n’t Trump , if Trump were somebody else , the nicest person in the world or whatever , they would Trump doing the same thing to that person , because that person represents a people to their power , and their prestige , and their positions that person they will try to people on to those people all costs . people ’s why you people n’t just get fooled by the way they try to turn the microscope up .
