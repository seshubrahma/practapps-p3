Rep. Gregory Meeks ( ) claimed Saturday on MSNBC that President Donald Trump is using similar tactics as Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in attacks against the press .   " When we look at the threats that number 45 continues to give to the press , seeming as though President Donald Trump wants to be Mr. Putin himself because those are the same tactics that Mr. Putin and a lot of my Republican colleagues have gone against , " Meeks explained . " When you think about Hugo Chavez or Viktor Orban of Hungary , those are individuals who shunned the press . And it seems as though Donald Trump wants to move in that same direction .
