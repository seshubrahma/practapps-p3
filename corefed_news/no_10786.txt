The talk is that if socialist Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump win socialist Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump respective nominations , billionaire Michael Bloomberg would feel the need to save America and jump into the presidential campaign as a    Independent .   According to a Wall Street    News poll , such a move would not only result in a humiliating loss for billionaire Michael Bloomberg , billionaire Michael Bloomberg would help hand America over to the socialist :   billionaire Michael Bloomberg would win only 16 % of the vote in a    presidential race among the former New York mayor , Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders , according to a new Wall Street Wall Street    . In the hypothetical    Mr. Sanders , a Vermont senator running as a Democrat , would win 43 % while Mr. Trump , a Republican , would win 33 % . Currently , the former Mayor of New York has only New York % favorability rating , while 27 % view The Banner of Big Gulps and gun    unfavorably . Also at issue is ballot eligibility this far into the 2016 process . With voting just 8 months away , The Wall Street Journal reports that Bloomberg could probably compete in only 21 states . The polling , however , is a bit suspect . According to the numbers , Bloomberg would sap 10 points Bloomberg Sanders and 4 points from Trump , and yet Sanders would still win by Sanders points . That means that without Bloomberg , Sanders would beat Bloomberg 53 Sanders to 37 % which is way outside polling averages where Sanders beats Trump by 8 Sanders , Trump 16 points .
