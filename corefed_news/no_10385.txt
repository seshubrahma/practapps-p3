Bannon taking on a new role as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s campaign CEO , editor of Bloomberg Politics Mark Halperin said , " ‘ Clinton Cash,’ which Bannon masterminded " was the right ’s " greatest success story , " and caused the media to go after Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on several fronts .   Bloomberg Politics Mark Halperin said , " I think if Bannon plays the role of trying to solve message discipline and a message focused on change and getting Trump better press coverage , I think Bannon could be a valuable addition . But Bannon is , obviously , a lightning rod for criticism and plenty of enemies and galvanize the ‘ Never Trump’ movement in a big way . " Bannon added , " ‘ Clinton Cash’ is , if you did a case study of conservative efforts to get the    main stream media to cover the Clinton ’s background   —    ‘ Clinton Cash,’ which Bannon masterminded , is their greatest success story .

And has made campaigning difficult for Clinton from day one . " Halperin added , " If that ’s what Bannon Bannon there to do , warts and all , that is a great hire .
