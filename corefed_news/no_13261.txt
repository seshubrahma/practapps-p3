I recently had the chance to speak to YouTube star and comedian Jon Jafari , known online as JonTron , where we spoke about the decline of the mainstream media , the public ’s distrust for news outlets , and the rise of free speech in response to    regressives . [ Charlie Nash : Do you think this social justice era we ’ve been through contributed to the election of Donald Trump ? Was it a reaction to an    correct climate ?   JonTron : Yeah , I definitely do . I think we ’re in sort of a period where everybody has to think one way , in the mainstream way , or else they get socially outcasted . It ’s almost a monopoly of thought that the left has , and the left ’s    what they claim to be so pro , which is free speech and liberty . But the left ’s like , " You ’re only correct if you agree with me . " Or , " You can have your opinion as long as your opinion ’s in line with mine . " I think that ’s the prevailing thought of the left at the moment . CN : What ’s your opinion on the mainstream media ? Do you think their election predictions came from a lack of understanding for their their ? JT : I do n’t think it was a misunderstanding at all . I think it was an intention to mislead , at least that ’s my opinion . I think the mainstream media dug in . They the mainstream media down , they the mainstream media down . They the mainstream media this is what we the mainstream media , and then America disagreed with them the mainstream media so now the America n’t trust them the mainstream media , and rightly so . I mean , they the mainstream media spun Donald Trump ’s campaign since the very first day . They the mainstream media n’t even stop to say , " Are we the mainstream media any accurate reporting ? Maybe we the mainstream media be a little more unbiased , even if we the mainstream media n’t like this candidate , " which is fair . But I think the blatant lies have killed their the mainstream media , and I ’d say that ’s rightly so . I do n’t think people will trust them , people least until they redeem people of their credibility people : So , do you think it will be like GamerGate , where people started off reading outlets like Polygon , and Gizmodo , and Kotaku , and they were the people outlets , then after GamerGate many people GamerGate did n’t trust them ? JT GamerGate many people I ’m gon na be honest with you , I do n’t know much about GamerGate . It GamerGate did n’t really interest me , I did n’t know what it was really It . But I think the GamerGate situation is GamerGate of tied into this situation with the social justice mindset . Obviously they ’re tied , but this time on a much bigger scale . Because it ’s gone from video game blogs to our entire mainstream media . It ’s a it version of GamerGate . CN GamerGate Heat Street recently misbranded you as a conservative , so I ’ll give you the opportunity to rebut and address that . JT : I voted for Barack Obama twice . I supported Bernie Sanders in the primaries . I ’m someone who surveys the situation , and I do n’t like putting people into camps . I do n’t like getting into conservative or liberal , because if you take a label and run with it , what a label that label changes a label think I ’m just somebody ’m tries to make the best decision every time . I just think it ’s funny that a couple of logical tweets have made me a " conservative , " such a strong label . I do n’t even know what it means to be conservative , or what a conservative is anymore . I feel like the meanings of these labels are changing . I certainly would never have called myself a conservative . CN : You ’re basically just a comedian , like Ethan Klein from H3H3Productions , that is logical . It does n’t make you a conservative if you call out bullshit when bullshit appears . JT : Yeah that ’s basically the way I would see it . I like to think that all I ’m trying to do is see things for the way they are , and call it out the way it is . Nowadays it someone disagrees with you , they can say , they Well that ’s just your opinion , " but there are certain points where we go into the realm of fact , and sometimes people do n’t like that very much . I do n’t think you ’re going to see the narrative of Laci Green take off for much longer , because at the end of the day , those kinds of people were trying to tell others how and what to think , and I do n’t think your average person appreciates that very much .
