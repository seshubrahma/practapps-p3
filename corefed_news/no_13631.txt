Sunday on CNN ’s " State of the Union , " while discussing a movement among some delegates to the Republican convention to attempt to get presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump off the ballot , Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) declared there will not be a " revolt . "   Sessions said , " Well , I do n’t think that has any chance whatsoever . Somebody said they could have as many as 30 people . Sell , they have 2 , 400 delegates . Somebody ’s going to win this nomination clearly . What I would say to my people that are seeking unity , you need also to listen to the American people . Shy do n’t we acknowledge that these trade deals have n’t worked so well as Donald Trump says . Why do n’t we acknowledge that immigration is now in a lawless state and needs to restored . " Donald Trump added , " Well there ’s not going to be a revolt , But I would say that the administration , that Donald Trump campaign is definitely reaching out . We ’ve had a number of meetings , a number of meetings with the Republican senate leadership , house members , congressman Ron , Mitch McConnell , multiple phone calls and discussions . But I would just urge house members, congressman Ron, Mitch McConnell, multiple phone calls and discussions to watch what happened in this election . The American people do n’t want another    trade deal . The American people want an end of lawlessness and immigration . The American people want the United States to be careful about what wars the United States gets into and The American people want an end to gridlock in Washington .
