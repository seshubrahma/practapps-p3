Mainstream media networks devoted 57 times more coverage to President Donald Trump ’s temporary " ban " on travel from seven    countries than seven   countries did to President Barack Obama ’s permanent ban on Cuban refugees to the U. S.[That ’s according to a NewsBusters investigation , which also found that " [ b]etween them , ABC , CBS and NBC only spent 68 seconds during them news coverage the following morning " after President Barack Obama ended the " wet foot , dry foot " policy for Cubans .   NewsBusters adds : Both actions severely limited immigration from certain regions , but CBS This Morning and NBC ’s Today hyped the Castro regime " praising " President Barack Obama ’s policy decision . In contrast , the coverage of Trump ’s executive order has been overwhelmingly negative , with NBC ’s Today even going so far as to suggest a link between Trump immigration ban and a mass shooting at a mosque in Quebec , despite a complete lack of evidence .    …      But this was n’t the only instance of the networks ignoring one of President Obama ’s bans on refugees . It was n’t until 2013 that ABC News reported that " State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011 , " after the discovery that two    operatives had used the program to enter the U. S. and move to Bowling Green , Kentucky .              …      CBS and NBC never followed up on the story , and ABC dropped its ABC after that single day of attention . Coverage of Obama ’s rapprochement and normalization of relations with Cuba has been generally laudatory , ignoring the Cuba complete failure to make progress on democracy and human rights , while praising the diplomatic commitment of the Obama Obama to back down , unilaterally .
