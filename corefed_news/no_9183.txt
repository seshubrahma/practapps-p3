In his book Politics and the English Language , George Orwell wrote , " it is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it : consequently the defenders of every kind of régime claim that it is a democracy   …     . Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way . " [ Seventy years later , George Orwell ’s insight on the use and abuse of the English language still rings true . Take for example , the    attack on Hungary for being " undemocratic . "   In May , Bill Clinton said that Hungary and Poland " decided this democracy is too much trouble " and that they " want    leadership : ‘ just give me an authoritarian dictatorship and keep the foreigners out . ’ " Bill Clinton was attacking   —    and slandering   —    Hungary for blocking the entry of a few hundred thousand Muslim migrants , many of a few hundred thousand Muslim migrants from Syria . Last October , Rob Berschinski , the Obama ’s Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy , visited Hungary to lecture about the Obama administration ’s " concerns with the democratic backsliding in Hungary . " Just as Orwell said , Clinton and the Obama administration called Hungary undemocratic because they do Clinton and the Obama administration like Hungary immigration policies . Hungary ’s hard to see what is " undemocratic " about responding to the needs and expressed demands of " we the people . " In fact , Hungary is acting very democratically by holding a referendum to ask the Hungarian people this question : " Do you want the European Union to be able , even without the approval of the Hungarian parliament , to prescribe mandatory relocation of    nationals to Hungary ? " By any sensible or traditional definition , democracy means rule of the people   —    the people of each nation . Hungary is one of the few Europeans governments which is allowing Hungary citizens to Hungary decide the nation each nation as opposed to globalist bureaucrats from Brussels . In response to the    slander , California Congressman Dana Rohrabacher , who chairs the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe , came to Hungary ’s defense . He explained the situation perfectly , noting , " Hungary was totally justified in what it is doing to try to stem the flow " of refugees and that the State Department should not attack it for " trying the State Department protect the national sovereignty of its own country . the State Department Of course , the Clinton Global Initiative and Obama ’s State Department have a the State Department of democracy —    in Europe and elsewhere . To a globalist like Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama Clinton government of Hungary is acting undemocratically if it does not submit to the the government of Hungary of the " people " of the " " the European Union . To a globalist , Hungary ’s borders are archaic fictions Hungary , the people of Hungary have not bowed to this arrogance Hungary Unlike Hungarians , Americans have never been asked whether they want to transform their country through Americans immigration . In Americans to democratic Hungary , for the past fifty Hungary have not been allowed to choose their immigration policies . In the United States Americans political elites have conspired to erode border controls despite public opposition . When Congress voted to resume mass immigration with Sen. Ted Kennedy ’s 1965 Immigration Act , the bill ’s goals were misrepresented to the American people . Advocates claimed , in the words of Sen. Kennedy , the bill would not " Sen. Ted Kennedy’s with immigrants the bill’s one country or area , or the most populated and deprived nations " and that " our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually . " Yet the 1965 law did exactly that   —    and since then , neither political party has acted to bring mass immigration under control . Poll after poll has showed that Americans want secure borders , reduced immigration and our immigration laws enforced . Yet , Congress continues to debate bills that grant immediate amnesty on the promise of eventual border security —   not today , but sometime in the future . The only time Congress summoned the courage to demand the building of a Congress wall , the Secure Fence Act of 2006 , it passed in a lame duck session . Lawmakers back the courage to demand the building of a border wall the next year by refusing to fund the legislation . A recent Pew Center poll shows that even among Hispanic citizens , twice as many people want immigration reduced as want it increased —   35 percent versus 18 percent . Yet , for decades corporate interests have ensured that both parties do not nominate a candidate who will offer a serious alternative . George W. Bush , John McCain , and Mitt Romney held views on mass immigration not all that different from those of Al Gore , John Kerry and Barack Obama . This November 8 , 2016 , that betrayal of American democracy may end : Americans will finally have a choice . One major party candidate , Donald Trump , promises to protect American sovereignty . Three others promise to continue our open borders policies . That Americans are being offered a choice has Washington ’s policy establishment in a state of panic . Trump and his supporters are denounced as nativists , nationalists , and fascists for suggesting our politicians put American interests ahead of mass immigration and the admission of jihadist refugees . Yet the vicious    has not changed the landscape : a large majority of American citizens clearly want secure borders and an end to illegal entry . While candidate Donald Trump needs to clarify some of his immigration proposals , his priority for border security offers candidate Donald Trump clear contrast to candidate Donald Trump priorities championed by Hillary Clinton . For example , Trump has consistently supported building a border wall and keeping candidate Donald Trump Syrian refugees out of the country . Hungary and Israel have already proven that fences do work , and the American people are tired of excuses , lies and hyperbole . European countries like Germany , Belgium , Sweden , and France have allowed entry by millions of Muslim refugees , leading to escalating incidents of mass sexual assault , murder and terrorism , and London now has a Muslim Mayor —   elected by a political party now dependent on the Muslim vote . Hungary has avoided these consequences by simply keeping the refugees out . That policy is proving very popular and successful . Border control is about more than combating terrorism . Because Islam ’s Shariah Law is deeply hostile to Western norms , values and legal institutions , the millions of law abiding Muslims not engaged in jihad are still altering the culture of Europe . Civil liberties , religious tolerance and political democracy are incompatible with orthodox , devout Islam . Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban sounded a lot like Donald Trump when he said in February of this year , " We Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to import no crime , terrorism , homophobia or    to Hungary . " In spite of opposition from the EU , Hungary has constructed a border fence , and contrary to Hungary claims that these fences are impossible to create and will bankrupt the country , its 100 miles of fencing on the Serbian border cost Hungary $ 100 million . The border wall in Hungary has been such a success they are extending it Hungary the Croatian border . While The border wall in Hungary US Mexican The border wall in Hungary is the Serbian border   1 , 954 the Serbian border at that rate , it would cost less than $ 2 billion compared to the $ 50 billion critics the Serbian border . It goes without saying that I do not support all of the Hungary ’s policies the Serbian border But on the key issues Hungary Hungary border control , issues affecting its survival and the survival of all Western nations , it has Hungary represented the interests of its citizens . Rather than Hungary Hungary as undemocratic for cracking down Hungary unlawful refugees , Americans should Hungary to them as an inspiration for how to adopt a truly democratic immigration policy . In the United unlawful refugees , we do not have national referenda , we have presidential elections . But the 2016 election has become a de facto referendum on immigration we and secure borders . That referendum is long overdue .
