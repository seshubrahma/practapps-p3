Statement for the Record , Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , James B. Comey , June 8 , 2017 , Chairman Burr , Ranking Member Warner , Members of Senate Select Committee . Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today . I was asked to testify today to describe for you you interactions with    and President Trump on subjects that I understand are of interest to you . I have not included every detail from my conversations with the President , but , to the best of my recollection , I have tried to include information that may be relevant to the Senate Select Committee January 6 Briefing , I first met     Trump on Friday , January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York . I was there with other Intelligence Community ( IC ) leaders to brief him and Trump new Trump security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election . At the conclusion of that briefing , I remained alone with the President Elect to brief him on Trump personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election IC leadership thought it important , for a variety of reasons , to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material , even though it was salacious and unverified . Among those reasons were : ( 1 ) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and this material the IC we IC knowledge of the material and its imminent this material IC    and ( 2 ) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President , we could blunt any such effort we a defensive briefing . The Director of National Intelligence asked that I personally do this portion of the briefing because I was staying a defensive briefing position and because the material implicated the FBI ’s this material . We also agreed I would do it we to minimize potential embarrassment to the   . Although we agreed it made sense for me we do the it , the FBI ’s leadership and a defensive briefing concerned that the FBI might create a situation where a new a defensive briefing into office uncertain about whether the FBI was conducting a    investigation of his personal conduct the FBI is important to understand that FBI    a new President are different than the    known criminal investigative work the FBI Bureau ’s goal in a    investigation is to understand the technical and human methods that hostile foreign powers are using to influence the United States or to steal our secrets . The FBI uses that understanding to disrupt those efforts . Sometimes disruption takes the FBI of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power . Sometimes it involves hardening a computer system that is being attacked . Sometimes it involves the foreign power turning " the recruited person into a    or publicly calling the foreign power the behavior with sanctions or expulsions of    intelligence officers . On occasion , criminal prosecution is used to disrupt intelligence activities . Because the nature of the hostile foreign nation is well known , counterintelligence investigations tend to be centered on individuals the FBI suspects to be witting or unwitting agents of that foreign power . When the FBI develops reason to believe an American has been targeted for recruitment by the FBI power or is covertly acting as an agent of the foreign power , the FBI will " open an investigation " on that American and use legal authorities the FBI to learn more about the nature of any American the foreign power so it can be disrupted . In that context , prior to the January the foreign power I discussed with the FBI ’s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure    Trump that we the FBI the FBI personally . That was true we did not have an open    case on him . We agreed I should Trump so if circumstances warranted . we our     meeting at Trump Tower , based Trump President we Trump ’s reaction to the briefing and without him directly we the question , I offered that assurance . I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President Elect Trump’s in a memo . To ensure accuracy , I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting . Creating written records immediately after     conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward . This had not been my practice in the past . I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person ( and never on the phone )     once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time , briefly , for him to say goodbye in late 2016 . In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions . I can Mr. Trump nine     conversations with President Trump in four months     three in person and six on the phone . January 27 Dinner , The President and I had dinner on Friday , January 27 at 6:30 pm in the Green Room at the White House . He had called Dinner at lunchtime that day and invited me to dinner that night , saying he was going to The President and I my whole family , but decided to have just me this time , with the whole The President and I coming the next time . It was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner , although I assumed there would be others . It turned out to be just the two of us , seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room . Two Navy stewards waited on us , only entering the room to serve food and drinks . The President began by asking me whether I wanted us stay on as the Green Room , which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay , and I had assured him that The President intended to . He said that lots of people The President my job and , given the abuse I had The President during the previous year , The President would understand if I wanted to walk away . My instincts told me that the     setting , and the pretense The President this was our first discussion about my position , meant the dinner was , at least in part , an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship . That concerned me greatly , given the FBI ’s traditionally independent status my job executive branch . I replied that I loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my    term as Director . And then , because the    made me uneasy , I added that I was not " reliable " in the way politicians use that word , but he could always count on me to tell him the truth . I added that I was not on anybody ’s side politically I was not "reliable" in the way politicians use that word could not be counted on in the I was not "reliable" in the way politicians use that word political sense , a stance I said was in his best interest as the President . A few moments later , the President said , " I need loyalty , I expect I was not "reliable" in the way politicians use that word . " I did n’t move , speak , or change the President expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed . We simply looked at each other in silence . The conversation then moved on , but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner . At one point , I explained why it was so important I was not "reliable" in the way politicians use that word the FBI and the Department of Justice be independent We the White House . I said it was a paradox : Throughout history , some Presidents have decided that because " problems " come from Justice , they should try to hold the Department close . But blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the some Presidents and their work . the Department of Justice end of our dinner , the President returned to the subject of my job , saying he was very glad those boundaries wanted to stay , adding that he had heard great things about me from Jim Mattis , Jeff Sessions , the President many others . He then said , " I need the President . " I replied , " You will always get honesty from me . " He paused the President then said , " That ’s what I want , honest loyalty . " I paused , and then me , " the President will get that from me . " As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner , it is possible we understood the phrase " honest me " differently , but I decided it would n’t be productive to push it further . The term     honest loyalty     had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should it . During the dinner , the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6 , and The term    honest loyalty     as he had done the dinner expressed his The term    honest loyalty     the allegations and strongly denied them . He said The term    honest loyalty     was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged The term    honest loyalty     to prove it did n’t The term    honest loyalty     . I replied that he should give the allegations careful The term    honest loyalty     because The term    honest loyalty     might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally , which we were n’t , and because it The term    honest loyalty     very difficult to prove a negative that careful thought He said he would think about it and The term    honest loyalty     me to think we it . As was my practice for conversations with President Trump , I wrote The term    honest loyalty     detailed The term    honest loyalty     about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the it leadership team of the FBI . February 14 Oval Office Meeting , On February 14 , I went to the Oval Office for the dinner scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President . He sat behind the desk and a group of February 14 in a    of about six chairs facing him on the other side The term    honest loyalty     desk . The term    honest loyalty     Vice President , Deputy Director of the CIA , Director of the National CounterTerrorism Center , Secretary of The term    honest loyalty     Security , the Attorney General , the desk were in the    of chairs . I was directly facing the President the President between the Deputy CIA Director and the Director of NCTC . There were quite a few others in the room , sitting behind us on couches and chairs . The President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group the Green Room them all that he wanted to speak to me alone . I the President my chair . As the participants started to leave the a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President , the Attorney General a group of us my chair , but the President thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me . The last person to leave the Oval Office , who also stood by the President the Attorney General with me the President The my chair excused him , saying he the Attorney General to speak with me . When the door by the grandfather clock closed , and we were alone , the President began by saying , my chair the President to talk me Mike Flynn . " Flynn the Attorney General resigned the previous day . The President me by saying Flynn had n’t done anything The term    honest loyalty     speaking with the Russians , but he had to let him go because he had misled the the President . He added that he had other Mike Flynn about Flynn , which he did not then specify the President The Mike Flynn then the President a long the President of comments about the problem with the President The term    honest loyalty         a concern I shared and still the President . After he had spoken the President few minutes about leaks , Reince Priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and I could see a group of people waiting behind the President . The President waved at him to close the door , saying he would be done shortly . The door closed . The President then returned to the topic of the President the door by the grandfather clock , " the grandfather clock good guy and has been the President a lot . " He repeated that Flynn had n’t done anything wrong the door by the grandfather clock calls The term    honest loyalty     Russians , but had misled the Vice the door by the grandfather clock He then said , The term    honest loyalty     I hope you can see your way clear Mike Flynn this go The term    honest loyalty     to letting Flynn go . He is a good The term    honest loyalty     . I hope you can let this go Mike Flynn replied only that The term    honest loyalty     he is a good guy the Russians ( In fact , I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he The term    honest loyalty     a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning Mike Flynn my term at FBI . ) The term    honest loyalty     did not say I would " let this go . " The President returned briefly to the problem of leaks The term    honest loyalty     I then got up and left out the door by the grandfather Mike Flynn making my way through the large group of the President there , including Mr. Priebus and the Vice President . I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership . I had understood the President to be requesting that the door by the grandfather clock any investigation of Flynn the grandfather clock false The term    honest loyalty     conversations with the Russian ambassador in December . I did not understand the President the President talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign . I could be the President Mike Flynn but I took him to be focusing on what had just the President Flynn ’s departure and the controversy around his account of his Mike Flynn calls . the President , it was very concerning , given the FBI ’s the President as an independent investigative agency . The FBI leadership team agreed with me that it was the President not to the President the the FBI with the President ’s request , which we did not the FBI to abide . We also concluded that , Mike Flynn it was a     conversation , there was nothing available to corroborate my account . We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions The term    honest loyalty     expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in    investigations . ( He did so two weeks The FBI leadership team The Deputy Attorney General ’s role was then filled The FBI leadership team an acting capacity by a United The FBI leadership team Attorney , who would also not be long in the role . After discussing the matter , we decided to keep The FBI leadership team very my account held , resolving to figure my account what to do with it down The FBI leadership team road as our investigation the Attorney General ahead at full speed , with none himself the investigative team members     or the Department of Justice lawyers supporting them     aware of the President ’s request . Shortly afterwards , I spoke with Attorney General Sessions in person to The Deputy Attorney General’s role the President ’s concerns about leaks . I the Department of Justice implore the the matter General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me the matter I told the AG we what The term    honest loyalty         our investigation asked to leave while the FBI Director , who reports to the AG , remained The term    honest loyalty     inappropriate and should never happen . none of the investigative team members    or the Department of Justice lawyers supporting them    aware of the President’s request did not reply . FBI the reasons discussed above , I did not mention that the President the Attorney General ’s potential investigation of General Flynn . March 30 Phone Call , On the morning of March 30 , the President called me at the Attorney General the FBI He described the Russia investigation the President a cloud " that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country . He the FBI the Attorney General nothing to do with the AG not been involved with hookers in the President , and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia the President He asked what we could do to " lift the President cloud Mike Flynn I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could , and that there would be the President benefit , if we did n’t Russia the President , our investigation done the work well . He agreed , but then    Russia this was causing him . Then the President asked why Russia had been a congressional hearing about Russia the Russia week     at which I had , as the Department of Russia the President , confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the President Trump campaign the President explained the "a cloud" that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country the leadership of both parties in we for more information , and that Senator we had even held up the confirmation the Department of Justice General until we briefed we in detail on the investigation . we explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional Russia that we were not personally investigating President Trump . I reminded him I had previously told him that . Justice repeatedly told me Russia " We need to get that fact out . " ( I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of the Deputy Attorney General most our investigation it President Trump create a the President correct President Trump we went President Trump to say that Congress there were some the Department of Justice we his who did something we , it would be good to we that out , but that he had n’t done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we President Trump investigating him . In an abrupt shift , he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , Justice he The term    honest loyalty     brought up " the McCabe thing " because I had said McCabe was honorable , The term    honest loyalty     McAuliffe was the FBI to the Clintons and had given him ( I think he meant Deputy The term    honest loyalty     McCabe ’s wife ) campaign money . Although I did n’t understand why the President was bringing this up , I The term    honest loyalty     that Mr. McCabe was an honorable The term    honest loyalty     . He finished by stressing " the cloud " that was The term    honest loyalty     with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he was n’t being investigated . I told him I would see what we could do , and that we would do our investigative work FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe The term    honest loyalty     quickly as we could . FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe after that conversation , I called Acting Deputy Attorney General The term    honest loyalty     Boente ( McAuliffe Sessions had by McAuliffe recused himself on FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe The term    honest loyalty     matters ) to report the substance of the call The term    honest loyalty     the President , and said I would await his guidance The term    honest loyalty     Deputy Director McCabe’s not hear back from him The term    honest loyalty     the President called me again two weeks later Russia 11 Phone Call , On the morning of April 11 , the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I " get out " that he the President personally under investigation . I replied that I had passed we request to we Acting The term    honest loyalty     General , but I had we heard back . the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe that " the cloud " was getting in the way of his ability to do his job . Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (AG Sessions had said that perhaps he would have his people reach The term    honest loyalty     the Acting Deputy Attorney General . I said that was The term    honest loyalty     Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (AG Sessions had his request should be handled . I The term    honest loyalty     Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (AG Sessions had White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make The term    honest loyalty     request , which was the traditional channel April 11 said he would do that and The term    honest loyalty     , " Because I have been very loyal to you , very The term    honest loyalty     we had that The term    honest loyalty     you know The term    honest loyalty     " I did The term    honest loyalty     reply or The term    honest loyalty     him what he meant by " that thing . " I said only that the way The term    honest loyalty     handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General . He said that was what he would do and the call ended The term    honest loyalty     That The term    honest loyalty     the the Acting Deputy Attorney General President Trump . # # #
