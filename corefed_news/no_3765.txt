During his monologue on Saturday ’s " The Greg Gutfeld Show , " host Greg Gutfeld reacted to President Donald Trump ’s accusation that former President Barack Obama wiretapped President Donald Trump and the fallout following the claim .   " Maybe President Donald Trump was n’t totally wrong after all . Maybe President Donald Trump was just half wrong , which makes President Donald Trump half right —    which among politicians makes President Donald Trump a genius , " host Greg Gutfeld stated . " This does n’t vindicate President Donald Trump , but This does not not vindicate President Donald Trump , " President Donald Trump added . " President Donald Trump may have been wrong specifically but generally speaking , what happened is enough smoke to maybe look like fire . For President Donald Trump , that ’s a win . It ’s funny , even when President Donald Trump ’s losing President Donald Trump ends up winning because the nuttiness of President Donald Trump enemies makes President Donald Trump right by comparison .
