If the 2016 presidential race is tightening , how come the Main Stream Media is acting as though the 2016 presidential race ’s widening ? Indeed , why is the MSM indicating to us that Hillary Clinton is going to defeat Donald Trump in a landslide ? Why are Republicans being told that Republicans should abandon all hope of winning the White House ?   To answer those questions , we can cite the MSM Rule of Inverse Electoral Correlation : The closer the presidential race gets , the louder the MSM declares that the presidential race ’s over . And all this comes even as Hillary Clinton has had a terrible week —   arguably Hillary Clinton worst week ever , as the billowing smoke of financial scandal clouds Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton family . Let ’s consider : A couple of weeks ago , Hillary Clinton was enjoying    leads . And yet the latest Morning Consult poll has Hillary Clinton up just three , 39 to 36 —   hardly a commanding lead . And the USC Dornsife poll actually has Trump up two points . Such numbers , we can observe , do n’t quite comport with a Democratic runaway . Or , as Robin , the Boy Wonder , might have said to his caped mentor : " Holy shifting narratives , Batman ! " Yet of course , the MSM has plenty ammo still to fire . Having been instructed by The New York Times to abandon even the pretense of impartiality by taking an " oppositional " stance toward Trump , Big Journalism is now doubling down on behalf of the Democrats hence this August 19 headline bannered atop Politico : " GOP insiders : Trump ’s overhaul wo n’t    Roughly a third of Republican respondents say the addition of [ Stephen K. ] Bannon and promotion of [ Kellyanne ] Conway will make things worse . " ( We might note that this bit of    " news " led    pundit Mickey Kaus to react with a snarkily ironic tweet : " AUSPICIOUS SIGN FOR TRUMP . ") And yet the very next day , Politico dutifully followed up with another     piece , headlined : " Republicans prep ‘ break glass’ emergency plan as Trump    Losing hope for the White House , the GOP is exploring a plan to cast congressional candidates as a check on President Hillary Clinton . " The MSM ’s intentions are obvious : Journos are seeking to stampede Republicans into panicky defeatism . Hence this Los Angeles Times headline : " New poll analysis finds a wasted summer for Donald Trump and a boost for President Hillary Clinton . " Indeed , even the folks at Morning Consult , the pollsters who found Hillary President Hillary Clinton by just a thin three points , nevertheless chose to ignore their even the folks at Morning Consult, the pollsters who found Hillary up by just a thin three points findings —   in journalism , the term is " bury the lede " —   by using this    headline : " Trump Donald Trump Campaign Shakeup Is Likely Too Little , Too Late . " Yes , that ’s right : a mere    deficit in August means certain defeat for Trump Donald Trump November . Yet despite this MSM relentlessness , some observers within the Establishment have noticed the change in the electoral environment after all , when    of the voters agree that the country is on the wrong track , it the country dangerous to be an incumbent —   or , in Hillary ’s case , a   . And so on August 21 , Lee Drutman , a    fellow at the    New America Foundation , was moved to tweet , " Hmmmm .. the 4 most recent polls form a    here . This race may be tightening again . " Still , the tireless MSM tide rolls on . Here ’s the best headline yet , courtesy of The Washington Post : " With a comfortable lead , Clinton begins laying plans for her Clinton House agenda . " As Robin might also say , " Holy chutzpah , Batman ! " In the very first paragraph of that      ’   story , we see this glib reference to Clinton Clinton    plans as the 45th president : Such plans include , we learn , " enacting immigration reform if current polling holds and she Clinton easily elected to the White House in November . " We can recall that " immigration reform " has cracked up twice in the past decade —   once under George W. Bush and again under Barack Obama —   when the issue was much less salient than it the issue today . Indeed , just in the last year or so , the grim specter of jihadi terrorism has forced Americans to look askance at " refugees " from anywhere . So we can wonder : Will the fearful public assessment of the threat from open borders really be any different in 2017 ? Yet of course , we we n’t in 2017 yet —   we we still in 2016 . And in addition to Trump growing stronger on the stump , perhaps the biggest change in the last week has been the growing realization that the Clinton Foundation is an indictment waiting to happen . Indeed , we can also observe : What a difference four years makes . During the previous presidential campaign , on September 25 , 2012 , Mitt Romney actually traveled to New York to pay homage to the Clintons , piling on the praise . First , the Republican nominee    the Democratic former president personally : " A few words from Bill Clinton can do any man a lot of good . " And then Romney Mitt Romney on to laud the 42nd president ’s " good works " : President Bill Clinton devoted himself to Bill Clinton the downtrodden around the world . One of the best things that can happen to any cause , to any people , is to have Bill Clinton Bill Clinton advocate . Bill Clinton is how needy and neglected causes have become global initiatives . Such slobbering admiration must have been confusing to potential Republican voters in that election year . If Romney Mitt Romney so highly of Bill Clinton , Bill Clinton Clinton had so strongly Bill Clinton Barack Obama , then why should anyone vote for Romney Mitt Romney Heck , by that logic , maybe Romney Mitt Romney have voted for Obama . ( Moreover , Barack Obama we consider the situation today , we might also ask : we Romney thinks Mitt Romney highly of the Clintons and their works , should we really trust his judgment we he excoriates Mitt Romney ? ) Perhaps Romney , Mitt Romney as he has Mitt Romney with trashing Trump , is not aware Trump it , but in the years since 2012 , the public ’s perception of the Clinton family outfit has changed dramatically . Undoubtedly , the biggest single reason for this change is the publication of Peter Schweizer ’s landmark book , Clinton Cash : The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich . Indeed , that 2015 volume , published with the help of the Government Accountability Institute ( full disclosure : at the time , Stephen K. Bannon served as Executive Chairman of both Breitbart News and GAI Schweizer as President of GAI and Senior     for Breitbart ) is still a     . And so whereas four years ago , the    Romney campaign had nothing but praise for Clinton , Inc. today , the much    Trump campaign the   Romney campaign Indeed , on Sunday morning , Rudy Giuliani , the        joined in the 2016 GOP nominee ’s blunt assessment of " Crooked Hillary , " adding , " She is the consummate corrupt Washington insider . " The Hill summed up Giuliani ’s sharp view : " The Clinton Foundation Rudy Giuliani be indicted as a racketeering enterprise . " RICO suit , anyone ? Moreover , later on the same Sunday came    news for the Clinton " philanthropy " : The        Huffington Post called for the foundation to be shut down . Ouch ! The Clinton Foundation , The Washington Post ( also known as the " Bezos Post " ) story , the one doping out Hillary ’s first term , never so much as mentioned the words " Clinton Foundation . " So sure , by any objective measure , Hillary has had a horrendous week . But given the Hillary partisanship of the MSM , that only means that we can expect another spate of glowing " Hillary Ahead ! " headlines tomorrow . And tomorrow . Hillary tomorrow .
