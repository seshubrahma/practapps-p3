And I remember , on our primary day back in March , there were over 100 , 000 more Republicans that showed up to vote on Republicans side of the ballot than on the Democratic side . And the race over there was pretty much over . It was a big race between Hillary and Bernie . That morning , the majority of the polls showed Hillary ahead of Bernie anywhere from 8 to 20 points in Michigan . 12 hours later Hillary lost to Bernie . I do n’t trust these the polls especially in the upper Midwest , in the Rust Belt . I think people tell the pollsters one thing and they ’re the pollsters another . People have to be busy .    …      You should be out there doing what you can do to get Hillary elected , because every minute counts now , and they are confident the pollsters they ’re going the pollsters pick up enough votes from people who used to have real jobs , and no longer do , and they ’re going the pollsters be out and voting because they ’re angry the pollsters " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
