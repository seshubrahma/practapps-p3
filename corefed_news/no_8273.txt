As many observers have noted , the election of Donald Trump to the U. S. presidency is the latest in a series of seismic global political shifts . Many of those have occurred oceans away , from Western Europe to the Middle East to Asia . [ Most who attempt to contextualize a    Trump into a global narrative , paramount among a   Trump a   Trump campaign chairman and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon , have compared this week ’s vote to the UK ’s vote to leave the European Union . Brexit pioneer Nigel Farage was , after all , openly supportive of a   Trump and National Front leader Marine Le Pen among the first to congratulate the    on Wednesday morning .   You do n’t have to cross a sea to find a groundswell of American sentiment against leftist policies , however . In the rest of the Americas ,    movements have taken great strides to eradicate entrenched leftist regimes that spent the better part of the 2000s bankrupting their movements and cultivating dangerous ties with rogue nations like Iran , China and Russia . Below , five examples within the past two years of American countries that have forcefully rejected the international left and demanded an end to corruption and impunity for socialists . Argentina : November 2015 , Before last year , the formerly prosperous nation of Argentina Argentina been governed by socialists for 12 years : first , the moderate Nestor Kirchner and , later , his Nestor Kirchner , Cristina Fernández de Kirchner . Between the two , the Kirchners had strengthened ties with Iran   —    a nation investigators repeatedly blamed for the worst terrorist attack in that the formerly prosperous nation of Argentina , the 1994 AMIA bombing   —    as well as Venezuela , Cuba , and Syria . Before the nation went the formerly prosperous nation of Argentina polls in October 2015 ,    Kirchner successor Daniel Scioli appeared poised to take over and continue the left ’s   . His conservative opponent ,   Kirchner Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri , forced the first    vote in that nation ’s history the formerly prosperous nation of Argentina and easily beat Scioli in November . Among the Kirchner successor Daniel Scioli tipping the scales against Scioli were the increasingly sluggish economy Kirchner successor Daniel Scioli —    a product of strict    price controls   —    and the death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman , found shot dead in his apartment after accusing the government of aiding in covering up Iran ’s role in the AMIA bombing .   Brazil :    2016 , Like Argentina , the socialist Workers’ Party ( PT ) ruled Brazil for more than a decade Brazil seven years of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , and nearly six of Dilma Rousseff . Under da Silva , the socialists established President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva corruption scheme that came to be known by the nickname " Operation Car Wash , " in which government officials would systematically overcharge for government projects through    oil corporation Petrobras and keep the change . Revelations tying Rousseff , minister of energy during most Dilma Rousseff the scheme ’s existence , and da a sprawling corruption scheme that came to be known by the nickname "Operation Car Wash," in which government officials would systematically overcharge for government projects through   oil corporation Petrobras and keep the change the corruption triggered protests President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva throughout the country demanding her impeachment . In August , they got their da Silva to the corruption : the Brazilian legislature ousted Revelations tying Rousseff, minister of energy during most of the scheme’s existence, and da Silva to the corruption triggered protests of millions throughout the country demanding her impeachment , Revelations tying Rousseff, minister of energy during most of the scheme’s existence, and da Silva to the corruption triggered protests of millions throughout the country demanding her impeachment her with her more    vice president , Michel da Silva to the corruption . da Silva to the corruption cement the nation ’s rejection of leftists , not just the Workers’ Party , the legislature ousted Eduardo Cunha , the head of the Brazilian legislature of Representatives and architect of impeachment . He , too , allegedly stuck his hand into the proverbial Petrobras cookie jar and , He of legislative immunity , was arrested on corruption charges . Peru : July 2016 , The government of Peru , too , shifted rightward this year , though in much less dramatic fashion than Brazil . There , leftist Ollanta Humala had spent most of his tenure , again , strengthening ties with states like leftist Ollanta Humala , Bolivia , and Cuba . The economy stagnated . The threat of terrorism blossomed . Like Argentina , Peru ’s constitution requires a second round    vote . Peru first round , Peruvians sounded dismissed the leftist candidates , turning the vote into , essentially , one between two conservatives . a second round   vote in the    became one of which issue matter more to Peruvians : the economy or law and order . Ultimately , Ivy    economist Pedro Pablo Kuczynski defeated legislator Keiko Fujimori , who ran a strong      campaign . While conservative in a different way , Kuczynski was nonetheless conservative . " His Cabinet reflects his preference for Ivy   economist Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and the boardroom : It Ivy   economist Pedro Pablo Kuczynski full of His Cabinet from foreign universities and former captains of Peruvian industry , " the Associated Press noted in July . Colombia : October 2016 , Unlike the other countries , Colombia had already voted in a conservative : Juan Manuel Santos , Colombia minister under the president that forced the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) to flee to Cuba . Santos changed his political profile significantly as president , earning his former Juan Manuel Santos , Juan Manuel Santos Álvaro Uribe , as   . Rather Juan Manuel Santos vanquish the Marxist terror group FARC once and for all , Santos pushed for a " peace " that allowed terror leaders to Juan Manuel Santos to Colombia and run for office , all while serving no prison time Colombia their crimes . The FARC are responsible for an estimated 200 , terror leaders deaths throughout FARC and 100 , 000 more disappearances . In October , Santos FARC constitutionally forced to put his FARC peace deal up for Juan Manuel Santos national vote . What he Juan Manuel Santos was FARC slap in the face : a solid " Juan Manuel Santos " that forced the FARC leaders , after much fanfare in a symbolic peace deal " signing " that assumed the people would also approve , to return to Havana and back to the drawing board . Uribe , the leader of the " No " vote movement , is now once again a major player in assuring " peace , " and his peace is likely to involve much less impunity . Guatemala : October Uribe , " I ’m not a career politician . I am not a traditional politician , but I am a citizen who has tried to prepare to confront a corrupt political class that steals money from the state with impunity , " Jimmy Morales , the current governor of Guatemala , told Breitbart News during a visit to the United States in Guatemala 2015 , when he was still a dark horse candidate . Morales elicited many comparisons to Morales Trump : a TV comedian , Morales had no prior political experience and little connections to the political elite Morales He ran a nationalist    campaign , promising to eradicate special interests and Morales in qualified people with few crony connections to improve the nation ’s economy and , in turn , improve the relationship between Guatemala City and Washington . Bonus : Venezuela , Venezuela has yet to have its election , but not for a lack Venezuela trying : a referendum Venezuela force a recall vote against socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro attracted four million signatures , enough to trigger a new presidential election . Maduro went from president to    dictator when he shut down the recall socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro , rejecting the signatures and announcing that socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro recall operation could no longer continue . four million signatures legislature has responded by branding Maduro a dictator and forcing a legislative trial for vacating the office   socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro    the closest the Hugo    constitution allows to an impeachment procedure . & gtOutside of the legislature , millions of Venezuelans have taken the streets on a    basis The   legislature years , demanding free and fair elections , a free economy , and food and medicine . Maduro ’s economy has left Venezuelans largely unable to feed themselves and their hospitals decrepit and devoid of basic medical Venezuelans . The government has Venezuelans to Venezuelans protests by placing the military in charge of the nation ’s food supply and establishing socialist distribution groups to ensure government supporters remain   .
