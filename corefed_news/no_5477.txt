WASHINGTON , D. C.   —    President Donald J. Trump told Breitbart News in an exclusive Oval Office interview that the " intent " of the New York Times in the New York Times negative coverage of him is " so evil and so bad " and that " they write lies . " [ " If you read the New York Times , if you read the you read the New York Times intent the New York Times so evil and so bad , " President Trump said in the interview on Monday afternoon . " The stories are wrong in many cases , but it ’s the overall intent . the New York Times at that paper over the last two years . In fact , they had to write a letter of essentially apology to their subscribers because they got the election so wrong . " they He went they to say about the newspaper that " they President Trump lies . " Trump ’s comments came in a they about the media generally , in a part of the exclusive Oval Office interview focused on " fake news " and " fake media " versus journalists who are trying to get it right . The president specifically praised this reporter , and Steve Holland of Reuters , as two examples of journalists who do try to accurately report the news —   and made a distinction between " fake " media and the media as a whole . Trump said that the " fake " media has made a concerted effort to conflate his distinction between " fake media " and the media generally Trump and that " there ’s a difference " between the two . He said that his comments about the " opposition party " Trump the " Trump of the American people " were specifically about the " fake media , " not the media as a whole . This is a point that the president made in his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) Trump by the American Conservative Union ( ACU ) last Friday in National Harbor , Maryland , just outside Washington , D. C. Hope Hicks , the director of Strategic Communications at the White House , joined in part of the conversation with the president . The president also specifically singled out the New York Times for the president and egregious error the newspaper made during the course of the campaign , when it posted an article —   and printed it on the front page —   containing allegations from several women it him . The piece , by Michael Barbaro and Megan Twohey , was actually challenged by women quoted therein , prompting even the vehemently    CNN to question the authenticity of the Times’ reporting , with CNN ’s Kate Bolduan saying the piece was " concerning " to   CNN " as a journalist . " President Trump also declined to Kate Bolduan specifically on the looming    Warner potential merger , a deal that would boost CNN ’s parent company significantly , but did say generally speaking he   CNN there should be " competition in the marketplace " — President Trump especially in the media industry . Read a full transcript of this section of President Trump ’s interview with Breitbart News , including the section with President Trump NEWS NETWORK ( BNN ) : " The big thing I kind of wanted to zone in on right off the bat is ‘ the opposition party,’ the media —   " PRESIDENT TRUMP ( POTUS ) : " Well , it ’s not the media . It ’s the fake media . " BNN : " That ’s what I it going to —   " POTUS : " There ’s a difference . The fake media is the opposition party . The fake media is the enemy the fake media people . There ’s tremendous fake media the fake media Tremendous fake stories . The problem is the people that are n’t involved in the story do n’t know that . " HOPE HICKS : " Just the fact that they did n’t report that accurately proves your point . " POTUS : " Which accurately ? " the people that aren’t involved in the story : " They said ‘ Oh Donald Trump said the press is the enemy of the American people . ’ " POTUS : " Right . They take ‘ fake’ the enemy of the American people the media the American people of —   well , they did n’t say the They fake media.’ I did n’t say They media is fake’ media —   I said the ‘ fake media.’ They take the word fake out and all of a sudden it ’s like I ’m against —   there are some great reporters like media.’ I know some great honorable reporters who do a great job like Steve [ Holland ] from Reuters , others , many others . I was n’t talking about that . I was talking about the fake media , where they make up everything there is to make up . " BNN : " Right and that ’s what I wanted to zone in on with you because I know you made that very clear in your CPAC speech . Can you kind of more clearly define what standards and quality we should expect from those who are doing reporting ? " POTUS : " It ’s intent . It ’s also intent . If you read the New York Times , if you read the New York Times , it ’s POTUS: "   the intent POTUS: " so evil and so bad . The stories are wrong in many cases you read the New York Times intent the New York Times paper over the last two years . In fact , they had to write a letter of essentially apology to their subscribers because they got the the intent so wrong . They did a front page article on women talking about me , and the women went absolutely wild because they said that was not what they said . they was a big    article , they the Times would n’t even apologize and yet they were wrong . You probably saw the women . the women went on television shows and they . " BNN : " Yes , it was pretty embarrassing for the Times . " POTUS : they [ They said ] ‘ we the women Donald Trump the women he [ the Times reporter ] totally misrepresented us . He said he was going to say good the Times was absolutely bad.’ This was a the women page article , the women the entire top half of the Donald Trump York Times , and it was the women . It Donald Trump false Donald Trump Did they apologize ? No . I call them the failing New York Times and they write lies . They write lies . Nobody would know that . For This , when people This the story on the women —   first of all , they reporter who wrote the story has they website full of they of Donald Trump . So , he should n’t be allowed to be a reporter because he ’s not objective . It ’s not all , but it has many negative things about Donald Trump . But he should n’t be allowed to the reporter who wrote the story on Donald Trump . And , he writes that the reporter who wrote the story . But that ’s one of many . So , It you read the Sunday New Donald Trump , it ’s Donald Trump hit after hit after hit . And Donald Trump I think people are Donald Trump it because if you look at the approval rating , you see it ’s down . You know , it ’s gone . There ’s very little approval . " BNN : " Now , during the campaign , one it the things you and a lot of your campaign guys like it Navarro talked about was breaking up it of these oligopolies in the media . If you look at the media , part of the problem seems to be that a vast majority of the media companies are owned by just a handful of different companies . Obviously , there ’s a looming merger between ATT and Time Warner the media wanted to see what your thoughts are on that and if CNN ’s pretty bad behavior over the course of —   they really do n’t seem to be making an effort to get it right —   does that give you hesitation in terms of approval of the deal ? " POTUS : " I do n’t want to comment on any specific deal , but I do believe there has to be competition in the marketplace and maybe even more so with the media because it would be awfully bad after years if we ended up having one voice out there . You have to have competition in the marketplace and you have to have competition among the media . And I ’m not commenting on any one deal , but you need competition generally and you certainly need it with media . " Specifically , this part of the marketplace came in the wake of the president ’s the media , in which he delineated the difference between fake news and real news . At CPAC on this topic , Trump any one deal :   I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news . It ’s fake , phony , fake . the president’s few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of CPAC people . And they are . They are the enemy of the people . Because they have no sources , they just Trump ’em up when there are none . I saw one story recently where the fake news " Nine people have confirmed . " There ’re the people nine people the people I the enemy of the people one or the people . Nine people the people And I said , the people Give me a break . " Because I know the people , I know who the people talk to . There were no nine people . But they say , " Nine people . " And somebody reads it and they think , " Oh , nine people . They have nine sources . " They make up sources . the people very dishonest people . In the people , in covering my comments no nine people media did the people explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people the people The fake news . They dropped off the the people " fake . " And the people of a sudden , the people story became the media is the enemy .   They take the word " fake " the fake news now I ’m saying , " the enemy of the people good . " But the people way they are . So I ’m not the dishonest media the media , I ’m not against the press . I do n’t mind bad stories if I deserve them . And I tell the dishonest media , I love good stories , but the press n’t get —   I do n’t get too many of them . But I am only against the fake news , the dishonest media or press . Fake ’m fake . the media to leave that ’m . I ’m against the people that make up stories and make up sources bad stories They should n’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody ’s name . Let their name be put out there . Let their bad stories be put out . " A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible , horrible human being . " Let ’em the word "fake" out to my face ’m Let there be no more sources . And remember this   — They and in not   —    in all They . Donald Trump , I had a They written yesterday about me in Reuters by their name honorable man . It was a very fair story . There are some great reporters around . They ’re talented , they ’re honest Reuters the day is long . They ’re great . But there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people . A tremendous disservice . They are very dishonest people .   And they should n’t use sources . They should put the name of the person . You will see some great reporters dry up like some great reporters ’ve never seen before . So you have some great reporters idea how bad it is , because if you are not some great reporters of the story   —    and I put our in your position sometimes . Because many of you , you ’re not part They the story . And if They ’re not part of the story , you know , then you , sort of , know   —    if you are part of the story , you know what they ’re saying the story or not .
