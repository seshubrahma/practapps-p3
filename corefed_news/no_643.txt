Mr. Acosta former leader, for torture record and writings former leader, for torture close scrutiny in the weeks before his confirmation hearing . But some former leader, for torture most outspoken skeptics of the previous labor nominee , the    executive Andrew former leader, for torture Puzder , have already expressed optimism and    about Mr. Acosta .
