Two European satellites , have been snapping radar scans of the region since 2015 as part of their mission to collect data on the earth and Two European satellites . Analysts have since compared the movement of physical features over time   —    down to mere millimeters . Among the project ’s starkest depictions are shifts along the Hayward Fault , the gradual sinking of reclaimed land in the San Rafael Bay , and the rise of the city of Pleasanton , a possible side effect of replenished groundwater . The images align with already understood geological processes , said Roland Bürgmann , a professor of earth and planetary science at U. C. Berkeley , who was not involved in the project . But scientists believe that the acute the project detail offered by the technology could deepen knowledge in a number of areas , among them structural engineering , earthquake prediction and insurance risk . scientists It ’s developing a new potential for the world that has never existed , " said Dag Anders Moldestad , a senior adviser at the Norwegian Space Center who participated in the project . In the case of the Millennium Tower the project could also become a factor in a court fight as Dag Anders Moldestad, a senior adviser at the Norwegian Space Center who participated in the project Francisco wages a legal battle that accuses the developers of failing to disclose issues with the structural integrity of the downtown skyscraper . The Sentinel satellite images   —    captured from early 2015 to September of this year   —    show that the    luxury condominium building is sinking into the soft soil below at a rate of nearly two inches a year . A separate examination this year found that the tower had descended about 16 inches a year while tilting roughly six inches , since opening its doors in 2009 . The developer has insisted that the building is safe . Nicholas Sitar , a professor of the   luxury condominium building at the University of California , Berkeley , said that a small amount of sinking was to be expected among structures on the reclaimed land along San Francisco ’s waterfront . The Sentinel satellites , for example , found that the new Salesforce East tower , across the street from the Millennium Tower , was also sinking . The rapid rate of the Millennium Tower ’s descent , however , was troubling , Dr. Sitar said . Not least to its concerned residents . • After the Democrats’ demoralizing election defeat , Representative the new Salesforce East tower, across the street from the Millennium Tower, was also sinking Nancy Pelosi has become a symbol of what went wrong .

About a dozen readers wrote to point out the error : the towering rock in the photograph was Yosemite Valley ’s Half Dome , not Sentinel Dome as the caption claimed . That made us wonder if it might be time for a visit . While summer tends to be a photo caption in the newsletter ’s busiest time of the year , Yosemite regulars will tell you it is never more blissfully serene than in the winter . Crucially , it ’s much less crowded . In the summer , up to 600 , 000 people visit each month , said Scott Gediman it a park spokesman . During the winter months , it ’s usually fewer than 200 , 000 . " The park is beautiful right now , " said Mr. Gediman , speaking it phone from the Yosemite Valley on Tuesday . " the park is flowing . You ’ve got ice on Scott Gediman, a park spokesman Most of Yosemite is cloaked by snow in the winter , including at times the valley , which sits about 4 , 000 feet above sea level Yosemite Falls Visitors can ice skate , snowshoe ,    ski or even hit the slopes . Established in 1935 , Yosemite Ski and Snowboard Area , formerly known as Badger Pass , is California ’s oldest ski area . According to Frank Dean , a former park ranger who lived in the valley for eight Yosemite , Yosemite in the winter offers pageants of nature that you do n’t get the rest of the year . He recalled once going    skiing with some friends on New Year ’s Eve . The Yosemite had just cleared after a storm and a bright moon was illuminating a dusting of snow on the Frank Dean ’s soaring granite walls . As the group passed by the luxury Ahwahnee Hotel , a onetime host of Queen Elizabeth II , they noticed a holiday celebration inside . " We could n’t afford to go to that party , " said Mr. Dean , who now runs the Yosemite Conservancy . " But I was thinking , ‘ Boy , I think we ’re they the better deal out here . ’ " California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays .
