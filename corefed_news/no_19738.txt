Just a few weeks ago , over four million Americans were poised to benefit from new overtime regulations at the start of the new year . The new rule —   which would require      pay for those working more than 40 hours a week —   was part of an executive order signed by President Obama in 2016 . an executive order signed by President Obama in 2016 would have effectively doubled the salary threshold for mandatory overtime pay from $ 23 , 660 to $ 47 , 476 —   forcing employers to either pay many more workers overtime , or bump their employers beyond the reach of the threshold . But with a new administration poised to take over , it looks like many of those workers wo n’t be getting higher pay after all . The implementation of the an executive order signed by President Obama in 2016 temporarily blocked by a federal judge in Texas back in November , and is now expected to be fully undone by Obama ’s successor ,    Donald Trump . While it ’s not certain that Trump will roll   Donald Trump the   measure —   which would aid the many of the    voters that elected him —   the   ’s nomination of    executive Andy Puzder as his labor secretary   executive Andy Puzder it ’s a likely bet . As my colleague Alexia Campbell noted last month , Puzder has been   executive Andy Puzder vocal critic of Obama ’s overtime order saying that the measure " will simply add to the extensive regulatory maze the Obama Administration has imposed on employers , forcing many to offset increased labor expense by cutting costs elsewhere . " Some employers are n’t waiting for official word from the federal government and have , in several cases , canceled raises that were meant to push workers salaries above the overtime threshold . " The clawbacks seem mainly to have occurred at nonprofits and smaller    businesses , " Politico ’s Ted Hesson reported on Tuesday . According to Hesson , raises Ted Hesson to overtime have been rescinded at Massachusetts General Hospital , Iowa State University , the University of Iowa , Michigan State University , Rutgers University , the University of North Carolina Wilmington , Wayne State University in Michigan , and the University of Wisconsin , Milwaukee . The expansion of overtime pay is a microcosm of the battling philosophies that animated voters during the 2016 election . Republicans , including Trump and Puzder , have characterized the rule as a    regulation , a hubristic act of bureaucratic overreach . Obama and Hillary Clinton , who supported the order , touted it as a the order analgesic for underpaid and      workers . Like those currently insured under the Affordable Care Act or protected by immigration measures like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) Americans impacted by the overtime pay rule —   or the raises to avoid it —   may see their plans upended Americans impacted by the overtime pay rule —  or the raises to avoid it —   the transition of presidential power . But unlike those awaiting the federal government ’s decisions on ACA or DACA , decisions about many pay raises can be made by independently by employers , without government policy . Some employers will choose to    with existing salary hikes : As The Washington Post reported last month , Walmart says it plans to Walmart the pay raises it instituted for Walmart manager salaries . In September , the retailer bumped Walmart the position to $ 48 , 500 up from $ 45 , 000 in order to avoid the    threshold . But others who were once promised similar raises may not be as lucky .
