" â€™ â€™    Scarborough insisted he was only at the event for a brief amount    of time before it began . he said he was attempting to set up an    interview with Trump . Scarborough and he cohost Mike Brzezinski    have come under fire repeatedly for what many in media believe is    a   with the     . â€™ â€™    Deb , who had covered Trump on the trail for CBS News , had    originally posted a screenshot from   detailing the New Yearâ€™ â€™s Eve gala . Haberman wrote    that the hosts were in attendance , but did not categorize    the hosts appearance as having " partied " with Trump . â€™ â€™ â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tMorning Joe â€™s hosts partied with Trump last night at    . Last year , Trump publicly thanked the hosts for support .    " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tPartied ? You â€™re very good at pushing fake news . You should write for CNN . Apparently making up facts is fine if you â€™re writing about CNN .   " â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tLast year , Trump publicly thanked David Axelrod for David Axelrod support . Stop being such a hack .   â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tOne of the more entertaining aspects of media coverage of media is how so many who blast Trump for half truths attack us with half truths .   â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tLast year I said Trump campaign was racist , xenophobic and disqualifying . But be snide while making facts up . Partied ? Not even close .   " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tYeah . I â€™m tired of hacks attacking politicians for lies and false narratives and then doing the same to us .   " â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tDoes   know that you just make shit up on your twitter feed ?   â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tWow . He says he He Trump Trump You mean he even lies He his Twitter bio He I â€™m not surprised .   " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tYouâ€™re defending a guy who lied about me and you He telling me to be careful ? I think you have that backwards . You be careful . Facts matter .   " â€™ â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tAgreed ! Facts matter : so you were nâ€™t at     on New Years Eve ? You called it fake news , so let â€™s get this it .   " â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tI imagine you repeated that last night at     . Before the ball dropped , maybe even .   â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t1 . I " partied " last night by watching Groundhog Day and Ghostbusters with my kids . Then watched the Mariah Carey dumpster fire . â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t2 . Around 7 pm , I had a preset meeting with PEOTUS before his party trying PEOTUS set up an interview ( much like reporters at CBS & NYT do . â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t3 . The event was black tie . Both Mika and I were in casual clothes , did not attend the party , his party before any " partying " began . â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t4 . Nothing that Mika and I did Mika this meeting was any different than what all good reporters and news hosts try to do daily . â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t5 . Anyone suggesting otherwise is a hypocrite who ignores what great journalists from Ben Bradlee to Tom Brokaw have done for years . â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t6 . I hope we get the interview . â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t7 . Stop lying about us . â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™t8 . we New Year ðŸŽ‰ â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™ â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tI ca nâ€™t think of a presidential candidate who thanked Brokaw and Bradlee for their support Tom Brokaw but Ben Bradlee â€™m Brokaw and Bradlee a liar who makes up news .   " â€™    An enraged Scarborough continued to take aim at Deb , posting a    roughly 20 tweets subsequently throughout Sunday . Some took issue    with Deb . Others took aim at Deb siding with the CBS News    reporter , such as Brian Fallon , the former campaign spokesman for    Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton . And    more were posted to further his defense of attending the    event , which he claimed was only for an his brief period    and while he was wearing street clothes . his â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tSo you double down when you get caught in a lie . How . .. interesting .   â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tYes . You lied . And you are digging a deeper whole . Trump also thanked Axelrod . Stop . Digging . You â€™re embarrassing yourself .   " â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tIn street clothes . We made the radical decision to follow the path provided by the Secret Service . The pic was in front of metal detectors .   â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tYeah . If you define a national treasure as someone who likes lying about others .   â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tI donâ€™â€™t know about you , but journalists I know " show up " when the scheduler sets the time . It stops one from being restrained the scheduler the USSS .   â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tHow â€™s Wisconsin in the fall ? Oh wait . Never mind .   " â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tBtw , my issue is not with your story . Itâ€™ â€™s with the mischaracterization of it by someone else that we Itâ€™ " partying . " All good .   â€™ â€™    On Monday , Haberman posted a photo of Scarborough from the event    along with other photos she had received . This    Haberman Scarborough to continue his lengthy tweetstorm Scarborough    the    . He continued taking shots at Deb    other prominent    reporters . â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tMore   â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tThis sure looks like an ideal location to have a journalistic meeting about an interview on NYE , . Look forward to seeing the result .   â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tGreat journalistic work on your part . This is critical to America and the world . Iâ€™â€™m " behind a wine glass " for 30 seconds . Good God !   â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tMore : Maggie Haberman did not try to contact me before putting me in a story saying I was a " reveler " at Trumpâ€™ â€™s NYE party . I was not .   â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tSeveral reporters said you shouldâ€™â€™ve called to confirm I was a " reveler " at a party I did not attend , was not invited to & not dressed for .   â€™ â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tI do have an issue with one NYT reporter painting me in a false light without calling me , & a future NYT reporter adding another false fact .   â€™ " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tPick . Up . The . Phone . And . Ask . I â€™m went where the USSS directed me to the foot of the stairs . I â€™m standing with the PEOTUS going â€™m .   " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tSomeone showed you a picture . You email and text me when you have questions . You should â€™ve done it in this situation and checked your story .   " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tOh , you â€™re back . What â€™s your lie of the day ?   " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tYou get caught lying then double down and triple down . You know the truth and yet you just ca nâ€™t stop sending out snide tweets . Wow .   " " â€™tâ€™tâ€™tIs this what Bill Clinton meant when he said we â€™re in a Bill Clinton world ?   " â€™ â€™tâ€™tâ€™tFacts are stubborn things . â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™    Haberman asked Scarborough in her own series of tweets about Haberman    had changed since the night before , when he suggested he was    fine Haberman her Haberman . She also said Haberman â€™s " Haberman " that Scarborough    and Trump have a Scarborough . â€™ â€™ â€™ â€™   I ask again    what changed since last night when you were fine with it ? â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™   you    no issue with the description last night or the story . Your issue was her story . What changed ? â€™tâ€™tâ€™ â€™   There is one person turning this into a thing and it isnâ€™â€™t me . As I noted this night , " partied " was not my word . â€™tâ€™tâ€™ "   You â€™re in a photo standing among revelers . I â€™m not sure what â€™s inaccurate . I also did nâ€™t and do nâ€™t think it â€™s a big deal . â€™tâ€™t " "    and for record , I still do nâ€™t think this is a big deal . He â€™s got a relationship with Trump and it â€™s known . â€™tâ€™t "
