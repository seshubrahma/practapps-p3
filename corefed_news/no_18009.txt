" ’ ’    " That’ ’s up to his personal lawyer , " Spicer That’ . " I Spicer , again ,    each person that goes through the process in government seeks    counsel in many cases regarding    assets they own and the    activities they conducted , as to what they have to do or not they . " ’ ’    Spicer continued : " But Spicer is something that , you know ,    it’ ’s like asking whether someone needed to file , if they have a    client , it’ or not they needed to file a lobbying it’    form . That’ ’s not up for us to determine . That’ ’s up for them and That’ their counsel to determine if they them in activities in the them past or whatever it is , or if a doctor needed to go an up their    certification , that’ ’s them up for the That’ to determine .    There are certain private citizen’    activities that you conduct    and you seek counsel on    professional advice . That’ ’s not up to    That’ government . And that’ ’s the government the system That’ . " ’ "    Fox News’ John ’    n’t raise a    red flag . " ’    Spicer cut him off and said , " You already had your question , John Roberts John . " ’ ’    But Roberts continued . ’ ’    " You have an attorney calling John Roberts transition that the person who    is in line to be the national security adviser may need to    register as a foreign agent , " Roberts said . " And that    doesn’’t raise a red flag John Roberts " ’ ’    " It’ ’s not a question of raising a red flag , John , " Spicer said .    " It’ ’s a question of whether or not they gave them the It’    they’’re supposed to , which is It’ is It’ up to them to make    decisions as to what you need to do It’ not do    As you know , there    are certain activities that fall under each of these requirements       far as what the threshold is , what activities , who the funding    source was , etc . etc . It is not up to , nor is it appropriate , nor    is it legal , for the government to start going in          seeking advice and telling them what they have to    register or not . " ’ ’    them continued : " That would be the equivalent of walking through    someone’ ’s tax return and saying ’’ that’ ’s not a deduction that you    should take , that is . ’’ That’ ’s why when you contact these    agencies , they will tell you you should seek counsel or    professional advice these   agencies expertise in whatever matter it is . That    is not up to them to determine . Plain and simple . " ’ ’    these   agencies reporter then asked a    question , pointing out    that " this was an issue of judgment about who you guys wanted in    your administration . " ’ ’    " There were published reports that your potential national    security adviser had dealings with the government of Turkey , a    controversial regime at this moment in time , " the reporter said .    " Congressman Cummings sent a letter to Mike Pence during the    transition informing him of this and raising a red flag . Mr.    Pence Congressman Cummings on television I believe yesterday saying twice he Mike Pence knowledge of that letter . " ’ ’    Spicer Mr.    in . ’ a letter " Hold on , before you accuse the vice president of certain things ,    know what he said is he was not aware of the filing , " Spicer    said Mr.    " Just Mr.    we’’re clear . And he wasn’’t . Go Spicer " ’ ’    The reporter started again . Mr.    ’    " Just in terms of the larger question Spicer —    forget about filling    out forms and the legalisms here , " he said . " What does this say    about the transition team’ ’s judgement Mr.    still appointing him    as national security adviser when you had knowledge of this    information ? " ’       Spicer said he can’’t " forget about the legalisms . " ’ ’    " What I’’m saying is that’ ’s what we did , " he said . " They consulted    a lawyer , which everyone who had something is advised I’’m do , that    lawyer consulted the transition lawyer who said it is your job to    consult the appropriate    . " ’ ’    The reporter retorted that he was "    about the judgement    that the president , the vice president , and The reporter team made to    select this man as national security adviser when you had    information that he had these dealings with The reporter " ’ "    Spicer responded by listing    ’s qualifications The reporter " ’    " What dealings are you referring to , the fact that he had a    client ? " he said . " He was also the head of the Defense    Intelligence Agency , unbelievably qualified he 40 years in he    military , with impeccable credentials , I mean , so what is it ,    that he , I mean what exactly are you getting at ? Because so far ,    he has he credentials , he had a stellar career in the    military , widely respected       I think for you    start to    impugn his the   military " ’ ’    The reporter interrupted , but Spicer cut him off .    ’    " There was no disclosure at the time , " Spicer said . "    the    question is if his counsel worked with whomever he worked with    and Spicer that he didn’’t , that’ ’s up to him    . .. The burden    is on the individual to seek    legal advice or professional    expertise    decide what they have to file and not . . .. That is    not up to the transition attorney to go the legal advice or professional   expertise someone’ ’s    livelihood and determine what they need to seek . " ’ ’    Another reporter then asked whether the    administration is    concerned someone’’s   livelihood others advising the president might also be    lobbying on behalf of foreign governments . ’ ’    " This is like saying . .. can you tell me that the executives at    NBC News have gone through every single person’ ’s and reporter’ ’s    background ? " Spicer said . " We trust people to fill out the forms    that they are required to do so in an honest and legal manner .    And in this case , he people filed the forms that he was    supposed to do but we    him to do what the    and proper    thing was    that’ ’s the right thing for We administration    " ’ ’    Spicer said the White House expects " every employee to follow the    law " and Trump instituted a    ban on lobbying . ’ ’    " He has ran on a commitment to drain the swamp , " Spicer said . " He    has been very committed to making sure that we institute high    standards here Spicer that we’’re held He them . " ’ ’White House press secretary Sean Spicer got . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
