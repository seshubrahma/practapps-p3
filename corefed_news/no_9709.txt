" [ Continued Former UN Ambassador John Bolton , " Mrs. Smith and her Hillary Clinton and what she Hillary Clinton the other families of the four Americans assassinated that day demonstrates is a failure of character on Hillary Clinton . I really think it comes down to that . You can talk about Donald Trump all you want . Tested in a crisis situation , Hillary ’s character failed Hillary " I think Mrs. Smith makes a very important point . Her son died in the service Mrs. Smith our country working for Hillary Clinton , and she wo n’t even meet with Hillary Clinton to talk about what happened Hillary Clinton And I think the reason why the media does n’t take it seriously is the media is the media to do the media can to elect Hillary , " the media added . Asked if there Her son any chance of Pat Smith getting to the truth , said Bolton , " Not so long as Hillary Clinton is running for president Hillary Clinton ’s for sure . " Bolton continued : This is just total cowardice Bolton Hillary ’s part and I think it Hillary Clinton the fact that she knows , deep inside , she Hillary Clinton that it was her failure Hillary Clinton led to those deaths Hillary Clinton Benghazi . She was Secretary of State , obviously Hillary Clinton was President   —    the buck stops there . But these people worked for her and the line that she has Hillary Clinton   —    ‘ Hillary Clinton had experts to worry about security matters and I did n’t dirty my hands with that sort of stuff’   —    is just absolutely wrong . I ’ve worked for six different Secretaries of State . When they had people in dangerous postings in countries six different Secretaries of State were filled with civil strife , threatened by terrorism , you better believe they worried about the circumstances of their people six different Secretaries of State there . But Hillary was six different Secretaries of State busy doing other things   —    I think primarily running for President   —    and she knows the extent of her failure in Hillary days before the September Hillary attack . She knows her failure that day , as Hillary , her failure everything she could to get help to them . Hillary she knows she ’s failed after help , Hillary . Hillary personally think she ’s just not able to cope with Hillary . Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern . LISTEN :
