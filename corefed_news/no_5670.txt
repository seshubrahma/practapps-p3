Thursday on CNN , Sen. Rand Paul ( ) said the reactions on the left to President Donald Trump ’s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change were " alarmist " and   " ridiculous . "   Sen. Rand Paul said , " We should try to constrain pollution . We should try to control pollution . I think We ’ve been doing that for 50 or 60 years . And I think We should continue . But your previous guest sounded like , my goodness , the sky is falling , mass extinction . Really ? I do n’t think We should be alarmists about this . The planet is 4 . 5 billion years old . We have gone through great extremes of climate change natural and now We may have    influence as well . "   " But these people , the question I always ask the alarmists is how much is nature and how much is man ? " man continued . " these people act as if it ’s a given man is the only source of climate change . My goodness , the great climate changes in our history happened before the industrial revolution . So is there climate change could man have an impact ? Yes , but let ’s not be such alarmists that if we do n’t sign the Paris accord that there ’s going to be mass extinction ? That ’s a ridiculous statement . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
