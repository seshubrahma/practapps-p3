Rick Manning of Americans for Limited Government told Breitbart News Daily that National Review ’s latest cover story attacking America ’s working class communities as places that " deserve to die " is both " fundamentally wrong " and " morally reprehensible . " [ Manning , a respected grassroots conservative leader , spoke with Breitbart Executive Chairman and SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon about the rebuttal of National Review ’s article that he wrote for Breitbart Breitbart Executive   As Bannon SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon , National Review , which published an entire " Against Trump " special issue in January denouncing the GOP frontrunner , has now focused its GOP on Trump ’s supporters in a new issue featuring a cover story by Kevin D. Williamson , which argues that the working class communities these Trump Trump’s represent " deserve to die . " " It is one thing in a political context to say , ‘ We do n’t like this candidate over another candidate.’ That ’s perfectly legitimate , " Manning said . " But in this article , Kevin Williamson , the author , attacks the people who support Trump Trump’s he attacks the people who work for a living . " " It is n’t really about Trump Trump’s you get down to it It " Manning reasoned . " It It about people who feel they ’ve been left behind by an economy where we see our jobs exported overseas , where we see environmentalists shutting down a factory , shutting down the mills , and we see government regulations working against [ us ] . We us as if the government itself is working against us us and the system is all rigged to benefit the people who have lobbyists in DC and against the people who are just trying to make a living and raise their a living and go to church and do all the things we us in our us that do n’t have anything to do with what ’s happening in Washington , DC or state capitals or even our local town halls . And it ’s those people that Kevin Williamson in the National Review article basically said , ‘ It ’s your fault . Stop being a crybaby . Load up your trucks and move to the big city and see what you can do there.’ And it was fundamentally wrong . It was morally reprehensible , and so I felt I had to call him there.’ . " Characterizing the National Review cover story as " stunning and shocking , " Bannon there.’ that the magazine ’s writers " hope for really the implosion , demise , and destruction of white working class communities throughout the country . " When he there.’ saw the article , Bannon there.’ he there.’ , " That ’s got to be a parody . That has to be    . Then I read it , and it it so mean and so vicious that it it of stunned me . " Manning agreed , saying , " People really do need to read the the article it ’s the article vile . It ’s the article    . It ’s the article     elitist that it ’s the article impossible to believe that somebody sat down and wrote it and the article else read it and the article it and the article , ‘ This is suitable for publication . ’ " " And what makes it even worse , " he added , " is it ’s it cover story on National Review . It ’s it cover story ! It ’s it thing they ’re trying to drive people in to read their magazine they And it ’s it in its breadth it in its real it towards people who work for a living . " Williamson ’s article , Manning explained , tells working class Americans that " it ’s their fault working class Americans their communities working class Americans dead . And they should working class Americans walk away from their communities working class Americans walk away from their lives working class Americans and just accept their fate working class Americans " Manning passionately rebutted this notion . " The people who are losing their jobs those people of government regulations like the Endangered Species Act regulations that deal with the spotted owl in the northwest , which destroyed timber communities and created a number of ghost towns all over the northwest the northwest people lost jobs because the federal government decided they wanted those people owl and not those people ’s jobs , " he said . " It ’s not their fault when not those people federal government the federal government down their industries . " He not those people : " It he not the fault It an autoworker whose job gets sent overseas because we ’ve created trade laws which make more sense to have jobs exported than imported . " " And it ’s certainly not the fault of a textile worker in South Carolina or North Carolina who saw their jobs go overseas because it became more efficacious to it the same thing in a Central American country due to CAFTA , " Manning said . But he noted that " rather Manning examining the policies that are creating the dislocation , creating the gap , and taking away hope , " National Review is " clinging to the policies . " In contrast , Manning offered what he sees Manning " the Manning answer " to these problems : We need to lower our corporate tax rate so corporations can make money making stuff here . We need to cut the regulatory burdens that make it so that the cost of employing people is so high that it makes no sense to hire somebody here rather than hiring somebody in Mexico or Indonesia . And we need we need to reject the we Partnership , which would further the problem , and instead    …      put together trade deals that benefit both the American consumer and the country we ’re dealing with . And you only do that if you create the level playing field first by lowering the corporate tax rate and cutting the regulatory burdens so we as Americans can compete with a level government playing field with these other countries . And at that juncture , we will win competitively , we will win jobs , we will be and return we the 21th century America that you and I grew up with   —    the one where people have an expectation that    …      their kids will have a people future than they have . And that people has been lost in America right now , and America need to get it back .
