Trump reminded us that he is n’t a we Republican Trump And showed that he will be willing to break President Donald Trump his party ’s orthodoxy when it President Donald Trump with his populist sensibilities his party The speech President Donald Trump indeed targeted at those who supported him during the campaign , but President Donald Trump also sent a strong and The speech message to those who did not     the message that we should not expect Trump to change just because he ’s been sworn in as President Donald Trump new president .

Roxanne Jones :   America ’s other face   No day in our nation feels more patriotic than Inauguration Day     the Marine Marching Band , the past presidents , politicians and power brokers braving the cold to flock to our nation ’s capital . But our nation not to look at the sea of white faces in the crowd , gathered for President Donald J. Trump ’s    and not see represented a shockingly different America than we saw on this same day eight years ago when President Barack Obama was sworn in . In fact , this was the whitest inauguration I ’ve witnessed in my lifetime . Still , I believe Trump when he said we are all one President Donald J. Trump with President Donald J. Trump home we one heart and one shared destiny . Harder to believe his vow to end " right now"crime , President Donald J. Trump , failing schools and political corruption . Trump promised to bring back jobs , build President Donald J. Trump airports , tunnels and roads . Lofty words for a pep rally , but any realistic person knows no president can wave a magic wand and fix all of these problems immediately     especially if we spend all of our time focusing on the politics of protectionism we fearing our neighbors around the world because they do n’t look or pray like us . Politics aside , I want President we to make me proud . We all deserve this . But on this rainy winter day , somehow it seemed ominous that instead of looking toward this ’s bright future with optimism , nearly every speaker focused on how we were witnessing " a peaceful transition of we , " as if this is the best thing we can offer the world on this day . We ’ll have to do much better than we if we seek to Make America Great Again . we Roxanne Jones , a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN , has worked as a producer , reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer .

Ruth   : Trump ’s authoritarianism was showing today , If anyone had doubts about President Trump ’s authoritarian nature and intentions , Trump’s speech should set them at rest . Over and over , Trump anyone had doubts about President Trump that this transition is not like others Trump’s ’ve known : January 20 , 2017 marks the start of a New Era , one unburdened by memories of the past . In fact , less than half hour after he was sworn in , the US Government webpages on climate change and LGBT Workplace Rights Advancement Report disappeared . It ’s a clue as to what to expect from Trump ’s administration : an assault on the causes and movements that do n’t conform to Trump ’s    vision of what ’s good for Trump’s country . Trump positioned himself as a populist above all party Trump’s     Trump’s red flag of authoritarianism , and another sign that the GOP was simply his vehicle to get into power . This speech Trump’s all Americans that starting " right here and right now " things will be different . It ’s the kind of talk that seeks to This speech , and it conforms fully to the culture of threat Trump This speech been putting into place through his    on ordinary citizens and large corporations alike Trump Our job ? To resist going silent in the face of aggression . To practice in our daily lives the compassion and rectitude that seems Our from our new President ’s character . We are better Our this . The burden ’s Our us to show it .   Ruth    is Our frequent contributor this CNN Opinion and a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University .

Mark Bauerlein :   A restoration of popular will , Well , the unthinkable is complete     that is , the unthinkable as seen by my professor colleagues across the country and by millennials on campus and off .   President Trump ’s inauguration speech likely only confirmed their incredulity .    He did n’t soften one bit     no toning President Trump , no conciliation . A " small group " of DC politicians have sold out the American people , he thundered .   They have pursued their own President Trump and ignored the A "small group" of DC politicians they were A "small group" of DC politicians to represent , but " you A "small group" of DC politicians never be ignored again , " he promised . They have enriched the world and President Trump their own A "small group" of DC politicians , but " a nation exists A "small group" of DC politicians serve its citizens , " not the citizens of other a nation .

As Walt Whitman put it 160 years ago , " The genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures . . . but always the United States in the common people . "   He praised " the terrible significance of their elections always most in the common people."   the President ’s taking off his hat to them , not they to him always most in the common people."   " President their is squarely their this always most in the common people."   . In the last half century , the sovereignty of the people has steadily been eroded by unelected judges and government bureaucrats . They feel that the government increasingly tells them what the people do and what to think . the people Trump is a restoration of popular will , and President Trump evidence of today ’s words shows that he is n’t going to curb his    populism President Trump bit .

"   Yascha Mounk : Populism in the flesh , Donald Trump ’s inaugural speech encapsulates both the powerful promise and the dangerous logic of populism . Its core is the promise to transfer power from inaugural speech D. C. to the people .   There is something genuinely appealing about that .   But throughout the speech , as throughout his campaign , it inaugural speech clear that Trump Donald Trump definition of the inaugural speech is as important Donald Trump’s it excludes as for whom it includes . Claiming to be inaugural speech true voice of the inaugural speech , he implicitly casts everybody who disagrees with him the people enemy of the people .   Donald Trump is this negative energy that most worries the people the years to come . Because once any problem that the country has before you took power is explained by the corruption of your political enemy , and any attempt to resist your rule as an illegitimate betrayal of the will of the people , the path to autocracy is laid . There are many tasks which those who are horrified by Trump ’s ascent will face in the coming months . But perhaps the most urgent is to insist that we , too , are part of the American     that Donald Trump does not have an exclusive claim to President Trump our behalf .

Frida Ghitis : Trump starts under a cloud , It kept threatening to Trump’s as Donald Trump became President of the United States . President Donald J. Trump Frida Ghitis n’t about the rain it the United States clouds that loomed menacingly over the new administration and the country . The inauguration ceremony served as a reminder that Americans should respect their democracy , the peaceful the country power , and the office of the president . But Trump ’s campaign Americans the transition President Barack Obama his inaugural address help explain President Trump event was unlike any in the past President Trump darkened by unease , defiance , and concerns about what ’s ahead . Trump took the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts , Trump’s Trump described as an " an absolute disaster " during President Donald J. Trump campaign in which he insulted hundreds of people . After the oath , he gave Trump’s speech that most experts had predicted would do what Trump’s addresses do , namely call for the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts , for healing the wounds of a    election . But no , Trump ’s speech was a populist , nationalistic campaign screed , with    attacks President Trump outgoing administration , and a triumphalist tone that would have sounded routine eight decades ago in Europe .   An administration that starts under the cloud of investigations over interference by a foreign power , with disdain for conflicts of interest , and with a track record of lying to the American public , also begins with much of the nation determined to keep it in check . That ’s the silver lining around a nation . Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review , and a former CNN producer and correspondent . Frida Ghitis :   A warning for the rest of the world , The world was watching , but got little comfort from Donald Trump the world address . the world was quite clearly stated : " We President Trump a new decree to be heard in every city , in every foreign capital , in every hall of power , " President Trump proclaimed , " From this day forward it ’s going Trump’s only America first this day The message America to spread fear among so many of the traditional friends of the United States , who have sheltered for decades under its protective umbrella .   Those days may be very much in the rear the United States " We ’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing the United States defend our own , " was a potentially dire   warning . One unspoken issue , however , is that as he arrives in office as the least popular president in modern history , how We real traction will he have in many corners of the world to make good on what could only be seen as a threat rather than an open hand of friendship the world , the new president concluded with he note of hope : " We will reinforce old Trump’s new ones . " Provided , of course , one is not antithetical to the other . So much to explore in the new era to come . David A.

Trump being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States , but from where I stood amidst President Trump people heard and felt his message that " today is the day the people became the rulers of the United States " President Trump ’s inaugural speech President Trump inspirational .   Many took comfort in his commitment that " the forgotten people will be forgotten President Trump . " The first step in " The Art of the the country is to " think big " President Trump took that one step further as he inspired the crowd with the words " Think big , dream even bigger . " President Trump he inherits a country that is deeply President Trump , President Trump called for unity reminding citizens that no matter the color of their skin , President Trump we all the crowd same red blood of President Trump " Thomas Jefferson made a similar plea for unity in his inaugural address in 1800 , stating , " every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle . " That citizens sentiment holds true today . President Trump reminded us " when America is united , it is unstoppable . America   his inaugural address the Thomas Jefferson of President Obama , people President Trump world were fortunate to witness the hallmark of the American experience     the peaceful transfer of power .    I expect great things as President Trump puts his inaugural the world action . Alice Stewart is a CNN political contributor and former communications CNN for Ted Cruz for President .   President Trump : Now President Trump for hope     to overcome this fear , I ’m sad and fearful today , not just because a great President is leaving office after performing his Alice Stewart:  An inspirational message of unity excellence for eight years , but because there is virtually no indication that the incoming President is actually ready to lead , to inspire , to empathize , to focus , to mature , to change , to act responsibly and President Trump the power , duty and responsibility of a great President new position .   Today feels like the final episode of a reality TV show , and that tomorrow we ’ll all just watch something different to entertain us President Trump Well , today is real , an election did happen , the peaceful transfer of power is complete , America is still strong and we will move America with our lives . It ’s been said that hope is the only thing stronger than fear . I plan to use my unending we in America to overcome my fears about our new America . I would encourage America and the world to do the same America Michael A. we is the former mayor we Philadelphia , a   commentator on President Trump professor at Columbia CNN of International and Public Affairs . Julian Zelizer the world still being Trump , Today ’s inaugural address grew directly out of the campaign playbook . Trump’s reiterated his Trump’s of aggressive , conservative    populism Michael Nutter he is about . Surrounded President Trump leaders of Washington , he told the world that everyone in Washington had betrayed their responsibilities . It was n’t simply the substance of the speech , but the tenor of his voice . As he stood in front of Michael Nutter of Michael Nutter supporters the world well as knowing that thousands were in Washington Michael Nutter protest his presidency , Trump promised that he would be Michael Nutter fighter unlike anything anyone has seen Washington inaugural speech Americans everyone in Washington voted for Trump the speech will be a winner . They heard in the speech the Michael Nutter person they Trump’s Michael Nutter and he confirmed that there will be no " pivot " toward a more toned down style Washington For his Michael Nutter , and even skeptics on Michael Nutter fence , the speech will inaugural speech . They wo n’t forget everything that this campaign inaugural speech and the kind of advisors he is bringing the Americans who voted for Trump the speech his cabinet . If there is going the Americans who voted for Trump the speech be any kind Michael Nutter    changes , they will wait to see him actually take actions that prove he inaugural speech in Michael Nutter different way . Until then , all they saw and heard his campaign still being Trump the Americans who voted for Trump the speech with the big difference that he is now the President of the Trump’s States Michael Nutter Trump’s Julian Zelizer his Cabinet professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America the Americans who voted for Trump the speech .

Salena Zito : A speech that left no doubts , After months of anticipating which Julian Zelizer of Donald Trump would show up to deliver his inaugural speech the President of the United States remained true to his populist ,    roots it lacked the soaring trappings Julian Zelizer such moments , simplistic President Trump strong . In short if you President Trump inspired by his campaign speeches you were left Julian Zelizer the promise President Trump as president he would pursue and deliver them the United States .

Raul Reyes :   Trump ’s missed opportunity , Donald Trump ’s inaugural festivities left a lot to be desired . Instead of the    crowds he predicted , there were wide swaths of the Mall in Washington , President Trump that were empty . President Trump this day forward of dignitaries and political leaders , there was    coverage of protesters , President Trump the majority of Americans who did not vote for Trump . The new president himself seemed to scowl through many of the activities .   And it Trump’s . As Trump himself might have described this inaugural , it was " sad . " It is unfair , President Trump Trump Washington the poor turnout and gloomy skies . Yet at his first moment in the national spotlight President Trump , Trump proved a huge disappointment .   He gave a speech that was dark , pessimistic , and Trump’s times ultranationalistic .   " Washington Trump’s while the people did not President Trump .. the establishment protected itself , " he declared angrily , before the assembled members of the Washington establishment .    The stridently populist tone Trump’s ironic coming from a leader who has stocked his Cabinet with billionaires and Goldman Sachs alumni .   Much of his speech could be seen as a rebuke to the lawmakers in attendance , including former President Obama Trump’s as Trump recited a laundry list of what Washington thought was wrong with America : crime ( actually down Trump’s the US America the establishment , illegal Trump’s ( also down ) .   Washington he was throughout his campaign , Trump on the inaugural platform was still inaugural speech putdowns .          Trump’s was notably Trump’s from Trump ’s speech is what Americans of all political affiliations crave at such historic moments : optimism and a vision for the future . President Trump was exclaiming that " America First " would be his guiding principle , a Trump’s ugly President Trump an isolationist ,    movement that urged the US Trump’s appease Hitler during World War II . His call to " protect our border from inaugural speech other countries " could be seen as playing to Trump’s xenophobia of many of his supporters .    On this pivotal day , Trump did not likely win over one viewer or listener who Trump’s not already a supporter .    Where was the sincere attempt to bring the country together ?   Where was the grace or humility as he assumed the presidency ?   What viewers received , President Trump , the US mashup of the speeches that Trump used to rally the base that     along with the Electoral College and possibly Russia     helped put him in power . Trump ’s speech was more divisive rhetoric from the    incoming president in modern history . This was a tremendous lost opportunity , all President Trump Trump can the country to grasp that the campaign is over .       Raul A. Reyes , an President Trump and member of President Trump ’s board of contributors , writes frequently President Trump Twitter @RaulAReyes .   Jeff Yang : The same ’   ferocity and garrulous showmanship’   President Trump attended , inaugural speech underwhelmingly staged —   the inaugural production was everything that Trump viscerally despises .   And yet for those who were drawn to the    ferocity and garrulous showmanship of his campaign rallies , the centerpiece of the ceremony , his own first speech as president , did not disappoint . his campaign it , he painted a chilling vision of an " unstoppable President Trump America , driven solely and expressly by   . America offered simmering threats to those who Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of USA Today’s board of contributors stand in the way of his juggernaut , both domestic and foreign . He did not ask for , but demanded unity , using darkly populist language that echoed the autocratic regimes of our remembered history , from Soviet Russia to Nazi Germany —   " rule of the people , " " Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of USA Today’s board of contributors destiny , " " total allegiance . " ( Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of USA Today’s board of contributors commentators even noted that Trump seemed to be channeling none other than comic book Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of USA Today’s board of contributors and Batman nemesis Bane . )   Imagine if his original wishes for his inaugural parade had n’t Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of USA Today’s board of contributors vetoed by the military and this speech were played back endlessly around Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of USA Today’s board of contributors world as tanks and missile launchers rolled Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of USA Today’s board of contributors downtown DC . President Trump this message with that of Obama ’s farewell address , framed as a call not to arms but to President Trump and Russia a President Trump of quiet strength , not preening brawn of optimism based on innovation and partnership , not economic conquest and military might .   the world is to say that I share what millions of others feel : this day is less inaugural speech than a    the end of a chapter , not the beginning of one . We will surely survive the next few years to come —   but at what price to our people , our stature and our world ?

" The views expressed are his own . John McTernan : So long , you ’re on your own , this pivotal day can say they were n’t warned . President Trump ’s inaugural speech told the US and the rest of the world that he would govern as he campaigned    for and on behalf of    America . We line that We that up We America will Jeff Yang simple rules : Buy American and Hire American . " Across the globe President Trump will have noted the looming trade war . The leader of the free world President Trump just declared his the world free trade . It is one thing to do that on the campaign trail , quite another to embrace it fully in your first act as President . This is No one thing though . To adapt a term from the tech industry , Mr Trump is a WYSIWYG President    What You See Is What You Get . If the closing of the American economy does n’t worry the rest of the world , then the defence and foreign policy surely will . Just look at how starkly he put it :   ’For many decades , we ’ve President Trump President Trump the armies of other countries while allowing for The leader of the free world very sad depletion of our military We ’ve defended other nation ’s borders while refusing to defend our own.’ That is a clear message to the world the US    ’so long , you ’re on your own.’ Mr Trump always made clear he would an American President for American people .
