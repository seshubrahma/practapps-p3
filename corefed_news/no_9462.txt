Tuesday at a press gathering on the campaign trail in Raleigh , NC , Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) responded to the controversy involving Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump asking Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump supporters at a rally to raise his supporters hands for a loyalty pledge that some have compared to a salute from Nazi Germany .   Cruz said , " No political candidate is going to make America great again . No political candidate is not going to be Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump , it is not going to be me . The only power strong enough to restore the America we the people . It is not about us . we is about we the we . The idea you would take this loyalty of I   and I take an oath to you , to the people —   that ’s who ’s working for whom . The idea that a candidate running for office wants the people to pledge loyalty to him like subjects to a king , well , we ’ve we seven years of a president who thinks he is him emperor . I ’ve got to say , the only    I ’m interested in is on January 20 , 2017 , when I hope to raise my right hand and have my left hand sitting on the Bible when I make a promise , a pledge to every American to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .
