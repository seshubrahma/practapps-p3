On Thursday ’s broadcast of CNN ’s " Situation Room , " Senator Dianne Feinstein ( ) stated that she has not seen any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians , and that special counsel Robert Mueller ’s investigation is the one that " would bring forward solid evidence on which you could base a criminal case and indict someone . "   Anchor Wolf Blitzer asked , " The last time we spoke , Senator , I asked you if you had actually seen evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians , and you the Russians me   —    and I ’m quoting you know   —    you said , ‘ Not at this time.’ Has anything changed since we spoke last ? " Feinstein we , " Well , not   —    no , it has n’t . So , this time.’ would depend on this investigation that we ’re talking about , that would bring forward any criminal activity , and , of course , has the right and the ability to charge people , select targets , look at them , bring about an indictment people And so , it ’s a very big investigation this time.’ and I think somebody that ’s as sophisticated as Bob Mueller is really the one to carry it out and see that it does not go awry , it does not overeach , but it ’s what it should be it " Blitzer it up , " [ S]o far , you have not seen any evidence of collusion , is that right ? " Feinstein responded , " Well , evidence that would establish that there ’s collusion . There are all kinds of rumors around . there are newspaper stories , but that ’s not necessarily evidence . And so , you ’ve got the Intelligence Committee looking at it , and you will have the Intelligence Committee Mueller investigation going on , and it ’s the Mueller investigation that the Intelligence Committee bring forward Mueller evidence on which you could base a criminal case and indict someone .
