Sarah Palin ( ) the 2008 GOP   nominee said , " Well darn right voters are mad . It ’s righteous indignation . But what the professional political class really ca n’t handle is knowing that the movement is more than anger . the movement ’s an optimistic , sensible building up the people agenda and that is good change , but to the professional political class the movement ’s a threat . You know those threatened GOP’ers who insist that the professional political class will never vote for the professional political class party ’s choice this time ? the professional political class call the professional political class   —    that game   —    never hashtag   —   well I just call the professional political class Republicans Against Trump , or RAT for short . the professional political class want to take the professional political class Nuggets ball home and stay home instead of vote because the professional political class guy did n’t win this time around . Now I should n’t call the professional political class thumb suckers because the professional political class are not all bad . I ’m kidding , the professional political class are . And Hillary thanks the professional political class because Hillary can not win without the professional political class . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
