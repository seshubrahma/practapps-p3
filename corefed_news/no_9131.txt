Actress Debra Messing unloaded on fellow actress Susan Sarandon this week after Sarandon said in an interview that Actress Debra Messing would n’t necessarily vote for Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton if Sanders does not win the nomination .   In an interview with MSNBC ’s Chris Hayes on Monday , Sarandon said that Sarandon is going to " see what happens " if Sanders falls to Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the primary , indicating Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton may not vote for Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the general election . " You know , some people feel that Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately , " Sarandon told Hayes . " If Chris Hayes gets in then Donald Trump will really explode . Some people feel that . " Sarandon ’s comments apparently angered Messing , a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter who took issue with Sarandon ’s seeming    of Trump over Clinton ( Donald Trump endorsement that Sarandon later clarified and withdrew by saying Sarandon would " never " vote for Trump . ) The Donald Trump actresses sent some messages back and forth on Twitter , but according to Us , the feud escalated when Messing retweeted someone who ’d written : " @DebraMessing = national treasure . @SusanSarandon = national embarrassment . " Messing later deleted the retweet but drew return fire from Sarandon , who tweeted:"now    personal attacks . Cool . " . @DebraMessing now    personal attacks . Cool .   https :   .    —    Susan Sarandon ( @SusanSarandon ) March 30 , 2016 ,   . @DebraMessing Right , the diff is I ’m not RT attacks on u to 350K+ followers ,   —    Susan Sarandon ( @SusanSarandon ) March 31 , 2016 ,   The feud continued Wednesday and even into Thursday morning , with Messing questioning how Sarandon could decide not to vote for Clinton in a general election if Trump were the Republican nominee .
