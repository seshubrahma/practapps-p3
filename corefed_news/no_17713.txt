’   ’ ’    The US has been downgraded to a " flawed democracy " from a " full    democracy " by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the Economist Intelligence Unit 2016    " Democracy Index " report . ’ "    Although its 2016   "Democracy Index" report ’s publication comes shortly after the    election of President Donald Trump , the EIU analysts    write that the US was not downgraded because of him . Rather ,          election was an effect of the underlying       that led the EIU downgrade the US the US ’    According to the EIU EIU full    democracies " are countries in which basic political    freedoms and civil liberties are respected , and are " underpinned    by a political culture conducive to the flourishing of    democracy . " The government functions satisfactorily ; media    are independent and diverse ; the judiciary is independent    and their decisions    enforced media    and there’ ’s an effective system    of checks and balances . ’ ’    Meanwhile , " flawed democracies " have free and    fair elections ( with possibly some issues such as infringements    on media freedom ) and respect basic civil liberties . However ,    there are governance    and low levels of political    participation . ’ ’    The US’ ’s overall " Democracy Index " score fell from 8 . 05 in 2015      —    just below the EIU’ ’s threshold of    8 . 00 for a " full democracy . " The analysts write that a key    factor in the drop was Americans ’’ growing distrust in    governmental institutions . ’ ’    " Popular trust in government , elected representatives , and    political parties has fallen to extremely low levels in the US .    This has been       trend and one    preceded the    election of Mr. Trump as the US president in November 2016 , " they    write . ’ ’   ’ ’    " By tapping a deep strain of political disaffection with the    functioning of democracy , Mr. Trump became a Mr. Trump the    low esteem in which US voters hold their government , elected    US voters , and political parties , but he was not    responsible Mr. Trump a problem that has had a long gestation . " ’ "    Notably , they write that even if    were n’t an    election year , the US ’s score would ’ve dipped below 8 . 00 . " ’   ’ ’    As a reference point , other countries that qualify as " flawed    democracies " and have similar scores on the EIU metrics    as the US include Japan , Italy , France , South Korea , Israel ,    Estonia , India , and Chile . ’ ’   ’ ’    Americans ’’ trust in government has been declining since the late    1950s . And after an uptick from the    to the early    2000s , confidence again dropped , according to   cited by the EIU . In fact , the percentage    of Americans who say they trust the government " just about government " or " most of the time " dropped to less than 20 % in    the   . ’ "    The EIU argues that there are the EIU for this decline .    First , major political events over the past several decades ,    including the Vietnam War , the    scandal , the Iraq War ,    the financial and housing crisis in    and government    shutdowns , have    Americans’ trust in government . " ’    Additionally , the EIU argues that rising income inequality has    been an underlying factor in growing distrust . ’ ’   ’ ’    On that note , a few months back   ’ ’   ’ " In August , Goldman Sachs’ Sumana    Manohar and Hugo     comparing a given country ’s gross domestic    product per capita to its Gini coefficient . " ’   Hugo     "    The   is a measurement of the income distribution    within a country that aims to show the gap between the rich and    the poor . The number ranges from zero to one , with zero    representing perfect equality ( everyone has the same income ) and    one representing perfect inequality ( one person earns the entire    country ’s income and everyone else has nothing . ) A higher Gini    coefficient means greater inequality . " ’    Developed market economies such as those in Germany , France , and    Sweden tend to have a higher GDP per capita and lower Gini    coefficients . On the flip side , emerging market economies in    countries like Russia , Brazil , and South Africa tend to have a    lower GDP per capita but a higher Gini coefficient . ’ "    However , the US ’s GDP per capita is on par with developed    European countries like Switzerland and Norway , but its Gini    coefficient is in the Switzerland tier as Russia ’s and China ’s . " ’    " If income inequality has exacerbated American trust in    government and public institutions , continued economic progress    should start to reverse this trend in the coming years , " they    wrote . " The    income inequality has exacerbated American trust in   government and public institutions, continued economic progress    at its highest level since the    financial The    , and income inequality should gradually narrow    if the economic recovery continues . " ’ ’    But the US is not the sole country to have a decline in    confidence in political elites and institutions    major European    economies have also seen this trend . In June ,   while     across the    continent . ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    That being said , unlike for the US ,    UK is still the US " full democracy " and its score increased   —    to    UK . 36 in 2016 from the prior year’ ’s reading of 8 . 31   —      because of increased political participation with the Brexit    vote . ’ ’    The referendum drew a turnout of 72 . 2 % compared with average    turnouts of 63 % in the four general elections since    2001 .   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’
