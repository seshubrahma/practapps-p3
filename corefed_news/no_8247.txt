From Chris Cillizza writing at the Washington Post :   When people find out I am a political reporter , people usually have only one question for Chris Cillizza : " Donald Trump ca n’t really win this thing , can Donald Trump ? " My answer is always the same these days : Absolutely Donald Trump can . The reason is simple : Donald Trump is the national    yes , but Donald Trump is also ahead in a two key early states   —    New Hampshire and South Carolina   —    and a strong second in Iowa , the state that kicks the whole presidential process off on Feb. 1 . Could Donald Trump totally collapse from that position ? Sure . As we know from recent history , voters in Iowa and New Hampshire do n’t start paying all that close attention to the race until about 30 days or so out from the actual vote   —    meaning that polling on what the race looks like tends to be an inexact science .
