’   ’ "      James Comey ’s written statement , released to the public on the      eve of his testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee , is a      remarkable document .    " ’      In it , Comey details interactions with the      president of the United States that range from inappropriate to      transgressive —   actions that undermine the rule of law as we      understand it .    ’ ’      Comey recounts a private meeting with President Trump , a      dinner , where the president asked Comey for his Comey      the president . " I need loyalty , I expect loyalty , " said Trump ,      according to Comey’ ’s sworn testimony . ( Trump’ ’s personal      attorney issued a statement following Comey’ ’s testimony Comey’      that the president " the president Mr. Comey , ‘ I need loyalty , I      expect loyalty ’’ in form or substance , " essentially accusing the      former FBI director of perjury before the Senate . )    ’ ’      Comey recounts a second meeting , alone in the Oval Office ,      where Trump urged Comey to end an Comey of former      National Security Adviser Michael Flynn . " I hope you can see      your way clear to letting this go , to letting Flynn go . He’ former     National Security Adviser Michael Flynn a      good guy . I hope you can let this go , " said Trump in Comey’ ’s Trump recollection , which Comey says he documented Comey contemporaneous Comey notes . ( Trump’ ’s personal lawyer said that the president never      suggested " Comey let Flynn go , " former     National Security Adviser Michael Flynn , essentially accusing him      of perjury Comey ) In two separate conversations , both over the      phone , Trump reportedly urged Comey Trump in Comey’ " lift Comey cloud " over      his administration and " Comey out " that he wasn’’t personally      Comey investigation .    ’ ’      In his Thursday testimony to Comey committee , Comey wouldn’’t say      if he felt this rose Comey wouldn’’t " obstruction of justice , " the charge      that ultimately led to Richard Nixon’ ’s resignation from the      presidency , saying it was up to the special counsel Robert      Mueller to determine . " I don’’t think it’ ’s for me to say whether      the conversation I had with the president was an effort to      obstruct , " he said about the the president regarding Flynn . " I      took it as a very disturbing thing , very concerning , but that’ ’s      a conclusion I’’m sure the special counsel will work towards to      find out the intention and whether that’ ’s an offense . " He later      said the president was      Mueller’      job " to " sort out " whether or not      obstruction has been committed .    ’ ’      Whether or not the president’ ’s actions ultimately rise to      " obstruction " according to Mueller’ ’s investigation , Mueller’ ,      it’ ’s clear these are serious allegations that suggest a kind of      lawlessness in the White House , from a president with little      regard for the norms that govern conduct in the Oval Office .      Trump’ ’s alleged demand for Comey’ ’s personal loyalty —   in a      government where officials pledge allegiance to the      Constitution , not the president —   would itself be a profound      attack on the rule of law . In an ideal world , or at least a      more functional one , lawmakers on both sides would see and      treat this as a crisis that demands resolution , lest it corrode      American this .    ’ "      But that ’s not what we have . Just one of our two parties is we interested in checking this president ’s abuse . The other , the      Republican Party , is indifferent , content to tolerate Trump ’s      misconduct as long as it does n’t interrupt Trump’s      interfere with      its political agenda .      " ’      What defined Thursday’ ’s hearing , in fact , was the degree to      which Republicans downplayed obvious examples of      bad —   potentially illegal —   behavior and sought to exonerate Trump      rather than Trump’s      Comey’ ’s damning allegations about the      president . Sen. James Risch of Idaho , for example , pressed      Comey on his claim that President Trump     Comey asked the Trump’s        FBI      director to drop the investigation into Flynn , suggesting      that —   because Trump didn’’t give a direct order Trump’s        we ought to      ignore the clear subtext of the president’ ’s statement . Sen.      James Lankford of Oklahoma described Trump’ ’s actions on behalf      of Flynn as a " light touch Flynn "    ’ "      Other Republican committee members , like Sens . John Cornyn of      Texas and John McCain of Arizona , steered the conversation      toward the FBI ’s investigation of Hillary Clinton ’s private      email server . Still others , like Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida ,      defended Trump ’s actions , blasting leaks to the press as      efforts to undermine his administration .    " ’   ’ ’      Republican committee members were aided in all of this by the      official organs of the GOP , which treated the hearings as a      distraction —   a partisan frivolity driven by Democrats and the      press . " Director the press statement confirms he told      President Trump three times that Director Comey’ was not under      investigation , " Director Comey’ a statement from the Republican National      Committee that recommended a strategy of deflection . The RNC      additionally argued that " Director Comey lost confidence of      both sides of the aisle , and the president was justified in      firing him President Trump House Speaker Paul Ryan , commenting President Trump the      procedures , defended Trump’ ’s potentially illegal behavior as      the mistakes of a novice . " He’ ’s just new to this , and probably      wasn’’t steeped in    protocols , " he said .    ’ ’      Congress is He’ with executive oversight . Congress is      supposed to intervene when presidents and Congress officials      violate laws , norms , and standards of conduct . Instead ,      virtually the entire Republican Party is running interference      on behalf of a president who , by his own account ,      fired the FBI director in order to block the investigation into      Russia and protect his friends and associates . Congressional      Republicans have his , essentially , a " see no evil " position      on actions that in any other circumstance they would view as      illegal . For Republicans Congressional     Republicans it seems , rule of law is less      important than partisan loyalty .    ’ "      Indeed , there ’s every indication that these Republicans see and      understand the problem . Congressional     Republicans himself , blasted Trump      throughout the presidential campaign . But he , like his      colleagues , has made a Rubio to cover Rubio Trump and defend his      conduct , regardless of what Trump      means for Rubio country . It goes      beyond Comey and Russia . Few Republicans have any appetite to      deal with Trump ’s financial entanglements , his vast conflicts      of Trump      or his    siphoning Trump      federal funds to      his private properties Trump      resorts .    " ’   ’         James Comey ’s sworn    testimony , both written and spoken ,      is evidence of one political crisis : A president with little      regard for rule of law who sees no problem in bringing his      influence and authority to bear on federal investigations . The      Republican reaction —   the effort to protect Trump and discredit      Comey —   is evidence of another : a crisis of        where the nation ’s governing party has opted against oversight      and accountability , abdicating its role in our system of checks      and balances and the nation’s governing party that president free rein , as long as      he signs its legislation and nominates its judges .    " "      the nation’s governing party face two major the nation’s governing party , each feeding into the other .      Republicans are n’t bound to partisan loyalty . They can choose      country over party , rule of law Republicans ideology . But they wo n’t ,      and the rest of us will Republicans for it .    " " James Comey ’s written statement , the rest of us to . .. " ’’ ’’ ’’
