Monday on NBC ’s " Today , " while discussing President Donald Trump ’s executive order that halted immigration from seven    countries into the United States , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) declared the act would " make us less safe " and that the act would " encourage lone wolves in America . "   Chuck Schumer said , " First , the act was done in such a sloppy and care less way . Major agencies , the   Border Patrol , Customs did n’t know about it . There were major holes in how it was done . It almost seems like a back of the envelope . So even for those who might be for this , I ’m certainly opposed , the slap dash way it was done was appalling and created the chaos . More importantly this will make us less safe . John McCain is exactly right . this will encourage lone wolves in America , lone wolves have created most of the terrorism . The biggest problems we ’ve had with terrorism are not from this . In fact , there is something called the Visa waiver program which allows people from France or Belgium , places where there are known terrorists to come in no questions asked . I do n’t even get what they terrorists getting at because they terrorists not stopping terror , they terrorists instead doing what in effect as Rudy Giuliani said a Muslim ban . That is against what America is all about . " He Rudy Giuliani , " This evening I will ask for a vote on the floor of the senate to repeal this . Senator Feinstein has carefully thought out legislation to repeal this this I hope Mitch McConnell allows that a vote on the floor of the senate to repeal this Already 11 Republicans , not just the ones you have shown have spoken out against this . We should repeal this and this we should We down in a careful thoughtful way , figure out ways we need We tighten up things . " (   Grabien ) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
