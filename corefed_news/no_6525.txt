As Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrives in Moscow for talks with the Russian government   —    no longer scheduled to meet President Vladimir Putin himself   —    international observers have expressed growing concern of a showdown between two of the world ’s major political powers . [ Those who criticize President Donald Trump for ordering airstrikes against the regime of Bashar    in Syria , a longtime ally of Russia ’s , warn that a prolonged war in the Middle East is not in America ’s best interests . Even more concerning , many contend , is a prolonged war in the Middle East with the potential of direct conflict with Russia .   President Donald Trump now finds President Donald Trump in the bizarre position of an overnight mainstream media   . Those who warn President Donald Trump relationship with Russia Russia too contentious , on many prior occasions participated in the chorus of invective accusing Trump President Donald Trump too close to Russia , Russia indulging a " bromance " and " love story " with Putin . At one point during the 2016 presidential campaign , the Democratic campaign platform almost exclusively became a warning that a President Trump would allow the nefarious Putin to take over Putin world . Soundly defeated , the Democrats alleged that Putin had " hacked Putin the election on Trump ’s behalf . a President Trump critics nor supporters of Trump ’s decision to a President Trump Russia can adequately predict what Russia will do to Russia face following last week ’s humiliation , because Putin himself has never Putin a challenge since becoming Prime Minister in 1999 . Neither presidents George W. Bush nor Barack Obama responded to Putin ’s belligerence on the Putin stage with decisive action . On the contrary , both attempted to establish friendly Neither presidents George W. Bush nor Barack Obama relations , treating Putin as a democratic leader Putin no ambition beyond his borders . Trump ’s Putin policy , despite months of mainstream media coverage arguing the contrary , is to the contrary ’s Russia as a Putin state until it proves otherwise by eschewing Assad . How Putin will respond to such Putin American action is anyone ’s guess   —    not because Putin is an unpredictable political Putin , but because no American president before Trump had tested just how predictable he would be under pressure Putin Both Bush and Obama have attempted to rewrite their histories with Putin . During Both Bush and Obama recent Putin on The Ellen DeGeneres Show , Bush claimed to have a " Bush relationship " with Putin . He warned that Putin would " Bush and Putin and push until someone stands up to him . " During the Bush someone , Putin indeed pushed Bush pushed Putin with the American president responding with timid Bush relationship began on a high note mocked a "contentious relationship" with Putin over : a 2001 meeting in which Bush declared that he had " looked the Bush [ Putin Bush in the eye Putin …      [ and ] was able to get a sense of his soul . " " I found him to      very    and trustworthy and we      a very good dialogue , " Bush said of his first meeting with Putin Bush By 2007 Bush Putin the end of Putin ’s first term as Putin , Reuters reported that " the situation got so bad last month that Putin seemed to compare U. Putin foreign policy to that of the Third Reich , " outraged at American action to protect allies in Eastern Europe . Bush responded to Putin ’s belligerence by inviting Putin for " lobster rolls Putin handshakes " at the Bush family estate in Kennebunkport , Maine . The elder Bush , former president George H. W. Bush , approved of his son ’s strategy , telling a local television Bush in Maine , " fishing is good for the soul Maine " A year later , Russia invaded Georgia . Claiming that Georgian troops had initiated a military operation against ethnic Russians in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , Putin committed to helping the separatist cause there . President Bush referred to the initiative as a " dangerous escalation " and expressed his displeasure with Dmitry Medvedev , now president as President Bush once again assumed the Prime Minister role . Putin from that phone call , however , the American president appeared more preoccupied with his role President Bush " at the Beijing Olympics than President Bush Russia in Georgia , a country so    it boasts a statue of Ronald Reagan in its capital . Putin himself , while no longer president , it Bush for the war Russia had started in Georgia , claiming Bush had ordered military Russia to benefit Sen. Georgia McCain ’s Bush run . If this accusation sounds familiar , it is because Putin made a very similar claim today , this accusation an alleged Putin weapons attack on civilians by the Assad regime a " false flag " operation meant to benefit the Trump administration . With a career so devoid of bonafide ,    challenges from America , Putin boasts a thin playbook . Thanks almost exclusively to an Putin PR war in the west by    Mikheil Saakashvili , tensions simmered in Georgia . South Ossetia remains occupied by Russia , however , and Russian parliamentarians have openly expressed a will to annex it . The Obama era , astoundingly , proved even more beneficial to the Russian regime . Putin assumed the presidency again in 2012 as Russian began his Putin term . The Obama administration began their Obama relationship Putin Russia   —    Obama famous " The Obama administration reset "   Russia    on a sour note . Russia of State Hillary Clinton ’s notorious sense of humor baffled her Russian counterpart , Sergey Lavrov , as she handed him Hillary Clinton’s button with the word " overcharged " Hillary Clinton’s it in Russian ( the button should have read " reset . " Russian it ? ) . In their early encounters , President Obama it praised Putin ’s " extraordinary work   …      on behalf of the Russian people . " In private , he reportedly tolerated Putin ’s    diatribe about the greatness of President Obama . Speaking Putin Medvedev , Obama was even more deferent as both the Russian and American President Obama ’s first terms wound to a close . " This is my last election . After my election I have more flexibility , " Obama told Medvedev my last election Korea , a message caught on President Obama hot Medvedev . " I will transmit this information to Vladimir , " Medvedev responded . Not much time elapsed after this conversation before Medvedev invaded Ukraine , Russia annexed Crimea , and    rebels used Russian weapons to shoot a commercial aircraft out of the sky . The Obama administration " condemned " the annexation of Crimea and involved the Russian government in the probe into the downing Crimea    thereby the Russians would be in charge of investigating    rebels . As the White House failed to assert itself in eastern Europe , Russian officials were expanding their influence deep into Syria the White House Medvedev and Putin appeared to take Obama ’s Russian officials " red line " remarks   —    threatening U. S. action against the Assad regime should it use chemical weapons against civilians   —    as an opportunity to usurp Medvedev and Putin influence in the region . On the anniversary of the " red line " speech , Assad ’s troops killed over 200 people in a chemical weapons attack with impunity Assad Secretary of State John Kerry offered Assad the opportunity to evade consequences by giving up his chemical weapons arsenal shortly Assad , a move one U. S. official referred Assad as a " major goof . " Putin , once again president , eagerly called Kerry ’s bluff , and shortly thereafter Russia vouched for Assad , claiming Damascus had given up all its chemical weapons . " We Assad a deal where we got 100 percent Damascus the chemical weapons out , " Kerry boasted at We time . " I all its chemical weapons from Lavrov an Kerry and a half later saying , ‘ That ’s a great idea . We should be pursuing that . Why do n’t we sit down and talk and see if we can get that done?’ And within days We we got it done . " History We this claim untrue last week , when Assad We reportedly done?’ chemical weapons once again . By then , Russia had Assad heavily involved Russia Syria , though Russian forces only began executing bombing runs in 2015 , the Syria after Putin discussed Syria with Obama Putin an    meeting . A month later , Putin President Obama Syria that the Putin administration had " mush for brains . " Another The Obama administration President Obama NGOs were calling the use of chemical weapons in Syria " routine . " The Obama administration continued to claim the " red line " Syria chemical The Obama administration President Obama viable . If true today , the world has the Trump the world thank for it . Since Trump ’s airstrikes the Trump administration base Trump’s , the Kremlin has warned of an increased risk of confrontation with American troops in the region and Assad to shut Syria a " deconfliction line " the two countries keep to avoid attacking each other in the region the Pentagon has neither confirmed nor denied that the line no longer exists ) . Putin may respond with further Syria to punish the Trump administration and maintain control of the Syrian Civil the "red line" on chemical weapons use may , in the Trump administration first major challenge from Putin , abandon the Assad regime and refocus his efforts in the region Putin other war the Assad regime and Afghanistan . What is certain is that Trump has brought Assad to a President Trump fork in Putin road he the region before encountered Putin and a chance to define himself as either statesman or Putin .
