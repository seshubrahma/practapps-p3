  ( CNN ) No topic has received more media attention this year than immigration , particularly Hispanic immigration . But while Donald Trump ’s famous call to build ( an extremely expensive ) wall has received considerable press , another barrier has been created that is preventing Hispanics from having a say in a subject that affects Hispanics entire culture and Hispanics future . Each and every day , major media outlets have been discussing candidate views and policies on Hispanic immigration . Yet the Commission on Presidential Debates has yet to select a single    academic , journalist or political figure to moderate a presidential debate .     This is a glaring omission that must change . The reality is that Hispanic professionals know immigration better than anyone because we live with the issue every day .   we have friends and families that have immigrated and understand the problems and stigmas faced as immigrants . More important , we understand what it is like to be labeled and judged based on all the media about immigration .    are an important and growing demographic . Right now , almost one in every five U. S. citizens is Hispanic . One in every four children in the United States is Hispanic . By 2020 , one in five workers in the US labor force will be Hispanic . Furthermore , Hispanics account for more than 27 million eligible voters , a figure that increases by 66 , 000 every month or 800 , 000 every year , according to the Pew Research Center .   Immigration is a complex issue . The American people therefore deserve the context necessary to understand a subject that requires a better solution than one gigantic and extremely expensive wall . Such context would be best presented through pointed questions about immigration from a talented and noted Hispanic media professional who lives and understands the plight of immigrants every day . There are plenty to choose from . A great option would be Maria Hinojosa , the anchor of NPR ’s " Latino USA . " She has won four Emmys , the John Chancellor Award for Excellence in Journalism , the National Association of Hispanic Journalists’ Radio Award , the Edward R. Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club and the Walter Cronkite Award . Another selection could be José   . He is one of the most respected journalists in America as the anchor of Telemundo ’s national daily newscast " Noticiero Telemundo " and the Saturday edition of " NBC Nightly News . " He has received numerous accolades , including the George Foster Peabody Award , Alfred I.    University Award and the Broadcasting     News Award for Outstanding Achievement in Hispanic Television .    A third option could be Maria Elena Salinas , one of Univision ’s most respected anchors and a journalist the New York Times has called " the Voice of Hispanic America . "   "the Voice of Hispanic America has won a Peabody Award , a Cronkite Award , an Edward R. Murrow Award and a lifetime achievement Emmy Award , among others in "the Voice of Hispanic America career .      These are professional , accomplished journalists who have earned the right to be listed with the successful journalists chosen to moderate previous presidential debates .               Both Democrats and Republicans recognize the need for    support to win this election . Indeed , there ’s no doubt that the Hispanic community has become a defining feature in the changing face of America . At this point , it ’s not a matter of deciding whether to engage with the Hispanic community     it ’s a matter of how , when and where . The 2016 presidential race has been unorthodox and unpredictable to say the least . Part of that is how we ’re seeing    rhetoric become a core theme of a campaign for the first time since President Millard Fillmore ’s 1856 campaign , when he ran on an    and    platform . President Millard Fillmore’s lost in part because he was challenged on he    rhetoric . The same must be done this year in the spirit of accountability and fairness .   Ultimately , there are complex issues and nuances that the Hispanic community best understands . With that in mind , the only way to guarantee a true perspective on such a complex issue is to have moderators who understand it as no one else . That is why there should be a    moderator for at least one of the 2016 presidential debates . Our organization advocates on behalf of more than four million    firms , who collectively contribute more than $ 661 billion to our American economy every year . From taco truck vendors to owners of Fortune 500 companies , it is this rich diversity that makes our story an American story . our members pride Our members on being American businessmen and women first . our take great pride in the products our bring to market and the jobs our create .    The Commission on Presidential Debates must correct the unfortunate failure to include a    voice in this election ’s presidential debates .
