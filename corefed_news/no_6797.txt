Thursday in Davos , Switzerland , at the the World Economic Forum speaking with Bloomberg ’s Francine Lacqua , Soros Fund Management Chairman George Soros said    Donald Trump is " an imposter and con man and    dictator . "   Soros Fund Management Chairman George Soros said , " I ’ve described Donald Trump as an imposter and con man and    dictator , but Donald Trump is only a    dictator . The Constitution and institutions of the United States are strong enough , the division of power is in operation . Donald Trump would be a dictator if Donald Trump could get away with it . But Donald Trump wo n’t be able to . " Discussing the markets , Donald Trump added , " It is impossible to predict exactly how Trump is going to act because Donald Trump has n’t actually thought Trump through . Trump did n’t expect to win . Trump was surprised . Trump was engaged in building Trump brand and improving his brand by Trump success in attracting crowds . It is really only when Trump got elected that Trump started seriously to think about what Trump is going to do . I personally am convinced that Trump is going to fail , not because of people like me who would like Trump to fail , but because the ideas that guide Trump are inherently   . And the contradictions are actually already embodied by Trump advisors . "   " Trump has got three chiefs of staff instead of one , and in Trump cabinet , " Trump continued . " Therefore we will have the various establishments fighting with each other and that is going to cause very unpredictable outcomes . Right now uncertainty is at uncertainty peak . And actually , uncertainty is the enemy of    investment . I do n’t think the markets are going to do very well . Right now the markets are still celebrating . But when reality comes , it will prevail . " (   Grabien ) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
