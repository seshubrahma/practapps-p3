Mark Krikorian , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies , discussed    Donald Trump ’s choice of Andrew Puzder for secretary of labor and other Donald Trump cabinet nominees on Monday ’s Breitbart News Daily . [ Mark Krikorian said Donald Trump focus was on    angles for Donald Trump cabinet choices , so he Donald Trump little feedback on such nominees as Betsy DeVos for education secretary , for example .    " As far as immigration goes , clearly his Donald Trump general pick , Senator Sessions , is outstanding . And frankly , even beyond immigration policy , I think Jeff Sessions has the potential to be one of the best attorneys general in our history . There ’s no question there at all . " " The next thing is Homeland Security , and Trump picked retired Marine General John Kelly , who ’s been very strong on border security , " he Trump . " He Trump head of what ’s called Southern Command . He Trump head of all military actions , U. S. military activity , in Latin America and the Caribbean . And so he Trump directly in contact with the issues of border security on our southern border . He Trump been very good on that . The open question there is , what about the rest of immigration law ? Because there ’s a lot to immigration other than security of the our southern border I have no reason to think he Trump be bad on any of that , but it ’s an open question , so hopefully , we ’re going to learn more as time goes on . I"m optimistic let me put it that way . " SiriusXM host Alex Marlow brought up Labor nominee Puzder ’s comments that he preferred foreign SiriusXM host Alex Marlow to American workers as a corporate CEO , a position from which he is now SiriusXM host Alex Marlow away . " It was a huge red flag initially , " said Krikorian . " I ’m not sure who did the vetting here . Now Puzder , he Labor nominee Puzder a SiriusXM host Alex Marlow executive , and so you could see that he would n’t SiriusXM host Alex Marlow been an immigration hawk or hardliner , just as far as his business goes SiriusXM host Alex Marlow "   " But he was n’t SiriusXM host Alex Marlow a regular business executive who kind of liked having foreign workers as cheap labor he was out SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on this issue , " Krikorian recalled . Krikorian During the whole    Gang of Eight thing , back in 2013 , he was writing SiriusXM host Alex Marlow giving interviews . And even more recently , even last year , he signed on SiriusXM host Alex Marlow some statement from Republican donors calling for comprehensive immigration reform . So this is something . "   " He ’s not SiriusXM host Alex Marlow agreed with this Obama agenda on immigration . He ’s been SiriusXM host Alex Marlow of the champions , one of the most important business champions on this , " he contended . SiriusXM host Alex Marlow So while I ’m glad to see that once Breitbart did this story , and the public really started to get anxious about this , he released a Breitbart about how his job is Breitbart American workers and the rest of it . I ’m glad to ’m that , but how sincere is this kind of thing ? I do n’t know . I ’m doubtful . ’m   " National Review did an editorial from the magazine itself saying it wants senators National Review the confirmation hearings to get Mr. Puzder down on the record about being tough on    programs . He ca n’t Mr. Puzder the law , but he can run Mr. Puzder either loosely , the way Obama ’s been running them , or them can run Mr. Puzder much tighter ship with tighter standards , and essentially you would end up with fewer guest workers and do less harm , at least , to American workers . That ’s the kind of thing that Republican senators at the hearings   —    whenever that is , it ’s going to be in January some time   —    they can really hold his feet to Mr. Puzder fire on that , and get him on the Mr. Puzder on those things . That ’s the best I think at this point we can do , as well as keeping the public attention up , the kind of thing that you guys do , " Krikorian said . Marlow mentioned the old canard about how there are " jobs Americans just wo n’t do . " Krikorian said , Krikorian You hear this from a lot of business people , and there ’s just nothing to it . " this said the Krikorian for Immigration Studies has reviewed Census Bureau data on jobs , which are grouped into roughly 400 categories , and " every one of those categories , except for a few small ones , have a majority of    workers in them . "   workers in them For instance , janitors , " he said . Krikorian People often think of janitors or maids , that kind of thing , as work Americans wo n’t do . Well , 75 percent of janitors are    Americans . It does n’t mean anything to say , ‘ That ’s a job Americans wo n’t do’ because only 75 percemt of the people who do it are    Americans . "   " There ’s a kernel of truth in the sense that American ’s wo n’t do some of this work if the wages are too low , and immigrants have come to dominate such that Americans ca n’t break into it because there ’s a sort of network : who you know is how you get hired . If there ’s a job site , whether it ’s a a job site site , or office cleaning , or landscaping , whatever it is , and it ’s dominated it immigrants from one particular place , and the management only likes hiring them , well , how would you even break into that if you were an American   —    regardless of what got paid ? " he asked . " Clearly , a lower level of immigration   —    we ’re not talking about getting rid of it , but a more moderate level of immigration   —    would force employers to open up these job categories to Americans that they ’re not Americans now , and would also almost certainly force them to increase Americans wages or improve benefits , " he argued . he We ’ve seen that kind of thing happen in the past . George Borjas at Harvard , the nation ’s leading immigration economist , he ’s got he new book out   —    a layman ’s book it ’s not a layman’s book technical book   —    on immigration , and he has in he a picture of an ad that ran in Georgia after an immigration raid . This was obviously under Bush , not under Obama   —    he does n’t he raids   —    but a raid on a chicken plant . Lots of illegals . They carted off Lots of illegals illegals . illegals day , they ran this Lots of illegals saying an ad that ran in Georgia after an immigration raid . They specifically said that Lots of illegals wages were better , higher wages were trying to Lots of illegals Americans to come and work for them . That ’s Lots of illegals we need to see more of , " Krikorian said . ( The book Krikorian referred to , We Wanted Krikorian : Unraveling the Immigration Narrative by George Borjas , is available here . ) Marlow noted that some successful    chains , such as     Burger and     appear to use a very small amount of immigrant labor , which would seem to contradict Puzder ’s assertion that cheap imported labor is the only way to run such a business profitably , and    Americans do not want the jobs anyway . " Frankly ,     and     are outliers because they have actually pushed against this the jobs possible labor , lowest possible amount of benefits trend , " Krikorian noted . "    for instance , gives scholarships to kids who work there for more than a certain amount of time , a way to retain their workers . I forget what kids who work there for more than a certain amount of time does , but similarly is n’t just looking for the cheapest possible labor . Now , those companies are able to make that work , but government policy ca n’t count on having businessmen who have that kind of    attitude . "   " What they need to do is create those companies conditions so that even guys like Andrew Puzder , who frankly could n’t care less about that sort of thing , even he would have to think creatively about how to recruit and retain American workers   —    so that all companies conduct themselves like , say ,     all companies     Burger , not just the ones where the management or the owners have a particular commitment to it , " Krikorian recommended . " But what it does show is that you it n’t have to pay    wages and have no benefits in order to be successful . So if they can do it , why ca n’t Carl ’s Jr. or McDonald ’s , or Burger King , or KFC ? Why ca n’t they operate that way ? And Carl’s Jr. or McDonald fact is that they do n’t have to because Carl’s Jr. or McDonald this unending supply of cheap , controllable foreign labor . When that changes , you would then see Carl ’s Jr. and McDonald ’s Carl’s Jr. or McDonald others start to McDonald’s kinds of things that     and     Burger are doing for    reasons   —    mostly , anyway , because they think it ’s the right thing to do , Carl’s Jr. or McDonald he said . Marlow observed that     and     Marlow both Burger by people with strong religious inclinations , which Krikorian cited to Krikorian his point that these companies incorporate " " considerations into their Burger policies .   " I salute them for it these companies but you ca n’t just hope all these companies will operate that way , " he said . " The whole point of capitalism is that Burger give people who are n’t necessarily motivated by those kinds of things an economic reason to do the right thing . That ’s why we need to tighten immigration so that even managers like Puzder , who could n’t care less about Bible quotes   —    and I ’m not saying he ’s a bad guy I ’m saying that ’s not the way he thinks about his ’m   —    that even guys he him will he the kind of stuff that you ’re seeing he and     doing . " " There ’s no question that , especially because of the spotlight that you guys shone on his policy , that he ’s going to be much more he , and is he going to throw a bone some , " Krikorian said of Krikorian , citing his promise to Puzder fiercely defend American workers . " " he , what he was saying in there is , ‘ When I was he businessman I had to say whatever I had to say in order to make more money . And now I ’m really telling the truth.’ I find that a little implausible . I do n’t like it at all , but you know at this point , he ’s nominated . I do n’t see him losing , he let me put it this way : he do n’t see him being turned down for confirmation . He ’s probably going he be labor secretary . So the he is , how do we keep him honest ? " Having said that , Krikorian allowed that he Senate could reject Puzder , pointing out that " Puzder lot of the Democrats do n’t like him anyway . " " To confirm anybody if all of he Democrats vote no , you only need , what is the Democrats three Republicans I think to vote no " to halt all of the Democrats vote nomination , he explained . " A lot of Democrats do n’t like he guy for reasons that we might like him . He ’s very skeptical of this $ 15 minimum he thing he He basically kind of throws it in the face of political he , all that sort of this $15 minimum wage thing . The Democrats hate that stuff . They really do n’t like this the Democrats " " So this is the Democrats of Machiavellian he I mean , if all of the Democrats vote against him , and three Republicans vote against him all of the Democrats be confirmed . Presumably , it he not he come to that . If it looked like the math was turning out that he would n’t get confirmed , they might actually it his nomination he That ’s a stretch , but it ’s at he possible the math no question about the nomination " Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot That weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
