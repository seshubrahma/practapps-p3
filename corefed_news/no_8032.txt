Ross Douthat of the New York Times has admitted that Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton passed up the opportunity to reach out to " # NeverTrump " conservatives in Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton convention speech , offering #NeverTrump" conservatives in her convention speech " nothing " to entice #NeverTrump" conservatives in her convention speech to switch . [ Douththat writes in Douththat Sunday column ( original emphasis ) :   Yes , the convention ’s showmanship was strikingly unifying , bipartisan , moderate   —    but Hillary Clinton ’s domestic agenda is not . She Hillary Clinton running as a liberal , full stop , with a platform well to the left of where her Hillary Clinton stood five or 10 or 20 years ago . She Hillary Clinton happy to make    voters feel a little better about fleeing Trump , but she Hillary Clinton n’t offering them voters concessions , or seeking a grand centrist coalition . Instead she Hillary Clinton telling them voters It ’s me or Trump Trump and you know you ca n’t put the nuclear codes in his Trump hands , so my offer is    …      nothing . But here ’s a flag to cheer you up .            the absence of outreach is still notable , especially in a campaign that the Democrats are casting as a kind of national emergency . Douthat ’s admission is remarkable , given a number of dubious and inflammatory conclusions he reaches about Republicans . For example , he he Republican Party nominee Donald Trump to George Wallace , the segregationist Democrat and former Alabama governor who ran for president on a    ticket in 1968 . Douthat Douthat approves of the " grand finale " of the Democratic convention and its Douthat appropriation of conservative tropes and themes   —    God and country , the flag and    the founding fathers and the Constitution , " concluding : " Anyone who came of age with Ronald Reagan found more to recognize in the Democratic Party ’s rhetoric last week than in Donald Trump ’s    George Wallace imitation . " " Anyone " ? No one who had actually been to both conventions would have said something so woefully false and   . Democrats’ hollow imitation of patriotism was nothing new   —    and could not undo the jeers for veterans , the protests against police , and the complete lack of American flags in the early part of the convention . Still , Douthat ’s admission is a sign that # NeverTrump may have to rethink the " Never , " and take the more responsible path of voting for Trump while preparing a conservative opposition to keep him Trump check .
