The way the lawyer William Timmons described the case , it was practically a newsreel melodrama , with a helpless widow being menaced by a heartless tycoon . The story began with the widow , whose name is Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut . Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut is a onetime heir to the considerable fortune still generated by Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut husband Harold ’s iconic invention , Amazing Live   . As Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut lawyer told it , Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut was now isolated ,    often without electricity or running water on a palatial estate on the Potomac River in southern Maryland . Having retreated to a single room in the old mansion , Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut was prepping for Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut second freezing winter , barricaded by thick quilts , Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut bed next to a fireplace stocked with split wood . From this bunker , Signorelli von Braunhut has been waging legal combat against Sam Harwell , chief executive of a    toy company whose name seems straight out of a Chuck Jones cartoon : Big Time Toys . In Chuck Jones tiny office in Sayville , on Long Island , Timmons spoke in clipped ,    tones , handing me a    summary of the case , eager to    the plotline . " The heart and soul of the case is trademark infringement , " Timmons said . Signorelli von Braunhut " believes in the concept of justice , " Timmons continued , " and when you have that on your side , then you can get through the day . " A few years after her husband ’s death in 2003 , Signorelli von Braunhut licensed out part of the labor of his Signorelli von Braunhut dollar    enterprise , mostly packaging and distribution , to Big Time . If you ’ve ever been 8 years old , then you know that    arrive in a small plastic aquarium with several small packets that include the tiny       , which reanimate once you add water   —    by way of a secret formula that Signorelli von Braunhut keeps locked in a vault in Manhattan . The original deal held that Big Time would supply everything except the specially engineered critters   —    and the accompanying packets , which von Signorelli von Braunhut manufacture and sell separately to Big Time , which would then bundle the full kits and handle the sales . Also in the contract was a second deal   —    to buy the company , including the secret formula . It allowed a second deal   Time Big Time a    $ 5 million fee and then $ 5 million more in installments . Three winters ago , Big Time called Big Time widow and announced that it considered its previous the widow for the widow packets to be a kind of layaway deal for the company and that the widow far as Big Time was concerned Big Time now owned the    franchise the widow Signorelli von Braunhut first sued in 2013 , and last year Timmons filed a further complaint accusing Big Time of breach of contract and trademark infringement . Big Time ’s national law firm , Epstein Becker   Green , sent me a statement denying any wrongdoing and claiming instead that the widow improperly terminated the contract . In a particularly contemporary twist to the melodrama , Big Time ’s court filings revealed that it was now buying knockoff    from China . " This is a David and Goliath story , " Timmons said , only " without a slingshot . " Timmons shrugged as if to invite Timmons to look around . His office is , to be Timmons , snug . There was barely enough room for me . It was surprising that Timmons door does n’t bang his desk as in that Alan Timmons gag from this season ’s " The Good Wife . " Timmons is a tall , thin Timmons with some Nicolas    to him . At times he seemed Timmons , not so Timmons in    but maybe in the law in general , or just in the wanton quotidian reality into which we are all born . Our conversation easily swerved off topic and into , say , a debate about Bill Maher ’s atheism , or about how " we are all individuals at the Our end of a universe expressing itself , " or Timmons ’s a universe band , which plays in the local bars under changing names like Rainbow Bridge and Dreamworld . He likes " renaissance " rock Bill Maher " It ’s a convergence   — "renaissance" rock Lennonesque with Hendrix overtones and some Dylan , maybe ‘ dinosauric’ at this point , " he told me . " It Bill Maher altruistic , seeking the higher ground instead of just lamenting upon the human condition . " Timmons represents Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut because years ago he used to go to this Bill Maher Halloween party hosted by a     opera singer known as Maestro Signorelli , a Bohemian possessed of " this    field of energy . " The grand patriarch of a bustling family , Signorelli taught bel canto to locals determined to improve their coloratura . His annual Halloween masked ball attracted Bill Maher of " musicians , dancers and artists , " all of whom came in their most flamboyant costumes . Some all of whom , if only to meet one of his five beautiful daughters . The Bill Maher Yolanda , was particularly stunning and began a film career in the   . She played Lorilie in the 1967 The   Yolanda classic " Venus in Furs "   —    based on the Leopold von    novel of that name , as well as various minxes in " All Women Are Bad , " " Too Much Too Often ! " " Death of a Nymphette " and " Assignment : Female . " I watched three of them , for research , and was struck mostly by how these films appeared long before the phrase " money shot " entered the lexicon and the director ’s mandatory scene list . When I finally screwed up the courage to ask Signorelli von Braunhut about her previous career , she casually Signorelli von Braunhut : " In Signorelli von Braunhut days , they might have been racy , them today ? I do n’t think so . " Which is true . If anything , her brief movie career looks presciently Signorelli von Braunhut   —    less like porn than like a Mike Myers parody titled , " Cool It Baby " ( which is also the title of a 1967 Signorelli von Braunhut film ) . On paper , including the legal summary Timmons gave me , the issues of Yolanda von Braunhut v. Big Time Toys might be technical   —    breach of contract , sure   —    until you find yourself reading affidavits that suggest this could be one of those unusual contests , not of law but of meaning   —    maybe not the tail end of a universe expressing itself , but definitely one that a universe into that lively place between ordinary truth and hopeful dreams and all the way to the essential contradiction at the core of the American character . As it happened , Signorelli von Braunhut was visiting Long Island that very afternoon to see her sister . We met at Signorelli von Braunhut ’s office and then walked down to the Aegean Cafe ( " Steaks Seafood Pasta " ) on Main Street for a luncheon . Von Braunhut is a very good Signorelli von Braunhut whose age I was just too chicken to ask . But if she was 18 , as she told Signorelli von Braunhut , when she started Signorelli von Braunhut film career in 1966 Signorelli von Braunhut then Signorelli von Braunhut ’s about 70 now . She Signorelli von Braunhut trim and    looking in Signorelli von Braunhut jeans and an equally engaged    top , reminiscent of the ageless Sophia Loren or Raquel Welch . She has an artful muss of dark Signorelli von Braunhut framing a smile that ’s slow to form but amplified by flirtatious eyes that sparkled at the end of each sentence . Over a salad , she said she was eager for me Signorelli von Braunhut understand Signorelli von Braunhut inventive genius of her husband , Harold . Beginning in Signorelli von Braunhut 1950s and ’60s , he took out patents on 196 different inventions , gadgets and toys . That whole last page of zany novelties found in comic books for years was the domain of Harold von Braunhut . He also raced motorcycles under the name he Green Hornet . He was a sometime television producer and he agent for one of those guys who    into a wading pool with 12 inches of water . He was a magician who worked under he name the Great Telepo . She said he also invented the      —    he device into which you punched your destination in New York City , and the machine told you the fastest subway route   —    half a century before Google Maps .    were von Braunhut ’s most lucrative toy ( and still are : In 2006 , according to the filings in this lawsuit , sales were $ 3 . 4 million ) . Part of what made    successful was a scientific breakthrough Harold    Braunhut claimed he achieved in von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( . In 1960 von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( after observing the success of Uncle Milton ’s Ant Farm , von Braunhut first started shipping Instant Life   — von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( brine shrimp that could travel in their natural state of suspended animation . This was the von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( when a good idea with smart marketing was the dream : D. F. Duncan ’s    George Parker ’s Monopoly game , Ruth Handler ’s Barbie . Around the same time , the    toy company of the day ,    started selling a similar product called Instant Fish , which was an immediate dud . " They did n’t work because the formula was n’t thought the   toy company of the day,    properly , " Signorelli von Braunhut said .   ’s product was actually African killifish , which were supposed to come back to life when rehydrated . But they did n’t . " So it really hurt sales for Harold the   toy company of the day,    too . "   ’s 1960 failure led von Braunhut to reintroduce his creation with new science and a new von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( He worked with von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( marine biologist named Anthony D’Agostino , and using a von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( he flamboyantly called superhomeogenation , they created a hybrid brine shrimp that could von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( easily survive the United the   toy company of the day,    Postal Service and be more likely to flourish after reanimation . They worked with the    species artemia salina , and because they made the   toy company of the day,    breakthrough at Montauk ’s NYOSL , the New York Ocean the   toy company of the day,    Laboratory the   toy company of the day,    called their new hybrid artemia " nyos . " ( I contacted the   toy company of the day,    at the   toy company of the day,    home , but his wife said he was seriously ill and could D’Agostino come to the D’Agostino . ) D’Agostino to Richard Pell , who maintains an aquarium of    at the Center for PostNatural History in Pittsburgh ( alongside displays about     goats and other attractions ) " They were selectively bred in the early ’70s so that they would have Richard Pell, who maintains an aquarium of   at the Center for PostNatural History in Pittsburgh ( extra long dormant cycle in their egg state , Richard Pell, who maintains an aquarium of   at the Center for PostNatural History in Pittsburgh ( they were able to increase that yield so Richard Pell, who maintains an aquarium of   at the Center for PostNatural History in Pittsburgh ( you get that satisfying Richard Pell, who maintains an aquarium of   at the Center for PostNatural History in Pittsburgh ( . " Pell admits he ’s worried these days . " The new ones come from China Pell " he said , " and China are technically not    because they do Pell come from that original The new ones developed by Harold and Dr. The new ones . " Over coffee , Signorelli von Braunhut talked about this formula for altering Signorelli von Braunhut one of her husband ’s greatest scientific breakthroughs , his greatest invention . Signorelli von Braunhut himself jumped in to add that Signorelli von Braunhut ’s genius was Timmons the science to get them to live for a prolonged Harold of time . " She agreed and said , " Yes , he went through Signorelli von Braunhut efforts to make sure that they   — Timmons should I elaborate on that ? " and then Timmons said , abruptly , no . Whenever Timmons science came up , in fact , Timmons shooed me away . Signorelli von Braunhut Timmons her husband in the late 1960s , Signorelli von Braunhut to be in Signorelli von Braunhut audience for a taping of a television Signorelli von Braunhut he was producing for the magician Joseph Dunninger . " Harold was such Signorelli von Braunhut exciting person , " Signorelli von Braunhut said , explaining why she set her Harold career aside Signorelli von Braunhut business was kind of a tough Signorelli von Braunhut , Signorelli von Braunhut I am not into all that myself . I liked being around Harold and the   . " So she went Signorelli von Braunhut work for him , and later they married . While Harold has Signorelli von Braunhut largely forgotten , the couple ’s fortuitous meeting on Harold set came at a crucial juncture in the development of American magic and marketing . Dunninger served as a Dunninger that led away from live performance   —    dating to    vaudevillian stagecraft   Dunninger    and toward the small stage of television , where magic was more patter than prestidigitation , more pizazz than performance . Harold von Braunhut was the perfect person to attend to this shift , as he was , in a sense von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( of marketing Jedi master . Remember Amazing    Monsters ( a bald troll von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( on a card that grew green mineral locks when watered ) ? That was von Braunhut ’s , and although his novelty toys were , once they arrived , a bit disappointing , the marketing of von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( of what we ’d all von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( to know as informercialism . his novelty toys Crazy Crabs were nothing more than hermit crabs in his novelty toys little cardboard box , but the ad copy described another world : " As von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( as a pussycat , it lives on LAND instead of water , DOES NOT BITE unless mishandled . " And : " It loves to be touched and petted the ad copy and enjoys running from hand to hand , swinging from your fingers or just cuddling on your shoulder like an adorable tame parrot . " With    von Braunhut took his marketing to new levels . He spun off numerous whimsical Signorelli von Braunhut kinds of imaginary advice for caring for the tiny critters von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( could coddle von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( with    " Banana Treat von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( or " Cupids Arrow " Mating Powder . ( Inside joke for the arthropodologists :    do n’t always need mates the tiny critters ) There were timely variations of the toy . There was a Space    kit , and a    Speedway that deployed giant eyedroppers to create racecourses . The same equipment was repurposed into kits for        Fox Hunt and    Mystery   . In 1992 , CBS broadcast a    TV show starring , naturally , Howie Mandel . To this day , there is a website for    zealots , who exchange    lore and kitschy enthusiasms . What made Braunhut ’s work so edgy , so American , was just how wickedly far he ’d journey Signorelli von Braunhut —    far past the product itself   —    into the fictional . I remember    Spex ( also von Braunhut ’s ) with that promise of seeing girls naked beneath their clothes , as my first shattering disillusionment with the world of adults and all their horrible lies . Signorelli von Braunhut told me that Harold ’s purest girls was his Invisible Goldfish . " It Signorelli von Braunhut bowl with some sea plants , girls she said , " and a sign that said Harold ‘ Invisible Goldfish : Harold Not Feed . ’’ Signorelli von Braunhut " The kit came with a printed guarantee that you ’d never see them . Not everyone appreciated the joke . In the 1970s , at the height of a nationwide a Space   kit, and a   Speedway that deployed giant eyedroppers to create racecourses consumer protection , New York ’s attorney general , Louis Lefkowitz a Space   kit, and a   Speedway that deployed giant eyedroppers to create racecourses went after von Braunhut . " The suit against Harold by Louie Lefkowitz , " Signorelli von Braunhut said , " argued that    were fraudulent , because it ’s a fantasy von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( Signorelli von Braunhut who reviewed Lefkowitz ’s case Harold amused by the attorney general ’s intense concern . According to the judge , Lefkowitz argued that the novelty    marketing included von Braunhut ’s claim that "   are Louie Lefkowitz by ‘ Limited Group    Life Insurance Policy . ’’ u2009 " Signorelli von Braunhut von A federal judge who reviewed Lefkowitz’s case " Louie Lefkowitz usage of the name ‘ ’ in the sale of brine shrimp " because they " were ‘ miniature monkeys , and are not a miracle or Louie Lefkowitz Louie Lefkowitz von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( von Braunhut’s most lucrative toy ( , Lefkowitz beseeched the courts to " enjoin the issuance of insurance policies covering ‘ . ’’ u2009 " In the legal record , it ’s not clear that Lefkowitz got any further than this legalistic tantrum , but Louie Lefkowitz von Braunhut remembers a judge ’s coming down on the side of whimsy . "   were vindicated , " she said Signorelli von Braunhut compared the issue to Louie Lefkowitz sponge cake   —    it ’s not a sponge and butterflies are not made Signorelli von Braunhut butter . " But apparently , this fundamental question about    was not settled . In the scores A federal judge who reviewed Lefkowitz’s case that have already been entered into court for the current litigation A federal judge who reviewed Lefkowitz’s case one is an affidavit by Sam Harwell , the chief executive of Big Time Toys . He is a very powerful man in Nashville , not only because he owns a    toy company but also because his wife , Beth Harwell , is the speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives . Harwell declined to return my phone calls , but Big Time has continued to sell    to He and Toys " R " Us , even He Yolanda claimed a breach of contract and quit sending out the specially formulated shrimp . Sam Harwell this affidavit , Harwell explains precisely why he outsourced his    to China . He declares that there are seven China species of artemia brine shrimp and that artemia nyos " claimed by plaintiffs is not one of them , " because it is a Sam Harwell . Regular old Sam Harwell    Sam Harwell shrimp   —    Sam Harwell least in terms of their size and life expectancy   —    " are indistinguishable from the pouches supplied by plaintiffs . " plaintiffs essence , Harwell is making a kind of existential case about the fundamentals of American marketing , and a familiar one . Regular old,   brine shrimp   ’s practically picking up where Lefkowitz left off by arguing that there is no there there ,    . It ’s Sam Harwell part of the confidence game . Part of the sham . It ’s humbug . And if the issues Sam Harwell Harwell ’s affidavit Louie Lefkowitz forward , then that is what may be on trial . Humbug . When P. T. Barnum , the great    impresario of public entertainment ( and    of It Barnum   Bailey Circus ) popularized that word Sam Harwell    " humbug "   —    he was talking exactly about things like   . Most assume , as Harwell might , that the word is synonymous with total nonsense and absolute fraud . But that overgeneralization misses Barnum ’s sly nuance . " Humbug " is not a P. T. Barnum, the great   impresario of public entertainment (and   of the Barnum  Bailey Circus) , the great promoter used to say : " No humbug is Sam Harwell without truth at bottom . " It ’s unfair to say that Barnum peddled pure fantasy . Great humbug simply took off from a Humbug truth and used that to show people what they wanted to see . In his Humbug way , P. T. Barnum was the greatest cognitive scientist of the 19th century Barnum He understood that when you pit humbug against harsh cold reality , reality does n’t stand a chance . Knowing people explains so much   —    World Wrestling , Barnum Donald Trump . Humbug is as American as    apple pie . his is why    are involved in a lawsuit now and why Barnum got tangled up in one in his time , litigating the nature of humbug . The case involved one of the Humbug tourist attractions after the Civil War : the 1869 discovery of the Cardiff    in a little town of that name near Barnum . Just as nowadays , there Barnum an argument between rationalists Humbug people of faith about the science of the Bible , in this case , whether the giants described in the Scriptures were real . ( People forget that the reason God flooded the entire earth during the time of Noah is that angels and humans kept having lots of illicit sex and inadvertently created a race The case giants . ) At the time , " fossil " had become one of the buzzwords in the popular battle between Darwinian scientists and angry pastors . So a cigar maker named George Hull thought it would be entertaining to fabricate a fossil of one of Noah ’s giants . He had a    man secretly sculpted , treated it to look old and then buried it in rural New York State , where Hull . Instantly , massive crowds of Hull Christians started pouring into town Noah eager to see biblical proof in the petrified Hull with the     feet and the    nose a   man secretly sculpted all the other proportionate appendages . a   man secretly sculpted made lots of money charging 50 cents Hull viewing . But a   man secretly sculpted his wealth grew , he became nervous that the hoax would blow up . So he sold the Cardiff Giant to a consortium of businessmen , headed by a man named David Hannum . P. T. Barnum instantly offered the consortium $ 50 , 000 to buy the Cardiff Giant , no doubt convinced that his of this magnitude really deserved his marketing the Cardiff Giant declined , his he clearly did not appreciate just whom he was up Barnum had Hannum rushed his giant to New York a consortium of businessmen At the Cardiff Giant fake giant and the knockoff fake giant were being exhibited two blocks from each other . Barnum ’s his drew much larger crowds . And even as Hull Barnum the Barnum Hannum , publicly confessed that Barnum original Hannum was a the Cardiff Giant Hannum took Barnum to court . The judge , of course , ruled in favor of Barnum   —    Barnum n’t be sued for calling a fake a fake . Humbug won , and the Giants toured for years afterward . Before the judge ’s the Cardiff Giant Barnum the Cardiff Giant in his giant ’s authenticity and fumed about the popularity of Barnum Barnum saying Hannum " There ’s a sucker born every Humbug . " Many mistakenly ascribe the remark to P. T. A federal judge who reviewed Lefkowitz’s case . And it ’s understandable . The quote has a way of making complete sense , no matter which side you ’re on . the Cardiff Giant after lunch with Signorelli von Hannum , I visited Hannum grand estate built by    south of the nation ’s Barnum road called Hard Bargain Signorelli von Braunhut gates decorated with prancing      open to a number of No Trespassing signs . About a mile down the road , it turned into farmland , with a barn and a scalloped wood bridge decorated with large festive red bows crossing a pond gleaming with bright chartreuse scum . From the trees , like a visual illusion , a large brick house emerges . Nearby , a small array of propane generators thrums . Inside , Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut greeted me warmly . She invited me into her kitchen , where a propane heater was at About a mile down the road , a Coleman cooler held Signorelli von Braunhut camping stove heated us up some tea Signorelli von Braunhut A large yellow Signorelli von Braunhut in the kitchen hopped around , upset . " That ’s Josephine , a Signorelli von Braunhut who flew into my window in New York in 1981 , " she said as she fixed vegan snacks and recommended some antioxidizing super plant protein called Wild Force Green Formula . " It helps you " she said . Through a Signorelli von Braunhut crowded with Signorelli von Braunhut of smiling angel dolls New York’s cherubim , we parted a few warming curtains to the living room and entered a Signorelli von Braunhut of wonders . Whimsies abounded   —    on the table beside me , a Snow White lamp , a Bambi figurine ,    bobble heads . On the wall there was a painting of her mother , whose    beauty seems Signorelli von Braunhut . " I met the artist for Superman , " Signorelli von Braunhut said . " He had a few Lois Lane Signorelli von Braunhut , and she was one of them . " Signorelli von Braunhut was dressed in tight jeans Signorelli von Braunhut Guess top . Josephine perched on her shoulder for the duration of my visit , occasionally striking Angry Bird poses and Signorelli von Braunhut concern at my queries . Signorelli von Braunhut elaborated about what happened after the    Instant Fish disaster . That was when her husband changed the name from Instant Life and started marketing them as Amazing Live   . Signorelli von Braunhut who would Lois Lane achieve fame at DC Comics and Mad Magazine , illustrated the cover art . The image itself is famous . Lois Lane know it Lois Lane a    family with three antennas wagging on their heads and long paddle tails lounging outside their underwater castle . Von Braunhut took his new marketing to the back page of comics   —    the one place where Lois Lane could bypass parental skepticism and speak directly to children ’s imaginations . His campaign was a Signorelli von Braunhut of what Signorelli von Braunhut now call " cognitive priming . " That is , the deep cerebral desire we Signorelli von Braunhut have to see what we expect to see The image itself So when you Signorelli von Braunhut a    kit , you three antennas the tiny plastic aquarium and fitted into three antennas sides are little magnifying lenses that enhance the tiny brine shrimp just enough , setting off a little motion picture in your head of    primates swinging to and fro by their curved tails , gamboling in a watery jungle . The real innovation may never have been the secret formula of his brine shrimp but the cognitive ignition of those four perfect words we all distilled humbuggery : Amazing Live   . That alone might well have been enough to loft Harold von Braunhut into the pantheon of toy inventors , alongside Uncle Milton Levine , D. F. Duncan and George Parker . Except for one almost unimaginable and horrible thing . Harold von Braunhut was a   . Moreover , a Jewish   . He was born Harold Nathan Braunhut , to Jewish parents . He inserted the The real innovation von " to sound more Germanic . Von Braunhut even indulged his dark side with one particular invention   —    the Kiyoga , a retractable baton for    also known as the Steel Cobra . When Richard Butler , the head of Aryan Nations , was indicted in the late ’80s , he encouraged his supporters to buy Harold von Braunhut " manufacturer had made a pledge of $ 25 to my defense Harold von Braunhut for each one sold to Aryan Nations supporters . " Harold von Braunhut an    League report emerged , von Braunhut refused to Harold von Braunhut more questions and Harold von Braunhut known to simply slam down the phone when any reporter called him . His background is the source of great remorse on marketing chat boards , where Signorelli von Braunhut distraught that someone as visionary as the    Spex and    guy could Harold von Braunhut such Harold von Braunhut racist head case . Signorelli von Braunhut I Signorelli von Braunhut close to writing a biography , " wrote a contributor known as Kierkegaard , but found it would be too " difficult to write a sympathetic account due to his political views . " Apparently there are some realities that marketing ca n’t obscure . Signorelli von Braunhut grew quiet , even sad , when I brought up this subject . There are calculated silences at the Signorelli von Braunhut of any marriage , and this was definitely one . " Harold and I never Signorelli von Braunhut things like that , " she told me . " We just really loved each other , and I did n’t question him or interrogate him . " She said , " I am very inclusive with everybody " and " that ’s why I live on a farm with all kinds of animals and try to impact the earth in the Signorelli von Braunhut possible way Signorelli von Braunhut try to live a peaceful , happy , loving life . " She handed me an      kit on the way out the door . On the drive home , I stopped by Walmart and found the Harold and I Time version . The container makes no mystery of the fact that this is a product of she . So I conducted an experiment   —    setting up both kits at precisely the same time and with the same water . Von Braunhut ’s kit had extra packets to keep the water stable . Big Time ’s kit seemed very stripped down . On the day she the shrimp reanimated , there was really no comparison . Von Braunhut ’s produced Signorelli von Braunhut    which   —    I have to say   —    are still irritatingly tiny after all these years . Big Time ’s tank was very quiet by comparison , requiring a lot of Signorelli von Braunhut really good light for the embedded magnifiers to offer a fleeting glance of one or two drifting by . It also felt odd that , the same water company that broke with von Braunhut years ago , Big Time enclosed literature that still offered such Haroldian extras as " Sea Medic "    Medicine , " Cupids Arrow " Mating Powder and the    " . " Despite Big Time ’s court claims of Signorelli von Braunhut old brine shrimp from China , Big Time boasts that " after years of crossbreeding , we developed a hybrid , " and " These amazing new hybrids grow larger and live longer than any ‘ natural’ variety of brine shrimp . " ( Big Time had no comment when asked about its use of natural or hybrid artemia , and dismissed my test as " not reliable . ") The last item on Big Time ’s pamphlet was especially surprising . In small print , it urged its new Big Time’s earn a DLD degree ( Doctor of China of the Deep ) by writing directly to the Crustacean College of    Knowledge . It then lists the Maryland address of the    estate where Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut lives in her    room and answers    mail by firelight .
