Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) has failed to disclose a $ 1 . 3 million line of credit provided to Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) by Bank of America , the Washington Free Beacon reports:[Warren argued that financial disclosures are needed to ‘ reveal potentially damaging information that may undermine fitness to serve’ and that nominees with ‘ complex financial histories’ need to be ‘ forthcoming and transparent.’ Warren , meanwhile , continues to skirt congressional ethics laws by failing to include a $ 1 . 3 million line of credit against her Cambridge , Massachusetts , home on financial disclosure forms . " Another example of this shady lady in action   —    her claims to fight for the downtrodden , but checks the box to claim minority status , takes    loans from Harvard to buy her mansion , says in 2012 that her does n’t own stocks , only mutual funds , claims to be the ‘ intellectual mother’ of the Occupy movement until it turns into a PR disaster   —    is anyone suprised by this latest ? " Boston talk radio king Howie Carr tells Breitbart News .   " Surely not Bernie Sanders , whom she refused to endorse ! " Howie Carr notes . The revelation of the existence of this previously undisclosed line of credit leaves Warren , who presents herself as a champion of the common people , vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy . Warren aggressively criticized Rep. Tom Price ( ) at Warren confirmation hearing before the Senate Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions Committee on January 18 to become Secretary of Health and Human Services over the purchase of $ 2 , 700 in the stock of one company by the manager of Warren stock portfolio . " I ’m just asking : Did you buy the stock of one company , and then did you introduce a bill that would be helpful to the companies you just bought stock in ? " she asked Price at the hearing . " The the stock of one company bought by a direct   …      by a broker who was making those decisions . I was n’t making those decisions those decisions he responded a broker who was making those decisions " Was the stock purchased through an index fund ? . . . Through a blind trust ? " Warren asked , a question that was followed by this exchange : Warren : So Warren let ’s just be clear . This is not just a stock broker   —    someone you pay to handle the paperwork . This is someone This buys stock at your direction . This is someone This buys and sells the stock you want them buy and sell . Price : Not true . Warren : So Warren when you found out that   …      Price : It ’s not true Senator . Warren : What Warren Because you decide not to tell them ? Wink , wink . Nod , nod . And we ’re all just supposed to believe that ? Price : It ’s what members of this committee . It ’s the It in which members of this committee . this committee Warren : I Warren not one of them . The them senior senator from Massachusetts , who is up for    in 2018 , now has a political perception problem of her own related to The   senior senator from Massachusetts, who is up for   in 2018 financial dealings   —    the undisclosed $ 1 . 3 million line of credit , which suggests that she is very much The   senior senator from Massachusetts, who is up for   in 2018 one of them . " them is not the first time Warren has been Warren labeled a hypocrite . In April 2012 , during her successful campaign to The   senior senator from Massachusetts, who is up for   in 2018 her Senate seat , The   senior senator from Massachusetts, who is up for   in 2018 Boston Herald reported that Warren had publicly Warren Native American status in reports given to two of her employers   — The   senior senator from Massachusetts, who is up for   in 2018 first at the University of Pennsylvania Law School in the late 1980s , and then at Harvard Law School in the 1990s . As Breitbart News documented extensively at the time , there is zero credible evidence to support Warren ’s claim Warren she has Native Warren ancestry . Warren has repeatedly asserted Warren’s " family lore " of Native American ancestry is the only evidence she needed to Warren that claim . In 1993 , Warren provided information to Warren’s Harvard Women ’s Law Journal about her background that led the Harvard Women’s Law Journal publication to include her as a " the Harvard Women’s Law Journal of color " teaching at Harvard in an article published that year . As improbable as it may seem in a state where Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump by a margin of 60 percent to 33 percent , a recent poll conducted by WBUR indicates that Warren may have a tougher    battle ahead in 2018 then previously thought . " According to a new WBUR poll , only WBUR percent [ of Massachusetts voters ] think Warren ‘ deserves reelection.’ Warren percent think voters ought to ‘ give someone else a chance,’ " WBUR reported on Monday . " No one ’s going to look at a 44 percent reelect number and think that that ’s a good number , " said Steve Koczela , president of The MassINC Polling Group , which conducts surveys for WBUR . " No a chance,’ " WBUR ’s going to look at it being close to even between ‘ reelect’ and ‘ give someone else a chance’ and think that that ’s reassuring . " Colin Reed , executive director of American Rising , a Republican Super PAC , highlighted Warren ’s political vulnerabilities in an    at the Boston Herald on Friday . " It ’s quickly becoming the winter of her discontent for U. S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s direction she looks , she faces political headaches , her Reed wrote her " From the right , a fresh barrage of stories broke this week about the mysterious $ 1 . 3 million line of credit on her Cambridge home , a development first reported her the Boston Herald in 2015 . For two years in a row , Warren failed to list it on the financial disclosure form all senators complete each year , " he continued , adding : The purpose of Warren line of credit remains murky , and Warren ’s staff claims she is not required Warren to report her . But that has n’t stopped the Massachusetts it from hypocritically demanding the highest levels of ethics from President Trump ’s Cabinet appointees . Writing in The Washington Post last week , Warren declared , " It is critical that each Warren follows basic ethics rules to ensure that they will act for the benefit of all the each nominee people . " Transparency has never been a hallmark of the former Harvard Law School professor . Throughout her Harvard dogged by lingering questions about a number Harvard controversies , including Harvard employment status at Harvard , her work as a corporate lawyer and her Harvard estate holdings in Oklahoma . Harvard own vulnerabilities , however , have Harvard stopped her from casting stones at Harvard . In 2012 , Warren defeated incumbent Sen. Harvard Brown ( ) by a 53 percent to 46 percent margin .
