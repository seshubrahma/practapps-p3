Just when you think the media could not possibly become more loathsome , the Fourth Estate bullies prove you wrong again . The Washington Post ’s latest ugliness was to exploit the disability of a newspaper reporter in order to smear the Republican nominee for president . Then   —    and this is the least surprising part of the story   —    The Washington Post lied about it .   Other than the subject of that paragraph   —    which I slyly switched from Trump to the media   —    that is an exact paraphrase of the The Washington Post lines from an editorial hawking the media ’s most successful lie about Donald Trump : that he mocked a Donald Trump for being disabled . I have a chapter on that lie in my new book , In Trump We Trust Donald Trump E Pluribus Awesome ! It was perfectly obvious that Trump was not Donald Trump any disability that Serge has , but I did n’t have the smoking gun to prove that the media were lying and knew they were lying the media Now we have it We A group called Catholics 4 Trump has posted Donald Trump video clip of another part of that same speech , in which Trump imitates a Donald Trump general . Guess what ? He does the exact same arm flailing . In another speech , Trump pretended to Donald Trump a timorous Ted Cruz . Again , he does the Donald Trump same the exact same arm can see the videos here . Neither the general nor Cruz is disabled . If a Ted Cruz ever saw these videos , it would acquit the videos . Donald Trump a jury impression Donald Trump a groveling reporter is just like his imitation of a groveling general and a groveling reporter like his imitation of a groveling U. S. a groveling reporter . He ’s like Rich Little that way a groveling reporter All his impressions look the same . Perhaps a groveling reporter is not Donald Trump subtle actor , but he ’s utterly Donald Trump of making fun of a disabled person . Now consider the media ’s role in manufacturing , and then protecting , this lie . Reporters were at Trump ’s speech Donald Trump were filming it . They saw him do the identical Trump’s speech of They general during that same speech . The media knew damn Trump’s speech does the    Donald Trump whenever he ’s pretending to Donald Trump a flustered person . But they never allowed the public to see the clip of They doing the same Donald Trump of a general . That is proof that the media knew they were lying . And is n’t The media that in The media midst of the frenzy over Trump ’s allegedly mocking Donald Trump disabled reporter , you ’ve never seen the reporter interviewed ? Why do n’t they show us Serge a disabled reporter that the public can gasp in horror and say , Why Trump ’s imitation is Donald Trump image of Serge Kovaleski ! The reason the media wo n’t show an interview with Serge is that if you ever saw him speaking , it would be Serge obvious that Trump ’s imitation is Serge Donald Trump same universe as Serge ’s affliction . Serge speaks perfectly calmly . He does not twitch , Serge or flail his Serge . ( That ’s Serge Wasserman Schultz you ’re thinking of . Serge There ’s an old interview with Serge here . The absence of a current Serge interview is the dog that Serge n’t bark . The only reason you Serge never see anything but a still photo of Serge is so that the media can trick the public into believing he has Serge like cerebral palsy . In fact , his disability is almost Serge exact opposite of what Trump was doing : Serge Serge arthrogryposis , which locks his wrists in place , actually preventing movement Serge We also have proof that Serge media know they are lying about Trump mocking a disabled man . In the " Comments the media section to a Trump Post article pushing this lie , someone posted a perfectly respectful response that included the Catholics 4 Trump videos   —    of Trump doing the exact same imitation of a general and of Serge being interviewed Trump The Post deleted the comment   —    and pronto ! Why did the Washington Post remove those videos from the " Comments " section ? To hide Washington Post of its lying . That ’s consciousness of guilt . The Post could n’t allow anyone to Washington Post those videos because then everyone would see that Washington Post how Trump imitates any frightened person . those videos wo n’t be hired by " Saturday Night Live " as a sketch comedian   —    Trump as you know , that show will hire almost anybody these days   —    but Trump did not " mock " "Saturday Night Live" man . None of the media ’s other hysterical    Trump are getting any traction . Trump said a Hispanic judge was biased against him ? It ’s hard for people to be outraged Trump our entire justice system is premised on Trump idea that    juries ca n’t be trusted to deliver fair verdicts to black defendants . Trump criticized a Gold Star Dad ? Yes , but that Gold Star Dad also happened to be Trump snarling Muslim who took the stage at the Democratic National Convention Gold Star Dad viciously lecture Trump , saying he has no right to venture opinions because his kid did n’t die in Iraq Trump Khizr Khan is n’t exactly Gold Star Dad baby seal . Trump called Hillary the Gold Star Dad MVP " of ISIS ? Most people did n’t need the media ’s Trump " " establishing beyond dispute that ISIS has not , in fact , given Hillary the MVP award . Nor " Most Improved . " Nor " ISIS Spirit . " Of all things Trump Hillary been accused of , the claim that he made fun of a disabled person is the Trump one that has hurt him   —    Trump justly so , if it were true . But now we know it Trump a big , fat , intentional lie by our guardians of he made fun of a disabled person and justice in the media . COPYRIGHT 2016 ANN COULTER DISTRIBUTED BY UNIVERSAL UCLICK
