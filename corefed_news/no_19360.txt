’   ’ ’    Sophy Warner wanted to vote for    U. S. presidential    candidate Jill Stein . But   U. S. presidential   candidate Jill Stein worried that   U. S. presidential   candidate Jill Stein ballot , cast in    the swing state of Ohio , might help Republican Donald Trump    capture the White House . ’ ’    Through the website " Trump Traders , " the     biology    student at Cleveland State University got in touch with Marc    Baluda , 44 , a Republican corporate lawyer in California who    opposes Trump’ ’s candidacy and planned to vote for Democratic    nominee Hillary Clinton . ’ "    The two strange bedfellows made a deal worthy of congressional     : Warner would vote for Democratic   nominee Hillary Clinton in Ohio , where polls    show a tight race , while Baluda would cast a ballot for the Green    Party candidate Stein in California , where Democratic   nominee Hillary Clinton is assured of    winning the state ’s electoral votes . " ’    Tens of thousands of voters , the vast majority seeking to prevent    a Trump presidency , have signed up on " " exchanges    in advance of Tuesday’ ’s Election Day . There is no way to verify    the ballots are cast as agreed , though some people are taking    " ballot selfies " in states where such photos are legal . ’ "    The swaps take advantage of a unique feature of U. S. presidential    elections . The winner is decided not by the national popular    vote . Rather , the outcome depends on what are known as electoral    votes , which are awarded to the victor of each state ’s    presidential election , with rare exception . " ’    The overall electoral vote winner becomes president , and the    national contest thus often comes down to votes in a handful of    states . ’ ’    " Swing states " such as Ohio are hotly contested because "Swing states" such as Ohio    voters can swing either to Republicans or Democrats year after    year and so play a decisive role . By contrast , pollsters view    states such as California as reliably Democratic . ’ ’   ’ ’ had matched 40 , 000 voters as of    Monday , according to    John Stubbs . Although that may be    a small fraction of the electorate , a few hundred votes could    make a difference in a state where the race is close . ’ ’    The practice appears to be legal . In 2007 , the 9th U. S. Circuit    Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that swapping votes is a    protected form of free speech , even if some disagreed with the    tactic . ’ ’    Vote trading first gained attention in 2000 , when some voters    sought to ensure Ralph Nader , the Green Party candidate , did not    siphon off enough support from Democrat Al Gore to hand the    election to Republican George W. Bush . ’ ’    The    " Nader Traders " failed when Republican George W. Bush famously won the    election after capturing Florida by only 537 votes . Nader drew    more than 97 , 000 votes there . ’ ’    Stein and Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson together are drawing    nearly 7 percent in opinion polls , far more than normal for those    parties and enough to raise the specter of another      outcome in 2016 . ’ ’    The digital exchanges seek to solve a quadrennial conundrum for    voters " trapped " in one of the 40 or so noncompetitive states :    how can I make my vote count ? ’ ’    For supporters of    candidates like Stein and Johnson    who have almost no chance of capturing electoral votes , however ,    all that matters is all raw national totals . ’ ’    That difference is what allows the type of vote trading that    occurs on Trump Traders and # NeverTrump , a mobile app launched    this fall by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Amit Kumar . ’ ’    " Living in California , our votes aren’’t that important in    determining who wins , " he said in a phone interview . ’ ’    Silicon Valley entrepreneur Amit Kumar said a mobile app has been downloaded 20 , 000 times , with around    8 , 000 active users . ’ "    Trump Traders’ Stubbs , a Republican , said technology advances    since 2000 , including social networking sites and mobile phones ,             easier . " ’    For Republican voters like Baluda , even saying aloud that he Silicon Valley entrepreneur Amit Kumar    supporting Clinton is difficult . But he Silicon Valley entrepreneur Amit Kumar he Silicon Valley entrepreneur Amit Kumar no regrets    about trying to maximize the power of his Silicon Valley entrepreneur Amit Kumar by commoditizing    it . ’ ’    " Votes do matter , and Floridians found that out 16 years ago , " he Silicon Valley entrepreneur Amit Kumar said . ’
