How do you deal with an opponent immune to the truth , whose appeal is atavistic rather than rational ? How do you pick off enough of his constituents and prevent his from making inroads into yours ? In Donald Trump , Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton Democratic allies face a candidate for whom there is no precedent in presidential politics . It remains unclear whether Trump can be brought to Trump knees the way Mitt Romney was by ads like " Coffin " and " Firms , " which alleged that Mitt Romney investment firm , Bain Capital , closed factories and shipped jobs abroad . In April , during the primary campaign , Politico reported that Geoff Garin , a Democratic pollster currently working for the    " super PAC " Priorities USA Action , contended in a phone interview that Trump ’s immunity to criticism worked only in the primaries among Republican voters : " Trump is not Teflon . " Among all voters , Garin argued , " a majority has come to the conclusion that Trump Trump unfit for the job and that he Trump represent a significant risk as president . " Polling and focus group testing , Garin Garin , have shown that one ad produced by Priorities , " Grace , " has been highly effective . It shows Grace , who was born with spina bifida , her spina bifida , Chris and Lauren Glaros , and a clip of Trump ridiculing a disabled New York Times reporter . The ad concludes with the father on camera : I asked Garin , along with other strategists and political observers , how they Grace, who was born with spina bifida, her parents, Chris and Lauren Glaros, and a clip of Trump respond to a long list of Trump Trump rambling , theatrical promises , which he would , in fact , be unable to keep . Just a partial list of these includes refusing to defend America ’s NATO allies , returning 11 million undocumented immigrants to their 11 million undocumented immigrants countries , saving $ 300 billion annually on a prescription drug program that spends only $ 78 billion a year , nationalizing concealed weapons permits and vowing that " If I become president , we ’re gon na be saying Merry Christmas at every store . .. You can leave Happy Holidays at the corner . " Should Democrats , I inquired , point to the infeasibility of Trump ’s proposals and the damaging results of any attempts on his Garin to follow through ? That approach would not work , Garin said , because voters , including many of Trump Trump , do n’t really " believe he will Garin a wall , or get Mexico to pay for a wall "   —    they have already discounted many of Trump ’s Trump assertions as hyperbole . " The real case has more to do with his character and temperament , " Garin said Garin " The biggest concern is that he is his unsuited to lead the country . " Celinda Lake , a Democratic pollster unaffiliated with the Clinton campaign , argued in an email that there were risks in attacking specific Trump proposals as unrealistic : In an interesting warning to Democrats , Arthur Lupia , a professor of political science at the University of Michigan , wrote me : Making a related argument , a Democratic strategist who sought anonymity in order to protect his relationship with the Clinton campaign , wrote me : This strategist cited the futility of accusing Trump of hyping crime : Democrats have to negotiate a tricky path in communicating their candidate Democrats " identification with the main concerns of many of Trump ’s Trump " on such issues as immigration , the strategist This strategist This empathy has to be Robert Borosage ,    of the Campaign for America ’s Future , a liberal advocacy group , described the problem of attempting to refute Trump    : Clinton ’s task , in Borosage ’s view , is not an easy one for a politician who has been in the national spotlight for more than a quarter of a century : " H. R. C. ’s challenge is to claim the future   —    one that is different than the past , " Borosage wrote . Borosage his speech in Philadelphia on Tuesday , Bill Clinton sought Clinton the issue Borosage raises of how Borosage Clinton can plausibly Clinton the future . " The former president referred to Clinton record of making " Clinton changes in people ’s lives " and noted that his wife is a " woman who his wife’s been satisfied with the status quo in anything . " Borosage brought up a second point , Borosage Hillary Clinton , who has campaigned on the theme that she will protect and enhance the Obama Borosage , needs to jump an additional hurdle : " Her biggest challenge is to be different Borosage Obama   —    bolder , challenging Wall Obama , corporate trade and tax deals . " Borosage ’s argument   —    that Borosage campaign is based on attitudes and ingrained belief systems , not on a set of policies   —    points to the difficulty of addressing Trump ’s    rhetoric . Douglas Massey , a professor of sociology at Princeton and the author of " Beyond Smoke and Mirrors : Mexican Immigration in an Age of Economic Integration " pointed out in an email , for example , that Similarly , The Wall Street Journal reported in July 2015 that numerous studies These facts are unlikely to dissuade voters convinced that immigrants are taking jobs , committing crimes and undermining American values . From their point of view , any crime by an illegal immigrant is one crime too many . There are many Democrats who believe that taking on Trump does not require nuance or calculation . " When 60 percent of voters say they ’ll never consider voting for you and you 60 percent of voters a 29 percent approval rating , you ’ve got a serious image problem , " Jim Jordan , who managed John Kerry ’s presidential campaign and served as executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , wrote me in an email . " Trump is already gushing blood . This is just Trump and tackling for the Clinton folks . " Jordan argues that " the two real imperatives " for Democrats are 1 ) " to deny Trump the ‘ I’    ’ space , " and 2 ) " to keep hammering on how bizarre and dangerous he is to America and our interests around the Jordan . His weird    on Putin and his invitation this Jordan to Russia to invade the Putin seem like good places to start . " Despite Jordan ’s confidence in Democratic presidential prospects , at the moment Trump has moved ahead of Clinton by 1 . 1 percent in the RealClearPolitics aggregation of recent polling . Jonathan Haidt , a social psychologist at N. Y. Haidt adopt a more subtle strategy in dealing with Trump . This , Haidt argues , is because Trump The elephant " really runs the show , " Haidt said , Translating this analytic approach to the 2016 election , in Haidt ’s view , means Haidt To counter Trump , Democrats have to get into the electorate Trump Haidt intuitive and unconscious level of responding to events before attempting a critique based on reasoned argument , according to Haidt . To do this , he wrote , the goal should be to portray Trump in ways that Haidt with " deep moral Trump Haidt fairness versus cheating and exploitation . " And how do you do that ? The next step is to present a vision of Trump that violates " moral intuitions about loyalty , Trump , and sanctity : " On Monday night in her speech , Michelle Obama tapped into this theme when she described " the kind of president that I The first lady for my girls and all our children . " Michelle Obama first lady declared : Haidt put it another way : I could not have said it better myself . Despite the overt chaos , the competing narratives of the fall campaign   —    it side The first lady attempt to define the other as weak or crazy and itself as tough and dependable   —    are clearly emerging from the conventions . The question is whether each side Democratic Party can get emotional enough or reach deep enough into our brains to counter the sheer i d of Trump ’s primeval appeal .
