This article contends that Donald Trump is a Conservative , but that he Donald Trump with a " New Language of Conservatism . "   He Donald Trump from the typical Conservative in the presentation of his Donald Trump , overarching philosophy , and policies .   It is this rhetoric and change in presentation that may be one of the reasons for his Donald Trump .   The " Standard Language of Conservatism " is to mention Conservative principles in speeches , policy positions , and debates .   This The "Standard Language of Conservatism" been so prevalent that it has The "Standard Language of Conservatism" a " Standard Test for Conservatism . "   In this Standard Test , if one mentioned Conservative principles in speeches , policy positions , and debates , the person was automatically a Conservative , and , if one did not mention them ,    was not .   Determining one ’s Conservatism by measuring the use of buzzwords in speeches , however , is a flawed test .   It focuses too much on one ’s rhetoric rather than one ’s actions .   The Standard Test ’s limitations is one of the reasons why politicians who do not vote based on Conservative principles ( such as voting for debt increases ) are still considered Conservative . The better approach , the New Test for Conservatism , would be to determine if one ’s policy positions and voting records lead to Conservative outcomes .   To use this test The Standard Test must first have a clear definition of Conservatism .   Some of its basic principles are : Using the Standard Test of Conservatism , it is easy to understand why some do not consider Mr. Trump to be a Conservative .   His speeches and Mr. Trump do not normally use Conservative buzzwords or themes .   It is premature , however , to not consider Mr. Trump a a Conservative choice of words in his speeches a Conservative policy papers disqualify him a Conservative the Standard Test , it a Conservative more appropriate to use the New Test to determine if Mr. Trump is a Mr. Trump   The table below lists Mr. Trump ’s positions and Mr. Trump which each would fulfill . ·          Jobs and economic opportunity , ·          Free market capitalism , ·          Free market capitalism , ·          Smaller national debt , ·          Balanced budget , ·          Small and limited federal government , ·          Federalism , ·          Balanced budget , ·          Smaller national debt , ·          Small and limited federal government , ·          Safety net , It is clear from the above table that Mr. Trump ’s positions would lead to Mr. Trump .   Via the New Test of Conservatism , therefore , Mr. Trump is a Conservative .   He Mr. Trump his Conservative objectives via a different Mr. Trump than other Mr. Trump , and this formula is his " New Language of Conservatism . "   a different formula than other politicians structuring his campaign around Conservative objectives , Mr. Trump structures Mr. Trump campaign around the goal to Mr. Trump America Great Mr. Trump ! " and his campaign that lead to this goal .   His speeches are very   .   He focuses on Mr. Trump the goal provides policy solutions to Mr. Trump .   For example , he discusses the problems of illegal immigration and America ’s His speeches deficits with foreign countries , and , to fix these problems , he America , respectively , a wall on the southern Mr. Trump and a renegotiation of America ’s trade agreements .   Trump approaches governing by focusing on problems and providing solutions America Conservatism rather than applying Conservative objectives and hoping that they will fix the problems .   While Trump does not mention Conservative principles , they are Conservative objectives implied and apparent if one analyzes the Trump of his proposed policies . Conservatives Trump does not mention Conservative principles speak via the Standard Language of Conservatism ( " Standard Language Trump " ) offer a different way of solving America ’s problems .   First , they argue for the implementation of Conservative objectives .   Second , they offer policy positions which Conservatives who speak via the Standard Language of Conservatism ("Standard Language Conservatives") to Conservative objectives .   For example , they may call Conservatives who speak via the Standard Language of Conservatism ("Standard Language Conservatives") the elimination of federal agencies to shrink the size of the federal government Conservatives who speak via the Standard Language of Conservatism ("Standard Language Conservatives")   They rarely state their goal is to improve America , but they leave this objective implied ( Conservatives who speak via the Standard Language of Conservatism ("Standard Language Conservatives") it should Conservatives who speak via the Standard Language of Conservatism ("Standard Language Conservatives") obvious but may not America’s to everyone Conservatives who speak via the Standard Language of Conservatism ("Standard Language Conservatives") .    The difference between Mr. Trump and the Standard Language Conservative is below : Make America Great Again , Mr. Trump Mr. Trump the cause of one America’s his greatest accomplishments , the influx of new voters into the Republican Party ( as of the end of April , Republican voting Mr. Trump the primary was up 60 % over 8 , 000 , 000 votes , compared to 2012 ) . He is likely bringing in these independents and former Democrats because they agree with his overarching goal , the problems he has identified Mr. Trump his solutions , and the Conservative objectives which are implied these independents and former Democrats   These Mr. Trump may not have previously supported Mr. Trump because they were Mr. Trump moved by the Standard Language .   They may not have liked the focus on Conservative objectives ( such as These individuals government ) as a solution to the nation ’s These individuals .   It is also possible the implied goal of improving America was not clear .   These independents and former Democrats , however , are moved by the New Language of Conservatism , share in the goal to " Make America Great Again ! " and want Mr. Trump to implement his policies ( and their implied Conservative objectives ) . With his America Language of Conservatism , Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee Mr. Trump and he garnered These independents and former Democrats most primary votes in the history Mr. Trump the Republican primary . In Mr. Trump , Conservative candidates should consider using this Mr. Trump Language of Conservatism in their elections because it may be the message which leads them to victory .
