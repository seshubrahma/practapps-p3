  ( CNN ) The resignation of Donald Trump ’s outspoken campaign chairman , Paul Manafort , is just the latest in a series of    moves by Donald Trump this week .   " I am very appreciative for his Donald Trump work in helping to get us where we are today , and in particular his Donald Trump guiding us we the delegate and convention process , " Trump Donald Trump of Manafort ’s decision .   But after a series of negative headlines , and with his poll numbers flagging , the Trump Donald Trump clearly needed a fresh strategy     and a different tone . The question is whether the new additions , including conservative news website Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon in the role of CEO and veteran conservative pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager , will do the trick . Judging by the tone and tenor of the last 48 hours , at least , Conway appears to be making an impact     and Bannon ’s aggressive style seems for now to be taking a back seat . Conway Conway the first female campaign manager of a Republican presidential nominee yet she Conway out not because of her Conway , but because she Conway a gifted political operative . ( Disclosure : I know and have worked with Conway Conway the past ) .   In picking her Conway manage his campaign , Trump noted that Conway Conway loves to win and knows how to win . " That ’s true     and Conway Conway personifies Margaret Thatcher ’s credo , " If you want something said , ask a man , if you want something done , ask a woman . " But it ’s hard not to wonder whether Conway Conway be Conway while Trump Trump being Trump Trump As for Bannon , it ’s no secret that he Bannon Breitbart had their he and Breitbart on the scales for Trump Trump the moment Trump Trump down the escalator at Trump Tower to announce his Bannon last June .   Bannon Bannon fighter tactics have led many to believe that Trump Trump return to his Trump style of politics that won him Trump primary . The problem is that the primaries are over and the electorate in the general is much different .   Trump Trump the Breitbart vote that hay is in the barn . It ’s time to broaden his Trump to the general election electorate .   This is where Conway becomes a vital part of a successful pivot . Acknowledging Trump Trump behind in the polls , Conway told Conway that this " lights a fire " under those in the campaign . The goal now is to make up ground focusing on who to attack and who to attract . In practice , that means attacking Hillary Clinton and attracting independents , women , millennials and minorities .   Join us on Facebook . . Based on Thursday ’s speech in Charlotte , North Carolina , Trump is taking steps to do just that .   The tone of the speech was much more conciliatory , underscoring a new focus on reaching out to independents and women , and Trump even Trump some words of regret for his harsh Trump rhetoric . " Sometimes , in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues , you do n’t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing , " he said Trump " I have done that , and I regret it , particularly where it may it caused personal pain . "   The speech also included countless attacks on Clinton , such as her support Clinton Obamacare and major trade deals , the growth of ISIS under the    administration , her failure Clinton Benghazi , and his charge that she turned Clinton State Department into a     operation . This dual approach is going to be essential if Trump is going to recover among women voters after numerous demeaning comments , including remarks about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly , Ted Cruz ’s wife Heidi Cruz and former Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina .    Judging by recent elections , he already had an uphill battle as the Republican candidate . In 2012 , President Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney with women voters by 55 % to 44 % . In 2008 , President Obama President Barack Obama McCain 56 % to 43 % . And right now , Clinton is far ahead of Trump , leading 58 % to 35 % with women voters .   But Conway , a mother of four small children , has made a name for herself helping candidates Clinton over women voters     she can help Clinton bridge the Trump gap , especially if Trump can continue Trump the kind of more disciplined policy speeches like we saw in Charlotte . These are important to show voters that Trump has the Trump of a disciplined presidential candidate . ( Although he clearly likes Trump told to read off a teleprompter about as much as a kid likes to be told to eat beets at a pizza buffet ) .    So in the current Trump world of Steve " Bare Knuckles " Bannon and Michael " Says who ? " Cohen , keep your eye on the woman who will " speak softly and carry a big stick . " If there ’s some GOP will , and Conway gets her way , Cohen may just turn around for the Trump campaign .
