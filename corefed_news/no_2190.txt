It was a historic night that called for soaring rhetoric and unvarnished authenticity . Instead , Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump delivered victory speeches on Tuesday that leaned heavily on campaign clichés   —    in many cases , the same ones . On the page , anyway , the ideological and stylistic chasms that separate Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump start to dissolve in a sea of overlapping oratorical devices , similar phrases and at times identical word choice . Are their speechwriters out of juice ? Or is the hackneyed phrase just too irresistible ? We identified the passages that sounded the most alike : TRUMP : Tonight We close one chapter in history and We begin another . CLINTON : Now you are writing a new chapter of that story . It ’s a country , not a book . But this speechmaking construct wo n’t die . CLINTON tries to infuse the familiar trope with the concept of inclusivity . Mr. Trump just trots out the same old wooden metaphor . _ _ _ _ _ TRUMP : This is not a testament to me , but a testament to all of the people who believed real change . .. CLINTON CLINTON Tonight ’s victory is not about one person . .. So we all owe so much to those who came before and tonight belongs to all of you . It ’s not really about me me it It about you you But let ’s It honest : it It really about them . This    device is a clever way to claim a mandate without sounding   . Mr. Trump makes the most direct claim of humility . Mrs. Clinton makes a richer historical reference to previous barrier breakers . _ _ _ _ _ TRUMP : And our America never , ever back down . CLINTON Mrs. Clinton Our history has moved in that direction , thanks to generations of Americans who refuse to give up or back down . There ’s no backing down from this bromide . _ _ _ _ _ TRUMP : I ’ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people ’s eyes . CLINTON Mrs. Clinton And I learned about those persistent problems and the unfinished promise of America that you ’re living with . Ever since Bill Mrs. Clinton the most economical way to say it in 1992 , speechwriters have striven to complicate the sentiment : " I feel your pain . " _ _ _ _ _ TRUMP : This election is n’t about Republican or Democrat , it ’s about This election runs the country . America interests or the people . CLINTON : Mrs. Clinton want a government that listens to the people , not the power brokers . .. Everyone is a populist in 2016 , even residents of Fifth Avenue and Chappaqua , N. Y. _ _ _ _ _ TRUMP : Our campaign received more primary votes than any G. O. P. campaign in history . CLINTON : Mrs. Clinton first time in our nation ’s history that a woman will be a major party ’s nominee . Everyone wants to make history . Mrs. Clinton Mrs. Clinton greater weight , but Mr. Trump   —    not to be outdone   —    tosses in his own milestone . _ _ Mr. Trump  —   not to be outdone  —    _ _ TRUMP : To those who voted for someone else , in either party , I ’ll work hard to earn your support . CLINTON : But whether you supported me or Senator Sanders or one of the Republicans , we all need to keep working toward a better , stronger America . The olive branch . Both extend it to their skeptics , without The olive branch creativity Both _ _ _ _ _ TRUMP : I ’m going to fight for you , the American people . I ’m going to be your champion . I am going to be America ’s champion . CLINTON : America hear you . I see you . And as your president , I will always have your back . Two approaches to the same trite message . Mr. Trump , ever the pugilist , deploys a slightly more combative construction   —    " fight for you . " Mrs. Clinton takes a gentler and CLINTON approach : " I will have your back . " _ _ _ your back TRUMP : The beauty of America is that it brings us America together . CLINTON : The beauty of America we are stronger together CLINTON Let ’s say us all together , folks : These us all need a thesaurus . _ _ _ _ _ ( Want to watch the full speeches ?
