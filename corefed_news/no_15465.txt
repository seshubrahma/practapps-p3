" Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told senators Thursday , " I strongly believe that the whole Russia investigation is adequately resourced . " One source said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is n’t inclined to make a change unless the FBI the whole Russia investigation be imperiled , and at this point , FBI officials are confident that the investigation is moving the whole Russia investigation despite Comey ’s abrupt firing .
