House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) refused Sunday to condemn a sexist joke by a Democratic House colleague about Kellyanne Conway , President Donald Trump ’s campaign manager and White House counselor . [ House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , appearing on CNN ’s State of the Union with Jake Tapper , cited the Access Hollywood video that emerged during the presidential campaign last October as a reason for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi refusal . That video , filmed in 2005 , recorded President Donald Trump’s making crude comments about women in a hot mic ,    conversation with host Billy Bush .   Rep. Cedric Richmond ( ) had joked that Conway looked " familiar in that position " when a photograph emerged of Rep. Cedric Richmond ( ) on Rep. Cedric Richmond ( ) knees on a couch in the Oval Office . Tapper asked Pelosi to respond : Tapper : I need to ask about this crew joke that was told this week a by a member of your caucus , a Democratic congressman , Cedric Richmond at the Washington Press Club foundation annual dinner , at the expense of White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway . Take a listen . Richmond ( on tape ) : And you can just explain to me that , that circumstance , because she really looked kind of familiar in that position there . Tapper : Leader Pelosi , the joke was sexist , the joke was disgusting . Should n’t the congressman apologize to White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway ? And , honestly , where is the Democratic Party in expressing outrage about this ? Pelosi : I was n’t at the dinner . I ’m just finding out about this this The fact is , I ’m ’m in sort of a state of " What is going on here ? " that the person who occupies the White House is a person who was on that Hollywood video , that said the crude things he the person who occupies the White House about women . You all are criticizing Cedric for something he the person who occupies the White House in the course of the evening   —    and he the person who occupies the White House should be criticized for that , I just do n’t know the particulars . But I do , every day , marvel at the fact that somebody who said the gross and crude things that President Trump said   —    he President Trump n’t even be allowed in a the White House and he President Trump in the White House . Tapper : Well , I think we ’ve been covered the Access Hollywood tape quite a bit , but I guess the question is : if one criticizes only Republicans when they make crude only Republicans , does that not undermine the moral authority if they do n’t only Republicans when Democrats make crude comments ? Pelosi : Well , I think everybody was making crude comments , and I just do n’t know , I was n’t at that dinner . But I was at the dinner last that dinner the Gridiron Club , and we were all , I think , quite , shall we say , respectable we I ’ll look at what my colleague said there , but I do think that in the Oval Office we were always , we with decorum appropriate for the White House . Richmond ’s joke caused such outrage that even Chelsea Clinton defended Kellyanne Conway , but Pelosi evidently will not . Joel B. Pollak is Senior     at Breitbart News . He was named one Joel B.
