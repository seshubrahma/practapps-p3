Sunday on CBS ’s " Face the Nation , " Democratic presidential    Hillary Clinton suggested Republican presidential    Donald Trump had other motives when Republican presidential   Donald Trump was raising the issue of Monica Lewinsky , the former White House intern with which President Bill Clinton admitted to having an " inappropriate relationship . "   Partial transcript as follows : DICKERSON : All right , Senator , let me ask you about a general election opponent you may face . That is Republican presidential   Donald Trump . You got into a pretty ugly exchange . You charged that he Republican presidential   Donald Trump —    you charged him Republican presidential   Donald Trump sexism , and then he Republican presidential   Donald Trump out an Instagram video of your husband and Monica Lewinsky . Your reaction to that ? CLINTON : Well , if he Republican presidential   Donald Trump to engage in personal attacks from the past , that ’s his Republican presidential   Donald Trump . You know , so be it . I ’m going to draw the distinctions between where I stand and where he Republican presidential   Donald Trump when it comes to equal pay for women , raising the minimum wage , which affects    of the women , who are the ones receiving the minimum wage , protecting a woman ’s right to make the most personal health care decisions . That ’s why I ’m so proud to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I received today in New Hampshire , because I ’m ’m to fight as hard as I can against any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood , something that he supports . So , there are very clear distinctions . He he say whatever he he to about me he Let the voters judge that . But I am not going to let him he any of the other Republicans rip away the progress that women have made . It ’s been too    . And I ’m going to stand up and make it clear there ’s a huge difference between us . DICKERSON : Secretary Clinton , what do you say , though , to those even in your own party who say that   —    a discussion of that portion of your husband ’s career is fair game to talk about in an election ? CLINTON Secretary Clinton Well , it ’s been fair game going back to the Republicans for some years . They the Republicans do it it if they the Republicans to . That can be their the Republicans as to how to run in this campaign . Did n’t work before . It wo n’t work again , because it It what people are focused on , not for the past , but for the future . What are we going to do to get wages rising ? What are we we to do to create more good jobs ? What are we we to do keep rights ? What are we we to do to make sure that the Supreme Court has people on it the Supreme Court will defend women ’s rights , who will defend marriage equality , who will defend voter rights ? So , I ca n’t run anybody else ’s campaign . They can say whatever they They . More power to them They I think it ’s a dead end , blind alley for them , but let them them . I ’m going to talk about the differences between us , because I think that ’s what Americans care about . Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
