On Friday ’s broadcast of " PBS NewsHour , " New York Times columnist David Brooks praised the Syria strike by saying " the Syria strike was incumbent upon the US to do something when chemical weapons were used . " And " there is some upside to having somebody who ’s a little unpredictable . "   David Brooks said , " The question what ’s next strikes me as a secondary question . The primary question is , what are we going to do about chemical warfare ? A hundred years ago , right now , World War I was going on , and there were people were being gassed in the trenches . And the fact that the world community has basically tried to eliminate chemical weapons since that time strikes me as a great achievement . And to go back on that would be a great step backward for civilization . And Barack Obama , unfortunately , did n’t do anything when chemical weapons were used . So , I think it was incumbent upon the US to do something when chemical weapons were used . " He continued , " Does this signal some grand change of strategy in the Middle East ? I sort of doubt this . But at least we set this precedent on this particular issue . Now , the question   —    I think it was probably totally impulsive of President Trump to do this . President Trump ’s an impulsive person , and we ’re stuck the downsides of President Trump impulsivity . But there are upsides to having an impulsive president because nobody in the world , and especially in places like North Korea , quite knows what ’s going to happen . And so , frankly , there are some advantages to that . " Brooks later added , " I would rather have a strategy , obviously . But I ’m just pointing out there is some upside to having somebody who ’s a little unpredictable .    …      I suspect it was a    case   …     but I think it was the right    thing to do .
