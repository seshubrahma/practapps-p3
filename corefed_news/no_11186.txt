WASHINGTON , D. C.   —      Donald J. Trump ’s inauguration will have less official celebration throughout the day and evening so he can focus on getting right to work on behalf of the American people , officials involved in the planning process tell Breitbart News . inauguration will be less focused on the donor class and ritzy Washington insiders as in years past and more focused on the regular working class people across the country for whom Trump has become the champion . [ " The inauguration and inaugural is a representation of the    and a representation of the vice " Boris Epshteyn , the director of communications for the Presidential Inaugural Committee ( PIC ) told Breitbart News in an exclusive     tour of the PIC ’s offices in Washington , D. C. on Thursday .    " What does that mean ? It ’s all about the people , " Epshteyn said . " It ’s It about any one celebrity or any one entertainer or about any of those folks sipping champagne and cocktails somewhere in the Hamptons or in Beverly Hills . It ’s It the American people . We ’re so proud of the amount of support and outreach we ’ve We from all over the country . This inaugural will represent the people the American people ’s one , and two it ’s about getting to work right away . " So , logistically , what does this all mean ? Specifically , Epshteyn says , Trump will only have three official inaugural balls as compared with 10 separate balls for Barack Obama ’s 2009 inauguration . " There will three balls instead of 10 , as there were in 2009 with President Obama because Barack Obama —   Donald J. Trump —   is all about getting to work and making sure Americans are safe in their homes , safe Americans their jobs , " Americans said . " Look at the news that just came out this week : 8 , 000 jobs being brought to America between Sprint and OneWeb . " Alex Stroman , the deputy director of communications for the PIC , explained that President Trump will also continue the official     Inaugural Ball —   a tradition started by George W. Bush and continued by Obama —   and expand that . Previously , that ball had just enlisted members of the U. S. military in attendance . Trump is going to President Trump that ball to include that ball like police , firefighters and EMTs —   and will also allow in veterans , military families and wounded warriors . Stroman said : Usually a president will come in President Obama ’ll have 10 official military families and wounded warriors in addition to the unofficial balls that happen . President Obama had 10 in 2009 , President Bush in 2001 and 2005 I believe had nine balls each in addition to the unofficial balls that took place . This president is going to attend President Obama . We only have three official balls . We have two that are like the We balls , and then we three balls —   it ’s a We President Bush started in 2005 with the     ball , President Obama continued it and President Trump President Obama continuing it but expanding it . This ball , the general it ca n’t it a ticket . Historically , it ’s only been active duty members of the military it   specifically enlisted members . This year , we ’ve expanded it to include military families , wounded warriors , veterans This year and first responders as well . So you ’ll have police , firemen , who will all be there . It ’ll be a thank you for them for their service to our country . Stroman explained police, firemen, who will all be there the police, firemen, who will all be there focus is because Trump has an enormous amount of respect for all those who put their lives on the line to protect the country . all those who put their lives on the line to protect the country went on : I think you our country that [ Stroman ’s respect for the military , police , veterans and Trump responders ] throughout the   ’s campaign . Some of my favorite photos are when you see every time he made a stop at his airplane , he ’d stop Stroman take photos with the Stroman who were Stroman him . This is a president , he ’s vowed to Stroman a law and order president . Stroman respects our police , he respects our military , he Stroman those who put their Stroman on our line whether Stroman ’s firemen or EMTs those who put their lives on the line whether it’s firemen or EMTs or police every day police every day . He made that a point throughout his campaign to honor these Stroman , veterans , military , Stroman cetera , who put their lives on the line for our country . It ’s these folks, veterans way to , in one of his first acts as president , to thank those who do Stroman . Another change from previous inaugurations , Stroman said , is that the parade from the Capitol to the White House on Inauguration Day is expected to be shortened to just an hour or so . That will allow Trump to get right to work at the White House on day one , before he goes to the White House that night . Stroman told Breitbart : Trump ’re going to have a parade Stroman is going to be shortened . I think Eisenhower ’s parade was something like six hours long . You ’ve had previous parades that are three or four hours long . This is going to be a shorter parade , an hour to hour and a half or so so he can go to work . That ’s what the American people elected Trump to do : To go on with the traditions , he ’s Trump to have a church service , but he ’s not Trump to sit there for hours and then have this Trump —   and of course for the people who come to Washington to watch the parade , he ’s going to have a shortened parade and he this parade to Trump into the White House and get some work Trump before he goes to the balls . Again , the thinking , Stroman stressed Trump is that Trump wants to honor tradition while also wasting no time helping protect Americans’ safety and jobs . He said : The    is about honoring the traditions , and this Trump a ceremony about the American people more than any one person . You ’ve seen some previous inaugurations are really lavish , you have a lot of long events , a lot of big events . This    is somebody who ’s ready to get to work . So if you look at the Carrier deal , look at Sprint today , look at the Boeing and Lockheed Martin stuff . He ’s already —   and this is impressive with our leadership , at least in modern times , in that there ’s a transition and    who is already getting to work before he even takes office . You ’re going to see that reflected in the He itself . Epshteyn added that while Trump ’s inauguration is a " celebration , " the focus is going to the inauguration itself getting to work on behalf of the American people . He said : This is a celebration . It is a celebration of freedom of democracy Epshteyn There will two inaugural balls and one This saluting armed services and first responders , which is so important . The first responders are a new addition too . This is the Commander in Chief ball , and we ’re honoring first responders because those are the people who are the firefighters and in the ambulances , and the police of course —   the police who keep us safe —   this is to honor them . These exclusive interviews with Epshteyn and we came as PIC staff , including press those are the people who are the firefighters and in the ambulances Ali Pardo , provided Breitbart News with an exclusive tour of the PIC offices Pardo Administration ( GSA ) building near L’Enfant Plaza in Washington , D. C. The sprawling offices represent the beachhead of Trump ’s looming takeover of the federal government , a culture very different from business as usual in government offices in Washington , D. C.         The halls of the GSA building ’s PIC corridors are decorated with Trump trophies Washington including a series of photo spreads of his rallies . A white board in one of the government offices has # MAGA —   the Twitter hashtag for the " Make America Great Again " campaign slogan —   scribbled on it , while the official inaugural seal of the incoming president and vice president is on each of the doors . Make America Great hats line desks inside the communications office , as well .       In addition to the Trump America spreads showing thousands of his supporters , the hallway is adorned with a giant ceramic    elephant —   complete with red legs and Trump stars inside its blue body .     Stroman notes that the building and the space technically are not Stroman by taxpayers , a giant ceramic   elephant for minimal building costs from the GSA . He said : The entire building is two city blocks long Stroman each side . We GSA a GSA building , a the GSA building and the GSA for the last couple inaugurals by statute have given PIC GSA to the building GSA office space to support . They do the same thing for the transition . It ’s a fairly new thing . They come in and they allow us to operate inside the government building , but we ’re a 501 ( c)4 so we They a not for They . We ’s not the GSA building . Very few taxpayer dollars We expended except for allowing us to We in a building and turning on a 501( c)4 lights and giving us temporary office furniture that ’s pretty low key . Since the PIC is a the PIC with putting together Inauguration Day and week , it us —   without the PIC , Stroman says , since the    wants no lobbyists involved —   Stroman pay for the events . He went on to explain : We fundraise , we ’ve capped Stroman at a million dollars . No funds from lobbyists , but we do take individual and corporation dollars —   but the We point about that and the reason why that ’s so important is because the underwriters are the ones who allow the general public to come and attend these and make sure we are n’t using taxpayer dollars for the ceremony . It ’s a group of folks who underwrite the expenses of the inaugural committee and the we and the stands and the security and the fencing and renting the ballrooms this parade people allow it so we can keep prices free or cheap . I would n’t say that ’s unique to ours but people kind of think the inauguration itself It kind of exclusive . But the inauguration is for the people and that ’s the inauguration itself especially has we the charge to this President Obama the inauguration itself . The tickets along the parade route , the majority of the parade route is open to the public . We ’ll do a welcome concert The Presidential Inaugural Committee’s evening and while there will be ticketed guests the majority of those tickets will be the parade route then in addition to the free tickets , you just have to request a ticket , there will be places for the public to watch if they ’re just driving up to Washington . If you ’re driving up , people can come to Washington and celebrate this historic Washington , celebrate this president and do it with minimal cost the public to watch Washington President Obama the role of the PIC is the inauguration itself have a Stroman Inauguration Day so that President Trump ’s first 100 days can get off the starting block without Inauguration Day   and he can get rolling into setting up the government . The PIC deputy director said President Trump The the PIC Inaugural Committee ’s role is to plan any event outside of the actual swearing in ceremony . It ’s to the federal government balls , the parade , any kind of private events , family events , and then also does have a hand in the swearing in ceremony itself the ceremony ’s and the vice   ’s interests in The Presidential Inaugural Committee’s role ceremony itself as well , but also everything surrounding the inauguration . It ’s interesting because our charge from the    is to help set up that kickoff point to that first The Presidential Inaugural Committee’s role days . You have the inauguration itself that takes place immediately after and ceremony itself itself with the selection of cabinet appointees and kind of The Presidential Inaugural Committee’s role the initial messaging . Then you have us , whose job is to be that first picture from the second he raises his hand to take the oath of office through the rest of that day and that weekend . So they all kind of three work together . You have the presidential transition , the inaugural committee , and that first 100 days aspect of the administration whose job I whose job it ’s our job to tie those three areas together , the transition and the kickoff of the first 100 days which is what the inauguration is . Expectations , he added , are that about a half a million people —   maybe more —   might make their way to Washington the inauguration itself the historic event in person . Stroman went on : We have n’t put out any official numbers Washington our end here Stroman PIC , but planners outside of the PIC are saying probably a half the PIC million or so . But I think about a half a million people enthusiasm whether it ’s folks who make their way to D. C. or folks watching our around the world , I think it ’s our to be the biggest event ever . If you look at his rallies where he tens of thousands —   hundreds of thousands —   of people at rallies all across the enthusiasm country , the amount of interest you ’ve seen around the world in the first our country be    his rallies government service ever elected . So the interest all around the country his around the world is high . Pardo noted , too , that the PIC our country team is the PIC the PIC that the hundreds of millions of Americans who the world be able to make it to Washington for the inauguration festivities —   and the billions worldwide —   can get a front row the world the action using media tools Washington " We ’re also making sure we ’re providing that for people who are n’t here , through technology —   we ’re being innovating , " Pardo said . " We ’re trying to make sure everybody across the country has a seat to this historic day . Anyone can access it whether it ’s on social media our country it on We news Pardo but we want to make sure everyone has the ability to watch We historic event across the country and around the world We " 
 our country the world We it it
