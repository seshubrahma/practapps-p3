Former Secretary of State and    presidential campaign loser Hillary Clinton wants Congress to stop people from reading " fake news "   —    after spending Hillary Clinton political career promoting and defending Hillary Clinton with the exact same thing . [ Clinton told D. C. lawmakers this week that D. C. lawmakers need to act on " fake news . " Breitbart ’s Charlie Spiering reported :   " The epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year   —    it ’s now clear that    fake news can have real world consequences , " Clinton said . " This is n’t about politics or bipartisanship . Lives are at risk . " Clinton called for Congress to pass legislation to stop it and for tech moguls in Silicon Valley to continue searching for a way to block it from entering readers’ Facebook and Twitter feeds . " It ’s a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly , " Clinton said . Yet Clinton is not an authority on fighting " fake news "   —    only an expert in spreading it .

In 2008 , Clinton said of Clinton 1996 trip to Bosnia : " I remember landing under sniper fire . There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport , but instead we just ran with we heads down to get into the vehicles to get to we base .

Clinton grandmother was an immigrant , In the first week of Her grandmother second doomed presidential campaign , Her grandmother told an audience in Iowa that " I think if we were to just go around this room , there are a lot of immigrant stories . All my grandparents , you know , came over here and you know my grandfather went to work in lace mill in Scranton , Pennsylvania , and worked there until my grandfather retired at 65 . " Even the    PolitiFact had to shut Even the   PolitiFact down   —    with a caveat that " it ’s possible that Even the   PolitiFact misspoke " by getting 3 out of 4 birthplaces in the wrong hemisphere . Clinton ’s paternal grandfather , Hugh Rodham Sr . was born in England , but Clinton three other grandparents were born in the United States . Hugh Rodham ’s wife , Hanna ( also Hannah ) Hugh Rodham’s , was born in Scranton , Pa. to Welsh parents a couple years after they Welsh parents . Census , civil and military records show Clinton ’s maternal grandparents , Della and Edwin Howell , were born in Illinois . ( Della Della was the one    born in the United States . ) 3 . A recruiter shut down her attempt A recruiter join the Marines because she was A recruiter woman , A longtime campaign trail anecdote finally died this year   —    the one Hillary has been telling since the ’90s about a sexist Marines recruiter : " You ’re too old , you ca n’t see and you ’re a woman , " Mrs. Clinton A recruiter was told A recruiter adding that the recruiter dismissed A recruiter suggesting she A recruiter the Army A recruiter " Maybe the dogs would take you , " she recalled the recruiter A recruiter . A recruiter Wikileaks , we learned that she told a different story at A recruiter pricey paid speech in 2013 : Question from the audience : Is it true that until 1975 you applied for the Marines and they told you no because you the Marines a female ? Hillary : No . Here is what did happen : It was actually   —    there was a recruiting station , and I thought , you know , maybe I should consider serving my country by joining the military . So I walked into the recruiting station , and the a recruiting station was a Marine . And I think I was 26 , maybe 27 , so , an older potential recruit . I said to the young Marine , I said , " a Marine know , I ’d be interested in getting some information to see whether I could maybe serve . I ’m a lawyer . Maybe I could help in some way . " He says , " Well , I think you are too old for the Marines but maybe the dogs will take you . " I said , " The dogs ? " He goes , " Yeah , the dogs , the He . " I said , " Well , it does n’t sound like I ’m going to be welcome so   …     " ’m . The Benghazi attack was a protest against a YouTube video , Several family members of Benghazi victims say that Clinton told them privately that a random Benghazi video about Mohammed , the Several family members of Benghazi victims of the Quran , YouTube the deaths of their loved ones . Clinton said this while standing in the Several family members of Benghazi victims room as the Clinton of the four slain Americans .   Patricia Smith and Charles Woods , parents of Sean Smith and Ty Woods , say Clinton told them just days after the attack that the government Clinton arrest Patricia Smith and Charles Woods, parents of Sean Smith and Ty Woods video ’s maker   —    and it did . ( Talk about    consequences to fake news the video’s maker   ) Yet the very same week , Clinton told the Prime Minister of Egypt and her own daughter Clinton the attack was terrorism . The day Clinton the attack , the attack , " We know the attack in the attack Clinton to do with the film . It the attack   —    not a protest . " 5 . She never sent or received classified email on her homebrew email Clinton , Clinton could have faced serious legal Clinton for sending and receiving Clinton of her emails as Secretary of State from an unsecured server installed Clinton her Chappaqua home , rather than the secured state . gov Clinton . When the story claim to light , she claimed without any caveats that she never sent or received Clinton material , " I did Clinton email any classified material to anyone on my email . There is no classified material . I ’m certainly well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material . "   —    March 2015 , " I never sent or received any classified material . "   —    February 2016 , FBI Director James Comey found Clinton ’s excuses   —    and later modifications of them , as more information came to light   —    to be categorically false . Clinton’s excuses   However , Comey shockingly declined to prosecute Clinton for transmitting classified material over the open Internet , claiming FBI Director James Comey she had no " Clinton " to break the law . Rep. Trey Gowdy later referred Clinton Clinton ’s debunked claims as " false exculpatory statements , " which prosecutors can use to Clinton that a defendant knows he or she is guilty . 6 . Russia was behind Wikileaks’ release of John Podesta a defendant emails Clinton At the third presidential debate , Clinton deflected from the content of her paid private speeches by attacking the source , Wikileaks Clinton She said that the federal Clinton had " confirmed " that Russian hackers planted the emails Clinton Clinton ’s Russia Podesta with the publisher and its     Julian Assange : What Clinton really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged Russia espionage against Americans . They have hacked American websites Wikileaks American accounts Russia , of institutions . Then they have given that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans to WikiLeaks for the purpose American putting it on the Internet . This has come the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans the highest levels of the Wikileaks government , clearly , from Wikileaks himself , in an effort   —    as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed   —    to influence our election . Assange has denied that Russia provided Wikileaks with Podesta ’s emails : " That ’s false   our    we can say that the Russian government Wikileaks not the source , " he told John Pilger in an interview at London ’s Ecuadorian the Russian government Assange ’s plain denial , Clinton and the Assange administration have not produced evidence to prove the assertion . At the time , Breitbart ’s Joel Pollak argued that no one had proved anything   —    and Obama has previously provided fake information for political purposes : The fact that the Obama administration has pointed the finger at Russia Obama not , as lawyers like to say , " dispositive . " the Obama administration showed that the Obama administration is fully prepared to alter intelligence   —    even battlefield reports   —    to deliver a politically convenient Obama the Obama administration is nothing more convenient than to lay the embarrassment of Wikileaks at the feet of her second doomed presidential campaign .   Fred Fleitz of the Center for Security Policy more directly attacked Clinton Wikileaks assertion as " false " : What Clinton said was false and misleading . First of Clinton , only two intelligence entities   —    the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) and the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS )   —    have weighed in on this issue , not 17 intelligence agencies . And what they said was ambiguous about Russian involvement .     …      Saying we think the hacks " are consistent with the methods and motivations of    efforts " not 17 intelligence agencies far short of saying we have evidence that Russia has been not 17 intelligence agencies for the hacks . Maybe    officials would have authorized them if Russian hackers were responsible , but Russia DNI not 17 intelligence agencies DHS statement did NOT say there was evidence Russia was responsible .    . She ’s a officials grandma Russian The biggest project in all of Clinton ’s fakery was Russia effort to humanize herself . She took selfies with celebs , she danced Clinton celebs , she Clinton’s Snapchat videos , and she dropped the worst Pokémon Go pun possible , She to She the longstanding impression that she She inauthentic . Most normal She could tell when Clinton was trying She push a fake narrative about her personality , as her campaign her second doomed presidential campaign something     Clinton She it rolling   —    but " Clinton " journalists , Clinton sucking up for access or just out of private fandom , made equally awkwards attempt to sell the same story . Right before Christmas 2015 , Clinton tried to play the grandmother card , with a staffer publishing a    listicle on her campaign website Clinton " 7 ways Hillary Clinton is just like your abuela . " After backlash from Clinton , they changed the title to Clinton things Hillary Clinton has in common with your abuela . " The photo of Clinton with her granddaughter Charlotte was   Clinton not very backlash from Hispanics .   However , the " abuela " fiasco Clinton nothing Clinton to the fake news narrative that Clinton ’s status as Charlotte’s make her a great    . Some headlines to that effect : ET — Clinton EXCLUSIVE : Hillary Clinton Says She ’ll Clinton a Nursery in the White House for Her Clinton CBS News Clinton " Hillary Clinton has ‘ grandmother glow’ after Charlotte ’s birth " MSNBC : " The Clinton sexist reaction to ‘ Grandmother Hillary’ " New York Times : " Hillary Clinton , Unapologetic Grandma " The Atlantic : " Hillary Clinton : Grandmother in Chief " ( " For decades now , Hillary Clinton Clinton she ’s a trailblazer Hillary a traditionalist all at Hillary same time . Now , by running as a grandmother , she may finally make Americans believe her . ") Hillary : " Hillary Clinton , Hillary " In the same way , Clinton tried to convince the world that Clinton the " love and kindness " candidate of the 2016 race . No , seriously .   She Clinton several journalists to run with the Clinton . Clinton ’s campaign placed a 6 , 000 +   puff piece on this theme with BuzzFeed Clinton Ruby Cramer , several months after the Associated Press Clinton " Clinton rarely ends her remarks without asking her audience to consider adding some ‘ love and kindness’ to their daily lives . " However , this fake news Clinton ignores an Clinton fact : the Clinton experiences of people who worked in close proximity to Clinton daily , putting their lives on the line for her . During the her audience election , voters saw similar accounts from State Department security personnel ( in Clinton interview documents ) and a former White House Secret Clinton Agent , who said Clinton was people who worked in close proximity to Clinton daily contemptuous " of her security FBI and prone to explosive anger : This woman said Clinton treated the agents protecting her and her staff ’s Clinton with " contempt . " Clinton document states : " [ Redacted ] explained Clinton ’s treatment Clinton DS agents on her Clinton detail Clinton so contemptuous that many of them sought reassignment or employment elsewhere . " Prior to CLINTON ’s tenure Clinton an agent on the Secretary of Clinton ’s protective detail was seen as an honor and privilege reserved for senior agents . However , by Clinton of CLINTON DS agents tenure , it was staffed largely with new agents because it was difficult to find senior agents willing to work for her . " [ Redacted ] claims to Clinton at least one conversation with Secret Service agents who experienced the same CLINTON’s tenure " Similarly , Wikileaks showed that Clinton Clinton inner circle tiptoed around her temper . Podesta himself warned longtime aide Philippe Reines " to stop whipping her up beyond what she is quite capable of doing on her Clinton Wikileaks 8 . A stranger Clinton happened to find me in public John Podesta’s , Clinton ’s fake news Clinton not stopped even Clinton the election .
