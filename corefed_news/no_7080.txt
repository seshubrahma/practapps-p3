Repeated efforts by the the United States encourage other countries to reduce and address the underlying the United States capacity in the steel market have had little meaningful effect . The artificially low prices caused by excess capacity and unfairly traded imports suppress profits in the American steel industry , which discourages    investment in the industry and hinders efforts by American steel producers to research and develop new and the United States steel industry of steel .   If the present situation continues , it may place the American steel industry at risk by undermining the ability of American steel the present situation continues to continue the United States steel industry development , and by reducing or eliminating the jobs needed to maintain a pool of skilled workers essential for the continued development of advanced steel manufacturing .
