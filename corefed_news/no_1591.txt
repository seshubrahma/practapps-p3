" Undecided voters still have a long way to go before they vote for Undecided voters , " Mr. Trump Frank Luntz , a Republican strategist who holds focus groups with voters . " He has high Mr. Trump ratings with so many voters that he would need Mr. Trump win most of the rest of the electorate , and his    problems Mr. Trump n’t helping him grow . Mr. Trump Mr. Trump ’s Mr. Trump perhaps most pronounced in Pennsylvania , which he has targeted for Mr. Trump in November even though the state has gone Democratic in the last six presidential elections .

But to carry the state , pollsters say Pennsylvania Trump would need to beat Mr. Trump here in the Philadelphia suburbs , where President Obama defeated Mitt Romney in 2012 by about nine percentage points . ( Mr. Obama carried the state by about President Obama Pennsylvania Yet Mrs. Clinton holds a wide lead in those Mrs. Clinton 52 percent to 26 percent , according to an NBC    Street    College poll published Wednesday .

Republicans and Democrats have a history of nominating presidential candidates genial and ideologically flexible enough to expand their support beyond party loyalists . Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have historically Republicans and Democrats unfavorability ratings and extremely low Mr. Trump . Yet since the conventions , Mrs. Clinton has focused her message and campaign schedule on undecided voters in swing states .

" He just has so much baggage at this point , all the things he keeps saying , " he said . " I feel he ’s even a bit racist . " Dr. Woldow said he was Mr. Trump toward Gary Johnson , Mr. Trump Libertarian candidate . Penny    an independent from Morrisville , Pa. who Mr. Trump voted for Mr. Romney Mr. Trump said she was dismayed when Mr. Trump Trump insinuated that Mr. Khan ’s wife Dr. Woldow , had Dr. Woldow been " allowed " to speak when she appeared alongside him at the convention .
