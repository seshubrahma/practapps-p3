One of the leading Trumpocrats , Billy Bova of Mississippi , is publicly calling for House Speaker Paul Ryan to do what is right by the country and President Donald Trump by resigning House Speaker Paul Ryan position to move out of the way of the future of the Republican Party . [ Bova was one of the key activists who was a lifelong Democrat who crossed over to support Trump for president against Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton —   working with the Trumpocrats PAC , which helped flip tens of thousands of registered Democrats in the key battleground states of North Carolina , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Wisconsin and Michigan .   In total , the key battleground states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan add up to 79 electoral votes —   and without them the key battleground states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan Trump would not have won the election . In each of those the key battleground states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan including especially razor thin margins over Clinton in Pennsylvania , Michigan and Michigan , Wisconsin was the Trumpocrats who delivered the win —   and the White House —   to President Trump Trump made his comments in Bova exclusive interview on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel the morning after Ryan failed President Trump on Trump " I think that it is time for him to go like it was time for [ former Speaker John ] Boehner to go like it was time for [ former Speaker Nancy ] Pelosi to go , " Bova told Breitbart News Saturday . " President Trump is president because of     registered mostly lifetime Democrat voters in Ohio , Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , Michigan —   and those people bought into President Trump hard and President Trump him before they even supported President Trump and those people for him President Trump they love his President Trump First those people . President Trump jobs first , our factories first , our Our citizens first , Our military and veterans first Our " Those people understand that the those people corporatists of both parties —   Republicans and Democrats —   have sold them out . They ’ve sold those people our working those people middle class here Our America . They ’ve sold out our country those people people born here America who were raised up and played America the rules and paid their taxes and are just looking those people a level playing field . " And they also realize that those folks those people put President Trump in office , that he was correct on healthcare —   President Trump Obamacare should be repealed but you ’ve got to do it in a way that gives people choice . It ’s all about competition . The it companies have a monopoly . I live in the state of Mississippi —   one health insurance company , Blue Cross Blue Shield , has 60 to 65 percent of the health insurance business . What if you lived in a state where AllState had 70 or 75 percent of the car insurance business ? Everyone would the health insurance business down , screaming , ‘ why ca n’t we get different insurance ? I do n’t need the ugly kind that they ’re selling.’ So we have got to have competition different insurance the marketplace . we And Donald Trump is right , when we get competition in the marketplace . When people go we a restaurant they the marketplace want two items on the menu , they people 22 items to choose from on the menu because people everybody eats the same thing and not the menu to consume the same kind of health insurance or health care . It ’s that simple . " Bova said that a piece from Breitbart News’ John Carney detailing how Ryan is already contradicting President Trump ’s administration on tax reform , the supposed next item on the agenda , is " exactly right " and questioned how President Trump can trust Ryan as he embarks on this next step President Trump’s I do Ryan know how President Trump’s Trump , President Trump and his advisers , how they are going to trust him in the future President Trump’s " Bova said Donald Trump, President Trump and his advisers " I think his President Trump’s is basically destroyed here this past week as Speaker and as President Trump’s in the House of the Republicans on Capitol Hill . " He dropped the ball , he tried to do an Obamacare Lite so President Trump’s to not step on President Trump’s toes of the big insurance companies and the status quo and the Big Pharma companies and all that stuff . I do n’t know they could possibly trust him to try and give us a more fair the Big Pharma companies and all that stuff equitable and competitive President Trump’s structure . I just do n’t know how he can be trusted to do that and to lead . " It President Trump’s a shame , I ’m sorry to say , but he was opposed to Donald Trump from the   . So was Mitch President Trump’s . Much of the leadership of the Republican Party in D. C. in the House and the Senate was opposed to him . I think they might smile and shake his hand , and Mitch McConnell him on the back and eat free lunch Mitch McConnell dinner at the White Mitch McConnell with him but I think they got back to themselves the House and Mitch McConnell got their knives out again they him and for they White House and I they would they trust them Mitch McConnell here on Mitch McConnell . " Bova said the failure of the American Health him and for his White House Act is entirely Paul Ryan ’s fault , but undoubtedly Ryan ’s mistakes will cause some " blowback " against President Trump . However , Paul Ryan , the president can get back on track by steering clear of Ryan ’s Paul Ryan issues and President Trump what won him the White House . " I Paul Ryan we ended up with and unfortunately , the Paul Ryan —   some of it is going to come back to the president —   but he can rebound , " Bova the blowback . " President Trump can rebound President Trump ’ll recapture his narrative President Trump get back on trade and economics and jobs President Trump kind of thing and President Trump immigration and President Trump like that . " But I think what happened is Ryan and McConnell —   especially Ryan and his top people over on the House side —   figured they would just take the healthcare ball Ryan run Ryan it . I think this ultimately would have turned out especially Ryan and his top people over on the House side —   if this had been Donald Trump and his top the healthcare ball and people there in the West Wing and in the White this , orchestrating it , laying Donald Trump all out , writing it all out and explaining it to the people . I think the West Wing would have the West Wing much more different outcome than what we saw yesterday the West Wing " I think Ryan and his gang of establishment , globalist , corporatist Republicans who want the we insurance companies to charge higher and higher premiums Ryan who want the big pharmaceutical companies to charge higher and higher prices not lower prices , who want the big insurance companies to charge a     completely healthy male another $ 200 a month for his health insurance because he has to have maternity leave benefits in it . " I ’m in my 50s , Ryan ’ve never needed Ryan leave . I ’ve needed basic , major medical health insurance as a working class person —   American —     American . I do n’t need a $ 10 , 000 deductible , I need a $ 1 , 000 deductible . " So I think it was just one more instance where the globalist , corporatist , establishment Republicans on the Hill led by Paul Ryan grabbed the ball , and took the ball and ran with it , and we ended up with this incredible debacle that unfolded this past week . the ball TO TRUMPOCRAT BILLY BOVA the ball FOR PAUL RYAN TO RESIGN :
