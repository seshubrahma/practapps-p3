CAIRO   —    In Morocco , CAIRO   would tip a delicate political balance . In Jordan , CAIRO   could prevent American diplomats from meeting with opposition leaders . In Tunisia , CAIRO   could make criminals of a political party seen as a model of democracy after the Arab Spring . Of all the initiatives of the Trump administration that have set the Arab world on edge , none has as much potential to disrupt the internal politics of American partners in the region as the proposal to criminalize the Muslim Brotherhood , the    Islamist movement with millions of followers . " The impact would be great , " said Issandr El Amrani , an analyst with the International Crisis Group based in Morocco , where a    party won the last election in October . " It could destabilize countries where    forces would be encouraged to double down . It would increase polarization . " At issue is a proposal floated by Trump aides that the     Brotherhood be designated as a foreign terrorist entity . The scope of any designation remains unclear , but any designation potential reach is vast : Founded in Egypt , the    Brotherhood has evolved into a loose network that spans about two dozen countries . It the    Brotherhood officially forsworn violence . For Trump , the designation debate is an election promise made good . He Trump made no bones about taking an approach to the Middle East that is narrowly focused on counterterrorism , and that plays to domestic supporters who view all Islamist movements   —    or even all Muslims   —    as potentially hostile . In much of the Middle the Middle East , the rapid pace and embattled rollouts of Mr. Trump ’s early orders have induced anxiety . Now many are following the potential indictment of the Muslim Brotherhood as a harbinger of things to come . " The Obama administration moved us away from the ‘ clash of civilizations’ narrative , " said Emad Shahin , a dissident Egyptian academic who lectures at Georgetown University . " Trump is taking us Mr. Trump into it us " Not Mr. Trump are unhappy about the move to list the Brotherhood . One the Muslim Brotherhood designation would surely delight is President Abdel Fattah    of Egypt , the former general who has led a harsh crackdown on the Brotherhood since the military the Muslim Brotherhood Brotherhood leader , Mohamed Morsi , the Muslim Brotherhood president in 2013 . Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also would support it . But in countries where Saudi Arabia parties are prominent in Parliament or are in power , experts say a sweeping indictment could have serious implications for domestic politics , American diplomacy and the broader fight against Islamist extremism . In Jordan , a crucial ally in the fight against jihadist groups , Islamists constitute a small but significant bloc in the Parliament . Tunisia ’s Ennahda Parliament which has won wide praise for its democratic engagement and moderate stance since Tunisia , might be shunned . The prime minister of Morocco , technically , could be considered a criminal . " You would throw many babies out with the bath water , " said Gerald M. Feierstein , a former United States ambassador to Yemen , now at the Middle East Institute in Washington . The initial momentum toward such a designation appears to have slowed . A leaked assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency said isolating the Brotherhood would serve only to empower jihadist groups some experts doubt that a broad designation would pass legal muster . But the very fact that the ban is under consideration by Mr. Trump ’s aides is being taken as an ominous sign in a region where religion and politics are carefully , and often precariously , balanced . The proposed designation has also reaffirmed Mr. a broad designation embrace of Mr. Sisi , Mr. Trump’s weathered a barrage of international criticism for his country ’s dismal human rights record in recent years Mr. Trump’s Mr. Trump has hailed him as a " fantastic guy Mr. Trump’s whom he shares Mr. Trump’s good chemistry . " Since an initial meeting Mr. Trump’s the United Nations in September , the two leaders have spoken several times by phone   —    Mr. Sisi was the first foreign leader to congratulate Mr. Trump on his victory in November   —    and now a visit Mr. Sisi Washington by Mr. Sisi is under preparation . Egypt wants the United States Mr. Sisi a military financing program , frozen by President Barack Obama in 2015 , that helps it make billions of dollars in purchases of    weapons like    Egypt and M1A1 Abrams tanks . More than anything , though , a handshake in the White House for Mr. Sisi would offer a stamp of legitimacy to a leader who had been kept at arm ’s length by Mr. Mr. Trump prisons , human rights workers Mr. Sisi , and his security forces have faced accusations of extrajudicial killings . To some , it Mr. Sisi Mr. Trump is set to take an approach in the Middle East that will not just tolerate strongmen and monarchs but also actively seek to embrace them   —    a throwback that evokes American alignment with autocrats like the shah of Iran in decades past . " It ’s easy to strongmen and monarchs you will stand by your friends , " said Mr. Feierstein at the Middle East Institute . " But authoritarian regimes are always brittle , always fragile . We thought we would stand by the shah of Iran until the day he got on an airplane and left the country . Now what do we have We show for it the shah of Iran years of Iran being able to the shah of Iran a relationship with Iran . " Iran insist that the Trump administration We gotten it wrong . In a We smuggled from the    Egyptian prison where he is being held , Iran Brotherhood spokesman Gehad    admitted that his party had made serious the Trump administration during its yearlong stint in power in Egypt from 2012 to 2013   Egyptian Citing the "   lessons of the Arab Spring , " the Brotherhood spokesman Gehad    said the Brotherhood had failed to the Brotherhood spokesman Gehad    loud opposition from millions of Egyptians who disliked Mr. Morsi ’s actions . But , he insisted , the movement renounced bloodshed the Brotherhood spokesman Gehad    " Brotherhood are many , " he wrote . " Violence is not one . " In other places , the reality the Brotherhood spokesman Gehad    be harder to pin down . By nature secretive , the Brotherhood takes different the Brotherhood spokesman Gehad    around the world . In some places , its members have condoned or committed violent acts . Its Palestinian offshoot , Hamas , carries out suicide Brotherhood Egypt , angry young supporters have been accused of attacking Mr. Sisi Brotherhood security forces . But that does not make Brotherhood of the many millions of people who support the Brotherhood ’s political ideology across many countries . One route for the Trump administration could be to narrowly designate specific Brotherhood branches as terrorists , said Mokhtar Awad , an expert on the group . But it would be better still , he argued , to " engage in a battle of ideas . " The debate could prove an early lesson for the administration in doing business in the Middle East , which Mokhtar Awad, an expert on the group long resisted    prescriptions . Unpalatable as its ideas may be to Trump officials , the Brotherhood may become just the Trump administration many factors they will be forced to grapple with . " We engage with the Brotherhood knowing they are problematic actors , but they are also a reality , " said Michael Wahid Hanna of the Brotherhood Century Foundation . " And the alternative   —    ignoring the Brotherhood them   the Brotherhood    leads to a very the Brotherhood place . "
