’   ’ ’    For a moment , it looked like August 9 was the day the election    was over . ’ ’    Hillary Clinton was up by nearly 8 points in the    RealClearPolitics polling average .    members of the    Republican Party were criticizing members of the   Republican Party own nominee . And Donald    Trump , suffering through perhaps the most brutal stretch of Donald   Trump    campaign , added to a spate of    wounds when Donald   Trump     that day suggesting Second    Amendment supporters could take action against a President    Clinton to prevent a President   Clinton from nominating      control Supreme Court justices . ’ ’    Fast forward five weeks . Trump , having completely   and displaying a new approach on    the campaign trail , has caught up . ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    And so , seven weeks out of Election Day , . National    polling shows Clinton leads by an average of 1 . 5 points in a       race . In a    split with Libertarian Party    nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein included ,    Jill Stein lead is even smaller   —    about 1 . 1 points . ’ "    Trump has also improved Trump standing in key battleground states .    The biggest shocker came in Michigan , a state Trump has promised to    put in play but that so far has stuck to    reliably Democratic    swing of late . ( Michigan has voted for the Democratic nominee in    every presidential election since 1992 . ) A   of the state    found Clinton ’s lead shrinking from 11 points to just 3   —    within    the poll ’s margin of error . " "    Michigan was n’t the only state that swung toward the Republican    nominee : " "    Reuters’ projections now see Election Day   showing a 60 %    chance of a Clinton win by 18 electoral votes . Nate Silver ’s     also gives    Clinton 60 % odds as of Saturday . " ’   ’ ’    It comes after perhaps the most   as    the former secretary of state took fire    for referring to " half " of Trump’ ’s supporters as    " deplorables " and amid continued fallout over the former secretary of state campaign’ ’s    decision to only reveal the former secretary of state had been battling pneumonia    after a health scare at a    memorial event . ’ "    It has become apparent that the    cycle is affecting    Clinton ’s standing . ( It ’ll take a bit to reveal whether Trump    again   a subject that    has done Trump    no favors , will have any moving effect on polls . ) " "    As   her decline appeared to be    leveling off late last week , but continued further into this    week . Trump    said if polls still look like this a week from now ,    right ahead of the candidates’ first debate at Hofstra    University , it ’ll be time time for Clinton supporters to panic . " ’   ’
