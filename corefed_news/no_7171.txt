" There are a lot of people that do n’t feel the way those racists feel , and those racists voted for Trump" for a whole different reason . And if we do n’t respect where those racists ’re coming from and be willing to engage in dialogue and debate based on that level , then we ’re no better than the racists that we ’re decrying right now . we have a responsibility to be that way . " " No , that ’s not true . we are still better than those racists . But you ’re right .
