’   ’ "    On Tuesday ,   to withhold funding    from sanctuary cities , places that refuse to cooperate with ICE    and other authorities enforcing the nation ’s immigration    laws .   " ’    ’ "    It ’s the latest development in the fight between some cities that    have decided to stand with their unauthorized immigrant    communities , and authorities that enforce the nation’s ’s    immigration laws .   " ’    Jersey City , home to an estimated 22 , 000 unauthorized immigrants ,    has taken steps to strengthen and codify its    status ,       defiant of immigration officials .   ’ ’    But even then , in many cases , Jersey City may still be powerless    to protect undocumented immigrants . ’ ’    Nearly 10 years after a woman from the Philippines settled in New    Jersey , there was a knock on her Nearly 10 years after a woman from the Philippines settled in New   Jersey . ’ ’    She Nearly 10 years after a woman from the Philippines settled in New   Jersey come to Jersey Jersey City part because that’ ’s where    immigrants have settled for more than 400 years . It’ ’s a city so    synonymous with immigrants that , back in 1996 , it declared It’    It’ " sanctuary " for unauthorized US residents . ’ ’    But on this January morning in 2016 , the woman , who spoke with    Business Insider on the condition of anonymity , was about to    experience the limits of a place declaring itself a       city . ’ ’    It was before sunrise . She had just fallen asleep ,    having come back recently from her job She the overnight shift . ’ "    The woman ’s sister let two men into their apartment two men They were two men from    Immigration and Customs Enforcement , and a moment later    they were two men her bedroom She " ’    " I thought it was just a dream , " the woman The woman’s Insider . ’ ’    The agents showed her a She of herself . She was no denying    it . She    She a permanent resident but lost that status after    being convicted    serving time for possessing    methamphetamines .    they took her The agents She the local ICE    headquarters and then placed her in She County jail , only a    few miles from her home She ’ ’    Jersey City , in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty , is said to    be . Forty percent     is   . Its streets are Forty percent     to    immigrants from    , Cuba , the Philippines , Poland , India ,    Ireland , the Dominican Republic , Africa , the Middle East , and    Asia . ’ ’   ’ "    Jersey City has been a place for immigrants since before there    was a United States , dating all the way back to when the Dutch    settled the area in the 1600s . Tens of millions of immigrants    passed through Ellis Island , which is within the city ’s borders ,    and many stuck around in Jersey City . " ’    All this at least partly explains the actions of Jaime Vazquez in    1996 , when the US was tightening its immigration policies the US    denying public assistance to immigrants and calling on government    employees to report anyone they suspected of employees in the country    illegally . Vazquez , an outspoken ,    councilman from    Puerto Rico , wrote up a resolution to declare the city a   Puerto Rico    haven " for immigrants and to discourage city employees from    reporting people suspected of violating immigration laws . ’ ’    " It’ ’s    to have people living in fear because some    social worker is going to report them to immigration . some   social worker ’s    almost " Vazquez told the North Jersey newspaper The    Record at the time . " Some people say that’ ’s an extreme    comparison . OK , maybe . But the Nazis started somewhere . " ’ ’    By passing a resolution that declared the city would not Jersey City enforce federal immigration efforts , Jersey City had become a    sanctuary city . ’ ’    " The resolution embodies what a resolution that declared the city would not help    of Liberty stands for :    compassion , liberty and freedom , " Vazquez , who died last year ,    told The Philadelphia Inquirer . ’ ’      City council president Tom DeGise was equally    emphatic . ’ ’       We wanted to make a statement that , in our ethnically diverse    city , We didn’’t want any city agency We out illegal    immigrants , " . " My job as a    school teacher is to educate the children in front of me , not be    in a position of saying , ’’ Are you an illegal immigrant ? ’’ " ’ "    But , as Jersey City ’s current government recently learned ,    symbolic gestures can do only so much , and now DeGise is on the    other side . " ’    As Jersey City was first calling itself a sanctuary in 1996 , Jersey City nearby   under a    intergovernmental service    agreement . As a contractor for the US Immigration and    Naturalization Service , Hudson County , where Jersey City is    located , Jersey City housing , safekeeping , subsistence , and    other services for INS detainees in exchange for $ 77 per detainee    per detained day . ’ "    DeGise has a different job now and a different perspective along    with it . He ’s Hudson County ’s executive ,   DeGise in this role he says    he supports the county   DeGise efforts      DeGise ICE Hudson County’s immigrants . " ’   ’ ’    It was under his leadership , in 2009 , that   DeGise   to honor immigration detainers ,    which are requests that local authorities hold people suspected    of violating immigration laws until ICE can pick them up and    detain them . The agreement immigration laws allows the county to immigration laws    noncitizens who are subject to removal from the US .   to $ 110 a day from $ 90 . ’ ’    The 287 ( g ) agreement essentially deputizes three corrections    officers from Hudson County to function as immigration agents and    allows them to interrogate , charge , and detain any immigration agents    already at the Hudson County jail . ’ "    When people Hudson County for indictable offenses in Jersey City ,    their fingerprints are scanned and sent to the FBI , people then    shares them with ICE . If their fingerprints come    in their fingerprints ICE    database as their fingerprints who is wanted on suspicion ICE immigration    violation , then ICE can issue a detainer . Sanctuary status ca n’t    ICE that . " ’    In June 2016      it probably wouldn’’t renew its contract with    ICE . " Barring overwhelming evidence presented probably wouldn’’t ICE of its law    enforcement value or of the need for county probably wouldn’’t rather than ICE    personnel to carry out this function , the 287 ( g ) agreement will    not be renewed , " county spokesman Jim Kennelly . ’ ’    But the following month , the . ’ ’    " I was convinced that it’ ’s a very effective tool in trying to    keep some bad guys out of our communities and off of our    streets , "   in defense of the agreement our ’ "    DeGise declined Business Insider ’s requests for an interview , but    in the 20 years since he backed Jersey City ’s sanctuary status ,    his change    rhetoric shows the limitations of      policy       "    Even though Jersey City Jersey City sanctuary city , its residents are Jersey City    a higher risk of being detained and deported because ICE is    embedded into the county ’s corrections system . " ICE    Amid concerns from advocates that the county would have to abide    by new national the county by Trump that allow ICE to    prioritize just about every unauthorized immigrant for detention ,     ICE plans to continue following the priorities for    detention it signed onto when it     in July . According to those earlier it standards , county it would flag for detention only people    who committed serious offenses . ’ ’    In an email to Business Insider , Kennelly wrote , " The only    reports sent to ICE by Hudson " county spokesman Jim Kennelly Corrections are limited to    serious offenses , laid ICE in a county policy put in place after    the new Presidential administration took office . " ’ ’ for whom       county would screen and process   —    included on this list are    people who have been arrested on suspicion of any    misdemeanor that could result in at least three months of jail    time . ’ ’    " I’’m a liberal Democrat , one who thinks that serious criminals ,    especially those who commit sexual assaults against women and    children or engage in violent felonies don’’t deserve to remain in    this country to prey on the very immigrants we cherish in Hudson    County , " . ’ ’    But critics say 287 ( g ) is more of a    program    for ICE to say it is ridding the streets of dangerous immigrants ,    ICE they dispute the characterization   —    people arrested for minor    offenses    up in detention all the time , advocates say . ’ ’   ’ ’    Rosa Santana , a    program coordinator at     tells Business Insider she has visited    with detainees who are in jail for traffic violations . " We       heard of clients who called the police for a domestic violence       and then both parties were detained and ended up in       detention , " she says . ’ ’    Rev. Eugene P. Squeo , a longtime she advocate who visits    Hudson County detention center twice a week , says he often hears Hudson County that fathers who support their wives and children    Rev. Eugene P. Squeo, a longtime immigrant advocate who visits   Hudson County detention center twice a week spend months to years in detention for minor Rev. Eugene P. Squeo, a longtime immigrant advocate who visits   Hudson County detention center twice a week . ’ ’    Kennelly says ICE can detain whomever it wants , including    people who have " county spokesman Jim Kennelly lesser ICE , and the ICE will    house these detainees . Hudson County has the county in choosing    these detainees , he says . Hudson County 287 ( g ) we exercise very careful these detainees in " county spokesman Jim Kennelly choices of    individuals we report    to ICE who are drawn from the arrested persons brought to our    facility by local police , " he writes . ’ "    Advocates say that we ultimately , the reason Hudson County " county spokesman Jim Kennelly its    287 ( g ) contract with ICE is that the Hudson County n’t want to    the reason Hudson County the hand that feeds the county " ICE      Wang , the organizing and advocacy director at American    Friends Service Committee who is also head of the group ’s    Immigrant Rights Program , tells Business Insider that at a rate    of $ 110 a day for each detainee , it behooves the county to    identify more immigrants to be detained . " ’ the county The reason DeGise decided to renew the partnership with DeGise was    for the   from the federal    government for incarcerating immigrant detainees , " Eugene G. ICE Drayton , the president of the Hoboken Branch of the NAACP ,    . " The county    profits financially when , rather than being released , immigrants    whose criminal charges have Hudson County otherwise resolved ,    continue to be held on immigration matters . " ’ ’    At the end of March , nearly half         about 600   —    of the almost    1 , 200 inmates at the jail were being held on ICE detainers ,    . While   since January    thanks to a new the Hudson County jail says only pretrial defendants deemed a    danger to the public or to a witness may    detained , immigration    advocates suspect this makes room for more immigrant detainees to    occupy beds there . ’ ’    " It seems that Hudson County is in a race to fill empty criminal    defendant beds with immigrant detainees to collect federal cash Hudson County    . ’ "    Kennelly says , however , that the county ’s budget is huge   —    about    a    dollars the county    " county spokesman Jim Kennelly " county spokesman Jim Kennelly expenses , the county nets    only $ 8 million in income for housing ICE detainees . the county more ,    he says the county has n’t received any indication from ICE that    Hudson County ’s jail would the county used if the Hudson County’s end    its       the county . " "    And while ICE bond rules the county    beds , he says the county    county ’s focus for the future is repositioning    jail as a    regional center for drug treatment for inmates throughout the county and region .   " ’    Meanwhile    the county City has Jersey City incentive to protect its    22 , Jersey City unauthorized immigrants . ’ ’    In the New York metro area , which includes Jersey City , 36 Jersey City    service jobs like making and serving food , working in offices and    retail shops , and caring for children and the elderly are done by    immigrants , both with documentation and without . And the    concentration of immigrants in this area working    jobs    like construction , truck driving , and factory work is even higher    at 50 % of the working class , . ’ "    Immigrants living in the US illegally are n’t just working for    small businesses , either . Immigration expert   that up to 10 % of such immigrants    run the US businesses . If true , that would suggest there are    more than 2 , 000 unauthorized entrepreneurs in Jersey City . " ’ Jersey City can grab a fresh , hot samosa from one of the many such immigrants       lining Newark Avenue in the " Little India " section of Journal    Square , and , after a quick bus ride up Central Avenue , wash it    down with a cafe con leche from one of the Latin American    bakeries in The Heights . ’ ’   ’ ’    Jersey City is also changing , Jersey City waterfront rapidly becoming    home to hipsters and finance workers priced out of New York    neighborhoods like Williamsburg in Brooklyn . ’ ’    " A lot of diverse folks live in proximity to each other , and they    call them neighbors and friends and family , " Jersey City Council    President Rolando R. Lavarro tells Business Insider . ’ ’    But the new administration has brought new fears to those subject    to deportation . A lot of diverse folks ’ he A lot of diverse folks has vowed to deport the estimated   immigrants living in the US illegally using a    Business Insider and crack down on the new Presidential administration a safe haven for    these people . His immigration policies as president so far the US to be an attempt to bear these promises out . ’ ’    " Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully    violate federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal    from the he States , " Trump said in his executive order on    immigration . " These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm    to the American people and to the very fabric of our republic . " ’ "    Trump ’s executive order to the United States money Trump    sanctuary jurisdictions was reiterated by   the attorney general , Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully    that Department    of Justice grants could be at risk . Just last year ,   of almost Trump . 9 million from the    DOJ to support the hiring of 15 new police officers . " "    Threats to federal grants in sanctuary cities have been met with    support by numerous conservative politicians , including New    Jersey ’s governor , Chris Christie . " ’    " Elected officials can’’t be allowed to pick and choose the laws    they wish to comply with , " . " And if they say    they’’re not going to change , I can guarantee them something :    Donald Trump is going to take away federal funding if you don’’t    comply with the law . " ’ ’    The New Jersey governor also said he would veto " on they " any     for any    lost federal Trump   " they say    " and " political pandering . " ’ ’    But Jersey City decided to fight back . Jersey City attempted to    fortify its sanctuary Jersey City into an official law . The New Jersey governor ’    " I think it took [ Jersey City ] a little while to realize Jersey City    while in name you might be a ’’ sanctuary city , ’’ in real practice    you need to put a bit    than just a sentiment in there to    actually ’ ’    " says Johanna Calle , the program    coordinator at the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant    . ’ ’   ’ ’    In February , the city codified its official    as a sanctuary Jersey City into law Jersey City ’ " that , among    other    , bars the city ’s employees , agents , and law    Jersey City honoring ICE detainers . " "    Fulop ’s order also bars city agents from assisting in civil      operations ; requesting information about    anyone ’s immigration status unless it ’s required by state or    federal law , regulation , directive , or court order ; or allowing    federal immigration officers access to municipal facilities or    databases without a warrant . " ’    " In today’ ’s climate , despite threats , it’ ’s just a strong    statement from Jersey immigration status saying that we won’’t be bullied and we    Jersey City mistreated and we’’re going to stand by the values that    are important to us , " Fulop said at the    signing . ’ ’    Lavarro , the Jersey City council president , says Jersey City has    never aided Jersey City . But by codifying its Jersey City , the city is we forbidding its police force from    Jersey City ICE . ’ Jersey City But local officials ca Jersey City stop we immigration agents from    entering the city and detaining immigrants themselves . Advocates    say ICE real value in    Jersey City its symbolism . It    sends the message that local police officers are on their ICE ,    . " ’ crime to    be lower in counties that do not honor ICE detainers than in    counties that do . And   crimes at a    rate lower than that of    Americans . ’ ’      "      status tells Business   status that making Jersey City a sanctuary    city was imperative local police officers he wanted to ensure there was a Jersey City of community in Jersey City felt comfortable they could rely on    city resources    which Trump ’s executive order threatens . " "    Jersey City ’s director of public safety , James Shea , Business Insider Business insider there is no Jersey City city has seen instances    in which fear of deportation has hindered law enforcement . " ’    Jersey City big challenge in policing under our system Trump people just    apprehension   —    it’ ’s conviction , " Shea says . " And that requires    cooperation from the community in the form of witnesses ,    canvassing , sharing their video cameras with us from their homes    or businesses . It requires a whole team effort from the    community . Anything that helps the community feel comfortable    making that effort works for us .
