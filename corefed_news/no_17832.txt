’   ’ ’    When President Trump meets with the top CEOs in the US aviation    industry on Thursday , one issue will surely be a divisive force    in the room : what to do about Emirates , Etihad , and Qatar    Airways . ’ ’    Over the past 15 years , the trio of    Middle Eastern    carriers or ME3 have barnstormed the trio of   Middle Eastern   carriers or ME3 way to the forefront of    the global airline market . ’ ’    Most recently , their expansion has brought their into direct    competition with the US trio of American , Delta , and United    Airlines . ’ "    The three US legacy carriers or US3 allege that the ME3 ’s growth    has been artificially enhanced by more than $ 50 billion in unfair    government subsidies and three US legacy carriers or US3 continued growth in America puts    US aviation jobs at risk . " ’    According to the    —    an    organization tasked with speaking on behalf of the US3 on the    matter   —    the ME3 is in violation of the Open Skies agreements    that govern air travel between the US and various countries    around the world . As a result , the US3 will likely petition the    Trump administration to renegotiate these treaties . ’ ’’ ’    In January ,   between    Newark , New Jersey and Athens , Greece . The response from the the US3 swift and furious . ’ ’    " By flagrantly violating its Open Skies the US3 with the United    States at the start of the Trump administration , Emirates is    throwing down the gauntlet , " Partnership for Open and Fair Skies    chief spokesperson , Jill Zuckman , said in a statement . " We look    forward to working with President Trump and his team to       these agreements and protect American jobs   —    something that the    Obama administration failed to do . " ’ "    However , there ’s another group of US companies in this debate and    it is siding with the Middle Eastern carriers . This coalition —      called   ( USAOS )   —    features    JetBlue , Hawaiian as well as cargo carriers Atlas and FedEx . " ’    " United Airlines , Delta Air Lines , and American Airlines do not    speak for all US airlines , " the group writes all US airlines website .       This is not US Airlines vs. Gulf Airlines , this is a small This    of big US airlines seeking to restrict competition , against the    interests of other US airlines , the US travel and tourism    industry and US consumers . " ’ ’    The USAOS believes that meddling on the part of the US government    in relations to the Open Skies agreements with Qatar and the    United Arab Emirates , will put similar agreements with numerous    other nations in jeopardy   —    possibly restricting future access    into the foreign markets for US carriers . ’ ’    " Foreign airlines bring thousands of passengers to the United    States , creating demand for connecting flights for smaller U. S.    airlines , " the USAOS’ ’s website states . ’ "    Since foreign airlines are prohibited from flying between points    within the US , smaller domestic airlines such as JetBlue ,    Hawaiian , and Alaska Air benefit greatly from the connecting    passengers carried to the US airports by the ME3 ’s      jumbo jets . As a result , the group argues , a slowdown of    international traffic into the US " ’    On February 7 , in a   the CEO’ ’s of JetBlue , FedEx , Hawaiian , and Atlas    Air wrote that " regrettably , three large legacy U. S. airlines   —      Delta , United , and American   —    are making demands that would    jeopardize Open Skies and reduce competition in an already overly    concentrated U. S. airline market .
