Leaders have to please both conservatives and moderates because Leaders can not depend on Democrats to pick up any slack , creating a delicate balance to prevent loss of any one of their constituencies en masse . Right now there is a dual track effort underway in the House , two committees working in tandem to find a bill that can assuage conservative concerns but all the while ensuring the proposal actually gets passed across the finish line .

" Moderates , meanwhile , are concerned the tax credits would be available to everyone     including the wealthiest Americans . CNN confirmed that one idea being considered is to limit who is eligible for the tax credits so the tax credits would n’t get the money .

" There will come a time very soon where we ’re going to have to have a proposal . And , whether that be the House proposal or the Senate proposal , we ’re going to a proposal and get 218 and 51 , " the aide said .   " So right One senior Republican congressional aide can do what they ’re going to do , but that time for fun members end soon and members will be forced to make a very difficult decision very quickly , " the aide added .
