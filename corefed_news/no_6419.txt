The New England Patriots will face off against the Atlanta Falcons a week from Sunday in the Super Bowl , and as the big game looms an interesting relationship takes center stage : The New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady ’s friendship with President Donald Trump . [ Sports Illustrated ’s Melissa Jacobs reported on Tuesday about Quarterback Tom Brady recent interview with WEEI radio hosts Kirk and Callahan , who asked about his Kirk he replied President Donald Trump " Kirk does everybody make such a big deal ? I do n’t understand it . " Jacobs writes of Brady Melissa Jacobs answer :   On the surface , it makes sense . The fact that we have such an intense obsession with a football player ’s celebrity friends feels at times asinine . Except we ’re not talking about any pedestrian friendship —   this is a divisive incoming president who continues to strategically use his relationship with the Patriots , and Brady in particular , as an asset . When Trump , at his    Day dinner Trump Thursday , immediately pivoted from thanking his family to telling Trump Robert Kraft , ‘ Your friend Tom just Tom Brady feels good . Trump called to congratulate Trump , he feels good,’ that Trump news that transcended sports . When Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway appeared on national television and said , ‘ President Trump is just so grateful Trump like Tom Brady are loyal and can ignore the shrapnel , the verbal shrapnel , hell no , we ’re not just going to move friends like Tom Brady are loyal and can ignore the shrapnel, the verbal shrapnel, hell and start dissecting the offensive line . Brady , of all people , Tom Brady understand this dynamic . Jacobs adds that Brady has moved on from being Tom Brady a " a stunningly gifted , Super Bowl    future Hall of Fame football player " to having now " morphed into a superhero " who is " deeply intertwined with his brands , " an iconic cultural Jacobs in his own right . The Boston Herald Jacobs Steve Buckley adds that since " these are no ordinary times , " and the country " has been transformed into a     high school cafeteria , and a food fight of biblical proportions is just getting under way , " the matter of who someone " voted for " and who they " supported " in the election " all is a big deal . " " And it ’s an even bigger deal when you happen to be the greatest quarterback of all time who happens also to be friends with our newly inaugurated president , " Buckley writes . The New York Daily News argues that Brady ’s actions " normalize " Trump . " By being friends with Trump and having that friendship be public Trump Brady is tacitly condoning the president whether Brady means to or our newly inaugurated president " Seth our newly inaugurated president wrote . " It normalizes Trump in a very    situation . And Trump the very least , Trump has certainly taken advantage of Brady ’s Trump as a campaign tool . Brady BarStoolPolitics’ Jerry Thornton writes that since the Patriots are " despised " except by their most ardent fans —   and the same goes for Trump —    he has " no problem with Trump this media BarStoolPolitics’ Jerry Thornton . " Even more to the point , I say : Bring it , " Thornton writes . " Give them your worst . BarStoolPolitics’ Jerry Thornton Patriots are despised anyway , why not go the Patriots ? Everyone besides the 60 million who voted for Trump see him as a sinister ,    archvillain Trump on Trump the world and enslaving the survivors , I say the Pats might as well be his evil ,    Number Two . " Interestingly enough the Pats however , everyone who despises either Brady and the Patriots , Trump , or both seems to be missing a Trump theme here : Brady ’s story and Trump ’s story are very similar Brady Trump , everyone now agrees , is someone who defied Trump’s odds and went on to win the presidency after taking basically everybody on . Two political dynasties —   the Bushes and the Clintons —   lay in his wake , as does the media industry as a whole , the Republican establishment , the left , and so many other enemies he took on and crushed in his meteoric rise to his top . He also did his follow the conventional playbook to get his , and reworked his own methodology outside the norms of traditional politics . his has also falsely been accused of cheating in the election , and not being the rightful winner , multiple ways —   whether it be the electoral college versus the popular vote , allegations of Russian hacking , or so many other issues . Brady , similarly , has fought against the odds . The media correctly admits to that hatred of him , and the NFL ’s establishment —   including Brady Roger Goodell —   have an awkward way of dealing with him . It ’s now a headline story on CBS Brady Boston that Goodell thinks " it would be an honor " commissioner Roger Goodell the Lombardi Trophy to Brady if the Patriots win the Super Bowl again in a little over a week —   something the NFL commissioner routinely does at every Super Bowl . Like Trump , Brady and the Patriots have been accused of cheating multiple times Brady   the Patriots Spygate , then there was    —   and they ’ve had to battle it out with the NFL in court Trump, Brady and the Patriots First the courts sided with Brady and overturned a    suspension , then on appeal they Brady with the NFL and made Brady sit out the first Trump, Brady and the Patriots games of the NFL in court the NFL in court Brady has come back to put up impressive numbers in 12 Brady season games —   stats that rival some quarterbacks who played all 16 —   and tore through the criticism of him in the media to ramrod his way back to the Brady Bowl for a shot at Brady another ring . And Brady , throughout his career , achieved all this success alongside Brady Patriots coach Brady Belichick by rewriting the traditional rules of football , doing things their own way . Goodell , the NFL commissioner , is so despised by New England fans that they actually started a " WHERE IS ROGER ? " chant at the Goodell, the NFL commissioner opener after their last Super Bowl win when Goodell pushed the " " conspiracy , Goodell, the NFL commissioner was designed to delegitimize Brady ’s and the Patriots’ last win in the big time . Brady ’s endorsement of Trump did n’t come early enough to make the Brady difference in New Hampshire —   it could have changed more hearts and minds in a battleground state had it come just a few days , or even a week , earlier it   but his friendship certainly helped deliver Trump his first primary state win in the Granite State back in February Trump his In New England , Brady ’s " Make America Great Again " hat on display in his Patriots locker was something of lore —   helping Trump break through criticisms and beat back the institutional left ’s and establishment Trump ’s clamps on culture , opening New Englanders’ ears to Trump ’s message . More importantly , though , both men —   Trump Brady —   have taken on establishments , entrenched institutions , and the media . And both men have kept on winning . Perhaps even more hilariously , though , More importantly, though, both men —  Trump and Brady —   Trump have now both been accused of being part of the establishments they Brady Trump Democrats in Congress Brady and Trump now accusing Trump of being " the establishment Brady and Trump " and Brady was regularly demeaned as Trump the establishment in the NFL . Nothing could further Brady the truth . And if Brady puts up another win a week from Sunday , expect that phone call from the Brady of the United States in the locker room —   it will be a President Trump of them will be ashamed of it .
