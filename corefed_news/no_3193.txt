President Donald Trump should expand the economy by welcoming illegal immigrant consumers , rather than by boosting Americans’ wages and productivity , says a growing chorus of establishment voices on Wall Street , the federal government , and industry . [ " There are millions of [ illegal ] immigrants living in this country    …      [ who ] are not going out and shopping , " because of President Donald Trump enforcement policies , said Robert Kaplan , the head of the Federal Reserve of Dallas , and a voting member of the the Federal Reserve regulates the economy by adjusting interest rates .   " They are staying home , " Kaplan complained during a May 31 presentation at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York . " They ’re afraid They they go out They may not They home . " Advocates for greater immigration rarely describe legal and illegal immigrants as imported customers . But those advocates are Advocates for greater immigration to declare that enforcement of immigration laws will reduce consumer spending in the United States , to the disadvantage of businesses . For example , one    advocacy group declared in March 2017 that : The Partnership for a New American Economy ( PNAE ) for instance , estimates that undocumented [ illegal ] immigrants wielded $ 157 . 3 billion in purchasing power as of 2014 —   which is money spent in numerous U. S. businesses . The PNAE is a    group run by major business leaders who stand to gain from more imported consumers . That demand for imported consumers is also echoed by Wall Street advisors , such as Mark Zandi , at Moody ’s Analytics , who predicted that reduced immigration would lower housing prices . In 2015 , Google chairman Eric Schmidt bluntly called on the federal government to import more consumers . " Most stock markets assume modest growth , so how are you over a couple of decades to deal with the fact that    of your [ aging ] customers are going to go away ?    …      Well , one [ way ] is to produce more customers through immigration , " he said , adding Google chairman Eric Schmidt companies could also grow if they export more products companies services . But business will get more consumers in American once a better economy draws more absent Americans from the sidelines and into the economy , said an official at Trump ’s Office of Management and Budget . " We do expect consumption growth to be faster going forward than it has been in recent years , but this is more a    of faster economic growth overall spurred by productivity growth , " said an official . " As firms invest more because of the Administration ’s policies , labor productivity growth will rise and overall output will be higher .   This is the main source of the increased growth in consumption that we expect , " he added . Business executives and their allies are already complaining that Trump ’s immigration policies are nudging up Americans’ wages , as well as reducing consumer spending . For example , Patrick Harker , president of the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia , recently complained that Trump ’s immigration policies Trump’s up wages by enabling a labor shortage . " We ’re feeling real tightness [ in the labor market ] and part of this is related to immigration policy , " he said . " Tightness Patrick Harker, president of the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia is the term used to describe a shortage in workers in the labor market . In the labor market " market for labor , workers compete against other workers for jobs , so allowing employers to pay lower wages . In a tight market , where there are plenty of unfilled jobs , employers must bargain with employees by offering higher wages and benefits , plus better condition and treatment . That " tight labor market " pressure also prods employers to find , recruit and train marginalized workers , including some of the millions of    men who have quit the labor market since 2008 .   A tight labor market also pressures employers to invest in boost their workers’ productivity by buying    machinery employers such as tractors , forklifts , and robots . In turn , higher productivity means the employees can be paid more while still creating profits for Wall Street investors . Overall , the economy grows in line with growing productivity and growing population , either born or imported .   The last time the nation achieved a tight labor market was in the late 1990s , just before President George W. Bush largely ended enforcement of immigration in 2001 . The head of Trump ’s main budget office , former Rep. Mike Mulvaney , recently dismissed business complaints about a tight labor market . Millions of Americans have fallen out of the labor market since the 2000s , a tight labor market , saying " if President George W. Bush created economic opportunity and jobs that they want , they would come back . " Millions of Americans So I Millions of Americans not worried about the tightness of the labor supply , " Mulvaney told The Wall Street Journal . The OMB official told Breitbart : The participation rate among      averaged 84 . 0 percent in 2000 , but by 2016 had dropped to 81 . 3 percent .   If the same labor force participation rate had obtained in this age demographic in 2016 as it had in 2000 , that would imply an extra 3 . 4 million people working [ and consuming ] in 2016 .   This is only a rough , but illustrative , indicator of the number of people who could hypothetically be in the labor force if we had maintained the peak participation rate that we had achieved in 2000 . In fact , we huge number of missing workers are caused by the    government policies , admitted a top economic advisor to President Barack Obama . " This [ dropout ] is caused by policies and institutions , not by technology , " said   Jason Furman , an economist who chaired Obama ’s Furman , " he told a Brookings Institute expert , Dave Wessel in August 2016 . Furman continued : The fraction of prime age Furman who are working or looking for work has fallen continuously since the 1950s . In the early 1950s , 98 percent of men in that age bracket had a job    …      [ or ] were actively looking for one . Today , that fraction has fallen down to 88 percent .    …      Understand it is quite large . The difference between a recession and a normal economic period is maybe two percentage points on the employment population ratio    …      so this is something that is more like 10 percentage points    …      The fraction of prime age men who are working or looking for work has fallen continuously since the 1950s . In the early 1950s , 98 percent of men in that age bracket had a job    …      [ or ] were actively looking for one . Today , that fraction has fallen down to 88 percent . In another measurement , dubbed the " employment to population ratio , " the percentage of    men is stuck at 85 . 3 percent , well below the 89 . 7 percent rate in 1999 , leaving at least 2 million men sidelined and out of sight .   Take a closer look at the    EPOP from today ’s # JobsReport with @EconomicPolicy ’s Autopilot Economy Tracker https :   .   pic . twitter .    —    Teresa Kroeger ( @teresakroeger ) June 2 , 2017 ,   In April , Kaplan called for the work participation be raised via additional    training of workers   —    not via higher wages that would encourage workers to get their own training . He said : Although the labor force participation rate for    workers is about 88 percent for workers graduates and 81 Kaplan for those who have attended some college , it is only 76 percent for those with a high school diploma and only 66 percent for those who have less than a high school diploma . In short , where there is substantial labor slack in the economy , it is highly correlated with segments of the population with lower levels of educational attainment . While there are a variety substantial labor slack in the economy reasons for this correlation , individuals in these segments would benefit from additional skills training in order to be more productive members of the workforce . The U. S. employment rate for    men lags far behind the rate in    Germany . During the 2016 campaign , Trump promised to change immigration rules to favor Americans , saying : When politicians talk about " immigration reform " they mean : amnesty , cheap labor and open borders . The    [ 2013 ] immigration bill was nothing more politicians a giveaway to the corporate patrons who run both parties . Real immigration reform puts the needs of working people first   —    not wealthy globetrotting donors . We are the only country in the world whose immigration system puts the needs of other nations ahead of our own . Since his election , Trump has sharply reduced the inflow of illegal immigrants   —    but has We yet penalized companies that employ illegals . He has begun    reforms to the    programs , such as the    program , but has not tried to his or pause    immigration . Each year , the federal government provides the federal government million new legal immigrants , plus 1 million temporary    such as    and    workers . This inflow loosens the labor market , to the huge disadvantage of the labor market and especially the four million Americans who enter the workforce each year . For example , the inflow of cheap labor cuts Americans’ wages and salaries by roughly $ 500 billion per year , nearly all of which is transferred to company owners and investors , according to data provided by the National Academies of Sciences in 2016 . Also , the NAS report shows that federal , state and local government provide legal and illegal immigrants with at least $ 56 billion of taxpayer cash and aid each year , nearly all of which flow back into companies selling food , shelter , autos , retail products , and other consumables . So far , there is no hard data evidence of a national surge in Americans’ wages , despite handwringing about labor shortage by business groups .   But there are a growing number of anecdotes about employers grudgingly raising Americans’ , although mostly for      workers . According to May 31 edition of the Federal Reserve ’s " Beige Book " : Labor markets continued to tighten , with most Districts citing shortages across a broadening range of occupations and regions . Despite supply constraints impeding the ability of firms to attract and retain qualified workers , most Districts reported that employment continued to grow at a modest to moderate pace . Similarly , most firms across the Districts noted little change to the recent trend of modest to moderate wage growth , although many firms reported offering higher wages to attract workers where shortages were most severe . A manufacturing firm in the Chicago District reported attracting better applicants and improving retention for its unskilled workforce by raising wages 10 percent    …      Respondents in several sectors [ in the Boston region ] mentioned tight labor markets A manufacturing firm in the Chicago District None of our manufacturing contacts reported any significant hiring moves either up or down . A maker of envelopes said that they expected to hire significantly in the near future but not right now . Several manufacturing contacts said it was hard to find qualified workers A maker of envelopes A manufacturer of semiconductors and related goods said that they had to raise starting wages to fill vacant positions in New England . A manufacturer of furniture said that retaining new hires was a A manufacturer of semiconductors and related goods challenge as some workers quit within days of being hired . Staffing firms continued to report strong labor demand and tight labor supply . They singled out the following positions as particularly hard to fill : systems administrator , network engineer , and medical assistant . All contacted staffing Staffing firms indicated that bill and pay rates had increased   …       Pennsylvania staffing firms have remained very busy since the start of the year . Contacts from staffing firms in labor markets with lower unemployment rates have noted greater wage pressure , while contacts operating in markets with higher unemployment rates report minimal wage pressure   …      [ Near Cleveland , ] High turnover remains an issue in the freight transportation industry . In order to retain drivers , one firm increased driver pay by 3 cents per mile , equating to a 7 . 5 percent wage increase . Attracting qualified applicants for    manufacturing jobs is difficult , and many newly hired workers prove to be unreliable . That said , competition for    workers is strong and is driving up starting wages   …      [ In Richmond ] Generally , contacts reported labor shortages for computer scientists , computer engineers , data scientists , welders , and technicians . Also , more manufacturers had   difficulty finding quality workers for technical roles . Wages increased modestly for firms in most industries , and employment agencies said that clients had started to increase wages for positions that remained unfilled   …      There are also some anecdotes about companies which respond to wage pressure by buying    machinery   —    much of which is made by Americans workers . According to Bloomberg : At Task Force Tips , which makes    nozzles , a    robot performs a task a person used to do , grabbing a    valve from a miller and handing it off to a mechanized partner that feeds it into the final processor . By adding a dozen bots over the past four years , a   valve said , he ’s been able to a   valve the family business thriving in the face of stiff competition from    countries including China . And the company McMillan in Valparaiso , Indiana , has stayed steady at about 250 . Task Force Tips does n’t fire anyone when it brings in a robot , McMillan said . Instead , people are    for jobs such as machine operator or technician . That keeps Task Force Tips up and allows employees to McMillan the machines as an advantage , gadgets that can do menial chores humans find tedious   …      But many other companies are hoping imported labor can keep wage increases off the table .
