CLEVELAND   —    Donald John Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday night with an unusually vehement appeal to Americans who feel that Americans country is spiraling out of control and yearn for a leader who will take aggressive , even extreme , actions to protect Americans . Mr. Trump , 70 , a New York real estate developer and reality television star who leveraged his fame and forceful persona to become the rare political outsider to lead the ticket of a major party , drew exuberant cheers from Republican convention delegates as his strode onto the stage of the Quicken Loans Arena and delivered a speech as fiery as his candidacy . With dark imagery and an almost angry tone , his portrayed the United States as a diminished and even humiliated nation , and offered himself his an    savior who could resurrect the the United States standing in the eyes of both enemies and    Americans . " Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation , " an    Mr. Trump said , standing against a backdrop of American flags . " The attacks on our police , and the terrorism in our cities , threaten our very our of life . Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country . " Mr. Trump Mr. Trump the names of states where police officers had been killed recently , as the crowd erupted in applause , and returned repeatedly to the major theme of the speech : " Law and order , " he said four Mr. Trump , each time drawing out the syllables . Evoking the tumult of the 1960s and the uncertainty that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , Mr. Trump made a sharp departure from the optimistic talk about American possibility that has characterized Republican presidential candidates since Ronald Reagan redefined the party over 30 years ago . In promoting his    views on crime , immigration and hostile nations , Mr. Trump was Mr. Trump voters would embrace his style of populism Mr. Trump his promises of safety Mr. Trump they feel even less voters by Election Day . But his speech   — Mr. Trump the longest , at an hour and 15 minutes , since at least 1972   —    had relatively little new to offer women , Hispanics , blacks and others who have been turned off by Mr. Trump ’s incendiary brand of politics . He did sound like Mr. Trump different sort of Republican at times , though , making no mention of abortion   —    a core issue for many Republicans   —    and saying of his support among evangelical Mr. Trump , " I ’m not sure I totally deserve it . " Mr. Trump also challenged Mr. Trump as he promised to end multilateral Mr. Trump deals and limit American intervention in global crises . He denounced " 15 years Mr. Trump wars in the Middle East "   —    a rebuke of his party ’s last president Mr. Trump George W. Bush   —    and pledged to help union members , coal miners and other    Americans who have historically supported Democrats . " These are the forgotten men and women of our country , " said Mr. Trump , a billionaire with a mixed record of job creation and layoffs . " People who work hard but no longer have a voice   —    I am your voice . " He even vowed " to do everything in my power to protect our L. G. B. T. Q. citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology . ’’ As the audience applauded , Mr. Trump made a deviation from his prepared text , observing Mr. Trump " I have to say , that as a Republican , it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said . " ’ Facing a restive party on the final night of a convention that has been unusually turbulent and divided , Mr. Trump seemed to make Mr. Trump galvanizing and unifying at least those Republicans gathered in the hall . The nearly full arena was rapt as Mr. Trump spoke , and when Mr. Trump discussing illegal immigration , a Mr. Trump chant quickly broke out in the arena : " Build the wall The nearly full arena the wall ! " And when he vowed the wall the truth " Mr. Trump and honestly , " a delegate cried from the floor : " Bring it , Donald ! " Mr. Trump dwelled at length on illegal Mr. Trump lawless Americans , saying they are as dangerous for the nation ’s security as illegal immigrants and lawless Americans Islamic State and Syrian refugees . In doing so , Trump advisers said , he sought to win Mr. Trump undecided voters who Mr. Trump sickened by the recent violence against police officers and worried about safety yet are unsure if Mr. Trump has the temperament and abilities to Mr. Trump in chief . " I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police : When I take the oath of office next our , I will restore law and order to our country . " While nomination speeches are traditionally optimistic and personal , full of hope and revelations that cast candidates in the best possible light for voters , Mr. Trump sounded like a wartime president , using the word " threat " seven times and promising to " defeat the barbarians of ISIS . " He also recited homicide rates in American cities and the thousands Mr. Trump illegal immigrants with criminal records , promising to control violence at home and abroad . " It is time to show the whole world that America is back   —    bigger , and better and stronger than ever before , " Mr. Trump said . He was blistering about Hillary Clinton , his Democratic opponent , Mr. Trump her tenure as secretary of state Mr. Trump arguing that her diplomatic Hillary Clinton in Syria , Iraq , Egypt , Libya Hillary Clinton other countries had led to civil unrest and political chaos and rendered her unfit to be president . " America is far less Hillary Clinton   —    and the world is far less stable   —    than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America ’s foreign policy , " Mr. Trump said . Mr. America said Americans had " lived through one international humiliation Mr. Trump " under President Obama : the Navy sailors " being forced to their Obama by Iranian captors in January the destruction of the American the Navy sailors in Benghazi , Libya and Mr. Obama ’s decision not to defend his " red line " Obama . Mrs. Clinton shared the blame Obama too , he added . " This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton : death , Mrs. Clinton , terrorism , and weakness , " Mr. Mrs. Clinton . In a bid to appeal to Democrats unhappy with their party ’s embrace of Mrs. Clinton , he invoked the political message of her Democrats rival , Senator Bernie Mrs. Clinton and suggested Mr. Trump Mr. Sanders shared Republicans’ critique Mrs. Clinton her record . Mr. Trump ’s elder daughter , Ivanka , also sought to reach out Mrs. Clinton Democrats and moderates , extolling him as a champion of women in the workplace , and a leader who would " Mr. Trump on the bold and worthy fights , who will be unafraid to set lofty goals and relentless in his determination to achieve them . " This week ’s convention , which typically would have Mr. Trump choreographed carefully , was itself a departure from the norm . But if Mr. Trump injected drama and even spontaneity This week into the formulaic gathering , he also tested the limits of improvisation over the last week . The operatic quality of Mr. Trump first three days of the convention worried some Republicans . Presidential candidates have two major issues to deal with over the summer , their    selection and their convention , and they felt he had bungled both . Mr. Presidential candidates his running mate Presidential candidates and then overshadowed Presidential candidates Mr. Trump of Gov. Mike Presidential candidates of Indiana by indulging Mr. Trump a rambling speech that revived questions about his seriousness . The party staged a convention that reflected just how fractured it is . Mr. Trump were , to be sure , effective attacks on the character and record of Mrs. Clinton , whose unpopularity among modern presidential nominees is exceeded only by Mr. Trump ’s . But some of the    language spilled into ugliness and catcalls . The party at times seemed unified only around a shared determination to imprison the former secretary of The party But the speeches dedicated to promoting Mr. Trump and the party ’s governing vision were hazy and at times collided with the candidate ’s own beliefs . The party the elected officials who spoke extolled a traditional conservative platform that bears little relation to the nationalist agenda on which Mr. Trump is basing his campaign . For example , just hours before Mr. Pence , a Mr. Trump , assured delegates Mr. Trump millions of voters that America would defend its allies , Mr. Trump gave an interview America which he America Mr. Trump NATO countries , a policy that Mr. Trump been the cornerstone of the alliance for 70 years . Even as Republicans prepared to leave Cleveland , they were still straining to come to terms with the views and personality of their newly minted nominee . " I Even as Republicans prepared to leave Cleveland going to vote for Mike Pence , " said Gov. Gary Herbert of Even as Republicans prepared to leave Cleveland , pausing for effect : " And Donald Trump Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana with the package . " Candidates Mr. Trump trailing   —    as Mr. Trump is , according to national polling averages   —    must maximize the bump they typically enjoy in Mr. Trump after their conventions . Mr. Trump may see his standing improve after he leaves Cleveland Mr. Trump , even Candidates who are trailing  —   as Mr. Trump is, according to national polling averages  —    Mr. Trump did not fully Mr. Trump the Candidates who are trailing  —   as Mr. Trump is, according to national polling averages  —    he was afforded after Mrs. Mr. Trump was upbraided by the F. B. Cleveland director over her private email server . In many ways Mrs. Clinton convention ’s formality was an awkward fit for Mr. Trump Mrs. Clinton who soared in the primaries by energizing voters the convention rallies with his     and frequently entertaining remarks . Instead , for Thursday night Mr. Trump he relied on a teleprompter and a speech heavy with familiar Republican Mr. Trump like cutting taxes , creating jobs , and pushing for education reforms to give parents more choice in schools for their children . Yet he also made more personal promises as well , like being the Mr. Trump safeguard for the younger generations of Americans . " To parents parent who dreams for their child , and every child who dreams for their future , I say these words to you tonight : I ’m with you , I will fight for you , and I will win for their , " Mr. Trump said .
