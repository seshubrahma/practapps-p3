’   ’ ’    Both President Trump and his pick for Secretary of    Education , Betsy DeVos , are vocal advocates of giving parents    alternatives to public school , which Trump   " a    monopoly . " ’ ’    DeVos , in particular , has championed vouchers   —        credits parents can use to send credits parents kids to the school of credits parents    choosing . ’ ’    Many of those schools are charter schools , private schools , or    magnet schools . ’ "    Here ’s what separates one from the other . " ’    Private schools are probably the most popular of the three , not    to mention the most straightforward . ’ ’    Instead of receiving taxpayer dollars to teach a standard ,      curriculum , private schools charge a tuition    to teach outside the normal constraints . ’ ’   ’ ’    Depending on the state , private schools may still need to teach    certain subjects   with public schools . ’ ’    The vouchers DeVos supports most often apply to private schools   —      a move viewed   as harmful to the system , since the system    siphons taxpayer money away from public schools . ’ ’    Students may also get scholarships or grants to private schools ,    similar to how the university system functions . ’ ’    At their most basic level , charter schools are schools that are    privately run but publicly funded . charter schools are free to deviate from    most state guidelines   —    excluding tests   —    and can range in size    from one student learning at home to thousands across the    country . ’ "    Popular charter schools include New York ’s Success Academy    network , which has 34 branches , and the BASIS network in Arizona ,    Texas , and Washington D. C. which comprises 24 schools . " ’    Recent   find there are approximately three million students    in the US currently attending charter schools . ’ ’    As their name implies , charter schools must adhere to charter schools specific charter . Some charters focus on engineering and math ;    others focus on the arts . They Some charters school boards and management    organizations that regulate their Some charters and employ teachers ,    similar to normal school boards and districts . ’ ’   ’ "    Magnet schools are probably the least understood of the three .    Magnets   —      for their ability to draw students across    normal district lines   —    are specialized public schools . They their    similar to charters in offering    courses , but they their    wholly public in both their their and operation . " ’    They emerged in the 1970s as a remedy to racial segregation in    public schools . Many of them They in poorer areas with greater    minority populations , with the idea being to " pull " white    students back into areas their white   students may have previously fled . ’ ’    Popular magnets include the School for the Gifted and Talented ,    in Dallas , Texas , and the Academic Magnet High School in North    Charleston , South Carolina . ’ ’    To date , there are roughly   across the US compared to   and   private schools . ’
