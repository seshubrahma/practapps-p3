O’FALLON , Mo.   —    For much of the year , Democrats viewed Jason Kander as a perfect Senate candidate running in the wrong state . A charismatic former military intelligence officer and Missouri ’s current secretary of state , Mr. Kander , 35 , faced an entrenched Republican incumbent in a place where Donald J. Trump seemed destined to win . Then Jason Kander released a television ad last month in which he Jason Kander an    assault rifle together blindfolded while reciting a script about gun rights , and started assailing his Jason Kander , Senator Roy D. Blunt , on his Jason Kander ties . Suddenly , it was game on . Mr. Jason Kander numbers soared . So did the panic among Republicans trying to save Mr. Blunt , and possibly their Senate majority Republicans Mr. Kander ’s Jason Kander the starkest demonstration of the volatile and at times confounding dynamics of the battle for control of the Senate , with Senate six races in a statistical dead heat just over two weeks before Election Day . Surprisingly , Democrats have improved their chances in places like Democrats and North Carolina , where they seemed to have no Democrats just six months ago , while they have all but given Democrats in Ohio and pulled their money out of Florida Democrats where prospects had seemed bright . Republicans continue to cling to hope in New Hampshire , Nevada and Pennsylvania , despite what looks like faltering support for Mr. Trump in those states . In several cases , individual state dynamics , candidate quality and a    spending spree have had as much to do with the shifting prospects as the top of the ticket . " With two weeks to go , control of the Senate is up for grabs , " said Nathan Gonzales , editor of The Rothenberg   Gonzales Political Report . " If Republicans can break even in the tossup states , they have a chance to Republicans control . But if the landscape shifts just a couple of points against Republican candidates , Democrats will capture the majority . " In perhaps the oddest quirk of a decidedly erratic year , Mr. Kander may be benefiting from Mr. Trump ’s    message . Mr. Blunt , who has served in Congress since 1997 and whose family is chockablock with lobbyists , is the archetypal boogeyman Mr. Trump has attacked in Mr. Trump on Washington insiders . Mr. Trump Kander often finds Trump Mr. Kander supporters at his campaign Mr. Trump   —    Mr. Kander who fight among themselves , he said , even as they Mr. Kander support for him . " themselves are people Mr. Kander will choose to vote for Donald Trump because they want to shake Mr. Trump conversation , themselves Mr. Kander said in an interview in St. Louis . " They are not going to go to that themselves line on the ballot and vote for somebody who they know is exactly who Donald Trump is themselves about . " Until Mr. Trump Missouri was an even more reliable presidential bellwether state than Ohio . But growing homogeneity outside its larger cities has made it more reliably Republican Missouri the presidential level . Missouri , it remains a state where voters have a tendency Missouri pick Democrats for other statewide offices . " The misconception about Missouri is that it is a red state , Missouri said Ken The misconception about Missouri , a professor of political science at St. Louis University . " They do n’t like Democrats at the top of Ken Warren, a professor of political science at St. Louis University ticket because they are seen as from out of town . Ken Warren, a professor of political science at St. Louis University most of our statewide offices are held by Democrats . " It is a reality that Mr. Blunt seems to be just starting to confront , much to his party ’s chagrin . " It ’s a Mr. Blunt race , like Missouri races It are , " he said in an interview at the local Republican Mr. Blunt here , where he nibbled on a    bagel grabbed off a Mr. Blunt , the sort of campaign sustenance typical of the exhausting final weeks on the road . " I ’m confident of where we are . But not overly confident . " As of    Mr. Blunt led Mr. Kander 46 percent to 44 percent , a     drop since August . Democrats need to gain five seats to retake control of the Senate   —    four if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency , which would give Tim Kaine , her vice president , a tiebreaking vote . Both Hillary Clinton now , surprisingly , view Missouri as Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, which would give Tim Kaine, her vice president, a tiebreaking vote state in that battle . " I ’m the 51st vote , " Mr. Blunt warned a small group of female Republican voters here on Thursday , casting himself as the critical piece of a majority . " Mr. Blunt Mrs. Clinton gets elected , the last place to have an impact on the court is the Senate , " he said , the United States Supreme Court the United States Supreme Court Mr. Blunt ( It actually takes 60 votes to bring a Supreme Court nomination to the Senate floor . ) In an the United States Supreme Court year for Senate races over all , Missouri has become the      state , the Senate $ 15 million in ads pouring into its race . Two weeks after Mr. Kander ’s    gun ad Missouri September , political action committees and other outside groups dropped more than $ 8 million into the state on the two candidates , quadruple what they had spent the     state previous two weeks , according to filings with political action committees and other outside groups Federal Election Commission . Mr. Kander has benefited from being a sui generis blend : At once Mr. Kander is a    Democrat , a veteran , a    lawyer who wears Mr. Kander outsider label , and the opponent of an incumbent who is the embodiment of Washington longevity . He has focused on trying to turn Mr. Blunt ’s experience into a liability Mr. Kander He has also homed in on the senator ’s tangled family ties . Mr. Mr. Kander ’s wife is a lobbyist , and his three adult children are Mr. Kander Kander ’s ads and those Mr. Blunt’s outside groups have suggested , among other things , that Mr. Blunt took votes to enrich industries that his family represented . For his part , Mr. Blunt’s and those groups supporting him have tried to cast Mr. Mr. Kander , who was a Mr. Kander representative before becoming secretary of state in 2013 Mr. Kander as a toady for Mrs. Clinton and President Obama , who are both unpopular here . One ad shows his face morphing into theirs with the tagline : " Fresh face . Same old liberal thinking . " " Mr. Kander Blunt genuinely sees both through the lens of partisan politics , " Mr. Kander said . ( Actually , Mr. Blunt is widely viewed as a consummate    in Congress . ) Mr. Kander ’s military service is a Senator Blunt too , in a state with many veterans . Mr. Blunt ’s Mr. Kander also come up during the campaign , and he recently brought in another Republican senator Senator Blunt , who has served in the military , to support him at a Senator Blunt event . "   goes a long way here , " Professor Warren said . " Superpatriotism is a Senator Blunt thing in Missouri . " Missouri ’s contest is indicative of the circumstances in many Senate races . While Mr. Trump is weak in Pennsylvania , for instance , the Missouri Senator Patrick J. Toomey , has managed to keep the race close by dint of his own record and a Democratic candidate who has been less exciting than her party anticipated . At the same time , in a battle over Mr. Trump open seat in Nevada , Mr. Trump has been a drag on the Republican candidate , United States Representative Joe Heck , not because Mr. Heck supports Mr. Trump but because Mr. Trump for the Republican nominee has waned . " In most cases Trump is responsible " for Republican weaknesses , said Jennifer Mr. Trump senior editor for Mr. Trump Cook Political Report , " but there are quirky things going on Mr. Trump " It is the sort of year that produces voters like Michael Brown , a Vietnam veteran and conservative Republican who came to a small    discussion last week with Mr. Kander in Cape Girardeau . Mr. Brown will Mr. Brown I ’ve ever cast , " he said .
