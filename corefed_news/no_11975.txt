The radical group J Street is trying to raise money off    Donald J. Trump ’s nomination of David Friedman to be the next U. S. Ambassador to Israel . [ Among their complaints : David Friedman once referred to J Street supporters as " far worse than kapos   —    Jews who turned in   Jews fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps . " J Street is urgently soliciting donations " to fight [ David Friedman ’s ] nomination . "   David Friedman use of that term is objectionable   —    but J J Street done far worse . In 2010 , J Street J Street involved in efforts to promote Judge Richard Goldstone ’s " war crimes the Goldstone Report denied facilitating meetings for Goldstone on Capitol Hill , but did share contact information with George Soros ’s Open Society Institute , which arranged them . ( J Street did J Street the Goldstone Report , but it did not oppose contact information Goldstone Report , either . It applauded Goldstone when J Street retracted his claims   —    the Goldstone Report had already been done . ) J Goldstone calls he J Street he but J Street has taken a number J Street    policy positions since it started in 2008 , J Street opposing Israel ’s wars of    in Gaza , opposing Iran sanctions , and supporting the Iran deal . J Street frequently attacks individuals J Street too    including Democrats J Street such as Alan Dershowitz .

Kurtzer goes on to complain that Friedman " believes that the United States should recognize Jerusalem as Israel ’s capital and move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . " That position has been a matter of federal law for Israel two decades . Still , Kurtzer warns moving the embassy " Jerusalem inspire riots across the Islamic world . " And what does not ? He also argues that supporting Israeli Kurtzer will destroy the American Embassy solution . Actually , what is destroying the    solution is Palestinian terrorism .
