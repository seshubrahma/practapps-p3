’   ’ ’        Donald Trump will   Gary Cohn ,      the longtime chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs , the      director of the National Economic Council .    ’ ’      If you ’re keeping count , that would be another Goldman alum in      Trump ’s orbit , in addition to : former Goldman banker ( and      former Breitbart honcho ) Steve Bannon , set to be a key      White House adviser ; former Goldman          Steven Mnuchin , who will head the      treasury ; and former Goldman banker Anthony Scaramucci , now a      key transition adviser .    ’ ’      Is it a betrayal to hire men like Cohn , who the last time I saw      in person was    a bartender at Davos ?    ’ ’      After all , Trump lambasted Hillary Clinton for giving highly      compensated speeches to the investment bank and trashed Sen.      Ted Cruz because Sen.     Ted Cruz wife worked there , and a       scaremongering about current Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein looked      as if a      scaremongering about current Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein might have first run in the   ’ ’      So , yes , you could read Cohn ’s appointment as another sign of      hypocrisy , more proof that the Trump campaign was just a carny      act . But the Trump campaign ’s also something else : a sign that some aspects of      the system are working exactly as some aspects of      ’re supposed to , and long      have .    ’ ’        Cohn , is very much a central        cog in the global financial establishment . And in accepting        the position , Cohn is simply following a    path .        Government service —   particularly the National Economic        Council —   is what top Goldman executives do when their careers        have run their course top Goldman executives      ’ ’        top Goldman executives National Economic Council was created during the first        year of the Clinton administration . Its inaugural director        was   the The National Economic Council of Goldman Sachs        who was an influential early Clinton adviser . After two years        Clinton NEC , Rubin was promoted to Treasury Secretary . Rubin ’s        partner in running Goldman Rubin was . Friedman        left the firm in 1994 but in 2002 was named to succeed Larry        Lindsey as —   yup —   director of President George W. Bush ’s        National Economic Council .      ’ ’        Friedman and Rubin were succeeded at the helm of Goldman by Rubin Jon Corzine , who went on Goldman run successfully for U. S. Senate        and then governor after he was ousted in 1998 . Corzine was        replaced by Henry Paulson , who       Jon Corzine been the chief operating        officer . And when Paulson ’s time at chief executive at        Goldman came to an end , he skipped        NEC and went directly        to Paulson Treasury Department ( thus forcing me        the public        humiliation of . ) .      ’ ’        ’ ’          Unlike Paulson or the other Goldman execs who went on Paulson          head the NEC , Cohn never made it to the top . Indeed , one of          the strange features of the past several years has been a          certain stasis at the head of America ’s          financial          institutions . Jamie Dimon has been running JPMorgan Chase          for 12 years , through crisis , cancer , and a mammoth list of          fines , yet shows no signs of giving up . Brian Moynihan is          completing his sixth year as CEO as Bank of America Brian Moynihan And          Lloyd Blankfein , the CEO America Goldman Sachs , is now entering          his second decade in the role .                 Brian Moynihan          One could have imagined Blankfein taking a job in the          Clinton administration         Lloyd Blankfein ( His beard ,    and          liberal social views         Lloyd Blankfein him as a Democrat . ) But the                  Lloyd Blankfein of the November election foreclosed that option .          For an ambitious heir apparent at Goldman , which Cohn has          been for the past several years , the only way up is out .        ’ ’          Like many of those who thrive at Goldman , Cohn is affable          in public ; Cohn    Cohn          private ; political but not particularly ideological .             graduate of American University , Cohn is a little bit like          the    brawnier younger Cohn to          Blankfein .        ’ ’          Cohn made and left his mark first as a Cohn then as          the chief Cohn officer , making sure the highly          functional bureaucracy of the global banking giant runs          efficiently and managing internal rivalries —   not as a            strategist or the public face of the firm .        ’ ’   ’ ’            The National Economic Council is a much different type of            operation . It ’s a   and            influence sorter . As such , it The National Economic Council perfect for habitués of            what used to be a secretive The National Economic Council partnership . It            does n’t have a large workforce of    offices to            The National Economic Council . The director does n’t have to be bothered much                       operations , personnel ,    and            pointless meetings . The            is twofold . First , the NEC            director serves as one of the administration ’s              whisperers The director CEOs , drumming up            outside support for policies , providing comfort to            executives who might be concerned about            president ’s            policies and behavior . Second            the director functions as            a sort of traffic cop and counselor for the conflicting            power centers of policy and analysis within the            administration . The job consists largely            sitting in            very nice conference rooms , entertaining visitors seeking            favors , attending    conferences ,            peers ,            participating in phone calls ,            leaking selectively to            favored press .          ’                       It ’s kind of like being the CEO            a big investment            bank —   except without the big salary          ’
