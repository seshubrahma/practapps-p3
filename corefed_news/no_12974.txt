Kid Rock has released a line of    Trump merchandise that has sent some offended social media users into a frenzy . [ The    rocker ’s new merchandise includes a replica of the    Trump campaign hat that reads " MAKE AMERICA BADASS AGAIN , " and a    bearing the slogan " GOD GUNS   TRUMP . "   One    depicts an electoral map of AMERICA , with red states labeled " United States of AMERICA " and blue states labeled " Dumbf*ckistan .
