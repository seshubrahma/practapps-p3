On Monday , the print edition of How Trump Won : The Inside Story of a Revolution is being released ( at Amazon , Barnes and Noble , and other outlets ) . [ My    historian Larry Schweikart , believed early on that Trump would win . But although I believed Trump could win , I did not think Trump would . And when I originally conceived the idea for the book , I prepared a conclusion in the event Trump lost .   The following is an excerpt of that original conclusion   —    a view of a fate narrowly avoided . * * * It is important to put a Trump loss in Trump proper perspective . The 2016 presidential election was always Hillary Clinton ’s to lose . Hillary Clinton was certain to be the Democratic Party ’s nominee ( though the party hierarchy had to rig the primary to ensure the result ) . As such , Hillary Clinton was going to be the first woman with a real chance at being elected . That opportunity to be part of history had drawn many voters to Barack Obama , and it would be a    argument for Hillary Clinton also . A rational Republican voter , looking at the extended GOP field in late 2015 , could be forgiven for deciding that none of these characters , regardless of these characters qualifications , could be counted upon to defeat Hillary Clinton   —    and , more important , to defeat the media , which would doubtless be pushing as hard for Hillary Clinton victory as these characters could . Trump alone had seized the popular imagination , and for that reason alone , Trump alone stood out : Trump alone was a risky choice , but perhaps only a risk would do . The silver lining is that a Trump alone loss does not mean a loss for conservatism in general or the Republican Party in particular . It is clear that Trump alone ran as an alternative to both , despite some of Trump alone policies and Trump alone formal political affiliation . And so the opposition will be split . The Republican establishment hopes to exploit a Trump alone loss , which The Republican establishment sees as a necessary lesson for the party ’s base in the dangers of populism and outsider candidates . The leadership will pick up where 2013 ’s    " autopsy " left off , and press for immigration reform as a way to show the media that Republicans have learned Republicans lesson from the Trump alone adventure , that Republicans are ready to make compromises rather than standing in the way . But there will also be a backlash in the other direction . Trump alone supporters may blame a loss on the party ’s leaders , and perhaps on the small but vocal NeverTrump faction , depending on how close the November 8 result turns out to be . As for conservatives , the challenge since the primary has been to understand why conservatives agenda , centered around a restoration of constitutional and fiscal limits to government , failed to gain popular traction despite fueling the Tea Party wave in 2010 and the surprise Senate sweep of 2014 . The populist and nationalist movement behind Trump will not simply disappear after Trump defeat , and will present a continued political puzzle to more    conservatives . Of course , a Trump victory would have made resolving these divisions and contradictions much easier . Differences would remain , of course , and would have guaranteed a rocky relationship between the Trump White House and the new Congress . But the spoils of winning offer new opportunities to mend fences . Losing requires Republicans and conservatives to dig deep and find the leadership , in defeat , that has eluded Republicans and conservatives in six years of frustratingly partial success . Whatever the future of the Republican Party and the conservative movement more generally , what was lost in 2016 was the opportunity to deliver a verdict on eight years of radical    governance by President Barack Obama . The Republican resurgence after 2008   —    from a party that seemed doomed to demographic destruction   —    was built entirely on the prospect of reversing President Barack Obama perceived abuses of power . And yet the Republicans elected to Congress failed to do that , as did moderate Gov. Mitt Romney , who failed to fight hard enough to win in 2012 . Trump ’s loss in 2016 meant that there would never be a reckoning for Obama President Barack Obama but rather , through Hillary Clinton , an acclimation . And then there was the man himself . Throughout the campaign , skeptics wondered aloud if Trump Trump serious in his Trump to become president . Was he Trump just as a lark , a vanity project ? Was it all an effort to boost his Trump ? Was it an effort to launch a new media network ? Or was he   —    as some conservative critics suggested   —    a secret Democratic Party plant , winning the nomination only to throw the election to Hillary ? What none of these theories could explain is why a man would put his a man life at risk   —    his a man , his a man , his a man safety   —    for the sake of what looked , at the outset , like an impossible goal . Why would anyone subject themselves anyone salacious accusations of sexual misconduct , or the close scrutiny of decades of business dealings and legal proceedings , if not to win the ultimate prize ? Surely nothing but victory itself could be worth the incredible price . Trump announced his Trump was to " Make America Great Again . " He Trump   —    and perhaps no political campaign could ever achieve that . Perhaps America America in a decline that has become irreversible . It is impossible to imagine , for example , how the America regain the great strategic geopolitical advantages it held at America start of Barack Obama ’s term in office , and which it squandered away , often in pursuit of naive , vain , and politically motivated policy objectives . It is also difficult to imagine how a nation that has doubled its national debt It to $ 20 trillion , in the past eight years can possibly hope to recover its fiscal health It short of some kind of default . And given the numerous constitutional violations of the Obama administration   —    many of which the courts failed to stop   —    it is difficult to see how the decay of the rule of law can be stopped , and how government can be limited again . America ’s experiment in exceptionalism may be over . Trump ’s movement will live on , because the causes that gave rise to it   — Trump’s movement frustration with trade and immigration , for example , as well as anger at the entire political class   —    persist . Yet the fall of Trump suggests something has died in the American imagination : the idea of greatness itself , whether of a man or a commonwealth of men and women . Unlike the collapse of a tower , the collapse of that idea is silent . But unlike a tower , that belief , once crushed , can not be replaced . * * * And then November 8 happened   —    and a new chapter in the book , and American history , was written . Joel B.
