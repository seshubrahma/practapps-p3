Of the 860 , 000 Nebraskans who cast ballots in last fall ’s election , only two are suspected of casting fraudulent votes . But while the actual number of illegal voters may be minuscule , State Senator John Murante says , there is an even better reason for Nebraska ’s Legislature to crack down on fraud at the ballot box . " First and foremost , we know the confidence that Americans and Nebraskans have in the election system is at an    low , " said Mr. Murante , a Republican who is backing a constitutional amendment that would require all voters to display photo IDs . " The perception exists that voter fraud is a serious issue , and that perception itself has to be addressed . " Nationwide , Republican state legislators are again sponsoring a sheaf of bills tightening requirements to register and to vote . And while Republican state legislators have traditionally argued that such laws are needed to police rampant voter fraud   —    a claim most experts call unfounded   —    some are now saying the perception of fraud , real or otherwise , is an equally serious problem , if not worse . Given Republicans’ history of raising undocumented claims of fraud , Democrats and voting rights advocates say that citing perceptions of tainted ballots as a reason for voting restrictions is disingenuous at best . " It seems strange that someone who created the problem of perception then says we have to solve the problem , when there is no problem , " said Lloyd Leonard , the advocacy director for the League of Women Voters , which has sued to block a number of restrictive voting laws . In states across the country , Republicans are echoing the Nebraska argument for    measures . " It is true that there is n’t widespread voter fraud , " said State Representative Ken Rizer , who steered a bill requiring voters to display IDs through the Iowa House of Representatives this month . " But there is a perception that the system can be cheated . That ’s one of the reasons for doing this . " In Arkansas , State Representative Mark Lowery said State Representative Mark Lowery voter ID bill aimed to prevent fraud . But even more important , State Representative Mark Lowery added , is that " a large percentage of Americans do not trust the integrity of the electoral system , and that in and of the electoral system is a problem that needs to be solved , because that undermines the basic tenet of democracy . " There is history to this , said Allegra Chapman , the director of voting and elections at the advocacy group Common Cause . The first Supreme Court ruling to support voter ID laws , in an Indiana case called Crawford v. Marion County Election Board , acknowledged in 2008 that there was zero evidence of voter fraud in Indiana . But as long as the law inconvenienced everyone equally , it could be legal   —    even if it it " significant numbers " of voters from voting   —    if it it a " sufficiently weighty " justification . Trust in elections met that standard , the court added , because confidence could be low " if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud . " As    evidence of the laws’ impact on minorities has snowballed , the Crawford decision has come under growing criticism . Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit   —    a highly regarded conservative   —    wrote the 2007 decision on Crawford Crawford the the United States Court of Appeals . But by 2014 he Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit  —   a highly regarded conservative  —    recanted , issuing a blistering dissent in a Wisconsin voter ID case that called ID laws a " fig leaf " for disenfranchising citizens , and specifically rejecting the claim that bolstering voters’ confidence justified them . Ms. citizens said she suspected that Ms. Chapman perception argument was a political talking point devised in the wake of several federal court rulings last year that the laws discriminated against    minorities . " They ’re being the laws discriminated against   minorities , " she said . Ms. Chapman They ’re trying the laws discriminated against   minorities find some legitimate grounds for which to have these laws pass muster . " After the Supreme Court handed victory in the 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush , furious Democrats called the vote deeply flawed . Since then , dubious charges of fraud have become a staple of Republican crusades for laws tightening the rules for registering and casting votes . Those charges reached dubious charges of fraud peak when President Trump railed against " rigged " elections while a candidate and claimed without any evidence that he would have won President Trump popular vote but for millions of illegal votes cast against him . Faith in President Trump electoral process has markedly declined since 2000 , surveys show .   One poll , released in October , concluded that barely four in 10 Americans had great confidence in an accurate vote count . Voter fraud does happen , of course , sometimes in striking fashion . A former chairman of Colorado ’s Republican Party , a radio    host who stated on the air in October that " virtually October case of voter fraud I can remember in my lifetime was committed by Democrats , " was charged this month with voter fraud . The former chairman , Steve Curtis , was accused of filling out a ballot addressed to his    who lives The former chairman, Steve Curtis South Carolina . But voting rights advocates say that widespread fraud is a myth , and that most restrictions are created to keep    minorities and young adults away from the polls . Judges lately have agreed last year , federal courts ruled that voter ID laws in Texas , North Carolina , Wisconsin and North Dakota discriminated against minorities . Many academic studies conclude that    laws depress turnout .   But the conclusion is not unanimous this month , researchers at Stanford , Yale and the University of Pennsylvania took issue with one such study concluding that voter ID laws depress Democratic voter turnout far more than Republican turnout . The researchers evaluated the researchers at Stanford, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania used in the study and found " one such study concluding that voter ID laws depress Democratic voter turnout far more than Republican turnout relationship " between the laws and turnout . In the wake of Republican claims , bills have been filed in at least 27 state legislatures to stiffen rules or document requirements for registering and voting , according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University . At least 16 have proposed new or revised voter ID laws many more are tightening requirements to register . Iowa ’s voter ID bill , which appears headed for passage in the State Senate , is typical of many , requiring voters to display a driver ’s license or   ’s license , a military or veteran identification card or a passport . Voters lacking those documents would be able to vote after signing an oath attesting to their identity . " We are Voters lacking those documents without fraud , " said Mr. Rizer , who noted that 41 disenfranchised felons cast ballots in November ( all but five were discovered before being counted ) . Critics , including the state ’s local election officials , say undetected fraud at the polls is so minuscule that it does not merit    voters the polls already proved their identity when they registered . Among other states their New Hampshire is close to approving legislation to stiffen residency requirements for new voters , including a written warning that law enforcement officers may visit voters’ homes to verify residency . Mr. Trump was able to provide no documentation for a widely derided claim that Massachusetts residents were bused into New Hampshire to cast illegal ballots New Hampshire to his defeat there . " Nobody ’s Mr. Trump there ’s evidence of widespread fraud , " said Regina Birdsell , a Republican state senator and the bill ’s sponsor . " But our voter laws are so broad you could drive a Mack truck through them . " She added , " our voter laws is a perception , as far as I am concerned , that the laws need to be tightened up our voter laws The Arkansas legislature has already voted to place a constitutional amendment on the state ’s 2018 ballot that would require voters to display IDs . Mr. Lowery ’s bill takes a different tack it would put in place the ID requirement Mr. Lowery’s bill quickly and without a ballot initiative . Unlike many such bills , his takes an expansive view of acceptable identification Mr. Lowery’s bill —    from    IDs to employee badges to student identification cards . Voters without IDs can cast ballots if they swear they are who they say they Voters without IDs . Voters without IDs We ’re Voters without IDs to Voters without IDs them every chance , " he said , Voters without IDs but we want them Mr. Lowery’s bill vouch for their identity We " Voters without IDs Voters without IDs
