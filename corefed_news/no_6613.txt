Sunday on CNN during the opening of a segment featuring Breitbart senior     Joel Pollak on " Reliable Sources , " the network misidentified former Breitbart News report Julia Hahn , who last week it was announced took a job at the Trump White House as a special assistant to the president .   Host Brian Stelter was pointing out that Breitbart News , which Host Brian Stelter said had been considered to be an outlet on the outside looking in , now had an insider â€™s perspective with the roles that Hahn , former Breitbart senior national security editor Sebastian Gorka and White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon have in the Trump administration . However , instead of using a photo of Hahn , CNN used the photo of another Julia Hahn who is a German television personality . The same mistake had been made by other outlets as well , including Salon . Follow Breitbart News on Twitter @BreitbartNews
