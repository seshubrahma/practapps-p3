’   ’ ’ Paul Schrader has spent Paul Schrader career delving into the dark side    of the human condition . ’ ’ Starting out as a screenwriter , Paul Schrader instantly became a star by    writing Martin Scorsese’ ’s 1976 classic " Taxi Driver . " That    started a long collaboration with Scorsese , continuing with    " Raging Bull , " " The Last Temptation of Christ , " and " Bringing Out    the Dead . " ’ ’ Schrader has tested audiences even more as a director , making    haunting dramas like " American Gigolo " ; the 1980s " Cat People "    remake ; " Affliction " ; and " The Canyons , " which is known   than what’ ’s    on screen . ( ’ ’ Schrader said ’ ’ Schrader isn’’t mad   —    the movie sold for more    than it cost to make . ) ’ ’ For his latest movie , " Dog Eat Dog , " which opens in theaters    November 4 and is on video on demand on November 11 , Schrader    teamed with Nicolas Cage and Willem Dafoe to create a bizarre ,    ultraviolent dark comedy   —    extremely dark and extremely violent   —      that is perhaps the boldest work Schrader    has ever done . ’ " Business Insider had a candid conversation with Schrader    about the current movie business , how Cage Nicolas Cage him ’ " Business Insider the    actor suddenly read his the   actor imitating Humphrey Bogart , and why    he the   actor never watch a     cut of a Scorsese    movie . " " Jason Guerrasio : You ’ve said while doing press       this movie that you had final cut on it this movie At this point in       career , can you make a movie any other way ? " ’Paul Schrader : I never had final cut earlier on       my career , and I never needed it final cut you were always       movies with people who like movies and who understood    movies . And yes , you had disagreements , and yes , you went back       forth , but at the end of the day you would come to an       . ’ "    Now in the last 10 years or so , we have started to see this    influx of money into the entertainment business from people who    do n’t necessarily like movies , watch movies , or know movies . You       find yourself in a room with people who are financing the    film who do n’t watch movies themselves . Once you start to realize       you could be dealing with folks like that , then you start to       how can I protect myself yourself These people have a formula in    their These people that is based on another time and place , and it ’s not       time and place in which you ’re making your movie . " ’Guerrasio : So you take a read on the people    involved and decide if you say you want final cut ? ’ ’Schrader : You try to . Every artist will tell you       : Every time you get      you say , " I’’m never going to get        that way again . " And you don’’t . But they come up with a    new way to      you . ’ ’   ’ ’Guerrasio : One of the things that is embedded in    my brain about your movie is Nicolas Cage impersonating Humphrey    Bogart by the end of the your movie Was that written in the script ? ’ ’Schrader : That was not in the book . ( The    your movie based on a book of the same title by Edward    Bunker . ) That was not in the script . The the script the script    were not comic either . ’ "    But Nic had this idea for his character who thought himself Nic somewhat foolishly as Nic Bogart , so he was doing Bogart    Nic , which I was n’t that crazy about , but I was n’t going to    pick a fight over    . I could always    it out . " ’ a fight over it But there was this whole nagging issue of the last scene . We had    talked about it in    , but this whole nagging issue of the last scene wasn’’t really satisfied .       came back to       while we were shooting and he We , " I    don’’t get this last scene . I don’’t understand why he’ ’s   don’’t    alive . I don’’t    what he’ ’s   don’’t with this he’    couple . " And I said , " Well , maybe he’ ’s not still alive he’ Maybe    it’ ’s the afterlife . " And that’ ’s when he started to come up he’    the Bogart idea .    ’    He said , " Well he’ I’’ve been fooling around with Bogart . If he is Bogart actually dead he’ then he can become Bogart and he’ can save Bogart    he’ couple . this black   couple pull that he’ , but that’ ’s how    that evolved . ’ that’    And he kind of stunned this he’ me on the day we he’ shooting    that . We went through it and all of a we he’ ’s doing it as    Bogie and I was like it " Whoa , you sure you want to do that ? " And    he said , " Look , you’’ve       me for five weeks that we    have to be bold . This we    only way you can do this genre    today . " He said , " I think this is    bold choice . " I said , " Yeah ,    I think it is , too . Let’ ’s do this . " ’ ’   ’ " this : For a movie that I think was intended    to shock , it ’s not the    that stays with      —    it ’s the    ending . " ’Schrader    Yeah , we jump into a meta movie . But    my feeling is how you deal with    crime film in 2016 is a jazz    riff . You try to stay ahead of the viewer . You don’’t quite know    where you’’re going , and so one    the things that’ ’s unique about    " Dog Eat Dog " is that it’ ’s a genre Dog predictability . The    three    doing their last job , etc .    ’s a lot of genre    tropes in there . On the other hand , it’ ’s an unpredictable take on    a it’ genre . ’ ’Guerrasio :    Cage still a bankable star so that    when he’ ’s attached you have a    go " picture ? ’ " Schrader : Nic gets your movie financed . That ’s    the good news . The bad news is that he eats up the good news    budget in the process of getting it financed because you end up    basically paying him the good news budget . But he still commands those big he numbers . " " he I mean , the distributor of this film told me that all of the work    we have done   —    the film festivals , all the press , the public    appearances , the theatrical release   —    it all has one goal , which    is to be No . 1 VOD on the first VOD weekend , because there is so    much product out there on demand that if you ’re not in the top    five it does n’t matter anymore because people ca n’t get through    it all . So you got to try to be No . 1 on VOD release . " " Guerrasio : But do you ever see what those    engagement numbers really are ? Will the film ’s distributor , RLJ    Entertainment , disclose them to you and be transparent ? " ’Schrader : those   engagement numbers talked to RLJ about this . We’’ll see    how transparent they RLJ   Entertainment . They promise to be transparent . I those   engagement numbers    " those   engagement numbers Canyons " a while back and we    that for a      dollars and then we sold it to IFC for $ 1 million , we so    all made money and it was all fun and dandy . But of course ,    at the end , that film could go on and make money for the next 20    years [ through streaming ] and we’’ll never see a statement . ’ ’   ’ ’Guerrasio : And   —    one way to stretch a dollar for    this movie   —    you yourself played one of the characters . Which was    something done at the last second , right ? ’ ’Schrader : Yeah , Marty [ Scorsese ] was going to do    it , and then the date we wanted him fell    his birthday , and he    didn’’t Marty [Scorsese] to come Marty [Scorsese] I remember saying Marty [Scorsese] the producer , " Even if    Marty had come , we don’’t even have enough Marty [Scorsese] airfare    anymore . we Because this was at the Marty [Scorsese] of the shooting schedule .    So then there was the option of hiring a local , and I didn’’t want    to do that , and Cage Nicolas Cage pressuring me to    the role myself . And    I thought , I may be bad , but I    be boring . ’ ’Guerrasio : But you also asked Quentin Tarantino ,    ’ ’Guerrasio , and Christopher Walken , right ? ’ ’Schrader : Yeah . ’ ’Schrader Everett to    do it as a transgender Cleveland gangster , and he was willing to    do it Rupert Everett but then his Oscar Wilde project [ Rupert Everett The Happy    " ] Rupert Everett intervened . ’ Rupert Everett : I’’ve heard you say in the past that    your films I’’ve not " exorcise " them . ’ " Schrader :    every one . But that ’s one of your films      things they can do , yes . " ’Guerrasio : Is that still the case today ? ’ " Schrader ’Paul Schrader You need to have a film like that    maybe every four or five years . I do n’t think every film can be    like that . " ’Guerrasio : So when was the last one like that    for you ? ’ ’Schrader : Well , that’ ’s this ’ ’Schrader a    film called " , " that’ I also directed and it started Nic Nicolas Cage And    when I handed in the director’ ’s cut that’ they took it away . ’ ’Guerrasio : So getting screwed over again . ’ ’Schrader : that’ , there was a point I wanted to ’ ’Schrader with this movie   —    I wanted to make a point that I can make a    film with Nic Cage Nicolas Cage want to see . ’ ’   ’ ’Guerrasio : You mentioned " The    , " a movie    that is known more for   while making the movie . Was    that a rebound moment for you , making that movie ? ’ ’Schrader : It wasn’’t much of a rebound ; it was an    ’ ’Schrader exhausting , ’ ’Schrader the movie a lot of sanctimonious ’ ’Schrader at poor Lindsay from the media . " Bad girl , bad    There’ . " It’ ’s like all these people wagging their finger at Donald    Trump while selling publications . ’ " Guerrasio it’ So the media played up incidents in    the making of all these people movie that did n’t define how that movie was    made ? " ’Schrader the media .   was there on the set every day , so all    that stuff the movie not very flattering    it was true . Maybe some    of it a little exaggerated , but most of it true . But every film    is a drama for a different reason . ’ ’Guerrasio    Have    seen Scorsese’ ’s      " Silence "    ? ’ " Schrader : No . He ’s really hit ’ ’Guerrasio    because they ’ll be mixing all next month and it opens in December    and it ’s three and a half Schrader: long . I see Marty a lot the mattresses    but I    would never want to    in that position to be    early viewer of    Marty of his films . " " Guerrasio : So even in    past , he does n’t call    on you ? " ’Schrader : No    I would    uncomfortable . ’ ’ ’
