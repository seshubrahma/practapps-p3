Look , when a nominee does n’t get 60 votes , you should n’t change the rules , you should change a nominee . And let ’s a nominee take , give me one minute here , because this is important , let ’s a nominee look at the history , okay ? "   " Our a nominee Merrick Garland , Mitch McConnell broke 230 years of precedent and did n’t call him up Mitch McConnell a vote , " he continued Mitch McConnell " It was n’t in the middle of an election campaign , it was It . Second , then now it looks like we have the votes to prevent Gorsuch from getting on . Now that does n’t mean you have to change the rules . Each side did n’t get their nominee Each side Let ’s sit down and come together . Our Republican friends are acting like , you know , they ’re Our Republican friends cat on the top of a tree and they have Our Republican friends jump off with all the damage that entails .
