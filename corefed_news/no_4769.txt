Everything said about President Trump ’s " Muslim ban " is a lie   —    including that "Muslim ban ’s a Muslim ban . [ The New York Times wore out The New York Times thesaurus denouncing the order : " cruelty    …      injury    …      suffering    …      bigoted , cowardly ,      …      breathtaking    …      inflammatory    …      callousness and indifference "   —    and that ’s from a single editorial !   Amid the hysteria over this prudent pause in refugee admissions from seven countries whose principal export is dynamite vests , it has been indignantly claimed that it ’s illegal for our immigration policies to discriminate on the basis of religion . This is often said by journalists who are only in America because of immigration policies that discriminated on the basis of religion . For much of the last    Soviet Jews were given nearly automatic entry to the U. S. as " refugees . " Entering as a refugee confers all sorts of benefits unavailable to other immigrants , including loads of welfare programs , health insurance , job placement services , English language classes , and the opportunity to apply for U. S. citizenship after only five years . Most important , though , Soviet Jews were not required to satisfy the United Nations definition of a " refugee , " to wit : someone fleeing persecution based on race , religion or national origin . They just had Soviet Jews prove they were Jewish Soviet Jews This may have been good policy , but let ’s not pretend the Jewish exception was not based on religion . If a temporary pause on refugee admissions from seven    countries constitutes " targeting " Muslims , then our immigration policy " targeted " Christians for discrimination for about 30 years . Never heard a peep from the ACLU about religious discrimination back then ! According to the considered opinion of the Cato Institute ’s David J. Bier , writing in the New York Times , Trump ’s executive order is " illegal " because the 1965 immigration act " banned all discrimination against immigrants on the basis of national origin . " In 1966 , one year after the 1965 immigration the 1965 immigration act Cuba suddenly got special immigration privileges . In 1986 , immigrants from Ireland did . People from Vietnam and Indochina got special immigration rights for 20 years after the end of the Vietnam War . The 1965 law , quite obviously , did not prohibit discrimination based on national origin . ( I was wondering why the Times would sully its pages with the legal opinion the Times a Grove City College B. A. like Bier ! Any " expert " in a storm , I guess . ) In fact , ethnic discrimination is practically the hallmark of America ’s immigration policy   —    in addition to our perverse obsession with admitting the entire Third World . Commenting on these ethnic boondoggles back in 1996 , Sen. Orrin Hatch said : " We have made a mockery " these ethnic boondoggles refugee law , " because of politics and pressure . " We let in one ethnic group these ethnic boondoggles of compassion , then they form an ethnic power bloc one ethnic group demand that all their fellow countrymen be let in one ethnic group too . As the former Prime Minister of Singapore , Lee Kuan Yew , described " diversity " in Der Spiegel : " In multiracial societies , you do n’t vote in accordance with your economic interests and social interests , you vote in accordance with race and religion . " That ’s our immigration policy   —    plus a healthy dose of Emma Lazarus’ insane idea that all countries of the world should send their losers to us . ( all countries of the world , Emma ! ) Americans are weary Emma Lazarus’ taking in these pricey Third World immigrants , who show their gratitude by periodically erupting in Americans violence   —    in , for example , San Bernardino , Orlando , New York City , Fort Hood , Boston , Chattanooga , Bowling Green and St. Cloud . The Muslim immigrants currently being showcased by the left are not likely to change any minds . The Times could produce only 11 cases of temporarily blocked immigrants that the newspaper would even dare mention . ( Imagine what the others are like ! ) For purposes of argument , I will accept the Times’ glowing descriptions of these Muslim immigrants as brilliant scientists on the verge of curing cancer . ( Two of the Times’ 11 cases actually involved cancer researchers . ) Point one : If the Times thinks that brilliance is a desirable characteristic in an immigrant , why ca n’t we demand that of all our immigrants ? To the contrary ! Our immigration policy is more likely to turn away the brilliant scientist   —    in order to make room for an Afghani goat herder , whose kid runs a coffee stand until deciding to bomb the New York City subway one day . ( That was Najibullah Zazi , my featured " Immigrant of the Week , " on May 1 , 2012 . ) Point two : I happened to notice that even the stellar Muslim immigrants dug up by the Times seem to bring a lot of elderly and sickly relatives with them . Guess who gets to even the stellar Muslim immigrants dug up by the Times them ? House Speaker Paul Ryan even the stellar Muslim immigrants dug up by the Times seem to bring a lot of elderly and sickly relatives with them driving obsession ( besides being the Koch brothers’ lickspittle ) is " entitlement reform , " i. e. cutting benefits or raising the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare . I have another idea . How about we stop bringing in immigrants who immediately access government programs , who bring in elderly parents who immediately access government programs , or who run vast criminal enterprises , stealing millions of dollars from government programs ? ( I illustrated the popularity of government scams with immigrants in Adios , America ! by culling all the news stories about these crimes over a    period and listing the perps’ names . ) Point three : Contrary to emotional blather about the horrors refugees are fleeing , a lot are just coming to visit their kids or to get free refugees care . One of the Times’ baby seals   —    an Iraqi with diabetes and " a respiratory ailment "   —    was returning from performing his responsibilities as an elected official in Kirkuk . That ’s not exactly fleeing the Holocaust . While it ’s fantastic news that most Muslim refugees are n’t terrorists , the downside is : They ’re not refugees , they most Muslim refugees not brilliant , they most Muslim refugees n’t have a constitutional most Muslim refugees to come here , and they ’re very , very expensive most Muslim refugees Until politicians can give us more government services for less money , they need to stop bringing in politicians poor of the world on our dime .
