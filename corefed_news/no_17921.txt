’   ’ ’    Two memos released by the Department of Homeland Security on    Tuesday   for the implementation of    two executive orders President Donald Trump signed in January . ’ ’    The memos detail the increased authority federal officials will    have to detain and deport immigrants in the US illegally . ’ ’    They also expand the pool of unauthorized immigrants subject to    " "   —    that is , removal that    bypasses court proceedings   —    and describe the resources that will    be provided to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and    Customs and Border protection agencies in order to fulfill the    directives . ’ ’    Also within the memos are   that seem likely to infuriate   —      and may well overwhelm   —    Mexican authorities . ’ ’    Section H of the memo , titled " Implementing the President’ ’s    Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements    Policies , " details policies meant to streamline the deportation    process for US authorities and to better use the resources    required . ’ ’    Provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act authorize the    Homeland Security Department " to return aliens arriving on land    from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States , to the    territory from which they arrived , pending a formal removal    proceeding , " the memo . ’ ’    " When aliens so apprehended do not pose a risk of a subsequent    illegal entry or attempted illegal entry , returning them to aliens    foreign contiguous territory from which they arrived aliens pending the    outcome of removal proceedings saves the Department’ ’s detention    and adjudication resources for other priority aliens , " it    . ’ ’   ’ ’    As detailed   which reported the contents of    the    on Monday , these provisions would mean many immigrants    not originally from Mexico   —    Guatemalans , Honduras , Salvadorans ,    or Haitians , among others   —    would still be put in the hands of    Mexican authorities , who would have to decide their next steps . ’ "    Many of those migrants have previously been detained in the US ,    where they are those migrants to apply for asylum . Under Trump ’s plan ,    they       to do so from Mexico , communicating with US    immigration officials by videoconference , presumably using    facilities    Mexican government would have to provide . " ’    " This would say if you want to make a claim for asylum or    whatever we ’ll hear your case but you are going to wait in    Mexico , Mexico a DHS official   ProPublica . " Those are details that are    being worked out both within the department and between the US    government and the government of Mexico      Mexico there are elements that    still need to be worked out in detail . " ’ ’    Mike Vigil , a former chief of international operations for the US    Drug Enforcement Administration who maintains contact with    Mexican officials , said authorities there were aware the US    intended to do something like this   —    and they were not authorities on    it .    ’   ’ ’    Mexican officials are " of the opinion that Trump also wants to    send individuals that were born Central American through Mexico ,    and they    that ’ ’  ’ ’   Mexican officials "   . ’ ’    " They want the ’ ’  ’ ’   Mexican officials States to fly them or do ’ ’  ’ ’   Mexican officials they have    ’ ’  ’ ’   Mexican officials do , but they don’’t want ’ ’  ’ ’   Mexican officials going into ’ ’  ’ ’   Mexican officials through Mexico , " Mexico said Vigil    author of " . " ’ ’    The burden Trump   —    who has   of much of Mexican society   —      apparently wants to foist on Mexico in the Mexico of foreign    deportees has attracted indignation from the government and    public alike . ’ "    But the plan poses the additional risk of sapping Mexico ’s    Mexico resources and recreating the very problems that inspired    Trump ’s harsh crackdown . " ’    " The addition of millions of unemployed people to economies that    are already struggling would only multiply desperation and    violence in    and Central Mexico , where security , justice ,    and    institutions are already overwhelmed , " Adam    Isacson , the senior associate for defense oversight at the    Washington Office on Latin America , . ’ ’    " There would probably be chaos , " Isacson said . " And the desire to    escape chaos would spur more migration northward . " ’ ’   ’ ’    The US has undertaken    deportations of people to    Mexico and Central America in the past . Such policies in the     migrants back to places like Honduras and El    Salvador   —    economically and politically fragile countries where    they had no real roots . They soon became they for gangs like    Barrio 18 and   . ’ ’    The     in recent years has been driven north by violence and instability     —    fostered in large part by those gangs   —    that is still present    in the region . Their presence in those gangs   has already taxed the    resources of the government there . ’ ’    Just as those deportees were vulnerable to criminal groups in    northern Central America , waves of deportees returning to Mexico     that Mexico have proliferated in that country , Mexico exploitation ,    extortion , or    . ’ ’    Despite the stricter border policies Trump has promised , many of    those deported ,    matter their country of origin , would likely    look to return    the US . ’ ’   ’ ’    " To the big wave of economic migrants would be more people    fleeing violence , along with many thousands of husbands , wives ,    and parents who got separated from their loved ones by Trump’ ’s    deportation raids , " . ’ ’    A Homeland Security official   ProPublica that the provisions cited the    memo had been in place for years , and that the department was    just pursuing its mandate . ’ the department    But those policies , and the justification for them , are unlikely    to sway Mexican authorities . ’ ’    " I would expect Mexico to respond with an emphatic , ’’ No , ’’ "    Gustavo Mohar , a former senior Mexican immigration and       official ,   ProPublica . ’ ’Two memos released by the Department of . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
