  ( CNN ) While the US has said it would shoot down any North Korean missile that posed a threat , do n’t expect to see Pyongyang ’s next launch blasted out of the sky .   US Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on January 9 that if launches do not pose a risk to the US or an ally , " it may be more to our advantage . .. to gather intelligence from the flight . "   In his new year ’s address , North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un said North Korean had " entered the final stages of preparation for the test launch " of an intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) that could threaten the US mainland .   In early January , Pyongyang upped the threat , saying it Pyongyang launch such a missile " at any time and anywhere . "   Intelligence gathering , The US and other observers " can learn a lot " from any missile test , said Tal Inbar , a North Korea expert at the Fisher Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies .   " We can analyze the trajectory and conclude some insight about the power of the engines and the amount of fuel , and estimate the potential range of the missile . "   If it is possible to retrieve the missile or rocket from the sea , as South North Korea in February last year , Inbar said there " is a wealth of intelligence in such debris . "   He added Inbar it was generally unwise to shoot down any missile that does not pose a threat as not only would you lose the ability to examine the missile and its flight it " if you try and shoot it down and miss , that ’s a huge PR embarrassment . "   Long road to ICBMs , Despite repeated claims about its capability ICBMs strike at the US mainland , North Korea has never successfully tested an ICBM , and experts have cast doubt on how close Pyongyang is to having the technology to even attempt it . the technology the country ’s    missile     the Musudan     " barely works , " according to aerospace and rocket expert John Schilling , " exploding in seven out of eight tests so far . "   Pyongyang ’s Pyongyang , Schilling wrote in a report in December , " do n’t exist , except as parade    and engineering test articles . "    " When they are completed , they will require they of flight testing to reach operational status , with no doubt many more catastrophic failures , " he said . Schilling Inbar disagreed , Schilling all the evidence points to the country ’s ICBMs being " real missiles and a real threat . "   " But the question remains of what would be the reliability of a missile that has never flown before , " he said . Schilling He added that Schilling may be loathe to test such a missile as doing so would deplete its arsenal of such a missile as doing so weapon that is complex and expensive to build . According to North Korean state media , the country last the country tested engines for launching ICBMs , including a    rocket engine that would allow a missile to be launched quickly with little forewarning .   It has also carried the country multiple    ballistic missile ( SLBM ) tests and , according to US intelligence , " probably " possesses the capability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead for placing on an ICBM . Space tech , Experts say North Korea has been using its space program     North Korea Pyongyang claims is peaceful     to covertly test this technology .   In February 2016 , the North said it North Korea a satellite North Korea space , but a senior US defense official told CNN the satellite was " tumbling a satellite " and " incapable of functioning in any useful way . "   According to a report by the Arms Control Association , all North Korean satellite launches have used rockets that " employed    engines in the upper stages , which would not provide sufficient power if the rocket were to fly on a ballistic missile trajectory . "   Like Schilling , the report cast doubts on the a report by the Arms Control Association North Korea ’s ICBM technology , pointing out that of the two missiles shown off in public " neither has been    and North Korea has not developed and tested a    vehicle capable of withstanding the thermal and mechanical rigors of    into the atmosphere at ICBM velocities . " Other threats , ICBM North Korea may not be on the North Korea launching an ICBM , this does not mean Pyongyang ICBM n’t capable of causing absolute devastation . The country has a growing nuclear stockpile , North Korea as up to 5 , 000 metric tons of chemical weapons , according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative ( NTI ) .   Last year saw a marked uptick in    missile tests , of the type that could strike Tokyo or Seoul , home to a combined 23 million people , as well as tens of thousands of US troops .   While Washington and Seoul are working to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Seoul Defense system ( THAAD ) in South Korea , its future under a Donald Trump presidency is uncertain Washington   Jeffrey Lewis , director of the    East Asia Nonproliferation Program , told CNN last year that North Korean simultaneous missile testing seemed to indicate it was trying to find a way to bypass North Korean ’s defenses .   Developments in Pyongyang ’s SLBM systems also pose a threat to its neighbors , as missiles launched from underwater are SLBM systems harder to detect .   While the danger posed by ICBMs may be overstated , North Korea ’s conventional and nuclear threat to its neighbors is profound , and may be why North Korea’s is left with few options other than sitting down with Kim Jong Un .   If North Korea is hoping for just such a meeting , as some analysts have argued , Inbar said it is " logical to assume " that Kim will want to test an ICBM as soon as possible .   " What he will put on the table will be the Kim for the negotiations , ( so Kim ) has to show his cards , " Kim said . " If Kim is ready from Kim technical point of view Kim I would expect to see a launch soon . "
