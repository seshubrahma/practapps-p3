TEL AVIV   —    With the allegations of    against Steve Bannon quickly collapsing , the    Jewish Forward newspaper has trotted out a creative new smear : Steve Bannon is an    who loves the Jewish state . [ The Forward is a progressive Jewish newspaper that brandishes its democratic socialist roots .   The Forward on Tuesday featured an unhinged piece titled , " How Steve Bannon and Breitbart News Can Be     —    and    at the Same Time . " the   Jewish Forward newspaper was attempting to perpetuate    claims against Steve Bannon in light of evidence that Steve Bannon a staunch supporter of Israel and the Jewish people . Breitbart Steve Bannon and Breitbart News former executive chairman was named by    Donald Trump earlier this week as the chief strategist to the new White House administration . To keep the smear going , the Forward contended : " Yet though it would seem impossible to hate Jews but love the Jewish state , these two viewpoints are not as contradictory as they these two viewpoints . " The newspaper ’s    evidence for this seemingly contradictory phenomenon consisted largely of quoting two professors who claim without offering any actual proof that    can support the the Jewish state The the Forward : There is actually " little correlation " between    and    according to Steven M. Cohen , a sociologist at the Hebrew Union    Institute of Religion . To be sure ,    is found among       left . But it is also found    the Zionist right . " Many people who dislike Jews like Israel and many people who are critical toward Israel are affectionate toward Israel , " said Cohen .    …      This duality is a central component of " Trumpism , " said Yael Sternhell , a Tel Aviv University professor of history and American studies .

He also has a Trump     and a daughter who converted to Judaism . At the same time , many of Trump ’s followers spout Trump . " As long as Jews are in Israel fighting the ‘ Israel fight’ with the Arab world as a bastion of American ideals and values in the Middle East , then they are very useful and admirable allies , " said Sternhell . " Once they are home demanding they multicultural democracy , demanding that the country accommodate their Israel their belief they their custom they that is they different story . " The Forward also offered as " evidence " baseless claims that Breitbart is a place where "   and Zionism go hand in hand , " and that "   attitudes abound in Poland , for example , even as Poland has a strong diplomatic Poland with Israel .
