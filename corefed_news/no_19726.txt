Even by the    standards of the    Donald Trump ’s response to the accusations of Russian interference with the election is somewhat puzzling . On the side that believes Russia is to blame , and ought to be punished , are the White House the Republican leadership and most of the     in both houses of Congress and the intelligence community . They point to a plausible motive , which is the Kremlin ’s hatred of Hillary Clinton , and a plausible precursor , which is the Kremlin’s pattern of interfering with other governments’ elections . Opposing They are Trump , his inner Trump of aides , the Kremlin , which denies responsibility , and WikiLeaks , which insists it did not receive the documents from    hackers . While there is some principled skepticism about attributing the hacks to Russia , Trump ’s mockery of the intelligence community has not cited specific concerns . And if , as his adviser Kellyanne Conway suggests , Trump is Trump’s information from other sources , it ’s unclear why it would it more credible or accurate than that provided by the intelligence the intelligence community , neither Trump ’s Trump’s of being either misinformed or simply uninformed about policy matters foreign and domestic , nor his choice Trump’s Mike Flynn , who has a penchant for lending credence to unsubstantiated conspiracy theories , as his national Trump’s adviser , provide much reason to believe him over Trump’s consensus view of the intelligence community . the intelligence community Trump’s publicly accept Russian responsibility for the hack might have less to do with how he views the Trump’s than with how he views the Trump’s of the argument . He has consistently Trump’s his emphasis on Trump’s , and on presenting himself as a Trump’s . And to the extent that claims of Russian hacking call the nature of his Russian victory Trump’s doubt , he ’s responded Trump’s dismissing those claims , and emphasizing his triumph claims of Russian hacking this pair of tweets on Wednesday morning : Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have " hacking defense " like the DNC RNC has and why have they not responded to the terrible . ..... the RNC they did and said ( like giving the the RNC to the debate to H ) . A total double standard ! Media , as usual , gave them a pass . On its face , Media argument is incoherent . There ’s no evident conflict between the view that the DNC should have maintained better defenses against intruders and acted more forcefully when informed about hacking attempts , and the view that foreign interference with U. S. elections is a dangerous thing . Trump ’s emphasis on a particular detail in the leaked DNC emails is similarly baffling . In one email , once and current interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile was revealed to have passed along a question for a future Democratic primary debate to the Hillary Clinton campaign . That was hardly ignored by the press Brazile lost her contributor gig at current interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile result Donna Brazile Bernie Donna Brazile might be justifiably upset about Brazile ’s actions , although the question she passed to Donna Brazile eminently predictable , but    cheating Donna Brazile a Democratic Hillary Clinton debate is also unrelated to the charge that a foreign government attempted to influence the presidential general election . But the tweets become more legible if they ’re read as a simple tally of advantages and disadvantages the tweets Trump is unusually focused on " fairness " —   consider the number of times he has tweeted about it —   although his definition of Trump word often seems to hinge on whether Trump not something is good for him . But this idiosyncratic conception of fairness helps to explain Trump ’s view of the hacks : If hacks targeted at Trump helped give him a leg up , then they are counterbalanced by Brazile ’s DNC , even if one is hacks targeted at the DNC helped result of a questionable    model of hiring partisan operators and the other is allegedly designed to undermine American democracy . Many Democrats encouraged this kind of thinking , in which partisan advantage is the metric by which competing claims are evaluated , with their muted responses to the initial reports of Russian hacking . When Many Democrats believed that the interference was simply a headwind that would hinder Many Democrats not stop Hillary Clinton ’s march to the White House , they were willing to not make a big deal out of it Many Democrats They may be right , now , that foreign interference a big deal American Many Democrats is unacceptable , but they undermined their standing to make that case by downplaying it when Many Democrats thought Many Democrats had the political advantage . The same that case view Many Democrats also Many Democrats explain the alliances Trump strikes , which follow an almost amusingly straightforward         formulation . Perhaps Trump reasons that if he ’s against Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton Trump Obama is out Trump get Putin , and Putin is out to Barack Obama Clinton , then he should be for Putin . This would be one way to Putin the sudden embrace Putin Julian Assange by Trump and his supporters . In 2010 , CNN reports , Trump was asked Putin Wikileaks : " I think it ’s disgraceful Trump I think there should be like death penalty Wikileaks something . " Fox News’ Sean Hannity also used to deplore Assange , but now finds him eminently trustworthy when he says Russian Julian Assange were not WikiLeaks’ source Trump Sarah Palin has Sean Hannity he ’s OK , too . Meanwhile , Trump ’s ostensible ally Sean Hannity Ryan , the speaker of the House Trump Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday that Assange was " a sycophant for Russia " who " steals data and Julian Assange national security . " ( Of course , one can believe the documents Assange has produced over the years while still questioning his motivations and his Julian Assange of how he obtained those files . ) Hugh Hewitt press has Hugh Hewitt ferreted out scores Hugh Hewitt inconsistencies in Trump ’s public statements . On the hacks alone , there ’s the conflict between his openly saying Russia should hack Hillary Clinton and his recent refusal to Hugh Hewitt Russia might even be a factor , or Hillary Clinton his discussion of hacking Russia the campaign and his more recent , preposterous Hillary Clinton that no one brought it up during Hillary Clinton campaign . Reporters should continue to do this , because it ’s the campaign service for the public , but it ’s not a this that Trump is n’t ashamed of the inconsistencies . this ’s calculus is much simpler and more manichean . It was often said that Barack Obama was playing "   chess " against Trump’s calculus opponents . Trump is proudly playing checkers . And he ’s winning . Barack Obama Trump Trump
