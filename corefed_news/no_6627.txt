During the Senate Judiciary Committee ’s hearing on Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch on Monday , Senator Pat Leahy ( ) stated that Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch is " a nominee selected by extreme interest groups , and nominated by a president who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes . "   Leahy began by talking about the refusal to hold hearings on Judge Merrick Garland ’s nomination to Supreme Court , saying , " Some liken it to the action of the tyrannical kings , who claim they have sole control , as one our senators referred to here a few minutes ago . But it was a blockade backed by then candidate Donald Trump . Committee Republicans met behind closed doors and declared that they would Committee Republicans the independence of this committee the Judiciary Committee the majority leader ’s bidding , and they ignored Committee Republicans Constitution in the process . In fact , this unprecedented obstruction is one of the greatest stains on the    history of this committee . the Judiciary Committee —    remember , the Judiciary Committee once stood against a    scheme of a Democratic president , that would have eroded judicial independence , and that was a proud moment . Now , Republicans on this committee are guilty the Judiciary Committee own    scheme , Republicans on this committee the blockade of Chief Judge Merrick Garland was never grounded in principle or precedent . " He added , " While Chief Judge Merrick Garland Republicans were meeting in back rooms to block President Obama ’s nominee , extreme special interest groups were also meeting in private , to vet potential Supreme Court nominees for then candidate Donald Trump . I do not know of any other Supreme Court nominee who was Supreme Court interest groups , rather than by a president in consultation with the Senate , as required by the Constitution . Now , Senate Republicans made a big show the Senate year about respecting the voice of the American people in this process . Now , they are arguing that the Senate Senate Republicans rubber stamp a the Senate the Senate extreme interest groups , and nominated by a president who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes .
