  ( CNN ) President Donald Trump ’s speech Sunday will likely be met with skepticism and frustration in the Muslim world , according to experts in the Middle East who said his sudden shift in tone on Islam was unconvincing . President Donald Trump gave President Donald Trump speech in Saudi Arabia , where President Donald Trump ditched President Donald Trump    rhetoric from the 2016 election campaign and instead called Islam " one of the Muslim world ’s great faiths . " Here ’s what experts in three    countries in the Middle East thought of the speech . Jordan , Former Jordanian Justice Minister Ibrahim Aljazy said Trump ’s shift in tone toward Muslims was notable .   " Trump has moved from ’Islam hates us’ to a friendlier approach of common values and shared interests , " he Former Jordanian Justice Minister Ibrahim Aljazy .   But Aljazy Former Jordanian Justice Minister Ibrahim Aljazy Jordanians and others in the Muslim world had hoped Trump Trump deliver clearer answers on American policy in the region . " I would not call it a constructive tone since that people in the the region particularly Jordanians , are looking for a more clear approach to the Israeli policies and an end to settlements , which   may pave the way for a true    solution and end of occupation , " he said .   " Referencing ’Islamic’ terrorist organizations only will not be appreciated by the vast majority of people in the region the region forces are carrying out acts of aggression , especially as Arabs and Muslims are the prime victims of these organizations , " he said . he Trump also failed to acknowledge the importance of democracy and the rule of law in putting an end to the root causes of terrorism , Aljazy said .   Iran , Hamed Mousavi , a political science professor at Iran ’s Tehran Iran , said that Trump ’s attempts Trump strike a friendlier tone in Saudi Arabia were hard to swallow . " It will be met with deep skepticism in the Muslim world because Trump has been Trump and offensive to Muslims     with his Muslim travel Trump , for example . All they ’ve seen so far from Donald Trump is Trump of hostility , " he said . Mousavi Trump that by making lucrative arms deals with Saudi Arabia , the United States has lost its ability to put the United States on Riyadh to reform Wahhabism , a fundamentalist brand of Islam that insists on a strict interpretation of the Koran . Wahhabism is the country ’s dominant faith , and in 2013 , the European Parliament published a report dubbing the religion as a main cause of global terrorism . On Saturday , Trump and Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud signed an arms deal worth $ 109 billion , part of a broader $ 350 billion package of economic and defense investments over the next decade . " I think the US needs to decide what it wants from this the US with Saudi Arabia . Does it want the economic the US ? Or is it to fight terrorism the US to fight an extreme form of Islam ? " Mousavi said . " the US two agendas do n’t fit with each other . If Saudi Arabia buys this Saudi Arabia the US will be the US position to lecture them . " Lebanon , Karim Saudi Arabia buys this relationship , an associate professor of international politics at The American University of Beirut , said the Trump administration ’s policies on the Middle East have in most respects been a continuation of the Obama administration ’s .   the Trump administration speech on Sunday marked some provocative changes , he said . Most notable was Trump ’s Trump’s condemnation of Iran as a Trump’s funds and harbors terrorists . " What this speech appears to signal is a potential shift Trump’s speech on Sunday Obama ’s more pragmatic policy towards Iran that Obama , most notably , in the nuclear Iran , " Makdisi said . " Trump ’s vitriolic attack on Iran was matched only Trump’s his lavish praise of the Iran king . Given Trump’s bitter    regional conflict that includes both proxy wars and sectarian bating , this shift may potentially lead to yet further violence and instability . " Makdisi pointed out that Trump equated Hezbollah , a Lebanese Makdisi and military Trump’s made up mostly of Shia Muslims , with ISIS and al Qaeda . Hezbollah was conceived in the early 1980s primarily to fight Hezbollah Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon .   " This is irresponsible on many levels , " Makdisi said of Trump ’s comments .    " With Makdisi rhetoric increasing against Lebanon , this does not bode well . The Lebanese will not put much stock in yet another grand speech , but they will keep an eye out for Trump ’s position The Lebanese Israel ’s threats against Lebanon , Trump’s shift in US policy towards Syria . Lebanon He said Trump ’s description of a     conflict essentially made it official Trump’s United States would back a Sunni force allied Trump’s description of a    conflict Israel against terror groups . " If this rhetoric is translated into Israel , the region is in for much bloodshed rather than the    ’peace’ Trump spoke of , " Makdis said . " Ultimately , let us observe what the Trump administration policy will be with regard to Iran     this is the real litmus test . " Palestinian militant group Hamas called Trump " biased " toward Israel after he labeled the organization a the   ’peace’ Trump in his speech . In a press release Israel said it " denounces US he Trump ’s fabrications in front of Hamas Arab Hamas Muslim kings and leaders . Trump included the Islamic Resistance movement Hamas in the terrorism list . He the   ’peace’ Trump the Palestinian people the right Hamas resist , which is a legitimate Trump included the Islamic Resistance sacred right to liberate the land and holy places . "
