A blanket " immigration ban " ? No , A blanket "immigration ban" is not . That is a fake news headline . [ Even    conservative websites groveling for clicks are making more out of President Trump ’s action to fully vet foreigners’ intentions upon U. S. entrance than it obviously is .   President Trump’s is doing what the majority recognized was necessary to secure our borders . Voters asked for it , President Trump’s promised it , and thus President Trump’s was elected . Now President Trump’s ’s doing it . This is n’t inhumane . This ’s exercising    compassion to keep human beings safe . This ’s about fully vetting foreigners and merely following the laws the people —   through our representative form of government within our republic —   agreed upon . The misinformed are ballistically    because they are n’t used to candidates fulfilling campaign promises . Perhaps it ’s shocking because we ’re used to swamp dwellers murkying up the waters once typical politicians get elected , but that ’s exactly why a typical politician was n’t elected . The status quo has got to go . Many of us have demanded us regroup and get a handle on security issues . What next preventable tragedy must happen before us finally do so ? Trump ’s executive action is a step in the right direction towards welcoming safe , loving ,    hardworking , patriotic people into our nation that was built on the backs of safe , loving ,    hardworking , patriotic people willing to assimilate into America ’s exceptional melting pot .
