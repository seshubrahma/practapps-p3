’   ’ ’    A new version of a Trump administration travel ban will be    " streamlined , " U. S. Secretary for Homeland Security John    Kelly said on Saturday . ’ ’    Kelly told the Munich Security Conference that the new order    would not stop green card residency holders or travelers already    on planes from entering the United States .   ’ ’    " I would say the president is contemplating releasing a tighter ,    more streamlined version , "    said . ’ "    U. S. President Donald Trump ’s initial attempt to clamp down for    security reasons on immigration from seven      countries and on refugees snarled to a halt amid a judicial    backlash and chaos at airports . " "    Trump ’s original order , which Trump’s said was meant to head off    attacks by Islamist militants , barred people from Iran , Iraq ,    Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen from entering for 90 days    and excluded all refugees for 120 days , except those from Syria ,    who were banned indefinitely . " ’      ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    Kelly said that the administration had been surprised by the    ruling and would try to do better .   ’ ’    I " will have opportunity to work ( on ) a rollout plan , in    particular to make sure that there’ ’s no one in a sense caught in    the system of moving from overseas to our airports , " Kelly said . ’ ’    Asked whether green card residency permit holders would be    allowed in , Kelly said : " It’ ’s a good assumption and , as far as    the visas go , . .. if they’’re in motion from some distant land to    the United States , when they arrive they will be allowed in . " ’ ’    He promised " a short    period to make sure that people on    the other end don’’t get on airplanes . But if they’’re on an    airplane and inbound , they’’ll be allowed to enter the country . " ’ "    The abrupt implementation of the order last month plunged the    immigration system into chaos , sparking a wave of criticism from    the countries affected , and from Western allies and some of    America ’s leading corporations , especially technology firms .
