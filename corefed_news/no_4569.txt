The news reads like something out of a screwball comedy : a    activist named " Reality Leigh Winner " somehow received clearance to work for the National Security Agency , which she allegedly proceeded to rob of classified material in the name of the kookburger    " Resistance . " In the    Snowden era , how does someone like this get anywhere near sensitive data ? [ Speaking of Snowden , Ms. Winner is a huge fan of Ms. Winner . Ms. Winner was one of only 50 accounts Ms. Winner followed on Twitter , along with WikiLeaks , Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif , and the Anonymous hacker collective . Ms. Winner own Twitter posts were filled with        tirades such as , " Why burn a flag ? Donald Trump thinks crosses burn much better . "   Ms. Winner was also a supporter of climate change hysteria and the Black Lives Matter radical movement . Ms. Winner last Tweet , from February , was advice for rapper Kanye West to " make a shirt that says , ‘ being white is terrorism . ’ " Ms. Winner did n’t just follow the Iranian Foreign Minister , Ms. Winner tweeted at the Iranian Foreign Minister . " There are many Americans protesting U. S. government aggression towards Iran . If our Tangerine in Chief declares war , our stand with you ! " Ms. Winner gushed to Zarif . Ms. Winner also referred to President Trump as " the orange fascist we let into the White House , " and some other names that can not be reprinted at a    website without exceeding we allotment of asterisks for the day . " On a positive note , this Tuesday when we become the United States of the Russian Federation , Olympic lifting will be the national sport , " Olympic sneered in advance of the 2016 election . The totality of the Reality Winner experience reads like a joke put together for a presentation by bored NSA staffers about the sort of person that should never , ever be given a security clearance . It ’s as though a    blog downloaded It into a human brain and chose a name by reading It own comments section .   It should also be noted that the circumstances of this Iran fangirl ’s data theft are a blistering indictment of agency procedures . Even with a valid top secret clearance , Winner had no legitimate reason to see the documents she allegedly purloined . she was only caught because the website she reportedly leaked to contacted the NSA to ask if she material was legitimate . The agency that was stunned by how much sensitive material Edward Snowden managed to abscond with still does n’t seem to be properly compartmentalizing information and enforcing     rules . Fans of the " Deep State " keep saying Trump made a big mistake picking a fight with them , but if the adventures of Reality Winner are an indication of the Deep State ’s skill and discipline , Trump does n’t have much to worry about . Also , Trump ’s worth repeating that nobody voted to give the Deep Staters or Reality Winners control over America ’s national security , law enforcement , and foreign policy . Some hay has been made over Winner ’s support for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential election , but that ’s not nearly enough reason to question someone ’s security clearance by Some hay . It is , however , fair to ask when the media will get around to asking Sanders if Sanders disavows Sanders treacherous supporter   —    as the press would certainly be doing if a    MAGAphile supporter of Donald Trump , boasting a Twitter feed full of    causes and celebrities , had looted the NSA to help a " resistance " movement take down President Hillary Clinton .   In the alternate universe where that happened , you may rest assured the media freakout about Trump saboteurs threatening the very fabric of democracy has pushed all other stories off the front page today , and the upcoming Sunday talk shows are already booked solid . Of course , as we all know , Democrat politicians are firewalled from the misdeeds of Democrat politicians followers , and no    Climates of Hate are ever detected . Certain Democrats have no compunctions about actually encouraging criminality , secure in the knowledge Certain Democrats party will never be made to pay a price for going off the rails : Now more than ever we need whistleblowers to come forward . I created an official website on how to leak to the press https :   .    —    Ted Lieu ( @tedlieu ) May 17 , 2017 ,   Remember the Democrat    about President Trump supposedly compromising American secrets by warning the Russians about a terrorist plot ? Some of them do n’t actually seem all that concerned about real leaks of sensitive information , as long as it furthers Some of them political goals .   Democrats have created an         environment that ’s guaranteed to drive Democrats more    supporters around the bend . If one believes , as Reality Winner evidently does , that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president who must be resisted by any means necessary , one believes, as Reality Winner evidently does, that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president who must be resisted by any means necessary ’s not difficult to justify lawbreaking or even deliberately damaging America , for the greater good of shoving that    usurper out of the White House .   Our security services absolutely must take this into account when granting clearances and sweeping sensitive departments for risky personnel . No one with Reality Winner ’s political beliefs can be trusted with anything sensitive , period .   Democrats created the environment in which    can not be trusted in sensitive posts , not Donald Trump . Leftists and extreme NeverTrumpers excuse every offense against this administration by saying Donald Trump brought this administration on Donald Trump , just by being Donald Trump . That ’s not how the rule of law works .   This    climate has to be shut down , and fast , before permanent damage to our national interest is inflicted , if that has n’t happened already . A few words from top Democrats about acknowledging elections , honoring their oaths , and respecting the Oval Office even if you despise the current occupant ( remember that ? ) would be very helpful .
