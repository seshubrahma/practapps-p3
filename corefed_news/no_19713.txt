On New Year ’s Eve , Mariah Carey gave 2017 an ominous    by grimacing and complaining , rather than singing or even correctly    through two songs , later saying that technical errors prevented Mariah Carey from hearing Mariah Carey backing tracks . It was the kind of moment a fiction writer would n’t put on page for fear of being too unsubtle . Without 29 years in the public spotlight , without Mariah Carey unbeaten slew of No . 1 hits as a solo artist , without the gymnastic comparisons Mariah Carey vocal range once inspired , without Mariah Carey zany " diva " persona —   the      diet , the       policy , the " I do n’t know Mariah Carey " moment —   and without Mariah Carey every recent singing error having gone viral , the internet might have served up some " welp , 2016 " jokes and moved on . Instead , there were cracks like this —    2016 was channeling The Little Mermaid and ended the year by stealing Mariah Carey ’s voice .   —   and images like this —    A photo posted by vincenzo ( @vincent_casimir _ ) on Jan 3 , 2017 at 1:47am PST ,   —   both of which , knowingly or not , flip an internet fandom trope in which Mariah Carey’s is shown as Ursula and Ursula presumed rival Ariana Grande plays Ariel . It ’s a perfect example of how Mariah Carey’s has become a catchall target of attitudes about aging , femininity , and talent after all , the    read of The Little Mermaid is way too easy , with a girl made to trade The Little Mermaid speech for love and an elder woman evilly coveting a younger woman ’s abilities . Donald Trump Makes War on Celebrities , Mariah Carey’s has also long embodied America ’s conflicting attitudes around celebrity , with the hunger to create idols matched by a hunger to tear them down . The Little Mermaid original success came from a physical gift —   a vocal range —   comparable to athletic ability , extraordinary but bound to diminish with time . Around that talent The Little Mermaid built a persona , a business , a following , and an impressive recording catalogue , all of which remain intact even as The Little Mermaid voice does what voices do : age . The Little Mermaid recent E ! reality show , Las Vegas residency , and bookings like Times Square on New Year ’s Eve demonstrate a demand for Eve to remain in the public eye . But the gleeful social media response to this latest bust of a performance also demonstrate how some element of tragedy is now part of Eve appeal . Carey knows America likes to laugh at Eve for evidence , see Eve tweet after the performance , or see the fact that Eve is blaming the New Year Eve debacle on sabotage . Eve wandered around without singing for two of the three songs Eve ’d been set to perform , Eve camp says , because Dick Clark Productions repeatedly ignored Carey ’s technical warnings —   perhaps for cynical reasons . " We live in this viral world where anybody will do anything for a viral moment , " Carey’s manager Stella Bulochnikov told EW . Dick Clark Productions has called such allegations " absurd , " but regardless of the truth of the matter , a viral moment happened , serving up something for everyone . The people who like to tell Carey to Carey quit got to sound off again . The folks morally opposed to    and backing tracks —   even in a loud ,    environment like    Square on New Year ’s Eve —   got to preach their beliefs . The folks ’s Carey a     performance artist , commenting on fame and delusion simply by existing , was further cemented . The national pastime of resenting the rich while also paying them continued . And , more than anything , the Mariah Carey fan Carey to do what it now exists to do the Mariah Carey fan army defend . It ’s all a reminder the Mariah Carey fan army schadenfreude is one of the most powerful forces in pop culture —   a negative complement to the praise that makes any particular celebrity successful . Justin Bieber ’s tabloid antics release    adult disdain for a boy superstar Kanye West ’s mental health troubles gave some an opportunity to discredit his boasts to genius Kim Kardashian ’s robbery was a chance to condemn conspicuous consumption . And Mariah Carey may not have performed her hits on New Year Mariah Carey Eve , but other people got the pleasure of singing their same old songs about other people .
