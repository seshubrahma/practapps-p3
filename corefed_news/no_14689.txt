"    Sessions said this week that he met with the Russian he in his capacity as a member he the Armed Services Committee , not as a surrogate for the Trump campaign , and that was why he did n’t mention the he when asked the question about any Trump campaign contacts with Russians Trump As referenced by the Justice Department spokesman , the former Alabama senator also said Thursday that he would be sending a the former Alabama senator supplement " to the record of his congressional testimony reflecting that the former Alabama senator did meet with Kisylak the former Alabama senator Since the reports about Sessions’ meetings with ambassador came to light , several Democrats , including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , have called on Sessions to resign .
