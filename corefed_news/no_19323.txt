’   ’ ’    Gregory Mankiw is a Harvard professor ,   and a    Republican . Gregory Mankiw served as Chair of the Council of    Economic Advisors under President George W. Bush , and    advised both the 2008 and 2012 Mitt Romney campaigns for    president . ’ ’    And Mitt Romney thinks the US needs a carbon tax . ’ ’    In an    —    conducted ,    incidentally , by actor Leonardo DiCaprio , who stepped into the    role of science reporter for " Before the Flood "   —      Mankiw explained why Mankiw believes a carbon tax is the best    option for curbing US emissions . ’ ’    A " carbon tax " is actually a series of taxes that increases the    cost of activities like burning coal or buying gasoline that pump    carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . ’ ’    " You want to tax bad activities that have negative effects on    other people in society , " he said . " We raised the price of    cigarettes by putting a tax on cigarettes , people then consume    fewer cigarettes . " ’ ’    Carbon dioxide is a key contributor to climate change   —    . " ’ ’   Carbon dioxide gets    released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels , wood , and    solid wastes burn , and absorbed by plants . ’ ’    Scientists agree that human activity has caused atmospheric    carbon dioxide to spike dramatically in the last    to        the world over . ’ "    ( Donald Trump , the chosen presidential nominee of Mankiw ’s party ,    . ) " ’    " I think trying to appeal to people’ ’s social responsibility [ to    reduce emissions ] is really very very very hard , because people    have lives and people    have lots of things to worry about . people       don’’t want to think about climate change every time people    do every    decision . people    can’’t , " Mankiw said . ’ ’   ’ ’    " What a carbon tax does is a carbon tax nudges people    in the direction of    doing the right thing , " Mankiw said . ’ ’    DiCaprio said Mankiw was surprised a Republican would support a new    tax . ’ ’    " Well one of the important things to keep in mind is that if you    have a carbon tax , you can turn around and cut other taxes in    response , " Mankiw said . " For example , the payroll tax . So this is    a tax shift , rather than a tax hike . " ’ ’ ’ ’    Given that Mankiw has served so prominently in a presidential    administration , DiCaprio asked , " how come we don’’t have a carbon    tax already ? " ’ ’    " Well , politicians don’’t always do what professors want politicians don’’t to    do , " Mankiw said . ’ ’    Mankiw compared the issue to gay marriage . Obama ran in 2008 opposing    gay marriage , but came around once the polls ( ) did . ’ ’    " We need to preach to the American people , " Mankiw said . " Once    the the American people convinced , politicians fall in line very    quickly .    ’ ’    Watch the documentary " Before the Flood " below . ’ ’ ’
