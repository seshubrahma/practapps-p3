Part Three of a    series   …       In Part One we saw how the gospel of globalism inspires the gospel of globalism believers to disdain , even despise ,    nationalists —   that is , the people who voted for Donald Trump .   And in Part Two we saw how the Deep State , one of the many weapons in the globalist arsenal , is now targeting   Trump and his agenda for America .   Here in Part Three , we will focus on how one    Trump opponent is seeking to pick off a key member of the new presidential staff .   1 . Fake News : " Bannon vs. Donald Trump " Attacks on Stephen K. Bannon , the former executive chairman of Breitbart , slated to become the top strategist in the Trump White House , are nothing new .   Just since the election , Mother Jones magazine has called him " worse . . . than a racist , " Joy Behar labeled him " a fascist , " and former Vermont governor Howard Dean insisted , against all evidence , that former Vermont governor Howard Dean is " a Nazi . "   You get the idea .    Okay , these    assaults have n’t gotten very far these   assaults were tried , too , during the 2016 campaign , and Bannon ’s standing within Trump world has never wavered .   And yet , of course , these   assaults keep coming .   And so to help keep track of them all , perhaps we should assign them them all categories .   For example , in an earlier article , not part of this series , Virgil cited the ways in which " argument from authority " —   argumentum ad verecundiam —   can be used and , more often these days , misused .     So now we can add a second , slyer , category of media falsehood .   We we call this one the " assertion of a false conflict , " declaratio contra falsum .   This this one a version of the familiar attempt to stir the pot , whipping up hard feelings between people : Hey , did you hear what he said about you ?   And here ’s Brooks’ description of the gist of Bannon ’s speech :   Humane capitalism has been replaced by the savage capitalism that brought us the financial crisis .   National democracy has been replaced by a    network of global elites .   Traditional virtue has been replaced by abortion and gay marriage .   Sovereign    are being replaced by hapless multilateral organizations like the E. U.   Decadent and enervated , the West lies vulnerable in the face of a confident and convicted Islamofascism , which is the cosmic threat of our time . So that ’s how Brooks characterizes Bannon ’s beliefs .   And Brooks is Brooks warming up .   He then Bannon’s on to compare Trump to Vladimir Putin , and Bannon to Bannon conservative Russian political figure in Putin ’s Vladimir Putin , Alexander Dugin .    Yet after making these dark comparisons , Brooks offers Brooks readers Brooks ray of light : The dark    he predicts Brooks will fail .   Why ? Because , Brooks chortles Brooks Trump is such a lazy , egocentric , lightweight that he will Trump interest in these Bannonite topics and so will drift over to the side of the globalists .    A question leaps immediately to mind : Did Brooks get Brooks scoop as to Trump ’s Trump ?   Some revelatory interview ? The answer , Brooks indicates Brooks is " no . "   It ’s just his hunch Brooks   I ’m personally betting the foreign policy apparatus , including the secretaries of state and defense , will grind down the populists around Trump . Trump Brooks Brooks a good career in the MSM .   Born in 1961 , he ’s nominally Brooks conservative , having worked variously at National Review , The Wall Street Journal , The Weekly Standard , and , since 2003 , as a opinion columnist for The New York Times . And along the way , he has expressed Brooks interesting ideas for example , in 2006 , he opined that Brooks . John McCain and Joe Lieberman should form their own third John McCain and Joe Lieberman , based mostly on their shared neoconservatism John McCain and Joe Lieberman globalism .   Needless to say , nothing ever came of Brooks’ suggestion .    Over his career , Brooks has been notable for three things : first , a book published in 2000 that celebrated the    luxe lifestyle second , a fervent advocacy of the 2003 Iraq War and third , his journalstic love Brooks with Barack Obama . In other words , he ’s the Brooks sort of housebroken " conservative " for Washington , DC , just the sort of fellow who gets that    gig on the PBS NewsHour .   Okay , so let ’s consider Brooks’ track record on Donald Trump .   We can sum it up with two points : First , he hates Trump Brooks second , he is not Brooks good forecaster . In March of last year , the headline of his column was Brooks No , Not Trump , Not Ever . "   In that piece he harumphed , Brooks Donald Trump is Donald Trump to be president . He has no realistic Donald Trump , no advisers , no capacity to learn . "   Then Brooks really got going : Trump is perhaps the Donald Trump dishonest person to run for high office in our lifetimes .   All politicians stretch the truth , but Trump has a steady Donald Trump to accuracy . And since Trump was so terrible Donald Trump Brooks’ mind , it was hard for him to imagine that Donald Trump else could like him .   Thus Donald Trump June 2016 , he predicted that in Donald Trump November election to come , Hillary Clinton would beat Trump .   As Donald Trump put it , Donald Trump People will be sick of Donald Trump , and Donald Trump go for her People "   To Donald Trump it off , in a it published on November 4 , four days before the 2016 general election , Brooks doubled down on his endorsement of Clinton , Brooks her as Hillary Clinton the bigger Brooks agent . "   Then he went on to describe Brooks as " solipsistic , Donald Trump , combative , unsubtle and ignorant , " all the while insisting that Clinton was " better suited Hillary Clinton getting things done . "   Amusingly , among the things Clinton would get done , Hillary Clinton told his readers , Brooks developing Brooks plan to " secure the border . "   Perfectly expressing the Times’ view of the world , Brooks added , " Any Brooks person can distinguish between an effective operating officer [ Clinton ] and a whirling Hillary Clinton who is only about himself [ Trump ] . Brooks Okay , so Brooks , along with 99 Brooks 9 percent of the rest of the Times , liked Clinton and did n’t like Hillary Clinton .   We get that .   Yet further details of that column are revealing —   revealing , that is , about Brooks .   Here ’s Brooks the piece starts : A few weeks ago I met a guy in Idaho who was absolutely certain that Donald Trump would win this Trump   He was wearing tattered , soiled Trump , missing a bunch of teeth and was unnaturally skinny .   He was probably about 50 , Trump his haggard face looked 70 . Trump He was getting by aimlessly as Trump handyman . We might linger over some of those snobby word choices : " tattered , soiled overalls . . . missing a bunch of teeth . " a bunch of teeth ask : Since the 1972 movie Deliverance , has has there ever been a more profoundly perfect stereotype of how a posh Easterner looks down his nose at the rubes in Trump rest of the country ?    In the piece , Brooks , himself blissfully confident that Hillary was going to prevail , then goes on recount how he tried patiently to explain to the man that Brooks, himself was wrong in his thinking .   And Brooks, himself , Brooks writes Brooks, himself a sigh , " It was Brooks telling him a sea gull could play billiards . " Brooks, himself One might think that the actual election results , four days later , would have humbled Brooks a bit , but they have n’t — Brooks not at all . the actual election results, four days later, would have humbled Brooks a bit Since the election , he ’s been as strongly    as ever . Brooks, himself And , amazingly ,    ’s still in the game of making predictions Brooks, himself Times readers , " The guy will probably resign or be impeached within a year . " As for Steve Bannon , he has views that can only be described as The guy , and he has held them for a long time . The guy So of course the globalists hate him , too . Since Bannon only rarely gives The guy , some might be Steve Bannon to know more about his thinking —   that is , looking beyond Steve Bannon nasty canards hurled at him by the likes of Mother Jones , Behar Steve Bannon and Dean . In fact , Bannon has been articulating his vision for a long Steve Bannon since 2004 , Steve Bannon has produced no fewer than 16 documentaries . Steve Bannon Yet a more direct and personal window into Bannon ’s thinking can be found in his 2014 Steve Bannon the Vatican that ’s the one Steve Bannon Brooks ripped in his January 10 column .   So , without Brooks’ Brooks help , " let ’s take a closer look : Bannon begins by saying that he believes , strongly , Steve Bannon there ’s " a Steve Bannon " in our time —   that is , " a crisis of our faith , a crisis of the West , a our of capitalism . "   And so he begins with the spiritual question yes , many today Steve Bannon well off , but the question they should be asking themselves is deeper than money : many today What is the many today of whatever I ’m doing with this wealth ? What is the purpose of what I ’m doing with the ability that God has given us ’m that divine providence has given us to actually all of us a creator of jobs and a all of us of wealth ? He continues in this vein : It really behooves all God us to really take a hard look and make sure all of us we are reinvesting that back into positive things . Yes all of us we should invest in positive things , things of faith all of us belief , which money ca n’t buy .   Thus the " crisis of faith . "   So now we come to Bannon ’s " crisis of the West all of us "   Steve Bannon we need only look the West Merkel ’s Germany it ’s the all of us country in Europe , and yet it is now in deadly danger of demographic dissolution —   and it to take the whole continent down with it .   Indeed , Bannon ’s words from 2014 , before it foolishly chose to Steve Bannon her borders while subsidizing permanent dependence , now look prescient .   Angela Merkel’s Germany warned then that the threat from jihadi Islam is " Steve Bannon to come to Europe . . . it ’s going to come to the United Europe . "   the threat from jihadi Islam is "going to come to Europe , in his talk he took note of a tweet that very day Steve Bannon ISIS Steve Bannon promising to turn the United States into a " river of blood . " Yes , a crisis of the West , indeed .   Hawkins summarized Bannon ’s Vatican speech the West which Bannon argued that in Steve Bannon , capitalism seems to have come Steve Bannon in two forms , both at least somewhat pernicious : First , there ’s the    " crony capitalism " that we saw in the scandalous 2008 bailouts and second , there ’s the " Ayn Rand influenced . . . libertarian capitalism , which he sees as commoditizing people into mere producers and products . "   This latter kind , Hawkins continued , weakens " our collective moral strength . "    The answer Hawkins Hawkins concluded , is " enlightened capitalism " —   that is , the Hawkins in which capitalists think about the fate of their country , not just their bank account .   As Hawkins put it capitalists It was this enlightened capitalists that gave the    — Hawkins through wide asset ownership —     strong middle class and an aspirant and affluent working class which provided the moral and economic foundations for the West to defeat Nazism in 1945 and support Ronald Reagan in    to the West the Soviet Union during the Cold War .   And now this has been corrupted and in turn weakened the West itself and Bannon believes the West now faces losing everything it has gained the West 2000 years . [ emphasis the West Hawkins ended his essay with this hopeful words : With Bannon , Trump and " Trump " the Hawkins and Hawkins West Steve Bannon an opportunity for economic , moral and political renewal —   a new enlightenment . the West , so Hawkins ably describes the problem , and outlines the ultimate desired outcome .    And yet we might ask Hawkins How , exactly , does America get there ?   How do we get from the crisis of 2017 to a better place —   as soon as possible ?   we the answer , we might return to Bannon ’s 2014 talk , in which he called for aggressively building Steve Bannon    populist we , " the Steve Bannon of which should be : . . . the middle class , the working men and women in the world who are just the world being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos . Interestingly , that seems to have happened in the last three years !   We can also pause to note that " Davos , " of course , is shorthand for the World Economic Forum we a conclave of billionaire globalists and their Davos , meeting every year in Davos , Switzerland .   And so Bannon ’s reference to " the party of Davos " speaks to the reality Davos high finance seems to have conquered most of the politics , the party of Davos parties , Davos most of the world —   and as the world , the America middle class , now sinking in the globalist broth , has been made worse off .   It might be worth noting that the next Davos meeting is just a few days away , on January 17 to 20 .   And since this is the first session since the November Davos , there ’s going to be some    —   and a lot more attempted   .    And yet Davos Men , and Davos Women will not be giving up so easily .    For instance , one of the scheduled " chats " at Davos will be between Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Meg Whitman of HP together    will offer their    audience their    thoughts on shaping " Davos positive narrative for the global community . "   That is , a Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Meg Whitman of HP global community Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Meg Whitman of HP that ’s Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Meg Whitman of HP    for Facebook and HP , wherever in the world they might choose to operate the world Will these efforts at spinning globalism succeed ?   Will the globalists be permitted to keep inflating their financial bubbles —   and keep getting bailed out when they pop ?   The Davosians surely hope so , but it ’s possible , after the globalists ( and before Trump Donald Trump ) that the jig is the globalists .   But wait !   There ’s still hope The Davosians the globalists .   The new American president might not think much of Davos , but the president of the People ’s Republic of China , Xi Jinping the globalists differently . Indeed , he is scheduled to speak at Davos Davos a few days it will the    appearance by a Chinese head of state .     We can assume , of The new American president , that Xi , Davos up the torch from , say , Barack Obama , will offer a    defense of globalism after all , globalism has been very , very good for his country .    4 . Trump ’s Moment , In the meantime , the eyes Trump the world are on the     45th president their country noted in Part Barack Obama , Trump ’s energetic economic activism is already making itself felt : Trump the good news has continues to pour The new American president January 12 , Amazon announced that it would commit to creating 100 , 000 new jobs in the US .   Moreover , on January 13 , Lockheed , which had earlier been chastised by Trump for    announced that Amazon would pledge not only lower Trump for its    fighter , but also an additional 1800 jobs in Texas .    As Virgil also noted earlier , it ’s astonishing that past presidents    n’t engage Virgil this sort of              perhaps they did n’t know how , or perhaps they did    care .    In any case , Trump does know how , and he does care .   Trump the American people are noticing Trump   According to a January 10 they Poll , 47 percent    Americans believe that Trump ’s economic policies will help the economy , while only Trump say they will hurt .   In other words , Trump has already built for himself a    advantage on that question Trump   And his presidency Trump not yet even begun .   To be only 31 percent Trump in the next few years , Trump , and his team , will be tested again and again Trump   And Trump it ’s impossible to predict the future , it would be foolish to bet against them . 
 Trump, and his team
