Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards urges Cosmopolitan readers on this day before the presidential election to recognize " the presidential nominee of the Republican party has been exposed by the presidential nominee of the Republican party own words as a sexual predator . " [ " I do n’t know a single parent in the world who wants their sons to treat women the way Donald Trump does , " Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards writes in a column at the online magazine geared to young women . Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards neglects , however , to mention any of the accusations of sexual predation and    aimed at Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton husband .   Not to mention the allegations of sexual exploitation lodged against Planned Parenthood itself . Writing at National Review , Lila Rose , president of    organization Live Action , observes : For nearly ten years , our team at Live Action has investigated Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry . During our investigations , we our Planned Planned Parenthood the sexual exploitation of minors and covering up human trafficking . We ’ve watched as Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood women with false medical information to convince them to have women to boost its bottom line . We ’ve seen We Parenthood promote Planned Parenthood abuse , dangerous sex advice to children , and gendercide . Richards , however , stands to lose federal funding for her business and restrictions Richards the primary service she offers , should Richards be elected . The president of the abortion industry giant writes about Trump : He wants Trump repeal The president of the abortion industry giant Affordable Care Act . If this happens , those under 26 will no longer be guaranteed coverage under their parents’ plans . those under 26 companies will no longer be required to cover birth control with no copay , which costs one person up to $ 600 per year just on birth control pills . Preventive care   —    like cancer screenings and annual exams   —    will no longer be guaranteed without     costs . And over 20 millions Americans could lose their health care altogether Americans At the same time , he is attacking providers who support communities by providing    care . Both Donald Trump and his running mate , Donald Trump Pence , have vowed to defund Planned Parenthood . What this really means is that millions of women who rely on critical federal health programs will lose access to breast and cervical cancer screenings , birth control ,    exams , and other preventive care at Planned Parenthood health centers Planned Parenthood many , these health centers are the Planned Parenthood health centers they will see all year . According Planned Parenthood health centers Planned Parenthood ’s own    Planned Parenthood , however , while taxpayer funding of the abortion business was increased last year , the group ’s total number of Planned Parenthood by 11 percent . The " cancer screenings " and other preventive services have fallen by 27 percent in just one year , and by 57 percent since 2010 . Similarly , Planned Parenthood ’s contraceptive services dropped by almost 18 Planned Parenthood’s one year . As for 20 million Americans who " just one year health care altogether , " it ’s become obvious to most Americans many of these " newly insured " largely have health insurance cards , but little , if any , access to real health care . This has been accomplished by the fact that major health insurers have either left Obamacare or have managed their costs by severely restricting health " choices " to customers . For major health insurers who seems to value the word " choice , " Richards is quick to disregard it when it comes to saving her abortion chain ’s federal funding . Richards and her comrades in the Richards industry want    American women to Richards they Richards n’t be able to obtain birth control , " cancer screenings American women " and other " preventive services " if Planned Parenthood is defunded . The fact is there are 13 , 000 Federally Qualified Health Centers that provide more comprehensive medical services without performing abortions   —    a figure that outnumbers Planned Parenthood facilities by 20 to 1 . Planned Parenthood ’s CEO , Planned Parenthood says Hillary Clinton ’s fight to expand Planned Parenthood is what most women want , and the proof is that in the last presidential debate , " according to a CNN focus group   …     the most favored moment of the entire debate " was Clinton ’s " embrace " of " reproductive rights . " " For the generation Hillary Clinton of age now , there ’s a lot at stake in this election , " Richards writes . " Put simply , it ’s a choice about what kind of country we want to be , what kind of future we want for this generation and the next one . Do we want a president we has worked her entire career to expand opportunities for women we families , who has made the health and    of children her priority ? " Clinton , however , is clearly not concerned about the " her and   " of unborn children . She has said unborn persons have no constitutional rights , that she would work to Clinton the longstanding Hyde Amendment , forcing Americans to pay for Clinton abortions for black and Hispanic women through the Medicaid program . Clinton also vows to appoint    Supreme Court justices . Nevertheless , a recent Marist Clinton Institute for Public Opinion poll found a full 81 percent of Americans favor some restrictions on abortion   —    including limiting the procedure after the first three months   —    and a continued ban on public funding of abortion . In the survey of 1 , 700 Americans , even 66 percent of respondents who identify themselves as    say , " Abortion should be allowed , at most , in the first trimester , in cases of rape , incest or to save the life of the mother , or never permitted .
