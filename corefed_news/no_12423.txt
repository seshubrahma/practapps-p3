" I would think that a lot of    people who are people of faith , Christian , Catholic , whatever you wanna call it , but since Milo does n’t fit that exact paradigm of what a person of faith is , a person of faith ’s gay , a person of faith ’s fabulous , a person of faith ’s very flamboyant in what a person of faith believes in , I think for me being a Christian and also thinking gay people should have rights is out of the box in some regards to my other very conservative friends . I think that Milo lets us know that you can be    but also have    characteristics and that ’s okay " .
