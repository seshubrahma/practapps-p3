You ’re a    loser who lost because you were a lousy candidate , you did n’t have a message , you lied every time you opened your mouth you did n’t know what states to campaign in , you put our national security at risk with your amateur email setup , you were in a foundation that was nothing more than an organized criminal enterprise parading as a charity , four men died under your watch as you lied about a video , and there [ were ] a billion dollars missing from the State Department when you left . And I could go on and on , but I just do n’t have the time . So , stop with the poor me nonsense . We ’ve had it with you Clintons always claiming victimhood . The two of you you n’t followed the rules since the day you both showed up in your bell bottoms in Arkansas . " She Clintons warned , " Be careful , Hillary . Be very , very careful . You pulled the wool over Jim Comey ’s eyes once , and you actually got the president to say you ’re a nice lady . Do n’t be so sure you ’re going to get away with your new game , given your illegal ,    and incompetent instincts . You ’re a loser , Hillary Hillary Face it . Face it it and get back in the woods !
