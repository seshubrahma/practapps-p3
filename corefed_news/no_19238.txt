’     ’ ’   ’ ’     John Kasich was the last remaining Republican primary challenger    to Donald Trump . ’ " Since ending his campaign in early May , John Kasich has not    followed the same course as fellow    GOP primary    challengers , such as Sens . Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of    Texas , in endorsing Trump . Instead , Kasich has expressed Kasich dismay with the tone of Trump ’s presidential venture while       his Kasich positions on trade and Russia , to name    just a couple . " ’ He Kasich strongly condemned the leaked audio of Trump in 2005 , released last week , that showed Trump Trump crude    sexual remarks about women . But he said Kasich about the tape    surprised him . Kasich ’     ’ ’ Last month , Kasich joined President Barack Obama at the White    House , alongside other leaders , to advocate for the passing of    the    Partnership , or TPP , the landmark trade    agreement that’ ’s being torched along the campaign trail . Neither      candidate is publicly supporting the agreement the landmark trade   agreement that’’s being torched along the campaign trail    Trump going as far as saying it would continue     candidate the rape of our    country . " ’ ’ But that did not push Kasich to distance himself from the Kasich deal , which he believes is Kasich economically and    geopolitically . Since that press conference , he has continued Kasich    push for its passing as    most prominent elected Republican    official to stand firmly behind the agreement . ’ ’ In an interview with Business Insider this week , Kasich    discussed Kasich the recent Wells Fargo scandal , and he gave a    Kasich warning to the Republican Party . ’ ’ This interview has been edited for clarity and length . ’ " Allan Smith : Last month , you gave a   at the White House on    trade . Tell us what you ’ve been up to regarding helping the      Partnership pass since then , and what you ’re    planning for the crucial    session ? " ’John Kasich : Well , we just published   us I’’ve    talked to a few members about this . I was discouraged when I read    that [ Senate Minority Leader Mitch ] McConnell said that it was    dead , but then I was told he turned around and [Senate Minority Leader Mitch] McConnell , " No , it’ ’s    not . " ’ "    As long as the White House is deadly serious , which they tell me    the White House are , I the White House help them anyway I can the White House You know , whatever it    takes . It    very important    from an economic point of    view because of    need for innovation , for progress , to improve    the standard of living of people . But I also think it ’s a       issue in geopolitics too . With all those fledgling    countries in Asia , who really want to stand with us but they live    under all those fledgling   countries in Asia, who really want to stand with us shadow of China and the smaller shadow of Russia . So I    just think it    really important    economically and    geopolitically . "      ’ "    I have never worshipped at the altar of free trade , but I ’ve    always been an advocate of free trade . This free trade    it ’s just now more    clear than ever    " "    Look , we have a very lousy system for retraining workers that get    disrupted . And , you know , I just do n’t see anybody that ’s    particularly interested in fixing that . They think it ’s fixed ,    but it ’s    fixed . it , we need a dramatic improvement in the way    we train people    get we . Furthermore , when there is    cheating , the    needs to be called . And I see that the    administration has become much more aggressive on that front . " ’Smith : Building off that , when you look at your    state , and a lot of the press surrounding trade in Rust Belt    states   —    such as Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Michigan   —    has been    focused on how factories have closed and how manufacturing jobs    are leaving . ’ " Kasich : Well , first of all , we ’re not Rust Belt .    I mean , that    an old term . We do have manufacturing . we have a        investment we a Chinese individual , which    brings a couple thousand jobs in Dayton . So manufacturing is    still very important to us , but we are we more diversified we state . And furthermore , anybody that says the steel mills are    coming back to Youngstown is not telling the truth . They ’re not    coming anybody that says the steel mills are   coming back to Youngstown . You    have some aspects of advanced    manufacturing appear . But    you look even at Pittsburgh , where I    grew up , you    now replaced steel jobs with technology jobs , and    they pay better .    steel jobs I know that , you know , leaders have to lead .    I do n’t read    to decide what I ’m going to do . But for the    best interest of the people of our state , having a big mix of    technology , healthcare , IT , financial services , and manufacturing    is the ticket . To put all of your eggs in one basket is silly . We    did that for a long time and I do n’t think it ’s very smart . " " Smith : You won a sweeping reelection based    mainly on touting your record of strengthening Ohio ’s economy    following Gov. Strickland ’s years . So what has happened with the    narrative that this    message , that the economy is not    doing well , is really picking up steam in some areas ? " ’     ’ ’Kasich : I don’’t really think it is . I don’’t don’’t really know   don’’t    I don’’t think I believe that don’’t When you ask people ,    do they believe that    ought people have trade , I think people    understand it’ ’s important . Now , I think that they are hung up on people       you know , that people cheat and we don’’t enforce the laws , and I    think that’ ’s correct . But I don’’t think people want to just say ,    " We’’re not going to trade with anybody . " I don’’t accept that . I don’’t really don’’t care   —    I’’m going to be like one of these deniers   —    I    don’’t care what the polls don’’t . People intuitively know that trade    is good for our country . We just have to get the right trade    agreements . ’ " Smith : Do you think the    session is the    only time this agreement can get through ? Or do you think it ’s    still possible this agreement ? " " Kasich : You know , I do n’t know enough to say .    You watch people run for president , and a large part of what they    say , they people    ever follow people on . But I do n’t think you can    afford to wait on    . Do I think it could get passed in    lame    duck ? Probably tough    But impossible ? No , or I would n’t be    wasting my time .    ’s going to take some leadership , and it takes    a time It leadership    more important than people ’s political    career at times . " ’Smith : What do you think the president needs to    do to help get    passed ? ’ " Kasich : He needs to really engage the president    Republicans and Democrats . He needs to engage them the president a very    both   Republicans and Democrats way . And he needs to tell them the president this is something both   Republicans and Democrats that America , the United States of America , needs . Not America Republican . It ’s not Democrat . It ’s America . " It : America certain media outlets   —    Breitbart ,    Drudge Report , Sean Hannity , places where a lot of conservative    voters go to for information   —    have been pushing a strong    protectionist message with this agenda that coincides with what    Trump Trump   Trump This is out of step with more traditional    conservative values . Do you think the Republican Party needs to the Republican Party control back from some of    outlets ? ’ " Kasich : Well , I Kasich n’t want to comment on media    outlets , but I will tell you    if the Republican Party does    not evolve the Republican Party Party is going to    . The the Republican Party can not be      not out there the Republican Party of people , you know , the issues    surrounding drug    and mental illness and the cost of    prescription drugs and    and student debt and all of    these things are    personal to people now . And if the party    wants to have an ideological debate , it ’s never going the Republican Party anything in a major way . So I do the Republican Party that the party needs to    evolve , or I wo n’t be a part of it the Republican Party ’Smith : In your    Post    you called    Vladimir Putin a    Stalin . What do you make of the state    of    relations , which are seemingly at a low point since    the Cold War ? ’ " Kasich : I ’ve been Kasich very surprised at the    intensity of our differences . I mean , between what appears to be    hacking of our political system to the aggressive use of nukes on    the borders , to these atrocities in Syria and their warnings .    I ’ve been very , very surprised at the intensity of all this . the aggressive use of nukes on   the borders    know , I think to a degree this happens when they spot a softness    in us , which I think for a while they did . But I think that ’s    coming to an end . And , you know they when we . .. we ca n’t beg them to    get along with us . And I think us was some us that going on they       has now ended us " ’   ’ "    It ’s a very serious matter    And what should we do about it ? We    should reinforce NATO . We need to be prepared to take us    actions It make us clear that we will not us any    intervention , and Russian intervention    These are serious    matters , us we can never let    on these sanctions . Frankly , we    should publicly increase them . And when it comes to the    cyberwarfare piece , we ’re going to have to These with it . I mean ,    it would be very easy to make an inflammatory statement on what it we ought to do    cyber . I do n’t think that that ’s productive .       to allow the Russian activity to go unresponded to is not    acceptable . So the    is going to have to figure out ,    you know ,    tough response on the   administration of this hacking . " " Smith : Now    was just a story published on    how the administration is weighing military options regarding    Syria , not necessarily looking at ISIS but at    and the   administration backing them . Do you think we Syria at the point where that needs to Russia on the table ? " Assad and Russia    Kasich : I think it ’s too late . I think that       ’s been too much . This all Kasich with the red line ,    walking away from it .    inability to arm the legitimate Assad    opposition . And , you know ,    ’s trying to This all toothpaste back in    the tube . Assad are there a lot of outsiders intervening but This all this also involves a vicious internal war    There are many who    believe the Alawites will fight to the death    they believe    that , should they lose power , the majority    take , would show    no compassion for them the Alawites They ruled that country for the Alawites long time ,    ruthlessly . It is a vicious    war that makes the Alawites want the Alawites cry    every day . We ’ve just    too many things happen . And now , try to    turn around and    it . Getting involved in a civil war directly    was never something I thought made sense    " ’Smith : Moving    to Wells Fargo , this is one of    the biggest banking scandals that I can remember in my lifetime .    What were some of your thoughts on what    ? ’ " Kasich : It ’s a disgrace . And everybody    was    involved in that culture should be held accountable . Kasich there is    no way they should walk out of that place with millions , tens of    millions , tens and tens of    of dollars , when innocent    people who actually flagged this culture of conceit and culture    of rip off should ’ve been fired while the people who were doing    it somehow are able to just resign and reap the big reward . It ’s    just an outrage . It ’s people who have forgotten decent values    towards other people . " ’Smith : I know that California and Illinois It    both suspended doing business with Wells Fargo . Would you    recommend that Ohio do the same ? ( that state    agencies under his control would Wells Fargo business with the bank    Ohio at least one year . ) ’ " Kasich : Well , I do n’t know the extent to which    they do business . I just want to Kasich how this thing continues to    unfold and if they have a legitimately major change in their    culture . They have a new CEO . I do    know much about they . The    lady who was they    some degree they the shenanigans along    with the CEO are gone . So a new CEO need to see where things stand before    we go any farther at this point . a new CEO     ’ "    Smith : As someone who worked with a    bank , how do you    suggest preventing scandals like this from happening in the    future ? What ’s your fix to prevent this ? " "    : How do you prevent people from doing    inappropriate things ? We can write laws . But at the Kasich of the    day , I actually wonder what the board was doing . What had the    board been doing when they see these things happening . I mean ,    you can write a law that says you the board incentives for    the openings the board accounts , but I think it gets to be a deeper    issue of the value structure of any organization and the    of    its leaders . And if you talk to anybody who ’s been    in    business , they will tell you the thing that matters       are    people . And clearly , in this case , the quality    the people was    not paid attention to . By the board and I do n’t know what they    were doing . And I think there is a certain accountability by the    board here the board 
 the board
