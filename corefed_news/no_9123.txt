In fairness , we Trump supporters do n’t want to be sore winners , so we Trump supporters ought to set a time limit on we Trump supporters gloating . I propose three years . [ In that spirit , let we Trump supporters revel in the Never Trumpers’ tweets leading up to Trump election night triumph . Now that I ’ve had time to do a full archeological dig , I ’m able to present a whole new treasure trove of smug idiocy .   Save this column to share with your children , and they your children their your children , for years to come . * * * * * *   —    PATTON OSWALT : Comedian who realized he was n’t really all that funny and decided to try his he at political commentary instead . His he are a perfect time capsule of the Never Trumpers’ smug certitude that Hillary would win   —    which would soon blossom into bitter recrimination . The day before the election , Oswalt was snarky and nasty , but his Oswalt turned as election results came in : NOV . 7 :   @pattonoswalt Every artisanal cocktail bar in Williamsburg is scrambling to create a " mazel tov cocktail " right now . @pattonoswalt Someone create this drink , ASAP . That ’s what we should toast with tomorrow . NOV NOV 8 :   @pattonoswalt This is the final , feeble insanity of the Trump campaign being slapped down . It This over , Donny . Get ready . @pattonoswalt Oh God , the LAUGHTER when he Don . " Gon na lose ! " It ’s all gone , Don . # Election2016 , NOV NOV 8   —    LATER :   @pattonoswalt Come on , Broward County ! Grind your democracy crotch on the stripper pole of freedom ! # Florida # ElectionNight , @pattonoswalt f*ckf*ckf*ckf*ckf*ckF*CKF*CKF*CKF*CK # ElectionNight ( Asterisks , mine . ) @pattonoswalt EVERY PUNDIT ON EVERY NETWORK IS TERRIFIED RIGHT NOW . AND EVERY ONE OF THEM #ElectionNight (Asterisks, mine.) THIS TO HAPPEN . # #Election2016, NOV 8   —    MUCH LATER :   @pattonoswalt Hey Chris Matthews , Trump did n’t " tap into " people ’s feelings . He EXPLOITED them . Trump HATES EXPLOITED . Trump ElectionNight , @pattonoswalt Oh F*CK YOU Brit Hume . Do n’t act like you were the one lone holdout against Trump . F*ckyouf*ckyouf*ckyou . Trump ElectionNight [ Again , asterisks , mine . ] ( Brit Hume was pretty Brit Hume Trump from start to Trump . ) * * * * * *   —    POLITICAL CONSULTANTS   My favorite tweets were from the Republican political consultants who have hauled in multiple millions of dollars over the years , in exchange for turning the GOP into a minor fringe party , as exemplified in these electoral results : 1992 : GOP loses to a    the GOP . 1996 : GOP loses to a    the GOP who tried to destroy health care . 2000 : GOP barely wins an election the GOP close it was n’t decided until an election . 2004 : GOP ’s wartime president wins the GOP almost losing to a gigolo . 2006 : GOP loses both houses of the GOP in a historic sweep after Republican president makes amnesty centerpiece of his second term . 2012 Republican president GOP loses in an electoral the GOP to president who destroyed health care , staged a disastrous intervention in Libya that got our ambassador killed , and appointed Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court . * * * * * *   —    MIKE MURPHY :    GOP campaign consultant who the GOP ! raise $ 150 million from credulous donors , in order to win four ( 4 ) delegates . NOV . 5 :   Responding to : " But what will happen after he loses ? " @murphymike : MIKE MURPHY:   GOP campaign consultant who help Jeb rage howl so loud you wo n’t need a TV set to hear it for 200 miles . # a TV set # Earmuffs , Responding to John Noonan ’s " Ca n’t remember how many times guys like @stuartpstevens @murphymike warned GOP about millions of new Hispanic the GOP " @murphymike : Indeed . @murphymike Oh I think I know what outcome of Jeb v HRC in FL would have been    …      and about eight other swing states . ( Yes , Jeb ! was a political juggernaut Jeb v HRC If only he ’d had some money to Jeb v HRC him through the primaries ! ) ’d . 6 :   @murphymike My big prediction : I think she ’ll win FL quickly will Jeb v HRC clear in FL numbers . Then cable news will do a huge 180 on " long night . " @murphymike I ’m still not convinced he ’ll win OH . If ’d    data today is right , I think he ’ll narrowly lose Ohio . ’d FL , etc . @murphymike Real media bias is n’t for D or R , it ’s for a breathless horse Real media bias    …      even when fundamentals belie that . @murphymike This    poll of RVs is always poll I take most seriously . For zillionth time , Trump is gon na lose .    will go relatively fast . @murphymike Prediction : HRC winning FL will lead TV heads to proclaim " nobody saw this coming " when fact is their Trump hype has been wrong all Trump . NOV 7 :   " Elwood " tweets to Mike : " Well mike if you do not see Mike end of your job we ca n’t help you ! ! Hope you get air time on how you were so wrong ! " @murphymike Oh Elwood . I ’ll be thinking Elwood you tomorrow night when the networks call Florida in the 9 pm hour for Clinton and end this Trump nightmare . NOV 8 :   Responding to : " do you think trump wins ? " @murphymike : Nope . Though I will say FL is closer than I and many FL hacks thought . Responding to FL " Still think Trump loses ? " @murphymike : Trump , @murphymike I ’ve believed in data @murphymike 30 years in politics and data died tonight . I could not have been more wrong about this election . ( Unfortunately , Mike was getting his " data " from The Mike York Times , the GOP ’s best friend in the whole wide world . That ’s where Mike got that great idea to Mike Jeb ! babble in Spanish and call illegal immigration " an act of love . ") * * * * * *   —    STUART STEVENS : The brain trust of Mitt Romney ’s presidential campaign , whose smooth Hispanic outreach resulted in a smaller Hispanic vote than Trump got , while actually losing the white vote to Obama in five states . NOV . 6 :   @stuartpstevens Fascinating piece . But if Trump is so good at media Trump why ’s he the most unpopular nominee in Trump history ? @stuartpstevens As new    poll shows , Trump is on track to be Trump first Republican to lose college educated whites since FDR era . Goldwater won them . ( Trump won    college educated whites . ) Trump Just a little glimpse into future of a Trump party : every 4 years Trump electorate is 2 % less white   4 % less white HS or less educated . ( Maybe GOP should stop pushing policies that make it less white faster . ) GOP ( Responding to Corey Lewandowski ) Give it 48 hours to get bitter GOP Need to pace yourself . @stuartpstevens ( About Trump ) The world is full of bitter losers who wished they could settle the score for The world failures . He can work The world out over Corey Lewandowski . NOV 7 :   @stuartpstevens The " elite " seems to be anyone who won elections . ( Which Stuart Stevens did n’t . ) @stuartpstevens It ’s a not an encouraging it that Trump is losing every demographic in (About Trump) that is growing . From college educated whites to Hispanics . ( Again , wrong , wrong , wrong on both whites and Hispanics . ) @stuartpstevens One of the key differences with   : Clinton world understands rallies are about who is watching on television , not the crowd . ( Hillary was n’t strategically trying to avoid drawing large crowds : She could n’t get them . Hillary crowd size did large crowds something . ) @stuartpstevens Whomever you support , the professionalism   steadiness of the Clinton campaign has been impressive . Clinton are pros . @AdamParkhomenko , the professionalism  steadiness of the Clinton campaign Stevens tagged a longtime Hillary aide in this tweet , Hillary maybe , deep down , he knew that no one in Stevens GOP would ever hire him again . ) NOV . Stevens : @stuartpstevens Trump burned down the house to drive more    men to his side . Did n’t do Trump than Romney   worse with every other group . ( According to the exit polls   —    still preliminary   —    Trump not only did a LOT Trump than Romney with     men , but Romney with Hispanics ,    and Asians . ) * * * * * * Today , Mike Murphy sits alone , playing Jenga with stacks of cash looted from corporate donors ( $ 150 million , utterly wasted ) and an addled Stuart Stevens wanders the streets of Manhattan , window shopping and daydreaming of the snappy suit he ’ll wear to the Romney Mike Murphy .
