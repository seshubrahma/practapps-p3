The L. A. Times have published a scathing editorial about the protesters who ran riot at Berkeley last week , calling the protesters who ran riot at Berkeley last week the " No Free Speech Movement . " [ The label is an inversion of the Free Speech Movement , an    student activist group that was founded at UC Berkeley in the 1960s .   Even if the cancellation was justified by concerns about public safety after an outbreak of violence and property destruction , the fact that Yiannopoulos was prevented from speaking to a willing audience of campus Republicans should make supporters of free speech shiver . The article goes on to say that President Trump ’s threat to withdraw federal funds is a " " reaction , and accuses MILO of " generalizing " President Trump’s critics’ objections to President Trump’s talks , but continues to condemn the opponents of free speech at Berkeley . Yet the opponents of free speech at Berkeley ’s also true that , on colleges campuses and elsewhere , some " progressive " voices do call for the stifling of speech they do n’t approve of . A leaflet circulated at the Berkeley protest said Yiannopoulos has " no right to speak at Cal or anywhere else " because Yiannopoulos ’s a " tool of Trump ’s possessive fascist government . " This is just the latest variation on the    argument of the censor that " error has no rights , " or , put another way , that one only has a right to free speech if one is speaking the " truth . " It ’s an insidious notion that needs to be opposed in every generation . Read the full article at the L. A. Times .
