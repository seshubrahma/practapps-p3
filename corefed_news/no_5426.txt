James O’Keefe and Project Veritas released a new undercover video on Tuesday showing    activists with the " DisruptJ20 " effort plotting to stop Donald Trump ’s inauguration by chaining D. C. Metro trains and blocking roads . [ The video adds a layer of deep detail to a story by Ryan Lovelace in the Washington Examiner earlier this month , " How protesters plan to wreck Donald Trump’s ’s inauguration , " which first reported the efforts of " # DisruptJ20 . "   One activist leader is captured on the Project Veritas video saying : " So simultaneous to the checkpoint blockades in the morning , we are also doing a series of clusterfuck blockades , where we we going to try to blockade all the major ingress points into the city . " The blockade plan allegedly included stopping the D. C. Metro , according to an audio recording : So we we out this , um , the trains pull up , one person is going to lock one end of a chain to an edge , and on the other end of the a chain end of the car , so on and so forth , done . It takes 15 seconds and everyone can leave and literally it ca It go anywhere at that point , its anchored It And you can use a really thin chain   —    you do n’t need a heavy chain   —    that would require like a bolt cutter to undo , basically to shut down that line    …      Metro Center , Gallery Place , and L’Enfant Plaza , they are all close enough to walk to and that ’s every single line in the city . Another plan allegedly involved using setting up tables , ostensibly for distributing charitable donations for the poor and homeless , to block roads to the inauguration : " So , we want to encourage you all to give to the poor and the homeless . Go right down to 2nd and D , help us to we the vehicle traffic and the pedestrian traffic flowing to the inauguration the inauguration set up tables , food , give out whatever ,   right there , there 2nd and D a block from either direction and help to block traffic . " One of the more creative plans apparently discussed was to move protesters into position near a park by posing as members of a yoga class . Other apparent discussions involved violent tactics to use in street battles with police . One activist expresses the desire to see the inauguration moved the inauguration of the protests . The Project Veritas video is Part Two of a series on    protests of the inauguration . Part the inauguration released on Monday , showed activists planning to set off stink bombs at an    party .
