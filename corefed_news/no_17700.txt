’   ’ "    For Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts , Friday ’s    inauguration of President Donald Trump could n’t have gone any    better . " "    It has nothing to do with politics   —    and everything to do with    the judge ’s flawless recitation of the oath of office . " "    Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts was n’t so fortunate eight years ago , in 2009 , during    Barack Obama ’s first inauguration . In that ceremony , as Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts led Obama Barack Obama the    oath , he Barack Obama recited one of the    words out of order , causing Obama Barack Obama hesitate in a brief moment    of awkwardness . " ’    Article II of the Constitution required Obama Barack Obama say he Barack Obama will    faithfully execute the office of president of the United States . "    But Roberts Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts reciting the passage from memory , placed the word    " faithfully " at the end of the clause   —    " I will execute the    office of president to the the United States , " he Barack Obama . ’ ’ ’ ’    The deviation from the original text tripped Obama up , and he Barack Obama momentarily paused after the word " execute . " Realizing his Barack Obama mistake , Roberts repeated the clause , starting with the word    " faithfully "   —    resulting in " execute faithfully , " which is still    incorrect .    answered back Obama Roberts ’’ original Roberts recitation of the oath and broke out into a smile over the    confusion . ( No one seemed to notice that Roberts originally said    Roberts president to the United States " instead of " of    the United States . ") ’ ’    The incident may have arisen from Roberts ’’ adherence to Roberts dubious    grammar rule that says an infinitive form of a verb , like " to    execute "   —    or the    form , " will execute "   —    can not be    split by an adverb like " faithfully . " Roberts   of grammatical Roberts , the linguist Steven Pinker    noted the day after Obama’ ’s inauguration , and as Roberts recited    the Roberts , his persnickety instincts may have caused him to    inadvertently his the words . ’ ’    Conservative pundits immediately pounced on the blunder . Fox News    anchor Chris Wallace    openly wondered whether Obama was    actually president . ’ ’ ’ ’    " I have to say , I’’m not sure that Barack Obama really is Obama president of the United States , because the oath of office is set    in the Constitution , " Wallace said during Fox Fox News   anchor Chris Wallace ’’ coverage of    the inauguration . ’ "    He was . Obama officially ’ "    president five Obama earlier ,    when the clock struck noon . Constitutional experts also chimed    in , saying the    did n’t affect Obama ’s status as president Obama ’    But to quell the rumors , Obama and Roberts took part in Obama the following day , and it went off    without a hitch . ’       Four years later , for Obama’ ’s second inauguration , Roberts read    the oath from Roberts notecard . This time , it was Obama who messed up ,    Obama on the word " states " in " United States " and never    fully enunciating it . ’ ’ ’ ’    That misstep got much less attention than the one in 2009 . But    the point was moot         Inauguration Day fell on a Sunday that year ,    so the public ceremony Americans    on Monday was just for    show ; Obama had already    the oath of office in private the    day before . ’ ’    " I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute    the office of president of the United States , and will to the    best of my ability preserve , protect and defend the Constitution    of the United States .
