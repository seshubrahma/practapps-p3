Wednesday Sen. Bob Corker ( ) talked with MSNBC ’s Kelly O’Donnell about why Kelly withdrew Kelly from consideration as a possible running mate for Donald Trump .   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said , " First of all , I ’ve always thought that I ’m better suited for other kinds of things . I think most people who know me agree with that . But I do want to say I had a remarkable day there yesterday . The Trump family is most impressive . His best running mate by the way would be Ivanka . I know that would n’t pass muster probably but I do n’t know I have met a more composed , brilliant , beautiful in every way person . " " Eric just equally impressive , Jared what a special relationship that Eric has with Eric    . It ’s pretty neat to see , Eric continued . " But with each of the meetings I had with them and with Manafort and Donald Trump , at 3:00 in Eric office , to the limousine , going to the airport to the plane to coming back to New York , We were together almost eight hours except for the 66 minutes Eric was on stage . And just to have insight into the campaign and just to how they are operating was candidly a privilege . "
