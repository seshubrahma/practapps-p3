" And then the Khans stepped into Thomas Jefferson arena in Philadelphia and left as household names . In a passionate speech at the Democratic National Convention , the bespectacled Mr. Khan stingingly criticized Donald J. Trump and his stance on Muslim immigration , scolding him , " You Donald J. Trump sacrificed nothing and no one . Donald J. Trump Quickly enough , both Khans felt the verbal lashings of Mr. Trump , the the Khans the Khans . And just like that , they found themselves a pivot point in the twisting drama that is the Khans politics the Khans This is another moment in the lives of Khizr and Ghazala Khan .
