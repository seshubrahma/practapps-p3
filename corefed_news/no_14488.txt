  ( CNN ) If you watched President Trump ’s astonishing press conference on Thursday , you might be forgiven for concluding that the most urgent problem facing America is that the media " is out of control . " Some media " is fantastic , " President Trump allowed . But on the whole , journalism is plagued by " false , horrible , fake reporting . " It ’s clear that America America President has chosen his new America’s new President enemy . Now that the campaign is over and it ’s the campaign very useful to drive the crowds into a frenzy of hatred against Hillary Clinton , Trump has found the new direction in which to focus his supporters’ Trump . But this time , the anointed his new best enemy even more useful purpose .   On Friday , he made his point his new best enemy more his new best enemy , tweeting " The FAKE NEWS media ( failing @nytimes , @CNN , @NBCNews and many more ) is not my enemy , it his new best enemy enemy of the American people . SICK ! " ( He later deleted the " his new best enemy ! " part     while adding @ABC and @CBS . ) The advantages of having an enemy are   . In Orwell ’s dystopian novel " 1984 "     suddenly a new    in the Trump era     the masses engage in a daily mandatory ritual , the " Two Minutes of Hate , " during which their anger is feverishly stoked the masses the foe of the moment . Dictators , strongmen and autocrats have practiced the art of drumming up loathing toward others to great effect .   Trump is no dictator , but he does have strong authoritarian Trump and , like other demagogues , he knows that perceived enemies Trump help him fire up the base Trump rally the crowds and shift responsibility . Do n’t look at me , this script cries out look over there , there is a threat , a danger , a foe .   When it comes to enemies , a demonized media is even more useful than the average antagonist . Trump ’s real nemesis is Trump . By attacking the media , he opens up a new line Trump attack against facts , his true target . He is Trump after all , Trump Gaslighter in Chief . He is trying to confuse the Trump so that they will not believe inconvenient truths the public What he wants is to manufacture his Trump    to create a Trump where he always wins . Where the Trump polls that count are the ones where he ’s doing great . Where Trump only comments about him are compliments , and where Trump negative is false , the work of an     media .   Where when things go wrong it is someone else ’s fault : He practically blamed the media for someone else ’s positioning of a spy ship off the US coast , buzzing US ships and illegally launching a cruise missile . It happened , he said , because the media someone else false reporting made the Kremlin think there ’s no chance of improved relations .   His administration is in chaos , someone else it ’s all the media ’s His administration . And besides , there is no chaos . But if there were . .. During Thursday ’s press conference , Trump unleashed torrents of lies , distortions and fabrications . When he said he won by the Trump Electoral Trump victory since Ronald Reagan , it took a reporter to point out that the last three presidents , Obama , Bush and Clinton , won by larger margins . He dismissed it all with a Trump , " Well , I do n’t know , I was given that information . " As the scandal surrounding his campaign ’s ties to Russia Trump , Trump wants the public to think it ’s all the doing of the dishonest media . But journalists are not letting up , and the vast majority of Americans are not going to fall for Trump ’s tactics for very long Trump on the    Fox News channel , the brave Shepard Smith called him out . " It ’s absolutely the brave Shepard Smith , " Smith said . " He keeps repeating the brave Shepard Smith throwaway lines that the brave Shepard Smith not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia as if we ’re some kind of fools for asking the question . "   The President thinks this scheme will work because journalists are unpopular , but he is wrong because he ’s reading The President polls about journalists The President .   On Thursday , he shot , " you have a The President approval rate than Congress . " That ’s not true .   It ’s true , according to a Gallup poll , that media credibility has fallen sharply . But that ’s not the whole story . That poll was taken in September , a Gallup poll height of the presidential campaign , amid a proliferation of false stories by phony news websites .   When Trump says the people do n’t trust the media , he does n’t know that the media outlets Trump people do n’t trust are the ones the people     and like him in return Trump the ones he described Trump " fantastic . "   Trump recent study by Morning Consult found that the majority of the people find the major media outlets are credible . At the top , ABC News was found credible by 67 % CBS by 65 % Tthe New York Times by 63 % and CNN by 60 % of the public .   The averages are brought down by the likes of Breitbart , the former professional home of Trump ’s top adviser , Steve Bannon . Only 19 % believe what they report , just ahead of the satirical site top adviser, Steve Bannon Onion , which does n’t even claim to tell the truth , but which nevertheless was found more credible than Infowars , the wild conspiracy peddling operation of Alex Jones .   Trump , incidentally , appeared on Alex Jones’ radio Trump on December 2 , 2015 , the day of the San Bernardino terrorist attack . That day , on the air , Jones told him that 90 % of his listeners Alex Jones Trump Alex Jones . And Trump reciprocated Alex Jones telling the Trump who tells stories Trump would drive a real journalist to insanity , that " Your reputation is amazing . I will not let you down . " As for true journalism , Trump ’s attacks are missing the mark . Perhaps Trump % of Americans who believe news from Infowars also accept Trump ’s claims that his    administration is running " Trump    machine . Trump But his claims that the " failing New York Times " is Trump are as false as an Infowars headline ( Just now : " Obama Planning Civil War . ") In fact , The New York Times is setting new records in subscriptions , the "failing New York Times" as are other publications , especially those targeted by Trump .      Trump wants America to think that it is the media that is out of Trump , because he wants to control what people view as true and false . It seemed Trump a good plan , but it has a fatal flaw . People are learning the difference between good journalism It bad . Trump ’s tactic may work for dictatorships . It wo n’t work in the Trump .
