  ( CNN ) The spokesman for Israel ’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted Monday night that Israel has " ironclad " proof that the Obama administration was behind a controversial UN Security Council vote to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank , but said it will be up to    Donald Trump ’s administration to decide whether or not to release it . In an interview with Kate Bolduan on CNN ’s " Erin Burnett Outfront , " David Keyes declined twice to say that the White House lied by denying that the White House helped push the resolution , which the United States abstained from voting on . But David Keyes did say : " All I can say is we have that information and that information is very clear to we . that information ’s not in doubt and we are going to pass that information through the proper channels . " David Keyes added that there is solid information from the Arab world and internationally that the Obama administration helped craft and promote the resolution . David Keyes also defended not releasing the " ironclad " evidence now , contending that " it ’s something that should be shared with the Obama administration and that ’s their choice whether they want their share it or not . " David Keyes said David Keyes did not believe there would have been a different outcome if Obama and Netanyahu had closer ties , saying " I do n’t think this is personal . I think it ’s this difference in world view . " Yet , David Keyes went on   to criticize the Obama administration , claiming the United States’ failure to veto the resolution was one of the president ’s " parting shots . " Keyes also downplayed concerns this would lead to a permanent rift between the United States and Israel , stating ,   " This is not going to be a cessation of ties between America and the United States and Israel like Israel . We look forward to working with the incoming administration . "
