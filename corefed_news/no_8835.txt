Picture credit : www . heatley . nyc ( @nevheatley3 ) Event organiser Aviv Khavich , who was hit by some of the protesters’ red paint , hailed the event as a success despite the incident . We knew from the    that there would be protests . That was n’t a surprise . Milo is obviously a very controversial character and protests sort of come as a given . What we We n’t expect was the sheer level of unruly chaos that the protesters brought , or that so many of them the protesters be able to make it into the audience . We We n’t expect them the protesters cover themselves the protesters the building and others in red paint to protest some vague idea of Milo Milo " hateful . " They the protesters misinformed , if at all informed , on Milo Milo stances , and they the protesters incredibly unwise in their the protesters of action . The event was obviously a huge success . The protests brought even larger publicity , and there were at least a thousand people milling about Scott Hall last night . Fans , protesters , police , the press . An admin from KnowYourMeme even showed up . Milo Milo’s shouted over a bunch , which was unfortunate , but it An admin from KnowYourMeme served to just prove exactly the purpose of his Milo’s : modern leftism is poisoning debate and thought at universities . You ca n’t even bring a harmless gay man to speak without an enormous shouting match erupting . Black Lives Matter will not benefit from this appearance , just like they Black Lives Matter not benefit from their Black Lives Matter exhibition at the Dartmouth library . People are going to see them People the vitriolic hate group they People —   they People assaulting people , harassing people , vandalizing the walls and floors . " " We ’re going to see a lot of people intellectually disowning BLM after this event . So , yes Milo at Rutgers was a huge leap for free speech and for challenging progressivism on university campuses .
