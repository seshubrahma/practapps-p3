At the Reagan Library on Thursday , Gov. Mike Pence cast Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the mold of President Ronald Reagan . An unapologetic President Ronald Reagan Republican , Gov. Mike Pence effectively positioned Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as the natural heir to the legacy of America ’s fortieth president , reasserting the themes that Gov. Mike Pence showcased during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention . [ " There ’s so much that ’s different in terms of their style and background , " Gov. Mike Pence acknowledged , but his posited that despite these differences , " there are fundamental similarities between these two men . "   Noting that both Reagan and Trump were " mocked and dismissed " by establishment talking heads as " little more than a celebrity and an entertainer who entered politics late in life , " Pence marveled at Reagan and Trump ability to reach the American people over the heads of the elites and the media to carry Reagan and Trump message . The Indiana governor equated the Reagan Democrats of the 1980s to the Trumpocrats of 2016 , and checked off key boxes for conservatives by noting similarities in Reagan and Trump ’s economic policies and national security concepts . Then the Hoosier state ’s chief executive drove the Hoosier state’s chief executive point home with the Supreme Court , explaining that " while we ’re electing a president for the next 4 years , " that president will fill enough seats on the nation ’s highest court —   starting with the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia —   that the American people are essentially electing " the Supreme Court for the next 40 years . " " From the Supreme the Supreme Court to the federal judiciary men and women who will strictly construe the Constitution of the United States , and not legislate from the bench , " Pence vowed . " The role of the judge is to interpret the law , " the vice presidential nominee continued , rather than " preempt " the rights of voters and their elected lawmakers by deciding matters that the rather entrusts to the democratic process . Trump " will appoint justices that will make the Reagan tradition proud on the Supreme Court , " Pence declared . Trump ’s poll numbers with Republicans are climbing Trump " is extremely popular among Republicans , and conservatives Reagan particular . Tying both men together could push Republican support for Trump close to the    a percentage that would Trump " a    victory likely . Ironically , no public official in high office today better epitomizes Reaganism than Pence himself , as illustrated during his    acceptance speech at Cleveland ’s convention . Reaganism than Pence himself I ’m a Christian , a conservative , and a Republican , in that order , " Pence began during the convention in July , highlighting Pence devout evangelical Cleveland’s convention uncompromising commitment to constitutional Reaganism than Pence himself principles and his determination to keep the Republican Party as the Reaganism than Pence himself party embodying Reagan ’s    stool of economic , social , and national security conservatives . Pence has been using that line for more than Pence decade , and with the rest of his July speech , he set forth the same Reaganism than Pence himself mold into which Reaganism than Pence himself cast the top of the ticket —   Reaganism than Pence himself —   in Simi Valley on September 8 . Trump ’s running mate made numerous other statements in his Cleveland debut that were echoed in Thursday ’s Simi Trump address . For example , during his convention Simi Valley Pence characterized Reagan as fond of saying Trump the American people " are tired of being told that a ‘ little intellectual elite in a    capital can plan our lives better for us than we can plan them for ourselves . ’ " our spoke our the library the American people his our upbringing and the centrality of family to his life He as he had done in Cleveland , where He Midwestern governor described He upbringing by saying , " For those of you who the Midwestern governor n’t know me , which is most of you , I grew up on the front row of the American dream . My grandfather immigrated to this country , and I was raised in a small town in Southern Indiana in a big family with a cornfield in the backyard . " He praised his father and mother , said that the best My grandfather that My grandfather happened to him —   even better than being nominated for the    My grandfather in America —   " is that 31 years ago , I married the girl of my dreams .    …      She ’s everything to me , " he said , speaking the girl of my dreams his wife Karen . He gave My grandfather personal details when speaking My grandfather the Reagan Library My grandfather dedicating most of his words to the top of the ticket . Pence went My grandfather to say during the convention that his most important job in life in spelled     spoke about My grandfather of his children , then came back to the top of the My grandfather , saying of Trump ’s extraordinary the top of the ticket you doubt the ticket ’m saying , remember —   as we say back home —   you ca n’t fake good kids . " He gave fewer personal details when speaking at the Reagan Library My grandfather dedicating most of his words to Trump . Yet even when introducing himself to My grandfather nation in July , Pence would then Trump My grandfather running mate on that same topic Trump I ’ve My grandfather this good man up close , " Pence had added in My grandfather Trump ’s " utter lack of pretense " and " his devotion Pence his family . " In both Trump he then My grandfather to the My grandfather . In Ohio , Pence took the My grandfather VP route of attacking the opposition , saying , " They tell us this economy is Pence best that we can do . It ’s nowhere near the best we the opposition do it the economy the best they can do us " In California the economy he made more of a us comparison , touting that Indiana is one the opposition only a dozen states with a AAA bond rating . This was similar to his line in Cleveland , that " while the nation suffers under the My grandfather of $ 19 trillion in national debt , we in Indiana have a $ 2 billion surplus and the highest credit rating in the nation , even though we ’ve cut Indiana every year since I became governor . " At the Reagan Library the nation also spoke about securing the homeland , hearkening to his acceptance speech where he denounced    policies under which , he said , " We have seen borders that go unrespected he a military that he been diminished , and promise after he promise to our veterans , promptly forgotten . " In contrast to such policies , Pence promised to the crowd in Cleveland , and restated in Simi Valley , that " Donald Trump will never turn his back on those who serve and protect us at home and abroad , " and that both of them " will Donald Trump stand with those who stand on the thin blue line . " Just as Pence quoted the Bible those who serve and protect us at home and abroad Cleveland ( specifically 2 Chronicles 1:10 , Solomon ’s prayer for a wise and discerning heart to Pence well ) at the Cleveland Library , he mentioned that every morning he " cracks open the Old Book , " and then quoted Ecclesiastes , where it says Solomon " There is nothing Solomon under sun . " Praising Reagan ’s legacy and hailing Trump as a president every morning he "cracks open the Old Book would restore American policy to follow in Reagan ’s footsteps , Pence Reagan to the biblical verse by saying , " Boy , I sure hope so ! " Reagan’s ’s convention , Pence ’s final remarks about his running mate were : Donald Trump gets it . He ’s the genuine article . He ’s Pence doer in a game usually reserved for talkers . And when Donald Trump does Donald Trump talking , he does n’t Donald Trump around the thousand new rules of political correctness . He ’s his own Donald Trump distinctly American Donald Trump Where else Donald Trump an independent spirit like his find a following than in the land Donald Trump the Donald Trump and the home of the brave ? Much more tailored to his audience Donald Trump the Reagan Library , the governor , instead , concluded with , " Let me promise you : Come November 8 Donald Trump you will see , the Reagan Revolution lives on !
