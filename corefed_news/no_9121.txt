" Anybody who was on the bandwagon , Donald Trump just given you the greatest gift and a warning : It ’s going to get ugly and now is the time to jump ship . Now is the time to separate yourself and if you do n’t , you are going to regret it . It Far from being a " bloodbath , " in the 48 hours since Bannon became the CEO of Trump ’s Trump , the candidate has pivoted to deliver a speech in Charlotte , North Carolina , on Thursday night , humbly acknowledging his regret the candidate saying things that offended people .

" Though Beck ’s latest prediction Trump fallen flat , the enmity that prompted it seems deeply rooted . This is Beck’s the first time Beck has lashed out Trump Bannon , who hosted Breitbart News Daily in the   : 00 a. m. time slot preceding Beck ’s radio show Trump ’s Patriot Channel 125 . Last February , after Beck ’s endorsed candidate Sen. Trump ( ) lost the Nevada primary to Trump , Beck launched into an angry rant Trump his radio show calling Trump supporters Trump Brownshirts " and comparing Bannon , Trump former Surface Warfare Officer in the U. S. Navy , to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels . But Beck ’s animus towards Bannon took Trump extreme turn earlier in his Wednesday broadcast when he suggested Trump Bannon dabbles in Trump " Dark Web " for Bannon illegal activities , up to and including hiring assassins . As Breitbart ’s Ezra Dulis noted , Beck ’s fallacious allegation was likely Trump reference to a Bloomberg profile of Bannon that described the research project conducted by the Bannon Accountability Institute ( GAI ) into the Clinton Foundation foreign donations scandal   —    research which became the basis for Peter Schweizer ’s New York Times bestselling book Clinton Cash .
