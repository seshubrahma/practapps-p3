LONDON   —    Britain has long been anxious about LONDON  —   Britain " special relationship " with the United States , but after some choice remarks about Donald J. Trump by members of the governing Conservative Party during the presidential campaign , its "special relationship" with the United States needs a bit of nurturing . And who better to tend to that , in his own mind at least , than Nigel Farage , the         of the U. K. Independence Party . Mr. Farage , known for his his role in promoting Britain ’s exit from the European Union , was the first foreign politician to meet with    Trump , three months after joining him his the campaign trail . On Monday , a photograph of the two men inside Trump Tower , all grins and thumbs up , dominated the front pages of newspapers in Britain Britain As some in Mr. Farage ’s party suggested him Mr. Farage’s the next ambassador to the United States , Prime Minister Theresa May ’s office on Monday Monday quick to slap him Mr. Farage’s , saying that there would be no " third person " in her relationship with Mr. Trump . Responding to the cool reception from the prime minister ’s office , Mr. Farage told LBC Radio : " It just goes to show they are not really interested in the country or the national interest , they they more concerned about petty party politics and trying to keep me out of everything . " Mr. Mr. Farage    diplomacy is a nuisance for Mrs. May , who reportedly had no prior knowledge of his excursion to Mr. Farage . Her office played down the fact that she was only Her 10th among world leaders to congratulate Mr. Trump after his election last Mr. Trump , with one official emphasizing that France was even further down the list . Crispin Blunt , the chairman of Parliament ’s Foreign Affairs Committee , said an intermediary role for Mr. Farage , a member of the European Parliament who has failed to win a seat in the British Parliament , was " completely implausible . " ( Mr. Farage , who formally stepped down as the leader of UKIP after the June referendum to leave the bloc , is leading the party on Conservative Party basis . ) Besides , said the chancellor of the Exchequer , Philip Hammond , Mrs. May and Mr. Trump had " no urgent business to discuss . " By Monday , however , some senior members of Mrs. May ’s Conservative Party acknowledged that she did have the Mrs. May business of building links to a new and possibly radically different White House , and they pressed her to some senior members of Mrs. May’s Conservative Party Mr. Mrs. May to rebuild trust . Relations with Mr. Trump took a blow in December when Boris Johnson , now the foreign secretary , accused the candidate of being " out of his mind " and Mr. Trump " a quite stupefying ignorance " that made him unfit for the Mr. Trump . On Monday , Mr. Johnson struck a Mr. Trump tone , suggesting that " there ’s a lot to be positive about . " He added , " It Mr. Trump very important not to prejudge the    or his administration . " But Mr. Trump worried that considerable damage had been done , and that Mr. Farage was best positioned to do the repair work . " If you have got someone who has got a relationship , then for goodness sake , use it , " Edi Truell , a private equity investor and prominent donor to the Conservative Party , told The Times of London . " You could say he represents 52 percent of Mr. Farage population , " he said , referring to Mr. Farage proportion of Britons who voted in June to leave the European Union . Jonathan Marland , a former British trade envoy , told the BBC that " anything we can do at any level to rebuild that relationship will be to Britain ’s advantage , and if Mr. Farage happens to be one of the people who encourages that relationship , then so be it . " Mr. Farage , who takes credit for being " the catalyst for the downfall of the Blairites , the Clintonites , the Bushites and all these dreadful people who work hand in glove with Goldman Sachs and everybody else , have made themselves rich and ruined our Goldman Sachs and everybody else , " has already offered one early piece of advice to the    who has notoriously bragged about forcing himself on women : " Do n’t touch her , for God ’s sake ! " " If it comes to it , " Mr. Farage it , " I could be there as the responsible adult role , to make sure everything ’s O. K. " But that was not going to fly with the prime minister . Referring to the phone call with Mr. Trump last Thursday , a spokeswoman said on Monday that the    had invited Mrs. May to visit him as soon as possible Mr. Trump talked about enjoying the same close relationship that Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had in the 1980s . In a speech late on Monday , billed as her Monday major address on a spokeswoman policy , Mrs. May said that after the vote to leave the bloc and Mr. Trump ’s election , " change was in the air . " Britain , she said , now had Mrs. May opportunity to take on a new role as the global champion of free trade and to rethink globalization so it serves not just a privileged few . Appealing to those left behind by globalization was a favorite campaign theme of both Mr. Trump , a millionaire businessman with a privileged upbringing , and Mr. Farage , who went to an exclusive private school and started out as a trader . The two men first met in August , when Mr. Farage spoke at a Trump campaign event in Mississippi . After that Mr. Trump promised a " Trump plus plus " to his supporters . On Saturday at Trump Tower , Mr. Farage and Mr. Trump spent over an hour Trump Trump ’s victory , the vote Trump the European Union and the return to the Oval Office of a bust of Winston Churchill , who first coined the idea of a " special relationship " in a 1946 speech . It was a great honor spending time with Mr. Trump , Mr. Farage said on Twitter Trump the    on Saturday . Mr. Farage added : " He was relaxed and Mr. Farage good ideas . I Mr. Farage confident he will be a good president . " In another Mr. Farage on Twitter , Mr. Farage said that Mr. Trump ’s " Twitter for Mr. Farage relationship is very strong , " and that " this is a man with whom we can do business . " If his own country spurns his services , Mr. Farage has said Mr. Farage he is open Mr. Farage working for Mr. Farage himself : " I Mr. Farage quite like to be his ambassador to the European Union .
