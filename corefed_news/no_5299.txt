"   former Clinton administration Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said , " Right now , there is a disconnect , George , between a rather sclerotic Democratic apparatus which is in complete disarray . I mean the Democratic Party has not been in this bad this bad shape 1920 ’s and a huge uprising at the grassroots , mostly against Trump . How can Tom Perez , can he actually utilize that Tom Perez turn the Democratic the Democratic Party vast    machine into a movement ? " " Has n’t been done before very easily . you remember in the Vietnam war days , we had a huge uprising . but the Democratic Party had the Democratic Party with that .
