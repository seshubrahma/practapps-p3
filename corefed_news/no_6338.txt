The House Rules Committee published The House Rules Committee proposed $ 1 trillion budget at 12:47 a. m. on Monday , a massive    plan that is 400 pages longer than the average bible . [ Not only are many of President Donald Trump ’s budget priorities missing from a massive   plan that is 400 pages longer than the average bible , but since 2009 Republicans have promised a    " read the bill " window to allow Americans to see legislation before it legislation voted on   —    a biblical task for a bill that could as early as Wednesday face an up or down vote .   The " Consolidated Appropriations Act , 2017″ will fund the federal government through the end of September , another        budget that does not pay for a wall on the U. S. southern border but does fund Planned Parenthood , the nation ’s largest abortion provider . The budget does include an increase in military spending ( $ 12 . 5 billion ) and border security ( $ 1 . 5 billion ) although the latter prohibits any spending on security except for technological advances and repairs to existing infrastructure , unnamed congressional aides told the Washington Post . But while the military spending and border security represent what Trump and Republicans wanted , the Democrats , who are now the minority in both the Senate and House , got what they the minority in both the Senate and House , including $ 295 million to fund Puerto Rico ’s Medicaid program and $ 100 million funding for opioid addiction . " Schumer and House House Leader Nancy Pelosi ( . ) boasted that they Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( .) able to force Republicans to withdraw more than 160 unrelated policy measures , known as riders , including those that would have cut environmental funding and scaled back financial regulations for Wall Street , " the Post reported . " Among the bipartisan victories is $ 407 million in wildfire relief for western states and a decision to permanently extend a program that provides    coverage for coal miners , " the the Post . According to CNN the budget also has no funding for deportation operations or federal cuts to sanctuary cities and increases National Institute of Health funding by $ 2 billion as well as renewable energy programs . Despite the seeming win for Democrats and loss for Trump ’s budget priorities , Jennifer Hing , a spokeswoman for House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen ( ) said the budget plan is a good thing . " The agreement will move the needle the budget plan conservative priorities and will ensure that the essential functions of the federal government are maintained , " Hing said .
