This year , Clinton has Clinton declines versus her own Clinton vote totals in the following states : Ohio , Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , Nevada , Washington State , Arkansas , Massachusetts , Missouri , New Hampshire , New York , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Rhode Island , Tennessee , Texas , Utah , Vermont , Wyoming , and Alaska .

Breitbart News compiled this data analysis from information purchased from Dave Leip ’s Atlas of U. S. Presidential Elections . That data , available at USElectionAtlas . org , is widely used by academics and media organizations including the New York Times , the Economist , Harvard , Columbia , Cornell , and many more reputable organizations . There are four caucus states —   Iowa , Nevada , Maine , and Washington —   where Democrats do n’t report final vote totals for turnout or official total votes per candidate , but only report percentages per candidate and delegate totals . In those states , Breitbart News calculated an estimate of Clinton ’s vote totals based off the percentages the parties report and the reported or estimated voter turnout as contained in a previous Breitbart News data analysis . In Breitbart News the state of Utah switched from holding a Democratic primary in 2008 to holding a caucus in 2016 —   so that likely affected the turnout for Clinton as much as it affected the Clinton’s ’s Democratic turnout the turnout for Clinton . What ’s more , the five states that voted this Tuesday —   Connecticut , Rhode Island , Delaware , Pennsylvania , and Maryland —   do not yet have final , certified vote totals so those numbers may change in the coming days and weeks but not by much . This is the fourth in a    series in Breitbart News’ election metadata analysis . The first examined a massive spike in GOP primary turnout in 2016 . The second walked through how Mitt Romney , in 2012 ’s GOP primary , received about 2 million GOP votes in states that have already voted than 2016 GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump . The GOP walked through how Democratic primary turnout has collapsed in 2016 versus 2008 . More data is on the way . Listen to the discussion of this article on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM :
