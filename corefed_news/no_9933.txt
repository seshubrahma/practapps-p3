Sunday on NBC ’s " Meet The Press , " actor George Clooney said Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz ( ) were running campaigns based on fear .   actor George Clooney said , " I met him once , sitting down at a table . It was nice and we talked a couple of times , I think . And then him went on Larry King and told everybody I was very short . No , I met you sitting down . But it ’s not about that . You know , here ’s the point about what ’s going on right now on the other side . Trump and Cruz are making this a campaign of fear . we have to be afraid of everything . we have to be afraid of refugees . we have to be afraid of Muslims . we have to be afraid of minorities . And the question is , and this is an important one , are we really going to be scared of the very things that have made our country great ? And if the answer is yes , then we have history to answer to . Because we ’re not afraid . we are not a country   —    we are not a country that is afraid . And I refuse to accept that .
