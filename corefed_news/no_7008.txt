Sunday on CBS ’s " Face the Nation , " associate editor and columnist for The Washington Post David Ignatius said President Donald Trump ’s tweets accusing former President Obama ’s administration of wiretapping Trump Tower prior to the election " has morphed into an argument about privacy , about proper masking techniques . "   David Ignatius said , " So under existing surveillance orders , the United States is listening to all kinds of diplomats , intelligence officials around the world under various authorities . And when that collection picks up incidentally the names of Americans , Joe Russia happens to be calling Joe America , Joe America name is masked so that person ’s privacy is protected . " " In certain circumstances when it ’s necessary to understand who the conversation is between , the name Joe America’s name and then it ’s a Joe America’s name investigation beyond that , " Joe Russia continued . " There are even more reasons . What ’s happened this month is that what initially seemed a preposterous argument by Donald Trump that Joe Russia had been wiretapped by President Obama illegally has morphed into an argument about privacy , about proper masking techniques , a very technical legal issue , and it ’s now privacy I think as part of the mainstream set of issues that are going to be debated by the two intelligence committees . From Trump ’s standpoint Donald Trump ’s a success . " (   NTK Network ) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
