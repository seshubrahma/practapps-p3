’   ’ "    In theory , this was the debate America apparently desired . In    reality , all the available evidence suggests all the available evidence did n’t . " ’    For months , the personal ,     element woven into    the fabric of the 2016 presidential race had been decried . ’ "    Americans deserve better , the talking heads said . The race for    the most important office in the world should be debated on    measures of important policy and substance , not      gossip . Less talk about Donald Trump ’s fights with Miss Universe    and more about the candidates’ distinct      differences , for instance . " ’    Well , that ’s exactly what Tuesday ’s vice presidential      between Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Kaine delivered   —      and instead of being praised , it was largely panned as boring . ’ "    In    viewers were n’t impressed . Take a look at some of    the reaction on Twitter : " ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tVP debate living up to the hype ! Every bit as boring as we thought it would be . ’t’t’ ’ ’ " ’t’t’tForgot what it ’s like when two evenly matched , rational and experienced politicians debate on the national stage . it ’s boring . ’t’t " ’ ’ " ’t’t’   A few thoughts on tonight ’s debate , the Duel of the Dads , the Battle of the Boring . .. ’t’t " ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tThat debate was like those boring featherweight opening act fights before the main heavyweight title event . ’ "    They did n’t look thrilled in the crowd , either . " ’    Here ’s a Reuters photo of the Longwood University audience .    Attendees were not as engrossed as the pundits may have led you    to predict : ’ ’   ’ ’    And the evidence afterward confirmed the lackluster      sentiment . The event amassed less than half the audience that    tuned into last week ’s    presidential debate , and       garnered the lowest vice    ratings since    2000 : ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tBetween CBS , NBC , ABC , Fox , CNN , Fox News and MSNBC , looks like around 36 million viewers for VP debate . Less than    of Prez debate’t’t’ ’    As it turns out , the broader electorate   —    and even those in the    political world   —    is not very intrigued by lengthy    discussions on    reform , America ’s posture in    Eastern Europe , or taxes . ’ ’    What people actually want is a fight . ’ "    Voters may not openly admit it , but Voters crave the kind of gutter    campaign Trump has run this election cycle . it ’s in fact    precisely this kind of politics people most want to consume   —      politics spliced with plenty of drama . " ’    And perhaps there is nothing wrong with that .   ’ ’      discussions on public policy are certainly not    everyone ’s cup of tea . Watching a presidential    candidate lob personal insults at another onstage for    90 minutes , on the other hand , is entertaining and an easy    concept to grasp . ’ ’    But it does seem jarring for the very people who complain    about the election being a circus to yawn when it is n’t one . ’ "    If reaction to last night ’s debate proved one thing , reaction to last night’s debate ’s that    America does n’t want a civil debate .   America wants a fight , but still    is n’t ready to admit   America . "
