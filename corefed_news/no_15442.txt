  ( CNN ) Former FBI Director James Comey , who was fired Tuesday by President Donald Trump , on Wednesday sent a letter to select FBI staff , friends and agents . Here is the text of a letter to select FBI staff, friends and agents . To all : I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI Director for any reason , or for no reason at all . I ’m not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed . I hope you wo n’t either . It is done , and I will it fine , although I will miss you and the mission deeply . I have said to you before that , in times of turbulence , the American people should see FBI as a rock of competence , honesty , and independence . What makes leaving the FBI is the nature and quality of its people FBI who together make it that rock for America . It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing . My hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution . If you do that , you too will be sad when you leave , and the American people will be safer . Working with the American people one of the great joys of my life . Thank you for that gift . Jim Comey
