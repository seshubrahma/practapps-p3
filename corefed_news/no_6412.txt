His Eminence Timothy Cardinal Dolan , archbishop of New York , was a guest on Thursday ’s Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM , where His offered a preview of His speech for the upcoming March for Life in Washington , D. C.["The    march in Washington , which usually occurs on January 22   —    which is the somber anniversary of Roe v. Wade in 1973   —    this year , as you know Alex , it got pushed back because of all the celebrations of the inaugural , " Alex told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow . " So we ’re doing it tomorrow , uniquely , this year . "   LISTEN : " This has been going on since 1974 and , classically , Alex Alex can get up to     people , " he Alex , adding that despite its enormous size , it its never receives any coverage . " " I was thinking of that last week , last Saturday , with the women ’s march throughout the nation , which undeniably got a lot of attention , " he Alex . " I thought , wow , we bring in hundreds and hundreds of thousands annually , at the coldest time of the year in Washington , D. C. with people coming from all over the country , and it the country n’t get much attention . " " This gives us we lot of hope , Alex , " Cardinal Dolan said . " Every year , we we more and more people . Every year , we we younger people , who seem to just know in their gut that something is wrong with the culture of death that has gripped our we country , that was built upon the inalienable right to life . Every year , you ’ve got more and more people that stand up   —    as Jews , as Christians , as men and women of no religion , or any religion at all . "   " Most of all , though , as Americans who want to reclaim the constitutional right to the sacredness of life . and the dignity of the human person , and to reclaim the constitutional rights that everybody , the civil rights especially , of the most fragile , innocent form of life now under attack   —    namely the baby in the womb , " he the human person . " What ’s happened , Alex , over the last 40 years or so , is that this has become a    or a    advocacy and celebration of life , " he the human person . " So for instance , as you were kind enough to hint at , this evening , I ’ll have the honor of 5:30 Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception , which is there in northeast Washington on the campus of the Catholic University of America . There , there will be thousands and thousands of people who will be there all day today , all night tonight , all day tomorrow , up until the March , in prayer and in fellowship . "   " Tonight tonight there will be a magnificent mass , which I have the honor of being the principal celebrant and the homilist   —    only , Alex , not because of any talent of mine , but because I happen to have been entrusted by my brother bishops as chair of the Bishops’ Committee on    Activities , " he Alex modestly . " This happy responsibility will fall to me . So we ’ve got that tonight . "   " We we have numbers of gatherings and masses tomorrow morning , prior to the March . I ’ll meet with a couple of thousand young people coming   —    get this !   —    all the way from Bismarck , North Dakota , from a wonderful university called the University of Mary . They ’ve asked me to have mass for them They joined by hundreds of our marchers from New York , and my niece Gracie ’s school coming from St. Louis . We ’ll have mass . We We go to the March , " he Gracie’s .   " Friday night , they have the annual Rose Dinner , which gathers    leadership from around the country , and I have the honor of giving the keynote at that . So you ’re getting my point , Alex : this becomes really almost 48 hours of advocacy , witness , and celebration of life . It this become a real shot in the arm for    people who   —    look , naturally , logically , they people who  —    kind of discouraged in this aggressive culture of death that we ’ve got , " Cardinal Dolan acknowledged . Marlow posited that the long process of " normalizing " even the most extreme    positions appears to have reversed , and the    movement is one of the few conservative social movements to experience dramatic growth . " No doubt about it ! " Dolan Cardinal Dolan agreed . " What you ’ve got is the isolated chic Left seem to be in total denial that there ’s a strong    sentiment in the country . I think you may have seen   —    it just came out a day or two ago from Marist College Marist College has a sterling reputation for very impartial professional     —    they very impartial professional    —    done a poll on the whole    terrain , to find out that 76 percent of the American people are opposed to unfettered access to abortion . 76 percent of our the country that there needs to be genuine restrictions on the abortion license . " " Now , I have to admit to be fair here , there ’s some sobering news in that study , too , " he continued . " It does say that a majority of Americans do want to keep abortion legal . But boy , that is really tempered by their beliefs a majority of Americans do want to keep abortion legal government should not pay for it , that it should it be done in rare circumstances , and that it needs it be restricted so the life of the unborn baby is always given favor and protection . That ’s extraordinarily good news . It seems to be snickered at by those in academia , those in journalism , those in Hollywood , and even those in the political arena . " " This is an issue , Alex , that will not go away , " he declared Alex " Every year , of course , our opponents who are    and very popular , and who have access to a lot of prestigious support , every year , they say our opponents who are   and very popular, and who have access to a lot of prestigious support is over , and the    are the extremists . It ’s this more and more clear , Alex , Alex the real extremists are the   . They are the real extremists ones that will not allow any dialogue at all . They are the real extremists ones who will not allow absolutely any consideration of any restriction on the abortion license , even something as hideous and nauseating as    abortion . Absolutely not . We do not talk about it . We will We consider it . it is the kind of      extremist party , namely the   . " " I was just listening to your show before I came on . You were talking about extraordinarily doable and thoughtful alternatives to abortion . They do abortion want to have any dialogue about that stuff , " he declared .   " And now , as you just said , at least we used We be united in somewhat of an abhorrence for abortion . Even the most rabid    used to say , ‘ Hey , we dread abortion . We wish we did abortion have to happen . We dread we . abortion ’ll we anything we can we stop it , abortion darn it , abortion needs abortion remain legal as a last resort.’ Now ? Are you kidding ? They ’re celebrating it : abortion Abortion is a virtue . Sometimes , abortion is a necessity . It should abortion paid for . Everybody should be entitled to it.’ We have we completely to the other extreme , and I think that recognition is really a booster shot to the    movement in the country , " Dolan said . Marlow noted that Dolan has Dolan President Trump ’s border and immigration policies , while praising his restoration President Trump’s the Mexico City Policy , which effectively reduces federal funding for abortion programs overseas . He asked Marlow the Cardinal ’s assessment of President Trump President Trump’s week overall . Dolan replied Dolan he is Dolan President Trump will President Trump’s more    initiatives while the March for Life is in progress , including the termination of " previous executive orders that only gave aid and comfort to the abortionists . " " We do , as he is hopeful President Trump will announce even more   initiatives while the March for Life is in progress, including the termination of "previous executive orders that only gave aid and comfort to the abortionists said , have reason to celebrate , and that one of the first things the new President did is to restore what President Ronald Reagan had done back in 1984 in saying that , look , just as we in the United he is hopeful President Trump will announce even more   initiatives while the March for Life is in progress, including the termination of "previous executive orders that only gave aid and comfort to the abortionists are blessed with the Hyde Amendment , which restricts any of the people ’s money and taxes to go to pay for abortion , so we ’re going to restrict the people of the United States , the United States they give in money and taxes to go to pay for abortion , for money and taxes to go to pay for abortion used for abortion in our international aid , " he we . " Hallelujah for money and taxes to go to pay for abortion . Thanks be to God . That ’s an extraordinarily sane , thoughtful , prudent gesture that has become a ping pong ball , depending on which administration it is . That President Trump would restore President Reagan ’s initiative restricting international aid to abortion from the United States , that can the United States , " he said . " We look for more President Trump gestures . " Dolan recalled Dolan the Obama administration used federal money to muscle which administration Relief Services into providing abortion services and abortifacients , or else forfeit grants that would help them perform services for women which they indisputably excelled at groups like Catholic Relief Services " This is an ideology groups like Catholic Relief Services and this is an intrusion , and this is a handcuffing This international aid organizations that is This counterproductive and downright unjust , " he declared . " Thanks be to God now , that straitjacket has been removed God the extraordinarily effective religious relief organizations in international aid . " " This is looking good , Alex Alex and we look for even better things to come . We want to keep our eye on the appointment of we Supreme Court justice we We want to keep our eye on the reform of we Affordable Care Act our eye make sure that the hideous parts of it that many people , like the Bishops of the United the reform of the Affordable Care Act , have pointed to , the United States be cleansed , " he said . " In the Psalms , we pray , ‘ Put not your trust in princes,’ " Cardinal we noted Dolan we laugh . " That ’s what the inspired authors tell , I guess with the voice of God . Today we ’d probably say , ‘ Put God your trust in politicians’ we we ’re going to be disappointed by any political leader . " we We applauded a lot of things that Barack Obama did , as we . We found fault with a Obama other things that he did , we he pointed out . " Odds are the same is going to be true he the new President . the new President you a reason why we ’re applauding him now .
