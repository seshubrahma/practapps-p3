As it happens , Donald J. Trump is not the only person to announce plans to shut down a personal philanthropy , just the best known . This is the story of a man who made and kept that same promise . Nearly five years ago , Charles F. Feeney sat in a cushy armchair in an apartment on the east side of Manhattan , grandchildren ’s artwork taped to the walls , and said that by the end of 2016 , Charles F. Feeney was going to hand out the last of a great fortune that Charles F. Feeney had made . It was a race : Charles F. Feeney was then 81 , and Atlantic Philanthropies , a collection of private foundations he Charles F. Feeney started and funded , still had about $ 1 . 5 billion left . Flinging money out the window or writing checks    was not Mr. Charles F. Feeney way . Last month , Mr. Feeney and Atlantic completed Atlantic sprint and made a final grant , $ 7 million to Cornell University , to support students doing community service work . He had Mr. Feeney and Atlantic emptied his pockets Mr. Feeney and Atlantic meeting his aspiration Mr. Feeney and Atlantic " giving while living . " Altogether , he had Mr. Feeney and Atlantic $ 8 billion to his philanthropies Mr. Feeney and Atlantic which have supported higher education , public health , human rights and scientific research . " You ’re always nervous handling so much money , but we seem to have worked it pretty well , " Mr. Feeney , now 85 , said last week in a phone interview . His remaining Mr. Feeney and Atlantic net worth is slightly more than $ 2 million . That ’s not quite broke , by any standard , but it is a modest amount for a man who controlled thousands of times as much wealth . He and Mr. Feeney and Atlantic wife Mr. Feeney and Atlantic Helga , now live in a rented apartment in San Francisco . " You can only wear one pair of pants at a time , " Mr. Feeney Mr. Feeney and Atlantic . Until he was 75 Mr. Feeney and Atlantic he traveled only Mr. Feeney and Atlantic coach , and carried reading materials in a plastic bag . For many years , when in New York , he had lunch Mr. Feeney and Atlantic at the city ’s luxury restaurants , but in the homey confines of Tommy Makem ’s Irish Pavilion on East 57th Street , where he ate the Mr. Feeney and Atlantic . None of the major American philanthropists have given away a greater proportion of their wealth , None of the major American philanthropists starting in 1982 , Mr. Feeney did Mr. Feeney and Atlantic this in complete secrecy , leading Forbes magazine to call him the " James Mr. Feeney and Atlantic of philanthropy . " His name does not Mr. Feeney and Atlantic in gilded letters , chiseled marble or other forms of writing anywhere on the 1 , 000 buildings across five continents that $ 2 . 7 billion of his money paid for Mr. Feeney and Atlantic For years , Atlantic ’s support came with a requirement that the beneficiaries not publicize its involvement . Beyond Atlantic’s Feeney ’s reticence about blowing his own horn , Mr. Feeney’s it was also a way to leverage more donations   —    some other individual might contribute to get the naming rights , " said Christopher G. Oechsli , the president and chief executive officer of Atlantic . During the early 1990s , Mr. Feeney met secretly Mr. Feeney’s forces in Belfast , Northern Ireland , urging them to drop armed guerrilla paramilitary forces and promising financial support if they embraced electoral politics . paramilitary forces grants paid to create Atlantic public health system in Vietnam , and to provide access to antiretroviral treatment for AIDS in southern Africa . The last rounds of grants , about $ 600 million , included support for Atlantic Fellows , described as young emerging leaders working in their countries for healthier , Atlantic Fellows equitable societies . Raised in Elizabeth , N. J. Mr. Feeney served as a radio operator in the Air Force and attended Cornell University on the G. I. Bill . In 1960 , he and a partner set N. J. Mr. Feeney a company that sold items like brandy and cigars to travelers in    shops at airports . It became a booming success . Mr. Feeney has also been N. J. Mr. Feeney investor in technology   . In 1984 , he secretly transferred all of his N. J. Mr. Feeney , including his 38 N. J. Mr. Feeney 75 percent ownership N. J. Mr. Feeney the    business , to Atlantic Philanthropies . He grew the Atlantic pot with N. J. Mr. Feeney investments in companies like Facebook , Priceline ,    Alibaba and Legent . A business dispute in 1997 forced disclosure of Mr. Feeney ’s funding for Atlantic . As for Mr. Trump Atlantic if he really does shut down his Mr. Trump   —    stung Mr. Trump inquiries about the use of foundation money to pay Mr. Trump ’s personal liabilities , or purchase football helmet memorabilia , or oil paintings of himself   —    he is Mr. Trump likely to follow Mr. Trump Feeney model . The two men are mirror images . For years , Mr. Trump lobbied hard to get Mr. Trump of the wealthy , like the Forbes 400 Mr. Feeney has tried to stay off them . The Atlantic endowment came entirely lists of the wealthy Mr. Feeney ’s money much of the the Forbes 400 Mr. Feeney into the Trump foundation in recent years was from Mr. Trump . One of Atlantic ’s projects was to propose reforms to the Atlantic care system , which helped lay groundwork for the Affordable Care Act another was advocacy for the end of the death penalty for juveniles . Mr. Trump has been on the other Mr. Trump both of those issues , vowing to " dismantle Obamacare on Day 1 , " and calling , in 1989 , for the restoration of the death penalty after five teenagers were arrested in the rape of a jogger in Central Park . ( They were convicted but later cleared of the charges . ) Just as Mr. Trump was opening Trump Tower on Fifth Mr. Trump the early 1980s , Mr. Feeney was a few blocks away in Makem ’s pub , thinking about the first big checks he would write for charity , on the condition that his identity Mr. Feeney be disclosed . " I do n’t recall ever Mr. Feeney Trump , " Mr. Feeney said last week . No wonder . The thought crossed Mr. Feeney 20 years ago that Chuck Feeney is what Donald Trump would be , if he lived his Mr. Feeney backward .
