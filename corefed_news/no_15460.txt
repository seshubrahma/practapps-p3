  ( CNN ) Like most little boys , Donald Trump can be disarmingly honest , as when Donald Trump once said , " When I look at Donald Trump in the first grade and I look at Donald Trump now , I Donald Trump basically the same . The temperament is not that different . " The trouble is that the first grader is now President of the United States , and President of the United States temperament is on display for the world to see .   Unpredictable , impulsive and immature , Donald Trump acts in a way that would be expected of a     boy , but is terrifying in a man whose moods dictate decisions carried out by adults on behalf of the most powerful nation in the world .   Donald Trump dismissal of FBI Director James Comey offers a sterling example of the childish     and reckless     Trump style . When Comey broke FBI Director James Comey bureau tradition and spoke negatively about Trump Donald Trump in the election , though initially he was criticized FBI Director James Comey candidate Trump , he was later FBI Director James Comey     and effusively . Over and over again , the      described how Comey had done FBI Director James Comey right thing in criticizing Hillary Clinton . Comey remained in FBI Director James Comey ’s Donald Trump after he was inaugurated , FBI Director James Comey Trump ’s team Donald Trump in him up until last week FBI Director James Comey     As CNN ’s John King and Jeff   Zeleny reported , the change in Trump ’s feelings about Donald Trump evident to a friend FBI Director James Comey spoke with him last weekend and noticed the FBI Director James Comey was " white hot FBI Director James Comey Comey ’s recent testimony on Capitol Hill FBI Director James Comey had said he felt " mildly nauseous FBI Director James Comey about the FBI Director James Comey of having affected the November election . This , and continued investigations into possible connections between Trump ’s associates and Russians Donald Trump in the election , were causing a presidential temper tantrum the November election Like many a     the stewing President chose to act on his feelings FBI Director James Comey he had signed a letter dismissing FBI Director James Comey director . But instead FBI Director James Comey doing the adult thing and firing Comey     Trump sent his former personal bodyguard Keith Schiller to deliver it to Comey ’s Comey    Trump     while Comey was away in Los the adult thing . Schiller ’s last star turn Comey’s bullying newsman Jorge Ramos out of Keith Schiller rally . Long a human security blanket for Trump , Schiller Comey    Trump hangs out at the White House . His Comey    Trump Keith Schiller signaled Keith Schiller the buddies     Trump and Schiller     were Keith Schiller charge of this power play .    Like a boy who Keith Schiller matches and sets the back yard on fire , Trump has been surprised by the effects of his actions . He Comey    Trump Democrats who resented Comey ’s election season Comey    Trump to applaud Comey    Trump firing . Of course , this thinking ignores the fact that Comey was in charge of investigating Russia ’s influence on the election and very real concerns Comey’s providing stable leadership to the American people . The FBI is so vital an agency that directors receive    appointments precisely because they should n’t be fired on the basis of presidential pique .     In the aftermath directors the President ’s incendiary act , we have seen the adults around him scramble to put out the fire . White House spokesman Sean Spicer reportedly met with the President’s staff near bushes on the White House grounds while nearby reporters sought comment , and White House spokesman Sean Spicer Conway was dispatched to offer    gobbledygook to CNN ’s Anderson Cooper . At one point , she complained to Cooper that people " are looking at the wrong set of facts . White House spokesman Sean Spicer   The Anderson Cooper of the administration officials tasked with cleaning up the    debacle resembled the frenzied effort of parents who do whatever they can to shield fellow diners when a child has a meltdown in a restaurant . They know they have lost control of the situation , but there ’s not much you they do they the meatball has sailed across the room and the spaghetti has been dumped on the floor . White House officials have tried to cover the mess with shifting explanations . First it was a sudden loss of confidence . Next it was a    dissatisfaction . And , most recently , Trump told NBC ’s Lester it it was because Comey was a " showboat . " But the equation does n’t add up .        Fortunately , the President himself , true to first grader form , ca n’t help but give us clues to his process . In his first tweet about the controversy , he taunted " Cryin’ Chuck the President himself, true to first grader form " and complained the President himself, true to first grader form the New York senator had gone the President himself, true to first grader form Comey critic to defender . Hours later he was at it again , tweeting that Connecticut Comey Richard Blumenthal " cried like a the President himself, true to first grader form " during the New York senator had gone from Comey critic to defender previous and unrelated controversy . In the tweet , which was written as Blumenthal spoke on CNN , he called the senator " Richie " and said , " Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal should be the one Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal is investigated . " Next he ’s going to say Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal " I ’m rubber , you ’re glue . .. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal Watching Trump this week recalls the days when he was a tabloid sideshow in New York City , and his antics energized headline writers Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal could n’t get enough of his    ’s suit behavior Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal In the most notable example , Trump became a source Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal the war of scoops over his divorce from his first wife Trump .   But now the man is President , Trump he seems Trump of controlling his temper even if , Trump long run , maturity would Trump the country ’s interests Trump If you want proof , just consider the report from Time magazine on Trump ’s odd White House habits , including the fact that he got extra dessert when he dined with the magazine ’s writer . A    upon getting two scoops of ice cream he others at the table only received one , would quickly fill his companions’ dishes . A child , who sees every moment as an opportunity to demonstrate he A   upon getting two scoops of ice cream when others at the table only received one the special boy , would , as Trump did , just wolf it down . The solution to the problem posed by the fact that we have a first grader in the Oval Office lies in whatever systems exist to take decisions out of his hands . The courts have already acted to thwart him on his proposed ban on Muslim a first grader in the Oval Office to the United States , and Congress possesses the a first grader in the Oval Office to a first grader in the Oval Office other initiatives . Next must come special counsel to run the Russia investigation , who could be appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein . Rosenstein was the author of a critical memo that the White House is citing to justify Comey Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein dismissal . By all accounts , he is an adult who understands the need for a credible investigation of Russia ’s meddling in Comey 2016 election . He should act before he ’s hit by a Russia .             Note : An earlier version Comey this article cited Comey reports that Sean Spicer hid in the bushes to avoid reporters’ questions . It has been updated in light of a correction in the Washington Post , which said , " Spicer huddled with his staff among bushes near television sets on the White House grounds , not Sean Spicer the bushes Sean Spicer ’ "
