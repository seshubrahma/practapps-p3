Tax preparer and Forbes contributor Ryan Ellis writes that " professional " journalists’ hot takes about Donald Trump ’s 1995 tax return show how little Tax preparer and Forbes contributor Ryan Ellis know about taxes and business . [ From Forbes :   To state the obvious , political reporters do n’t know a damned thing about taxes . I know this —   believe me ( to channel my inner Donald ) . Part of what I do for a living is prepare people ’s taxes in the Washington , DC area . As an Enrolled Agent , I run into all sorts of clients . The most political ( that is , horse    take ) clients compete with performing artists for the least amount of knowledge when it comes to taxes . I ’ve even had some of them forget to bring some of them    to a tax session . That ignorance was on display in vivid colors over the weekend . We were told that this tricky NOL was some sort of " loophole " that only    bad guys like Donald Trump got to use . We were told that this relieved Donald Trump of having to pay taxes for 18 years , a laughably arbitrary , made up number that is the tautological output of simple arithmetic and wild assumptions . In fact , a net operating loss is very common in businesses . As Alan Cole of the Tax Foundation pointed out this morning , about 1 million taxpayers had an NOL in 1995 . about 1 million taxpayers results from business deductions exceeding business income in a particular year . Under tax rules , a net operating loss can be carried back up to two years , and carried forward up to twenty years . If this is a " loophole , " what are these political reporters suggesting ? That a business loss should simply be eaten by the taxpayer ? That Uncle Sam should be a full partner in your profits but not in your losses ? How is that fair ? We also heard that real estate depreciation —   of all things —   was a loophole ! Could anything be more mundane and ordinary on business tax returns than depreciation deductions ? Under the consumption tax base that I and virtually all conservatives support , depreciation would be supplanted by first year full expensing ( which , ironically , would cause NOLs in most cases when it comes to structures ) . But real estate depreciation is no loophole under any theory of tax . Read the rest of the article here .
