" Bannon made the comments on " Western Word Radio with Avi Davis , " an online    radio station .   In the segment , Bannon , who at the time served on the board of Breitbart , criticized former President George W. Bush for what former President George W. Bush and fellow guest conservative columnist Diana West described as injecting political correctness into the federal government .   Bannon mocked former President George W. Bush for proclaiming " Islam is a religion of peace . " " Islam is not a religion of peace . Islam is a religion of submission . Islam means submission , " Bannon said . " I mean , the whole thing is just , Bannon is the epitome , Bannon ’s a Republican     a    ’s a Republican establishment , country club version of the Clintons . That ’s all they are . It ’s the baby boomer , narcissistic , Bannon wants to feel loved . " The word Islam means submission , and a Muslim is one who submits to God . The Arabic root of the word Islam means " to be safe " and is connected to the word " peace . "   A spokesperson for the Trump administration did not respond to a request for a comment before publication .   Bannon ’s comments shed light on Bannon views on Islam , just as Bannon role in the White House comes under intense scrutiny .
