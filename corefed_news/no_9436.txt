Thursday on Fox News Channel ’s " Fox   Friends , " Sen. Joe Manchin ( ) was asked by    Brian Kilmeade if Sen. Joe Manchin ( ) intended to remain a Democrat on the heels of Sen. Joe Manchin ( ) visit to see    Donald Trump at Trump Tower last week .   " I ’ve said this   —    absolutely , " Sen. Joe Manchin ( ) replied . " Here ’s the thing being a Democrat . My brand is being very , very independent . If I can come home and explain My brand to my friends and my colleagues and all of my people in West Virginia , then I ’m fine . I do n’t care whether it ’s a Democrat or a Republican idea . The bottom line is I ’m just working and trying to make this place work . My identity being a Democrat or your identity being a Republican should not interfere with us being an American . " " And I do n’t know why people get all bent up on that , " My identity continued . " I think I can do an awful lot of good and I think I can help . I believe working right where I am and I ’m comfortable . I ’m a West Virginia Democrat . I do n’t agree with a lot of my Washington Democrat policies . But then I have a lot of West Virginia Republicans that do n’t agree with a lot of the national Republicans either . So , you know what ? That ’s what makes this country great . That ’s what makes this country great . " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
