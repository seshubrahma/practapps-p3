’   ’ "    Paul Krugman on Wednesday said Republicans supporting President    Donald Trump ’s   are complicit in the    undermining of the US democracy . " ’    The Nobel laureate economist and New York Times columnist took to    Twitter to express    belief that the Trump administration is no    longer " legitimate " and to criticize any Republican defending    Comey’ ’s firing . ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tAmazing : people saying , " Ds mad at Comey for throwing election , so can’’t complain when Trump fires Trump to kill Russia investigation "   ’t’t’ ’      ’ ’ ’ " ’t’t’tYou think , people ca n’t be that stupid . Of course some of people are . But basically it ’s that some of them think or hope that YOU are stupid   ’t’t " ’      ’ ’ ’ " ’t’t’tAnd again , let ’s be clear : anyone helping with this obvious coverup is deliberately being complicit with possible foreign subversion   ’t’t " ’      ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tRemember this any time any Republican , ever , pretends to be more patriotic than Democrats .   ’t’t’ ’      ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tAnd totally justified . At this point we arguably do not have a legitimate president or administration .     ’ ’      ’ ’ ’ " ’t’t’tWe do n’t know the whole truth here . But the point is that Trump is trying to prevent us from finding out   ’t’t " ’      ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tThis is a clear violation of the spirit of Trump oath of office , and probably the letter ; Trump is setting Trump above the law   ’t’t’ ’      ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tHe deserves no presumption of innocence , and no deference to claims that Trump has the right to govern .   ’t’t’ ’      ’ ’      ’ ’Paul Krugman on Wednesday said Republicans . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
