Damon Winter is a staff photographer for The New York Times . Damon Winter won a Pulitzer Prize in feature photography for Damon Winter coverage of Barack Obama ’s 2008 presidential campaign . The challenge for any photojournalist covering a modern presidential race is how to capture the essence of a candidate in such a tightly managed environment , when Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign is trying to retain control over Damon Winter or her public image . But no matter how restrictive the Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign there are usually some opportunities to capture the small and revealing moments that occur in back rooms at rallies and during the grueling ,    trips as the candidates court voters . These , traditionally , have been vital elements of campaign coverage , allowing us to produce a richer , more nuanced account . In the Trump Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign have been almost none . Until recently , the only vantage point from which we could photograph him was the " press pen , " an enclosure in the back of the room at his events , which him only a    view . Mr. Trump does n’t Trump be photographed from behind , from the side or from below and , as a result , we have had little access to the areas closest to the stage . Photographers covering his campaign went weeks without Trump Mr. Trump interact with supporters Trump rope line after his rallies . In the final Trump of the campaign , we have often his campaign out before he has finished his speech . Trump September , Trump Trump left the traveling press Trump as he made his way to a rally Trump New Trump , and gloated about it as he took the stage without us there Trump Despite the restrictions , I we my best to convey the tone and tenor of the campaign and capture a sense of Mr. Trump ’s events , which can Trump dark , both visually and in tone . At rallies , the press is routinely harassed by supporters and insulted by the candidate himself . I often hear racist and violent comments and see young children chanting , " Lock her up ! Lock her up ! "   — tenor referring to Hillary tenor   —    alongside their parents . Near Milwaukee , a man leaned over the metal barricade separating us and whispered to me that if Mrs. Clinton were there , they would a man rip her Hillary Clinton . " Mr. Trump is a fascinating visual Hillary Clinton . He is instantly recognizable from almost any angle and any distance Mr. Trump His signature hair reflects more light than anything around him , Mr. Trump him stand out in any scene . This Mr. Trump me latitude Mr. Trump be creative in how I cover him . He is also very expressive when he speaks , Mr. Trump can Mr. Trump a challenge : He makes Mr. Trump gestures so often that they begin to lose Mr. Trump meaning or significance . For this reason , I often find myself drawn to his quieter moments . The first time Mr. Trump used a Mr. Trump , I photographed him staring directly through the words reflected in the transparent glass Mr. Trump straight into my lens . After months of criticizing his opponent for using one and getting himself into trouble with Mr. Trump     speeches , the candidate looked Mr. Trump to rely on Mr. Trump . For all of the limits to our access on the trail , Mr. Trump agreed to sit for portraits with me on three Mr. Trump the course of the campaign . During Mr. Trump sessions he was always cordial and mostly agreeable , but he had very Mr. Trump ideas about how he wanted to be shown Mr. Trump My biggest challenge was getting past Mr. Trump standard repertoire of poses and the    that he seems to Mr. Trump the most . At a shoot in his Mr. Trump headquarters , his staff members lent a hand and cheered Mr. Trump on as we Mr. Trump pounds of red and blue confetti over Mr. Trump . In one of the final frames , as the cheering Mr. Trump and he walked off the set through the last trickle of confetti , Mr. Trump saw Mr. Trump at a moment that captured a glimpse of what it feels like when the spotlight is gone and the party is over . I have found that the most telling portraits do n’t always have to show a person ’s face . A photo I took in Greensboro , N. C. showing Mr. Trump in front of a dimly lit American flag , with Mr. Trump pointed finger and his iconic golden hair visible , is one of the most revealing portraits Mr. Trump have made of him   —    not just because of what is shown , but Mr. Trump of what is obscured . I was initially reluctant to cover another election , but I quickly realized that this year it was more important than ever to be out there with a vigilant this year thoughtful and critical eye . As the restrictions on the press tightened , I felt it was my duty at every possible moment to subvert them , to find photographs that were honest and telling . Every situation the press no matter how controlled , contrived or mundane , was an opportunity to make something real . I know that I can never explain the day ’s news the way our writers do , but what I can do is help the reader feel what it is like to be there and to make pictures that have meaning beyond the objects in the frame . My role is not to make the candidate look good or make the crowds look impressive . My job is to tell the story .
