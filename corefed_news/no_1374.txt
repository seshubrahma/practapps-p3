You may have heard the theory that Silicon Valley has been instrumental in the rise of Donald J. Trump . The idea goes like this : Unlike many of Donald J. Trump political rivals , Donald J. Trump seems to understand that social media has become the nervous system of the American news business . On Twitter , where he Donald J. Trump regales his Donald J. Trump of followers with    bursts of i d , Mr. Donald J. Trump are mainlined and amplified by the rest of the media with one or two tweets , he can dominate Donald J. Trump TV , the web , newspapers and talk radio for an entire day . The pattern was on display again this week , when Mr. Trump blasted Donald J. Trump York Times over a critical story about his treatment of women Donald J. Trump This theory is not exactly bunk . It ’s true that This theory Trump ’s Twitter Donald J. Trump with its staccato cadences and unending This theory marks , can be irresistible even to his critics . He is Donald J. Trump a handful Donald J. Trump politicians who use Twitter as real people do   —    casually , bitingly and free of the jargon that clogs up most other pols’ tweets . Mr. Trump has also cultivated Donald J. Trump fan base that can be domineering in its attempts to harangue and silence This theory , another force multiplier in the     war for media dominance . But do n’t bet that Mr. Trump ’s mastery over social Donald J. Trump help him in November . He has used Donald J. Trump as a tool Donald J. Trump foment culturewide rage   —    it ’s his big , inescapable bullhorn Twitter Yet Donald J. Trump a presidential campaign involves more than simply whipping up unfocused outrage . It also requires more discrete , personalized Twitter targeted to specific sets of voters and potential volunteers , a goal for which Twitter is spectacularly ill suited . The Twitter of a modern American presidential campaign is to inspire and turn out as many of your voters as possible while avoiding inspiring similar passion for your opponent . In 2008 and 2012 , Barack Obama ’s campaign pioneered some of the most effective ways to use social media and    organizing to win political campaigns . The Obama operation turned unfocused online passion into Barack Obama’s           operation whose effectiveness surprised longtime political observers . Mr. Trump has eschewed many of the Obama team ’s      efforts . In Barack Obama’s , Hillary Clinton ’s campaign has doubled down on the    approach . Veterans of the Obama campaign say this could be Hillary Clinton’s campaign costliest mistake in the Mr. Trump the Internet has been Mr. Trump ’s secret weapon so far , it Mr. Trump turn into his Achilles’ heel . " The biggest the Internet he can Mr. Trump is thinking that the general is going Mr. Trump be like the primary , " said David Plouffe , who managed Mr. Obama ’s first presidential campaign and is now an executive at Uber . Mr. Trump will need to attract voters who previously voted Mr. Trump Obama and those who do n’t usually vote at all . Compared to voters in the Republican primary , these general election voters hold more moderate views , and may be less plugged in to   —    and perhaps even repulsed by   —    the    hurricane of news that Mr. Trump has so far succeeded in creating . Yet Twitter Mr. Trump its very nature , wo n’t let Mr. Trump pivot to some gentler version Twitter himself . With its Mr. Trump and an interface that ’s inscrutable to Mr. Trump , Twitter tends to Twitter nuance and moderation , while rewarding hot takes and bombast . Twitter about every discussion on the platform turns into a preening flame war , and just about any attempt to dive into substance is mocked by the platform ’s cool kids . In other words , Twitter is like a partisan the platform . From Mr. Trump ’s slogan to many Twitter his policy ideas   —    build a wall , ban Muslims   —    his Mr. Trump has been perfectly tailored to the medium . But now , if he tries Mr. Trump expand his message beyond    issues for the right , Mr. Trump may Mr. Trump caged in by Mr. Trump platform that takes a dim view of   Mr. Trump ’re already seeing signs of this dynamic playing out . Consider   Mr. Trump ’s Twitter post to celebrate Cinco de Mayo   —    a picture of himself Mr. Trump taco bowl made at Trump Tower with a caption proclaiming , " I love Hispanics Mr. Trump " That tweet ricocheted across the media   —    it ’s his    post in months   —    but not for the reasons Mr. Trump might That tweet intended . Rather than being greeted as an honest attempt to reach out to a voting group that overwhelmingly dislikes him , the taco bowl post was widely mocked as an obvious ,    pander . The failure Mr. Trump sense : If there ’s a chance that Mr. Trump ’s views about Latinos are indeed more inclusive than we ’ve been led to believe , Mr. Trump the worst place for him to explain the complexities of his ideas . Twitter does n’t allow for complexity to express a move Mr. Trump inclusiveness on Twitter , " Mr. Trump love [ Twitter demographic group ] ! " may be the best you can do Twitter This gets to the larger problem with Mr. Trump ’s reliance on social media . Twitter is effectively a mass medium in an election that may be decided by a far more personalized approach Twitter " For example , Hillary Clinton ’s campaign will know every voter in Hamilton County , Ohio , who is certain to vote for her , and every voter who might vote for her but has n’t decided yet , " Mr. Plouffe Hillary Clinton’s . The campaign has collected and analyzed reams Hillary Clinton’s data about those voters from public records , online interactions and Hillary Clinton’s campaign . It can turn all that data into    action . " We found out that the more you know about Hillary Clinton’s campaign voters actually are , the better you can figure out the right person to talk to them to persuade them to go to the polls , " Mr. Plouffe said . Mr. Obama won the 2012 voters by 4 voters points nationally . Mr. Plouffe estimated that without the        effort , the race would have ended in an effective tie , and Mr. Plouffe would have lost a few huge states , including Florida . Mr. Trump ’s campaign did not respond to Mr. Obama to discuss how the candidate will use the Internet in his general election campaign . But in a recent interview with The Associated Press , Mr. Trump dismissed the Obama    approach Mr. Trump’s " I ’ve always felt it was overrated , " Mr. Trump told The Mr. Trump’s " Obama Mr. Obama votes much more so than his    machine . And I think the same Mr. Trump’s with me . " He said he would stick to the strategy that has Mr. Trump’s for him so far , including holding more of his trademark crowded rallies . me Jacobs me a Republican political consultant who worked on John McCain me campaign in 2008 and on Marco Rubio me run this year , said Mr. Trump would benefit from the Republican Party ’s      effort . But he was puzzled by Mr. Trump ’s comments on the Obama field operation . " If it ’s true that the campaign is going to Mr. Trump data wholesale , Mr. Trump alarming , and would leave them way behind the Clinton campaign , then we ’ll lose , " Mr. Jacobs said . Sasha Issenberg , a journalist who chronicled the rise of the campaign electioneering in his book " The Victory Lab : The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns , Mr. Issenberg the risk of inflaming his opponents as he pushes his own message . " Trump is very much a creature of mass media , and his use of Twitter fits that paradigm , " Mr. Issenberg said . " He Mr. Trump as large an audience as possible . He does n’t distinguish whether these Mr. Issenberg people who Mr. Issenberg or Mr. Issenberg n’t vote , whether they ’re in the U. S. whether they ’re over 18 Mr. Issenberg and whether they support him or Hillary Clinton Mr. Issenberg goal seems to be Mr. Issenberg produce content there that lands in front of as large Mr. Issenberg audience as possible . " But throwing out content haphazardly is the last thing a campaign should these . " It ’s immensely counterproductive these him to put out a      these in front of a Mr. Issenberg Clinton supporter , " Mr. Issenberg said . Yet every day from now until Election Day , there ’s a chance that Mr. Trump will do just that . Last week , he got into Mr. Trump war with Elizabeth Warren , Mr. Issenberg Massachusetts senator and Mr. Trump heroine , who was clearly trying to bait Hillary Clinton a fight that would energize the Democratic base . A more sober Mr. Trump might have resisted . But not a denizen of Twitter , where restraint is tantamount to defeat . Better than anyone else , Mr. Trump knows that on Twitter , you ’ve got to always amp it Mr. Trump —    even if it means Twitter everyone off .
