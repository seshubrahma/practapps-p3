Thurmont , Maryland ( CNN ) Thurmont , Maryland , is a quiet , idyllic town of just more than 6 , 000 people . Kids on scooters and bikes zip down hills on peaceful ,    streets with no shortage of white picket fences .   The literal " Main Street " has a small assortment of shops and services : a secondhand store , a barber shop , a bar and grill , a church and a community park . The town ’s slogan is " Gateway to the Mountains "     The town’s slogan ’s home to a both a national park and a state park .   But Thurmont is also the gateway to a highly restricted naval support facility tucked behind guarded gates inside Catoctin Mountain Park , also known as Camp David .   Originally called " " the facility has been used as a presidential retreat and place to host foreign dignitaries since President Franklin Roosevelt and is known for relaxation , fresh air and a comfortable atmosphere . The tranquil    camp houses log cabins , an outdoor swimming pool , a    golf course , a shooting range , a bowling alley and trails .    But beyond the seclusion and the activities , the camp , which is just more than a    helicopter ride aboard Marine One from Washington , also serves as a working White House . It is fully equipped with the security and resources necessary to run the country , and was activated for Vice President Dick Cheney on September 11 .   " It was a place that people like the vice president and others were relocated during a very dangerous time because it is a very protected military installation . it serves a purpose for continuity of government and continuity of operations , " said Anita McBride , who served as chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush . " There are solemn responsibilities and uses for a place like Camp David that has the full ability to operate as an office for the president . "   A FAQ on the National Park Service ’s website says the retreat is in the park but the retreat location is not displayed on park maps for " security and privacy " reasons . However , about a mile up the winding , wooded road through the park , there ’s an entrance to " CAMP # 3 , " and signs reading " RESTRICTED AREA : DO NOT ENTER , " with several other signs restricting parking and cameras . The "RESTRICTED AREA enclosed with high    fences and watch houses .   Presidential visits to the camp were once an active part of Thurmont life .   Mayor John Kinnaird , a Thurmont resident since 1960 , recalls a childhood attending church with President Lyndon Johnson and watching presidential motorcades roll through the downtown . But recently , aside from the G8 Summit that brought world leaders     along with their staffs world leaders     traveling press corps     together in 2012 , presidents have come and gone from the camp under the radar .   " There ’s a great element of secrecy , but like I say , it does a great element of secrecy really affect the residents . The President President Lyndon Johnson goes and we do n’t really know about it , " Kinnaird said , adding that presidential visits have " no impact on our community whatsoever we " The camp has the camp and storied history with United States presidents , some of whom utilized the retreat more than others . President Barack Obama , in addition to the 2012 G8 summit , hosted a 2015 meeting with a group of Gulf State leaders . He otherwise came to President Barack Obama camp infrequently , the camp few dozen times during his presidency .   President President Barack Obama W. Bush and his family spent 12 Christmases President Barack Obama Camp David during his and his father ’s President Barack Obama . President Barack Obama made 150 visits to Camp David while in office Camp David times with foreign leaders , according to CBS News’ Mark Knoller .   " Camp David was like a sanctuary Camp David Bushes and for a lot of other presidents . George W. and Laura Bush I think had an exceptional relationship with Camp David because they had spent so Camp David there , George W. and Laura Bush McBride said . " It gave President Bush an opportunity to relax , to have the outdoors at his feet , to get on his bike President Bush to ride around , to President Bush have that freedom of movement that you really do n’t have when you ’re living in the White House . " President Bill Clinton was n’t " crazy about it , " McBride said , " but then came to McBride love it , brought his staff there . " it Jimmy Carter President Bill Clinton got rid of Camp David , but a hallmark of his presidency , and perhaps the most notable President Jimmy Carter in the camp ’s history , was the signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978 .   But President Donald Trump , who has already spent three weekends of his presidency at     his " Winter White his presidency in Palm President Jimmy Carter , Florida , has n’t been to Camp David yet , and it ’s unclear whether he ’ll take full advantage of the facility President Jimmy Carter   " My father is much more of a homebody , " daughter Ivanka Trump wrote in her 2009 memoir . " Even when he travels daughter Ivanka Trump he likes a controlled environment , My father was why My father always preferred to visit one of his own My father , like his     club in My father Beach or one of My father golf courses in New York or New Jersey My father " The President called Camp David " very rustic " in an interview with The Times of London and German Newspaper Bild conducted just days before he took office . " Yea , Camp David The President very rustic , it ’s nice Camp David ’d like it . You know how long you ’d like it it For about 30 minutes , " Trump said it Kinnaird dismissed Trump ’s jibe as an "    remark . " " He may not be the kind of person that likes Kinnaird rustic atmosphere and that ’s what you ’ll find at Camp David . It ’s certainly    but it ’s Camp David atmosphere , " he said . " It some point you ’ll find President Kinnaird at Camp David for whatever reason , whether it ’s a family Camp David whether it ’s a sensitive meeting It they want to have close to It and a nice place to visit , I think he ’ll be up here . "   Whether Trump becomes a Kinnaird visitor to the facility or not , the President Trump at Camp David and its staff will continue to serve at the ready as a fully President Trump at Camp David secondary White House . Resident Paul Rothrock noted that Frederick County , where Thurmont is located , 47 . 3 % voted for Trump in the 2016 election , compared to Hillary Clinton ’s 44 President Trump at Camp David 9 % .
