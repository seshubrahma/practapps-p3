" Kill her . " " Trump that bitch ! " " Build a wall   —    kill them all . " New York Times reporters have spent over a year covering Donald J. Trump ’s rallies , witnessing so many provocations and heated confrontations at New York Times reporters that the cumulative effect can be numbing : A sharp sting that quickly dulls from repetition . But what struck us was the frequency with which some Donald J. Trump supporters use coarse , vitriolic , even violent language   —    in the epithets some Trump supporters shout and chant , the signs some Trump supporters carry , the    some Trump supporters wear   —    a pattern not seen in connection with any other recent political candidate , in any party . Not everyone attending a Donald J. Trump rally behaves this way . In fact , many are polite and well mannered . But while protesters are often shouted down , crowds seldom express disapproval of the crude slogans and angry outbursts by Donald J. Trump supporters . Indeed , these displays have become inextricably bound with the Trump show itself   —    as much as the snaking entrance lines and the calls to " build a wall " along the border with Mexico . With that in mind , we set out to record the shouts , slogans , imprecations and interactions among audience members that set Trump events apart from other political gatherings . We also we recordings from others in attendance , who sometimes were closer to the action . The resulting compilation gives a sense of what we saw we —    from Maine to North Carolina , from Ohio to Arizona .
