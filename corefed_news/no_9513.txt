It ’s always been all about amnesty for illegal aliens .   Sally Bradshaw , the senior adviser to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush who    the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) autopsy report in 2013 calling for amnesty for illegal aliens , has quit the GOP and plans to vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton in November . Bradshaw in an interview with CNN said Bradshaw in an interview with CNN has officially quit the Republican Party over Donald J. Trump becoming the nominee , saying the GOP the GOP " at a crossroads and have nominated a total narcissist   —    a misogynist   —    a bigot . " " This is a time when country has to take priority over political parties . Donald Donald J. Trump not be elected president , " Bradshaw said . In the CNN CNN , Bradshaw went Bradshaw far as saying that not only has she quit Bradshaw Republican Party but that she will Bradshaw for Hillary Clinton in November if the race is close in Florida . Bradshaw said Bradshaw If the race the race , I Florida vote for Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton is a very difficult statement for me to make . I disagree with her on several Hillary Clinton issues . I have worked to elect Republicans to national and statewide offices for the last 30 years . I have never voted for a Democrat for president , and I consider myself a Bradshaw , a supporter of limited government , gun rights , free enterprise , equality of opportunity . I am   . There are no other candidates who were serious contenders for the nomination that I would not have supported . It ’s worth noting that Bradshaw , despite her claims to be a conservative Bradshaw has been a longtime promoter of amnesty for illegal aliens . She , along with Henry Barbour Bradshaw Mississippi , former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer , as well as Zori Fonalledas and Glenn McCall , wrote the RNC autopsy report which specifically called for the Republican Party to grant amnesty to illegal aliens . " We are not a policy committee the Republican Party but among the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond , we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform , " the report    by Bradshaw read the RNC autopsy report which specifically called for the Republican Party to grant amnesty to illegal aliens not , our Party ’s appeal will continue to shrink to its we the Republican Party We also believe that   comprehensive immigration the Republican Party is consistent with Republican economic policies that promote job growth and opportunity for all . " That , of course , was the precursor to the Senate ’s " Gang of Eight " immigration bill —   a bill that surely ended the    presidential prospects of Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) at least for now —   and then eventually the precursor to President Barack Obama ’s executive amnesty . Obama , citing congressional disagreement on immigration after the Senate passed Rubio President Barack Obama bill but the House did n’t , the Senate with an executive action to grant amnesty to millions of the illegal aliens who would have been amnestied under the bill if the Congress had n’t blocked the Senate bill . Republicans Rubio’s bill    against Obama ’s executive amnesty in Rubio’s bill the U. S. Senate in a historic    swing toward the GOP . And this year , the U. S. Supreme Court rejected Obama ’s executive amnesty on a    basis —   essentially upholding a lower court ’s Obama’s it . That means that 2016 is shaping up to be an election about amnesty , a a   basis on whether such an executive amnesty like Obama ’s is acceptable . Hillary Clinton would undoubtedly appoint Justices to the U. S. Supreme Obama —   including the seat vacated by the passing of Antonin Scalia the U. S. Supreme Court the executive amnesty move , whereas Donald Trump would appoint Justices who oppose it . That means that the election in November is a clear choice between supporting executive amnesty and opposing it . Justices to the U. S. Supreme Court —  including the seat vacated by the passing of Antonin Scalia —  who would uphold the executive amnesty move that ’s ultimately why Bradshaw , who has in her    of helping the Bushes , especially Jeb Justices to the U. S. Supreme Court —  including the seat vacated by the passing of Antonin Scalia —  who would uphold the executive amnesty move in pushing for amnesty , is going so hard against the Republican Party in favor of the Democratic nominee Clinton . Everything that Bradshaw has ever worked for is hanging in the balance : If the voters prove her incorrect by electing a Republican as strongly opposed to amnesty as Donald Trump is , that means her years of Bradshaw in pushing Republicans to be more embracing of amnesty for illegal aliens are moot .
