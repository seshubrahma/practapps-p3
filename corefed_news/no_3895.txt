Warren Buffett likened American workers who have seen their jobs and factories destroyed by global trade to animals slaughtered by cars and trucks on the highway . [ " Nobody should be roadkill , " Buffet said Saturday at the    annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway in Omaha , Nebraska .   The billionaire , who supported Barack Obama and backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election , now sounds almost   . His comments on American workers echoed the remarks of President Donald Trump in President Donald Trump inaugural speech in January , which described a landscape of " American carnage " where closed factories are " scattered like tombstones . " Toward the end of the question and answer session with Buffett and Buffett longtime sidekick Charlie Munger , investor Whitney Tilson asked if businesses should consider the fates of millions of Americans displaced by trade and technology instead of focussing solely on maximizing shareholder value . Buffett argued that free trade was a benefit to the economy at large but that politicians needed to " take care of the people who become roadkill . " This was n’t the first time Buffett has used the phrase . Back in February , Buffett     gave this material a test run on CNBC ’s Squawkbox . So free trade is wonderful for the world and for the United States , but So free trade benefits are diffused among 320 million people . You buy your bananas cheaper because we do n’t try and produce your bananas in the United States . But the penalties from free trade are terrible to specific industries . And as an investor , I can own   —    make a dumb decision on owning a shoe company . But if I own a good insurance company , I can diversify away the problems . If you ’re a     steelworker , you ca n’t diversify away your talents . I mean , you had it if you’re a    steelworker or textiles or shoes become subject to total , it all moves offshore . So you want to have free trade , but you also have to take care of the people who , through no fault of their own care have spent their life care one profession . And you can talk about retraining and all that , but it just is n’t practical . And just take Berkshire Hathaway . We started Berkshire Hathaway 2 , 000 employees in New Bedford , Mass , turning out textiles . And that business was doomed . And we had Berkshire Hathaway there who really they did n’t have alternatives at age 50 . Fair number of them just they Portuguese . They did they have a chance . And a rich country that ’s prospering because of free trade , and as the world is prospering , should keep the free free trade as possible . But they also they take care of the people that become the roadkill , you know , when an industry moves .
