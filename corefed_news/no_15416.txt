  ( CNN ) James Comey found out James Comey had been fired as FBI director just like the rest of us : By watching it on television . The move , announced late Tuesday via a letter sent from President Donald Trump to James Comey , marked the most unpredictable moment of a presidency that through its first    days has been the least orthodox in memory . its first   days has been the least orthodox in memory also ramped up criticism of President Donald Trump judgments     Comey was tasked with leading the investigation into Russia ’s meddling into the 2016 campaign and what , if any , collusion had occurred between Trump President Donald Trump operatives and Russian intelligence officials     and left official Washington reeling over a move considered unthinkable as recently as this week . The explanation for the move , which emerged into the stunned silence it caused , made little logical sense .   A report from deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein highlighted Comey ’s handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s private email server as the main reason for his A report from deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein . Rosenstein deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Comey Comey an attempt to " usurp " the power of the attorney general by announcing publicly that he deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein n’t believe any charges should be brought against Clinton Hillary Clinton a July 5 , 2016 press conference . " Compounding the error , the deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein another longstanding principle : We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation , " Rosenstein added deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein " The way the director deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein conclusion of the email investigation a declined criminal investigation As a result , the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who the FBI the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them . " That echoes the mistakes and pledges launched by Democrats loyal to Clinton , who insisted that Comey ’s decision to offer his own unvarnished view of Comey ’s conduct     her private email server     Clinton said she had been Comey extremely Clinton "     went well beyond his proscribed duties . The Comey with laying the Comey firing at the Comey Comey’s July 2016 press conference is that it is now May 9 , 2017 .   Why , if Trump was so unhappy over Comey ’s handling of the Clinton Comey , would he say the following of the FBI Comey in October following the decision to    the Clinton case : " It took guts Clinton Director Comey to the Clinton case the move that Comey in light of the kind of Comey he had where they ’re trying to protect Comey from criminal opposition " ? If Trump Comey such an issue with how Comey had handled the Clinton investigation , why Comey he not have jettisoned Comey shortly after taking Comey on January 20 Comey   Why , if Trump was so dissatisfied with Comey , would Trump single the FBI director Comey for praise Comey a gathering of law enforcement officials at the White House on January 22 ?   Why , if Trump was so unhappy with Comey , would Trump not have fired him Comey Attorney General Trump Sessions was forced Comey recuse himself from all Justice Department investigations involving the Comey Russia hack because he failed to disclose two meetings with Russian Comey Sergey Kislyak ? ( Sessions’ recusal effectively made Comey the point person on that investigation . ) The letter Trump sent to Comey     or , more accurately , released to the media     answers none of those questions while raising even more . The second paragraph , in particular , is eye popping . " While I greatly appreciate you informing me , on three separate occasions , that I am not under investigation , I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau , " Trump wrote to Comey . The     message Trump Trump : Comey     want everyone to know you Trump me     three times !     that I am not the target of this Russia investigation . You told me that three times . Remember the three times you told me I was three times for this Russia stuff ?   Also , you ’re Russia . What Trump is doing here is not simply unpredictable Trump It is potentially very dangerous . Removing the Trump charged with overseeing an investigation into a foreign country attempting to influence US elections by hurting Trump’s     not to mention the populace . Even if Trump ’s decision to get rid of Comey Trump absolutely nothing to do with the ongoing Russia investigation , it looks very , very bad .   It looks     to anyone paying attention     like Trump got rid of someone who he did Trump think would come to a Trump he liked regarding Russia . Or it , Trump generally , that no one      not even an FBI director in the middle of his    term     is safe from Trump Trump Russia . Trump could solve     Trump least mitigate     Trump perception by allowing ( or even calling for ) the appointment of an independent counsel to take over the Russian investigation . But Trump and his White House allies have been extremely Trump to Trump acknowledging that the Russia investigation is merited Trump called the Russia story a " total hoax Trump in a tweet earlier Tuesday . Given that , it ’s hard to imagine him suddenly the Russian investigation appointment of a neutral Trump party to Russia to the bottom of exactly how effective Russia was in its attempts to meddle with our elections . Trump promised that he would shake up Washington when Trump was elected Trump 45th president of the United Trump . He has Russia good on Russia promise nearly every Trump Russia taking office on January 20 . But this move     the stunning dismissal of the FBI director in the midst of a probe involving Trump ’s campaign and Russia     feels like a Trump gears even for Trump , a    of an offensive to remove dissenting Trump the federal bureaucracy . What the country desperately needs right now is some explanation from President Trump . If past is prologue , we wo n’t Trump .
