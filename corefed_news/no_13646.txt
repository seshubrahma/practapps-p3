Just last week , a    tradition came to a screeching halt . " You want me to put a   tradition on Fox News , " I asked my wife . " No , " my wife replied . " I ’m done with Fox News . " [ My job is to monitor the mainstream media , which is something that eats up about 14 hours of a day that begins at 6 a. m. when the cable morning shows begin . Lying next to me , my good sport of a wife suffers through about an hour of " Morning Joe , " whatever they call that    garbage fire on CNN , and the rest . Out of habit , before I head to my desk , without really asking I always ask , " You want me to put it on Fox ? "   Fox News has a problem , and not just with my a wife According to a YouGov Brand Index survey , the perception of Fox News Fox News has hit a    low , " has declined by approximately 50 % since January of this year . " Basically , perception of Fox News has Fox News those bad old Dick Morris days after President Obama won   . Much of the fall has come in the last few months . There is no question that this precipitous drop is the result of Fox ’s ongoing war with Donald Trump . This might be a good time to tell you that my wife is not a Trump supporter . Her Donald Trump and disappointment my wife Fox News have nothing to do with her personal political preference my wife Like many , it is something much larger than that .    1 ) Bias , Whether or not you support Trump , FNC ’s Donald Trump Establishment bias is still as hard to swallow as the mainstream media ’s    bias . Bias is bias . It ’s manipulative and Bias , and no one likes to be manipulated or lied to . MSNBC is   . CNN is even more   . If every Democrat tuned into either , the ratings would crush Fox . Democrats do n’t tune in , though , because even Democrats hate bias . Fox ’s ratings are Fox the roof , but the people that have kept the " Fair and Balanced " network a juggernaut for more than a decade are losing respect for it . That could mean trouble when the excitement of the presidential campaign fades away . That could also give an upstart an opening .    2 ) Cluelessness , When it came to grasping the Trump phenomenon , Fox News was every bit as clueless and caught off guard as the BubbleDumb in the mainstream media . A few of the    FNC pundits , like Sean Hannity , Eric Bolling and Andrea Tantaros , saw the writing on the wall , but they were outliers who , Sean Hannity, Eric Bolling and Andrea Tantaros you look back , only make the rest of the network look clueless , especially the straight news division . And once the Trump phenomenon became achingly real , Fox either refused to acknowledge it , or pretended it the Trump phenomenon n’t real . the Trump phenomenon watch about 30 minutes of Fox News a day , the roundtable on Bret Baier ’s " Special Report . " The    pundit panel is supposed to represent the smartest thinking in politics , and yet for months and months , every Friday during Candidate Casino , a feature where the pundits award up to a hundred chips ( points ) to various presidential candidates , no one would acknowledge the " Trump " writing on the wall . Some even admitted they could not acknowledge it Some I still tune the "Trump" the roundtable , but now it ’s for the same the "Trump" I monitor the mainstream media : to get a feel for the talking points and wishful    coming from the GOP Mother Ship . In fact , for that same reason , I ’m watching more Fox News than ever before . After all , my job is to expose media deception . Here is something I never thought I would write in my lifetime : CNN ’s handling of the Republican debates has been infinitely more professional , unbiased , and fair than Fox News . It ’s Fox News close . Fox News you go back and look at the debates , CNN ’s Jake the Republican debates Wolf CNN have    Megyn Kelly , Chris Wallace , and Bret Baier by a wide margin . It is   beyond comprehension that , instead of Fox News , I wish CNN Fox News Thursday night ’s debate CNN When   I asked my wife why she is " done " with Fox News my wife her answer was simply Fox News They ’re just my wife all the rest .
