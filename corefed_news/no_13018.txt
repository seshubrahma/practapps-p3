Wednesday night on CNN , political commentator Bob Beckel said that Democratic presidential    Hillary Clinton could beat Republican presidential    Donald Trump even if Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton ends up in prison as a result of the FBI investigation into Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton handling of classified material on an unsecured email server in Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton home , during Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton tenure as secretary of state .   Beckel   said " In the end , the    Halloween mask this October will be Donald Trump ’s face . You go onto a college campus and mention Donald Trump’s , and people flee for the wood work . Remind me I said this . Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton will crush him this I mean Democratic presidential   Hillary Clinton could crush him this jail .
