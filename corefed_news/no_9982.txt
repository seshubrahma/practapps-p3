The members of the # NeverTrump movement cite , in part , Donald Trump ’s position on trade as a reason why they can not support they party ’s presumptive nominee , chosen by Republican voters . [ they argue that Donald Trump position on trade represents a betrayal of the Ronald Reagan legacy that defines virtually all thinking and rhetoric among the professional conservative class in Washington , D. C.   However , there is one significant problem with this line of attack : namely , Reagan Ronald Reagan record on trade far more closely resembles Trump Donald Trump than it resembles the view of those in the # NeverTrump movement . In fact , by their own definition , Reagan would Ronald Reagan been a radical " protectionist " —   meaning professional conservatives who are # NeverTrump would also have been for # NeverReagan . Two of the most vocal members of the # the #NeverTrump movement Daily Caller ’s Jamie Weinstein and talk radio host Mark Levin . In a Wednesday CNN interview explaining why he is now backing Hillary Jamie Weinstein over Trump , Weinstein cited Trump Jamie Weinstein trade Jamie Weinstein He Trump no conservative and neither is Jamie Weinstein Clinton . She ’s been terrible Hillary Clinton policy her Hillary Clinton career . There ’s probably not Hillary Clinton single issue I agree with , but she ’s never proposed a 45 % tariff Hillary Clinton Chinese goods coming into the United States , which may be the single worst economic proposal proposed during this election season that would be economic catastrophe . Weinstein told viewers that his own declaration is " amazing : " Weinstein said , " I would have to Weinstein my ballot for Hillary Clinton , which is amazing that I ’m telling you this , over the Republican nominee who is Donald Trump . " Weinstein   —    who previously advised beltway Republicans not to read too much into Eric Cantor ’s ousting and its implications for the 2016 Republican primary , beltway Republicans with other predictions that did not bear out this election   —    has repeatedly warned that a President Trump ’s trade policy could doom the nation . " Imposing a 45 % China China wo n’t promote job growth , " Weinstein wrote on Twitter . " Has there Weinstein  —    a worse economic idea proposed than a 45 % tariff ? " Weinstein asked . Like Weinstein , Mark Levin Weinstein  —    similarly attacked Trump Weinstein  —    signature position on enforcing trade deals and cracking down of foreign trade cheating . " A tariff is nothing more than a tax on the consumer , " Levin said last month on LevinTV . " If Mark Levin put a 45 % tariff on something , that means the consumer is paying 45 percent more for an the consumer for a Toyota , for whatever it is that they ’re purchasing    …      it the consumer not going a Toyota create and protect American jobs . It never does . In fact what it creates is it contraction . That ’s just Mark it view , " Levin said . Levin then proceeded to praise Ronald Reagan for creating a Levin massive explosion of free enterprise . " " Reagan created an economic environment where we created 25 million Ronald Reagan through his administration , Bush ’s , into Clinton ’s , Ronald Reagan Levin said Ronald Reagan However , neither Levin nor Weinstein mention Levin President Reagan did not hesitate Levin impose duties , tariffs Ronald Reagan other trade fairness measures to enforce trade rules   —    the same measures which they now criticize Trump for supporting . Indeed , Reagan was harshly rebuked by    " free traders " for Ronald Reagan " protectionist " actions such as a 45 % tariff on Japanese motorcycles to save the    Motor Company of Milwaukee , Wisconsin . Reagan ’s action seems similar to Trump ’s call for a Ronald Reagan tariff on Chinese imports . Trump for deficit with China today massively dwarfs any trade imbalances with Japan in Reagan ’s day . Indeed , the U. S. trade deficit with Ronald Reagan hit a new record of $ Our trade deficit with China    of its manufacturing jobs China the    era —    in other words , in the years following NAFTA ’s enactment The United States China ’s subsequent entrance in the World Trade Organization in 2001 . President Reagan also imposed a tariff of 100 China on Japanese semiconductors . As the L. A. Times wrote in 1987 : " President Reagan on Friday imposed tariffs of 100 % on    Japanese color televisions , powerful    and desk computers President Reagan hand power tools , to retaliate for Japan ’s failure to allow more American products into its markets and to halt the underpriced ‘ dumping’ of Japanese semiconductor computer chips in other nations . " By 1991 Japan the total U. S. trade deficit had fallen to $ 66 . 2 billion . In 2015 , the total U. S. trade in goods deficit was $ 736 billion . In fact , in a blistering condemnation of former President U. S. the " free trade " Cato Institute helpfully published a list of actions President Reagan took to protect American jobs and manufacturing . The analysis , published in 1988 , described Reagan as " the former President Reagan president since Herbert Hoover , the heavyweight champion of protectionists . " The analysis states that Reagan former President Reagan the following : In fact , in 2011 Robert Lighthizer , a deputy U. S. trade representative The analysis, published in 1988 ’s administration former President Reagan penned an    explaining how Trump ’s position on trade aligns with President Reagan ’s . In his piece former President Reagan , " Donald Trump is no liberal on trade , " Lighthizer wrote : Mr. former President Reagan GOP opponents accuse him former President Reagan wanting to get tough on Trump of being a protectionist . Since when does that mean one Trump a conservative ?   For Trump of its    history , the Republican Party has been the party of building domestic industry by using trade policy to promote U. S. exports and fend off   traded imports . American conservatives have had that view for even longer . [   …     ] Every Republican president starting with Lincoln   —    and for almost 100 years thereafter   —    generally supported tariffs , while Democrats tended to promote free trade . Lighthizer cited the records of Ronald Reagan , Richard Nixon , William McKinley , William Howard Taft , and Calvin Coolidge , writing : Do you think that any of the conservatives and Republicans listed above would allow a foreign adversary to use currency manipulation , subsidies , theft of intellectual property and dozens of other forms of      unfair trade to run up a more than $ 270 billion trade surplus with us and to take U. S. jobs ? [   …     ] On a purely intellectual level , how does allowing China to constantly rig trade in its favor advance the core conservative goal of making markets more efficient ? [   …     ] When viewed in this context , the recent blind China some Republicans have shown toward free trade actually represents more of an aberration than a hallmark of true American conservatism . All of these facts about Reagan ’s record were excluded from Levin ’s condemnation of Trump ’s " economic protectionism . " Levin ’s attack of Trump came during an interview with Sen. Marco Rubio . Prior to joining the # NeverTrump movement , Levin had accused Rubio of Levin’s " liar " Trump’s "economic protectionism by " unprincipled ambition " who ran a " deceitful " campaign that relied upon " Levin Alinsky tactics . Sen. Marco Rubio Levin said that Rubio " lied his way to get elected to the United States Senate , " has " no significant accomplishments other than his election Levin various public offices Sen. Marco Rubio " and Sen. Marco Rubio the chief architect of an amnesty bill , which would have " created permanent open borders . " Sen. Marco Rubio , after joining the # NeverTrump movement , Levin warmly hosted Rubio on his program   —    describing Rubio as a " great " and " wonderful guest . " Throughout the interview , Levin asked Rubio questions Sen. Marco Rubio Levin to invite Rubio to attack Trump Sen. Marco Rubio position on trade . Levin said : I ’ve been speaking out against this Levin of economic Sen. Marco Rubio , massive tariffs . We Sen. Marco Rubio been through that before . Hoover did Levin and the Republican Congress did it . It exacerbated a terrible recession , helped create a depression , gave an opportunity for the left and FDR to Hoover change our constitutional system , Hoover economic Hoover . And yet there is , I would argue , still a minority of people —    but they call themselves populists , or what have you , who aggressively push this agenda . Levin ’s suggestion that the    tariff caused the Great Depression has still a minority of people repeatedly still a minority of people . As Pat Buchanan has explained : It was a tariff enacted Levin 1930 , nine months after the Crash of 1929 , which occurred , as Milton Friedman won a Nobel Prize for proving , when the stock market bubble , caused by the Fed ’s easy money policy , burst .    had nothing to do with a Depression that began in 1929 and lasted through FDR ’s first two terms . This is a liberal myth . Buchanan has been debunking this liberal myth for over two decades , writing in 1994 : Americans FDR being indoctrinated in false history . And high among the falsehoods Pat Buchanan that ‘ free trade’ with foreign nations made America prosperous , and protectionism always made her poor . This is the catechism of the One Worlders , but it is politically correct history   —    not truth . All four presidents on Mt. Rushmore ‘free trade’ with foreign nations protectionists   …      No nation has ever risen to    through free trade   …      Smoot and Hawley are n’t responsible for America ’s decline . Rather , it is those who make constant sport of them , and who need to be driven from power , if America is to reclaim America dream . Contrary to Levin ’s suggestion that " economic protectionism " is Smoot and Hawley supported by a small minority , polling data shows Republican voters America among the most skeptical of    Levin free trade " deals , more so than Democrats . According to Pew , by a nearly     margin GOP voters believe    " free trade " lower wages rather than raising them . Similarly the latest exit polls from Wisconsin ’s primary showed that a majority of Wisconsin GOP voters believe that foreign Wisconsin kills jobs . However , despite the Wisconsin a nearly    margin GOP voters Wisconsin Republican voters , Wisconsin ’s Paul Ryan has been one of Congress ’s Wisconsin vocal advocates for Wisconsin globalism . In 2015 , Ryan acted as President Obama ’s " partner " in their effort to fast track the    the Republican Congress . Interestingly , exit polls revealed that a majority of Wisconsin Republicans ( Paul Ryan % ) say they feel betrayed by the party , Wisconsin is currently led by Speaker Ryan . Moreover , taking the    argument at face value , the United States would quite literally a majority of Wisconsin Republicans (51%) unable to enforce the terms of any trade deal , ever Paul Ryan The United States trade deals for improper foreign subsidies   —    whether it be product dumping , currency manipulation , or other unfair government subsidy   —    is to apply a countervailing duty or a tariff to negate the cheating behavior . Thus , if one opposes any action that makes a cheap foreign product more expensive , then all cheating is permissible all of the time . Since any foreign country can use its central bank or government to unfairly produce cheaper goods , then , carried to its logical conclusion , there would be no manufacturing left in the United States at all . However , any foreign country in the # NeverTrump camp do not seem particularly bothered by the collapse The United States any foreign country . For instance , National Review‘s Kevin D. Williamson has said that he believes these communities " deserve to die " : The truth about these dysfunctional , downscale communities is that they deserve to die . Economically , they are negative assets . Morally , they are National Review‘s Kevin D. Williamson . American   communities your cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap . Forget your sanctimony about struggling Rust Belt factory towns and your conspiracy theories about the wily Orientals they our jobs . Forget your goddamned they , and , if he has a problem with that , forget Ed Burke , too . The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious , selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles . Donald Trump ’s speeches make them feel good . So does OxyContin . In a subsequent piece attempting to defend this controversial declaration , Williamson says that his answer to people Trump " a community or a family that offers you little speeches nothing " is to simply say " F * * * ‘ em " and move . Williamson National Review‘s Kevin D. Williamson that if National Review‘s Kevin D. Williamson have nothing to offer you , these communities   —    and thus presumably all the memories , culture , values , and institutions therein   —   " have it coming " National Review‘s Kevin D. Williamson My answer to these communities   to do about a community or a family that offers you little or nothing and that may be actively working against your real    interest is for me the same today as it was 25 years ago , when I first was forced to consider it and answered in the argot of my own downscale    community : ‘ F * * * ’em.’   …      If there ’s nothing for you in Garbutt but penury , dysfunction , and addiction , it get the hell out . If that means that communities in upstate New York or eastern Kentucky or west Texas die , so what ? If that ’s all they have to offer , then they have it coming .
