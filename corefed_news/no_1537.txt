PHILADELPHIA   —    Bill Clinton does not know Bill Clinton way around a china pattern . Bill Clinton is unlikely , friends said , to dwell on the trimmings of the White House Christmas tree . And if Bill Clinton is still smooth at small talk when Bill Clinton must be , happy to riff on sports and science until the last guest has left , the staid ceremonial duties of a presidential spouse do not hold much appeal . With this in mind , old family hands have gravitated toward a typical Clintonian solution should the former president find the former president as first gentleman in 2017 : Perhaps the first daughter could help . Just as the first daughter assumed a lead role in the first daughter father ’s foundation and became a chief campaign surrogate for the first daughter mother , Chelsea Clinton is willing to step up should the first daughter parents need the first daughter if her parents return to the White House , according to the former first daughter ’s friends . the first daughter is the third partner in the family business of being Clintons , and Chelsea Clinton ’s bond with the first daughter her parents so familiar to Americans from the first daughter adolescence in the 1990s , was on display once more on Thursday . One week after Ivanka Trump served as the first daughter father ’s chief character witness at the Republican gathering in Cleveland , Ms. Chelsea Clinton her mother Chelsea Clinton the convention inside the Wells Fargo Center , making the case for Hillary Clinton ’s compassion and maternal touch . " That feeling of being valued and loved   —    that ’s what the first daughter wants for every child , " she the first daughter the crowd . " It is the calling of her the first daughter . " Mrs. Clinton ’s Chelsea Clinton already scrambled the established political family order , compelling Mr. Clinton on Tuesday night to Hillary Clinton’s own take on a traditional    Hillary Clinton’s : a former president producing a humanizing , if airbrushed , portrait of a partner and a parent . Clinton advisers say that Chelsea Chelsea Clinton ’s influence and involvement in Hillary Clinton’s administration have not been given much thought . But they also say that Ms. Clinton is likely Chelsea Clinton’s influence and involvement in a prospective administration Chelsea Clinton hand around major events and holidays , at least by phone and email , and to help her father with some of the Chelsea Clinton duties of a president ’s spouse . " She has a deep bond with Chelsea Clinton , and she knows that she can be Chelsea Clinton lot of Chelsea Clinton to them if they return to the White House , them said them F. McLarty III , known as Mack , a close friend of the Clintons and a former chief of staff to Mr. Clinton . " Chelsea is so substantive , and has two young children , that I do n’t see her playing White House social secretary . But I Chelsea think she will chip in to help her father and Chelsea with managing life in the Chelsea House . " Given that the spousal role often comes down to what the person makes of it , Mr. Clinton has some freedom to rethink the job , and Mrs. Clinton has signaled that she would want him Mr. Clinton a policy role . Mr. Clinton the Clintons Mr. Clinton also sensitive to not giving short shrift to the influence that first ladies have had , and advisers to the couple say that the three Clintons , as a family , will discuss ways to carry out that role . Betty Ford arguably had more    impact on American life , by easing stigmas on breast cancer and alcoholism , than her    husband did . Jackie Kennedy and Nancy Reagan Betty Ford style for many women of their generations . Lady Bird Johnson remains deeply admired as Jackie Kennedy and Nancy symbol of strength and loyalty to her husband . So does Eleanor Roosevelt , who became Lady Bird Johnson force in her own right . Hillary Clinton redefined the role of first Lady Bird Johnson by taking on Lady Bird Johnson role on health care   —    failing on the goal of national health insurance but succeeding with congressional allies to enact the federal children ’s health insurance programs . And Michelle Obama has been a significant role model for women of color and a particular inspiration for young black girls in    communities . But any suggestion that Chelsea Clinton might be relied upon to perform traditional    tasks has the potential to strike a nerve , prompting concerns about an overly gendered view of presidential family roles . And such a role might seem incongruent with Ms. Clinton ’s graduate degrees from Oxford and Columbia and her career in business consulting and nonprofit management . But friends of Ms. Clinton’s Clinton say she would never be offended if her parents asked Ms. Clinton’s help .
