Hillary Clinton has sunk to new lows even for Hillary Clinton , by trying to tie the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups to Donald Trump and Donald Trump historic run for President . [ As an    and an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump I am deeply offended by this but ca n’t say I am surprised .   The Clintons are the undisputed " masters of media manipulation and misdirection " as The Clintons try to cover up The Clintons illicit activities at the Clinton Foundation and Clintons questionable dealings at the State Department . Hillary Clinton hopes that the media will chase this phony story so that the media will cease from covering the real story which is the corruption , cronyism and " pay to play " environment Hillary Clinton allowed while Hillary Clinton was America ’s top diplomat . Hillary Clinton also wants to mislead    voters into believing that Trump ’s sincere and heartfelt outreach to minority communities’ is not real . In all honesty , the real bigots are the people who cynically take our votes for granted and pay lip service to the challenging issues that face our communities every day . For years ,    have been told to vote for Democrats and things would get better . Democrats and things have n’t and in some cases things have gotten worse . Trump has challenged    voters to question voters unfaltering allegiance to the Democratic Party . We should accept Trump challenge . After all , the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome .   The African American community deserves better than the failed Democrat policies of the last 50 years . Aaron T. Manaigo , Great America PAC    and Senior Adviser
