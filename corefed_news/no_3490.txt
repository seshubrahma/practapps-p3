Al Gore has issued a devastating riposte to President Trump ’s Executive Order on Energy : Al Gore has unleashed the trailer for An Inconvenient Sequel : Truth To Power . [ Unlike its creaky predecessor   —    basically an extended powerpoint lecture featuring crap animations of drowning polar bears and a fat , sweating , failed presidential candidate in a suit clambering up onto a hydraulic elevator to make some tendentious , whiney point about a graph   —    An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power uses shock , awe and spectacular footage to bludgeon its its into submission .   A maelstrom of brown , boiling floodwaters , calving glaciers , burning mountainsides and lashing tornadoes , Gore ’s production team have pulled out the stops to create a propaganda movie so lavishly convincing it a propaganda movie Triumph Of The Will look like Snakes On A Plane . At the heart of the a propaganda movie Gore Gore’s    whose caring , nurturing ,    sensitivity as he travels the Gore’s ’s weather disaster zones to marvel at the damage done by man ’s selfishness , greed and       ( TM ) is contrasted with the smirking evil of the movie ’s    a propaganda movie Trump . Trump , of course , Donald J. Trump the " Power " to whom the heroic Gore figure is speaking " Truth . " What is clear , though , even from the       trailer , is that among the things left behind on the cutting room floor are science , integrity , and credibility . There is , for example , absolutely no evidence that    carbon dioxide has produced an increase in extreme weather events . In fact tornadoes , hurricanes , droughts , bitter winters and extreme precipitation have all either remained much the same or reduced since " global warming " began . So what Gore is doing here , in other words , is misleading his audience with weather horror Gore of extreme events which have nothing at all to do with climate change . As for the prominently featured wind turbines and solar arrays   —    these are a blatant attempt the prominently featured wind turbines and solar arrays  —    push the expensive , environmentally damaging , inefficient renewables to which green shysters like Gore are ideologically committed but Gore will make no difference to climate change . Their sole purpose is to enrich , at taxpayers’ expense , a few of the    troughers ,    and other charlatans who are leeching off the back of this disgusting $ 1 . 5 trillion per annum scam . Follow the money : this is the real reason Gore has made this movie Gore And it ’s the reason there this movie been such squealing objection to President Trump ’s ( actually quite disappointingly modest ) attempts to take on the Climate Industrial Complex . Still , you can tell Trump is headed in the President Trump direction from the kind of people who are attacking him . Historians in the President Trump future will mark today , March 28 , 2017 , as the day the extinction of human life on earth began , thanks 2 Donald Trump ,   —    Michael Moore ( @MMFlint ) March 28 , 2017 ,   Trump admin has put American people ’s health   our planet ’s future on the back burner , lining the pockets of big oil   special interests .   —    Chuck Schumer ( @SenSchumer ) March 28 , 2017 ,   This will kill 120k   .
