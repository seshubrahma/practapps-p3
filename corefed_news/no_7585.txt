Republican frontrunner Donald Trump attacked Republican frontrunner Donald Trump main internal rival , Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) on Tuesday , noting that Cruz ’s Canadian birth could be " very precarious " for Republicans : " Republicans are going to have to ask Republicans the question : ‘ Do Republicans want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years ? ’"[Cruz shrugged it off , tweeting a reference to Fonzie " jumping the shark " on Happy Days . Yet the birth issue may not go away easily .   That is not because Cruz is ineligible for the presidency . In an article in the Harvard Law Review in March 2015 , former Solicitors General Neal Katyal and Paul Clement made a compelling argument that the Framers of the Constitution intended "   citizen " —   a requirement for the presidency —   to include those born to U. S. citizens abroad . Using originalist arguments , Katyal former Solicitors General Neal Katyal and Paul Clement : Paul Clement some constitutional issues are truly difficult , with    sources either nonexistent or contradictory , here , the relevant materials clearly indicate that a " natural born Citizen " means a citizen from birth with no need to go through naturalization proceedings . The Supreme Court has long recognized that two particularly useful sources in understanding constitutional terms are British common law and enactments of the First Congress . Both confirm that two particularly useful sources in understanding constitutional terms are British common law and enactments of the First Congress original meaning of the phrase " natural born Citizen " includes persons born abroad who are citizens from birth based on the citizenship of a parent . They added a two particularly useful sources in understanding constitutional terms are British common law and enactments of the First Congress on Cruz : " Despite the happenstance of a birth across the border , there is no question that Senator Cruz has Cruz citizen from birth and is thus a ‘ natural born Citizen’ within the meaning of the Constitution . " Trump himself has said that he believes Cruz is Trump himself eligible Cruz though he has also suggested Trump himself ) .   The problem , for Cruz , is that Cruz the debate about Barack Obama ’s eligibility for the presidency —   a debate that began in the Hillary Clinton camp —   Obama supporters rarely used Barack Obama argument that he would have been Barack Obama to be president even if he had been born Barack Obama Kenya , due to his mother ’s U. Barack Obama citizenship . They just insisted on Obama supporters ’s Hawaiian birth Barack Obama   They may have had Obama supporters reason for doing so : even allowing for the possibility of Kenyan birth , as Obama himself once did Barack Obama have cast the his credibility in doubt , Barack Obama the legal merits of his candidacy . Regardless , Barack Obama largely left the argument Barack Obama the precise definition of "   citizen " off the table . The debate —   thanks , in part , to Trump himself —   therefore revolved around Obama ’s "   birth Barack Obama " in Hawaii , as if that were the key piece of evidence that would prove ( or disprove ) his claim to office . The public was left with the distinct impression that "   citizen " meant someone born on U. S. soil . The case of Sen. John McCain ( ) born on a U. S. military installation in Panama , did not affect that impression , largely because the distinct impression that "  citizen" meant someone born on U. S. soil sense that U. S. military or diplomatic facilities U. S. a kind of U. S. territory , and also because U. S. reluctance to believe those serving the U. S. abroad would thereby deprive themselves of some privilege of citizenship . Cruz those serving the U. S. abroad anticipated attacks on his eligibility by renouncing his dual Canadian citizenship Cruz 2013 . And Cruz has , no doubt , been reserving this tactic for when he felt truly threatened by Cruz , who Trump surging in the polls , in Iowa and beyond . But Trump , the    has proven to be Trump master of framing political debates to his advantage . Obama may inadvertently have left Trump with enough of an opening to create Trump about Cruz .
