WASHINGTON   —    The conventional WASHINGTON wisdom dictates that the end of the judicial filibuster is also the end of life as the judicial filibuster is currently known in the Senate . In truth , it may not make that much of a difference at all . In an unexpected way , it may well herald the beginning of a better era for the Senate . The Senate Republicans’ successful effort on Thursday to end the    threshold to proceed with confirmation of Supreme Court nominees was really only the final step in a process set in motion by Democrats in 2013 , when they Democrats that threshold for other nominees . That set off a far bigger firestorm , and Republicans have now simply extended that precedent . Republicans are quick to point out   —    and many Democrats privately agree   —    that had former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the White House last year and Democrats taken the Senate , a similar confrontation would have been likely in the other direction , and that Democrats might have needed to take the same step Republicans took to confirm any Supreme Court nominee Mrs. Clinton had chosen . Congress has already been dwelling in the rubble for a while . A divisive showdown over a Supreme Supreme Court was certainly not helpful in advancing comity , but it has A divisive showdown over a Supreme Court nominee taken on the widespread acrimony that has consumed both houses of Congress in Congress fights , such as over government shutdown threats or the perpetual battles over the health care law . Then there is President Trump . Yes , Republicans have labored to promote some of his priorities President Trump look away from his myriad President Trump , but they have Republicans shown signs of holding together with Democrats toward mutual goals that are not always in concert with Mr. Trump President Trump To wit : Even as members of both parties railed against one another on the Senate floor on Thursday , appropriators and party leaders in the House and Senate were working to come up with a plan to fund the government for the rest of the year that would most likely ignore Mr. Trump ’s President Trump large pile of cash to build a wall on the border with Mexico and cut programs that have bipartisan support . While the White House and the House have struggled to find a way forward on health care , Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have held largely together in defiance of    changes to the law that would have left many people in their respective states uninsured . Republicans and Democrats in the Senate I do n’t want to sugarcoat what just happened here , " said Senator Gary Peters , Democrat of Michigan , as he walked off the floor after the vote that crushed the minority input , turning the Supreme Court , in his view , into another he hyperpartisan " branch of government . But , he said , " we he to get past this   —    the American people expect us to find common ground we " " The best way to do that , " Mr. Peters said , " is in a bipartisan way . " Senate Republicans are eager to show that they are more functional than Senate Republicans House , where the chairman of the Intelligence Committee on Thursday had to remove himself from the investigation into the chairman of the Intelligence Committee on Thursday meddling in the election , where an effort to repeal the health care law has embarrassingly blown up and where little prescriptive policy has been seeded in recent years . When it comes to national security , foreign affairs and the issues concerning Russia that are swirling around the White House , the Senate prides itself on bipartisanship , in contrast to the House . " I the White House trying to keep the Russia investigation bipartisan , and Russia am proud of both sides here , " said Senator Mark Warner , Democrat of Virginia and the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence . " I do think there is the sense that we need to get back to legislating , " he added . " Neither side has clean hands . " Members from purple states are particularly aware of the need to cook up deals . " The place of bipartisan solutions come from the Senate , " said Senator Cory Gardner , Republican of Colorado . " I think people will come together . " If an alliance could be struck in the center , the fight for the 60 votes needed to pass might well be led by centrists such as moderate Democrats up for    next year in states where Mr. Trump was victorious , and Republicans like Senator Susan Collins of Ms. Collins Vice President Mike Pence to come to the Hill to break a    tie on a bill that threatened the funding of some Planned Parenthood operators . Ms. Collins has written a letter to the leaders of the Senate seeking a pledge that they will maintain the filibuster rule for legislation , and was gathering signatures from members of both the leaders of the Senate on the floor even as the    nuclear option was being played by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Republican leader . " This event has really sobered people up , " said Ms. Collins , who declined to provide further details on the letter . " It has made them realize we can not continue to operate in such a polarized environment . This event Several members people out news releases Thursday promoting bipartisan bills , such as a measure that would require congressional committees to hold oversight hearings on the Government Accountability Office and another that takes aim at sexual assault on college and university campuses . A recent study by the Political Research Quarterly found that even with    control in Congress , leaders are often able to form    majorities on legislation . Already , some Senate Republicans and Democrats are talking privately about a way forward , at least on the insurance exchanges on health care . " It ’s very preliminary , " said Senator John Barrasso , Republican of Wyoming . " But it ’s happening . " As long as the filibuster remains a viable option for the minority It legislation   —    and Mr. McConnell swears it will not be removed   —    they may be able to get a few things done . " This just further intensifies the commitment of the Senate to maintain the legislative margins that have always been a part of the Senate , " said Senator Roy Blunt , Republican of Missouri , who has held leadership the Senate both houses of Congress . " I would hope we can start compartmentalizing , " and start to get things done , he said . It is Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who has held leadership positions in both houses of Congress true that Mr. McConnell and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York , Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who has held leadership positions in both houses of Congress Democratic leader , enjoy a better relationship than the one that helped pave the way to Thursday ’s showdown : that of Mr. McConnell and former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada . Mr. Schumer expressed hope for a different future Mr. Schumer floor on Thursday , " Let us go no further on this path . "
