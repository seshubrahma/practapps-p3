Sunday on ABC ’s " This Week , " Sen. Rand Paul ( ) said it is " unrealistic " to expect    Donald Trump to sell off all of Donald Trump business interests .   Paul said , " You know , I think when people voted for Donald Trump they people he Donald Trump a lot of stuff with his Donald Trump on it . The concern seems to be higher in the media than the public . People say he Donald Trump to sell his Donald Trump . How would you possibly sell 700 companies in a fire sale and hope to get what they 700 companies worth ? " " That ’s an unrealistic standard they 700 companies trying to hold him Donald Trump . He Donald Trump to do everything he Donald Trump to set up a firewall between him Donald Trump his Donald Trump , " he Donald Trump . " I think it ’s unrealistic for people to say he Donald Trump sell all of his Donald Trump . It it not like stock . We have presidents that have put their stock into account and did n’t know what their their mix is and Donald Trump agreed he Donald Trump do the same . It ’s a little different when you spend 30 years developing all these companies that we just ask him Donald Trump sell them . I do n’t think that ’s a fair request .
