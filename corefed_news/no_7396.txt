The political analysts at CalBuzz , a    political news website , report that the Republican Party elites are so terrified of Donald Trump winning the nomination that the Republican Party elites are prepared to wage a    campaign to deny Donald Trump the delegates Donald Trump needs to secure a majority before the party convention in Cleveland this summer . [ the Republican Party elites are prepared , therefore , to fight every state to the bitter end , trashing the Republican Party elites own party in the process .   From CalBuzz : For [ Senate Majority Leader Mitch ] McConnell , House Speaker Paul Ryan and the rest of the D. C. Republicans , it ’s now all about survival and maintaining [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and the rest of the D. C. Republicans majorities in Congress . all about survival and maintaining their majorities in Congress ’re smart enough to understand that if Donald Trump is the nominee of the Republican Party , Donald Trump will have a toxic effect on Senate ( 24 GOP , 10 Dem ) races and , to a lesser extent , House races across the country . If Donald Trump goes into the GOP National Convention in Cleveland this summer with less than a majority of the delegates needed to win nomination on the first ballot , Washington Republicans and Republicans Establishment patrons would rather take the nomination away from Donald Trump and give the nomination to someone who would do less damage to the rest of the Republicans running even if the nomination splinters the GOP . A divided Republican Party   —    and a Democratic president   —    would do less damage to the GOP agenda than would having Trump lose , and drag down other Republicans across the country . So the party regulars would rather purge the GOP of the Trump wing and suffer the divisions , than lose control of the Senate and weaken the party regulars power in the House . On the other hand , Trump could rack up enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot in Cleveland . In which case , Frankenstein ’s monster wins . California could be key to that plan , which would likely revolve around Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , who has set himself up as the new " . " ( Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is also fighting Trump , but is also loathed by the party elite . ) As Breitbart California ’s Jon Fleischman explained a year ago , California California a formula that favors moderates . Unless Trump wins a majority before then , the Golden State could be the GOP elites’ last stand .
