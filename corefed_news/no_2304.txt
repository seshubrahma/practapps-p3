LOS ANGELES   —    Four million dollars . That ’s what a LOS ANGELES gallery is hoping to get for Kanye West ’s " Famous " sculpture , a    silicone homage to 12 of the biggest names in pop culture . Four million for George W. Bush curled in the fetal position , a      Donald J. Trump , coquettish Amber Rose and Rihanna , a cherubic Anna Wintour and Pollyannaish Taylor Swift   —    a rogues’ gallery including Bill Cosby , Chris Brown and Ray J , and arguably three of the most famous    in modern times : Caitlyn , Kim , and Kanye . So lifelike , they Kim, and Kanye breathe , chests rising and falling as if deep in REM sleep . Seven figures for all that   —    plus the bedspread and the batteries to animate the doppelgängers   —    a number that was floated among attendees at Blum   Poe , the gallery that hosted the private exhibition last weekend . A source close to Mr. West claimed " Famous " would go on tour . Others vacillated between skepticism and quiet acquiescence at the estimate . But the gallery ’s    Tim Blum , called it the gallery a good ballpark . " " I did the math in my head , and it the math $ 500 , 000 to a million just to make it the math " said Aaron Mr. Axelrod " This caught me off guard . It ’s one of the coolest pieces I ’ve ever seen , which is kind of annoying because it ’s Kanye This . " Solipsism aside , the biggest wow , Mr. Axelrod says , is breathing life into This sculptures , since " this was made for the music video , no one would have been able to tell [ how ] those sculptures were moving . Which means he ’s going above and beyond . " On Saturday , upon early arrival the sculptures exhibition , technicians were still Mr. Axelrod up a     straight out of the    classic " . " They toyed with audio , and plugged in    batteries to make the creations come alive . And when they did , technicians automatons were eerily real . Slumbering as if in a    suspended animation . Yet the most interesting technicians of the story is the one that did n’t make the final cut . " I think Monday of last week , I got a call from Scooter Braun , " said Mr. Blum of Blum   Poe , referring to the man who discovered Justin Bieber and who is now part of Mr. West ’s management team . " Kanye suddenly felt the urge to show the work , " Mr. Blum continued . " Long story short , we made it happen . We pushed some things around and five days Mr. Blum of Blum  Poe we had a show . Monday hey , Friday open . " But we open a day before Mr. West ’s " Saint we " tour , two days before the V. M. A. s ? It seemed sheer whim , Mr. West’s indicated . Mr. West wanted an art world unveiling , a piece that members of his creative collective , DONDA , said had taken four months Mr. West’s modeling ,    scanning , stylist consulting , Instagram searches . The Mr. Blum was startlingly accurate . Each animatronic body was    down to the freckles and hair ( human ! ) all applied by hand ,     and none more ghoulish than Mr. Cosby ’s freckles or Mr. Trump ’s fleshy behind . Since Mr. West ’s " Graduation " album cover was crafted by Takashi Murakami , a client of Blum   Poe , the gallery was a natural fit . When asked about the multimillion price point , Mr. Blum —    " for the right buyer , " he said . When you tally the materials needed , labor and Mr. West ’s name , the $ 4 million price tag does n’t seem so outlandish . " I would project Mr. Blum figure about that Mr. West Mr. Blum said . " To be honest , we did it for the sake of doing it , " Mr. Blum continued . " The show and project were not done with price Mr. Blum in mind . But I would act upon it as every other piece of art I it . " Mr. Blum lasted one weekend . Like the man himself , flighty and busy , Mr. West showed up for a few minutes via an onscreen avatar on Friday night . That ’s it . " The show and project Kanye , " said his trainer of three years , Joe Bouraima , a French national whom Mr. West had helped to secure a visa after a fortuitous 2013 meeting in Paris . Ever since , the hulking Mr. Bouraima has been on and off tour with the artist for months , training daily Mr. West on " Famous . " Not once did Mr. West mention the project . And then , just like that , the mercurial Mr. West decided to stage the    show in Los Angeles   —    and then it was gone . Poof . But Mr. West ? A member of Mr. West ’s team said that the piece was " Mr. West way to its next location . " She would n’t share where , but Mr. Blum said he could picture " Famous " in a Mr. Blum , " he said . " This is a thing you could see the piece Lacma [ the piece Angeles County Museum of Art ] MOCA or the Hammer very easily . " Mr. Blum from the Hammer Museum said they had no such plans , but Mr. Blum mentioned that he and Mr. Braun were Mr. Blum shopping the piece ’s next home . The cliché rings true that all art is imitation , and " Famous " was heavily inspired by Vincent Desiderio ’s " Sleep , " which was Representatives from the Hammer Museum on Jackson Pollock ’s " Mural Mr. Blum . And though Mr. Blum Famous " was n’t built by Mr. West ’s own hand , the concept and direction were his own . Ask others who borrow liberally   —    such as Werner Herzog or Mr. Desiderio   —    all are steadfast that this work is art . Michelangelo , Quentin Tarantino and Chuck Close , have each had assistance to make their ideas come to life . Why should Mr. West be any different ? " Art is really just an idea , " Mr. Axelrod said . " It ’s follow through and direction . What makes a great artist nowadays is being able to put together a team . And he was each to give up money to put his ideas to life . " Maybe the greatest quality an artist can possess today is n’t skill or talent   —    it ’s commitment to making a vision real . That means money and time . To create something to make a great artist masses remember your name . What else is a great artist for ?
