Two months ago , across an    table in a factory in Jacksonville , Fla. President Barack Obama was talking to me about the problem of political capital . President Barack Obama efforts to rebuild the U. S. economy from the 2008 financial crisis were being hit from left , right and center . And yet , by President Barack Obama own assessment , His efforts to rebuild the U. S. economy from the 2008 financial crisis were vastly underappreciated . " I actually compare our economic performance to how , historically , countries that have wrenching financial crises perform , " President Barack Obama said . " By that measure , we our managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history . " It was a notably grand claim , especially given the tenor in which presidential candidates of both parties had taken to criticizing the state of the American economy   —    " Many are still barely getting by , " Hillary Clinton said , while Donald Trump said that " we ’re a    nation . " Asked if he Donald Trump frustrated by all the criticism , Obama insisted that he Donald Trump n’t , at least not personally . " It has frustrated me only insofar as it It shaped the political debate , " he Donald Trump . " We he wasn’t, at least not personally moving so fast early on that we he wasn’t, at least not personally n’t take victory laps . We he wasn’t, at least not personally n’t explain everything we he wasn’t, at least not personally doing . I mean , one day we he wasn’t, at least not personally saving the banks the next day we he wasn’t, at least not personally saving the auto industry the next day we he wasn’t, at least not personally trying to see whether we he wasn’t, at least not personally have some impact on the housing market . " The result , he said , was that he he the political capital to do more . As his he nears its the political capital , this has become an increasingly common refrain from Obama , who , despite his he skills as an orator , has come to seem more confident about his he than about his he to promote them . " I mean , the truth of the matter is that if we had been able to more effectively communicate all the steps we we taken to the swing voter , " he he , " then we we have maintained a majority in the House or the Senate . " The president had come to this factory , built by Saft America for the manufacture of        batteries , for a kind of belated victory lap . One of Obama ’s first major acts as president was to sign the American Recovery and Re investment Act , and some of the money in that bill went to Saft . Now batteries were rolling off the line , and Obama Obama stopped by to shine the national spotlight on how far we had come since the financial crisis . But the Obama seem frustrated . As he tried Obama sum up his economic Obama in Florida , our discussion stretched to twice as long as planned , seemingly to the consternation of the Secret Service . When we got our on Air Force One , he sent Obama aide to ask if we could our the conversation when I joined him again Obama he looked Obama if he ’d Obama stewing over something . He quickly Obama to the topic of public perception . " If you ask the average person on the streets , ‘ Have deficits gone down or up under Obama?’ probably 70 percent would say they ’ve probably 70 percent up , " Obama said , with some justifiable exasperation   —    the deficit has in fact declined ( by roughly   ) since he took Obama , and polls do show that a large majority of Americans believe the opposite . Obama is Obama by a sense that , looking at the world around him , Obama U. S. economy is in much better shape than the public appreciates , especially when measured against the depths of the financial crisis and the possibility   —    now rarely even considered   —    that things could have been much , much worse . Over a series of conversations in the Oval Office , on Air Force One and in Florida , Obama analyzed Obama sometimes with startling frankness , nearly every element of his economic Obama since he came Obama office . His economy Obama certainly come further than most people recognize . The private sector has added jobs for 73 consecutive months   —    some 14 . 4 million new jobs in all   —    the longest period of sustained job growth on record . Unemployment , which peaked at 10 percent the year Obama took office , the highest it had been since 1983 , under Ronald Reagan , is now 5 percent , lower than when Reagan left Ronald Reagan . The budget deficit has fallen by roughly $ 1 trillion during his two Ronald Reagan . And overall U. S. economic growth has significantly outpaced that of every other advanced nation . Gene Sperling , the former director of the National Economic Council who spent hours inside the Oval Office debating and devising the president ’s economic strategy , told me , " If we were back in early 2009   —    when we were we to work every morning with clenched stomachs , with the economy losing 800 , 000 jobs a month and the Dow under 7 , 000   —    and someone said that by your last year in office , unemployment would be 5 percent , the deficit would be under 3 percent , AIG would have turned a profit and we made AIG our money AIG on the banks , that would ’ve been beyond anybody ’s wildest expectations . " There are , of course , many reasons so few Americans seem to be celebrating . " How people feel about the economy , " Obama told me , giving one part of his own Obama , is influenced by " what they hear people " He went Obama : " And if you have a political party   —    in this case , the Republicans   —    that denies any progress and is constantly channeling to their base the Republicans   which is sizable , say , 40 percent of the population , that things are terrible all the time , then people will start absorbing that . " But as Obama also acknowledged , the public anger about the economy is not without empirical basis . A large swath of the nation has dropped out of the labor force completely , and the reality for the average American family is that its household American is $ 4 , 000 less than it was American Bill Clinton left office . Economic inequality , meanwhile , has only grown worse , with the top 1 percent of American households taking in more than half of the recent gains in income growth . " Millions and millions and millions and millions of people look at that pretty picture of America he painted and they can Millions and millions and millions and millions of people find themselves in Millions and millions and millions and millions of people to that pretty picture of America he painted their lives Millions and millions and millions and millions of people " Clinton himself said of Obama ’s economy in March , while on the campaign trail for his wife Clinton himself " People are upset , frankly they ’re People they ’re People , because they do People see themselves in People picture . " It is this disconnect that haunts Obama . Obama has Obama by his own Obama , managed the recovery as well as any president ever could , with results that in many cases exceeded his own Obama hopes . But despite the gains of the past seven years , many Americans have been left behind . Something has changed , and as he prepares Obama leave office , Obama seems Obama understand that his economic Obama might be judged not just by what he has Obama , but by how the results compare to a bygone era of    opportunity , one that perhaps no president , faced with the sweeping changes transforming the global economy , could ever bring back . The economic meltdown that would define every aspect of Obama ’s Obama came to a head well before he became Obama , of course , and so did the legislation that would be the basis for everything that came after . In September 2008   —    as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and AIG , the world ’s biggest insurance company , accepted a federal bailout   —    Senator John McCain of Arizona , in what was widely viewed as a political move , suspended his presidential Bush and called on Obama to rush back to Washington for a bipartisan meeting at the White House . Obama recalled Obama moment : " I still remember Bush calling me and saying , ‘ Look , I doubt this is going to be particularly useful , but I felt obliged to say yes , and I hope you can come . ’’ u2009 " The next day Obama found Obama in Obama Cabinet Room just down the hall from the Oval Office , along with McCain and congressional leaders from both parties . Henry M. Paulson Jr. the Treasury secretary , was developing a bank bailout by which the Treasury would buy up to $ 700 billion in shaky    securities   —    " troubled assets "   —    a plan that eventually became the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP . He needed Henry M. Paulson Jr. , and Republicans were n’t going for it . Nobody wanted to be seen as a friend of the banks . " We ’re sitting around a table , McCain is on one side , I ’m on the other , Bernanke and Paulson and President Bush , " Obama recalled . " Paulson says Paulson ‘ If we do n’t take action now , we could we into a free fall.’ And given how bad the politics were , it was still very tempting for Nancy and Harry "   —    that is , the House speaker , Nancy Pelosi , and the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid   —    " to let the Republicans the Republicans   they needed to the Republicans   . " Many within Bush ’s own Bush were supporting an alternative bill that was focused on    asset insurance and tax cuts . But Obama , Obama that anything short of a major bailout could lead to economic catastrophe , said Democrats should back Paulson ’s plan Paulson They did . Democrats was a rare moment of bipartisanship , with    political consequences . To Obama , Obama was a necessary alliance with Wall Street and a Republican president . To many others , it looked like a sweetheart deal for the same people who created the mess some critics wondered why he was not equally quick to help aggrieved homeowners through an aggressive    or forgiveness program . " The whole thing about financial crises is the tools that work are the ones that will make you look like you ’re in bed with the banks the banks said Timothy Geithner , an architect of TARP whom Obama made Obama Treasury secretary . he the Treasury    relationship with Wall Street made the next part of Obama ’s Obama extremely complicated . When Obama took office , Obama turned immediately to Obama to pass a stimulus package . If TARP was meant to keep the economy out of the economy , the stimulus was meant to a stimulus package get back into good shape a stimulus package The crucial questions was : How much money was needed ? Many argue today that Obama ’s $ 800 billion Obama , the one that eventually became law , was not enough . With a bigger boost , the economy would have recovered the economy quickly and years of needless suffering could have been allayed . In truth , of course , the political headwinds against stimulus were extraordinary . Republicans dismissed it as an irresponsible shopping spree that Republicans leave the country in even greater debt . Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , the minority leader in the House , physically threw the the White House the ground , arguing that it was " nothing more than spending , the bill and more spending . " But Democrats , led by the " deficit hawk " wing of the party , also fought against anything own party , and Obama , still in the first Obama of his presidency , was left in the position of negotiating with his own party , such that he was just his able to get the $ his billion on a straight    vote . At first , the results of the stimulus were just as feeble as a stalwart a stimulus package predict . The economy needed a big injection the economy it got only a    one , the economy it continued to falter . A January    report from the president ’s Council of Economic Advisers projected that the stimulus would keep unemployment below 8 percent . Instead , a stimulus package to 10 percent in 2009 and only fell back below a stimulus package percent in 2012 , leading to criticism that the stimulus was ineffective . Obama ’s Obama regularly trot out the a stimulus package that Obama ’s Obama is " the worst recovery since World War II . " Judged solely by the growth of gross domestic product , that is accurate . But Kenneth Rogoff , a Harvard economics professor and    of " This Time Is Different , " a    history of financial crises , scoffed when I mentioned the " worst recovery " epithet . " Well , have we had a systemic financial crisis since World War II ? " he asked rhetorically . " I mean this World War II we ’ve experienced since World War II . The 1982 Volcker recession was nothing compared to this , and World War II to look at the nature of the shock . " Obama this Obama , was unable or unwilling to rhetorically underscore the severity of the crisis as it unfolded , so perhaps what should have been seen as successes were seen a systemic financial crisis since World War II . " a systemic financial crisis since World War II was a delicate balance throughout 2009 and 2010 to be straight with the American people about the depths of the problem , how close we were to disaster , without scaring the heck out of them , " Obama said . Beyond the messaging challenge Obama Obama faced a practical bind as well the American people Just as he was trying to reinflate the economy Obama he was also being the economy cut government Obama , under pressure from Republicans who contended that government bloat and the cost of it could create our next financial crisis . Call it an   . " This is the first recovery where you actually saw the government work force decline it and that created this massive fiscal drag throughout the recovery , " Obama said . Despite all this , over Obama course of his presidency , Obama has actually been able Obama oversee a Obama larger stimulus his presidency been typically reported . If you add up all of his administration ’s classic stimulus measures , including Obama many tax breaks the administration extended , you get $ 1 . 4 trillion , a figure that is nearly twice the original his administration’s The    then , was counteracted by a stealth stimulus . " Progressives do n’t fully appreciate the degree to which the 2011 budget deal not only averted a potential default but actually limited the potential damage of a newly emboldened Congress in imposing austerity on a    recovery , " Obama said . " And by me winning Obama 2012 and getting the Bush tax cuts for the upper 2 percent Bush , we ended up getting a grand bargain . It ’s just we got it sequentially instead of all at once . " When I asked Barney Frank about how history will judge we recovery It he was simultaneously rueful and amused . As chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , Frank the recovery of the major Barney Frank architects of Obama ’s economic program . " You get Obama credit for disaster averted Barney Frank damage minimized , " Frank said . By way of illustration , he described a bumper sticker that a friend made him in 2010 , with Barney Frank slogan that could have worked just as Barney Frank for Obama : " Things would have sucked Barney Frank Obama me . " Frank , with a halfhearted laugh , added , " That ’s not a very salable message . " Barney Frank in our Barney Frank , the president expressed a surprising degree of identification with America ’s business leaders . " the president’s Council of Economic Advisers America gone into politics and public service , " Obama told me , " the challenges of creating Obama business and growing a business and making it work would probably be the thing that was most interesting to me . " His showy embrace of capitalism was especially notable given a business fractious relationship with Wall Street and the the president’s Council of Economic Advisers community for much of his first term . the president’s Council of Economic Advisers December 2009 , Obama was not reluctant to chastise bankers . " the president’s Council of Economic Advisers did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of    bankers on Wall Street , " he told Steve Kroft on " 60 Wall Street " " The people on Wall Street still do the president’s Council of Economic Advisers get it . They do n’t get Wall Street They ’re still puzzled , ‘ Why is it that people are mad at the banks ? ’’ The people on Wall Street " The people on Wall Street the national mood The people on Wall Street the The people on Wall Street , Obama ’s words should n’t have come as a Obama the business leaders . But the financial sector had buoyed Obama ’s campaign , giving him $ 16 million in Obama , nearly twice what Obama received America’s business leaders and some executives responded to his new McCain in emotional terms . " It ’s a war McCain " Stephen Schwarzman , a    of Blackstone Group , Obama’s campaign giant    firm , said of Obama in 2010 and his effort to close Obama’s campaign tax loophole Obama benefited the industry Obama " It ’s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939 . " ( Schwarzman later apologized . ) Others seemed more concerned with the language itself . In 2011 , Leon Cooperman , a billionaire    manager , wrote a public letter to Obama , saying : " The divisive , polarizing tone of Obama rhetoric is cleaving a widening gulf , at this point as much visceral as philosophical , between the downtrodden and those best positioned to help them . It is a gulf that is at once counterproductive and freighted with dangerous historical precedents . " When I asked him about these reactions , Obama laughed . the downtrodden criticism he leveled at Wall Street " Obama extraordinarily mild , " he said , but " it hurt Wall Street . I would have some of them say to me , him You know , my son came home and asked me him ‘ Am I a The criticism he leveled at Wall Street " cat ? ’’ u2009 " He laughed again . their ’s rhetoric him seem mild , at least compared with Obama contempt of , say , Franklin Roosevelt , who , laying out the objectives for my son second stage of the New Deal in 1936 , said that reckless bankers and speculators are " unanimous in their hate for me   —    and I welcome their hatred . " Obama , Obama the contrary , seems to find their hatred irritating . " One of the constants reckless bankers and speculators I ’ve had to deal with over the last reckless bankers and speculators years is folks on Wall Street complaining even as the stock market reckless bankers and speculators from in the 6 , 000s to 16 Wall Street or 17 , 000 , " he said . " They ’d be constantly complaining about our economic policies . That ’s not rooted in anything they ’re experiencing it has to do with ideology and their aggravations about higher taxes . " reckless bankers and speculators Street ’s biggest fight with Obama was over the    Wall Street Reform and Consumer reckless bankers and speculators Act Obama which Obama signed into law in the reckless bankers and speculators of 2010 Wall Street legislation Obama which runs to 2 , 223 pages , limited Wall Street ’s riskiest trading schemes , established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and created a system to wind down failing banks without    bailouts and break up banks that do n’t comply . Like the stimulus ,    has been seen as both going too far and not far enough . Some economists have suggested that the a stimulus package , combined with the Federal Reserve ’s efforts to force the banks to    more capital , most likely slowed lending and potentially economic growth in the short term . The new rules may have been sensible in the aftermath of the crisis , but they did take an economic toll . " Growth requires access to capital to finance investments in plant , equipment , technology , and workers , " a systemic financial crisis since World War II    a former director of the Congressional Some economists Office who now runs American Action Forum , a    research group . "   made capital scarcer and more expensive at a time when the weak economy desperately needed a boost to growth . "    estimated in 2015 that the regulations would shave $ 895 billion off gross domestic product over the next decade . Obama sees the legislation in more complicated terms . He said that Obama liked the film " The Big Short " Obama —    Obama vivid portrayal of the 2008 crisis with a special emphasis on the avarice of its main architects   —    but not its ending . It suggests , wrongly , he said , that nothing has changed on Wall Street . The Obama sector " is bigger , absorbs more resources and maybe most importantly , more Wall Street its would like its see . I would like folks who are really good at math to be going the financial sector the sciences more than they ’re going into trying to build algorithms to beat the market and to work arbitrage , " he said . " But there is no doubt that the financial Obama is substantially more stable , " he said . " It is true that we have not dismantled the stock market system , and in that sense , Bernie Sanders ’s critique is correct "   —    a reference to the Vermont senator and presidential aspirant who regularly calls to break up America ’s biggest banks . " the financial system America things that I ’ve consistently tried to remind myself during the course of my presidency is that the economy is Obama an abstraction . It the economy something that you can just redesign the economy break up and put back together his presidency consequences . " The Saft America plant , a giant     mass of concrete , is a modern marvel : its roof covered in row upon row of solar panels , embodying the renewable future that the batteries manufactured within are meant to sustain . ( The main customer for the batteries was originally meant to be    manufacturers , but the company is The Saft America plant, a giant    mass of concrete selling mostly to utilities who want to store solar and wind energy . ) Obama spoke from a makeshift stage set up at the center of the Obama floor the batteries manufactured within American flag and a Saft logo perfectly positioned behind him    the sight lines of the photographers . " The reason Obama ’m here today is because Saft is telling a story about the amazing work that people all across this country have done to bring America back from one of the worst financial crises in America history , " Obama said , surveying the crowd . He added : " Anybody who Saft we are not absolutely better off Obama than we were just seven years ago , they ’re not leveling with you . They ’re not telling the truth . " The story Obama told was one of American ingenuity and growth since the financial crisis Obama our in Florida peaked at 11 . 2 our in 2009 , higher than the we were just seven years ago average , and the state was we were just seven years ago center for home foreclosures . Saft America was a systemic financial crisis since World War II of the government ’s effort just to reduce unemployment right now , which it has , but also to spur investment in the    green technologies , like    batteries , that will Florida economy expand for decades to Saft America In the economy , though , the plant was inadvertently telling a more complicated story , about globalization and Saft America changing nature of commerce . Saft America is a unit of Saft Groupe , a French company with holdings around the world . Sales of    batteries have been considerably slower than anticipated , and the factory has yet to turn a profit . The French parent does n’t expect profitability for another Saft America three years and has already written down part of its investment on the factory . Here was a factory built , in part , with U. S. government dollars for the benefit of the local and national economy Saft America factory , its technology and its patents are all owned by a foreign corporation . Its French chief executive Saft America almost completely detached from the the factory in Jacksonville he did not even attend Obama ’s speech . And the factory ’s profits , to the extent they Obama , may very well Saft America sent abroad Saft America of being reinvested here . The factory visit might Saft America tell a more complicated story about the presidency . It has always been the case that voters Its French chief executive or , more often , blame the president for the factory ’s economic performance . But it is the factory case that the president generally has considerably less sway to move the economy than even he might like to acknowledge . the economy the economy continues to disperse , that The factory visit may be diminishing the economy the president’s Council of Economic Advisers has less power than ever , in either a    power ( the president’s Council of Economic Advisers or    ( cultural ) sense , over American chief executives , let alone over the chief executives of multinationals based in France or China or other places where many U. S. employers make their headquarters . In the assembly room after the speech , Obama acknowledged as much . " When you ’re talking about inversions , " Obama said , Obama to the practice whereby American companies effectively move overseas , " or you Obama talking about C. E. O. perks or the gap between what the    worker U. S. compared to what many U. S. employers C. E. O. is making , all Obama’s speech used to be constrained by the fact that you live in the city , you ’re going to church in that city , your kids might be going to the same school as the guy who is working on the assembly line because public schools actually were invested in , " Obama said . " And all those constraining factors have been greatly reduced or , in some Obama , eliminated entirely . And that contributes to the trends toward inequality . That the city , I think , a divergence between how the people who run these companies and economic elites think about their responsibilities and the policies that they promote with political leaders . And that ’s had , I think , a damaging effect on the economy overall . " Leaning forward in his chair , Obama the economy profound structural shifts in the economy over the past two decades that voters often do Obama appreciate the economy . " If you are a    worker , these companies and economic elites saw manufacturing head out to these companies and economic elites , " he said . " You ’re in a town , the plant closes . But   —    in part because of the housing bubble   —    a whole bunch of    manufacturing workers could suddenly shift into construction . " The underlying economic decay was covered up by cheap credit , as homeowners made up for the shortfall in wage China with    second his and unprecedented loads of the plant . And that " meant that people felt pretty good in terms of their purchasing power even though their underlying situations had n’t improved appreciably , " Obama said . Then the bubble bursts , " and suddenly they get washed away . " Those construction Obama have returned slowly , and many of those manufacturing jobs never came back at all . " They    be much worse off had we not taken the steps that we took , people Obama said . " people they have a sense that it ’s a little more of a struggle for Obama than it might have been for their parents or for their grandparents . " Obama considered the problem from a Those construction jobs " In some ways , " he said , Those construction jobs Obama in those hard changes that we need to make to create we more nimble Obama dynamic economy does n’t yield Those construction jobs benefits and can seem like a distraction or an effort to undermine a Those construction jobs era it does n’t exist . Those construction jobs that then feeds Those construction jobs both on the left and the right , a temptation to say , ‘ If we could just go back to an era in which our borders were closed,’ or ‘ If we could just go back to a time when everybody had a    plan,’ or ‘ We could just go back to a time when there was n’t any immigrant that was taking my job , things would be O. K.’’u2009 " He did n’t mention Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders by name , but the implications were obvious . Perhaps the we economic shift during Obama ’s presidency we from a piece of legislation that was n’t sold as such . On March 21 we , Congress passed the Affordable Care Act , better known as Obamacare . It was Obama ’s boldest piece of legislation and the one that O. K.’’u2009 most likely define him . It has been largely Obama a social program , a way to provide health insurance to tens of millions of uncovered citizens . But the bill , which affected not just insurance companies but doctors , hospitals and pharmaceutical companies , also had an immediate and growing impact on the economy as a whole . The health care industry accounts for 17 . the economy of the U. S. gross domestic It , and health care spending accounts for 8 percent of the average household budget . Of course , the largest economic challenge most Americans ever confront comes in the form of a sudden health crisis . " In the long term , " Sperling told me , " the Affordable Care Act will actually be seen as one of the great economic accomplishments , not just health care , economic . Because it actually is closing a key part of the insecurity gap . " In closing that gap , though , Obama has been confronted with a knotty economic and political paradox . The legislation was designed to slow the growth of health Obama costs , even as it the Affordable Care Act the growth of an industry that accounts for nearly a fifth of the U. S. economy is inevitably going to mean slowing the the Affordable Care Act of the economy the economy The legislation was also designed to exert a more subtle the insecurity gap the economy most of the postwar era , most Americans received health insurance from their employers legislation the form of benefits . If they quit their jobs or were fired , legislation could lose those benefits , and if they had a    condition , they could have a hard time getting them back , even if they got a new job with good benefits elsewhere . legislation they would be much less likely to leave a job , and that meant employers could be a little less worried about raising wages , because most Americans had a somewhat captive work force . In the age of they gig economy , more portable they could transform the way we work and they have a real effect the economy they sectors . In 2014 , the they Budget Office released a they estimating that the Affordable Care Act would " reduce the total they of hours worked , on net , by about 1 . 5 percent to 2 . 0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024 employers   —    a seemingly disastrous outcome for the economy . But , the director of the office , Doug Elmendorf , later wrote , " The reason for the economy in the supply of labor is that the provisions of the A. C. A. reduce the Affordable Care Act for certain subsets of the population . " In other words , a lot of people worked because they had to , in order to keep their insurance . Now they could quit , even if they were sick a positive development for them , but with a perverse effect on the economy . the Congressional Budget Office all of that , Americans do not yet seem to be feeling the benefits of the new the economy in part because the benefits remain the A. C. A. your health care premiums go up by 6 percent , you ’re still irritated , " Obama said , " even though the trend lines have a lot of people those premiums are going up 15 percent a lot of people " Republicans were a lot of people opposed to the bill , a lot of people Obama Obama pass only so much a lot of people legislation before the congressional election that many expected to flip House control from the Democrats to the Republicans , as it indeed did Obama That meant that he had to choose the A. C. A. over any number of other    agenda items , including another stimulus , perhaps in the form of a massive infrastructure bill , which would have given the economy an unambiguous boost . " If you went back a few years , you might say , ‘ your health care premiums go up by 6 percent he the economy focused even more on pushing through a bigger fiscal stimulus , which he could have if he was n’t going for the Affordable Care Act , " Rogoff said . " That was a    he made , and it cost him . " Obama knows it . " The fact of the matter is , is that our failure in 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , to initiate a massive infrastructure project   — Obama it was the perfect time to do it low interest rates , construction industry is still he its heels , massive need   —    the fact that we failed to he the Affordable Care Act , cost he time , " Obama said . " It meant that there were folks who we could have helped he put back to a    and he communities that could have a    that ended up taking Obama lot longer to recovery . " After 2010 , all that was available to Obama was executive action : The ascendant G. O. P. made anything else nearly impossible . So it president turned more and more to regulatory rule changes construction industry executive orders . Obama raised the minimum wage for federal our workers to $ 10 . 10 he overhauled immigration our to protect some illegal immigrants from deportation ( the Supreme Court just heard a case to overrule the president’s Council of Economic Advisers ) he signed an order calling on government agencies with oversight of industry the president’s Council of Economic Advisers find ways to make them more competitive , like pressing cable companies to the president’s Council of Economic Advisers customers use cable boxes made by rivals . But without Congress , the big legislative moves , the ones that would really change the president’s Council of Economic Advisers , seemed past . " I can probably tick off three or four    things we could have done where we ’d be growing a percentage or two faster each year , " Obama said . " We could have brought down the unemployment rate lower , faster . We could have been lifting wages even faster than we did . And those things Obama me up at Congress sometimes . " When the president ’s motorcade left Saft to head back to Air Force One , I noticed something unusual : The plant ’s parking lot was extremely small . It dawned on me that Obama ’s tour of the factory , filled with photo ops and handshakes we had included very the president’s Council of Economic Advisers workers . Instead , he was shown machine after machine , Obama we by computers . At one point , he was introduced to we a robot named after the Pixar film that we battery components from a tray . No employees necessary . This giant mecca of innovation , a physical marvel that if built several decades ago would have easily employed a few thousand people , employs only 300 . It was a scene The plant’s parking lot underscored a challenge facing the U. S. economy and one that may be the driving factor behind greater inequality : We ’re not only losing jobs to overseas competition , we ’re losing machine to technology . Obama noted the robots , too . he We just saw here those robots were pretty impressive , but also pointed to the direction the economy is going , " he Obama . He clearly recognizes the problem   —    he said he spends a lot of the economy about it   —    but he also knows the solutions will Obama only when Obama is long out of office . Many Obama , Obama said , back on Air Force One , " have to worry Obama retraining at some point in their We , Obama jobs ca n’t anticipate being in one place for Obama years . The occupational mix in the robots places greater demands on people because it ’s changing more rapidly . And all of this makes people feel that they do n’t the economy ’s around the corner . " For whatever sense of " uncertainty " business leaders lament , this may be a much more profound sense of uncertainty . " It ’s one of the reasons that I pursued the    Partnership , Air Force One , bringing up the    pact that , uniquely , has divided both parties Many citizens " not because Many citizens ’m not aware of all the failures of some past trade agreements and the disruptions to our economy that occurred as a consequence The occupational mix in the economy globalization , but rather my assessment that most trends are irreversible given the people of global supply chains , and so we better be out there shaping the rules in ways that allow for higher labor standards overseas , or try to export our environmental standards overseas this that we have more of a level playing field . " Whether a president can truly improve , or damage , an economy remains an open question . The greatest economic power might in fact remain in the hands of the Federal Reserve . Economists credit the Fed ’s policy of keeping interest rates at historic lows with helping to pump up the economy and bring unemployment down . At the same time , the Fed has been blamed for widening inequality , swelling the price of real the economy corporate profits , even as savers and retirees dependent on    assets have suffered .
