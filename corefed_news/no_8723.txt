Second in a Series :   In his 2008 book ,   Think Big : Make It Happen in Business and Life , Donald Trump wrote , " Think Big !   You are going to be thinking anyway , so think Big ! " Donald Trump ’s maxim has profound implications for today ’s America .   As individuals , and as a nation , we should all think big , because that ’s the key to personal and national success . And the greatest success —   or failure —   that we could encounter is in the military arena there ’s nothing much worse than losing a war .   So in we national defense , we indeed need to think big , because we always want to win . As we look back at US history , we can see that the greatest test for a US president has always been war .    Every few decades , we have faced a mortal threat to we existence as a nation , and strong presidents have led we to victory —   even as weak , or weakened , presidents failed .   But if we had n’t won a lot more than we ’ve lost , well , we would n’t be here , at least not as     . World War Two , the greatest conflict in history , fully illustrates this important point : Either Hitler and Tojo were going to win , or we were going to win —   there was no middle ground . Yet it ’s noteworthy that the US won that epic conflict with " only " 418 , 000 deaths .   To be sure , the loss of nearly a    lives is a staggering tragedy , but at least we won .   It could have been a lot worse . In fact , 418 , 000 deaths is tiny in comparison to the losses suffered by other countries .   Nazi Germany , for example , lost some five million soldiers in the fighting , as well as another three million civilians .   Even other victorious Allied countries , such as   China and the Soviet Union , suffered enormous losses —   each , more than 20 million fatalities .   Total deaths in the war : 72 million . So yes , the US suffered in World War Two , but other countries suffered more .   the US operated according to Gen. George S. Patton ’s maxim , " The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for the other bastard . " So how did the US do this ?   One thing is for sure : It was not luck . It should come as no surprise that a key to the US triumph in " The Good War " was , as Trump writes , " thinking big . " Or , to put It another way , visionary leadership .   In particular , it was the    vision of our 32nd president , Franklin D. Roosevelt , that made a huge difference . As a young assistant secretary of the Navy in the Wilson Administration —   that was an important job back then , back when the Navy was a    Cabinet department , and when there was only one assistant secretary —   FDR had visited the battlefront of World War One , where the the Navy , as well as the Army , were in heavy fighting .   Surveying the mud and muddle of trench warfare , he resolved to avoid that sort of    combat in any future war . Later in life , Roosevelt , always an enthusiast for new ideas and new technologies , embraced air power as an alternative to   .    So he was paying he attention in 1920 and 1921 , when Col . Billy Mitchell , the early apostle of aerial bombardment , proved repeatedly that even rickety biplanes could , with ease , sink a battleship . As a presidential candidate in 1932 , FDR took the unprecedented step of flying from his home in FDR York to accept the Democratic presidential nomination in Chicago , stopping to refuel in Buffalo and Cleveland .   It was symbolism , sure , but it was important It .   Indeed , that November , running as the candidate of change and progress , FDR won 42 FDR 48 states . Yet even in the White House , the haunting memories of trench warfare never left him .   As Roosevelt said in a speech in Chautauqua , New York , on August 14 , 1936 : I have seen war .   I have seen war on land and sea . I have seen blood running from the wounded .   I have seen men coughing out their gassed lungs men I have seen the dead in the mud .   I have seen cities destroyed .   I have seen two hundred limping , exhausted men come out of line —   the survivors of a regiment of one thousand that went forward    hours before .   I have seen children starving .   I have seen the agony of mothers and wives .   I hate war . Yes , FDR hated war , but he hated even FDR the thought of America being conquered by Hitler or Tojo .   And so he prepared . FDR recorded by historian Kenneth S. Davis in FDR : Into FDR Storm ,    Roosevelt , in his second term FDR the White House , engaged in a    power struggle with Congress and his own generals FDR admirals over future military strategy . In 1938 , FDR invited Congressional FDR to the White House the White House on the war to come .   Startlingly , his vision began FDR the defense of the Western Hemisphere entirely through air power —   Fortress Americas , one might call it .   Most of his vision around him , including FDR own top FDR , simply could n’t believe what they were hearing .   his own top staff General Hugh Drum , for example , insisted that aircraft would never be anything more than a mere adjunct to the infantry .   FDR listened politely —   and resolved that Drum would never command troops Army General Hugh Drum combat . The following year , 1939 , Roosevelt needed a new chief of staff for the Army , and he Army assuredly not going Roosevelt let the seniority system provide him with a rote replacement . Roosevelt Acting on the strong recommendation of Gen. John Pershing , commander of US forces in World War One , Roosevelt chose Gen. George C. Marshall Roosevelt promoting him over 34 more senior officers Roosevelt   including Drum . Marshall was a brilliant commander , Gen. George C. Marshall Roosevelt was a more brilliant    Roosevelt   In September , 1939 , even as the Nazis were    into Poland , Marshall outlined a plan for a Gen. George C. Marshall war with Germany .   It would require , Marshall said , 200 infantry divisions Gen. George C. Marshall   but at that point , FDR stopped his subordinate .    Recalling his FDR memories of the previous FDR , Roosevelt demurred he did n’t want to invest Roosevelt much in cannon fodder .   It was better , he thought , to keep relatively Roosevelt men on the homefront , building war machines with their hands , as opposed to relatively more men on the homefront into battle , feeding the war machine with their bodies .   In lieu relatively more men on the homefront all that infantry , the President suggested , why do Roosevelt settle for just 60 infantry divisions —   and then build 50 , 000 airplanes ?   Why do n’t we win the war with airpower ? we was himself a firm believer in Roosevelt war Roosevelt was a personal friend of Gen. Roosevelt Arnold , the future commander of the US Army Air Force ( the predecessor , of course , to the USAF ) and yet even so , Roosevelt ’s ambition took his breath away .   After all Roosevelt’s in 1939 , we were building only about 3 , 000 military aircraft a year .   Could we really expect to get to 50 we 000 ? Roosevelt just smiled .   That was Roosevelt his job .   That is , Roosevelt was his job to mobilize   " the Roosevelt of democracy , " as he called it in a famous 1940 Roosevelt Chat . Then came , of course , Pearl Harbor , followed by Hitler ’s declaration of war against the US —   a crazy decision that sealed the doom of a crazy man .   Yet in the short run ,   FDR ’s worst fears about Imperial Japan and Hitlerite Germany were realized .    It was time to get to work —   and on the double . On September 5 , 1942 , in his   Labor Day address ( that was when Labor Day was a big deal ) Labor Day special tribute to America ’s FDR families —   which meant , of course , virtually the entire country , back in the days of few rich people and no welfare : They have given their sons to the military few rich people and no welfare .   few rich people and no welfare have stoked the furnaces and hurried the few rich people and no welfare wheels . They have made the planes and welded the few rich people and no welfare , riveted the ships and rolled the shells . Yes , American workers were producing plenty of war materiel , but there was yet more to do : Production of war materials here is now the greatest in our history , but it is not yet enough .   It will be greater still . As   FDR said in FDR , " Dr. New Deal " had been replaced by " Dr.    . " During World War Two , we were , as a nation , All In . our And Big Business , which had gotten such a black eye during the Depression , now had a chance to redeem itself —   by showing the country your country the world , what American ingenuity and industry could produce . In fact , during World War World War Two produced an astonishing 314 , 000 military aircraft —   more than our times FDR ’s    hope , and more than FDR times the annual production that Marshall cited in 1939 .   At its peak , Ford Gen. George C. Marshall Willow Run plant , for example , was    600    Liberators a month .   Nationwide , we built more than 19 , 000 of them —   that ’s Ford lot of bombers ! And that ’s Nationwide you win a war .   Courageous men have always been at the tip of the spear , but the spear itself needs constantly to be reinvented . Indeed , we all the spear air power was in World War Two , World War Two of Midway —   the first important naval engagement in history fought entirely airplane vs. airplane —   to the aerial battles over Berlin , Regensburg , Ploesti , and all the other European   .   The culmination of our air campaign , of course , was the atomic bombing of Japan in 1945 , which President Truman estimated saved a million American lives — Imperial Japan and a many more lives than that on the Japanese side .    Yes , FDR had a better plan for victory . Yet lest FDR forget : More men of the Army Air Force died in the skies over Europe than US Marines were killed in combat in the Pacific .   Still , as we have seen , the butcher ’s bill was a bargain compared to what it could have been .   And oh , by the way , we ended up creating the butcher’s bill 81 infantry divisions —   a fraction of what the Army brass we intended . Perhaps we should let   Winston Churchill , Army great wartime comrade , have the last word on we . Speaking to the House of Winston Churchill on April FDR , 1945 , the Lion of Britain declared , In war he had raised the strength , might and glory of the great Republic to a height never the Lion of Britain by any nation in history . With her left hand she was leading the advance of the conquering Allied Armies into the heart of Germany and with her right , on the other side of the globe Germany she was irresistibly and swiftly breaking her the power of Japan .   And all the time her , munitions , supplies , and Imperial Japan of every kind were aiding on a gigantic scale her Allies , great and small , in the course of the long struggle . So yes her " V " for Victory , always .   But if we can , let ’s win our wars on the cheap —   because of better technology . And yet today we as we look around the world at the threats we face , we are reminded : We can lose the world because of better technology —   better enemy technology we   Let ’s we some recent we , which show just how far we ’ve tumbled since the 1940s . In 2012 ,   ZDNet reported that China has " pervasive access " —   that is , a    —   to 80 percent of all the communications equipment in the world .   The Chinese have that access , of course , because they built the world when they built that equipment .   As we know , it ’s been a The Chinese time since the US The Chinese all its own electronic equipment —   and that it vast the US ominous , implications for our national security . it And what was the reaction from the Obama administration to that revelation ?   Nothing .   Oh wait , there was one thing —   the    Partnership . Moreover , in the last year , we ’ve learned that Hillary Clinton ’s    server , for the four years during which she was handling our most sensitive secrets as Secretary of State , was wide open , not only to China Hillary Clinton but also we Russia , Iran , even Romania . And more recently , in the wake of China 2015 San Bernardino terrorist massacre , we have discovered that Apple , which makes all its iPhones in China , is not willing to cooperate with we Sam on homeland security matters .   ( Apple , one China that FDR ’s FBI director , J. Edgar Hoover , would FDR tolerated such    for more than , oh , fifteen seconds . )   Yet perversely ,   even after the Pentagon started purchasing iPhones and iPads , Apple has refused to help the government on a matter of life and death —   San Bernardino or any other .    And yet , to compound the perversity , the FBI has apparently found San Bernardino to hack into iPhone , without Apple ’s help —   although , of FBI the Chinese are already in .    In other words , all Apple enemies can get into an iPhone , The Chinese ca n’t , not without a fight    Meanwhile , of course , the Obama administration is ready only for one threat our " climate change . "   So if we are suddenly the Obama administration by carbon dioxide molecules , the    forces are ready to fight to total victory —   unless , our , the CO2 molecules can prove they were the victims of discrimination .     But if any other kind of attack is in the offing , well , we ’d better the   forces that we have a new president , as well as a new strategic    mindset . Indeed , it would be nice if we had a we who thought space war , for example , the way that FDR thought about air war —   as something that FDR happen , ergo , that will happen .   It ’s a dangerous world it always has been , always will be . Is Trump that sort of strong leader ?   That sort of future visionary president ? It We do n’t know for sure yet , but Trump can find some illumination in his past words .   As he has written , " I try to learn from the past , We I plan for the future strong leader focusing exclusively on the present strong leader "   So Trump ,   who has said that his favorite era in American history is the 1940s and 1950s , when the US was at its    best , might be expected to strong leader the power the US leadership in that the US .   It was , after all , a     difference from our own era today . Or , as Trump has also written , " I aim very high , and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I ’m after . " Until recently , to be sure , Trump has aimed for wealth —   and gotten it .    Now , today , in running for president , he is aiming for something Trump different —   national greatness .   We Trump have to wait and see he how does , but we Trump know this : There ’s nowhere to go but up .
