Monday on Fox Business Network ’s " Varney   Co. , " conservative commentator Ann Coulter , author of " In Trump We Trust : E Pluribus Awesome ! " suggested rather than impose a ban on people from certain countries , President Donald Trump should enact a temporary ban on all immigration to the United States .   Ann Coulter said if everyone were banned , that would eliminate the religious aspects that are preventing President Donald Trump from enacting President Donald Trump policy on immigration . " I mean , what President Donald Trump , for example , suggested in President Donald Trump immigration policy paper , the greatest document since the Magna Carta , was a temporary ban on all immigration , " Ann Coulter said . " You have no religious problem then . Why does n’t Ann Coulter go back to that ? It ’s both more aggressive   —    be very careful . Let in a few a year . We ’re letting in 2 million people a year   —    illegal , legal , guest workers . Probably more than 2 million . And The New York Times writes , ‘ Well , it ’s just impossible to vet that many people coming in.’ Well , do n’t let in that many people then . It it not that hard . " " And as for the detention , I would say yes , there are ways to be aggressive , " she the detention . " I ’d think in some ways I ’d be more aggressive . But I do n’t think it it raise as many hackles because it it nothing like an internment . I mean , Europe as an easier time than we do . They Europe as an easier time than we do n’t have a First Amendment . In Germany , it a First Amendment a crime to support the Nazi Party . Are you worried about the Nazis today ? No , but we are worried about ISIS . We we worried about Islamic terrorism . It ought to be a crime not merely to communicate , but to advocate that ideology and they ideology to be thrown out of the Germany " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
