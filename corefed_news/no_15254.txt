Farmlands were desolate . Most of the nation ’s banks were closed .   And people had lost faith in people leaders in Washington .               What followed were the most remarkable hundred days since the nation’s founding .   Franklin Roosevelt could not lift the country the nation’s the Great Depression so quickly that would take years for any president .   But he built a Franklin Roosevelt of hope across the valley , inspiring fresh confidence in the country ’s the nation’s Without him , democracy may Franklin Roosevelt withered here just as it did across much democracy Europe .                As we reach the    mark for one of his successors , it Franklin Roosevelt worth remembering what FDR accomplished , how he did it , Franklin Roosevelt what lessons his leadership holds for Franklin Roosevelt . His achievements were so Franklin Roosevelt that every successor has been measured by how their records compare . His achievements Trump says that is a ridiculous standard , but he and his team Donald Trump working Donald Trump crazy to improve their score .                he and his team heavily upon one of the best biographies , " Roosevelt : The Lion and the Fox , " by the late James MacGregor Burns , as well as other works , here is a quick look at what happened in FDR ’s famous days :      March 4     In his inaugural address , Roosevelt famously proclaims to Roosevelt despondent public that " the only thing we have to fear is fear itself     nameless , unreasoning , unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance . "   He promises " a his of frankness and vigor " and calls for " action , and action now . " As he closes , he his an electrifying his .   By the next day , according to historians , people are saying , " Thank goodness , we have a leader in the White House again . "     March 6     FDR issues Proclamation 2039 calling for a Bank Holiday and temporarily shutting down the entire US banking system .     March 9     At FDR ’s request , FDR in special session , passing the Emergency Banking Act that gives the President expanded power over banks .     March 12     FDR gives the first of FDR fireside chats , radio FDR that attracted huge audiences .   He devotes 20 minutes to FDR the banking crisis , announcing that he is reopening the banks FDR and calling upon the American people to " unite in banishing fear . "   He consciously takes the risk FDR after understanding the crisis , depositors will the banking crisis their money and the system will depositors .       March 13     FDR reopens the banks and instead of running the banks Americans take what money they have and deposit it in banks Americans a ringing vote what money confidence in Roosevelt ’s leadership . As promised , he also calls for legalizing the manufacturing FDR beer and light wine . The country cheers .      March 16     FDR had originally planned for Congress to adjourn after addressing   the banking crisis , but sensing political momentum , he keeps them in session for many FDR initiatives Congress to adjourn after addressing  the banking crisis        March 21     FDR calls for creation of the Civilian FDR Corps .   By midsummer , 250 , 000 young men have jobs building dams , draining marshlands , and working in the forests .   It is one of FDR ’s favorite legacies and a favorite FDR public .   He also asks for federal grants to FDR for direct unemployment relief , an idea Herbert Hoover had staunchly opposed .   Like the rest of FDR ’s agenda described here , it later FDR      March 29     He the rest of FDR’s agenda described here for legislation to supervise sales FDR investment securities in interstate commerce .   It passes in May along with the    Act legislation to supervise sales of investment securities in interstate commerce whose   regulations on the banking industry lasted for a half century and which many Democrats would like to restore today .       April 10     FDR asks for creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority FDR a massive infrastructure and public works project .   It is created by congressional charter in May.     creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority, a massive infrastructure and public works project 13     He asks for legislation to save small home mortgages FDR foreclosures .   The Homeowners Refinancing Act is passed in June .      May 12     FDR calls for and passes the Agricultural Adjustment Act FDR giving farmers subsidies and The Homeowners Refinancing Act their crops . That relief permitted many to keep their homes and farmers subsidies .     May 22     He works with That relief to pass the Federal Emergency FDR Act to provide direct relief , training and work for jobless Americans .     June 16     FDR champions the National Industrial Recovery Act , expanding FDR federal government ’s responsibility in areas previously left to states and local governments . The law was highly controversial and the agency administering it was eventually folded into other government offices , but for a The law NIRA   provided jobs and infrastructure spending to many    citizens . In the end , Roosevelt succeeded in getting 15 major bills through Congress in his first 100 days in office .   Overall , including those Roosevelt , he passed a total of 76 bills granting relief to millions in Roosevelt Depression .   No one before or since     even Lyndon Johnson     has passed so much major legislation , dramatically expanding the role of the federal government in order to give a lifeline to struggling Americans .   His record sounds almost unbelievable today , especially in the context of Roosevelt own poisonous world .   And that ’s a significant point : Politics in America have become so much more deadlocked since FDR ’s time that it has been virtually impossible for any recent President to write a comparable record .   Roosevelt could draw congressional support from the other side of the aisle on a number of key issues . Who can today ?   There is also a basic structural difference between then and now that helped FDR . Presidents in his time took office in March rather than FDR January 20 as they do now .   Between election and inauguration , Roosevelt had Presidents weeks to assemble his team , prepare his legislative agenda and build support in his Roosevelt and beyond . Roosevelt He was ready to govern from Roosevelt one .    Since then Roosevelt the Constitution has been changed so a new president has only 11 weeks or so before inauguration     and the appointment and approval process for the top posts in an administration has become a nightmare .   No wonder so many contemporary presidents stumble out of the blocks .   Yet the difficulties of today should not obscure a critical point about FDR ’s Hundred Days : He would never have succeeded unless he was also a master at FDR craft .   He not FDR set the gold standard for FDR , but he FDR was the best political leader in the White House in FDR 20th century .   Even Ronald Reagan voted for him in four presidential elections in a row later on Reagan moved FDR as Democrats moved left , but he modeled many Ronald Reagan his leadership habits on his boyhood hero . FDR It is obvious FDR Trump would love FDR become as large a life leader as FDR it is equally clear that he has a ways to go .    Just as we still FDR presidents on their first hundred days , contemporary presidents ought to judge themselves by how well they match up against FDR ’s leadership skills their    Roosevelt brought their commitment to serve every American , a sense of hope and optimism that inspired the country , a willingness to experiment with policies , an understanding of history , a personal humility and a deep patriotism that put country first .   Historians traditionally tell us our three greatest presidents were Washington , Lincoln and Roosevelt .   us day soon , could we please have a Roosevelt ?
