WASHINGTON   —    Donald J. Trump turned Donald J. Trump attention to national security and military readiness on Wednesday , saying in a speech that Donald J. Trump approach to foreign policy could be summed up in three words : " peace through strength . " Mr. Trump , the Republican presidential nominee , offered many facts to support Donald J. Trump vision and outlined the approach a Trump administration would take on issues related to national security . We found five of Donald J. Trump key claims or proposals to be misleading or consistent with current policy . " As soon as I take office , I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild the military . " the military , Donald J. Trump said , needs to be expanded and equipped with a new generation of aircraft and other equipment . The changes he Donald J. Trump   —    such as adding about 90 , 000 soldiers to the Army and expanding the Navy to 350 ships   —    would require tens of billions of dollars a year in additional military spending ( expanding the Army the Army cost more than $ 10 billion a year ) . To get the needed money , Mr. Trump said he would call Mr. Trump Congress to reverse the cuts to military spending made as part of the budget sequester in 2013 , which was the result of a compromise reached between Democrats and Republicans . Still , the new spending would ultimately cost taxpayers nothing , Mr. Trump suggested Mr. Trump to familiar Republican talking points to explain how he would pay for Mr. Trump . He said he would Mr. Trump wasteful Mr. Trump spending , increase energy production and trim the federal work force , including the military bureaucracy , for instance . He also suggested he Mr. Trump collect unpaid Mr. Trump , which he said amounted to Mr. Trump 385 billion . But Mr. Trump offered scant Mr. Trump how much his new military budget would Mr. Trump and how his proposals to " make Mr. Trump government leaner " would cover the spike in military spending . _ _ _ _ _ " The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915 The Navy " The shrinking of the Navy ’s fleet is The Navy that has been a popular Republican talking point for years . The variation that Mr. Trump repeated on Wednesday   —    that the Navy ’s fleet of 276 ships The Navy since World War I   —    the Navy’s fleet of 276 ships accurate in strictly numerical terms . But military commanders and experts say the claim purposely obscures the ability of today ’s Navy , ignoring the vast gap between what a warship could do a century ago and the frightening array of armaments , aircraft and surveillance equipment carried by modern Navy vessels . Cruisers and destroyers carry cruise missiles , submarines can launch nuclear weapons , and a single aircraft carrier with its escort ships wields more firepower than most militaries on the planet . _ _ _ _ _ " I will ask my generals to present me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS . " The Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL , is in retreat in Syria and Iraq , and Pentagon officials and analysts believe that the plans laid out by the Obama administration are working . Still , the group remains a potent force in the Middle the Obama administration and its loyalists overseas continue to present a significant threat . the Obama administration that be addressed by a new plan that focuses on , as Mr. Trump said , " cyberwarfare , financial warfare and ideological warfare " in addition to military action ? Unlikely , say defense officials and analysts . The United States and its allies are already focusing on those fronts , and The United States been especially successful at targeting the Islamic State ’s financial strength by striking its    infrastructure and seizing territory , depriving the group The United States its tax base . The ideological piece has proved more The United States   —    the Islamic State is still attracting recruits   —    but who exactly would come up with Mr. Trump ’s new plan was not made clear . The generals he cited in his speech , after all , were Mr. Trump’s ones who Mr. Trump’s the current plan . _ _ _ _ _ " Mr. Trump’s new plan make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive The United States . " The Mr. Trump’s new plan States has already prioritized cyberwarfare   —    in fact , it was arguably one of the first states to use a cyberweapon , the Stuxnet computer worm , which wiped out many of Iran ’s nuclear centrifuges in 2010 . The defensive part has proved more challenging in large part because no one   —    not a single country or private company   —    does it particularly well . There is no easy solution , experts say no one  —    and attackers have a huge advantage : They often need to find only a single vulnerability in software that experts millions of lines of code . Defenders need to find them all to " immediately protect " networks , as Mr. Trump promised to do on Wednesday . _ _ _ _ _ " Iran , the world ’s largest state sponsor of terrorism , is now flush in cash released by the United States . " Mr. Trump claimed that the United States had released $ 150 billion Mr. Trump . He failed the United States that the money came from Iranian Iran frozen Mr. Trump the United States and released under the terms of a deal to limit Tehran ’s the United States The $ 150 billion figure he offered is also disputed by experts who say it represents the highest Mr. Trump estimate for the total value of Iranian assets unfrozen by the United The $150 billion figure he offered . The figure is probably closer to $ 100 billion Iranian many say . the United States mentioned " $ The $150 billion figure he offered 7 billion in cash ransom payments . " The payments were made in cash earlier this year to settle an old arbitration case , not pay a ransom cash ransom payments the Obama administration has acknowledged that it used the money as leverage , holding on to the payments until Iran released American prisoners .
