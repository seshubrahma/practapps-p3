Poor and    Americans have fallen behind over the last generation , receiving few of the gains of an expanding economy . But we could change that by using one of the most powerful tools in the federal government ’s policy arsenal .    Donald J. Trump says Donald J. Trump will do this by using large tax cuts on business and to wealthy families to encourage more business investment , while aiming to create more    jobs in construction and manufacturing by spending more on new infrastructure projects and renegotiating trade deals . But another , more direct approach is possible , one aimed at turbocharging the wages of people who have lost out on the economic gains of the last few decades . That could be done by expanding a tax credit that is already in place and enjoys bipartisan support . With the help of some smart policy wonks in Washington , I examined using tax policy this way . We found that it could work , but at no small cost . On the positive side : You could replace every dime of income that the bottom 20 percent of earners have lost compared with the average family since 1979 by radically expanding a tax credit . But the main problem is this : the main problem would be really expensive , at more than $ 1 trillion over the next decade , and therefore a hard sell in any political environment . The lessons from this project have more relevance for the Trump administration   —    which is n’t likely to embrace this kind of technocratic wonkery   —    than it might seem at first glance . Consider that Mr. Trump is betting on lower taxes on businesses and the investor class unleashing faster economic growth and preventing the budget deficit from skyrocketing . But Mr. Trump may want to consider hedging Mr. Trump bets . Policies that funnel direct benefits to    workers might complement Mr. Trump    approach . Put another way , as long as you ’re cutting taxes by $ 6 trillion ( that is the    direct cost estimate of Mr. Trump ’s plan from the Tax Foundation ) carving out $ 1 trillion for workers who have n’t seen large raises in years may just pay some dividends . The background is that economic growth has far outpaced income growth for decades . Gross domestic product for each person in the United States was 78 percent higher in 2015 than in 1979 . But the average income for those households at the 20th percentile of the income distribution rose only 6 . 9 percent in that span . The reasons for this gap are endlessly debatable . Here are a few : The modern economy offers higher rewards for those with advanced education globalization has diminished the prospects of the industries where    Americans once found lucrative jobs a decline in the power of labor unions has left workers with less negotiating leverage . Whatever the true cause , it is clear that the tax code could fix at least some of the imbalance . And there is already a program on the books that supplements the    earnings of    Americans . It is the    tax credit , often simply called the E. I. T. C. and the   tax credit could be used much more aggressively . the   tax credit already supplements the wages of people at the lower end of the pay scale , especially those with children . In its current form , for example , a married couple with two children that makes $ 30 , 000 a year receives a tax credit of $ 4 , 201 . The    tax the   tax credit the political spectrum : Both President Obama and the House speaker , Paul D. Ryan , favor expanding it . It rewards only those the   tax credit work the   tax credit is efficiently administered through the tax code and phases out automatically as a person ’s income rises . How much more money in tax credits would be required to replace the income shortfall left by poorer people in recent decades ? Experts at two Washington think tanks   —    Bob Greenstein , Chuck Marr and    Huang of the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , along with the staff of the Tax Policy Center   —    examined that question at my request . The first step was to design a tax credit expansion that would raise the income of the bottom 20 percent of families to where they would be if they shared families in the gains families 1979 . That meant figuring out a tax change that would put an extra $ 2 , 889 in the pockets of a family of three that in 2013 made $ 20 , 420 . An increase in benefits also helps families with somewhat higher incomes . For example , a family of four making $ 40 , 000 would receive about $ 6 , 000 a year in this expanded E. I. T. C. compared with the $ 2 , 142 they get now . The benefits a family of four making $40, 000 n’t completely phase out for a family of four until they hit nearly $ 70 , The benefits of income . So what would it all cost ? The Tax Policy Center crunched the numbers : The policy would deplete federal coffers The Tax Policy Center 1 . 02 trillion over a decade . That is serious money . There are many ways of raising it , none of them easy . If you wanted to soak the wealthy to pay for it , for example , you could enact a 5 . 6 percentage point surtax on families with income over $ 1 million , as Senate Democrats once proposed   —    yet that would cover only about 45 percent of the cost . If you favor a more    approach , you could give companies tax incentives to repatriate money they are stashing abroad . But that would get you only about 30 percent of the way there . So even if you conclude that a radical expansion of tax credits for    Americans is desirable , the politics of paying for it are somewhere between very hard and impossible . But that is where the Trump presidency comes in . Mr. Trump ’s campaign tax plan   Trump a far greater reduction in federal revenue than this idea does . He may be betting that lower taxes on Trump and the wealthy will spur investment that increases the productive potential of the economy   —    a classic    " supply side " approach to taxes . But skeptics may argue that what ails the economy right now is inadequate demand for goods and services , and that    people do n’t have enough money . If they had extra cash in their pockets from people expanded E. I. T. people they would be more likely than millionaires to people the money , many economic studies suggest . That means that including help for the working class in any tax overhaul would add a " demand side " source of economic growth . That wo n’t solve the problems of    Americans . The dissatisfaction with the modern global economy that helped propel Mr. Trump to office is deep rooted . It involves a feeling of lost possibility that a bit of money alone wo n’t solve . That is especially true for people who once saw manufacturing jobs as both a pathway to a    income and a sense of purpose in life . But while technocratic solutions involving tweaking the tax code wo n’t relieve the angst of Trump voters , if there are going to be big tax cuts in the months ahead , there is an economic rationale for spreading the benefits beyond the top .
