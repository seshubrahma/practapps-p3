Donald Trump has a greater opportunity to make inroads with young voters in 2016 than previous Republican presidential candidates , a new poll finds . [ The poll , conducted through over 100 mobile apps by MobOpinions and VoterLabs , shows the recent political conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties had little effect on those born between 1981 and 1998 .   While Hillary Clinton continues to lead among likely voting millennials 37 % to 29 % with 21 % still saying they are undecided . The numbers translate to a statistically insignificant 2 point net bounce over Donald Trump when compared to    survey numbers . When asked " if America ’s best days are behind America’s best days or ahead of America’s best days , "   respondents were closely split , with 38 % seeing America ’s best days ahead , 33 % behind and 29 % saying respondents are unsure . However , likely undecided voters are n’t so sure about the future of the country   —    38 % of these voters believe America may never live up to it ’s past , a margin of 12 points over the 26 % who see the future as bright . The only other voter segments who hold a similar negative view of the future were Trump supporters and white voters . Of supporters of Donald Trump , only 27 % see the future as bright . A whopping 49 % of Trump supporters and a full 46 % of white voters think America ’s best days have passed . " Trump seems to tapping into people who have given up on the American dream and future of America .   It suggests a certain gloominess that might explain why they would be comfortable with a political outsider , with little relevant experience , to shake up a system they feel is broken , " said pollster Mitchell Barak of MobOpinions . Though when forced to choose between only the Democratic and Republican candidates , Mrs. Clinton beats Mr. Trump 60 % to 40 % previously undecided voters unsure of the future flock to Trump by an 8 point margin . If Trump can win those undecideds who share his Trump ’s view of the future , he Trump bring the race to a dead heat among likely voting millennials . This would be a huge turnaround from previous elections , where Democratic candidates enjoyed massive advantages with young voters . In 2008 , for example , Barack Obama carried the millennial vote by 66 percent   —    the largest share of the youth vote since 1972 .    polling suggests that Trump still has a steep hill to climb . A recent    survey put Trump Trump fourth place with young voters , behind Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Gary Johnson . On the other hand , past elections suggest that voters gravitate away from       as voting day gets closer . But who will they gravitate towards ? Trump Trump opportunity may lie with former supporters of Bernie Sanders , who dominated the youth vote before he bowed out of the race and endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . A poll last month showed that a whopping 50 percent of millennial Sanders supporters are unprepared to back Clinton , with 13 percent backing Trump and a further 37 percent backing third party candidates . " At this point in the campaign , Clinton has Clinton clear advantage with    year olds , but Donald Trump can make great gains if he can Donald Trump with disaffected millennials and get them out disaffected millennials the polls , " said Walter Kawecki of VoterLabs . The survey results suggest that focusing on their respective experience and vision for the nation may be the best way for candidates to sway millennial voters , with over 80 % millennial voters preferring this approach to attacks on their opponents candidates The representative sample consisted of 601 millennials from across the United States with a 3 . 5 % margin of error . In order to measure to true effect of the conventions , the survey ran the week following the close of Republican and Democratic National Conventions to allow for    bounce equalization .
