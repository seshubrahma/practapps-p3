HONG KONG   —      Donald J. Trump ’s golden quiff , bushy eyebrows and preening gestures were immortalized this week in China   —    though perhaps not in a way that he would like . They appeared on a giant rooster statue , just above some    feet and a    wattle that hangs below a gilded nose and mouth . The statue , which was installed outside a shopping mall in the northern Chinese city of Taiyuan , was built to celebrate the coming Year of the Rooster in the Chinese lunar calendar and comes less than a month before Mr. Trump ’s inauguration . Mr. Trump’s inauguration is 23 feet tall . Relations between Washington and Beijing have been especially jittery in recent weeks . The tension is due in large part to Mr. Trump , who belittled China during Mr. Trump presidential campaign and caused a diplomatic stir this month by making clear that Mr. Trump views the central basis for diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing   —    known as the One China policy   —    as up for negotiation . But reaction to the rooster on Chinese social media was light and full of positive emoji . Global Times , a    tabloid , said on Tuesday that onlookers in Taiyuan , the capital of Shanxi Province , had praised the statue as a " perfect blend of Chinese and Western cultures . " " It ’s not bad looking , " Zhang Guoqiang , an employee at the Yihui Japanese Restaurant at the North America N1 Art Shopping Center , where the statue is , said by telephone on Thursday . Inflatable " Trump chicken " replicas were on sale at Taobao , an online shopping bazaar , with a    version advertised for $ 1 , 725 . Casey Mr. Latiolais said in a telephone interview that he completed the design in early November for Beijing Reliance Commercial Land , a real estate company that had contacted him through Behance , a website where artists post he portfolios . Mr. Latiolais said the company had artists only for a statue to artists Year of the Rooster and did not mention Mr. Trump . Mr. Latiolais , 30 , declined to comment on why he had given the rooster    features . But Mr. Latiolais said he had the Rooster the size Mr. Latiolais the Mr. Latiolais product , which is made of fiberglass . " This was way more yuge than I expected , " he wrote on Twitter . Mr. Latiolais said that Mr. Latiolais was also surprised when the statue was " sort of bipartisanly Mr. Latiolais at as funny " by his friends and family   —    including his parents , who Mr. Latiolais for Mr. Trump . It was not Mr. Latiolais first time since the American presidential election that people in China had likened Mr. Trump to a bird with notable hair . In November , Mr. Trump a Chinese journalist of a golden pheasant with a blond pompadour and a red body circulated widely on social media and were published online by People ’s Daily , the Communist Party ’s main newspaper . The bird , which lives in a safari park in the eastern city of Hangzhou , became a star attraction there and a muse for Hsiaohan Chen , a political cartoonist in Taipei . Mr. Trump has a penchant for lashing out at his critics , however minor , on Twitter . But as of Thursday Mr. Trump , he had not commented on either bird .
