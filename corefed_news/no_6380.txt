TIME Magazine ’s latest cover story is another shot at trolling President Donald Trump by suggesting President Donald Trump is not truly in charge of the White House   —    this time profiling     Jared Kushner , asserting that the two men " are bound to rise or fall together . " [ The story   —    by Philip Elliott , Massimo Calabresi , Zeke J. Miller , and Michael Scherer   —    clearly hopes to repeat the success of the magazine ’s February issue . That cover story   —    titled " The Great Manipulator " and illustrated by a grim pose from former Breitbart News exec Steve Bannon   —    reportedly caused friction between Trump and Trump chief White House strategist by depicting the President as not really in charge of the President administration .   This objective becomes obvious in passages that elevate Kushner to the same level of authority as Trump or higher . " Both men " are " running a nation and steering the world , " the closing paragraph reads . Another line says Kushner and Kushner wife Ivanka Trump " view Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump primarily as Trump ’s protectors . " The reporters state that Kushner , " unlike those around Kushner [ , ] does not have to worry about Kushner job . " This is not merely from Kushner connection to the Trump family , the Trump family write , but because Kushner " outsmarted , outhustled , or outperformed everyone else around . " For all the Trump family praise , the authors do get in a few jabs , as well . the authors cite " a counselor at Jared ’s prep school " to note that " Jared’s grades and test scores would not his grades and test scores justify admission to Harvard , " but Jared’s got in after a $ 2 . 5 million donation from Jared Kushner . Likewise , his grades and test scores claim Jared was the only senior White House adviser who suggested firing FBI director James Comey , setting off an " entirely predictable uproar .
