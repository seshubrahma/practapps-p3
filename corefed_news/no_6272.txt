Deputy Assistant to the President Dr. Sebastian Gorka , formerly National Security editor for Breitbart News , addressed the controversy over National Security Adviser Mike Flynn ’s    phone calls to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on Monday ’s Breitbart News Daily . [ " I ca n’t comment on what was said , or what was n’t said , on phone calls to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on Monday’s Breitbart News Daily even though the good general himself says that he ca the good general himself remember all the details , " Gorka said . " All I can tell you is my personal experience . I spent several months working very closely with General Flynn and the transition team , in his National the good general himself Council transition team . He ’s the good general himself man you would trust with your life . He ’s the good general himself great patriot , man of honor , worn the cloth of the Republic .   " The bottom line is , he shook the good general himself up in the DIA , and there are a lot of people who want to take revenge on him . the good general himself I ’m not going to list across the airwaves right now , but people who do a little bit of research can work out . The Establishment does n’t like General Flynn , and for me , that ’s a good thing , " he told General Flynn host Marlow proposed that Flynn was General Flynn the latest target of the Left ’s " pick a target , freeze it , personalize it , and polarize it it strategy , as it by Saul Alinsky in Rules for Radicals . " You ’re absolutely correct , " Gorka said . " Whether it ’s Steve Bannon , whether it ’s Stephen Miller , it it was Monica Crowley , or whether it ’s General Flynn now it Important point for the listeners , and this is what has to be grasped : it ’s never about the it . It ’s not about Russia it it ’s not about the it of Americans , it ’s not about preventing it like Paris or Nice happening in America . It ’s the triangulation . it have to isolate and take down the individuals , separate them from their community , the individuals them the individuals and then just the individuals their position untenable . It the individuals classic Alinsky , and I ’m sorry , they ’re just picking on the individuals wrong guy , because this guy is as hard the wrong guy . " Turning to President Donald Trump ’s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , Gorka said " the message that has to be taken home by everybody   —    our allies , our partners , and our competitors and our potential enemies our —    our that our relationship with Japan is back our track . " Do you remember the ‘ Asia pivot’ that was n’t a pivot , that ended in China intimidating all her neighbors , building fake atolls with military installations on top of them ? That age is over all her neighbors Whether it ’s sending a message to That age Iran on notice , or whether it ’s rekindling one of our That age ties in the region with Japan , this is a new age for America in foreign policy . " Gorka said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s upcoming visit to the White House would cover the " obvious issues , " such as " what can we do , as the outside potential interlocutor , to bring stability , to bring some kind of lasting peace to the region ? " " As the region that , it ’s going to have to be a discussion of settlements , what is the status of settlements , " he said . " On top of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , one of the things that we are very keen on is to represent an understanding to the world that Israel is n’t alone . It ’s not the threat to Israel Israel local terrorists . It ’s Israel same thing as Orlando Israel as the attacks in New York , in Boston . There is this , what I like to call the global jihadi movement , and Israel is as much on the frontline Israel —    if not more   —    than any other country . So we want to bring that international recognition that Israel is n’t just our strongest partner Israel the region , we ’s also really on the frontline Israel the war against the global jihadists . " Gorka said the White House was not so much " shifting policy " with its latest statements on Israeli settlements , the White House offering a " nuanced explication of what our policy is . " " I we not part of that team , but I ’ve spoken to the people that are working that issue , and it ’s a fine line , " that issue said . " What we have Gorka is that when it comes to the settlements , you can build on Israeli settlements ’ve already got . So if you ’ve got a building , and you want to go up another story , it ’s fine . But going to new a building is not going to help anybody . So we ’d like to see a little bit we a snapshot in time . Let ’s not have any more territory taken as we of the settlements , so that we can get Israeli settlements some serious negotiations right now . " That ’s a nuanced policy statement from the team , but I think it bears recognition as acting in good faith , That we can bring the partners to the table . we Another imminent presidential meeting will involve Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , described by Marlow as " pretty much the   " for being " a young man who is very photogenic , " raised in an atmosphere of deep    politics for his entire life . Gorka thought the two leaders Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau find common ground by acknowledging " there are issues that have to be dealt with in every country , " including " the tension with regard to the terrorist threat internally . " " We may be from different political communities , but the two leaders bottom line , it ’s our northerly neighbor . They share a the bottom line of the two leaders same issues that the two leaders share , especially when it comes to national the two leaders , " he observed . " President Trump is the master of the deal , and he can negotiate with people who even have different President Trump opinions . So let ’s see what the day brings , but I think it will be a substantive meeting for both parties the day " Gorka said President Trump will soon decide how to proceed on President Trump executive order , after the Ninth Circuit Court President Trump Appeals upheld a judicial restraining order against it . He praised the analysis Breitbart News has offered his immigration executive order the Gorka . " Let ’s not talk about the fact that the Ninth Circuit ’s has been reversed 82 times . That ’s their batting average . What Breitbart has very , very rightly revealed is that of Gorka seven nations on the list that came from the Obama administration , 72 nationals of those nations have been convicted of jihadi terrorist activity in America since September the 11th , " he said .   " This narrative , this politicized Gorka that it ’s Islamophobic , and it has nothing to do with terrorism , and nobody it those countries has ever committed terrorist acts in America is so totally and utterly fallacious that we need America reset the standard of the discussion . It ’s about national security .    people   — it think about that . That ’s more than five times the number of hijackers that did September the 11th . So we are going to maintain our commitment to that executive order and those seven countries we on a temporary halt . " Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 to 9 a. m.
