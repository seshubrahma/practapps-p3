’   ’ "    In case you have n’t noticed , Volvo is back . " ’    Over the past few years , the    automaker has made    a stunning recovery from the jaws of financial and return to    prominence as the leading purveyor of safe , sophisticated , and    undeniably Swedish cars . ’ ’    Under the guidance of parent company Geely Holdings , Volvo has    unleashed an    generation of models built around is        Scalable Product Architecture ( SPA ) platform and        engines . ’ ’    Chief among this is the    second generation Volvo    XC90 SUV that swept the 2015 award season   —    . ’ "    Leading the charge on this side of the pond is Volvo Cars of    America CEO Lex Kerssemakers . The veteran auto executive sat down    with Business Insider at the 2017 New York International Auto    Show . Our conversation touched on various topics including the    state of the US auto market ,    ’s new South Carolina    factory , and Volvo ’s plan for autonomous driving . " "    In 2016 , automakers sold a record 17 . 6 million cars in the US .    But , thus far in 2017 , the auto market has struggled to keep up       last year ’s torrid pace .   While Kerssemakers sees    increasing difficulty in trying live up to 2016 , he          in the strength of the the auto market   " ’   ’ ’    " The pressure is definitely increasing and the level of incentive    spending is up , " Kerssemakers said . Kerssemakers But we’’re still talking    about ( selling ) 16 million to 17 million cars . It’ ’s still pretty       , even if we’’re a bit disappointed that it’ ’s down It’ to    last year . " ’ "    Further , he believes Volvo It’ relatively small market share , when    compared to    ’s Big Three , dulls much of the effects of    most sales    .   " ’    " To be honest , as a brand with 0 . 5 % to 0 . 6 % market share , I’’m not    looking everyday at the development of the overall US market in    the same    as brands with greater sales volume like the Big 3 , "    the Volvo boss said . " I think it can fluctuate quite a lot before    a brand like Volvo is affected Volvo "   ’ ’    One of the tenets of the Trump Administration has been the    bolstering of US manufacturing . For Volvo , the Volvo of the    US production plan is a new $ 500 million factory in South    Carolina that is expected to enter service in the third quarter    of 2018 .   ’ ’    " We decided two years ago to ( manufacture ) in the United States    because we wanted to We a clear signal to our retailers , We    have been our loyal partners We and to our customers that We    are We to stay , " the affable Dutchman said . " In 2007 and    2008 , articles popped up of people saying that Volvo is going to    leave the US market and that’ ’s absolutely not true . So the best    proof of that is to put a factory on American soil , which we    did . " ’ ’   ’ ’    Now with plants in Europe , China , and US , Volvo has domestic    production facilities in the three most important markets in the    world . According to Kerssemakers , local manufacturing brings    Volvo closer Volvo Volvo and shields Volvo company from    Volvo the global currencies .   ’ "    The new factory , expected to have the ability churn out 100 , 000    cars a year , will produce the company ’s next generation S60 sedan    for domestic consumption and export .   " "    In 2015 , Volvo made waves by importing its    —    becoming Volvo first major brand to sell      cars in the US . The S60L was originally developed    for China ’s chauffeur ’s culture , but the car made its debut in    the the car as the    the US .   " ’    " We decided to import it two years ago and now the   Inscription model ’s 70 % of our    S60 sales in the We because , like the the US Americans like    space as well , " he told us . " It’ ’s it’    We the    it’ love it and so the customers . " it’ ’ ’    According to Kerssemakers , the success of the S60L is    representative of the advantages of having a global manufacturing    footprint that allows the company better flexibility to tailor    its product offerings based on regional needs      ’ ’   ’ "    While it ’s become a success , there are still lingering concerns    among the public and the media about China ’s ability to produce    cars that are on par with their Swedish counterparts . " ’    " To be honest , there’ ’s no ( difference in quality ) at all , " the    Volvo chief executive said . " It’ ’s absolutely a none issue . It’ ’s    purely between the ears It’ " ’ "    In fact , when the first S60s came in from China , the company ’s    dealers went through It’ with a fine tooth comb looking for    quality issues and did n’t find anything , Kerssemakers    said .   " ’    " We have a global manufacturing process that includes Swedish    engineers who go to China , train everybody there and see that China everything is running according to Volvo standards    " Kerssemakers    told us . " Irrespective of Kerssemakers    ’s produced We it’ ’s the same    quality . " ’ it’    By committing to      turbo    engines and electrification in 2008 , Volvo made the bold decision    to push the Volvo towards the direction of advanced technology    and environmental friendliness rather than traditional luxury . ’ "    Now it ’s working towards the next frontier , autonomous    driving .   " "    One of Volvo ’s partners in the development of next generation Volvo technology is Uber . However , the controversial tech    firm ’s efforts have been beset by development issues including    the crash of an autonomous XC90 test car in Arizona . " "    However , Volvo is not wavering in its support of Uber ’s Volvo autonomous driving program . Volvo ’    Uber Accidents do happen , but we believe in the partnership with Uber    and we Volvo fully confident that it will continue to be Volvo , "    Kerssemakers said .   ’ ’   ’ ’    However , the Volvo CEO cautioned that the public and the auto    Volvo should be cautious in the pace of developing autonomous    tech development . ’ ’    " There’ ’s a lot of talk about autonomous drive , but there are a    lot of systems out there that are not autonomous drive . They are    pilot assist systems , " he said a   lot of systems " We should be very careful    There’ we don’’t start a   lot of systems believe we are there already . a   lot of systems   ’ "    a   lot of systems fact , Kerssemakers told us that true level 4 or level 5    autonomy a   lot of systems n’t be ready until well into the next decade . " ’    " Every company , every brand is driving millions of test miles    with autonomous cars . So we are still in a test phase , " he a   lot of systems said .   ’ "    But , even with Volvo Volvo tilt towards high tech , the brand    stands for one thing above all else and that ’s safety . As a    result , for Kerssemakers , success in the quest for autonomous    driving does Kerssemakers necessarily mean being first in the marketplace ,    rather it ’s about being the safest and most reliable .      ’    " This is not a sprint we want to win and be the first , it’ ’s not    about that . We it’ to be leading , but leading means high tech we that’ ’s reliable and safe , " he said .   " For Volvo , it’ ’s a    Volvo , not a it’ . " ’ " In case you have n’t noticed , Volvo is back . ..
