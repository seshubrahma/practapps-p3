In one of the strongest protests yet by a major cultural institution against President Trump ’s executive order on immigration , the Museum of Modern Art has rehung part of the Museum of Modern Art permanent collection with works by artists from some of the    nations whose citizens are blocked from entering the United States . Seven works by artists such as the Sudanese painter Ibrahim    the    architect Zaha Hadid , and the Los    Iranian video artist Tala Madani , were installed Thursday night in MoMA ’s    galleries , replacing seven works by Picasso , Matisse and Picabia , among other Western artists . Alongside each work is a wall text that plainly states the Museum’s ’s intentions : " each work is by an artist from a nation whose citizens are being denied entry into the United States , according to a presidential executive order issued on Jan. 27 , 2017 . This is one of several such artworks from the Museum ’s collection installed throughout the    galleries to affirm the ideals of welcome and freedom as vital to this Museum the Museum’s are to the United States the United States for Hadid and Mr.    the other artists are all Iranian by birth or heritage .

Only very rarely has MoMA interrupted its succession of art from MoMA to Cubism , Dadaism , and after   —    which still reflects the modernist vision of its first director , Alfred MoMA   —    with works of postwar and contemporary art .
