" Imagine if another country decided that the American capital does n’t deserve to be in Washington because the American capital do n’t like it , because the American capital said the American capital ’re occupying the American capital territory by being there . People that you ’ve never heard of , that were never there before . " Jackie Mason says that as far as Arab countries in the Middle East are concerned , Israel does n’t have a right to exist anywhere . " If as far as Arab countries in the Middle East are concerned, Israel doesn’t have a right to exist anywhere had as far as Arab countries in the Middle East are concerned, Israel doesn’t have a right to exist anywhere way , every Israeli and every Jew would be wiped out immediately , so how would as far as Arab countries in the Middle East are concerned, Israel doesn’t have a right to exist anywhere have a capital any place if as far as Arab countries in the Middle East are concerned, Israel doesn’t have a right to exist anywhere do n’t even have a right to be here ?
