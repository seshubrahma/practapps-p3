Mr. Schneiderman , is already investigating Donald J. Trump over possible violations of New York State law at his charity foundation . Another , Donald J. Trump Healey of Massachusetts Ms. Healey an investigation into whether Exxon Mobil   —    whose chief executive , Rex W. Tillerson , is Mr. Trump ’s choice for secretary Donald J. Trump —    lied to investors and the public about the threat of climate change . Ms. Healey also has a new    pitch : " I wo n’t hesitate to take Donald Trump to court if he carries out Donald J. Trump campaign promises , " Donald J. Trump recently wrote Donald J. Trump supporters . A third , Representative Xavier Becerra , who Ms. Healey chosen this month to become California ’s attorney general , has dared the Trump administration to " come at us " over issues including immigration , climate change and health care . As Democrats steel themselves for the day next month when the White House door will slam on Democrats backs , some of the country ’s more liberal state attorneys general have Democrats to use their power to check and balance Mr. Trump ’s Washington . If the Trump some of the country withdraws from environmental , antitrust or financial regulations , the attorneys general say they will plug regulatory holes that may gape wide open , deploying state laws the Trump administration withdraws from environmental, antitrust or financial regulations New York ’s Martin Act , which allows the state attorney general to pursue    investigations on Wall Street . They have pledged to defend undocumented immigrants , and to combat hate crimes that the Trump administration withdraws from environmental, antitrust or financial regulations believe were unleashed by Mr. Trump ’s polarizing campaign . And if Mr. Trump ’s policies veer toward the unconstitutional , several of the 10 current Mr. Trump Democratic attorneys general interviewed recently said they would apply a remedy favored by Mr. Trump himself : a lawsuit . The the 10 current and incoming Democratic attorneys general interviewed recently could be as simple as mirroring the blueprint laid out by their Republican colleagues , who made something of a legal specialty of tormenting President Obama . Conservative attorneys general in states including Texas , Virginia and Florida have sued the Obama administration dozens of times , systematically battering Mr. Obama ’s signature health care , President Obama and immigration policies in the courts . President Obama , Scott Pruitt , the attorney general of Oklahoma , who used his office to bayonet Conservative attorneys general in states including Texas, Virginia and Florida Obama ’s    regulations , was just chosen by Mr. Trump to Scott Pruitt the new head President Obama Environmental Protection Agency . Mr. Schneiderman   —    who established himself early as a nuisance to Mr. Trump when he sued him over Trump University , negotiating a $ 25 million settlement   — Mr. Trump on the Mr. Trump selection Mr. Trump calling him " an agent of the oil and gas industry " and promising to push an E. P. A. Mr. Trump Mr. Pruitt to uphold environmental laws . Ms. Healey has also expressed concern about the nominations of Mr. Pruitt Pruitt Tillerson . The jockeying to begin hostilities with the Trump administration is a measure of how the country ’s widening political divide has transformed the offices of state attorneys general into legal laboratories and sharpened them into political scalpels . They were once primarily local law enforcement figures who rarely pursued issues beyond state borders the offices of state attorneys general into legal laboratories But with the growth the offices of state attorneys general into legal laboratories their clout and ambition over the last three decades , they have become magnets for lobbyists , campaign donors and the offices of state attorneys general into legal laboratories corporate representatives looking to intervene in regulatory policy and the offices of state attorneys general into legal laboratories investigations , a New York Times investigation found in 2014 . Under President Bill Clinton , attorneys general pioneered the major multistate lawsuit that has served as a model for interstate collaboration since , with nearly all the states joining together to win a groundbreaking settlement with the tobacco industry . Liberal states later collaborated to force the E. P. A. under President George W. Bush to regulate greenhouse gas emissions , winning a Supreme Court decision that made it easier for the states to sue the federal government . It was under Mr. Obama that states came into their own as Liberal states . One group of Republican attorneys general began holding weekly conference calls to strategize ways to states the Affordable Care Act months before it became law in March 2010 , filing their lawsuit minutes after Mr. Obama signed the bill . For the moment One group of Republican attorneys general the precise shape of    targets is One group of Republican attorneys general to make out Mr. Obama the annual meeting of the National Association of Attorneys General in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. two weeks ago , bipartisan bewilderment about the   ’s true intentions abounded . ( Republican state attorneys general will slightly outnumber Democrats in 2017 . ) " People are coming up to me and saying , ‘ What ’s going to happen ? ’ " said James E. Tierney , a former attorney general of Maine , who ran a program studying attorneys general at Columbia Law School . Mr. Tierney , a Democrat , now lectures at Harvard Law School . " There ’s a lot of    down here James E. Tierney, a former attorney general of Maine, who ran a program studying attorneys general at Columbia Law School like , ‘ Oh my God . ’ Columbia Law School attorneys general from blue strongholds like California , Massachusetts and New York hasten to brand themselves as leaders of the opposition , many of their Democratic colleagues are striking a less antagonistic note as they wait to see how Mr. Trump will govern attorneys general from blue strongholds like California, Massachusetts and New York One incoming attorney general , T. J. Donovan attorneys general from blue strongholds like California, Massachusetts and New York Vermont , said he was ready to collaborate with their Democratic colleagues federal government to tackle the heroin epidemic in his state , among other issues   —    and to dissent when One incoming attorney general, T. J. Donovan of Vermont . " Let ’s be patient and wait and see what happens , " One incoming attorney general, T. J. Donovan of Vermont said . " But at the same time , let ’s be prepared . " Mr. Schneiderman , it seems , is not straining to give Mr. One incoming attorney general, T. J. Donovan of Vermont the benefit of the doubt . Since Election Day , ’s said in an interview One incoming attorney general, T. J. Donovan of Vermont has spoken to several attorneys general about teaming up Mr. Trump Democratic attorneys general have already done to defend Mr. Obama ’s    One incoming attorney general, T. J. Donovan of Vermont against Republican legal challenges . One incoming attorney general, T. J. Donovan of Vermont Life just got a lot more exciting for those of us at the state level who are now the first line of defense , " said Mr. Schneiderman , adapting a favorite catchphrase of Republican attorneys general . Their litigiousness turned attorneys general like Greg Abbott , now the governor of Texas , into    luminaries One incoming attorney general, T. J. Donovan of Vermont often rallied crowds by saying , " I go to the Republican attorneys general in the morning , I sue Barack Obama , and then I go home . " Next year One incoming attorney general, T. J. Donovan of Vermont there is likely to be no shortage of Democrats who can say the same about Mr. Trump . The states’ rights arguments that Republicans have made gospel for nearly eight years   —    that states must serve as a check against federal overreach   —    are likely to become convenient for Democrats . So are the legal tactics that Republican attorneys general used to stifle Obama administration programs , including filing lawsuits in front of friendly local judges to win nationwide injunctions against policies they hoped to stop , said Amanda Frost , a professor at American University ’s Washington College of Law . With Mr. Trump ’s ascension , attorneys general of both parties friendly local judges shuck any remaining veneer of nonpartisanship , even as they continue to wade across party boundaries on investigations involving consumer protection or pharmaceutical pricing . According to Paul Nolette , a    professor at Marquette University , who studies attorneys attorneys general of both parties , Republican attorneys general filed partisan legal briefs in only five Supreme Court cases during the Clinton Mr. Nolette the Obama administration . " Things are being driven more by partisan politics , " Mr. Nolette said . " On virtually every    issue you can imagine , A. G. s are signaling where they stand . " As Mr. Abbott and Mr. Pruitt found , there are certain advantages to occupying a    law enforcement office with an    megaphone . Josh Shapiro , the incoming Democratic attorney general of Pennsylvania , said he had turned down a run for the Senate this year in favor of the attorney general race . " I believe it to be the most impactful job in government today , " he said . Other Democrats said they were watching how Josh Shapiro, the incoming Democratic attorney general of Pennsylvania Trump would treat the Consumer Financial Protection Board and the Federal Trade Commission . Under Mr. Obama , attorneys general have grown used to working closely with both agencies on consumer and antitrust Josh Shapiro, the incoming Democratic attorney general of Pennsylvania   —    " It Other Democrats been the golden years , " said Tom Miller , the longtime Democratic attorney general of Iowa   —    and several said they feared federal regulatory might would shrivel under the new administration , leaving states to try to hold the line with far fewer resources . " I do n’t want to pick fights before there are fights , " said Brian Frosh , the Tom Miller, the longtime Democratic attorney general of Iowa   attorney general of Maryland . " But based on the campaign , there ’s cause for concern . "
