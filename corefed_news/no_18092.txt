’   ’ ’    The AHCA is dead , long live The AHCA . ’ "    The healthcare bill ’s swift death occured , in part , because House    Speaker Paul Ryan and the Trump administration are anxious to get    to some legislative policy where they House   Speaker Paul Ryan and the Trump administration rack up a win   —      specifically , tax reform .
