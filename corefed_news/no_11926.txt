Glenn Greenwald writes that Hillary Clinton proves America has a    justice system   —    one that is inordinately harsh to the common people and one that is virtually inactive for the elites . [ From The Intercept :   Secrecy is a virtual religion in Washington . Those who violate its dogma have been punished in the harshest and most excessive manner   —    at least when Those who violate its dogma possess little political power or influence . As has been widely noted , the Obama administration has prosecuted more leakers under the 1917 Espionage Act than all prior administrations combined . Secrecy in DC is so revered that even the most banal documents are reflexively marked classified , making even the most banal documents disclosure or mishandling a felony . As former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden said back in 2000 , " Everything ’s secret . I mean , I got an email saying ‘ Merry Christmas.’ an email saying ‘Merry Christmas.’ carried a top secret NSA classification marking . " People who leak to media outlets for the selfless purpose of informing the public   —    Daniel Ellsberg , Tom Drake , Chelsea Manning , Edward Snowden   —    face decades in prison . Those who leak for more ignoble and    ends   —    such as enabling hagiography ( Leon Panetta , David Petreaus ) or ingratiating oneself to one ’s mistress ( Petraeus )   —    face career destruction , though Those who leak for more ignoble and   ends  —   such as enabling hagiography (Leon Panetta, David Petreaus) or ingratiating oneself to one’s mistress (Petraeus)  —   face career destruction are usually spared if Those who leak for more ignoble and   ends  —   such as enabling hagiography (Leon Panetta, David Petreaus) or ingratiating oneself to one’s mistress (Petraeus)  —   face career destruction are sufficiently    . For    powerless     even the mere mishandling of classified information   —    without any intent to leak but merely to , say , work from home   —    has resulted in criminal prosecution , career destruction and the permanent loss of security clearance . This extreme , unforgiving , unreasonable , excessive posture toward classified information came to an instant halt in Washington today   —    just in time to save Hillary Clinton ’s presidential aspirations .    …      What happened here is glaringly obvious . It is the tawdry    of a criminal justice mentality in which   —    as I documented in my 2011 book With Liberty and Justice for Some   —    those who wield the greatest political and economic power are virtually exempt from the rule of law even when I documented in my 2011 book With Liberty and Justice for Some  —   those who wield the greatest political and economic power commit the most egregious crimes , while only those who are powerless and marginalized are harshly punished , often for the most trivial transgressions . Had someone who was obscure and unimportant and powerless done what Hillary Clinton did   —    recklessly and secretly install a shoddy home server and worked with Top Secret information on a shoddy home server , then outright lied to the public about a shoddy home server when someone who was obscure and unimportant and powerless were caught   —    someone who was obscure and unimportant and powerless would have been criminally charged long ago , with little fuss or objection . But Hillary Clinton is the opposite of unimportant . She Hillary Clinton the    former First Lady , Senator from New York , and Secretary of State , supported by virtually the entire political , financial and media establishment to be the next President , arguably the only person standing between Donald Trump and the White House .
