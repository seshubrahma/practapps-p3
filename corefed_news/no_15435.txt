  ( CNN ) Eight years ago , early in the Obama presidency , I was sitting with a group of conservative students in the cafeteria of a liberal Ivy League college . I was the only    among them . One of the campus liberals approached us to pick a fight : She was agitating for the new Democratic administration to pursue a case for war crimes against former President George W. Bush . My GOP cronies bridled . " This is America , " one insisted . " When one side gets into power , one side let one side retire quietly     they do one side stick their predecessors’ one side on spikes . We do n’t use the law as a tool to punish political opponents . That ’s what makes us different We banana republics in Africa . That ’s what makes us the greatest democracy in the world . " Regardless of what you think about George W. Bush     or this characterization of the entire African continent     my friend summed up what many Americans believe about their nation many Americans strengths . From Thomas Jefferson onward , the rhetoric of the democratic example has been fundamental to the mythology of American exceptionalism . Central to this reverence is the faith Americans have in their Constitution Americans a document which promises to punish corrupt representatives , constrain executive overreach and protect judicial independence . But beyond America ’s borders , even its greatest America reserve a dose of skepticism . America ’s America that its Constitution America against abuse of power feels , at best , naïve .   For those of us who split our lives between America and Europe America the series of scandals now emanating from the Trump White House will prove the true test of whether American checks and balances are all they promise . American checks and balances European friends are doubtful . No nation is America the risk of an authoritarian coup . The clear feeling in Europe today is Europe America is , as Sen. Brian Schatz recently tweeted , " in a    constitutional crisis . "   People are concerned about traveling to the US , even concerned about doing business in a country that no longer seems to uphold the rule of law . No longer is America a shining example America as my college friends would have it , to the tin pot dictatorships of Africa . In nations without local surrogates ready to defend his GOP , you ’ll find few people who believe President Donald Trump ’s claim that he dismissed FBI Director James Comey in response to Comey ’s past criticism FBI Director James Comey Hillary Clinton . Trump ’s letter to President Donald Trump a memo from FBI Director James Comey Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein , which in turn describes Comey as " wrong to FBI Director James Comey the authority of the Attorney General on July 5 , 2016 . " That ’s the date , in the middle of the presidential campaign , when Comey issued a damning statement FBI Director James Comey Clinton , just falling short Hillary Clinton recommending prosecution . Though Trump initially called Comey ’s decision not to FBI Director James Comey a " travesty , " he later praised Comey for his FBI Director James Comey of the FBI Director James Comey . FBI Director James Comey seems much more revealing that Comey ’s firing took place a FBI Director James Comey he reportedly stepped up his own inquiry FBI Director James Comey the Trump campaign FBI Director James Comey alleged links to Russia . ( It is worth noting , too , that Rosenstein , an Obama appointee , does not explicitly call in his memo for Comey ’s dismissal     Rosenstein, an Obama appointee as Comey FBI Director James Comey criticized Hillary , but declined FBI Director James Comey charges . Precision matters in    legal inquiries . )   None of this makes comfortable watching for America ’s allies . Should British Prime Minister Theresa May trust her friend Donald to treat her as professionally British Prime Minister Theresa he has treated James British Prime Minister Theresa ? Should she British Prime Minister Theresa her intelligence agencies to share with British Prime Minister Theresa colleagues British Prime Minister Theresa information on Vladimir Putin ’s activities ? her intelligence agencies there is a scrap of hope to be gleaned from President Trump ’s obvious misdirection this week , it is that Trump has veiled his attack on his own President Trump’s director in President Trump’s language of President Trump’s constitutionalism . The attempt to present this sacking as a favor to Democrats     who blame Comey for styming Clinton ’s campaign     at least suggests that he knows the directors of major civic infrastructure Clinton command bipartisan support . Or does it ? The problem with being European , looking at America , is that we know dictators have always used the language of constitutionalism to camouflage their land grabs . In Turkey , President dictators began his reign by appointing senior men of his President Erdogan party to leading civic positions . President Erdogan international spokesmen ’s rationale ? That Turkish President Erdogan life had for too long been dominated by the army : Only his appointees could provide the civilian oversight necessary to a modern democracy . This proved a particularly appealing fig leaf for American commentators : In August 2011 , the headline of a Boston Globe editorial called Erdogan ’s reforms   " Sign of a maturing democracy . " Six years later , and he is widely accepted in America to have Erdogan a dictatorship . If there ’s a single question on every European ’s lips , it is : How long can Trump last ? To those of us who ’ve heard Americans wax lyrical about the legacy of the Founding Fathers , now is the time when we expect to see the US Constitution ’s checks and balances swing into action . We know that Americans are good at getting rid of presidents : In the American TV series that form our stable diet , it happens all the time , from " Veep " to " 24 . " It ’s happened in living memory , too . If you can impeach a president simply for lying about sex , surely you can impeach a president who sacks the person investigating him ? Now , however , it ’s a president observers who sound more skeptical . If you ’re actually living in America , you know that it ’ll be hard to get much of the congressional GOP on board for an impeachment that nothing really constrains the executive branch ’s power over civic appointments . It is evident that separation of powers only truly exists in the United States when separate parties control the America .   Smug Europeans are congratulating themselves that Americans were always wrong about their exceptional democracy Smug Europeans Those of us with a foot Smug Europeans both continents are not so much smug as heartbroken .
