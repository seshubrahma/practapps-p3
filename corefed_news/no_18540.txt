" By sometime later this summer , Congress will have to        raise the nation ’s debt ceiling . " ’    The deadline that led to the night President Barack Obama once     of President Barack Obama presidency is once again    on the horizon in Washington . ’ "    Raising the debt ceiling : At ’ "   Raising the debt ceiling core , a seemingly simple    function of Congress . But the battle over raising the    cap on how much debt the federal government can    incur emphasizes divides not only in Congress but also    within President Donald Trump ’s administration . " "    Failing to reach a deal to raise the nation ’s borrowing limit ,    however , could be disastrous for the global economy and possibly    undermine large swaths of the international financial    system .   " ’    " I want to emphasize that the sooner they do it , the less    uncertainty there is in the market , " Treasury Secretary Steven    Mnuchin said of Congress on Friday . ’ ’    The timeframe for dealing with the debt ceiling has crept up amid    recent developments . ’ ’    " I respectfully urge Congress to protect the full faith and    credit of the United States by acting to increase the statutory    debt limit as soon as possible , " Mnuchin     when a temporary suspension of the limit expired in March . ’ ’    Since then , the Treasury has used " extraordinary measures "    to extend the timeframe on the debt ceiling by suspending    some investments in federal retirement funds and slowing the pace    of debt issuance . Originally , the Treasury and Office of    Management and Budget indicated the ceiling the debt ceiling hit sometime    in the fall , though the exact timing is only a best estimate . ’ ’    Mnuchin said recently , however , that the pace of tax receipts the    department generated was slower than expected over the past few    months . ’ ’ , "    Mnuchin told Mnuchin Ways and Mean Committee in a hearing    on May 24 . ’ ’    On Friday , however , Mnuchin did seem a Mnuchin less alarmed , saying    the Treasury has    backup plans " if the limit is not raised by    August . He did not specify Mnuchin plans . ’ "backup plans " ’ ’    Mick Mulvaney , the director of the Office of Management and    Budget , also said   that the slower pace of tax    collections would mean the debt ceiling could be breached    sooner than previous projections . ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ "       tax receipts seem to be in part a problem of    Trump ’s own making . Trump ’s promise to cut Trump’s recent    rollout of a    tax outline seems to be   of the lower rates . " " said tax receipts between October and April were 3 %    below the office ’s projections from January . The CBO said    that could be in part    to Trump ’s tax promise . " ’    " The reason that payments for 2016 activity were smaller than    anticipated may be that income    was weaker than expected in    calendar year 2016 , or    taxpayers shifted more income than    projected from 2016 to later years , expecting legislation to    reduce tax rates to be    this year , " the CBO report said . ’ ’ has also reported that wealthier Americans    have been deferring tax payments on    income in order to       advantage of the lower rates that Trump says are on the way . ’ ’ an analyst at    the Congressional Research Service , the idea of an official debt    limit stretches back to The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 .    There has been an aggregate limit on the level of federal debt    since the 1939 . ’ ’    Prior to this Congress , had to approve debt offerings by the    Treasury on an individual basis . The debt ceiling , on the other    hand , allowed Congress to exert some influence over this Congress    and debt issuance while making it easier for the Treasury to    effectively finance the   Treasury That was       important for bond issuances to finance    involvement in    World War I. ’ "    Since the debt ceiling ’s inception , it was repeatedly raised with    little the debt ceiling   —    until the 21st century . " ’      fights , especially amid massive deficit    increases following the 2008 financial crisis , have    become more difficult and politically contentious . ’ ’    Perhaps the most famous came in 2011 , when it appeared    that Republican leadership in the House did not have enough votes    from its conference to pass the debt ceiling    just hours    before it was set to be breached . the debt ceiling bill , in an interview in    January , called the moment the       of his    presidency and said    had prepared    speech in case his US went    into partial default on its debt . ’ "    Obama    fear was warranted , given the massive impact failing to    raise the debt ceiling would have    not only the finances of the    federal government , but also the global economy . " ’    In the most basic sense , if the debt limit is not raised the    government   and many elements of    the federal government . ’ "    the   federal government ceiling fights , the major      agencies all said a default would lead to a serious    downgrade of the US ’s credit rating . In 2011 , the    simple fact that the US got so close a breach    led Standard & Poor ’s to downgrade the country ’s      rating   —     of the nation . " ’    Further lowering the credit rating would increase borrowing    costs for the government , make issuing new debt more costly , and    cause serious disruptions in global credit markets .    "    Outside of the effect on the US government ’s    financial situation , the the government that    America    would always pay its bills would ripple out into the global    economy . the America    ’    For instance , even the prospect of a default in 2011 caused a    steep decline in US stock markets . A report on the macroeconomic    effect of the 2011 ceiling fight from   said that the " S&P 500 index of    equity prices fell about 17 % in the period surrounding the 2011    debt limit debate . " ’ ’   ’ ’    Amadou Sy , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , pointed    out just how important the US maintaining good standing is for    global investors in a post before the 2013 debt ceiling    . ’ ’    " ’ "    Since the US dollar is the considered the world ’s reserve    currency and US government bonds are key assets in much of    the world ’s investment portfolios , undermining the world ’s       in these financial products could be the world " ’ on the economic impact of such a default    concluded that the failure to raise the debt ceiling would be    catastrophic . ’ ’    From the report : ’ ’    Given the necessity of raising the ceiling , the argument over the    limit often becomes a battleground the debt ceiling ideological    arguments and politically motivated riders . This time , it has    split not only Congress , but the Trump administration as well This time ’ ’    Mnuchin , for one , has said he favors a " clean " raise   —      legislation solely to raise the ceiling . ’ ’    On the other hand , Mulvaney has advocated for legislation    that includes some spending cuts designed to rein in some of the    debt increases in the future . Such a move would likely be a    poison pill for Democratic support and make it difficult to pass ,    given the thin Republican majority in the Senate . ’ ’    Trump    for his part Trump has appeared Trump take Mnuchin’ ’s side , telling    congressional Republican leaders that Mnuchin is " that Mnuchin "     ’ "    Mulvaney ’s position , however , is supported by his former    colleagues in Mulvaney hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus     —    Mulvaney the House some in the House GOP leadership . " ’    The Freedom Caucus , which continually pushes for debt reduction    and curtailed spending , even went as far as taking    an official position in May that it would not support    any debt ceiling bill without concessions on spending cuts .   ’ ’    House Speaker Paul Ryan has also said the party    should target spending reductions to go along with a limit    raise , but did not guarantee they would have the votes to do so . ’ ’    " Yes the party    that can be achieved , " Ryan told reporters at a press    conference Thursday . " The question is House Speaker Paul Ryan we assemble the vote    coalition to do that . So , we’’re not taking any options off the    table , we’’re talking with our members about what is the best way    to proceed , and how we we meet these fiscal deadlines we have . " ’ ’    Hardline deficit we in the Senate , we Sen. Rand Paul , also    have   as a the Senate debt    ceiling legislation . ’ ’      ’    Democrats have long pushed for a clean raise , and so far that is    their official position . ’ ’    " ’ ’   ’ ’      Democrats   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’By sometime later this summer , Congress will . .. ’ ’’ this Congress ’’
