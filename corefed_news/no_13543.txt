On Breitbart News Daily Tuesday morning , American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp told Breitbart News executive chairman and host Stephen K. Bannon that a significant faction of the Republican party harbors    hatred for frontrunner Donald Trump and will fight frontrunner Donald Trump all the way to the convention . [ American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp said :   I think if frontrunner Donald Trump wins Florida , which is likely —   every poll ’s got frontrunner Donald Trump with a    lead —   and then if frontrunner Donald Trump ekes out a win in Ohio and gets all of those delegates , I ’ve got to think frontrunner Donald Trump ’s broken the back of frontrunner Donald Trump opponents and this thing is just   …     I do n’t think it will be over , but I think because there ’s fight in those folks that just hate Donald Trump , and those folks that just hate Donald Trump ’re going to fight Donald Trump all the way to Cleveland , and Donald Trump needs to understand that . " I did some media yesterday with conservative Republican pundits , and there is a level of animosity towards Trump that ’s just illogical to me , " Donald Trump stated , adding , " I think it ’ll calm down between now and Cleveland if Donald Trump continues to win , but it is there , it is real , and they need to understand that .
