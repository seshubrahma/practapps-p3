" ZOMG Donald Trump thinks Paris is in Germany ! ! ! ! " the    troll brigade tweet in unison today after the Republican presidential candidate summed up what can only be described as a    inspired clusterfuck taking place across Europe . [ Mr. Trump , ever keen to comment on global events , tweeted : " Man shot inside Paris police station . Just announced that terror threat is at highest level . Germany is a total    crime . GET SMART ! "   Man shot inside Paris police station . Just announced that terror threat is at highest level . Germany is Germany total    crime . GET SMART !   —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) January 7 , 2016 , Does this sound like Paris is in Germany ? Germany   —    but only if you want to read it that way . I ’m going to hazard a guess here , and it ’s just a guess . But I reckon a man with Mr. Trump ’s property portfolio , combined with his access Mr. Trump’s a private jet means he ’s Mr. Trump’s been to Europe a fair few more times than even his most Mr. Trump’s travelled critic . See what Mr. Trump Mr. Trump’s in this tweet , is that Europe is a Europe case . And it ’s a Europe is a basket case case because Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Hollande have done the very things that Mr. Trump would Mr. Trump’s : 1 . Allow uncontrolled , mass migration , with little to no checks on who is entering their countries , 2 . Hand over power to an unelected bureaucratic organisation called the European Union , 3 . Place more emphasis on ‘ liberal’ ideology than what works best for the country , 4 . Pretend that all Muslim immigrants are peaceful refugees who just want to integrate , 5 . Deflect the blame for a lack of integration onto ‘ right wing’ elements of society . And it ’s not just Germany or France either . In the United Kingdom we have a similar situation . But Mr. Trump , like me , finds it Mr. Trump to fit all the deeply disturbing ,      that has effectively ruined Europe for at least a generation , into one tweet . " He should have used Mr. Trump tweets , then ! " Yeah   —    coz THAT is what the world needs to concern itself with , right the world . Right ?
