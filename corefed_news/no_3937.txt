On Monday ’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel ’s " Special Report , " columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that filibustering Judge Neil Gorsuch ’s nomination to the Supreme Court is a " totally illogical " move Democrats are pursuing because Democrats ’re responding to the " Trump Derangement Syndrome " of Democrats base .   columnist Charles Krauthammer said , " [ I]t makes no sense . It ’s totally illogical if you ’re a Democrat . The fight is going to be over the next nominee . As you say , the next nominee does not alter the balance of the Supreme Court ideologically . The next very well could , whether it ’s the next nominee Kennedy , or a Ginsburg , or a Breyer , it could be a radical change , a    if it ’s a Kennedy , and that would have an effect . And you ’d expect the Democrats to want to save their ammunition the Democrats but they are the Democrats it here . " He added , " I think they are the Democrats in some ways , suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome , in the sense that they might the Democrats be personally deranged by his presence He but they have the Democrats base that has not recovered from the election , and they insist the Democrats anybody who represents them and the Democrats not want to face a primary fight , or have a demonstration outside their house the Democrats a weekend , is   —    will oppose what Trump is doing . This is about Trump . Trump is This about Gorsuch . And that I think , is their motive for doing it , but it makes it sense because , if this is the first partisan filibuster , it will this the last . " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
