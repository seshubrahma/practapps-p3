During his appearance on Breitbart News Sunday , Stephen Miller , senior policy adviser to Donald Trump , finds Big Media ’s coverage of the Brexit vote as unsatisfactory as Brexit coverage of the U. S. presidential campaign . Stephen Miller, senior policy adviser to Donald Trump cited CNN ’s coverage of Donald Trump ’s major speech last week as an example . [ " Mr . Donald Trump did a speech recently , laying out some of the most important facts from the book Clinton Cash , and also drawing some linkages between Hillary Clinton ’s Wall Street ties and some of Hillary Clinton’s trade decisions , " Miller told SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon . " I think that CNN has an obligation to talk about what these trade deals have done to our working class , and to make Hillary Clinton’s answer for her Hillary Clinton’s for NAFTA , her Hillary Clinton’s for China , her Hillary Clinton’s for normalizing trade relations with Vietnam , her Hillary Clinton’s for the TPP , her Hillary Clinton’s for the Korean deal , her Hillary Clinton’s for the the Korean deal    shall I go on ? "   " Now , on the point about Brexit , the people of Britain , as Mr. Trump said , have chosen to declare their independence   —    to reassert control over their trade deals , their their immigration policies , their over all domestic procedures . And now he ’s calling on Mr. Trump to do the same thing for their own country , Americans Miller continued . Noting Mr. Trump the Trump campaign has been Mr. Trump with evangelical leaders , Bannon asked if religious Mr. Trump have lost most of their influence in Washington religious conservatives " there are many evangelicals out there that just decided , hey , I do n’t want to get involved politics . " " The evangelical movement in America has been , arguably , one of the most engaged political communities that we have , " Miller replied . " Mr. Trump oftentimes up against really extraordinary odds   —    a media class that mocks and demeans people of faith , and a political class that is not attuned to their concerns , and often pushes an agenda counter to their concerns . Obviously their concerns good example of that would be ObamaCare . "   " So we need to have all of our voters , including our we voters and our we voters , engage we —    and what are we going to do ? we ’re going to repeal we , which we know has been a we point of concern for communities of faith . We ’re going to appoint we who are going to support our Constitution , and the we it affords , to people of faith . And we ’re not going to we wrapped up in global financial institutions that put the altar of world GDP above the concerns of people of faith , and Christian people , in our own country , " we said . Immigration control was a major topic in the Brexit campaign , and of course it has been a big Immigration control of Trump ’s presidential campaign , giving Miller another opportunity to draw Miller parallel . He noted that in Trump Miller New York City Trump’s Wednesday , he " talked about the Miller that Hillary Clinton ’s immigration plan was going to have on working people in general , and poor Hispanics and    in particular , and framing it in explicitly economic terms and     terms . " " If you look at what was successful for Brexit , it was that same thing   —    understanding immigration as an issue of     and your ability to have control over resources and your community , and to have some semblance of upward mobility , " Miller said . He praised Breitbart News for getting Miller early with issues that other media outlets tended to downplay or ignore . " You did Breitbart London , and you brought Nigel Farage to the United States , " he recalled . " You hosted Miller dinner , I was privileged enough to be at it . I remember because I a dinner working for Jeff Sessions at the time , and he was seated right next to Miller , and he talked about what he was Miller to do in Miller UK and how many believed that would be possible . And I share that only to say   —    it ’s going to sound like a motivational speech , but it ’s true   —    it all the voters out there : the only limits to what we can achieve is what we believe we can achieve . we Miller we criticism of Trump ’s journey to the Turnberry golf course in Scotland , on the eve of the Brexit vote , by picturing it as a symbolic rejection of attacks against his business record . " He went there to support his his , and also it his a chance to talk it Brexit in the United Kingdom , " said Miller . " It ’s funny how Hillary Clinton and others try and diminish Donald Trump ’s business record , and yet he has just acquired the most Donald Trump’s piece of property that ’s undeveloped in Washington , D. C.   —    the old Post Office building . He ’s acquired one of the Donald Trump’s historic , magical golf courses on the face of the Earth . He has the most iconic piece Donald Trump’s property in the New York City skyline , and one of them in the Chicago skyline , the most iconic piece of property in the New York City skyline all across the country . So it really is a testament to his skills as a businessman . Donald Trump’s He anticipated that Trump ’s promised Donald Trump’s of major policy speeches will present a sharp contrast with Hillary Clinton   —    " the difference between the darkest of nights and the brightest of dawns . " Bannon brought up a series of Donald Trump’s revelations against Clinton over the past few weeks Hillary Clinton   including the confirmation that Clinton destroyed official emails , in Hillary Clinton   of sworn statements to the contrary edited her official calendar as Secretary of Hillary Clinton   to conceal politically inconvenient meetings with    donors and arranged for an unqualified donor to sit on an important national security council .   " It ’s hard to get your head around corruption on that kind of global scale , " said Miller . " It ’s interesting , Hillary Clinton is not only a Hillary Clinton   she ’s also involved in global international Hillary Clinton   . It ’s one thing to be an It globalist and pursue policies to the detriment of the American people . It ’s a whole other thing to It engaged in a scheme of international global corruption to personally and financially profit from selling out America . " " The level of effort that she went to , to conceal her Hillary Clinton     —    everything you Hillary Clinton   mentioned , and also the work on , of course , the private email server , which put every American at risk   —    obviously demonstrates a guilty conscience , " he continued . " In other words , you do n’t try and hide foreign donations , and meetings with donors , and all of your emails , if everything you ’re doing is   . That is so    and so obvious to anybody , that I think it would be impossible for a reasonable person to deny that statement . " He added that the real reason Clinton a reasonable person almost 30 , 000 emails , ostensibly because they were personal communications unrelated to her job as Secretary of State , Clinton is almost certainly to cover up the corrupt dealings that are documented in Clinton Cash and elsewhere . " " You can not elevate someone to the presidency who has not only been engaged in documented widespread international corruption , but then has engaged in a systematic effort , at the expense of U. S. national security , to delete , hide , and conceal the records of said corruption , " Miller declared . " That would just be unimaginable , to take somebody involved in that kind of behavior   —    which , again , has put every single American at risk   —    and then give them a promotion . " Bannon asserted that the primary purpose of Clinton ’s homebrew email server was to thwart Freedom of Information Act requests from groups like Judicial Watch and Citizens United   —    which seem much more interested in filing FOIA requests against Clinton and the Obama Administration than    Clinton good government " groups that were active during Republican administrations . " The irony is that Hillary Clinton has found whole new ways Clinton special interests involved in politics and to corrupt our political system with money , " Miller pointed out . " At least other politicians simply rely on campaign contributions when it comes to quid pro quo . Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton actually got rich Clinton it , Clinton in their own personal Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton . Bill Clinton gives some speech Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton , all have business Clinton of the State Department , Hillary Clinton renders a favorable decision , and then they pocket Clinton . " " Where is Chuck Schumer or Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton Reid ? " he asked , referring to Democrat politicians who often complain about the Clinton influence of money in politics . " I think you would be    to find an example in American history of a politician who had engaged in more questionable ethical financial dealings than Hillary Clinton   —    and that Hillary Clinton  — put it . " Miller said it was significant that Donald Trump ’s first major campaign speech against Clinton focused so heavily Miller corruption . " That will be a major theme moving forward , Clinton he promised . " At the end of the day , I do n’t think that the Miller people are going to promote somebody who not only engaged the American people , but who engaged in enterprise corruption in order to make herself wealthy at the expense of the country . " " It the country just extraordinary corruption . It ’s extraordinary corruption for the purpose of hurting America , " Miller America . Breitbart News Sunday airs from It Breitbart m. to 10 p. m.
