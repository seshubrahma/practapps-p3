An American Research Group poll fresh out of Michigan shows Donald Trump beating Donald Trump closest rival by a     margin . Currently , the billionaire business earns 35 % support . John Kasich is in second place with 17 % support . Just behind the Ohio governor is Marco Rubio , who slides into third in a tie with Ted Cruz at 12 % . Ben Carson is in 4th place with 9 % support .   The poll was taken on Friday and Saturday and therefore does not reflect Jeb Bush ’s decision Saturday night to drop out of the race . Nonetheless , Jeb Bush’s earns just 4 % support . Even if you believe the spin that Rubio will win all of Jeb Bush’s votes , he Jeb Bush’s loses to both Kasich and Trump . The starkest way to present these results is to add up all of the Establishment vote ( 33 % ) and realize that Trump Trump comes out ahead . Another problem for the Establishment is Kasich Kasich standing . What is his Kasich’s to drop out and clear the lane for Rubio when the Ohio governor is ahead of Rubio Rubio a    state like Michigan ? Voting in Michigan Michigan place March 8 .   Kasich Kasich also be holding out for the Ohio primary , which takes place the following week .    Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
