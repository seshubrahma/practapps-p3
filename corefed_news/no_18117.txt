’   ’ "    The revelation that the chairman of the House Intelligence    Committee , Devin Nunes , was on White House grounds the day before    Fox briefed President Donald Trump on documents related to    surveillance of Fox transition team has fueled speculation that    the White House itself was Nunes’ source . " ’    Nunes , who was a member of Trump’ ’s transition team , told Fox on    Tuesday afternoon that Fox would " never reveal " the source of the    classified documents Fox obtained , not even to other members of    the House Intelligence Committee . ’ ’    Nunes on Monday said Nunes had gone to the White House last week to    view the   classified documents he obtained because Congress didn’’t have " networked    access " to those reports . ’ ’    His Nunes later told Business Insider that Nunes Nunes       there to view the the   classified documents he obtained a secure compartmented    information facility , or SCIF , to " safeguard the proper chain of    custody and classification of these documents , " but did not    respond    asked why an executive branch source would not go    directly    Trump , instead of to Nunes , with documents they found    suspicious    ’ ’    Nunes has Nunes that no one from the Trump administration Trump    he    Nunes White House grounds being briefed on the documents . But      experts , Republican and Democratic members of    Congress , and White House White House said it is highly    unlikely Nunes could Nunes gone unnoticed on White House grounds White House ’    " This is insane , " Juliette Kayyem , a CNN      analyst and former official at the Department of Homeland    Security , told Business Insider on Monday . " You only go to the    White House to get White House the White House . It’ the   White House meeting    point like a McDonald’ ’s off the turnpike . " ’ ’    Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell , a member of the House Intelligence    Committee ,   on Tuesday morning . The White    House " is not the   White House " Swalwell told MSNBC . " Nunes just walk in and receive classified information . " ’ "    Swalwell also wondered why Nunes could n’t have viewed the    documents inside an SCIF at the Capitol after consulting with his    fellow committee members . " ’    " If this Nunes done the proper way , they could have brought it    over , shared it with both ’    of the committee this " he said , this referencing what he said was the bipartisan nature    which         are typically    . ’ ’    If you’’re a member of Congress visiting the White House ,    " everyone in the building knows that you’’re there in the    building , " Swalwell said . " you’’re is what a    to a crime    looks like . " ’ ’    " None of us , Democrat or Republican , on the Senate Intelligence    Committee still has any idea what [ Nunes is ] talking about , " Sen.    Mark Warner , the committee’ ’s ranking Democrat , told reporters on    Tuesday . " I don’’t believe , frankly , the members , Republican or    Democrat , on the House committee do either . " ’ ’   ’ ’    " To come onto these grounds at the White House , you must be    authorized , " Jeff Zeleny , CNN’ ’s senior White House    ,    said on Tuesday . " Someone invited him in , cleared    in , Tuesday escorted him in .    White House has    the decision    not    say who the White House " ’ "    Republican Sen. John McCain agreed that Nunes’ move was unusual . " ’    " I’’ve been around for quite a while , and I’’ve never heard of any    such thing , " he said on Tuesday I’’ve on CBS . ’ ’    White House press I’’ve Sean Spicer said on Tuesday that    while he didn’’t know who Nunes spoke to , any conversations the    congressman had White House press secretary Sean Spicer a source   —    assuming that person had security    clearance   —    were " 100 % legal " and " completely appropriate . " ’ ’    The day after he went to the White House , Nunes announced in an     that the the   congressman president and his advisers may have Nunes their communications    " incidentally collected " by the Nunes community during the    the   president and his advisers period . ’ ’    Nunes said the reports he had seen had nothing to do with Russia , Nunes which is why Nunes felt comfortable briefing Trump on the matter    without first informing the ranking Nunes of the House    Intelligence Committee , Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff . ’ ’    Schiff joined a growing chorus of Democrats   from the    committee’ ’s investigation Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff whether the Trump campaign    colluded with Russia , saying in a statement that " none Trump the    committee members   —    Democrats or Republicans   —    has seen the    relevant documents , now almost a week later . " ’ ’    " There was no legitimate justification for bringing that    information to the White House instead of the committee , " Schiff    added .
