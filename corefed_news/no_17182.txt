  ( CNN ) Fidel Castro Ruz , the political personality , has died . Fidel Castro , the historical persona , has been born . Fidel Castro passes from the present into the past , to serve as an enduring historical subject of debate and dispute , about whom dispassion will be impossible for years to come . Fidel Castro was not a man about whom one is likely to be neutral .             Fidel Fidel Castro a metaphor . He Fidel Castro a Rorschach blot upon which to project fears or hopes .   A prism in which the spectrum of colors refracted out has to do with light that went in . He Fidel Castro a point of view , loaded with ideological purport and political meaning . A David who survived Goliath . A symbol of Third World intransigence against First World domination .   But it is also possible to discuss the historical " essences " of Fidel Castro . He Fidel Castro out of a history shaped by a century of Cuban national frustration , heir to a legacy of unfulfilled hopes for national sovereignty and    aspirations that put Cuba on a collision course with the United States . The collision of the early 1960s served to fix the trajectory of the 50 years of ruptured relations that followed .    There was something deeply personal about the   . S. estrangement .   Fidel Castro offended American sensibilities . The sheer effrontery of Castro Fidel Castro to the the United States breathtaking : defiant , strident , often virulent denunciations of the United States the United States a time , day after day , stretching into weeks and months , and years . Castro ’s invective was more than Fidel Castro reciprocated by American vilification . Fidel Castro was held personally responsible Fidel Castro all the challenges the United States faced in the United States America , in the Caribbean , in Africa . Castro was transformed simultaneously into an anathema and phantasma Fidel Castro unscrupulous and perhaps unbalanced , possessed by demons and given to evil doings . He defied years of US efforts at regime change Fidel Castro his very defiance transformed him into something of an Fidel Castro national obsession . Fidel Castro occupied a place of almost singular distinction in Fidel Castro netherworld to which the United States banished its demons .    He was the man Americans the United States to hate political Fidel Castro personalized decades of frustration over the US’ unsuccessful attempts to force Cuba to bend its   will     all this vented on one Cuba . Certainly , scores of assassination plots against the life of Castro could not have made American wrath any more personal .    And , yes : the missiles of October 1962 . Castro would never be forgiven . It is highly Castro that any American administration could have embarked on a    rapprochement American Fidel Castro in power . His death leaves something Castro void in Cuba . Castro in the form of a power vacuum , of course , but as the absence of a voice and the loss of a presence .    Even old , feeble and in failing health , beset with infirmities , and perhaps with traces of senility , Fidel continued to discharge the role of symbol .   He was suspicious of President Barack Obama ’s rapprochement initiatives Fidel He no doubt would have been alarmed by the campaign Fidel of    Donald Trump .    The Republican Party platform inaugurated the 2016 electoral campaign prepared to welcome " Cuba back into our hemispheric family after their corrupt rulers are forced from power and brought to our hemispheric family for their crimes against humanity . "   The    vowed their corrupt rulers roll back all " concessions " The Republican Party Cuba unless the " regime meets our demands , " demands Cuba include " religious and political freedom for the Cuban people . "    At this stage of    relations , the very proposition of American " demands " on Cuba bode ill for continued normalization .   A people who Cuba endured 60 years of privation over the course of 11 presidential administrations in defense of national sovereignty and    will not likely acquiesce to demands of a 12th administration .    In passing from the present to the past , Fidel will henceforth speak from the grave .
