’   ’ "    DAVOS , Switzerland   —    Three days before Donald Trump is set to be    inaugurated as the 45th US president , a world power with which Donald Trump    has taken an    adversarial approach has become the    unlikely leader at the world ’s most visible gathering of economic    elites . " ’    Xi Jinping on Tuesday became the first Chinese president to    attend the World Economic Forum in Davos . ’ ’    " Whether you like it or not , the global economy is the big ocean    you can’’t escape from , " Xi said in delivering the forum’ ’s opening    plenary speech , introduced by the forum’ ’s founder and chair ,    Klaus Schwab . ’ "    Xi established   Xi as an unlikely defender of the      global order that Trump and others have dismissed on the way to    electoral victories .   Xi addressed a crowd full of business    leaders and politicians , but   Xi message was squarely aimed at    one person : Trump , who on the campaign trail excoriated China ’s    trade policies and threatened to slap a   on Chinese imports . " ’    " No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war , "   Xi said , drawing    applause from the crowd . ’ ’’ "    China and Xi have taken a leading role at this year ’s forum , with    several of China ’s biggest business leaders   —          Alibaba ’s Jack Ma and Dalian Wanda ’s Wang Jianlin   —    and many of    the ’s forum panels focusing on China China evolving role in the    world . " "    In an unusual turn of events , Xi ’s speech drew a sharp rebuke to    an incoming American administration that has advocated    protectionist trade policies and discussed withdrawing from    global    agreements . He cast Xi as a    solution for various problems in the world , including the refugee    crisis in the Middle East and Africa . He said Xi financial    crisis resulted not from economic globalization but from    excessive   . " ’    " There’ ’s no point in blaming economic globalization for the    world’ ’s problems , " Xi said . He spent Xi portion of his speech Xi directly warning against the path of protectionism , comparing it    the path of protectionism " locking oneself in a dark room . " ’ ’    " While wind and rain may be kept outside , so too are light and    air , " he said Xi ’ ’    At the same time , representation from the incoming Trump    administration was virtually nonexistent at a forum of global    elites that represents much of what he campaigned against during    his successful he run . ’ ’    Anthony Scaramucci , the prominent New York financier who last    week accepted a top post in the White House , was set to speak    later    at the forum a forum of global   elites that represents much of what he campaigned against during   his successful presidential run he is attending he an unofficial    capacity , according to event organizers . Most of the US    representation at Davos remains from the Obama administration ,    including Vice    Joe Biden and Secretary of State John    Kerry . ’ ’    Xi’ ’s    speech also came at a time of burgeoning    tensions between China and the new US government . Trump   when he    spoke Trump   Taiwan’ ’s leader , and he has continued Trump   leave open    the US’    " One China " policy China which states that Taiwan is part of    a single China . ’ ’    Two leading    newspapers threatened earlier this week    that China would " China off the gloves " if Trump continued on his    current Trump with respect to Taiwan , calling the One China policy     China ’
