Noam Chomsky tells me on @ajupfront that leftists who did n’t vote for Clinton to block Trump made a " bad mistake" : pic . twitter .   In an interview with Al Jazeera ’s Mehdi Hasan ,    Noam Chomsky said progressives who did n’t vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Clinton a bad mistake " by not recognizing    Donald Trump ’s " greater evil . "   Chomsky said Noam Chomsky " I think they are making a bad mistake . First of all there is two issues . One is kind of a moral issue . Do you vote against the greater evil if you do n’t happen to like the other candidate ? They answer to they is yes , if you have any moral understanding , you want to keep the greater evil the greater evil question is a factual question . How do Trump and Clinton compare ? And I think they are very different . Trump and Clinton did n’t like Clinton at all but her Clinton are much better Clinton Trump ’s on every issue I can think of .
