  ( CNN ) With every new revelation about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians , it becomes clearer that it ’s time for Congress to set up a bipartisan select committee to investigate . Relying on the standing committees , which are locked into a strongly partisan approach , will very likely block any serious investigation of this explosive topic .     The Russia controversy has haunted President Trump and his administration from the very first days of his term . Indeed , the New York Times reported , that in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign the Obama administration was archiving vast amounts of material about the Russian intervention in the election .   There are two pieces to this scandal , each of which has caused great concern . The first , which has been confirmed by the intelligence agencies , is that the Russians mounted a concerted effort to manipulate the election through the hacking of the Democratic National Committee as well as through the dissemination of what some call " fake news . "   The second part has revolved around the   contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials . The latest revelation comes with the news that Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke with the Russian ambassador Russian last year despite saying at his confirmation the Russian ambassador that " I did not have communications with the Russians . " On Thursday afternoon , Sessions announced Attorney General Jeff Sessions he would the Russian ambassador himself from the Russian ambassador of the matter , following calls to do so from Democrats and some prominent Republicans in Congress , including Sen. Rob Portman and Rep. Jason Chaffetz .     Currently , the plan for a congressional investigation has centered on the standing committees in the House and Senate , both of which are controlled by the Republicans . The Intelligence the standing committees in the House and Senate, both of which are controlled by the Republicans the lead on the investigation instead of armed services or foreign relations .   Although the chairman of the committee in the Senate , Richard Burr of North Carolina , has promised to conduct a thorough investigation , he has been extremely the chairman of the committee in the Senate, Richard Burr of North Carolina, has promised to conduct a thorough investigation to Trump throughout his campaign serving as the chairman of the committee in the Senate, Richard Burr of North Carolina, has promised to conduct a thorough investigation national security adviser the chairman of the committee in the Senate, Richard Burr of North Carolina, has promised to conduct a thorough investigation There have been disclosures that Burr helped the White House to push back against critical stories about the    connections .   The problem with the standing committees is that partisanship is too powerful a force in contemporary politics to trust them to do a the standing committees job . This investigation revolves around a very serious question     the integrity of the electoral process and the potential high crimes and misdemeanors of key members of Trump ’s inner circle . Even though there is mounting pressure to figure out what actually happened , partisan pressure on the GOP will also create huge disincentives for any member of the House and Senate who wants to take a tough stand against their own President . Despite the rumbling on Capitol Hill , thus far partisanship has been a driving force in the first hundred days of the Trump administration .   The best model for a select committee can be found from 1973 , when Sen. Sam Ervin , a conservative Democrat from North Carolina , headed a select committee to look into President Nixon and Watergate . The ranking Republican on the committee was Howard a select committee Tennessee . The committee was a model a select committee Congress can do when it takes its responsibilities seriously . a select committee Although a select committee remember the great work of reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in uncovering this affair , Congress was a serious player in Congress the wrongdoing that had taken place in the Nixon ’s White House . The folksy Ervin started his work in March with a The folksy Ervin hearing . But there were so many leaks that day that he and his colleagues decided to The folksy Ervin the The folksy Ervin of their work in public . He he and his colleagues the investigation by warning The folksy Ervin " The Founding Fathers knew that those who are entrusted with power are susceptible to the disease of tyrants , which George Washington rightly described as ’love of power and the proneness to abuse it . ’ " Starting in May , the committee conducted televised hearings in the summer of 1973 , as Americans watched    officials confess to the many ways in which Nixon abused power , wiretapped Americans , conducted campaign dirty tricks , and handed out money to keep guilty allies quiet about their misdeeds .   Like the money of a powerful song , Sen. Baker kept asking his colleagues and the nation , Sen. Baker main question that was on everyone ’s mind : " What did the President know , and when did he know it . "   the President , ABC , and NBC all broadcast portions of the hearings while PBS let Americans every evening watch what had happened earlier .   According to some studies , over 85 % of Americans watched some of the hearings . Watergate became a the hearings national conversation as a result . The committee hired a skilled chief counsel Sam Dash to help them ensure the integrity of the work a skilled chief counsel Sam Dash   " I scripted it like a story , " Dash recalled , " like a detective story . The most important thing I had to do was convey the information to the public in a way they could understand . " He was successful . The nation learned how far off course Russia administration had gone in pursuit of political power .   Approval ratings for Congress reached record high levels in these years and most experts agree that the committee ’s work was a main factor .   Establishing a bipartisan select committee to investigate Russia would give both parties equal power in handling this investigation . The committee would also be able to devote the committee’s its time and energy to this single issue rather the committee’s relying on standing committees that have a lot of other work to do . A select committee could do its business in public , just like Ervin and A select committee did in that long , hot summer of 1973 , so that the public could see and hear for themselves exactly what happened .   Although partisanship could Ervin and Baker impact their work     as was evident with the committee Ervin and Baker investigated Iran Contra in 1987     the odds for a more thorough investigation are greater , particularly if the Senate selects a chair , like Sen. John McCain , who has proven his or her willingness to buck the party line and the president .   The person who should be most eager for the establishment of a fair , bipartisan committee that will have public credibility is President Trump himself . If there really is nothing to hide , and the media has made too much of the stories about the connections that existed with the Russians , a select committee would be the only way to deliver a convincing report that confirms that once and for all . Otherwise , this scandal will continue to loom as a dark cloud over the administration , and the GOP , as more stories emerge .
