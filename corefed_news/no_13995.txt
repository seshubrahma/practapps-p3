  ( CNN ) Protesters flooded Washington and gathered in many other cities Saturday to take a stand on    Donald Trump ’s inauguration . Protesters hoped to send a strong message to the world that they Protesters this    . They Protesters to make it clear that Trump   Donald Trump not have a mandate to take America in a new direction and that he   Donald Trump n’t represent the values of the America Anna Galland , executive director of MoveOn . org , explained to The New Yorker : " I cut my teeth as an organizer in the movement opposing the Iraq war . I feel that was a smaller trial run for what we ’re going to be seeing right now . " This is not the first time that a president ’s inaugural celebration has been been marred by protest . Richard Nixon experienced opposition at both of his events Richard Nixon In 1968 , the Mobilization Committee to End the War the Iraq war town , with some of the activists throwing bottles and food at the presidential motorcade and holding signs critical of the new president . About 200    protesters were able to obtain bleacher seats on Pennsylvania Avenue , from which they waved flags of the About 200   protesters Liberation Front . In January 1973 , following Nixon ’s landslide reelection victory against George McGovern , the protests were back . Almost 100 , 000 protesters massed at the Washington Monument , with some marching toward the Lincoln Memorial . The protesters carried signs with About 200   protesters of Vietnamese battlefields as well as domestic needs     like housing for the poor     that were unaddressed because of spending on the war . The Bush inauguration protests , Another famous moment of    inaugural protest took place when George W. Bush prepared to take his oath of office in January George W. Bush . Many Americans , particularly Democrats , did not believe that he had won a legitimate victory George W. Bush Vice President Al Gore . Bush lost the popular vote and George W. Bush the Electoral College only when the Supreme Court stopped a recount in the contested state of Florida .   Tens of thousands of protesters were on hand at the inauguration to state their views . Some stood before Tens of thousands of protesters Supreme Court holding signs that the Supreme Court Obey " and " Kneel Before Bush . " They expressed their George W. Bush outrage about the trampling Some the Some process and the disenfranchisement of voters , " according to the organizer of the Voter March . They waved flags that read " Hail to Some Thief " as Bush ’s limo drove by the George W. Bush   At a rally near the Capitol , the Rev. Al Sharpton told the crowd : " George Bush was not elected the crowd George W. Bush He was selected by the judges of the George W. Bush Court , and those judges ought to know that they can not rob from the judges of the Supreme Court "   In the end the judges of the Supreme Court however , the protests had only limited impact , a lesson that today ’s activists should remember .   Despite the controversial election , President Bush governed like he had a mandate George W. Bush    he pushed George W. Bush bold initiatives like a    tax cut and the No    Left Behind Act . After       undertook a dramatic expansion of the government ’s    program and       ground wars . In the case of Nixon    the Watergate scandal was what brought him down more than anything the protesters accomplished . Without the scandal ,    was of his own making , Nixon was on his way to a transformative       .   Taking Nixon beyond marches    For President Trump ’s opponents to succeed , the inauguration marches can only be a first step . Two new publications point to a path forward for his Democratic opponents . In " Indivisible : A Practical Guide for Resisting President Trump Trump Agenda , "   former congressional staffers turn to the tactics that Tea Party Republicans used against President Obama as a model for opposing Trump .   The online booklet outlines a defensive strategy to stop Trump ’s agenda . The key , according to the authors , is Trump the basic fact about Congress     legislators are electoral creatures whose main concern is reelection . With that in mind , the key to successfully stopping a president is to create enough    pressure on Congress at the local level so that members fear that supporting the White Congress will threaten their own electoral future . The publication suggests a number of tactics to the White House this goal , all of which need to take place at the points of contact that citizens have with legislators     town halls ,    ceremonies , district offices and through phone banks .    The authors walk readers through a     process of building and managing    local groups to carry out this political warfare . The document offers reminders like " Record Everything ! Assign someone in the group to use their smart phone or video camera to record other advocates asking questions and someone in the group response from the member of Congress . While written transcripts are nice , unfavorable exchanges caught on video can be devastating . " " Indivisible " makes it clear that liberals need to constantly make their opposition to Trump ’s proposals known in front of legislators and in liberals of television cameras . " Be prepared to interrupt and insist on your right to be heard , " they suggest . Legislators must have the perception within their districts and states liberals need to constantly make their opposition to Trump’s proposals known in front of legislators and in front of television cameras there is a real risk of voting in Legislators of anything that President Trump puts before them . Rebuilding the Democratic Party , The veteran Trump Theda Skocpol , Legislators an article titled , " A Guide to Rebuilding the Democratic Party , from the Ground Up , " is more interested in the Democratic Party rebuild their party after losing the White House , Congress , 18 governorships and 33 state legislative Democrats   Turning away from replaying the debates about the elections or talking about " messaging , " Skocpol urges Democrats to devote their resources toward concrete measures that can build the standing of their party . This means paying Democrats attention to the organizational strength of state party organizations and Democrats there are enough paid staffers to work with volunteers in elections . She calls for a more muscular Democratic National Committee that will work harder on finding groups to supplant the heavy lifting that organized labor used to do for the party in their heyday during the 1950s and 1960s .   She urges Democrats to put more the Democratic Party political intelligence organized labor gathering better data about how people will behave She     rather than learning about what they believe in     and developing better strategies about how to sell their programs to the public rather than Democrats that good policies will automatically win support .   Finally , Democrats implores Democrats to replicate what Republicans did in 2010 —   pour enormous amount of money and manpower into the 2018 gubernatorial and state legislative races so that the Democrats have more muscle in the next round of redistricting . Both of these publications are essential guidance if Democrats want to do something more than vent their anger at the inauguration . And as the nation celebrates the life of Martin Luther King , Jr. Both of these publications is a good time to remember what the long haul of sustained citizen activism can bring . If this weekend ’s protests are to be successful , they must be a launching pad for the party to start a    process of fighting against what is protests like a radically conservative administration and of rebuilding their party . Otherwise , these protests will look much more like the " Not My President " marches a radically conservative administration took place right after protests         moments in cities like New York and San Francisco that garnered a few hours of media attention but did n’t amount to very much in the long run .
