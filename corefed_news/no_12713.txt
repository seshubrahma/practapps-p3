In a new survey , a    organization called PRRI put an interesting spin on the traditional " right track , wrong track " polling question by asking if " American culture and way of life have changed for the worse or better since the 1950s . " It turns out a slim majority think the Fifties were better , by 51 % to 48 % . [ This is a new angle because pollsters usually ask if the country is on the " wrong track " without giving a specific example of what the " right track " would look like . They ask if the country is getting " worse " in some general sense , without asking the respondents to imagine what " better " would look like .   The standard      question was asked , too , and 74 % said America the country " seriously off on the wrong track , a much higher level of pessimism than PRRI found in 2012 . The poll ’s internals put the question in the context of the current election by noting that 72 % of declared Donald Trump supporters thought American " society and way of life " have changed for the worse over the past 60 years , while a comparable percentage of Hillary Clinton ’s voters ( 70 % ) say they a comparable percentage of Hillary Clinton’s voters (70%) changed for the better .   Racial and class divisions were visible in the responses as well .    percent of black respondents and 57 % of Hispanics said things have gotten better since the Fifties , while 56 % of whites said the reverse . However , 56 % of    whites said better , while 65 % of " white    Americans " said worse . White evangelical Protestants reportedly had the most dour view of social evolution since the the Fifties with 74 % of them saying White evangelical Protestants has changed for the worse . Those who feel American culture and politics have taken a wrong turn expressed a strong sense of frustration and alienation in various other poll questions .    percent of poll respondents endorsed the notion of " a leader who is willing to break some rules , if that ’s what it takes to set things right , " with 55 % of declared Republicans supporting that idea .    percent    respondents said neither major party represents their views percent of respondents more , a    increase since 1990 . Clinton and Trump both have historically low approval ratings for presidential candidates , although Clinton fares Clinton on most attributes .    percent said big money has so much influence on elections that their vote Clinton and Trump both matters . Only 43 % of respondents expressed a great deal of confidence that their votes respondents be counted accurately . ( In an interesting side note to that last dismal statistic , respondents were evenly divided about whether illegal voters , or eligible voters unfairly denied the right to vote , were a more serious problem , but only 9 % thought " voter apathy " was the biggest problem with American elections . The media and political class thinks voter apathy is a much bigger problem than the actual electorate does . ) To be sure , the terms in many of these questions are highly subjective . " Since the 1950s , do you think American culture and way of life has mostly changed for the better , or has it mostly changed for the worse ? " is a very big question , especially given that many of the poll respondents were n’t around during the Fifties and Sixties .   Younger people on the Left side of the American political spectrum are generally given a negative view of the Fifties , especially with respect to racism and stodgy , judgmental " Ozzie and Harriet " culture , while the late Sixties are seen as a mystical transformative experience . Young people on the Right are more likely to hear about the virtues of those earlier times , or to be concerned about modern trends in divorce , illegitimacy , and    career anxiety . Both the good and bad things happened , of course , but a holistic view of a   ’s worth of culture will depend on emphasis . It seems likely that if most people on the Right the Right what " going back to the Fifties " would mean , they ’d talk most people on the Right restoring family and community values , strengthening the rule of law , and shoring up the economy for    people , but they would n’t most people on the Right to repeal the Civil Rights Act . On the other hand , ask the average campus liberal what going back to the Fifties means the Fifties " turning back the clock " on civil rights , or gay rights , will be a common , contemptuous response .   It ’s curious to think that our supposedly tolerant friends on the Left would take pleasure in the notion of white Christians feeling marginalized and frustrated , as such a poll suggests . Should n’t Utopia have a place for them , too ? our supposedly tolerant friends on the Left if they were a tiny our supposedly tolerant friends on the Left , should n’t their views be respected Even if they were a tiny minority a vibrant and healthy Republic ? (   question : how many generations do they have to be how many generations and powerless before they ’re no longer how many generations " oppressors " who can be discriminated against with abandon by our political system ? ) There will be a temptation for liberals to denounce this Republican affection for the Fifties as incoherent , dreamy nostalgia , but there are plenty of social indicators that are empirically worse today . We should be able to preserve what ’s good about the present without abandoning the wisdom of the past , on subjects where the " wrong track " can be mapped with hard , cold statistics . Another debatable assertion is that support for a leader " willing to break some rules , if that ’s what it takes to set things right " equals an embrace of " authoritarianism , " as PRRI puts it . For one thing , that ’s not the definition of authoritarianism . A nation can sink very far into authoritarian hell under leadership that does n’t actually break its own rules . A nation to the point , we ’re emerging from eight years under a leader , President Barack Obama , who most certainly does believe he should " break some rules , if that ’s what it takes to set things right . " It ’s the defining it of his presidency . He he come very he to using those exact words on many occasions , when pushing his notion of a he executive who should n’t have to put up with " gridlock " and " obstructionism , " no matter what the rules say , including the Constitution .   Some Republicans who responded positively to the idea of a leader who breaks the rules to do the rules right are merely asking for leadership that fights on Obama ’s terms , or accepting that Obama ’s actions have permanently Obama’s role of the President .   Conversely , very few Obama supporters would agree that Obama " breaking the rules Obama set things the rules makes him an authoritarian . If the Obama contest leads to a great national bipartisan conversation on the evils of authoritarianism , it will have a silver lining . the   contest all the responses from the PRRI poll together , and we might form a hypothesis that much of the " wrong track " feeling that grips American voters stems from their sense of helplessness , their anger American voters a    system that American voters n’t represent their interests , or grant them the American voters to make their own American voters .   People on American voters Left and Right have very different ideas about who the masters of that system are , and those differences make meaningful political cooperation difficult . We should have the wisdom to agree that claiming America has made no major mistakes since the Fifties is as absurd as claiming it has done nothing right .
