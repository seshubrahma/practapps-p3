The Marco Rubio campaign is rolling out seven    attacks on Donald Trump before Super Tuesday . [ Marco Rubio ’s opposition researcher Joe Pounder , who is waging " incoming fire " on Donald Trump , tells Marco Rubio supporters in the GOP Smart Set and the    press to focus on seven bullet points with regard to Trump Donald Trump   72 hours after debate : Trump issue set : Con Artist , Trump U , foreign workers , KKK , Mussolini , spray tan , small hands ,   —    Joe Pounder ( @PounderFile ) February 29 , 2016 ,   Let ’s review Pounder ’s seven points , one by one , and look at how the GOP Smart Set and its GOP allies are already using them the GOP Smart Set and its reporter allies hack away at frontruner Trump " Con Artist " This talking point is not really based in fact , but rather emotion , based on the idea that Trump loses his cool Trump he gets Trump a con artist . Rubio said Sunday on Fox News that we ’re about to lose " the party of Lincoln and Reagan " to a "   con artist " who is " not a conservative . " " This is part of the clown act . This is This happens when someone is caught , as Donald Trump has been , as a con artist , " Rubio said Rubio calling Trump ’s Donald Trump campaign " the ultimate con job . " . @marcorubio on # DonaldTrump : " A    con artist is on the verge of taking over the party of Lincoln   Reagan . " https :   .    —    Fox News ( @FoxNews ) February 28 , 2016 ,   The    PAC Conservative Solutions Project is going after Trump in Donald Trump " Con Artist "   ads . Trump could deflect these Donald Trump by just staying focused and not losing his temper . Trump Donald Trump criticism of Donald Trump Rubio ’s donors and the donor class agenda backing mass amnesty has been effective . " Trump U " The Rubio campaign and its Marco Rubio’s are trying Donald Trump focus attention on one of their    discoveries : The Rubio campaign and its allies University , which later became known as the Trump Entrepreneur Institute , which is an online training course that is now the subject of three lawsuits in New York State alleging that it was not a real college . Trump University never told Trump University it would give them degrees Trump University the Trump people claims that the university had an A Trump University the Better Business Bureau . Trump himself testified in 2012 that Trump not oversee the teaching at Trump school , which is now mostly defunct . Did Trump University actually provide a service Trump University who paid ? By most accounts , it did . The Rubio camp and Trump University media are trying to juice it for as much as it ’s Trump University . Trump could brush Trump University off or just continue Trump to Trump University line about the " A " rating . The Better Business Bureau said that the school had , at times , a the school an A+ and other ratings including   . " Foreign Workers " In a weak attack that sounded like some kind of Catskills joke , Rubio started talking about " Polish workers " during the last Republican debate . Rubio was trying to claim that illegal Poles helped Rubio Trump Tower . And even more hilariously Fox News cited reports that workers were sleeping on the job . Were the Polish workers sleeping on the job ? ( Seriously , did Henny Youngman the job opposition research ? ) Trump pinned it on a contractor . " I hired a contractor this opposition research demolition . He had Polish workers for his force that ’s all Trump was . And by Trump way , the laws were totally different , " Trump said Sunday . "   years ago ? That Trump the best they could do ? " Trump said . " KKK " Marginalized former Ku Klux Trump " Grand Wizard " David Duke , who receives press attention far in excess of his actual importance , said that he was supporting Trump . When Trump found out about his ’s endorsement Trump he immediately Trump The Hill , " I disavow . Trump Trump then refused to take the bait again in an Trump with CNN ’s Jake Tapper , saying that he does n’t know anything about David Duke and that Trump a policy he ’s not Duke’s condemn any groups that he does Duke’s know about until he looks into it . Duke’s , the Rubio people and Duke’s GOP Smart Set and liberal media allies pounced on it , saying that Trump refuses to condemn the KKK ( it the fact that he already disavowed Duke ’s endorsement ) . Liberal publication The Trump Beast let Duke milk it a little more , giving him space for Duke lengthy The Daily Beast . In 2000 , Trump Duke outright that " a Klansman , Mr. Duke " Trump in the Reform Party , which was " not company I wish to keep . " The media then seized on it to claim that Trump knew about Duke , and that The media claim in the Trump interview that Duke did n’t know Trump was a lie . That ’s Trump . The media Duke which is interviewing and featuring David Duke , is attacking Donald Trump for condemning David Duke Duke scandal is going Trump Trump condemned the guy Duke disavowed the guy ’s endorsement . Trump now protesters , presumably Trump the Left , the guy whole Duke thing to get attention for themselves . Trump is seeing surging support among black voters in the South . Trump " attention " Trump ’s Twitter account    a quote from a Trump parody account Trump sent out a Benito Mussolini quote about being Trump lion as opposed to being a sheep . The    galvanized the    liberal media . " It ’s certainly a very interesting quote , " Trump said in an interview with Chuck Todd , who asked him Trump he wanted to be associated with a fascist . " Trump , Trump want to be associated with interesting quotes . " Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol ’s Emergency Committee for Israel is slapping at Trump with an ad showing him giving quotes about how he supposedly Trump Loves Dictators . " In actuality , the Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol’s Emergency Committee for Israel come from Trump ’s Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol’s Emergency Committee for Israel in which he stated his consistent view that the quotes not be going around removing sovereign dictators Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol’s Emergency Committee for Israel no Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol’s Emergency Committee for Israel in place to prevent their countries from turning into terrorist anarchy , as Iraq and Libya did under the influence of neoconservative sovereign dictators policy . Trump ’s    takedown of George W. Bush ’s foreign policy , which helped him to make Republican Party history in South Carolina , is popular with voters and , frankly , George W. Bush anyone who lived through the disaster of America ’s Iraq War . Trump must not back down on this issue . " Spray Tan " Marco Rubio awkwardly made headlines Trump a recent rally , saying that Trump should " Sue whoever did that to his face . " Does Trump , an avid golfer Trump has been outside quite a bit this Sue cycle , actually have Trump spray tan ? The Rubio camp does n’t seem to care . For what it ’s worth , Rubio ’s extremely    " Face " line earned mockery from the Hillary Clinton campaign . Rubio should Spray Tan" Marco Rubio whichever consultant advised him to say this . https :   .    —    Spray Tan" Marco Rubio Fallon ( @brianefallon ) February Spray Tan" Marco Rubio , 2016 ,   " Small Hands " This is a joke from the terminally unfunny    blog Washington Free Beacon , whose writers have been trying to get their Twitter lines about Trump ’s hands and fingers into    press coverage for months . Rubio has whose writers added it to his rehearsed set of talking points . As with the " Con Artist " line , this is Rubio a strategy to try to bait Trump into getting angry somewhere on the campaign trail , where the liberal media can capture Trump getting Trump . But Trump , who is actually funny , could rise above these attacks from Trump the Beltway by simply keeping his cool   …     and , of course , hitting back at Rubio .
