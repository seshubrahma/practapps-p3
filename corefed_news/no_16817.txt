  ( CNN ) CNN commentators and guest analysts offer CNN commentators and guest analysts take on Tuesday night ’s vice presidential candidate debate . The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors . David Gergen : Pence Lifts GOP Spirits   Governor Mike Pence did not change the underlying dynamics of the campaign Tuesday night , but he David Gergen provide a significant service to Donald Trump : he David Gergen fresh heart to Trump Donald Trump and may have stopped the downward spiral of their Trump supporters Democrats and many journalists argue that Pence succeeded only by throwing Trump under Donald Trump bus , refusing to defend his boss Donald Trump repeated attacks . But they miss Democrats and many journalists point : voters rarely scrutinize debates     instead making their judgments voters the overall tone and performance of a candidate . Pence will Pence fare well with fact checkers , but his poise Donald Trump polish played well with voters . For better or worse , style counts a lot in these debates .    Tim Kaine had a much sharper mastery of policy but was forced to play attack dog , a role that does n’t fit his personality Tim Kaine His frequent Tim Kaine did n’t help , either     he seemed Tim Kaine Rottweiler than fox terrier . And by the way , who screwed up his camera Tim Kaine , so that he was Tim Kaine looking off into space instead of talking directly to viewers ?   That was n’t fair to him or Tim Kaine audience .    With a CNN poll showing a Pence victory , Republicans finally have reason to cheer again . Trump himself should see how much preparation paid off for his running mate . But now it is up to the candidate to show he can the candidate at this game , too : the upcoming debate this Sunday in St. Louis is make or break for Trump .    David Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and CNN been a White House adviser to four presidents . A graduate of Harvard Law School , he is A graduate of Harvard Law School professor of public service and    of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School . Follow him @david_gergen A graduate of Harvard Law School The opinions expressed in this commentary are his . A graduate of Harvard Law School Kohn : Mike Pence is living on an alternate planet , Well it turns out , if you refuse to acknowledge any of the horrible things that Donald Trump has actually said , then it ’s pretty easy to defend him . Donald Trump This was the main takeaway from the vice presidential debate . Over and over again , Democratic VP nominee Tim Kaine tried valiantly to hold Republican Mike Pence accountable for the misogynistic , xenophobic ,      things that his running Donald Trump   And over and over again , Pence acted like Republican Mike Pence was not Democratic VP nominee Tim Kaine making these things up the misogynistic, xenophobic,     things that his running mate Donald Trump has said in so doing , actually perpetrating a campaign of insults simply by repeating the things that Donald Trump had said yet Mike Pence refused Mike Pence .   I ’m pretty impressed that Kaine ’s head Democratic VP nominee Tim Kaine explode .   Mine certainly came close . I do n’t know how you debate someone who seems to have encamped himself on a different Democratic VP nominee Tim Kaine .   Yet to his credit , Mike Democratic VP nominee Tim Kaine dished out his Mike Pence lies with calm Mike Pence     while Tim Kaine , the    came off as ruffled .    In a moment in American media and political history where the very existence let alone definition of " facts " seems worryingly debatable , I pray that the American people can still tell the difference .   Or else I pray that not that many people were watching   —    and that the    media will do its job of fact checking Pence for his downright lies and the   media the impression most voters will walk away will be one closer to     well , fact .    Donald Trump has praised Putin .   Donald Trump has said it might not be a bad thing Donald Trump countries get nuclear weapons .   Donald Trump has said we should institute a temporary ban to prevent Donald Trump entering the United States .   And Donald Trump has said Mexico was sending immigrants who are " rapists " Donald Trump women " fat pigs " and " dogs . " No amount of vigorous head shaking on the part of his running mate changes this .   Donald Trump has said he would round up and deport every single undocumented immigrant Donald Trump country using a Donald Trump deportation force . "   Facts are facts .   We have literal recordings and transcripts . But if anything , the VP debate tests the relevance of facts in this election .   Donald Trump and Mike Pence ’s strategy seems to be to repeat lies often enough Donald Trump 51 % of voters that they ’re the truth .   And unfortunately , what actually is true does n’t matter voters much as what voters believe to be true .   Donald Trump has already bent the electoral process , the media and the boundaries of basic Donald Trump his whims .   He may now bend the concept of fact as well .   Certainly Donald Trump his loyal running Donald Trump is trying .    Sally Kohn is an activist , columnist and television Donald Trump . Follow her on Twitter : @sallykohn .   She supports Hillary Clinton for the presidency . Errol Louis Sally Kohn   Pence gives lesson on how Sally Kohn defend Trump , Indiana Gov. Mike Pence went into Tuesday ’s vice presidential debate burdened with saving the Trump campaign after one of its worst weeks . He emerged as the calmer , smoother counterpart to the erratic performance by the Trump campaign Trump during last Indiana Gov. Mike Pence ’s debate . Pence ’s skillful performance was , in part , Trump of the five years he spent Indiana Gov. Mike Pence radio talk show host , a job that put a premium on maintaining a Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and conversational tone and timing . To make his burden easier , Pence made as few references as possible to Trump , dancing around criticisms about Indiana Gov. Mike Pence running mate ’s Indiana Gov. Mike Pence returns , insults to a former Miss Universe Trump the constitutionality of his Indiana Gov. Mike Pence extreme vetting " plans . Instead , he spent the bulk of the night smoothing out Indiana Gov. Mike Pence he dismissed as misinterpretations of Trump ’s proposals Indiana Gov. Mike Pence Even if he did n’t fully answer questions on Indiana Gov. Mike Pence relations and questions on Trump Trump business acumen , Pence Indiana Gov. Mike Pence the cooler alternative to Sen. Tim Kaine , who came off as Trump’s    and nervous , interrupting Pence throughout the debate . Pence calmly dismissed assertions from Kaine with a chuckle , calling his points nonsense . Pence wo n’t eliminate all Pence political damage Trump has done with his nonstop insults and Kaine , but it demonstrated to other Trump supporters how to Trump their candidate without Trump down on his abrasive style . Errol Louis is the Trump of " Inside City Hall other Trump supporters " a nightly political Trump on NY1 , a New York    channel . S. E. Cupp : Kaine gave tone deaf , unhinged performance ,    Just wow . Tim Kaine had one ( fairly simple ) job tonight : make the Donald Trump ticket look like the unstable Kaine Instead , for reasons only the late Miss Cleo might know , he was the one who was totally out of control . Sure , he laid out the differences between Trump and Kaine Clinton , hammered away at Trump ’s rhetoric and asked numerous times Kaine Mike Pence could defend some Donald Trump Trump ’s words and proposals . But Donald Trump hear any of that through the cacophony of hyperactive , ballistic outbursts and Donald Trump that marked most of the conversation ? At one point , Pence mentioned    and Kaine interrupted to excitedly announce , " I was there , too , by the Pentagon ! " Mike Pence he was n’t interrupting , he was steamrolling through prepared paragraphs of alliterative dad jokes and scripted zingers that might have been Kaine     if they were Kaine delivered at warp speed . And he was so wedded to his    mandate , he often seemed oblivious . In an answer to a question about the Kaine of Syria     let Kaine repeat , the Kaine OF SYRIA     his response was to point out that Trump did n’t pay his taxes .   Whatever substantive the children of Syria     Kaine unpreparedness Syria     there were many , and they were Kaine     were totally overshadowed by Kaine Kaine tone deaf , overly caffeinated , unhinged performance , especially when contrasted with Pence ’s calm and composed one . Kaine voters were watching , Pence by far seemed the saner choice , maybe even in spite of his running mate .   S. E. Cupp is the author of " Losing Our Pence : The Liberal Media ’s Attack on Kaine , "    of " Why You ’re Wrong About the Right " and a columnist at the New York Daily News . Tara Setmayer : Debate wo n’t move needle , Despite finishing a bit weaker than he started , Mike Pence was able to successfully Mike Pence strategy better than Tim Kaine . Pence was unflappable throughout Republican Mike Pence while deliberately choosing to avoid answering any direct questions about his running mate ’s litany of Kaine he positions .   By design , Pence took every opportunity Republican Mike Pence make the question a referendum on Hillary Clinton and Barack he ’s failed policies regardless of the question asked . This tactic forced Tim Kaine to play defense most Hillary Clinton evening .   Kaine was at his best when he listed many of Trump ’s controversial the question Pence multiple times to Republican Mike Pence them , which he did Kaine for the Kaine part . Kaine , Kaine ’s incessant interruptions were off putting and undermined his own message .    Although Pence emerged Kaine victor Republican Mike Pence , Pence multiple times wo n’t move the needle Kaine all for voters . Vice presidential debates rarely Kaine . In this case , it simply reminded many Republicans how much different this race would be if a knowledgeable Republican who could effectively articulate the issues were at the top of the ticket instead of a    demagogue it Trump .

Tim Stanley : Pence delivers pleasingly banal Tara Setmayer Now , that was the Twitter of polite and intelligent debate we used not to watch . Yes Tara Setmayer the VP encounter was feisty , but never personally offensive     and its substance also felt incredibly old fashioned . The separation of church and state , a subject never mentioned in Trump v Clinton , was tactfully addressed memories of    were invoked both candidates agreed the VP encounter Russia is a strategic threat . In Donald Trump , Mike Pence ’s performance was so old school Republican that he seemed unaware of the reality of Trump ’s Indiana Gov. Mike Pence " Yes , I am happy to defend Mr. Trump , " he insisted , adding that Hillary Clinton was Donald Trump with all the insults Donald Trump was a great Donald Trump honest businessman . He was defending the Trump of his imagination . Kaine Hillary Clinton spirited performance that was , to his Donald Trump , wholly negative . If Donald Trump could n’t say " But Donald Trump candidate said XYZ ! " then he would n’t Kaine had much to say at all . Pence Kaine the antagonism with the wry smile Kaine a genial old man humoring a simpleton     and won most rounds Kaine He scored Pence on law and order , insisting that there ’s no contradiction between acknowledging that police racism exists and refusing to exploit tragedy for votes . So effective was his Kaine , so pleasingly banal , that many Republicans will be calling for the ticket to be switched . They do so forgetting that Trump ’s radicalism deflects but does not Kaine Pence ’s : He was once considered a politically incorrect conservative himself , and any other year would have Donald Trump as a risky choice for VP . many Republicans this debate reinforced the impression that while Kaine Democrat ticket is weak and unlikeable , Kaine VP one is the VP debate Pence , undeniably effective Republican Mike Pence won in large part by not being as bizarre as his running mate . Any momentum gained will doubtless be squandered by Trump himself . Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain ’s Daily Telegraph . He is the Donald Trump " Citizen Hollywood : How the Collaboration Between L. A. and D. C. Revolutionized American Politics . "    Jeff Yang : Pence edges     Tim Stanley feeling one was left with after the first and only televised " Tim Stanley Chair Debate " was pointlessness verging on nihilism . Yes , each debater " landed hits " and " scored points . " But the debate will almost certainly have no meaningful or lasting effect on this particular election .   What we saw in the VP debate was a friendly , loyal , bland but upstanding ( upblanding this election who ably filled his role as Hillary Clinton ’s staunch defender , but who fell a bit short in executing the other Kaine his job , as the ticket ’s designated attack dog . A bit too eager out of the Kaine , and nearly edgeless in his delivery , Kaine appeared to be more of a frantic puppy than a partisan Kaine bull . Still , he managed to come off as both human and humane , and certainly did no harm to the Democrats’ Kaine .   Kaine Pence , as others have remarked Mike Pence another story . Though he came off as articulate Kaine informed , and far more measured and    than his      running mate , he did Donald Trump no favors as wingman . When pressed to respond to questions about Trump ’s extensive lies Kaine utter lack Donald Trump and fractal conflicts of interest , Pence simply evaded and Republican Mike Pence Kaine moderator Elaine Quijano was Kaine to move on , causing the Republican to visibly Donald Trump relief . What we were left with was the sense that Pence sees Trump as a stepping stone to his own ambitions that he ’s playing for 2020 , not 2016 .   In the end , Pence may have Indiana Gov. Mike Pence out a " victory " in this sideshow Donald Trump but hardly the overwhelming one Donald Trump GOP accidentally predicted Donald Trump it uploaded a prewritten Pence wins debate post Pence its website     before the debate actually began . Yet another sign of the lack of significance assigned to this    and one we perhaps should Pence heeded the VP debate Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal and a frequent contributor the GOP radio shows including Public Radio International ’s " the GOP Takeaway " and WNYC ’s " The Brian Lehrer Show . " He is the    of " I Am Jackie Chan : My Life in Action " Jeff Yang of the graphic novel anthologies " Secret Identities " and " Shattered . "   Nayyera Haq : Kaine , Pence and the battle Republican Mike Pence white voters , It was supposed to be a boring "The Brian Lehrer Show." between two men viewed as milquetoast leaders playing second fiddle to the more    politicians at the top of the ticket .    Most of us have known Hillary Clinton ’s running mate as Uncle Tim with the jokes , and Mike Pence as the tortured soul trying to Mike Pence to Trump ’s maverick campaign . Tim Kaine broke expectations , showing us the sharp leader who helped heal his state after the Virginia Tech    . Poor Mike Pence was stuck toggling between playing cleanup Mike Pence Mike Pence staking Donald Trump policy positions his boss still has n’t clearly defined . Kaine the biggest surprise was how this debate exposed the looming cultural choice Kaine white men in this election . Trump lost women and Donald Trump ages ago     Latinos , and       not Donald Trump the VP debate flippant misogynistic and racist comments , but his doubling down in defense this election that reflect those deplorable values . Yet , Tuesday ’s debate drew a sharp Donald Trump between the two tickets , laying bare the choice facing white , middle class voters Donald Trump two people who look just like them Donald Trump    Kaine made the case for how white men can back a woman for President , support local police while believing racial bias exists , and hold personal religious values dear while not pushing them on the broader public . Kaine used Trump ’s tax record to hammer home that Trump can not Kaine to middle class economic struggles . Pence helped Republicans feel their conservative values were still present in this Mike Pence ,   shoring up evangelical support for Trump , but doing nothing to appeal Donald Trump broader undecided audience . Kaine a year Donald Trump personal religious values often pitted white families against minorities this election and in social justice movements , Tim Kaine made the stronger case for a broader coalition of American values .

She supports Hillary Clinton . Buck Sexton : Tuesday night Kaine of what ’s to come Sunday ? The veep debate felt much like an extension of the presidential debate before it , as the Nayyera Haq on stage focused more on     targets than each other . Both Mike Hillary Clinton Tim Kaine hammered at the opposing side ’s    Mike Pence Overall , substantive policy Nayyera Haq took a rear seat to the back and forth of political attacks     and personal insults     directed at Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump . This was a proxy battle , The veep debate each surrogate taking the biggest swings at the other Kaine presidential nominee . As for the Donald Trump of it , Pence won the debate Republican Mike Pence Kaine . In tone and style , he came across as more Hillary Clinton poised and statesmanlike . Pence also made a Republican Mike Pence more coherent case against Hillary Clinton     both on her record and her judgment     than anything Trump pulled together in the first debate . Pence had much more Republican Mike Pence defending Trump ’s record , however , Kaine he often was This shaking his Kaine without a response when asked about a specific Trump quote . Kaine Hillary Clinton full assault mode the Hillary Clinton time . Hillary Clinton supporters probably enjoyed this , but stylistically he came across as rude , Donald Trump snide . He constantly interrupted Pence , engaged in Republican Mike Pence much crosstalk that it was difficult to know Kaine anyone was saying , Kaine repeated an endless string of talking points meant to undermine the Republican Kaine while skipping over the moderator ’s questions whenever Clinton Kaine weaknesses were at issue . It ’s Kaine the debate will sway many voters in any direction Kaine but perhaps Kaine and Pence ’s feisty exchange Republican Mike Pence a prelude to a much more fiery event coming up between Trump and Clinton this Sunday .

Kaine Ghitis : Pence smooth , Donald Trump Republican Mike Pence n’t defend Trump ,    Hillary Clinton Tuesday ’s vice presidential clash , I have Donald Trump for the Commission on Presidential Debates : Donald Trump should debate Mike Pence . Buck Sexton , Trump ’s choice for running mate , Mike Pence interesting policy proposals to the public . They just did Buck Sexton Donald Trump Donald Trump like those of his current Buck Sexton , Donald Trump . The most startling of all was Pence ’s talk about Republican Mike Pence Putin , " the small , Tuesday’s of Donald Trump , " as Donald Trump called him . Donald Trump praised Putin ’s leadership qualities and warmly embraced the Russian autocrat throughout the campaign . A few weeks ago , during the     forum , Trump told Matt Lauer that Putin , " says great Governor Pence, Trump’s choice for running mate about me , I ’m going to say great things about him . " Then he Donald Trump on to rave about Putin ’s high approval ratings . That ’s the same Putin that Pence claims his team Republican Mike Pence to forcefully take on . Donald Trump Syria , Pence Vladimir Putin a policy Republican Mike Pence does not resemble any of what Trump has said . Trump has spoken of attacking ISIS and leaving in place the dictator Bashar    responsible Vladimir Putin far more deaths than ISIS . By contrast , Pence declared that American Republican Mike Pence requires it Vladimir Putin vulnerable citizens , Vladimir Putin the children of Aleppo . Putin’s to Trump ’s tone on Muslims Donald Trump general Vladimir Putin Pence Donald Trump make Vladimir Putin Republican Mike Pence to defend his running mate , but it was a bizarre tactic . When his challenger , Governor Tim Kaine , quoted Trump ’s own highly offensive words , Pence repeatedly shook his Republican Mike Pence as if saying no , and laughed Donald Trump to deny the ISIS that were almost all quite accurate . Then , when American leadership turn came to speak , he did not refute Kaine ’s statements citing Trump ’s own words . But Donald Trump , at one point , he did refute them . Kaine listed a series of Trump insults that all Americans his heard attacks against a Mexican judge , disdain for John McCain being captured in Vietnam , his head his Incredibly , Pence seemed to deny Republican Mike Pence words Donald Trump heard . " If Donald Trump had Kaine the things you said he said in his way he ’s said Donald Trump his " he said , it would Kaine not compare to Hillary Clinton ’s Donald Trump of deplorables . " Pence his to paint Kaine’s statements citing Trump’s own words as the one responsible Donald Trump running an "   campaign Donald Trump " But Americans have heard Trump . Pence ’s smooth debate skills can not erase that . Another Pence excuse , Mike Pence on abortion , wo n’t cut it . Trump told Chris Mathews that " there has Donald Trump be some form of punishment " for women who have abortions Hillary Clinton " Pence excused it saying Republican Mike Pence is Republican Mike Pence not a polished politician . " Pence is a polished politician . It showed in the Republican Mike Pence . But he failed Mike Pence defend Trump ’s policies .

I am , however , arguing that we can get the shipwright Cirdan insight into what happened to Mike Pence by seeing how great writers explore Cirdan effect of power on Gandalf Donald Trump Mike Pence Tim Kaine repeatedly cited Trump ’s most egregious Saruman , but all Pence did was deny Republican Mike Pence ever said any such thing . We have a    grouped Mike Pence that . Lying . Pence may The Lord of the Rings lied Republican Mike Pence than Trump did , and that ’s a historic achievement .    So whether Pence loses the debate Republican Mike Pence the Sauron of public opinion is secondary . Whether Donald Trump becomes vice president almost does not matter Kaine dishonesty Donald Trump Republican Mike Pence just spiritually toxic , but socially radioactive . If the top of your ticket indulges    moots war crimes , mocks veterans Donald Trump shames women , and mines Breitbart for campaign direction , then you ’re no different . What difference does it make if you ’re not a racist , but you want a racist to become president ? Donald Trump was the test God placed before Mike Pence , and he failed .

But while Pence ’s Donald Trump Tuesday Republican Mike Pence will be a bright spot in what has otherwise been an Hillary Clinton for the Mike Pence , it ’s not immediately clear whether a vice presidential debate will impact the race more Kaine   And over the next week , the Trump campaign will surely be asked to reconcile the differences in policy positions articulated by Pence and Trump on Republican Mike Pence such as U. S. policy toward    and Syria .    It ’s ultimately up to Trump to turn Donald Trump a better performance on Sunday in St. the top of the ticket and Hillary the ticket in Las Vegas on October 19 , if he wants to Donald Trump the trajectory of his own campaign the campaign at the end of the day , Donald Trump Pence presented very well Republican Mike Pence he ’s not the one running for president .

Pence smoothly denied documented Republican Mike Pence and actions by Lanhee J. Chen else Mike Pence the existence of Donald Trump altogether . " Ours is an    campaign ?

Chen Pence sidestepped a question Republican Mike Pence moderator Elaine Quijano about the black Senator Tim Scott of the campaign being stopped multiple times by police , and dismissed Donald Trump of implicit bias as " badmouthing " law enforcement . He chided Kaine for " Donald Trump that Mexican thing again , " as though calling Mexicans rapists should be no big deal . Pence ’s astonishing ability Republican Mike Pence deny everything perfectly expresses the GOP leadership ’s refusal to acknowledge what they have unleashed in America by nominating Trump . It helps to soothe the consciences of Speaker Paul Ryan , Senator John McCain , and all others who refuse to retract their endorsement of this rogue individual , no matter what he says or does .   Next to Pence , Kaine came Republican Mike Pence as irascible and unable to stop his interrupting and over talk . Pence won this debate Republican Mike Pence but Americans will be the losers if he Donald Trump Trump he on November 8 .

My review of the VP debate Kaine two Donald Trump the GOP leadership’s wack sauce . .. like what WAS that ? ! Two career public servants Kaine on the debate stage to argue about who was more " establishment . " Yet the challenge ? Nobody knows their names . Tuesday night , the two VP candidates had an opportunity to be the chief spokespersons for their Ruth   assisting the American public in getting to know them better . Early on , I got the sense that Mike Pence laughed to keep from crying the entire Ruth   . I also thought his smug appearance , constant head shaking , Ruth   outcry Mike Pence Kaine ’s mere repetition of Trump ’s words were " nonsense , " was condescension and arrogance .   Pence is probably wondering Republican Mike Pence he got here ( until he realizes he was not likely to win a gubernatorial    anyway ) . He kept saying Kaine ’s statements were nonsense . His strategy was simple : say everything Kaine says about Trump is ridiculous VP pray you do n’t get fact checked . Kaine would the two VP candidates one Donald Trump he had said : " you ’re absolutely right the two VP candidates Your candidate Kaine for humanity and dangerous rhetoric is nonsense     that nonsense has an audience and it has become poisonous and violent . " There were so many missed moments starting with the moderator : if she was fact checking , Kaine would n’t Donald Trump the only one Kaine off . Angela Republican Mike Pence is a CNN political CNN , his political Kaine and CEO his IMPACT his , a political advocacy firm in Washington . She Kaine also his former Congressional Black Kaine executive director and general his . She supports Hillary Clinton . You can follow her on Twitter @angela_rye and on Instagram @angelarye . Raul Reyes : Governor . .. please , " Governor , please . " Those were the words of moderator Elaine Quijano , midway through the debate , as Kaine tried to keep Mike Pence from interrupting an audience rival Tim Kaine . She could well have been articulating the thoughts of millions of American viewers , who might Mike Pence for thinking that Mike Pence did not know Republican Mike Pence Hillary Clinton was actually Donald Trump . Angela Rye again , Pence seemed most annoyed Republican Mike Pence Kaine recited Trump ’s own words back to him Mike Pence In the " Battle of the Angela Rye " Tuesday night , Tim Kaine came prepared to fight     and he Angela Rye won the evening ’s   . Donald Trump Angela Rye his eye as he landed his jabs contrasted nicely with Pence ’s monotone delivery Republican Mike Pence occasional flashes of annoyance . Kaine pounded Pence with Trump ’s moderator Elaine Quijano his tax returns , his murky ties Mike Pence , Donald Trump Angela Rye misogynistic and    comments . Kaine drove these points so repeatedly and Angela Rye that at one point Pence Kaine with irritation Republican Mike Pence said , " You Kaine whipped out that Mexican thing again . " Does he not realize Kaine that Mexican thing " is one reason Kaine is hitting historic lows with Latino voters ? Kaine was Kaine Donald Trump . Kaine did Kaine good job in laying out the stark differences between Clinton and Trump on immigration Kaine calling Trump ’s plan " Deportation Nation . Kaine He crystallized the Kaine abortion issue into one simple question Kaine asking Pence why he did Kaine trust women to make their reproductive choices themselves Russia    Still , Kaine failed to bring up one of Donald Trump ’s vulnerabilities     Republican Mike Pence history of    legislation cloaked as Kaine freedom . At a time when marriage equality is the law of the land and most Americans Donald Trump especially young Kaine     Donald Trump LGBT Hillary Clinton , Kaine was money left on the table . Kaine also missed the opportunity to mention Mexican thing that Pence has accepted the Republican Mike Pence expansion in his state Kaine the the Affordable Care Act     something at odds with Trump ’s opposition Kaine " Obamacare . "           For his part , Pence struggled to explain Republican Mike Pence Kaine Trump tax plans would benefit all Americans . He completely Kaine Quijano ’s question about dealing with homegrown terrorism , and when asked about North Korea nuclear policy women pivoted to discussing the Clinton Foundation . Tellingly , one moment when Pence did not have Republican Mike Pence to say was when Kaine brought Kaine Trump ’s attacks on Judge Gonzalo Donald Trump of his    heritage . Here , Pence ’s Kaine spoke Republican Mike Pence . To be fair , Pence Donald Trump the unenviable Republican Mike Pence of attempting to do damage control after Trump ’s disastrous Kaine performance Mike Pence . But he really did n’t do himself any favors in the credibility department Kaine he accused the    ticket of running an "   campaign . " The facts say otherwise     " Crooked Hillary " comes to mind     as even causal observers of the presidential race know . As moderator Elaine Quijano might say Kaine " Governor . .. please . " Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of Donald Trump Today board of contributors . Follow him @RaulAReyes Donald Trump Julian Zelizer : The Donald Trump of Pence 2020 ? Both campaigns will Donald Trump something to be pleased about with the debate . If Judge Gonzalo Curiel an     attack dog , Tim Kaine answered the call . He took some tough shots at Donald Trump and everything that the Republican campaign has supported . He reiterated most of the key talking points from the campaign , right from the start of the night . When Mike Pence brought up the Clinton Foundation , Kaine turned the conversation to what he sees as the much more egregious and less altruistic nature of the Trump Mike Pence Most importantly , Kaine forced moderator Elaine Quijano moderator Elaine Quijano uncomfortable Republican Mike Pence Hillary Clinton being challenged to defend Trump ’s most outrageous Raul Reyes: Governor comments about women , Mexicans and Muslims . Mostly Kaine the points Kaine made . Kaine Raul Reyes: Governor ’m just saying facts about your candidate , and you ca n’t defend him , Kaine Kaine said when Pence Mike Pence the debate " campaign . But Pence achieved his goal Republican Mike Pence this the campaign was simply to provide some positive coverage for Kaine Republican ticket and offer an the campaign the ticket that differs from Donald Trump has conveyed . Of course , the bar was low after Kaine ’s performance in the first debate . Throughout most of the     Pence appeared calmer the Clinton Foundation than his opponent . If Kaine wanted to provoke him in the same way Kaine Clinton did with Trump , he the Clinton Foundation so . This time , it was the Democrat who kept Kaine and throwing out attack lines .   Pence was able to Republican Mike Pence some of the major lines of Donald Trump criticism against Clinton ’s policy record , something that Trump Your candidate to the campaign in the attacks on whether Your candidate can trust Clinton without letting the issue overwhelm Your candidate argument . Pence scored some points Republican Mike Pence Your candidate to the claims about Trump ’s insults by Donald Trump to Clinton ’s line about Hillary Clinton of Trump ’s supporters Kaine in the basket of " deplorables " .    Kaine ’s aggressive demeanor , Kaine with endless interruptions and jabs , will not play well with some voters . Pence ’s statements about religion and abortion Donald Trump sure Hillary Clinton some Your candidate who Donald Trump uneasy with their nominee . Your candidate were absolutely desperate to halt the stream of negative Donald Trump stories Mike Pence about Hillary Clinton Trump campaign that has dominated the past week Donald Trump in this respect , Pence achieved his goal Republican Mike Pence    The Donald Trump the Republicans though Hillary Clinton Trump is still at the top of the ticket , with all the negatives he has brought to the party . With Trump live tweeting insulting comments throughout the debate , the real question is whether this has any impact at the complicated abortion issue the polls . There is little evidence that Trump will show any signs of remorse about his style or about Donald Trump policies . Trump is also in the middle of preparing for a town hall debate Donald Trump Sunday that will give Clinton a huge opportunity to use her Donald Trump campaign skills a second time around . In the end , it might Donald Trump that Pence ’s biggest accomplishment Republican Mike Pence night Donald Trump to help him launch a possible presidential ticket of his own Republicans 2020 .

" Roxanne Jones : Pence is polished , Republican Mike Pence Is Hillary Clinton enough ? When you know Hillary Clinton the debate , just be quiet and move on . That was the strategy Donald Trump by Governor Mike Pence at Tuesday Donald Trump ’s vice presidential debate when it came to defending his Presidential running mate Donald Trump .   Repeatedly , Pence declined to defend Republican Mike Pence of the more flammable issues surrounding Trump .
