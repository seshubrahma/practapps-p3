Washington ( CNN ) Russian hackers breached accounts of GOP individuals and organizations prior to the election     including GOP House members , thought leaders and    tied to the Republican party     a former senior law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN Monday . Since most of the GOP material was not released , whereas the emails of Democratic Party groups and officials were made public , the intelligence community has growing confidence that hacking of US entities was meant to steer the US election toward Trump . In addition , there is evidence that entities connected to the Russian government were bankrolling " troll farms " that spread fake news about Clinton , according to the former official . Investigators also found digital footprints of individuals tied to the Russian government who had been on intelligence agencies’ radar before , as was acknowledged when the intelligence agency put out a public statement in October . All of these findings provide a greater understanding of what the intelligence community relied on to assess Russia ’s intentions . Even before the election , the US intelligence community was " close " to assessing that Russia intention was to aid Trump , rather than simply to disrupt the election process , the former senior law enforcement official said . However , there was disagreement     particularly between the intelligence agencies and the FBI     as to how certain this assessment was , multiple officials told CNN . The the former senior law enforcement official clear Monday that assessing the intentions of a foreign power is imprecise by its nature . Moreover , a a foreign power US official explained that the FBI is very conservative in the FBI     and typically does n’t give the FBI     definitive assessment if a conclusion ca n’t be proven without a doubt . The CIA constantly has to make judgments based on an incomplete picture .   However , " Everyone agrees that a foreign power , i. e. Russia , engaged in criminal activity inside the United States , " the former official said .
