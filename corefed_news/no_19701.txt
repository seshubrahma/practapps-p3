In many ways , 2016 has been the strongest year , economically , since the    or even the late 1990s . Unemployment was low . Wages were increasing . The markets hit new highs . Consumer confidence rose . Yet Donald Trump unseated the incumbent party and won the presidential election promoting economic pessimism and promising restoration : Donald Trump swore to Make America Great Again , describing America as falling behind , workers as jilted , growth as anemic , and the current period of expansion as a sham . How could a message like Donald Trump ’s take hold in an economy like that ? The answer is that it did not take hold with everyone —   or , more to the point , everywhere . In ways that have been overlooked and    for years , the strength of the    recovery has varied dramatically not just from income bracket to income bracket , but from place to place as well . And it so happens that the places left behind are also places that wield outsized political power —   enough power to vault the loser of the popular vote to the presidency and to make the economic story of 2016 more about stagnation , failure , and the dissolution of the American dream than it was about the headline economic numbers . And those headline numbers were undeniably good . This year offered unremarkable but steady growth —   about 2 percent , the      annual pace that has characterized the Obama recovery . But over time , that      annual pace has nudged the economy to a pretty good position relative to where it the economy eight years ago . The unemployment rate has fallen to 4 . 6 percent , its The unemployment rate level in nine years and " in the vicinity of maximum employment , " according to Janet Yellen , the chair of the Federal Reserve . Businesses added about 2 million jobs , and measures of underemployment dropped as well . " It ’s a pretty good year bordering on a very good year in terms of jobs , " Mark Zandi , the chief economist at Moody ’s Analytics , told me . Competition for workers led businesses to boost wages , with earnings jumping faster this fall than at any other point during the recovery . " The job market was pretty solid for    workers , " said Zandi . "   hikes helped , and you saw a lot of retailers and    restaurants get ahead of those increases too . " Indeed , economic growth started to reach down to       even poor families towards the end of the Obama administration . According to Census data , median household income jumped 5 . 2 percent between 2014 and 2015 , the first increase since 2007 ( though it is still lower than it it in 1999 , adjusting for inflation ) . Millions of people were lifted above the poverty line , with the drop in the poverty rate the biggest in a half century . Those trends are expected to continue next year . 2016 proved encouraging in financial markets as well . The total net worth of American households surged past $ 90 trillion , driven by a powerful buildup in the value of houses and stocks . At the national level , the housing market rose to new heights , though home prices remained below their home prices peak after accounting for inflation . The the housing market to heady new territory as well . But those aggregate ,    numbers deceive as much as they elucidate . those aggregate,    inequality became a dominant theme in the 2012 presidential election , given its power in Income inequality why steady growth and a booming stock market were leaving so many behind . Now , other sorts of disparities have taken on new importance . " In the recent past , the focus on inequality has all been about where you fall in the distribution , whether in the 10 percent , 1 percent , or top tenth of a percent , " said Jed Kolko , the chief economist at the    website Indeed . " Now that discussion is shifting to differences between groups , with those groups being geographic , and also different in terms of the types of jobs available and education levels . " It is these geographic inequalities that help to explain why the recovery left so many voters enraged , and the peculiar structure of the American electoral system explains why that rage proved so politically potent . The recovery has the recovery by yawning gaps between the rich , the middle , and the poor . But , as Trump ’s election made clear , it has also been the recovery by yawning gaps between cities , the suburbs , and rural parts of the country . " Once you go beneath those big , national , largely encouraging statistics , you see a lot of variation , " said Mark Muro , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . " This is about    cosmopolitan metropolitan areas pitted against    rural counties and some small metros . It is absolutely clear that the economic story has been much more difficult in that second group of     counties . " Indeed , the employment rate in rural areas was actually 2 . 9 percent lower in    than it was in early 2007 , just before the Great Recession started : There has been no jobs recovery in those    swaths of the country . The employment rate in metropolitan areas , in contrast , is 4 . 8 percent higher than its 2007 level , The employment rate in metropolitan areas businesses are adding jobs twice as fast in urban areas as they are in rural businesses . The    counties that boomed during the Clinton expansion started to lag during the Bush expansion , and really fell behind during the Obama expansion . the Bush expansion counties of large metros actually did better in the recession and recovery than they did " during the    The urban counties of large metros of the 2000s , Kolko said . And some metros are doing far better than others , with New York and the Bay Area in particular booming , minting millionaires and launching new businesses . ( One stark data point : Wages are so high in San Jose , San Francisco , and New York that some economists think New York housing to let more people move there would boost national economic output by an astounding 10 percent . ) The story is not just about New York beating rural Illinois , but New York beating St. Louis . Government policies New York made the country more equal across regions —   among them antitrust protections —   were forgotten or rolled Government policies that had made the country more equal across regions —  among them antitrust protections —   in the late 20th century . And fortunes diverged . According to a report from the Economic Innovation Group , an    research and advocacy organization , the economy is growing more and more reliant on a smaller and smaller number of " " counties , some of them in or near Los Angeles , Miami , the Economic Innovation Group, an   research and advocacy organization New York City . Just 20 counties , out of more than 3 , 000 nationwide , accounted for half of the net increase in new businesses between 2010 and 2014 . The number of counties seeing net job growth has dwindled , too . All in all , this adds up to , in the report ’s words , " a massive and historically unprecedented imbalance " in geographic dynamism . The kinds of jobs in places like Dallas and Las Vegas and San Francisco , versus eastern Kentucky or    Texas or the    Dakota border , might explain why the recovery feels more durable in denser areas , too . Workers in rural areas are far more likely to be involved in industries like farming , forestry , mining , and manufacturing , sectors in which job growth has been undercut and remains threatened by offshoring and automation . " These are thin economies .    …      Other than the hospital or local government , there is n’t a whole lot going on , " Zandi said . It ’s just stagnation . " Workers in urban areas , on the other hand , are more likely to be involved in knowledge or service jobs , like corporate law or home health work , that are harder to offshore or pass off to a robot —   which is true even for many jobs that are not particularly   . Rural areas are lagging their urban counterparts in terms of home values — Rural areas the single biggest component of most households’ net worth —   too . The rise in home values has been sharpest of late in coastal cities like Seattle and Boston . And the market for downtown luxury condos has recovered in a way that the market for exurban ranch homes has not , with the spoils concentrated on the high end . Data compiled by the    firm Weiss Analytics and reported by The Wall Street Journal shows that home prices in ZIP codes where the average house is worth $ 500 , 000 to $ 1 million are up 39 percent since the crash in places where houses are generally worth $ 100 , 000 to $ 150 , 000 , home prices are up just 16 percent . The    appreciation rate for houses in those cheaper , generally more rural ZIP codes is a quarter what it is for houses in those posher , generally more urban and coastal ZIP codes . As rural areas have stagnated and urban areas have become more vibrant ( as well as more unequal ) optimism itself has become more unevenly distributed during the recovery as well According to Gallup data , people living in big cities , urban suburbs , and college towns were the most sanguine about the overall economic outlook as of 2015 , and they had grown much more positive since 2009 — people living in big cities, urban suburbs, and college towns right when the recovery started to take off for them . the recovery in ( in Gallup ’s words people living in big cities, urban suburbs, and college towns " evangelical hubs , " the "   country , " " aging farmlands , " and " rural middle America , " on the other hand , were dour about the economy ’s prospects as of 2015 , and had become only somewhat more optimistic since the darkest days of the crisis . Race and ethnicity play into the geography of the recovery too : Black and Hispanic families are more the recovery live in urban areas than white families , and their representation in the workforce has grown through the recovery . Black and Hispanic families of 2015 , there were 66 million the recovery workers with    jobs , down from 72 million in 2007 . In contrast , according to Department of Labor data , the number of black    workers with    jobs remained roughly the same for Hispanic and Latino workers , it grew to 15 million from 13 . 6 million . More than half of the job gains since late 2007 have gone to Hispanics , who make up 14 percent of the labor force 29 percent of the job gains went to Asians , who make up 5 percent the job gains force and 25 percent of the job gains went to blacks , the labor force 11 percent of the the job gains according to an analysis from the Economic Cycle Research Institute , a nonpartisan think the labor force changes —   specifically , the workforce becoming less white —   explain much of the shift the workforce " part of the reason may be that these jobs , predominantly in [ the service sector ] were created in metropolitan areas , rather than in rural areas and small towns where factories were shuttered and the manufacturing jobs disappeared , " the report concluded . This hardly means that black the report workers have come out ahead of white workers in the recovery . By all accounts , white Americans continue to enjoy far the recovery conditions than do Americans of color . The unemployment rate for    white workers is just 3 . 7 percent . For black workers , it is 7 . 8 percent , and for Hispanic or Latino workers , 5 . 3 percent . Moreover , the racial wealth gap sits at its worst level in a generation and , as Valerie Wilson of the    Economic Policy Institute wrote , the " rise in the racial wealth gap wage inequality [ has ] mechanically separated black and white workers’ wages " over the past 35 years , since black workers were more likely to be working    jobs to begin with . Finally , variance in education levels has overlapped with place and race to create divergent experiences of the recovery . People in rural areas are less likely to have a college the recovery and the growth in the share of people completing college has been slower in rural areas too . But job gains during the recovery have been strongest among workers with more education , the Electoral College the economy adding the recovery 4 million jobs for the economy bachelor ’s degrees . Those jobs are clustered in big metro areas , not in rural ones . Taking these disparities into account , then , the state of the 4 million jobs for people with bachelor’s degrees well enough with the outcome of the the economy On the whole , Trump voters were as Trump to be employed as those who voted for Hillary Clinton . They Clinton on average , higher incomes . Many lived in places with an unemployment rate down in the neighborhood of 3 percent . Yet the trajectory of Trump voters communities felt far worse . Trump had extremely deep Trump in rural places that felt more stagnant , where the opportunities were dimmer , and where output and productivity were lower . To wit : Clinton ’s counties account for Clinton the nation ’s economic output , and Trump ’s just a Trump . For many voters , that sense of stagnation and being left behind mixed with the potent forces of racial animus , sexism , cultural disdain , and political polarization . Indeed , economic hardship alone may not explain Trump ’s victory so Trump a desire in some regions for a more general political   . Still , in the end , place , race , and class became far more important to understanding how the economy influenced voter behavior than anything that was happening to GDP or median the economy . And there are signs that that will continue to be true going forward . Democrats are sorting into        areas that are more racially diverse —   and hold less weight in the Electoral College . Republicans are sorting into        areas that are whiter —   and hold more weight . What can be done to revitalize those counties that feel left behind , that the recovery in many ways has bypassed ? That is the hard part . Policy is much better at redistributing money to individuals than it is at revitalizing regions . The federal government has every lever it needs to address income inequality , and very few to address the problems of living in an economy reliant Policy wheat prices , coal mines , or the operation of factories The federal government " We have a well    sense of    economies , " said Muro of the Brookings Institution , referring to economists’ understanding of cities . " Where we do n’t have many ideas at all is in terms of economies that do n’t have critical mass . One of the few ideas we have seems to be to invite people to move [ to them ] . " Economists do have a few other ideas . Infrastructure investment in struggling parts of the country we   building the country , say , or constructing a beautiful wall people a sparsely populated desert —   would help , though such implementation can take time . Policies to help certain industries through tariffs or tax incentives or government stimulus —   punishing foreign automakers , perhaps , or subsidizing American steel companies —   might even things out as well , and Trump has shown a remarkable Trump to meddle in companies’ internal affairs and boost certain businesses over others . But the truth is that the forces holding rural America back and pushing urban America forward are profound ones . Just as income inequality has become a fixture in many Americans’ understanding America the economy , so America must geographic inequality . And not just in election years . the economy
