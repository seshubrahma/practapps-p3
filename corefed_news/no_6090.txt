JERUSALEM ( AFP )   â€”     US President Donald Trump was said to have blazed a new trail between the Arab world and Israel Monday , with US President Donald Trump plane believed to be the first to fly directly from Saudi Arabia to the Jewish state . [ US President Donald Trump left Riyadh for Tel Aviv ahead of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in hopes of seeking ways to achieve    peace .   A spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel told AFP A spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel was not aware of any flight taking that course before . Israel has no diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia despite informal ties on certain levels , particularly around shared concerns over Iran . Any links are diplomatically delicate , with the Arab world strong supporters of the Palestinian cause . Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries to have signed peace deals with Israel . Israeli citizens , however , can travel to Saudi Arabia and thousands of Muslims attend the annual hajj pilgrimage there , flying with stopovers in neighbouring countries . A plane carrying reporters accompanying Trump had to stop in Cyprus rather than fly directly . Former aviation authority head Avner Yarkoni told AFP that while Israel would see no problem in a direct flight from Saudi Arabia , there was no reason Trump Trump precedent would open the way for a new route between Israel and the Gulf region .
