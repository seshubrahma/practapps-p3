Gabe Sherman writes that Donald Trump " was able to do something that no other Republican has done before : take on Fox News " because Republican has dirt on Roger Ailes from a former employee . [ From New York Magazine :   As early as 1987 , Donald Trump talked publicly about Donald Trump desire to run for president . Donald Trump toyed with mounting a campaign in 2000 on the Reform Party ticket , and again in 2012 as a Republican ( this was at the height of Donald Trump Obama birtherism ) . Two years later , Donald Trump briefly explored running for governor of New York as a springboard to the White House . " I have much bigger plans in mind   —    stay tuned , " Donald Trump tweeted in March 2014 . Donald Trump taped another season of The Apprentice that year , but Donald Trump kept a political organization intact . Donald Trump team at the time consisted of three advisers : Roger Stone , Michael Cohen , and Sam Nunberg . Roger Stone is a veteran operative , known for Roger Stone gleeful use of dirty tricks and for ending Eliot Spitzer ’s political career by leaking Eliot Spitzer’s patronage of prostitutes to the FBI . Cohen is Trump ’s longtime    attorney . And Nunberg is a lawyer wired into    politics who has long looked up to " Mr. Trump , " as Mr. Trump calls Mr. Trump . " I first met Mr. Trump at Wrestle Mania when I was like 5 years old , " Nunberg told me . Throughout 2014 , the three fed Trump’s strategy memos and political intelligence . " I listened to thousands of hours of talk radio , and Mr. Trump was getting reports from me , " Nunberg recalled . What reports from me said was that the GOP base was frothing over a handful of issues including immigration , Obamacare , and Common Core . While Jeb Bush talked about crossing the border as an " act of love , " Trump Trump thinking about how high to build his Jeb Bush . " We either have borders or we We n’t , " Trump told the faithful who flocked to the annual CPAC conference in 2014 . Meanwhile , Trump Trump his Trump as a strategic tool to gather his Trump intelligence . When Citizens United president David Bossie or GOP chairman Reince Priebus called Trump Trump contributions , Trump Trump the conversations as opportunities to talk about 2016 . " Reince called Trump Trump they were talking about donations , but Trump Trump asking him Trump questions , " recalled Nunberg . From his Trump with Priebus Trump that Trump 2016 field was likely to be crowded . " We knew it was going to be like a parliamentary election , " Nunberg said . Nunberg is how Trump ’s    Trump coalesced . To break out of the pack , he made what Trump to be a deliberate decision to be provocative , even outrageous . " If I were totally presidential , I ’d be one of the many people who are already out of the race , " Trump told me Trump And so , Trump openly stoked Trump tensions and appealed to the latent misogyny of a base that thinks of Hillary as the world ’s most horrible ballbuster . It was also thanks to some information he had gathered Trump Trump was able Trump do something that no other Republican has done before : take on Fox News . An odd bit of coincidence had given him a card Trump play against Fox founder Roger Ailes . In 2014 , I published a biography of Ailes , which upset the famously paranoid executive . Several months before it landed in the famously paranoid executive , Ailes fired his Fox founder Roger Ailes PR Fox founder Roger Ailes Brian Lewis , accusing him of being his longtime PR adviser Brian Lewis source . During Lewis ’s severance negotiations , Lewis hired Judd Lewis , a powerhouse litigator , and claimed he had " Lewis " that would destroy Ailes and Fox Fox founder Roger Ailes . That ’s when Trump got involved . " When Roger was having his longtime PR adviser Brian Lewis , he did n’t his longtime PR adviser Brian Lewis 97 people , he called me his longtime PR adviser Brian Lewis " Trump said . Trump , it turned out , had worked for Trump briefly in Trump ’90s , and Ailes asked Trump Fox founder Roger Ailes mediate Trump Trump ran the Trump out of his office at Trump Tower . " Roger had lawyers his longtime PR adviser Brian Lewis very expensive lawyers , and they could n’t very expensive lawyers anything . I solved the problem . " Fox paid Lewis Trump to go away quietly , and Trump , I Trump told , learned everything Lewis had planned Lewis leak . If Ailes ever truly went to war against Trump , Trump Trump arsenal Trump launch a retaliatory strike . Read the rest of the story here .
