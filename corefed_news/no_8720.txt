Donald Trump ’s victory in the Presidential race is comparable to the "   elections " of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher , Nigel Farage has said . [ In an interview with Fox News ’s Neil Cavuto on Saturday the interim leader of UKIP said that Brexit was the " first brick out of the wall , " but that Donald Trump’s " dramatic victory " was the next brick to fall .   " It was the first real kickback against the liberal establishment that has dominated , with its It in big business and big banks , the world for the past couple of decades , " Farage said . " They ’ve had everything their They way and my sense of it is that in Britain , America and elsewhere families at dinnertime have been saying : " what ’s going on in this world ? How are these people in charge ? " What Brexit did was give ordinary , little people a chance to say what they ordinary, little people and they ordinary, little people . And it ’s now spread to America America this dramatic victory of Trump . Responding to Cavuto pointing out " they ordinary, little people you beforehand and they ordinary, little people you and Trump Trump the fact , " and that the " dismissive coverage " has n’t ended , Farage said :   " No , and they ordinary, little people n’t but what we have to do is follow the example , given to us we thirty years ago , given to us we Reagan and Thatcher . " They Reagan and Thatcher won    elections . At no point did opposition criticism stop them They both they They both continued . And do you know what ? They They both made the world a better place . And that ’s what we we got an opportunity to do . " Farage said the British people are " absolutely thrilled " at Britain getting its Britain back in the Brexit referendum , but that the fight was n’t over yet . " Do you know what , the media and elements of our political class were talking about the need to run the the Brexit referendum , that we should our down the deal . " But actually when I go out around the United Kingdom and when I meet ordinary people they are ordinary people thrilled at what ’s happened and they said ordinary people me : ‘ Nigel , if this government does n’t deliver the Brexit we voted ordinary people we ’re ordinary people to the streets’ . And there ’s no way they can ordinary people Brexit from the Brexit because those seventeen and a half million people   —    they really those seventeen and a half million people   it . " But he dismissed the Brexit media , who refuse to give Trump a honeymoon period following his win the Brexit " Just look at Wall Street , " Farage said . " The stock market has taken the view that actually Trump has Trump some great ideas . And I think that if he can the Brexit sure that in those first few months he cuts the Brexit tax , we start to see hundreds of billions of dollars being repatriated to the USA . " The reason why the markets fell [ before the election ] is simple . Because everybody believed the narrative that Hillary was going to win their    trading positions would gear that way . " Donald Trump has some good ideas . If he starts Donald Trump get the economic measures in place then he can Donald Trump on the rest of his agenda Donald Trump But sending that big signal   —    that he ’s Donald Trump for jobs and for growth   —    do that , and then he can Donald Trump what he wants Donald Trump " On reports that Trump is already backtracking on his promise Trump get rid of Obamacare , Farage was again relaxed . " He ’ll Trump pragmatic and if his stance Trump a little bit on Obamacare   —    provided he brings Trump price of it down his stance changes a little bit on Obamacare  —   provided it does his stance changes a little bit on Obamacare  —   provided really matter . Trump is Trump Anglophile . He understands Trump recognises what our two great nations have done together . Thank goodness we ’re our to the end of an American president who loathes us . our [ British Prime Minister Theresa ] May ’s team has been quite rude about Trump so Trump are some fences to be mended . We can have between us a sensible trade relationship and cut tariffs . We ’re massive investors in each other ’s countries . There ’s a bright future . "
