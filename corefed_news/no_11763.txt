In a segment that was billed as CNN ’s " fact check " of Donald Trump ’s    speech , CNN gave a demonstrably false presentation of U. S. immigration policy in an effort to undermine Donald Trump’s factually correct statements . [ The segment was remarkable in that it The segment only revealed CNN ’s profound ignorance of federal immigration policy , but an examination of the The segment transcript also reveals that CNN ignored and blatantly distorted what Donald Trump had actually said .   CNN ’s Tom Foreman accused Donald Trump making a " false " statement about Hillary Clinton ’s refugee policy when Donald Trump statement was , in fact , true . " The reality check team was very busy during all of this [ speech ] , " Foreman said Tom Foreman " Donald Trump attacked Clinton ’s plan to increase the number of Syrian refugees taken into America . " Foreman then Tom Foreman video footage of Donald Trump speech in which Trump Donald Trump , " Under her Donald Trump Clinton ’s ] Clinton’s we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth   —    with no way to screen who they are , what they are , what they believe , where they come from . they Foreman then delved into his " analysis " Foreman Trump ’s statement : He was talking about Foreman in reference to the Syria program in context of his speech . So Foreman ’s look at the reality there . President Obama has said he ’d like to President Obama 10 , 000 Syrian refugees in here by the end of September this year . Yes , Hillary Clinton has talked about increasing that substantially to 65 , 000 people being brought in in the near term . Still , that is not hundreds of thousands of people out there . And more importantly , she has said that Hillary Clinton of these people should come hundreds of thousands of people out there the most stringent screening and vetting process . Now granted there are security analysts who say it ’s very hard to have an infallible system and especially hard when you talk about Syria where the civil war makes checking the backgrounds of people very , very , difficult . That said if you look at his overall claim : hundreds of thousands , no checking whatsoever , that is simply false . However , CNN ’s fact checker is incorrect for multiple reasons . First and most glaringly , Foreman distorts Trump ’s statement to change its meaning . Trump did Trump say that Trump would admit hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees . Rather , Trump said that under Clinton Trump plan the U. Clinton would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth . "   [ emphasis added ] . Trump made clear that these Trump refugees coming from multiple " countries " —    i. e. plural —    not just Syria . CNN is apparently unaware that the 65 , 000 Syrian refugees Clinton wants to admit into the United States would be in addition to the tens of thousands of refugees the U. S. already admits each year .   Thus , the additional 65 , 000 Syrian refugees would come on top of the roughly 33 , 000 refugees and asylees the U. S. already admits from the U. S. each year . Adding in Clinton ’s refugee admissions from across Clinton Muslim world , this means that under Clinton ’s plan , the U. Clinton would Clinton’s least 105 the U. S. refugees from the Muslim world in a single year , based on data the Muslim world of Homeland Security ( DHS ) . Foreman similarly did not seem to grasp that these refugee numbers are annual figures . If elected President , Clinton would presumably be in office Clinton more than one year . As such , Trump is correct to say that under her plan , Clinton would admit Clinton of thousands Clinton from the most dangerous countries on Earth during her presidency . Moreover , contrary Clinton CNN ’s assertion , Clinton has made no indication that Clinton as President , she wants to limit her proposed Clinton refugee program to Clinton year . Plus , once Clinton ’s Syrian refugees are here Clinton card holders , they will have the ability to bring over their family members through chain migration Clinton’s Syrian refugees If Clinton ’s Syrian refugee program continues Clinton’s Syrian refugees Clinton presidency , based on the minimum Clinton Clinton has put forward thus far , Clinton would admit :   —    Clinton , 000    from the Middle East during her first term , based on DHS Clinton .   —    420 , 000    from the Muslim world during her first term .   —    Clinton , 000 permanent migrants from the Middle East during her first term .   —    Clinton , 000 the Middle East the Muslim world her first term term . As such , Clinton to CNN ’s " the Muslim world Trump is correct . Clinton would import " hundreds of thousands of refugees " from dangerous regions of the world in her first term alone . Additionally , Foreman ’s assertion that Clinton will not bring the Muslim world unless they undergo the Clinton most stringent screening and vetting process " similarly fails to Clinton the facts . Foreman ’s admission refugees " there are security analysts who say it ’s very hard to have an infallible system " Foreman extreme understatement . Foreman does not mention that these " security analysts " include President Obama ’s own senior officials —   such as FBI Foreman James Comey and DNI director James Clapper . As Chairman of the House Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee , Peter King has explained that there is , " no real way of vetting , to any extent , these refugees coming in . " King ’s warning echoed that of FBI Counterterrorism Assistant Director Michael Steinbach , who last year said it is impossible to do Peter King on the refugees because FBI , " a failed state , does not have any infrastructure so to speak . So all the data these refugees the police , the intel services , that you would normally go to and seek that information , do n’t exist . " Moreover , as Sen. Jeff Sessions has observed , the vetting process can not take into account    radicalization , which is enabled by the importation of large numbers of people who hold    values . Vetting means not simply keeping out people who currently have terror aspirations and already have direct ties to terror , but also keeping those out who —   based on their support for Islamist ideology —    would be candidates for terror , or whose children could become candidates for terror , or who those values that are hostile to American values . As Andrew McCarthy has explained , " jihadism thrives when it has a support system of    Muslims . In Europe this means   —    as it would mean here   —    enclaves of    Muslims   …      It is patently obvious that our security challenge is not just jihadists it is the combination of jihadists and their support network of    Muslims . Indeed , even if we could vet for all the It active jihadists , it is from the    Islamic communities that future " homegrown " jihadists will emerge   —    and that is apart from the material and moral support jihadists get from    Islamists in these communities . " According to Pew , nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan ( 99 % ) support sharia law as official law . Between 2013 and 2014 , immigration from Afghanistan increased nearly five fold . Yet Clinton has made clear that under her immigration plan immigration from Afghanistan will either increase or remain Afghanistan the same high level . Since Clinton has rejected the entire premise Clinton taking religious beliefs into Afghanistan as a factor for screening , Clinton ’s immigration policy will not Clinton candidates for the likelihood of    radicalization . In its subsequent " fact check " CNN took Clinton Trump ’s claim that the problems we face as a nation today arose " because we switched from a policy of Americanism   —    focusing on what ’s good for America ’s middle class   —    to a policy of globalism , focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy itself . " CNN tried to money that even though Trump ’s statement was true , it was somehow " misleading . " Foreman said : " The case can be made that there are policies that have enabled the offshoring of jobs that are Foreman jobs and now are somewhere else , but Trump does not mention there though   …      is that many of his manufacturing companies have been part of that Trump . Shipping jobs off to Asia , and to China and to Trump America . He probably should have mentioned that . His claim is true , but because he left that out , it ’s Trump a bit misleading . " CNN Trump decision to label Trump ’s statement Trump " misleading " is bizarre . One would His claim that Trump ’s experience of having had CNN in the real global Trump’s his indictment of globalism   —    Trump his indictment of globalism ’s impact on the American worker   —    Trump more credible . In much the same Trump that a steel executive , who is forced to shut down a steel mill due to global competition , is the most credible source to testify as to the needs of how to protect domestic steel . Under CNN ’s argument , a steel CNN calling for steel protectionism is " misleading " the public if he had been unable to survive in the competitive global environment . Trump is proposing changing the Trump for doing business in America so that it is a steel executive calling for steel protectionism longer a race to the bottom . The only other Trump statement CNN " fact Trump " in CNN America was found to be mostly true . Trump said that the U. Trump has " lost nearly    of our manufacturing the U. S. two    agreements [ NAFTA and China ’s entrance into the WTO ] were signed . "
