Washington ( CNN ) It is a staple of Donald Trump ’s stump speech , intended to show that the country is experiencing a frightening crime wave .   " Last year we saw a 17 % increase in violent crime in our 50 largest cities , " Donald Trump’s often says . Donald Trump’s used to say that Donald Trump’s was a 17 % increase in homicides in the country ’s 50 largest cities . Donald Trump’s now says that increase is in " violent crimes . " Since Donald Trump’s does not say what Donald Trump’s considers violent crimes , it is difficult to check Donald Trump’s figures . A yearly survey conducted by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicide , rape , robbery , aggravated assault and    shootings increased by about 2 % in 65 major jurisdictions .   ( The chiefs’ association list includes large counties such as Los Angeles County and Prince Georges County , Maryland     outside Washington     as well as cities such as Pittsburgh , Newark , New Jersey , and Cincinnati that are not among the nation ’s 50 largest . ) But if Trump ’s claim is that the number of homicides in 2015 was 17 % larger than the number of murders in 2014 , he Trump closer to the mark . The major chiefs association survey showed that murders did increase by nearly 16 % among its Trump . And a survey of the country ’s 30 largest cities done by New York University ’s Brennan Center for Justice indicated an increase in homicides of 14 % . But these numbers do not represent an     increase in homicides for major jurisdictions , nor that an unprecedented wave of killings is hitting virtually all big cities .   In fact , only three cities     Baltimore , Chicago and Washington     account for more than half of the national increase in murders , according to the Brennan Center survey . If you take those three cities out of the equation , the number of murders only jumped by about 7 % in the nation ’s largest cities .    " I think Trump ’s figure is more misleading than inaccurate , " said Inimai M. Chettiar , the director of the Justice Program at the the Brennan Center Verdict : True , but misleading .
