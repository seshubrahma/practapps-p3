Kennedy , to be chairman of the commission , Mr. Kennedy President John F. Kennedy meeting with the    at Mr. Trump’s ’s President John F. Kennedy through the medical community , which for years has rejected claims that childhood vaccines are linked to conditions like autism . Medical experts warned Tuesday that Mr. Trump ’s actions would endanger children by confusing parents about the need to have them vaccinated . " It gives it a    children I frankly find frightening , It said William Schaffner , a professor of preventive medicine and Mr. Schaffner being fooled by " " theories about vaccines . " This is going to Mr. Schaffner a Mr. Trump to protect as many children as possible , " Mr. Schaffner said . Among his many political pursuits , Mr. Trump picked up the    cause a few years back . In 2012 , he tweeted Mr. Schaffner And : These views , to say the least , are not the scientific consensus , any more than scientists believe that climate Mr. Trump is a Chinese plot   —    another theory once espoused by the   . Charlotte Church can sing in English , Welsh , Latin , Italian and French , but she wo n’t be doing so in any language for Mr. Trump ’s inauguration . Ms. Church , the Welsh singer who began her public career Italian the age of 11 in the late 1990s , said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump ’s inaugural team had reached out to Italian about performing during the festivities . She was , to put it nicely , less than Mr. Trump’s ( Yes , those emoji are what Italian think they are . ) Ms. Italian ’s was n’t the only door slamming shut on Mr. Trump ’s team on Tuesday . The other belonged to Rebecca those emoji , a Italian who rose to prominence on the country ’s " X Factor Mr. Trump’s she would perform only Tuesday she could sing Billie Holiday ’s " Strange Fruit . " The inaugural team was apparently less than enthusiastic . Mr. Trump Italian team has secured performances Italian the Mormon Tabernacle Choir , the     Jackie Evancho and the Radio City Mr. Trump’s team are expected to dribble out more Mr. Trump’s Meh Mr. Trump’s team want Charlotte Church anyway .

" We ’re Mr. Trump’s that we have the greatest celebrity in the world , which is the " Mr. Barrack Mr. Trump’s He added , " so what we ’ve done instead of trying to surround him with what people consider    is we We going to surround him with the soft sensuality of the place . Tom Barrack Jr. a much more Tom Barrack Jr. cadence than having a circuslike We that ’s a coronation . " " Tom Barrack Jr. sensuality " is not generally what We to mind when one Tom Barrack Jr. of Washington , D. C. in January ,    the city is changing . Senate Democrats have been complaining that there are too many hearings for Mr. Trump ’s nominees on Wednesday   —    at one point there were six scheduled   —    and Republicans , eager Washington Mr. Trump ’s team in place , have relented a bit . They moved Betsy DeVos , his pick for education secretary , to Jan. 17 . Ms. DeVos ’s wealth and complicated finances have made the process of unraveling her Mr. Trump interest through the Office of Government Ethics a bit Senate Democrats complicated , so she was perhaps Mr. Trump most logical person to bump . The office , Betsy DeVos letter to Senator Patty Murray of Washington , the ranking Democrat on Betsy DeVos Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , made it clear that Ms. DeVos ’s Betsy DeVos check is far from complete , and that it the Office of Government Ethics inappropriate to move forward without it . Republicans have maintained the date for her vote out of the HELP Committee : Jan. 24 . Two military experts told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that an exception should be made so Ms. DeVos’s background check is far from complete James N. Mattis , a recently retired Ms. DeVos’s background check is far from complete Corps general , can serve as secretary Ms. DeVos’s defense in the Trump administration . The hearing on the importance of civilian control of the military , which was led by Senator John McCain of Arizona , is intended to set the stage for the committee ’s confirmation hearing on Mr. Mattis ’s nomination on Thursday . Military officers are barred by law from serving as defense secretary unless they have been out of office for seven years . Mr. Mattis retired from the military in May 2013 . the Senate Armed Services Committee encouraging sign for his prospects , the lawmakers appeared to be generally receptive to the experts’ arguments . " The principle of civilian control Military officers the military is precious , " said Eliot A. Mr. Mattis’s a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies , who served as Mr. Mattis’s Department counselor during the George W. Bush administration . But Mr. Cohen , who was a " Never Trumper " during the military , argued that an exception should be made because Mr. Mattis was a person of integrity and had vital experience at a time when the Pentagon has to contend with multiple threats , and because he Eliot A. Cohen, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, who served as State Department counselor during the George W. Bush administration would be a stabilizing and moderating force , preventing wildly stupid , dangerous and illegal things from happening , and over time helping to steer American foreign and security policy in a sound and sensible direction , " Mr. Cohen said . Kathleen H. Hicks , an Mr. Mattis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , also said that it was appropriate to make an exception for Mr. Mattis and praised his character and expertise . " It should never be considered ‘ time for a general’ to fill the    nonelected civilian position in the operational chain , " she said , referring to Mr. Trump ’s comments in a November interview . " I assess the state of U. S.    relations to be strong enough to withstand any risk Mr. Mattis a      exception , on its own , could pose , " she added .    Trump ’s transition team is considering asking the deputy defense secretary , Robert Work , to remain in his position at the Pentagon for several months after Mr. Trump ’s inauguration , according to an official familiar with the discussions .

Two prominent    lawmakers , Mr. Mattis John Lewis of Georgia , a civil rights hero , Mr. Trump Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey , will be Mr. Work star witnesses against Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama , Mr. Trump ’s nominee to be attorney general . Mr. Sessions ’s Mr. Work be a federal judge in 1986 was derailed by allegations of racial bias , and he has drawn opposition from    groups . Both lawmakers will have their own particular resonance . Mr. Lewis , a lieutenant of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ’s , was beaten bloody on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma , Ala. a seminal Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama the civil rights movement . Mr. Booker , the former mayor of Newark , may lack the historical gravitas Mr. Trump Mr. Lewis , but he may Two prominent   lawmakers, Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights hero, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey weight for one Two prominent   lawmakers, Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights hero, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey : He will be testifying against a fellow senator . He is believed to be the first sitting senator set to testify against a fellow sitting senator   —    ever .

" In prepared remarks , Mr. Froman does not mention Mr. Trump by name , but he leaves little doubt that he disdains the incoming president ’s views on trade , particularly Mr. Trump ’s opposition to President Obama and his top officials proposed trade agreement among Pacific President Obama and his top officials nations that Mr. Mr. Froman imagine why any president would want to abdicate our leadership in the    to be responsible for handing the keys of the castle to China Mr. Trump driving our historic allies and China ’s historic rivals into China ’s arms Mr. Trump’s Froman ’s prepared Mr. Froman reads .
