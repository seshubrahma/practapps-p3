Columnist Charles Krauthammer stated Republican presidential candidate and Columnist Charles Krauthammer supporters " are the victims " in the violence that broke out at one of Columnist Charles Krauthammer events in Chicago , and should n’t be blamed , but that it ’s " really unconscionable " Trump would n’t condemn an attendee at another rally punching a demonstrator on Monday ’s " Special Report " on the Fox News Channel .   Krauthammer said [ relevant remarks begin around 2:30 ] " The one , obviously , what happened in Chicago , is organized , and this is the far left , also the far right , we saw it in the 20s and the 30s , the tactic of shutting the opposition down , and it is n’t only something happening in presidential politics . This is happening on campus all the time . Speakers who are n’t allowed to speak , outside of the Trumps and the others . We ’re just talking about the norm on campus , which is that , the left acts in a totalitarian way to control who speaks . That ’s a phenomenon . That should be condemned , and then Trump , and the supporters , who are the victims here , are not to be blamed . " He continued , " There ’s a second phenomenon . Which is other events which are happening in Trump events , and you get   …     Trump winking and nodding saying , you know , in the old days He ’d be carried Trump in a stretcher , meaning , we used to beat people like Trump until people were unable to walk . we saw on tape , a guy hitting ,    a demonstrator , in the face , and saying , if we see He again , we may have to kill He . That ’s lynch talk . And when asked about it , Trump said , ‘ I do n’t condone it.’ That ’s great . But Trump refused to condemn it . And that I think is really unconscionable . " Krauthammer further said it was " even worse " that Trump was considering paying the legal fees of the man who punched the demonstrator . Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
