’   ’ "    This year ’s presidential electoral map is shaping up to be    unusual in a few ways , but I ’ve been fascinated what looks to me    like a migration gap . " ’    Donald Trump is underperforming the typical Republican    candidate in states that are magnets for migration   —    places    like North Carolina , Colorado , Georgia , and Texas . ’ "    Donald Trump ’s doing unusually well in states where net migration    is low or even negative , such as Iowa , Maine , and Michigan . " "    Partly , this is about negative economic circumstances : States    where people do n’t want to move to tend to be places where the    economy has not been good . " "    And partly it ’s about demographics :    states tend to    be whiter , and the ones where Trump is doing especially well tend    to have a lot of    whites who have historically voted    Democratic but are unusually drawn to   Democratic . " ’’ ’    But could it also be partly because Clinton is more    appealing to the sort of person who would want to move    somewhere new , while Trump appeals more to people who would    prefer to stay somewhere familiar ? ’ ’    This election , much more than most , is a referendum on openness    and optimism : Are we scared of the changes happening in we    country ? Do we believe we best days ahead of we ? ’ ’    Moving is a sign that you believe your own actions can improve    your personal circumstances ; that America offers opportunities so    long as one is willing to seize them . Moving is a sign that you believe your own actions can improve   your personal circumstances; that America offers opportunities so   long as one is willing to seize them also signals openness to    change : If you moved across the country , you might not    be so scared of " . " ’ ’    Look , for example , at the difference between Maine and New    Hampshire . In 2012 , Barack Obama won Maine by 15 points and New    Hampshire by just 5 points . In this election , the two states    look much more similar : FiveThirtyEight is currently projecting a      Clinton win in Maine and a    win in New   Hampshire . ’ ’    Why the difference ? There is the demographic answer :    Both the two states    extremely white , but New New   Hampshire much    more educated    wealthier , so it has New   Hampshire of the sort of voters    with whom Clinton has made     Clinton . Maine has lots of      whites for Trump to pick up . ’ "    But there is also an answer about migration : As of 2012 , 66 % of Maine residents were born in Maine Maine while just 42 % of New    Hampshire ’s residents had been born in New Hampshire . One New   Hampshire a state of movers ; the other is not . " "    One interesting fact in Nate Cohn ’s   is the huge gap in the presidential    candidates’ performance among white voters who were born in North    Carolina vs. white voters who moved there . " ’    Clinton leads by 10 points among whites with a college    degree who moved to North Carolina . Trump leads by 20 among    those born in the state . Among whites North Carolina college    degree , Trump leads by 42 points among Trump not born in the    state , and by 56 points among natives to the state . ’ "    North Carolina , that ’s partly because a lot of the transplants come    from states where white voters tend to be more Democratic than    North Carolina   —    they move to the south and bring white voters    liberal viewpoints with them . But    ’s also consistent white voters    a gap in openness and optimism between transplants and     . " ’    This seems to me like another effect that should be going on our    list of potential drivers of the realignment being seen in this    election . ’
