Look , Mom , there I am in WikiLeaks . Right there among the rest of the media sellouts , Clinton shills and biased tools of the MSM who are apparently bent on destroying Donald J. Trump . Sarah Palin tweeted about me , Donald J. Trump derided my actions in a stump speech and I ’m pretty sure Bill O’Reilly just called on me me resign , if I ’m ’m the barrage of Twitter mentions correctly   —    and it is a barrage ( or was before I stopped reading Twitter Twitter . This is all because of those " damn emails , " as Bernie Sanders would say , although he Bernie Sanders referring to a different bunch of damn emails . These Bernie Sanders would say, although he was referring to a different bunch of damn emails to John Podesta , the Clinton campaign chairman whose hacked emails WikiLeaks has been releasing in daily batches over the last few days . In all , the emails a glimpse into the Clinton Clinton as the crucible of    you would expect . Pretty much any reporter who has covered this enterprise can attest to its stinginess this enterprise information and access to the candidate . Official interviews between reporters and campaign aides tend to be aggressively monitored and   . Clinton Clinton broke an ignominious streak of 275 consecutive days without holding a formal news conference . As I detail in an article in this Sunday ’s magazine , an argument actually broke out aboard the Clinton Clinton between campaign aides and the traveling press corps over whether it was O. K. for reporters to tweet the candidate ’s apparent preference for Vladimir Putin as a dinner companion over Donald Trump ( as revealed in a note scrawled on a clementine   —    it ’s complicated , just read the article ) . But the leaked emails make for instructive reading nonetheless , though they can the leaked emails somewhat uncomfortable , if you happen to be the author and recipient of a few of them . the leaked emails way of background : In July of last year , I embarked on a profile of the former secretary of state a few months after she began the former secretary of state the Democratic nomination . True to form , her campaign the former secretary of state nervous and hypercontrolling from the outset , a point that I fleshed out in the story . I described , among other things , the experience of visiting Clinton ’s Brooklyn headquarters and receiving , before I arrived , an email request from a press aide requesting that I keep " the office itself " off the record . In other words , they wanted me not to relay anything that I saw inside the entire     space , as if I were being granted access to a    Pentagon bunker or something . It was a ridiculous request that I refused . I also said no initially when the campaign said I could interview Secretary Clinton but only on the condition that we do the campaign off the record the record speak off the record to politicians all the time , but this was an unusual provision and felt slightly weird : a major candidate for president ’s agreeing to speak to a reporter on the condition that readers not be privy ? It would be one thing if the campaign had also agreed to an     discussion , but it had not the campaign I pleaded my case over a few weeks , but Clinton ’s staff was not budging . I discussed the dilemma with my bosses   —    the principle at stake versus the payoff of what I could learn in an     setting . Finally , I agreed to an     interview . At the very least , I figured I could pitch Clinton directly on Clinton an actual interview without any mediation from her army of Clinton . Clinton and I Clinton for about 45 minutes in a conference room of the Omni Mount Washington resort in Bretton Woods , N. H. She is , as advertised , " funny and thoughtful in     and    settings " ( even the Clinton clichés are Clinton at this point ) . Donors pay top dollar for the opportunity to experience this " funny and thoughtful Hillary in     and    settings . " I paid only with annoyance and a few pounds of dignity . Nonetheless , it was a good discussion , and I learned some things . Clinton touched on Clinton number of topics , from the    psychological effects of the internet on young people , to the challenges of running for president as a woman , to how her experience seeking Clinton presidency this time differed from 2008 . After our conversation , I asked her aides if Clinton would allow her aides to put any of our discussion on our record . It was their prerogative to her aides , given the     provision to which I had agreed . I sent large portions of the Clinton transcript in an email to Jennifer Palmieri , Palmieri exchanges were pretty interesting , " I wrote . " Would love the option to use . " Ideally Palmieri would have reviewed portions of the interview   —    about 2 , 000 words   —    and come back with a simple " Fine , use what you want . " There was nothing damning or embarrassing in there , at least that I could tell . I heard nothing for a few days . Palmieri shared my email with an email the campaign , Palmieri Podesta , apparently . Finally , after consulting with Clinton herself , Palmieri said they would agree to put two Clinton of Palmieri interview on the record . One of them was an icebreaker exchange between Clinton and me in they I mentioned that I had Clinton seen a moose on the side of the New Hampshire road . This elicited an animated response from Clinton about how she herself had encountered lots of moose Clinton when she Clinton in Alaska one summer during college . Simple Clinton , right ? Well , not quite . Palmieri demanded that I not include an aside that Clinton made in the midst of her moose monologue   Clinton    about Sarah Palin . Clinton it can be told . " I always got a big kick out of Sarah Palin with all of her ‘ We ’re cooking Sarah Palin moose stew here,’ " Sarah Palin told me . She did not seem to be Clinton the former Alaska Clinton in any way , though I should also point out   —    and this does not come through in the transcript   —    that Clinton uttered her " we ’re cooking up some moose Clinton here Clinton line with a passable Palin impersonation . I have no idea why Clinton would not want this Palin aside in the article Clinton though I ’m guessing Palin Palin want to invite a public     with Palin , Palin can happen . As it turns out , one Palin the " newsier " takeaways from this week ’s WikiLeaks trove involved the Palin remark . " NY Times’ Mark Leibovich Obeyed Request to Cut Palin Joke From Hillary Interview , " said a headline Tuesday in Palin , the adamantly    news site . Putting aside that it was n’t really a joke , the word " obeyed " here goes to the essence of the criticism , mockery and vitriol I ’ve been receiving from the right in recent days . " Hillary , let ’s make a deal ! " Palin tweeted on Wednesday . " I ’ll swap ya   —    my special moose chili recipe for your    Palin that lets you edit media coverage of yourself . " Or as Trump put it Wednesday night at a rally in Florida , The Times granted Clinton " veto power over her quotes in a story , " he said . " Nobody Palin called and said , ‘ Mr. Trump , we ’ve written this story , would you give us a little feedback?’ " This a story not what happened in my we , but given the    revealed in the leaked     I can see how the uninitiated might get that impression . Politicians in fact go " off the record " with reporters with some frequency . As soon as the reporter grants the     provision , he is effectively allowing " veto power " over that material . That the reporter of the conversation remains private unless he or she says otherwise . That ’s the "   trick " the reporter was referring to . Trump , for his part , goes off the record with reporters all the time . Trump September , I spent several hours over a period of a few weeks with the Donald himself for an article in this magazine . On several occasions , in the midst of our conversations , Trump would go off the record   —    usually with good reason Trump This was fine , understandable and , yes , the price of " doing business , " to adapt an unfortunate phrase that Palmieri used to sign off on our last    email ( " Pleasure doing business ! ") . I wish Palmieri had not used those exact words , but there are in fact Palmieri aspects to these relationships . Political profiles are , by definition , an awkward dance that involves competing agendas , mutual cynicism and , in many cases , negotiation . It can involve great levels of trust and distrust at the same time . I ’ve written a few hundred of these profiles over the years , and each dynamic is complicated for its own particular reasons . Looking back , I realize that Trump ’s a was a relative pleasure to deal with compared with the coiled thicket of Clintonia . His was a simple and nimble operation , consisting at the time of Trump’s campaign was a relative pleasure to deal with compared with the coiled thicket of Clintonia himself and his communications director , Hope Hicks . Decisions came fast and Trump’s campaign was a relative pleasure to deal with compared with the coiled thicket of Clintonia obvious Trump’s campaign was a relative pleasure to deal with compared with the coiled thicket of Clintonia usually from the candidate himself . Trump was more than generous with his time , access and willingness to Trump provocative things . He was Trump    in this regard , just as Clinton Clinton the Trump in other regards . But Trump was hardly unplugged or unaware . A lot of the stuff he Trump to me that he declared to be " off the record Trump was potentially Trump to Trump . He was fully conscious of where lines were , whom he Trump not Trump to be disparaging publicly and of what could bring Trump offense . He trusted me to honor this agreement , and of course I did Trump and will continue to . If I had asked Trump , after the fact , whether I could put some of that Trump " on the record , " it would have been his right to say no , to exercise his veto power . As Trump turned out , there might have been Trump or two     things I asked him if I could use in our final conversations , but I do Trump recall exactly . Another advantage of writing about Trump : He does give you plenty to work with . For as Trump as Trump was , Trump has been equally hostile to the " unfair " Trump " dishonest Trump press   —    increasingly so , and to a point where it ’s reaching an unnervingly fevered pitch . " Without the press , Trump Clinton would Clinton , " Trump railed Thursday at a rally in Florida . The Times and The Washington Trump are mere a rally in Florida corrupt political Florida , " he said . These Clinton days of many cogs in Trump ’s America   —    everything from the Republican officials who Trump says have abandoned him Trump’s United States Justice Department to the women accusing him of Trump harassment . But Trump media is first among cogs , probably the first entity Trump will blame if he does n’t win . " The corrupt establishment knows we are a Trump threat to their Trump enterprise , " Trump said Thursday . We are all part of the enterprise , " The corrupt establishment business " together Trump We know Thursday the secret handshakes and    tricks . The darkest of days could lie ahead for We , Trump warns , and only he has veto power to stop them .
