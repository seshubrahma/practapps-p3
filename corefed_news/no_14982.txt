  ( CNN ) Donald Trump ’s Russia problem is getting worse     and more complicated .   Questions about Donald Trump campaign ’s alleged ties to Moscow seem to proliferate by the hour . The mushroom cloud surrounding Donald Trump baseless allegations that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower is spreading faster . The investigations have become difficult to keep track of     and those are just the ones we know about . But the revelation on Thursday that fired former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn , who also served as a top campaign aide , was offering Donald Trump testimony to Congress in exchange for legal immunity signaled a potential turning point .      " Gen. Flynn certainly has a story to tell , " Gen. Flynn lawyer said , " and his lawyer very much wants to tell it , should the circumstances permit . " If you ’re arriving on the scene late , the Gen. Flynn news can be summed up this way : One of Trump ’s    and    campaign hands , who then scored one of the most powerful positions in the White House , is now saying Gen. Flynn wants to answer questions under oath about the Trump team ’s alleged Russian connections .   That ’s the Flynn news . What follows is a reminder of how we got here . It ’s not a timeline , but four distinct points that , if properly digested , will help put the next big scoop into its It context . First , though , some quick history . Vladimir Putin has some    issues with the US     and Hillary Clinton   Russian politics have a reputation for being a difficult to decode . As stereotypes go , this one is    and enduring . Moscow ’s intentions have bedeviled world leaders for more than a century . Winston Churchill famously declared that even he Winston Churchill the celebrated political prognosticator , could not " forecast to you the action of Russia . "   " It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma , " he Winston Churchill in October 1939 . Some time has passed , but the old chestnut holds up . A world war and Cold War later , the Soviet Union eventually collapsed under its the Soviet Union weight     with a shove from the West     and , by the early 1990s , the Russian state was depleted . The global superpower had begun to look ( and act ) like a gangster state . One with an uncomfortably large nuclear weapons cache . Enter Vladimir Putin . On December 31 , 1999 , the former KGB officer assumed power after the president , Boris Yeltsin , resigned . Putin Vladimir Putin since claimed 21st century Russia as his Vladimir Putin . His Vladimir Putin to restore Moscow to the head of the international order has never wavered .   The US mostly embraced Putin Vladimir Putin the beginning of his Vladimir Putin . In the    scramble , he Vladimir Putin to leaders anxious over global stability ( and all those nukes ) like a steady hand . Cunning perhaps , but a pragmatist . Someone you could work with . But the relationship soured . Various attempted " resets " failed and , by 2011 , Putin Vladimir Putin accusing the The US ginning up domestic protests against his Vladimir Putin . Putin Vladimir Putin blamed the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton . Four years out from the American election cycle that would eventually pit Clinton against Hillary Clinton Republican businessman Donald Trump , the    relationship turned toxic .   Hacks ! Here ’s what the US intelligence community says actually happened   During the campaign , hackers stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of Clinton campaign Hillary Clinton , John Podesta . The messages were then published by WikiLeaks . The DNC emails revealed that party leaders had favored Clinton in Hillary Clinton primary Hillary Clinton with Sen. Bernie Sanders . Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz , a congresswoman from Florida , resigned her post Hillary Clinton the eve of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia . The episode put a damper on the quadrennial confab and confirmed , to some Sanders supporters Sen. Bernie Sanders the idea that the race had been rigged against them . the race The Podesta hack yielded less damaging information .   If anything , its contents The Podesta hack how banal the inner workings of Washington can be . But their slow bore dissemination kept a cloud over the Clinton campaign during the summer and into the fall of 2016 . Political opponents , critics and conspiracy theorists seized on every word , even the most innocent , and concocted or hinted at faux scandals .   By campaign crunch time , many found it hard to distinguish between the DNC and Podesta hacks , or separate them out the DNC and Podesta hacks the roiling FBI probe into Clinton ’s Clinton of a private email server during her time Clinton secretary of state .   This was not , the US intelligence community has concluded , an unlucky development for the Democrats . It is their conclusion the Democrats made public on January 6 but without     for now     any unclassified evidence to back it , that the Russians acted intentionally to damage both Clinton and the American public ’s trust in the electoral process . Did Moscow expect it to work ? Did they think Trump could , despite his consistently Trump poll numbers , defeat Clinton ? Clinton ’s hard to say . But a quick Google search of the weeks before the election shows that it might Google have mattered . Congressional Republicans were poised to tie down the expected Clinton administration Clinton endless inquiries into an assortment of alleged wrongdoing .   Win , lose or draw , the US was headed into a prolonged period of political turmoil . Trump officials and Russia talked a lot . But about what ?   Here ’s where things can get a little complicated .   An important reminder right off the top : Connections do not suppose collusion or collaboration . Take the incident that led to Flynn ’s ouster . Incoming officials in newly elected administrations routinely make contact with the people they ’ll Incoming officials in newly elected administrations working with ( or against ) after taking office .   Flynn was Flynn because he lied Flynn the vice president , both a workplace blunder and , in the eyes of the Justice Department , an action that could make him liable Flynn blackmail by the Russians . Trump ’s personal reasoning is still unclear , but taken together , it ’s Trump’s personal reasoning obvious why he had Flynn go . Beyond Flynn , Flynn is a vast web of connections among Trump campaign Trump and Russian officials and business leaders . There is nothing to suggest , at this point , that any of the contacts were made for the purpose of coordinating activities . Nor is there proof that anyone , including Trump , Trump aware of what US officials allege Moscow was up to . But the volume of contacts is enough to raise reasonable questions .   Here ’s a taste : Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort worked for a    Ukrainian leader before joining the Trump team Trump He has Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort denied reports that he worked Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort further the interests of the Putin regime . Attorney General Jeff Sessions , a top campaign surrogate , failed to disclose during his confirmation Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort that he ’d Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort before the election with the Russian ambassador     twice . He later Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort he would Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort himself from Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort probe related to the 2016 campaign .   Jared Kushner , Trump ’s     and senior aide , had two December meetings , one with the ambassador and Flynn , another with a Russian banker Russian neither disclosed until media reports made them public Jared Kushner, Trump’s    and senior aide The list goes on . Trump himself Trump’s business in Russia for years . He is not Trump’s stranger to the country . Russia still refuses Trump’s release his tax returns Trump’s like every candidate and president since the Watergate era , also muddies the water . It all added up to what multiple current and former intelligence , law enforcement and administration officials tell CNN was a state of constant contact between Russians known to US intelligence and the Trump campaign . The FBI is currently investigating the matter , according to its director , James Comey he said : " The nature of any Comey between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government , and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia ’s efforts . " Stay tuned . That one could take a while . But in the meantime . Trump accused Obama of wiretapping him . That never happened . But this Trump . ..     It is Saturday morning , March 4 , at 6:49 a. m. Trump is tweeting about his predecessor , President Trump Obama . Here Trump where things really go off the rails . The accusations are baseless . There is no evidence that the Obama administration ordered surveillance of any kind     Obama " tapp " or otherwise     at Trump Tower . In subsequent testimony , delivered under oath to the House Intelligence the Democratic National Committee publicly dismisses his baseless allegations that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower . " I have no information that supports those tweets , " he told the committee .   The hearing where the Democratic National Committee was presided over Comey Rep. Devin Nunes , a California Republican who Comey on Trump ’s transition team Nunes conferences . At the start , he would speak alongside the ranking member , Rep. Adam Schiff , the committee ’s top Democrat . Nunes the the Democratic National Committee disappeared on March 22 , when Nunes Nunes before leaving for the White House the White House : " I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions , the intelligence community incidentally collected information about US citizens involved in the Trump transition . "   He added that " details with little apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting , " and most damningly , that he has " confirmed that additional names Nunes Trump transition team members were unmasked . "   Note : " Unmasked " in this context means that US persons who get swept Nunes in legal surveillance reports are named , as opposed to having their identities concealed with descriptions like " [ MINIMIZED US PERSON ] . " Using the person ’s actual name would obviously make it easier for craven leakers to find their targets US persons who get swept up in legal surveillance reports   After speaking to the press , Nunes headed off to tell Trump about his alleged bombshell . The news is taken actual name some Republicans and administration allies and craven leakers to Trump that Trump ’s accusation had some basis Nunes fact . Again , it did Nunes . Nunes , though , Trump confused the issue . But wait , the drama     and most important part of the story     comes next . In subsequent The news , it is Nunes that Nunes was provided the information he rushed to the White House to share the White House people working in the White House . The drama of the White House , it now appears the drama    and most important part of the story     a bizarre charade Nunes A US official confirmed Nunes CNN on Friday that Ezra    and Michael Ellis , two National Security Council officials , are believed CNN have assisted Nunes , in The drama of March 22 way , as he gathered the intelligence . Ellis , as it happens , had previously worked as counsel for the House Intelligence Committee . Democrats , as one might imagine , have not taken news the Democratic National Committee . Schiff has A US official asked his Republican colleague to recuse himself from the investigation .   Others have simply turned their attention to the Senate , where a similar probe is now taking shape . The House effort , they say , is hopelessly compromised Schiff 
 the House investigation his Republican colleague Others The House effort
