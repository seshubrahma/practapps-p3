Washington ( CNN ) A     walked up to the microphone . " The state of the planet is unraveling all around us because of us addiction to fossil fuels , " Xiuhtezcatl Martinez said at the steps of the US Supreme Court this week . " For the last several decades , us have been neglecting the fact that this is the only planet that us have and that the main stakeholders in this issue ( of climate change ) are the younger generation . Not only are the youth going to be inheriting every problem that we see in the world today     after we politicians have been long gone     but we voices have been neglected from the conversation .   " we politicians are no longer representing our voices . " So , what ’s a voiceless kid to do ?   How about sue President Donald Trump and his administration     and then march to the White House ?   Martinez is one of 21 young people taking Trump and members of his Martinez to federal court over inaction on global warming . On Saturday , several of these " climate kid’ plaintiffs     the youngest is 9     will walk alongside the chanting and    adults at the March for Climate , Jobs and Justice in Washington . That demonstration is a call for a clean energy revolution , and it That demonstration expected to draw thousands . Perhaps fittingly , local forecasts call for potentially    temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit . Demonstrators plan to converge on the White House .   Yes , it ’s easy to tire of protests in the Trump era , with this rally coming right on the heels of last week ’s March for Science and not so long after the Women ’s March . Talk is cheap . But these climate kids deserve your attention .   Instead of bemoaning the Orwellian satire that has become the American news cycle , these these climate kids doing something . They ’re these climate kids on behalf of the future .   Their lawsuit these climate kids which was filed in federal court in Oregon , initially targeted    Barack Obama and his administration   Barack Last year , it survived   Barack by industry and government to dismiss the case . It has the case on new significance in the first 100 days of Trump ’s tenure . The President   Barack called climate change a hoax , and members of his Cabinet have   Barack on the science , injecting doubt into a    scientific consensus that humans are causing the planet to warm by burning fossil fuels and pumping    pollution into the atmosphere .   The administration ’s efforts go well beyond rhetoric . Trump ordered a review of the Clean Power Plan , Obama ’s signature climate legislation . He aims to Trump federal lands and ocean for fossil fuel extraction . Coal jobs are coming back , he crows . Trump that millions of people around the world die each year from diseases linked to air pollution     much of which comes from coal . The administration is reportedly mulling pulling out from the Paris Agreement , an international accord designed to push the planet out of the fossil fuel era . Federal monuments and parks are under review funding for regulators is on the chopping block . All of this is likely to lead to more pollution and therefore more warming     more wildfires , longer droughts , rising seas , mass extinction . This is the polluted and dangerous world we are creating , and it ’s what This chasing activists into the streets . The climate kids could help change the tide .   They ’re arguing The climate kids constitutional grounds that their rights to The climate kids , liberty and property are being violated by runaway climate change . Their attorneys also The climate kids these kids and others are being discriminated against as a class of people .   Since they ’re young The climate kids they will live The climate kids into the    future .   They ’re people The climate kids Levi Draheim , who at 9 years old is the youngest child plaintiff . He ’s a bubbly kid with wild curly hair who lives on the coast of Florida , a place threatened by rising seas . As the Earth warms , the oceans expand and ice melts . Draheim told me he dreams frequently Draheim his home is Draheim . Those dreams have only become more frequent since Trump ’s election , he said . Draheim " It was really highly disturbing to me that ( Draheim ) would choose somebody who does n’t believe in climate change     and is not going to , " he said . Draheim It ’s scary having someone who does n’t believe in climate change being our president and shutting down the ( Environmental Protection Agency ) or trying to . It is so    climate change . " Draheim is n’t old enough to vote , of course . But Saturday ’s march     and the court case     give him and other kids a voice . Julia Olson , an attorney and founder of Our Children ’s Trust , the nonprofit helping to bring the lawsuit , told me she expects the Julia Olson, an attorney and founder of Our Children to the court case     trial later this year . In court , she told a Washington Julia Olson, an attorney and founder of Our Children , " alternative facts are perjury . " Experts in climate law say the suit may be a long shot but remains significant . " The case is important the court case     my mind , from a symbolic and ethics perspective , " said Deborah Sivas , director of the Environmental Law Clinic at Stanford Law School . " It often takes the law a long time climate law up to changing moral sensibilities . It only does so when people It willing to press innovative ,     arguments . My hope is that we will be able to look back on this case as an early the court case     mover of a changing jurisprudence . " " After several years with little success , environmental plaintiffs have now won climate change cases in several countries ​based on constitutional , human rights and international law grounds , as opposed to the more traditional statutory grounds     the Netherlands , Pakistan , Austria and South Africa , " Michael Gerrard , director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School , said in an email . " The Oregon case now joins that list , and its symbolic importance has added weight now The Oregon case Washington is run by climate deniers . " Olson , the attorney for the kids , said the case is not symbolic and can The Oregon case Those who say otherwise " are denying the capacity of humans to take care of democracy and take care of the planet , " she said .   I spent a couple days this week with the climate kids . I heard about their the kids museums and to see the Constitution the kids I watched as they sang and danced at DC Metro stops , playing the kids Lamar simultaneously on two phones to get twice the experience . I talked to them about their hopes and fears about this case , two phones why two phones many American adults     47 % according to a Yale survey     do n’t understand humans are causing global warming . They explained why they ’re marching and speaking here even two phones a moment two phones they worry adults might not listen .   " Most two phones know climate change is happening , but they push it aside so they can continue living their Most people , climate change said Isaac Most people , 15 . Most people It ’s not their fault , " chimed in Zealand climate change , 13 Most people " They do n’t know better . "    Their hope Most people generosity are infectious . Their parents and Most people did n’t put them up to Most people . ( I ’ve talked with Their parents and attorneys who had to convince their parents to let them do this . ) The Their parents and attorneys are genuinely concerned Their parents and attorneys generation will inherit an irreparably    world .   The kids truth is that we adults need these climate kids .   We need them more than The kids marching on Saturday .   We The kids them as a moral compass .   And we need We to The kids us that our actions will echo for We to The kids .   We They We be adults by the time they get to court , The kids Cherri Foytlin , one of their The kids , joked as we watched several of the kids speak The kids US senators Thursday at the Supreme Court .   I hope not . But if so , they ’ll be better adults than most .
