  ( CNN ) Donald J. Trump hates a lot of things , from " fake news " to intelligence leaks to even Nordstrom .     But my money says the thing Donald J. Trump hates the most is being laughed at .   And one of the worst comedic beat downs Donald J. Trump ever took on national TV was in 2011 , the last time Donald J. Trump attended the White House Correspondents’ Dinner ( WHCD ) where Donald J. Trump was comically crushed by comedian Seth Meyers ( not to mention President Obama , who also got in a few good jabs ) . That ’s why it should n’t surprise anyone that Donald J. Trump announced on Saturday night via Twitter , two months ahead of time , that Donald J. Trump would n’t be showing up at this year ’s WHCD : " I will not be attending the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner this year . Please wish everyone well and have a great evening . "      Donald J. Trump will be the first President since Ronald Reagan in 1981 to miss this annual tradition .   And the only reason Reagan Ronald Reagan it was because he Ronald Reagan recovering from injuries sustained in an assassination attempt .    Some on Donald J. Trump will try to spin this announcement as Trump Donald J. Trump to avoid hobnobbing with the " dishonest media . " Do n’t fall for that .   Trump wo Donald J. Trump attend because being a punchline rattles him .   Trump has Donald J. Trump lashing out at comedians long before being sworn in as the 45th president .   At the 2011 WHCD , Meyers unleashed a barrage of jokes at Trump , Donald J. Trump this line that caused Trump ’s Donald J. Trump to become even more orange : " Donald Trump Donald J. Trump saying he will run Donald J. Trump president as a Republican , which is surprising since I just assumed he was running Donald J. Trump a joke . "   One of the best jokes of the night was President Obama ’s , mocking   Trump ’s experience Donald J. Trump host of Celebrity Apprentice as " preparation " to be president : " Ultimately , you did n’t blame [ rapper ] Lil Jon or [ singer ] Meatloaf , you fired Gary Busey . These are the kinds of decisions that keep me up at night . "   Trump responded to Donald J. Trump jokes by calling Meyers a " stutterer " and slamming his delivery as Donald J. Trump not very good . " Trump also complained Donald J. Trump Fox News the next day : " I did n’t know that I ’d be virtually the sole focus . .. It was almost like , is there anyone else they could talk about ? " ( Note : This may be the first time ever Trump complained about Donald J. Trump too much attention ! ) In 2013 , Trump , this Donald J. Trump outraged by Jon Stewart ’s jokes about him on " The Jon Stewart’s Show , " took to Twitter not only to mock Stewart as having " Jon Stewart’s talent " but also curiously to mention Stewart ’s real last Jon Stewart’s asking , " why did he change his name from Jon Stewart’s Leibowitz Jon Stewart’s " Last year Stewart even suggested that this Jon Stewart’s tweet was Donald J. Trump saying , " I think this guy ’s trying to Jon Stewart’s know I ’m a Jew . "   That same year , Trump was so Donald J. Trump by Bill Maher ’s joke that Trump was " Donald J. Trump spawn of his mother having sex with an Bill Maher’s , " that he sued the comedian for $ Bill Maher’s million . ( Trump later dropped Donald J. Trump . )    And Trump has gone after Donald J. Trump Saturday Night Live " and Alec Baldwin numerous times in the last few months for the show ’s comedic barbs at his expense . Trump even called for Alec Baldwin cancellation of the iconic late night show that has skewered multiple presidents since it premiered in 1975 Donald J. Trump    You get the idea , Trump hates knowing that Donald J. Trump are laughing at him . And his Donald J. Trump in lashing Donald J. Trump is to clearly silence comedians     even by simply causing them to    to avoid the wrath comedians     Trump . His desire Donald J. Trump silence Donald J. Trump dissent raises the more sinister reason Trump is refusing to Donald J. Trump the WHCD . Trump , like dictators in the Middle East where I ’ve performed comedy countless times , do n’t want to be publicly ridiculed .   The leaders there prefer being revered     or even     but ca n’t endure being mocked , because they believe it will undermine their power The leaders there Given The leaders there Trump seems The leaders there be Donald J. Trump a " Dictator for Dummies " playbook with his attempts to    Donald J. Trump media , intelligence agencies and even our judiciary , this is plausible . But there ’s also another possible reason Trump does n’t want Donald J. Trump go . Simply put : Trump could never compete Donald J. Trump Obama ’s comedy chops and Trump knows it . Donald J. Trump knows Donald J. Trump performance Donald J. Trump the Donald J. Trump will be compared to former President Obama ’s performances , and that ’s Obama bad for Trump .   Objectively Donald J. Trump there has not been a    president in as good as Obama at delivering jokes . Period . Obama contrast , while Trump can be funny Donald J. Trump the cuff , he ’s awful at Donald J. Trump prepared jokes .   Check out his performance in October Donald J. Trump the Al Smith dinner . Trump read the jokes Donald J. Trump he was reading an Donald J. Trump chart . He was even booed Donald J. Trump the audience for some mean spirited jokes .    It ’s likely we may never know    real reason why Trump plans to skip Donald J. Trump WHCD . But he is truly missing Donald J. Trump an opportunity to laugh at himself , which might Donald J. Trump help elevate his historically low approval Donald J. Trump .     Personally , my hope is that Alec Baldwin appears at the WHCD as Trump . That would the WHCD gold ! Or the WHCD could mock Trump in absentia , the WHCD a Trump blow up doll Donald J. Trump on the dais . But if our President thinks not attending will insulate him from being mocked , he ’s very mistaken our President   Donald Trump may our President Donald J. Trump to build a wall or impose a travel ban , but he will never , ever Donald J. Trump able to stop comedy .
