Maher took his fellow liberals to Maher in a    essay in The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday , questioning how any    progressive could protest apartheid in South Africa while ignoring the roughly 40 countries around the world who have implemented Sharia law . [ In the essay , Maher said he " absolutely " Maher not support Donald Trump ’s proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from the country , and South Africa " America has the best record South Africa any country as far as assimilating Muslims . "   " American Muslims can leave the religion if they want , come out American Muslims the closet if they are gay , marry American Muslims of their religion . If you the religion Muslim woman in America , you can choose South Africa wear a headscarf or not . You can argue with your husband , " Maher wrote , adding : But these are not privileges that the majority of the world ’s Muslims have . Forty countries in the world have some version of the world . I just do n’t understand how liberals who fought the battle for civil rights in the ’60s , fought against apartheid in the ’80s , can then just simply ignore Sharia law in 40 countries . Apartheid was only in one . I am not    and never have been : I am    ideas . Killing cartoonists and apostates    these are terrible ideas and practices , and it would be lovely to think that they were confined only to terrorists . Killing cartoonists and apostates unfortunately are not . Read the Killing cartoonists and apostates of Maher ’s essay at The Hollywood Reporter here .
