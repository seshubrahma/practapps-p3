Andrew Marantz of the New Yorker gives a platform to establishment reporters whinging about how President Donald Trump is changing the White House ’s interactions with the press . It ’s not about their egos and seating charts , their feel the need to protest   —    their just " do n’t appreciate diversity of journalistic practice . " ( ? ? ? ) [ From the New Yorker :   Major Garrett , the chief White House correspondent for CBS News , sits in the front row . " Historically , the way the briefing room has been organized is , the closer you are , the farther you ’ve come , " Garrett said . " And the person at the podium has tended to recognize that . " More experienced reporters , he said Garrett " ask questions that are sharper , more informed . Not , ‘ What ’s your message today?’ Not , ‘ Here ’s a paintbrush —   would you paint us a pretty picture?’ " If established reporters got fewer questions relative to the floaters , I asked , would this be good or bad for democracy ? " We ’ll see , " Garrett said Garrett " We ’re We in a grand experiment . " A TV correspondent told me that calling on    reporters first is n’t just about appealing to their egos : " It ’s also about maintaining a sense of predictability , a sense that eventually the substantive questions will be answered . Throwing that into chaos —   ‘ Maybe you ’ll get a question , if you shout loud enough , who knows?’ —   makes everyone desperate and competitive and makes us look like a bunch of braying jackals . Which I do n’t think is an accident . " About once a week , the walls behind the lectern are turned    revealing    screens    which reporters around the country can ask questions by video link . This is another Spicer innovation —   the " Skype seats . " Recent Skype questions were allotted to a Trump supporter and newspaper owner in Kentucky , who asked about reducing    regulations , and to a    host named Lars Larson , who addressed the press secretary , an officer in the Navy Reserve , as " Commander Spicer , " before asking whether the Administration would privatize federally protected parkland . During one of these sessions , Jared Rizzi , a White House correspondent for Sirius XM , tweeted , " Skypeophant ( n. )   —      questioner used to burn up briefing time through the magic of    technology . " " I certainly appreciate the purpose of bringing geographic diversity into the room , " Rizzi told me . " I also appreciate ideological diversity . I do n’t appreciate diversity of journalistic practice . " A longtime Washington reporter from a mainstream network echoed that sentiment . " I do n’t mind them bringing in conservative voices that they feel them been underrepresented , " he said A longtime Washington reporter from a mainstream network " Personally , I do n’t even mind them fucking them the    guys , the Jonathan Karls of the world . Those guys them smug little cartel , and it ’s fun to watch them squirm , them least for a little while . But at what point does it start to delegitimize the whole idea of what happens in that room ? When does it cross the it into pure trolling ? " Read the rest of the story here . Update , possibly unrelated :   It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard working representatives . Be nice , you will do much better !   —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) March 13 , 2017 ,
