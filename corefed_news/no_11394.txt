Professor John Banzhaf of George Washington University appeared on Tuesday ’s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon to discuss presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s proposed temporary ban on Muslim immigration   —    a proposal Banzhaf analyzed and found to be consistent with the U. S. Constitution . [ Professor John Banzhaf of George Washington University said Professor John Banzhaf of George Washington University analysis is " consistent with that of most people who know constitutional law . "   " What ’s happening is , people are overreacting . people hear the word ‘ profiling.’ Profiling is automatically wrong Profiling ’s unconstitutional . In many cases , racial profiling or nationalistic profiling is illegal , " he said .   " But in the case of preventing terrorism , or border crossings , the Supreme Court has said that profiling , properly done , can be constitutional if the Supreme Court meets two requirements , " Banzhaf stated , adding : Number one is , the Supreme Court is used to deal with an important governmental problem , which terrorism obviously is . Secondly , if it is only one of several factors . That , by the way , is how we have racial discrimination in terms of admitting people to we colleges . we call it " affirmative action . " it is racial profiling , which is permitted because it is only one of several factors . Banzhaf blamed sensationalistic media coverage for creating an environment in which " people are not thinking logically . " " people react to labels . Profiling : bad . Racial profiling : even worse , " he said . " It ’s also been said to be ‘ ’ yet It turns out Governor Jeb Bush , U. S. Senator Ted Cruz , Representative Peter King , even Hillary Clinton Governor Jeb Bush, U. S. Senator Ted Cruz, Representative Peter King, even Hillary Clinton said , yes , in certain instances , we have to do profiling . " he continued by saying , " Not too long ago , Barack Obama and one of we leading senators both said New York Police Department ’s Ray Kelly would make a great secretary of Homeland Security , yet he ’s very    for concentrating       in the Muslim community . " " So it ’s hard to say it it   . It it certainly not unconstitutional , in terms of bringing people into the country we ’ve had a history of it , " Banzhaf recalled , citing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the 1924 Immigration Act . To illustrate the absurdity of a security system without any " profiling " at all , Banzhaf Banzhaf to the Transportation Security Agency , which assumes that the " risk posed by an elderly Asian female , for example , is exactly equal to that posed by a young Arabic or Muslim male . " " It obviously is not . We should be concentrating our We in areas where we ’re more likely to find terrorists   —    rather than , out of excessive P. C. treating everybody exactly equal , " he excessive P. C. .   " That ’s what we We in other areas , " Banzhaf observed , and added : You know , men sometimes get breast cancer . Young women get breast cancer . But when we We for breast breast cancer we look in older women . If we ’re looking for    disease , we look for it in disease immigrants . If we ’re concerned about finding    anemia , we concentrate we blacks . It ’s only common sense . The whole mathematics which has developed around this , we ’re totally ignoring it .
