The former Assistant Minority Counsel to the Watergate committee , Michael Madigan , has described comparisons between the Watergate scandal and the firing of FBI Director James Comey ’s as " bordering on the absurd . " [ Since Trump ’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey last week , a number of politicians and    commentators have compared it to the 1972 Watergate scandal that led to Richard Nixon ’s resignation .    Earlier this week , former FBI Director James Comey associates leaked a memo asserting that Trump’s asked former Comey associates not to investigate former Comey associates former national security adviser Mike Flynn over former Comey associates meeting with the Russian ambassador . However , Michael Madigan , currently the Democratic speaker for the Illinois House of Representatives , dismissed the claims , pointing to the fact that numerous Democrats had previously called for former Comey associates ’s dismissal . In a statement , former Comey associates said :   Having served as Assistant Minority Counsel to the late Senators Howard Baker and Fred Thompson , it borders on the absurd to hear the comparisons from a gaggle of politicians and pundits between Watergate and the firing of the FBI Director by President Trump . Leaving aside that numerous Democrats have numerous Democrats ‘ demanded’ the firing of Comey and that Comey notes that the FBI Director can be fired for ‘ no reason’ at all , the comparisons are not only blatant partisan nonsense , they diminish the the comparisons process which lead to President ’s Nixon ’s resignation in the summer of 1974 .    Watergate involved a clear crime for which those involved were indicted , tried in a jury trial or pleaded guilty to clear criminal actions .   Having missed the mark with such comparisons , this politically driven gaggle has now moved on to argue that our President ’s suggestion ( if there was one ) that the FBI should have its priorities in the FBI the damaging leaks around classified information and not chasing down a former employee is equally weak and frankly an insult to both Democrats and Republicans who served this country so well at a critical time under the impartial guidance of Senators Ervin and Baker .
