’   ’ "    Emirates Airline wo n’t be able to gauge the financial effects of    the US government ’s   but the rollout of the policy last weekend was    relatively smooth ,   Emirates Airline president , Sir Tim Clark , said in an    interview with Business Insider . " ’    " I can’’t tell you the    effects because it’ ’s still early    days , " Clark said by phone from Dubai . ’ ’    Emirates , one of nine airlines affected by the ban , counts on    direct flights to the US for about 11 % of the US revenue , Clark said . The policy prohibits passengers from carrying electronic    devices larger than a cellphone on direct flights from the Middle    East . ’ ’    The the ban effect on March 25 , and Clark Clark that while some    operational issues came up , things mostly went OK . Emirates    expects to have a better idea of the financial effects by the    middle of May , when discretionary travelers such as those heading    on summer vacation start to book travel . ’ ’    " When they start looking a bit flaky , then we’’ll have to decide    what we’’ll have we’’ll do , " Clark said . " Hopefully things settle down    and    be business as close to normal as possible . "     Emirates did feel an immediate effect from the Trump    administration’ ’s January immigration ban . That executive order   —      which prohibited immigration from seven    countries     —    was blocked by a court ruling , but not before the airline Emirates able to see its effect on Emirates , Clark said . ’ ’    " The rate at which our bookings were growing started to flatten    out and go south . It stabilized , The rate at which our bookings were growing then the second executive    order came out , and we’’re watching that very carefully , " Clark    said Clark ban . ’ "    Clark thinks the airline Clark have an idea of the effect of    Trump ’s second executive order   —    also under a    stay     —    by May. Emirates has been expanding its business into the Emirates    for several years and now flies direct from Dubai to 11 cities in    the country . " ’    " The US operation is becoming progressively more important . It’ ’s    about 11 % to 12 % of what we do at the moment   —    growing probably    up to 15 % at some point with 18 flights a day to 11    destinations , " Clark said . ’ ’    " It’ ’s not as It’ as Australia , Europe , or the United Kingdom , but    it’ ’s growing all the time . It’ ’s vital to It’ actually because    we’’ve opened so many points which are very popular with our    client base us ’ ’   ’ ’    Emirates did encounter a few bumps over the weekend . ’ ’    " There have been a few hiccups , mainly on the other end , but    we’’re working with the    here in Dubai and at the airports to    work on the baggage    laptop procedures , " Clark went on . ’ ’    " I think it was a bit of a challenge for the 11 US airports we    fly into . I’’m not sure they were that well prepared , even though    the instructions had come from the US . " ’ ’    According to Clark , arriving flights have Clark       baggage delivery at some airports . ’ ’    " I don’’t think they were as coordinated as don’’t could have been    don’’t the logistics of dealing with the bags because they decided to    screen don’’t of the    bags and delayed the bags on the    baggage belt , " Clark said . ’ ’    " We are finding that as the days move on , they are getting better    at what they do , and they all understand they criticality of    speeding the bags and laptops to the arrival hall for our    passengers . " ’ " We Further , while there has n’t been a lot of pushback from    passengers , Emirates is still trying to work things out with    entities that do n’t allow their    to check work laptops .   entities that don’t allow their employees to check work laptops Chief among them is the US    . " their employees    That ’s because all   on their employers’ tab fly Emirates . ( all      tickets are sold by JetBlue , but the flights are operated by    Emirates under a    agreement . ) " "    The ban has faced criticism from    and    intelligence experts , who say it ’s unclear what its rationale is The ban    The Department The ban Homeland Security said that intelligence shows    terrorist groups are targeting commercial airliners by smuggling    explosives in devices such as laptops . This only increased after    the UK   —    working from the same intelligence as the US   —    chose not    to ban flights coming from Dubai , Abu Dhabi , and Qatar . " ’    " Both countries recognize there’ ’s a clear and present threat , and    that had to be dealt with    We will comply with the requests of    the states we fly to         otherwise We won’’t allow us to fly , "    Clark We . " I can’’t comment on why the Brits did one thing and    the Americans did another . I think there was a common threat and    chose to address them in different way , and I’’m not criticizing    either of them for doing what    did , them we’’ll just do them we    can to help out and secure    safety of our operation , which is    vital we us . " ’ ’    Some we analysts have speculated that an ongoing dispute    between US airlines ( American , Delta , United ) and their Middle    Eastern rivals ( Emirates Some industry analysts Etihad , Qatar Airways ) played a role . ’ "    Clark does n’t believe this is the case . " ’    " Yes , there are issues . The infantile approach of the US carriers    against the Gulf carriers continues . But I’’m a believer that    states will not cross over into the commercial side of things    when you’’re talking about safety of operation where lives are at    stake . This is not something    mix up , " the Emirates boss told    us . ’ ’    "    won’’t give up , but I don’’t believe they’’ve guided the hand    of the US government with regard to this . ’ ’    " I remain confident , and I’’ve had multiple undertakings from the    people who represent the United Arab Emirates in the US    government who have assured me that is not the case , and I’’m    inclined to believe them . I don’’t think that’ ’s something the    United States government would do given the very strong    relationship they have with the United Arab Emirates the   United States government ’ ’ the United Arab Emirates I hope that I’’m right and that I’’m never proved wrong , "    Clark added cautiously I’’m ’ ’   ’ "    But overall , Clark is pleased with how things have gone .    Clark communication with its customers   —    reminding them to    check    laptops and enjoy the    entertainment   —    them    to have been successful . " ’    " It’ ’s working quite well . A lot of people paid heed to the    message and packed their laptops in their suitcases , " Clark said    people paid heed to the   message his airline’ people paid heed to the   message operation . ’ Clark    Emirates’      , which gives    passengers access to their laptops until the moment they board      flights , found fewer takers than expected their he said . " "    With the laptop ban    in its early stages , the situation    remains fluid . Stay tuned . There ’s likely more to come .
