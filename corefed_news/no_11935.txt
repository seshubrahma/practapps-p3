The conservative group Club for Growth has booked $ 1 . 5 million in advertising in the upcoming Indiana primary . The ad explicitly urges voters to support Sen. Ted Cruz as a means of blocking Donald Trump from winning the Republican nomination . [ " If you do n’t want Donald Trump to win , your choice comes down to this : math , " the ad states . " Sen. Ted Cruz can beat Donald Trump . Donald Trump ca n’t do it . The math wo n’t work . "   " Indiana is facing a unique moment in history : the opportunity to stop Donald Trump , " Donald Trump , President of Club for Growth Action , said . " After success with our ads in Wisconsin , Iowa , Oklahoma , and Utah , CFG Action is about to blanket the Hoosier State with a simple message : To stop Trump , vote Cruz . There is now no state more important than Indiana for electing Cruz and keeping Trump from reaching 1 , Trump . " Before he became President of Club McIntosh Growth , McIntosh was a Congressman from Indiana . With the ad Indiana the Club is clearly trying to replay the campaign tactics that delivered a lopsided win in the Wisconsin primary for Ted Cruz . While the Cruz of polls showed Cruz leading in the Badger State Cruz four points , he won the state by more than 13 the Badger State The big margin allowed Cruz to secure 36 of the Cruz ’s 42 delegates . The big difference between the polls in Wisconsin and the final results is Wisconsin a lot of support for Kasich moved to Cruz at the very end . Cruz was polling around 20 percent support Kasich the poll average , but ended up with just 14 percent of the vote . That vote shifted to Cruz at the the vote of Cruz campaign . Indiana is emerging as one of the most important states remaining on the primary calendar for groups opposed to Donald Trump . After Trump ’s landslide win in New York , Donald Trump frontrunner is expected to rack up a series of wins next week when five Northeastern states go to the polls . The primary calendar then moves back to the Midwest and Western States , where Ted Cruz has run competitively against Trump . Similar to Wisconsin , Indiana is the Donald Trump state voting on May 3rd . It is the only contest on the calendar between the primaries of April 26th and May 10th . With a     prize of 57 delegates , Indiana offers a critical lifeline for the Cruz campaign Indiana its strategy of blocking Trump from Ted Cruz the 1 Indiana 237 minimum he needs to secure a majority of pledged delegates Trump It Trump were to win Indiana , he would have Trump high probability of Indiana enough Trump to win the GOP nomination on the first ballot . Groups opposed to Trump ’s candidacy , like the Club , are Trump Indiana to blunt the frontrunner ’s momentum going into Indiana final primary states . As it stands now , Trump needs to win just under 60 percent of the Trump pledged delegates to secure the nomination . That challenge is higher if Trump were the GOP nomination on the first ballot Indiana . The most recent poll Trump Indiana shows Indiana very tight race between Trump and Indiana . The toplines of the poll show Trump 37 percent against 31 percent for Cruz The most recent poll of Indiana Trump of the poll , however , show the race Cruz be essentially tied between The most recent poll of Indiana . Ohio Gov. John Kasich a very tight race between Trump and Cruz pulling 22 percent support from Indiana Republicans . To replicate his win in Wisconsin Indiana Cruz needs to capture a large share of the vote Ohio Gov. John Kasich behind Kasich . The Cruz by Club for Growth is overtly making that appeal . The Ohio Gov. John Kasich in Indiana is critical . If Trump wins the state Indiana it is very likely he will Indiana in the remaining states and secure the necessary Trump wins the state of delegates to Trump wins the state the nomination outright . If , however , Cruz can capture the state , the primary will remain intensely competitive through Indiana , the Cruz day of voting . A The primary in Indiana Indiana would also make it unlikely that Trump can win the Indiana , 237 delegates he needs to secure the nomination before A loss in Indiana RNC convention Trump July . The result could set in Trump a scramble for delegates that will play out through the remaining months and the floor of the convention in Cleveland . It is perhaps fitting that the GOP nomination comes down to a jump the RNC convention in July
