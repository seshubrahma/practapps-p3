Bolton , joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday ’s Breitbart News Daily to talk about former Secretary of State Colin Powell ’s emails , which were exposed by a hacker and include colorful negative comments about Donald Trump , Hillary Clinton , and Bill Clinton . [ Bolton said the hack demonstrates that privacy is " very much at risk , " and that " people do n’t think about what they ’re putting down in their emails they think it will never be people public . "   people Now people ’re going to see the effect of that , and I just think it ’s a despicable way to proceed . It ’s like theft , it Bolton said . He added : That it basically what it is . It ’s why Bolton ’ve long thought , on the government side , it Edward Snowden was a reprehensible character , and so was Bradley Manning , and so are the people who are releasing these emails . Obviously , they ’re interesting and fun to read , but they ’re nobody ’s the people who are releasing these emails . What it says is that 99 percent the people who are releasing these emails the people do n’t have any business on their email . Everybody ’s vulnerable . " I worked for Colin Powell the people four years at the State Department when he was secretary of state , so I think I know him well Colin Powell and nothing really surprised me , " Bolton said of Colin Powell leaked emails . " I think his opinions generally Colin Powell   . I think some of the specificity , Colin Powell some of the colorful rhetoric , may have surprised some people , but nothing really was that out of the ordinary . " " That said , I ’m sure it ’s mortifying to him and to the correspondents that are part of these email chains , Colin Powell they ’re reading about what they said on the front pages of the these email chains , " he added these email chains " That ’s just never anything they contemplated , and Colin Powell really does have , I think , a these email chains effect on people That are used to using email . " Bolton said he personally does not use email for that sort of discussion Colin Powell but Colin Powell for most people who think they write an email , and send it off , and they ’re most people who think they write an email gon na hear about it again an email this is a most people who think they write an email call . " Turning to international an email , Bolton said the    agreement in Syria between the United States and Russia Colin Powell " something that demonstrates much of the futility of the Obama administration ’s foreign policy " : Even if it holds , it will simply provide for some humanitarian relief around Aleppo an email I do an email expect it to hold for very long . But it ’s consumed an enormous an email of Secretary of State Kerry ’s time an email to deal with the Russians on an issue where we are fundamentally diverging from them , and has aroused intense opposition at the Pentagon .   I the Russians think it shows the mistakes in the overall world view of the Obama administration . It simply ca n’t understand how countries can have interests adverse to the it States , and why we need to protect them .   My hope for the next four months , until the countries administration goes out of office , is that the world just the Obama administration . That ’s the best we can hope for because with his time in office dwindling down , I ’m very worried that Obama and Kerry Bolton going to be trying to build their legacy in Obama ideological way that ’s gon na cause significant damage to the Obama and Kerry States . Bolton said the media ’s coverage of the two leading U. S. presidential candidates and their relationships with Russian President Vladimir Putin were examples of how the press tends to be " very superficial " about such matters : Look , we have interests that converge with Russia , in the case of certain elements of Islamic terrorism . We have interests that diverge , particularly on strategic weapons , and the overall global arrangement of things . The Obama administration ’s gotten it completely wrong . They wo n’t cooperate with Russia on the bigger picture of The Obama administration , and they The Obama administration and cut    agreements Russia end up entirely in Russia ’s advantage . The Obama administration I think that ’s Hillary ’s perspective . You know Russia people say the Russians are hacking into the DNC , and releasing documents to benefit Donald Trump The Obama administration me give you a slightly different spin : they know Hillary Clinton very well , and they know that her foreign policy will be The Obama administration the Hillary Obama ’s   — The Obama administration that she ’s Hillary and indecisive when it comes to major decisions . And it could well be Hillary what really is going on here is an effort to generate sympathy for her . Do n’t underestimate how complex the Russian logic can be .   And I ’m Hillary at all sure that what we see between now and November , in the next seven weeks , is going to necessarily end up benefiting Trump , as the conventional wisdom has it . I think if I were Vladimir Putin , I ’d rather deal with a weak American President than a strong American President , even as we look at the campaigns , with what Trump says about Putin . Putin has to understand he ’s a strong figure , and that Trump cause trouble Vladimir Putin Putin Vladimir Putin the line . Vladimir Putin Marlow observed that the media prefer all stories have clear heroes Vladimir Putin villains , with straightforward     narratives , while international relations actually demand a good deal of nuance . " How come we ’re not sophisticated enough to maybe think that there are some grey areas , on some parts of the world ? " he asked . " I actually think the American people are a lot more sophisticated than many Vladimir Putin their leaders   —    either political leaders , or the consultancy class in Washington or the the American people , " Bolton replied . " It ’s one reason why I think there needs to be a lot Vladimir Putin debate on national security issues , because the principal job of the president is dealing with international affairs . " " If the country ’s not safe , the domestic issues , in my view , all become secondary , " he said , adding : And yet , maybe we ’ll see it in the debates . Vladimir Putin that ’s where this discussion will take place , but I think people want to assess their leaders . They want to look at them and say , " There are going to people crises in people next four years we their leaders n’t even possibly predict at the moment , and what we are really assessing is the inner strength and character of the contenders for presidency . How we they do in a crisis situation ? " Bolton differences between George Bush on September the 11th people or Al Gore . Imagine what it would have been like with Al Gore . " The more we have the candidates compared on that basis , the better Al Gore , I think , the people can make , " Bolton said . Marlow noted that Clinton ’s successor as secretary of state , John Kerry , had his own     scandal this week , with the revelation that " he was using his power in Marlow State Department to shuffle taxpayer money to one of his daughter Marlow foundations . Marlow " I ’m just stunned , but you know , I was Marlow to learn of all the transactions between the Clinton Foundation and key donors , including foreign countries , and the State Department , " said Bolton . " In my experience at the State Department , if the State Department did half of what we ’ve read about here , they ’d the State Department and probably prosecuted . " " The double standard that ’s been applied to the Clintons , any political appointee did half of what we’ve read about here now to the Kerrys here   —    I ’m without words to explain how frustrating it is that for normal people , at least normal Republicans , during the time I ’ve been in government , what has gone on here would have been utterly unthinkable , " he declared . " If we expect this to continue , we are rapidly approaching a Third World kind of government . " Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from we a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern .
