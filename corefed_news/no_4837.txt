DETROIT , Michigan   —    President Trump ’s base appears to be growing concerned with the direction of ’s base administration , against the backdrop of a number of drastic policy shifts from the campaign period as well as ’s base first few weeks in office . [ As the notorious " first 100 days " mark rushes up on ’s base , President Trump will have to perform a careful balancing act between the two evident camps in the White House : the nationalists and the globalists , between which a real reconciliation looks unlikely .   The former appears to be supported by the campaign ’s base   —    the people who put President Trump in office . The latter appears to appeal to President Trump on the grounds of more positive headlines , less contentious policy issues as far as establishment media coverage is concerned , and his President Trump , New York liberal outlook . It ’s not all bad news for the President Trump but it is It warning to be heeded . Here in Michigan , Trump voters President Trump campaigners , and    donors expressed concern to this Breitbart News correspondent on the recent change in his direction this Breitbart News correspondent —    citing the travel ban , border control , and the power of his relatives this Breitbart News correspondent his administration this Breitbart News correspondent key areas of concern . " We ’re watching a man who can take action every single day , " Jeff , a    Trump supporter , told me . He went this Breitbart News correspondent : He does this Breitbart News correspondent need to go to Congress . He can this Breitbart News correspondent action . We ’re watching him carefully this Breitbart News correspondent We ’re We about people who have lives to live . Grandchildren to take care of . And we ’re We actions day to day and they ’re falling flat . They ’re they from why we put the man there , and it is extremely , it is more than stressful . We ’re we track , we ’re we it . track do we want to hear about family members having an impact . We voted we We have we expectations for impact . Not everyone was so glum , however . One local cab driver dismissed such concerns , telling me that President Trump would listen to whomever he had One local cab driver on a variety of issues , and if they tried whomever " bounce him " One local cab driver much , he ’d One local cab driver back , perhaps even stop listening . I asked him , One local cab driver his sunny One local cab driver on the issue , " Do you think the border wall will be built ? " He shot One local cab driver a wry smile in his rear One local cab driver mirror : " No . But I do n’t think it matters . " " I might take a permanent break [ from Trump ] ! " said Cindy , a local Republican Party activists who admits to having preferred Sen. Ted Cruz in the primaries . " Oh no you ’re not ! " her friend shot back . They laughed Cindy, a local Republican Party activists who admits to having preferred Sen. Ted Cruz in the primaries about her irritation her but she continued her : " I look every day to see if he put that [ travel ] ban on . I look every day , " she said her insisting that the White House had not done enough to force through President Trump ’s executive order pausing the flow of refugees and calling for extreme vetting . Some even stated they ’d Some hard to win back , even though it ’s been fewer than 100 days for President Trump President Trump’s Perhaps , I thought , their frustration emanates from Some fact that candidate Trump promised so President Trump’s " day one . " His blunt approach during the President Trump’s perhaps lulled supporters into thinking these were literal " day one " promises . He had said during the President Trump’s that " day the campaign would include imposing Congressional term limits , repealing Obamacare , deporting illegal immigrants , fixing Veteran ’s Affairs , redressing the balance of NATO , getting rid of gun free zones in schools , and a whole lot more . Although President Trump swiftly acted on some issues such as " ending the war on coal " and appears to be moving toward a renegotiation of NAFTA , on others , he has performed a complete    President Trump , evidenced this week by his chumminess with NATO ’s Secretary President Trump , and a    on replacing Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen and his prior disdain for the    President Trump . He relied heavily on these issues President Trump his campaign videos , especially the President Trump targeted at The Great Lakes State in the final few weeks of the 2016 campaign : While these names were not first to the lips of the dozens I spoke to in Michigan   —    which I am not claiming is science   —    they did stress their growing disaffection these names were not first to the lips of the dozens I spoke to in Michigan  —   which I am not claiming the executive these names were not first to the lips of the dozens I spoke to in Michigan  —   which I am not claiming . " I feel like it ’s gone so far now the wrong way that it ’s going to take something it on his part to get people back . We ’re fish that are off the hook right now . He only has one small chance his get us hooked again , " Penny We a    lady from Sterling Heights , told me , adding : Jared and Ivanka were not on the ballot . I did not vote for them , nor would I if Jared and Ivanka the opportunity . There is a reason we have    rules . The fact that they were aided by the odious Jamie Gorelick in circumventing those rules pours salt in our wounds . Now it looks like the counterbalance of Bannon and Kellyanne is being marginalized . President Trump seems to have forgotten the loyal supporters who have been behind him since the early primary days President Trump I feel so very betrayed . And being in Detroit , a common theme was Islam and Muslim immigration . All bar one person I spoke to on the matter agreed that the Muslim Brotherhood should be designated as a terrorist organisation , and that refugee resettlement into the United States needs immediate curtailment . With what I gathered in Dearborn and Hamtramck   —    as research for my upcoming book   —    I was hardly surprised . " There is at least 50 people I know that are disappointed that the Hijra to America is continuing , " Cindy said , concluding : " Lay off the Freedom Caucus we are the grassroots supporters . " The writing is obviously not yet on the wall as far as a second Trump term goes . But if the first 100 days   —    especially the second half of that time period   —    are anything to go by   —    the Donald will have some serious explaining to do in about three years time .
