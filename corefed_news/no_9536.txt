[ " We need change , " Republican Congressman Thomas Massie explained . " If it came to that , I would do it . "   " In just a few days [ November 15th ] there ’ll be the nomination , and the constitutional election will happen on January 3rd . Presently Paul Ryan does not have my vote , " Republican Congressman Thomas Massie said in a podcast with Reason ’s Nick Gillespie . When ’s Nick Gillespie pressed ’s Nick Gillespie on whether ’s Nick Gillespie would run to fill Paul Ryan Paul Ryan job himself , Republican Congressman Thomas Massie said : " Somebody has to . I ’m not saying I will do it , but we need change . I would rather give my vote to somebody who will support the platform [ that upholds regular order ] but if it came to that , I would do it it came to that " The nation is facing " a constitutional crisis   …      thanks to Paul Paul Ryan " Republican Congressman Thomas Massie explained : The next Speaker needs to let Congress debate whether we should be involved in all these military conflicts . We ’ve got a constitutional crisis right now thanks to John Boehner and thanks to Paul Ryan Paul Ryan we ’re involved We military conflicts around the globe that have not been authorized by Congress , and Congress are not short term conflicts . While Republican Congressman Thomas Massie noted that Republican Congressman Thomas Massie own opposition to Ryan ’s Speakership Paul Ryan largely from procedural issues rather than specific policies , other conservative lawmakers have expressed concern that Ryan ’s policy Paul Ryan , as well as his demonstrations of Paul Ryan leadership throughout the election season , have made him unfit to Paul Ryan the Republican party in Congress . In particular , some lawmakers have pointed to Ryan ’s efforts Paul Ryan undermine Trump ’s campaign . Last month , Congressman Mark Meadows said that a lot of conservatives " question the loyalty of the Speaker " in light of Ryan ’s treatment of Paul Ryan said that the Trump’s to remove Ryan as Speaker was " Paul Ryan up some steam . " Moreover , on particular policies , while Ryan himself has acknowledged that Paul Ryan " earned a mandate Trump’s from the American people , Trump was given a " mandate Trump’s to enact policies that stand in direct opposition to Ryan ’s personal agenda on pivotal Paul Ryan trade , immigration , and crime . For instance , Trump ran on a platform of immigration Trump’s , whereas Ryan has been an active champion of Paul Ryan borders . According to Pew polling data , 92 percent of the GOP electorate oppose Ryan ’s vision for expanding immigration levels Paul Ryan want to see immigration levels frozen or reduced . Similarly , Trump ran against globalist trade policies , whereas Trump’s supports the multinational trade policies backed by Paul Ryan Republican Party ’s donor class . Ryan even worked as President Obama ’s " Paul Ryan " to fast track the    Partnership agreement . According to polling data from a recent POLITICO    survey , 85 percent of GOP voters disagree with Speaker Ryan ’s vision on the issue of Paul Ryan believe that    " free trade " has lost the U. S. more jobs than it has created . Massie told Gillespie that , the U. S. he was not initially a Trump supporter , he Massie decided to get on the Trump train Massie after he became the party ’s nominee . " Trump Massie have been the only one [ of Trump 17 Republican candidates ] on that stage who could win Pennsylvania and Michigan while not losing Florida . And it ’s got some interesting ramifications for the Republican party , " Massie said . Trump ’s victory " represents an implosion of the Trump and maybe a realignment . " Massie the Republican party has been a religion in the Republican Party Massie it ’s called free trade and if you the Republican party question some of a religion in the Republican Party trade deals you immediately got branded as a protectionist   …      there ’s always sort of been this     " you ’re a protectionist " if you start talking about the rules of trade   …      [ But ] Trump captured Pennsylvania , and Michigan and Ohio —   the Rust Belt , if you will —   by talking about this issue and challenging some of those assumptions . Indeed , by running against Speaker Ryan ’s agenda on trade , immigration , and crime , Trump was not only able to win the presidential election ( which Ryan was Trump to do when he was on the GOP ticket ) but Speaker Ryan was also able to win Trump ’s home state of Wisconsin ( which Trump was also unable to do Speaker Ryan he was on the GOP ticket ) Speaker Ryan Trump now " has a mandate Trump " Massie the GOP ticket    particularly Trump the issue of immigration and building a wall along the southern border . Massie explained that if Congress were to get in Trump ’s way on this issue , Massie believes " the next stage will Trump pitchforks and torches in Washington the issue of immigration I Massie there are a couple things that Trump has to do and if he does n’t do these things , or Trump Congress gets in the way of him Massie these things , the a couple things that Trump has to do will be pitchforks Congress torches in Washington D. Massie One of those things is the next stage Obamacare   …      The other thing I think   …      is I a couple things that Trump has to do ’s got to start building a wall . He ’s got a mandate there   Massie      he said he was going to build Massie wall , he got elected with over 300 Massie votes Massie I think it ’s going to start Massie or else some people are going to be very upset . In recent days , Ryan has ducked answering questions about whether he will now champion Trump ’s proposed border wall along the southern border . Ryan has also not said whether , Ryan light of Trump ’s " mandate , " he now recants his former Ryan denouncing Trump ’s plan to enforce immigration law and allow ICE officers to do their Ryan by removing Ryan in the country Trump . " I was not surprised [ when Trump won ] , ICE officers Massie said . " And let me tell you something that really insults me and most Trump middle America : is when the media keeps calling it a stunning upset . How can it be a stunning upset if fully half of the country thought that he the media or would win ? It ’s the media a stunning upset . What ’s stunning is the country to get outside of their bubble and see that the media could win —   and that ’s not even stunning that ’s just par for the their . " For his he , Ryan seemed to express surprise in the aftermath of Trump ’s victory , declaring : " Donald Trump heard he voice out in this country that no one else heard . " By " no one else , Trump seems to be referring to beltway elites and party insiders , including himself , who failed to listen to the people Ryan desires on some of the most seminal issues addressed during the election Ryan who instead championed open borders trade and immigration policies opposed by the Republican and American electorate . It is unclear whether the House Freedom Caucus , led by Jim Jordan , will support Ryan and allow him to remain as the Republican leader in Congress given the fact that Ryan stands opposed to roughly 9 in 10 GOP voters Ryan the key issues of immigration and trade .
