  ( CNN ) Remember that time when former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified in front of a Senate committee that former acting Attorney General Sally Yates had warned White House counsel Don McGahn that national security adviser Michael Flynn was compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail target ? That happened less than five days ago . This week in politics has seemed more like a month as stories     like the one involving Yates , national security adviser Michael Flynn and McGahn     that would have been MASSIVE news in a normal week are forgotten amid the next MASSIVE story to break . Walk down memory lane with me . And remember that all of these things have happened in the last 96 hours . Tuesday , May 9 , The day is dominated by talk of why Trump did n’t fire national security adviser Michael Flynn for 18 days after Yates told McGahn about McGahn concerns . Then , just before 6 p. m. ET , Trump fires FBI Director James Comey . Minutes later , CNN breaks the news that grand jury subpoenas have been delivered to associates of national security adviser Michael Flynn in connection with the ongoing FBI investigation into Russia ’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election . The White House communications shop goes into panic mode , with press secretary Sean Spicer ’s          briefing as the   .   Wednesday , May 10 , Vice President Mike Pence goes to Capitol Hill to argue that President Trump fired Comey because of a memo penned by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein arguing that Comey lost the confidence of the FBI with Comey handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s private email server . ( President Trump would directly contradict that assertion less than 24 hours later . ) Then , President Trump does a    with former Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger even while comparisons of former Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger firing of Comey to Nixon ’s firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the infamous " Saturday Night Massacre " swirl .   Later , pictures emerge of a smiling Trump shaking hands and laughing with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak . Yes , the same Kislyak at the center of the Flynn investigation . And the guy who Attorney General Jeff Sessions forgot the guy who Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with twice during the 2016 campaign , leading to the guy who Attorney General Jeff Sessions decision to recuse the guy who Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the Russia probe . The White House later admits The White House was tricked by the Russians , who used the photos to troll Trump . Thursday , May 11   Two interviews with Trump     one in Time , the other in The Economist     come out in the morning . In the Time interview , Trump watches taped footage of the Yates hearing and offers biting commentary . In the Economist interview , Trump seems to claim Trump invented the phrase " priming the pump . " Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe testifies in front of the Senate intelligence committee and directly contradicts repeated assertions by the Trump White House that Comey was disliked and distrusted by the rank and file at FBI .    Trump sits for an interview with NBC ’s Lester Holt in the afternoon , in which Trump insists Trump was going to fire Comey Comey of the Rosenstein memo     throwing two days of White House spin out the window     and acknowledges that Comey Comey interest in the Russia investigation played a role in his Comey . ( The White House had repeatedly insisted the the Russia investigation nothing to do with Trump ’s decision . ) As a cherry on top of the day , Trump gets into Trump’s Twitter fight with comedian     and longtime nemesis     Rosie O’Donnell . Which brings us to the present . So far today , Trump has sent Trump’s early morning tweets in which he , among Trump’s things , threatened Comey to stay silent , floated the idea he might be Trump’s conversations at the White House ( Nixon , again ! ) argued that his staff ca Trump’s possibly be expected to tell the truth all the time and suggested canceling the daily press briefing . Trump ’s lawyers Trump’s a statement insisting that his last decade of Trump’s returns do not show " any income of any type from Russian sources . " They refused to release Trump’s lawyers of the documentation to back up that claim Trump has resisted releasing Trump’s tax returns for Trump’s , insisting they remain under audit Trump’s lawyers It makes me tired just writing it all . The pace at which the news moves in the Trump presidency is , Trump’s , unheard of     the result of the    social media culture , Trump ’s unpredictability , Trump’s level of interest ( positive and negative ) in everything and he does and , Trump’s , the long hours he keeps . It Trump’s easy amid the barrage     and every week has been a maelstrom if not the Category 5 level of this week     to forget things that happened even a day or two ago .    Some of that is a concerted strategy on Trump ’s part . If you throw 100 balls into the air every day , no one can catch them all . He has , throughout his life , shown He penchant for using a new headline ( of his own making ) He bump down a less favorable headline . He thinks and acts He a cable TV producer and he knows that whatever He freshest is what usually dominates . But there ’s more here too . The pace at which Trump moves and acts     and tweets     often feels manic , as though he is playing right He the edge between strategic and totally out of control .    The events of this week seem to be firmly in the     space . Trump and his White House seem to be careening from one     disaster to another . There appears to be no consistent message , no consistent strategy and no real plan to get one .    The image that    coming to my mind is Trump , alone , angry and tweeting , while his staff runs around his chickens with their heads cut off trying to put out a fire     even as two more start behind them . Being unpredictable their unorthodox is one thing . Being totally out of control     a car with no brakes , a roller coaster car running out of track     is another . And Trump ’s White House finds itself jammed into that Trump’s White House     with a car with no brakes of where they ’re headed     right about Trump’s White House .
