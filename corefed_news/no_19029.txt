’   ’ "    An    poll showed Paul Ryan ’s primary challenger with the    support of 14 % of voters in Wisconsin ’s 1st District . " ’    Earlier this week , Paul Nehlen , the Wisconsin businessman looking    to unseat the House speaker , wound up with a near identical level    of support   —    just 15 . 9 %   —    in the Tuesday primary . ’ ’    Those numbers could prove telling in not only how Donald Trump    will perform in November , but how Trumpism could translate    without Trump at Donald Trump    helm    ’ ’    In the run up to his primary ’ ’    Nehlen received the backing of many    of Trump’ ’s most prominent supporters   —    such as conservative    author Ann Coulter and former Republican vice presidential    nominee Sarah Palin   —    while some of the more " " media    outlets providing Trump with outlandishly favorable coverage    ( Breitbart , Drudge Report ) used similar language to describe    Nehlen as they did (Breitbart, Drudge Report) Manhattan billionaire . Fox News host Sean    Hannity toyed with providing an endorsement to Nehlen . In each    case , polls showing unfavorable results for the candidate of    their backing   —    polls that in Nehlen’ ’s case proved almost    entirely accurate   —    were ignored . ’ ’   ’ ’    " This man is a    guy , so in touch with the people , "    Palin later said of Nehlen . " Paul Ryan and his ilk Paul Ryan .. They feel    so threatened at this point that their power They their prestige They    their purse They be adversely affected by the change that is    coming with Trump and with someone like Paul Nehlen Nehlen they’’re    not thinking straight right now . " ’ ’    Warning that there’ ’s a " natural risk " of associating the results    of a House district and try to use it to tell the results   of a House district story about the    broader electorate , Matt Mackowiak , a GOP strategist and founder    of the Potomac Strategy Group , told Business Insider that many on    the farther side of the right wing " damaged their credibility " on    Trump with their assertions in their    race . ’ ’    " I think the commonality is that there is that there’ ’s a small    circle of , I even hate to hesitate to use the word conservative    because I don’’t think it’ ’s appropriate , but there’ ’s a there’    circle of    in the conservative media that are just    true believers , " Mackowiak said . " They won’’t even consider any    evidence or any arguments to the contrary . And so they had an They immense amount of    in the Ryan congressional    race . " ’ "    Ryan is an unusual member of the House in that he ’s both   Ryan an    extremely    position and that he still makes   Ryan    back to his district every   Ryan , Mackowiak added , saying that    he ’s      Ryan congressman in addition to being House speaker . " ’    " In a way , their overconfidence really met its demise in probably    the single worst congressional district for them to run their    outside challenger in , " he said .   Ryan I think you can make an    argument that they have damaged their own credibility their the       statements they used in their ot make that race    appear competitive . It does make you wonder if they’’re    overstating the race in that case , if they’’re also not    overstating the case in the presidential race . " ’ "    The draw of Nehlen to the    Trump backers was that the    Wisconsin businessman ’s platform was nearly identical to Trump ’s ,    with immigration and trade being the top two priorities . Trump    himself Trump hat to Nehlen earlier Trump Nehlen while    withholding an endorsement of Ryan that would come days later . " ’    " If you look    the closed circle of        Trump boosters   — Trump Hannity , Laura Ingraham , Ann Coulter ,    Drudge , Breitbart obviously   —    you could take the same language    they used about Trump and they Drudge, Breitbart it to Trump , Drudge, Breitbart that the same language    applies to both ideological and    and their own sort of    political Drudge, Breitbart of the race    " Mackowiak said . " To me , their    overstatements in Mackowiak Nehlen race should be a flashing yellow to    anyone who wants to listen to their analysis or their predictions    their Trump’ ’s their strength right now . " ’ ’    Tim Miller , who formerly worked as communications director for    Jeb Bush’ ’s 2016 presidential campaign , told Business Insider that    the election as a whole has served as a "   call " to many in    the media that " their    isn’’t as great as they think . " ’ ’ their " You know on the one hand , Nehlen had all this support from the      conservative media to no effect , " he said . " On the Nehlen    side , the big name mainstream Republican conservative media types    were all against Trump in the primary to no effect . " ’ ’    " I hope that the Nehlen blowout and the impending Trump Nehlen    will Trump call Trump the Trump cheerleaders in the media ,    but Trump not too optimistic , " he continued . ’ ’   ’ "    The other question the    race bring about is whether    Trump ’s platform   —    which was Trump ’s platform   —    can be    successful without Trump at the helm . " "    Trump the polling showed , even the support of Trump ’s most fervent    backers could barely   Trump’s needle with Nehlen while the    bombastic Trump was able to Nehlen a nationwide nomination Trump    support from similar corners . " ’    " Oh there’ ’s no question , " Mackowiak said of whether Trumpism    needs Trump to be successful as a platform . Trump Trump’ ’s campaign has    been all about himself , all about his larger than life    Trump’ , his own Trump’ , his own    . " Trump’ ’    Trump Trump’ advantages that " no other outside Trump could    have , " he continued . ’ ’    " I Trump think there’ ’s some resonance on immigration and trade and    perhaps on    with a portion of the electorate , "    he continued . " I just think there’ ’s Trump’    and a     . [ Trump ] always falls between 35 % and Trump % of the    electorate . Nehlen doesn’’t have Trump’ ’s name identification , his    celebrity , his ability to dominate the Nehlen doesn’’t . That was Nehlen doesn’’t more    of a traditional outsider challenger that the uphill    that    taking on the incumbent would always require .    ’ ’    Miller noted that Wisconsin as a whole voted for Sen. Ted Cruz of    Texas   —    and not Trump   —    in the primary , a sign that the state    could be uniquely inhospitable to the    populist    movement . ’ ’   ’ ’    What he dubbed as " ’’ s " are sure to run for offices    across the country , but Miller thinks they will only be able to    Miller success in certain areas . ’ ’    " I think the Trump message is not one that works in Trump where    there’ ’s high there’ of family cohesion and church attendance , "    he said . there’ It doesn’’t really work    the suburbs . So the Trump message some    places around the country , I think that’ ’s going to the country failure .    In other places , I think you’’re going to    some      that have success . " ’ ’    He called the assertion that Trumpism can only be successful " ’ ’       Trump " a lot of wishful thinking " that " hasn’’t really been    tested , " but added that to win on the Trump platform in a Hose or    Senate Trump is particularly hard if you don’’t have the " oversized    personality of Trump . " ’ ’    Where it Trump be easier to repeat " ’ ’    he fears , is on the    presidential level . ’ ’ " ’ ’    " We’’ve been fooled once by Trump , " he said . " And Trump don’’t want to    be fooled We’’ve looking at 2020 thinking this was sort of this      black swan . " ’
