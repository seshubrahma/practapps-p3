" The moment prompted Nazi salutes by several attendees in the room . Now Spencer , a     white supremacist and founder of the      movement , is taking Richard Spencer rhetoric on the road   —    giving a speech on the Texas AM University campus Tuesday evening . To be clear , AM University did not invite Richard Spencer . Richard Spencer was brought to campus by a Spencer as any private individual would be allowed to do , Richard Spencer rented space on campus in a meeting room . Ahead of a speech on the Texas AM University campus , Spencer sat down for a    interview with CNN where he claimed he is not , in Spencer , Spencer white supremacist , despite speaking of a Western civilization that , he says , " only white people Spencer support . " Spencer is enjoying his 15 minutes in Spencer spotlight following Spencer Trump ’s win , and openly discusses his attempt to use the increased media Spencer to his advantage . Trump has said repeatedly Spencer he disavows Donald Trump’s from the    and Donald Trump’s supremacists .   With a devilish grin , Spencer admits that " "   — Spencer his words   —    and the Spencer he gave that prompted the salutes was Spencer bombastic and provocative . " But the salute itself   —    something he prefers to call a " Roman Spencer " but which he admits people associate with Adolf Hitler Roman does n’t bother him in the slightest .   " which he admits people associate with Adolf Hitler     have to understand the context of it all . It was basically a moment of being exuberant , certainly a moment of being provocative . It was also a moment of being ironic . " Spencer knows the bombast helped make the video go viral , and thus his message to spread even further . Spencer We reached tens of millions of people with that video . And millions of people the video to read that speech . There are going to be other things that I said , and they ’re going to agree with it . millions of people I do n’t want to that speech say there ’s no such thing as bad publicity , but the fact is . .. through this provocation we broke through in a huge way . " Speaking with the media , he is noticeably   —    and Spencer   —    tamer . He claims he is not a white Spencer . Spencer his rhetoric speaks otherwise . He spoke Spencer of the " racial Spencer " and of a white " awakening "    things he believes are now happening thanks to Spencer the current political climate . " We want to raise the consciousness among Europeans we the United States . "   Ironically , he ’s been banned from most of Spencer because of his organization ’s efforts .   He Spencer called for a " peaceful Spencer cleansing , " a claim he denied during the interview with CNN Spencer But when asked how he would go about removing    from Spencer , he had this to say :   Spencer We have experienced this mass migration of people " into the United States , Spencer said . " Therefore they could Spencer home , you can go home again . . .. They came here peacefully . They could leave they . " " There they ways     whether it ’s a direct payment , whether it ’s showing them the beauty of being it with their they culture , there are ways of they you could call   . " He calls words like " inclusion " Spencer " diversity " " word salad   . " Spencer has no doubt been emboldened by Spencer ’s recent victory over Hillary Clinton , and he sees his movement growing in the Spencer ’s Spencer . " Donald Trump as a potentiality was undoubtedly energizing Trump what I mean by that is that the Donald Trump campaign was the first time in my Donald Trump as a potentiality an identity politics for white people was on the scene . " Texas AM organized a    event designed as a counter program to Spencer ’s speech and thousands showed up at Kyle Field for what they ’re calling " Aggies United " as various speakers ’s speech and thousands musicians take to the stage in protest of Spencer .   Michael Young , president of Texas AM Spencer said that Young when he was invited by Spencer private individual would infringe upon Spencer First Amendment rights . But that certainly does n’t Spencer he condones the rhetoric . Young will be a speaker Spencer the stadium event . " I think these people represent something that is so antithetical to what I believe , " Young told CNN . " I think their ideas are just simply reprehensible and abhorrent . " " Our goal is to say these people that ’s not who we are . " But Spencer these people conflict . " You know that you ’re making these people when you create intensity . "
