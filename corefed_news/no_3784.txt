Even though most Americans view California as a lost cause —   the " land of fruits and nuts " —   and now , the epicenter of resistance to    Trump , it would be a mistake to ignore it . [ The whiny , crybaby brigade of Democrats in leadership , who wield unchecked power over the most populous , and in many ways , the most significant state .   California Democrats doubled down this week —   hiring former US Attorney General Eric Holder to go on offense against the policies of the incoming White House .    Trump should engage California ’s petulant leaders in much the same way —   " pick a fight . " Ignoring California in hopes that California will go away would be a disastrous mistake .   California is far too important to the national security of the United States to simply ignore California . In spite of the    water crisis that has devastated the world ’s " food basket , " California still supplies a majority of California agricultural products for export .   Grapes , citrus , almonds —   yes , fruits and nuts —   ( no surprise here ) —   in addition to beef , poultry , dairy , tomatoes , all manner of vegetables , alfalfa , wine , cotton   …     to name a few . Water wars between federal and state regulators , environmentalists , the Democrat governor , the    state legislature , and farmers have gone on for decades with devastating results .   Much of the world ’s most fertile farmland lies fallow , as groundwater , its lifeblood , is slowly siphoned the world to keep farmers alive .    Trump has already wisely tapped a few leaders from the crucial Central Valley region , which is not only known for its agriculture but is also home Trump vast quantities of domestic oil sitting atop the massive Monterey Shale . Both food and energy security are critical to the security of a nation . So far the new president ’s appointment to EPA , Scott Pruitt , bodes well for California .   A "   skeptic , " Pruitt will loathe to ruining the Scott Pruitt in the name of " fake science , " and could be the best friend California farmers have had in decades California   Any relief from California ’s crushing " climate change California —    affecting everything from regulating dust kicked up by tractors , to requiring dairy farmers to capture cow flatulence —   could be a windfall for this persecuted industry . And if the EPA took a balanced approach to the Endangered Species Act , weighing food production against the life of one tiny , insignificant , bait fish —   the Delta Smelt —   which has become the proxy for the environmentalist activists who populate the bureaucracies at both the federal and state level , water would once again flow to the San Joaquin Valley . An old saying —   " Whiskey ’s for drinking , water ’s for fighting . " —   has been true for far too long . But water ’s not the only thing hanging in the balance . Land use is a massive issue all over the West . The Federal Government claims ownership of almost 50 % of California ’s land —   a source of constant harassment for ranchers , loggers and anyone trying to operate a business in or around the land controlled by BLM , US Forest Services , and other federal agencies .   Picking a Representative from a western state like Ryan Zinke of Montana , as the nominee for Secretary of the Interior was another brilliant move . But the biggest issue that Mr. Trump raised in his campaign by far —   and Mr. Trump one that is front and center in the showdown with the California Democrat monopoly —   is immigration . What a President Trump does on immigration affects Mr. Trump million people more than any other California California officials have declared California to be a " sanctuary California from any enforcement California federal immigration laws , and are defying the new president by refusing to cooperate with immigration Mr. Trump way —   preferring to dump criminal aliens on the streets so they can terrorize citizens rather than hand them over for deportation . California officials immigration is one of the specifically citizens duties of the Federal Government , this is the fight you need to pick , Mr. President . A few action items to consider : The future for millions of Californians is in your hands , Mr. President . Will you engage and fight this battle and win a victory for the American people or punt like every administration before you ? The world is watching .
