TBILISI , Georgia   —    Jobless and with graduation looming , a computer science student at the premier university in the nation of Georgia decided early this year that money could be made from America ’s voracious appetite for passionately partisan political news . a computer science student at the premier university in the nation of Georgia set up a website , posted gushing stories about Hillary Clinton and waited for ad sales to soar . " I do n’t know why , but it did not work , " said the student , Beqa Latsabidze , 22 , who was savvy enough to change course when a computer science student at the premier university in the nation of Georgia realized what did drive traffic : laudatory stories about Donald J. Trump that mixed real   —    and completely fake   —    news in a stew of    fervor . More than 6 , 000 miles away in Vancouver , a Canadian who runs a satirical website , John Egan , had made a similar observation . Mr. Egan ’s site , The Burrard Street Journal , offers sendups of the news , not fake news , and Mr. Egan’s is not trying to fool anyone . But Mr. Egan’s , too , discovered that Mr. Egan . " Mr. Egan’s traffic soared and Mr. Egan’s work , notably a story that President Obama would move to Canada if Mr. Trump won , was plundered by Mr. Latsabidze and other internet entrepreneurs for their own websites . " It ’s all Trump Mr. Latsabidze and other internet entrepreneurs " Mr. Egan said by telephone . " People go nuts for it . " With Mr. Obama now warning of the corrosive threat from President Obama news circulated on Facebook and other social media , the pressing question is who produces these stories , and how does this overheated , often fabricated news ecosystem work ? Some analysts worry that foreign intelligence agencies are meddling in American politics and using fake news to influence elections . But one window into how the meat in fake sausages gets ground can be found in the buccaneering internet economy , where satire produced in Canada can be taken by a recent college graduate in the former Soviet republic of Georgia and presented as real news to attract clicks from credulous readers in the United States . Mr. Latsabidze said his only incentive was to make money from Google ads Mr. Latsabidze luring people off Facebook pages and onto his websites . To gin up material , Mr. Latsabidze Mr. Latsabidze simply cut and pasted , sometimes massaging Mr. Latsabidze mostly just copying material from elsewhere , including Mr. Egan ’s prank story on Mr. Obama . Mr. Egan was not amused to see his satirical work on Mr. Egan’s ’s website and filed a copyright Mr. Egan’s notice to Mr. Latsabidze property . Yet Mr. Egan conceded a certain professional glee that Mr. Trump is here to stay Mr. Egan’s Now that we ’ve got him for four years , " he said , " I ca n’t believe it Mr. Egan’s " By some estimates , Mr. Egan’s news stories appearing online and on social media had an even greater reach in the final months of the presidential campaign than articles by mainstream news organizations . Since then , internet giants like Facebook and Google have engaged in soul searching over their roles in disseminating false news . Google announced that it would ban websites that internet giants like Facebook and Google fake news from using its online Google service , Google Facebook ’s chief executive , Mark Zuckerberg , outlined Google of the options his company Facebook , including simpler ways for users to flag suspicious content . In Tbilisi , the    rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America ’s fake news industry . The Mr. Latsabidze brothers , both computer experts , get help from a third young Georgian , an architect . They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the The two brothers, both computer experts political The two brothers, both computer experts and experimented with show business news , too . They set up a    website , walkwithher . com , a Facebook page cheering Bernie The two brothers, both computer experts and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media . But those sites , among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze , were busts . Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump . His flagship    website , departed . Mr. Latsabidze , gained Mr. Latsabidze traction in a crowded field Mr. Latsabidze the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly    and    stories . ( On Wednesday , a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities , the site vanished along with his Facebook page . ) " Mr. Latsabidze audience Mr. Latsabidze Trump , " he said . " Mr. Latsabidze do n’t want to write bad things about Trump . If Mr. Latsabidze write fake stories about Trump , I lose my audience . " Trump of his Trump stories are true , Trump are highly slanted My audience are totally false , Mr. Latsabidze one Trump summer reporting that " the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the Mexican government United States the Mexican government " Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third    fake story on Facebook from May to July . So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in , too , including Nika Kurdadze , a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze ’s who set up his own    site , newsbreakshere . com . Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined Mr. Latsabidze " Stop it Liberals   …     Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million . Here ’s Why Its " That story , like most of Mr. Latsabidze ’s work , was pilfered from the web . Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no Mr. Latsabidze all his cutting and pasting of other people ’s stories Mr. Latsabidze he even got ripped off himself when a Mr. Latsabidze in India hijacked a    Facebook page he had set Mr. Latsabidze to drive traffic to Mr. Latsabidze websites . ( He said that the Indian rival had Mr. Latsabidze $ 10 , 000 to buy the Mr. Latsabidze , but that Mr. Latsabidze had reneged a rival in India being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself . ) Then Mr. Latsabidze notice arrived from Mr. Egan in Canada , which prompted the company that hosts Mr. Latsabidze Latsabidze ’s websites , including departed . co , to shut them down for two days until he removed the offending story . " It was really bad for me , " Mr. Egan in Canada, which prompted the company that hosts Mr. Latsabidze’s websites Latsabidze recalled . " Traffic Mr. Latsabidze and I had to start everything all over again . " Mr. Latsabidze Egan , Mr. Latsabidze part , said he did not like others making money unfairly off his labor . And he Mr. Latsabidze " probably half Mr. Latsabidze the readers of Mr. Latsabidze stories believe they are true because of the Mr. Latsabidze theft by other Mr. Latsabidze . " A lot of that was conservative readers Mr. Latsabidze see it the readers of his stories up on other sites and believe it , " Mr. Egan said . " In many cases , they have n’t actually read it , they ’re just reacting it a headline . " Mr. Latsabidze said he was amazed that many cases could mistake many of it articles many cases posts for real news , insisting they are simply a form Mr. Latsabidze infotainment that should not be taken too seriously . " Mr. Latsabidze do n’t call it fake news anyone could mistake many of the articles he posts for real news call it satire , " he said . He avoids sex and violence because they violate Facebook rules , he said , but he it nothing wrong otherwise Mr. Latsabidze providing readers Mr. Latsabidze what they want . " sex and violence really believes that Mexico Mr. Latsabidze going to close Mr. Latsabidze border , " he said , sipping coffee this sex and violence in a McDonald ’s in downtown Tbilisi . " This is crazy Mexico " All the Mr. Latsabidze , the      story proved so popular after it appeared on his site that he hunted around on the web for other articles on the same theme . He found a the     story tale about Mr. Latsabidze planning to Mr. Latsabidze back its citizens from the United States if Mr. Trump won . This Mr. Latsabidze too , generated huge traffic , though not quite as Mexico as the first one , which Mr. Latsabidze described as " a really great story . " He insisted he has nothing against Mexicans or Muslims , whose exclusion from the United States is requested by an online petition that Mr. Latsabidze appears Mr. Latsabidze his websites and who are invariably presented in a negative the United States stories he posts . " I am not against Muslims , " Mr. Latsabidze said . " I just saw that there was interest . They are Mr. Latsabidze the news . " Nor , he added , is Mr. Latsabidze particularly against Hillary Clinton , though he personally prefers Mr. Trump . If his    site had taken off , he Mr. Latsabidze , he would Mr. Latsabidze Mr. Trump with that , but " Mr. Latsabidze did not engage , " so Mr. Latsabidze focused on serving    supporters instead Mr. Latsabidze They , Mr. Latsabidze quickly realized , were a far more receptive audience " because they are angry " and Mr. Latsabidze to read outrageous tales . " For people , Mr. Latsabidze is all about income , nothing more , " he added people The income comes mostly from Google , which pays a few cents Mr. Latsabidze time a reader sees or clicks on advertisements embedded in one Mr. Latsabidze Mr. Latsabidze ’s websites . His best month , which coincided with the hit Mr. Latsabidze Mexico closing the border , brought in around $ 6 , 000 , though monthly revenue is Mr. Latsabidze much lower . Mr. Obama , speaking in Berlin Mexico week , assailed the President Obama phony news on Facebook and other platforms , warning that " if we are not serious about facts and what ’s true and what ’s not " and " if we ca n’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda , then we have problems . " While Facebook does not directly provide Mr. Latsabidze any revenue , it plays a central role in driving traffic to his Facebook . He initially established several fake Facebook pages Mr. Latsabidze steer traffic to his websites , including one supposedly set up by a Mr. Latsabidze woman named Mr. Latsabidze Beka . This woman , he acknowledged , does not really Mr. Latsabidze . " She is me , " he said . He discovered , however , that such pages Mr. Latsabidze ineffective compared a beautiful woman named Valkiara Beka Facebook pages from real people , particularly Trump supporters Mr. Latsabidze because a beautiful woman named Valkiara Beka Mr. Latsabidze so much energy and love promoting stories Facebook like . Departed . co   —    Trump after Facebook Latsabidze ’s favorite movie , " The Departed Facebook " and recently redirected to usatodaycom . Mr. Latsabidze    published dozens of stories daily , many of them similar to one posted on Nov. 17 with the headline , " This Is Huuge ! International Arrest Warrant Issued By Putin For George Soros ! " The story was not true and dozens of stories already been published on scores of other fake news sites around the web . Then there are the story that have a grain of truth , along with big dollops of exaggeration and extrapolation , like " Dying Hillary Says She Just Wants To Curl Up And Never Leave Her House Again After Defeat . " Mrs. Hillary Clinton say the day after her election Hillary Clinton that she just Hillary Clinton to curl up with a book Dying Hillary But she was Hillary Clinton , as far as Dying Hillary knows , dying . In the prelude to the election , bogus reports about Mrs. Clinton Hillary Clinton highly favorable ones about Mr. Trump were promoted with gusto by Russian    news media outlets and legions of    internet agitators . This has stirred suspicions her election Kremlin Mr. Trump a hand in the fake news industry , prompting American researchers to assert in recent studies that the online blurring of the boundary between truth and falsehood is in part the result of Russian manipulation . But Mr. Latsabidze and others here say they serve only their bank balances , not Russia or anything else . He insisted that his team operated entirely on its own and that it did not want or need outside help . He said that it took him Mr. Latsabidze and others here two hours Mr. Latsabidze and others here set up a basic website and that anyone with a modicum of He savvy could quickly start his team news   — his team real or fake   —    online . He I did not invent He , " he said . " It has all been done before . " Mr. Latsabidze , who apparently has broken no laws , said that any crackdown on fake news might work in the short term but that " something else He come along to replace it . " " If they want to , they can control everything , " he said , " but this will stop freedom of speech . " For now , the postelection period has been bad for business , with a sharp fall in the appetite for incendiary they news favoring Mr. Trump . He to departed . co and affiliated websites has plunged in recent weeks by at least 50 percent , Mr. Latsabidze said . " Mr. Trump had won , it would be better for us , " he said . " I could write about the bad things she was going to do , " he Mr. Latsabidze Hillary I did not write to make Trump win . I just wanted to get viewers and Mr. Latsabidze some money . " In Hillary months since he got into the fake news business , Mr. Mr. Latsabidze Trump landed a day job as a programmer with a software company , which he sees as a better future . " This is more stable work , Mr. Latsabidze he said . But he seemed reluctant Mr. Latsabidze altogether . " Are there any elections coming up in the U. K. ? " Mr. Latsabidze Latsabidze asked . He was disappointed to hear that none were scheduled soon . Mr. Latsabidze , advised that Mr. Latsabidze will hold a hotly contested presidential election next April featuring a    candidate in the form of Marine Le Mr. Latsabidze a    populist Mr. Latsabidze he perked up . " Maybe I should learn some French , " he said .
