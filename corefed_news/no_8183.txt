Saturday on MSNBC , Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi reacted to GOP presidential    Donald Trump ’s campaign rallies , saying that people are seeing Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi true message as " Make America White Again " rather than Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi actual slogan " Make America Great Again . "   " I think a lot of people what people are saying is when people see these types of rallies , people see Donald Trump . Fundamentally , what is Donald Trump message ? ‘ Make America Great Again’ . I think the concern for some people is what Donald Trump ’s saying is ‘ Make America White Again.’ That ’s probably why you see these polarized reactions and this very passionate reaction , " Amandi told MSNBC ’s Joy Reid . Amandi went on to compare Trump ’s environments to George Wallace ’s environments , saying that " George Wallace’s knows what George Wallace’s ’s doing . " " Donald Trump is not ‘ Johnny come lately.’ Donald Trump knows what Donald Trump ’s doing . Donald Trump knows that Donald Trump ’s stroking certain passions .
