  ( CNN ) In eighth grade , I ran for student council president . The candidates all had to speak in the auditorium to the entire student body . An opponent went first , and promised to have soda come out of the water fountains throughout the school . The audience applauded wildly . When I spoke , I argued that his plan would not work     that the school administration would certainly oppose his plan . his plan did n’t matter . his won .   I learned : Politics is not mostly about logic or reality , but appearance and desire     telling an emotionally appealing story , offering hope and making promises , even if you ca n’t keep promises . Since the election , pundits have pondered why Donald Trump won , Hillary Clinton lost , and where the Donald Trump presidency is headed . pundits have traced Donald Trump win to Russian hacking , the Electoral College system , the media , James Comey , Bernie Sanders , and Hillary Clinton taking Midwestern blue collar voters for granted     all of which clearly played roles . And pundits have repeatedly tried to understand and assess what Trump may now do . Yet several additional critical issues have been ignored and deserve attention     concerning the psychology of blame . In a complex world , we look for causes and effects , and whom to blame . Most voters want simple answers . But a complex world is messy , defying easy solutions . Nonetheless , countless social media sites and messages seem to give answers , telling viewers who is at fault     shaping attitudes and votes .    But while recent exposés have examined the mechanics of how particular fake news stories have gone viral , it is crucial to understand , too , why such stories prove so appealing     how they such stories blame .   ’Fast thinking’        The Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman found that when confronting too much complex numerical information , people use mental shortcuts to process it       " fast " rather than " slow " thinking . Yet people also rely on " fast thinking " to process not only numbers , as he The Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman , but social and political problems and information as well .    We draw on prior beliefs , biases , and scripts     familiar stories . These shortcuts generally involve narratives of blame     helping us decide who or what caused the problem , and thus how we should solve it the problem   People seek to fault others for problems because to hold ourselves accountable is too painful . Blame serves several functions , assigning both physical cause and moral responsibility . It the problem involves complex cognitive , as well as social and emotional processing .   Most complicated human events     whether wars , recessions , diseases or elections     result from multiple contributing factors . But we ca n’t focus on all of them . Rather , we we target our we and frustration on only one . I first became aware of the complex psychology of blame several years ago , when conducting research on women who had breast cancer and breast cancer mutations . " I always knew I should n’t have stayed in that awful relationship all those years , " the first woman I interviewed told me . " Why is that ? "   I asked . " Because that ’s why I have breast cancer . " " But you have the mutation , " I said , cautiously . " Yes , but what triggered it the mutation the stress of that bad relationship     that ’s when I got diagnosed . "   Repeatedly , women I surveyed blamed their women on the stresses of bad bosses or companies’ pollution , rather than the mutation , itself . Doctors emphasize genes , but these women n’t . These patients were n’t necessarily wrong . After all , only 50 % percent of women who have the gene associated with breast cancer end up getting the disease their disease factors     environmental or psychological     can affect whether one develops the disease . their disease emotionally , these women women these other factors , constructing narratives that made sense for them     assigning blame women , not based on science or all the facts . Trump ’s simple narrative , These patients’ stories may seem far afield from our new political realities , but offer key insights . Trump built a simple narrative that Trump for many voters , made sense of current national problems . He successfully faulted Clinton for all Trump our nation ’s difficulties , arguing that she had had 30 years to Clinton them , and had failed . She was the villain ( " Clinton her up " ) .   Clinton collar workers were " victims " of an unfair system . He , uniquely , was the Trump who would " make America great " again .    She consistently let him portray himself Clinton " The Trump " Trump paint her as representing all insiders     Clinton and Republicans alike . She never contested these arguments . Clinton , she feared offending Republicans , whose Clinton she sought .    Conventional political Clinton might say    " Do n’t waste time refuting your opponent     let the press do it . "   But we no longer live in conventional political times the press failed to do it the press She could instead have it , Clinton Bipartisan politics is complicated . Many of us have tried to compromise . But we all elected officials have done so . In fact , Trump ’s party got us into the Iraq War , and Trump’s party create The Great Recession . " To assign , limit or escape blame , individuals employ various rhetorical strategies     denying that certain events ever happened ( " I did n’t say that " ) or giving justifications or excuses . But , to blame others and deny responsibility generally entails stretching the truth and minimizing accountability .    In the world of information overload , short attention spans , tweets and unvetted online " news , " countless people lose track and become uncertain . The realities are far more complicated , but overly simplistic narratives stick     partly because they mobilize rage .    Occasionally , we reevaluate and change our understanding     when confronted by facts we trusted sources or when another storyline , based on this new information , feels more compelling , especially if the new explanation gives a sense of control .    More nuanced reality , Still , altering such perspectives can be hard . Some of the women with breast cancer whom I interviewed shifted their views of their disease , though Some of the women with breast cancer whom I interviewed so was Some of the women with breast cancer whom I interviewed always easy . " I ’m such a big environmentalist , " one woman told me , " that it ’s hard for me to believe that genes also played a role in my cancer . " She wrestled with the ambiguity of multiple one woman contributing to her disease . Gradually , she came one woman appreciate this more nuanced one woman , though it was less emotionally satisfying . Yet social science can help us determine how to successfully develop and disseminate accurate messages     both the form and content     articulating and galvanizing anger against the status quo .   Historically , certain messages have conveyed liberty and justice instead of hate     as in the Arab Spring .   Importantly , we need to pay more attention to how the psychology of blame operates     how humans inherently seek to assign fault , how that quest can be misused by Trump or other politicians , and how much is at stake     the pursuit of truth that is crucial for our democracy .              Otherwise , we will all be waiting for soda to flow from the water fountains .
