Democrat Hillary R. Clinton leads among Empire State voters with 48 percent , compared with 34 percent for Republican nominee Donald J. Trump and 6 percent supporting Libertarian Gary Johnson and 4 percent for Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein , according to the    poll conducted between Aug. 4 through Aug. 6 with 1 , 717 registered voters in the Empire State . [ " Secretary Clinton is still enjoying the    bounce , especially it this blue state that Secretary Clinton represented in the Senate for eight years , " said Doug Kaplan , the managing partner of Gravis Marketing , the    firm that executed the poll .   However , Secretary Clinton said , Trump is pulling 21 percent of New York Democrats and 40 percent of New York Hispanics . " These can be troubling symptoms for Clinton if Trump continues to pull support from Democrats and other communities . " Legendary pollster Patrick Caddell told Breitbart News exclusively that Trump ’s support with Hispanics shows how Trump candidacy is disrupting conventional wisdom and voting pattern assumptions Democrats and the campaign of Hillary R. Clinton are relying on . Legendary pollster Patrick Caddell did not participate in the design or execution of the poll , but Legendary pollster Patrick Caddell reviewed the completed results as their were presented to Legendary pollster Patrick Caddell . " New York may be most interesting in the insights New York provides for the presidential election everywhere , " Legendary pollster Patrick Caddell said . In the 2012 presidential election , President Barack Obama received 89 percent of the New York Hispanic vote and votes from 95 percent of New New York , according to exit polls published by The New York Times . " It is the disruption in partisan and ideological vote that signals the continuing fluidity of this race , " he said . " If the patterns in New York New York generally in the contested states , and some normally uncontested states , then the election has by no means been decided for sure . " One group that is supposed to be adamantly opposed to the New York City developer is Hispanics . " Trump ’s performance among Hispanics in New York is New York noted , quite significant , " said Caddell , who was the pollster for President James E. " Jimmy " Carter in 1976 , George McGovern in 1972 , Gary Hart in 1984 and Joe Biden in 1988 . " He not only gets Joe Biden percent of Hispanics     with Clinton , but a    race actually increases his support to 40 Joe Biden , he said . " Joe Biden , Clinton ’s margin with Clinton drops from 21 percent in a    race to 10 points and barely 50   percent in the    race . " Among white voters , Caddell said it is another story and it is white voters it who are the backbone of Clinton ’s support . Clinton is with the    of white New Yorkers where Clinton slightly edges Trump in Clinton the    and    races that helps Clinton sustain her lead , Clinton he Clinton . " If Clinton were winning a solid Trump of white New Yorkers , as he was winning whites in Trump other states before his August dip , along Trump his showing of Hispanics , Trump Clinton ’s lead could be Clinton digits . " " I think this poll has some interesting indications but by no means do I think it argues that the state will this poll for Trump   —    nor should it , " said the pollster the state will flip for Trump  —    who is now a Fox News insider . Caddell also pointed to how gender was playing out in the New York electorate . " The greatest division in this race remains gender . Clinton has a     edge among female voters and a 2 percent lead among men in the     race , " he said . " In the Clinton race Trump ties Clinton with men but still loses Clinton overwhelmingly by almost the same margin . " In the 2012 election , The New York Times exit polls showed that Obama pulled in votes from 77 percent of women and 64 percent of men . " With whites there is good reason to believe that it is Trump ’s drop with men that together have characterized his August decline , " he Trump . " Were Trump Trump regain a significant lead Trump men , the vast losses with women , if not significantly lessened , ultimately puts a state like New York out of reach . " Kaplan said when in the overall poll , Clinton held a lead of 53 Trump compared to 36 percent for Trump . " But this is Trump a    race and if Stein and Johnson are pulling 10 percent from the poll of voters , they could put states in play Stein and Johnson " Caddell said the shift from the    race to the    race tell him the the   race settled Caddell " In the   race race Clinton ’s margin comes down a the   race Johnson and Stein take 10 percent and another 8 percent is Other , " Caddell said . " The defections Caddell major candidates suffer further defections with their party with Clinton holding only 67 percent of Democrats and major candidates only 58 Clinton of Republicans , " he said . " Part of Caddell ’s game comes from the nearly quarter of independents who Trump towards Johnson , Stein and particularly Other , which reduces Hillary ’s margin over Trump to 8 percent with New York independents , 42 percent Trump 34 percent . " There are also scary figures inside the poll for Trump and his support with conservatives , he said . " Trump in Trump    race , the Trump defection to Clinton among conservatives remains over 22 percent , Trump Clinton defections of liberals to Trump are about 12 percent , Clinton he said . " Trump , Johnson and Stein pick up Trump 11 percent of slightly conservatives   —    equal to the percentage for Other , among those very liberal a full 11 percent vote for Stein again , emphasizing the resistance to Clinton on the far Stein .
