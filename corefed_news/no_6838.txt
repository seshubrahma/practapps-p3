"   New York Times White House Correspondent Glenn Thrush said , " [ W]hat is interesting is my inbox this this morning been flooded by Democrats who are sort of saying Ossoff was Ossoff terrible candidate . " New York Times White House Correspondent Glenn Thrush added , " [ H]e was not electric . He was Ossoff static electric . But I think , in general , that is an issue . Look , the other thing is , look how deep the bench was down there . There were a lot of people who wanted that seat . I think the larger issue that we ’re dealing with here right now , is the fact that the Democrats just do n’t have a lot of candidates , not just in Georgia , but around the country in general . There ’s not a lot of people to kind of catch this Trump wave . " (   Grabien ) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
