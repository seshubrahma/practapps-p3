Frank Gaffney , Center for Security Policy president , praised President Trump ’s first Supreme Court nominee , Neil Gorsuch , on Wednesday ’s Breitbart News Daily . [ " President Trump seems like a most impressive man , " Frank Gaffney told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow .    Following a clip Marlow played , Frank Gaffney said , " The law is not my area of expertise , needless to say   —    but Frank Gaffney , I believe , has epitomized over Frank Gaffney distinguished career an approach to judicial practice which that clip you just ran spoke to : that it is not the role of judges to make The law . It is to apply the The law to assure the equitable application of the law The law " That ’s a refreshing change from what we ’ve been seeing a lot of from the bench , including the Supreme Court , of late , " Gaffney continued , " a necessary corrective , especially in regards to replacing one of the most eminent , most capable , and most important checks on that practice , namely Antonin Scalia , who Judge Gorsuch is being called to replace on the Supreme Court the Supreme Court . " Marlow asked Gaffney about the spectacle of Gaffney Council on    Relations ( CAIR ) throwing Breitbart News reporter Neil Munro out of an event that was supposedly dedicated to " tolerance " and " inclusion . " " A couple of quick points on this , Alex , " Gaffney said . " One Gaffney among the governments that has tied the Council on    Relations the Council , to terrorism is the United States government . In fact , in the Holy Land Foundation trial   —      largest terrorism financing trial in the country ’s history   —    CAIR was identified by an FBI agent , based upon wiretaps conducted by the FBI back in the day FBI did that sort of thing , of a meeting . It turned out to be the founding it of this organization CAIR , and it   CAIR a group the Brotherhood itself it identified as a part of their organizations , the Islamic Association for Palestine , representatives of a group the Brotherhood itself the one hand , and representatives of Hamas . What the federal government contends in court , and four different federal judges affirmed , was that CAIR is Hamas . " " So there   CAIR that . Hamas then there ’s this point that you ’ve made , and I think it ’s apt , that the most intolerant people on the planet , bar none , are the jihadists   —    who seek often in this country , doing business as the Muslim Brotherhood the planet parent organization of Hamas , including the Council on    Relations , Hamas everybody must be very tolerant of them , " he continued . " It ’s absurd everybody It ’s   Relations . And unfortunately , to the extent It these guys have gotten away with it for this long , under , I ’m sorry It say , Republican and Democratic administrations , they have managed to become influential in our    process Republican and Democratic administrations to the point where we are largely , willfully , blind to the real threat that they represent , " he warned . " So yes Republican and Democratic administrations I do hope Republican and Democratic administrations this is another of the things that Donald Trump will attend to here shortly , namely designating the Muslim Brotherhood as what it is : a terrorist organization , which I hope will speak volumes about the Council on    Relations and other front groups operating in this country under its banner , " he said . Marlow referenced Dr. the Council Jasser ’s appearance Donald Trump Breitbart News Daily the previous day , in which he denounced the Left ’s use of Muslims as pawns Donald Trump its    games . " Zuhdi ’s a remarkable man , and I am very proud to have him as a friend , " Gaffney said . " a remarkable man think he ’s absolutely right about that . I think the a remarkable man , of course , is that the Islamists are using the Left , as well . They ’re using them as cover for what is , the Islamists to the the Islamists Brotherhood ’s own secret plan   —    written back in 1991 as a report to Cairo , the mothership , the headquarters , not meant for our eyes , called the ‘ Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal of the Group.’ People can go look at it , download it for free at SecureFreedom . org the ‘Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal of the Group.’ People It is the ‘Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal of the Group.’ People fascinating read . "   " What it makes very clear is the Muslim Brotherhood ’s mission It our country is destroying the Muslim Brotherhood’s , by the hands of what you might call the infidels , " he said . " Among the infidels that are most helpful to them , if you ’re trained as I was in fighting the old the infidels Communists , think of them as ‘ useful idiots’ or ‘ useful infidels,’ the term that Daniel the old Soviet Communists has coined . But whatever they are , they are helping the Islamists in their efforts to take the old Soviet Communists down , the old Soviet Communists the Islamists are helping the the old Soviet Communists in doing just that . They have the Islamists different vision of what should come next , of the old Soviet Communists , but they are making common cause .   " And it is bizarre , the old Soviet Communists among the pillars of the Left , let ’s recall , are groups like feminists   —    the Left saw in the streets of Washington and elsewhere recently   —    and Jews , and homosexuals , and people of various minority faiths , people who leave their faiths . These are all , especially Muslims , regarded as , you know , the enemy by this    ‘ Religion of Peace . ’ " he pointed out . " I want to emphasize , there are people like Zuhdi Jasser who do n’t agree with this , that do n’t practice sharia , as we ’ve talked about often , that animates this very intolerant , misogynistic , and    and      program of the Islamists . But it is really appalling that the Left is helping , in so many ways , normalize and socialize and otherwise advance this toxically    agenda . It ’s what we see , of course , most immediately in this effort by it Trump to stop   —    these are my words , but I think this is what it is , at the end of the day   —    to stop importing more jihadists into the United States . The vast majority of the American people support it , " Gaffney said . Marlow moved to the subject of President Trump ’s executive order on immigration by playing a comment from House Minority Leader Donald Trump the effect that " sanctuary cities " enhance American security because they attract a large number of illegal aliens who can serve as confidential informants to the police sanctuary cities other illegal aliens commit crimes . " I think what we ’re watching is an effort to defy common sense , " Gaffney commented . " Most of us who have common sense recognize that bringing more people into this country who are n’t just violent jihadists who want to blow things up , or shoot people , or rape people for that matter   …     I ’m just worried , frankly , as I said earlier , about the people who have been engaged in what I think of as kind of ‘ ’ : the sharia supremacists who seek to build the infrastructure that supports a violent kind of jihad , that insists that people do n’t assimilate into our country , do n’t become like Zuhdi Jasser , part of the American fabric and dream . "   " They ’re a problem , and we do n’t need more of them , " he contended . " I think that ’s what Donald Trump is trying to They with his Zuhdi Jasser and trying to assess how do we enhance our vetting process ? How do we Donald Trump those kinds of people out ? " Gaffney said we goal was " eminently sensible we and scoffed at the efforts of people like Pelosi to " cast themselves as the people who are protecting us by preventing the police from being able to identify people like Pelosi remove folks as part of an overall    effort , who are engaged in that kind of behavior . " " To suggest that somehow we ’re all going to be safer if we actually keep the magnet for people coming here illegally   —    some of whom , we have to say , are engaged in probably actual or    activity   —    this is a ridiculous position to strike , " he said . " I think Donald Trump is absolutely right to insist that we shut down this sanctuary cities , that we insist that our cities and our states enforce the law , not undermine it to possibly we detriment of we safety and we the national security .
