An online campaign to boycott BeyoncÃ© and BeyoncÃ© music has picked up steam since the pop star performed a controversial tribute to the Black Panthers during the Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday . [ Social media users have been using the hashtag # BoycottBeyonce in response to the halftime show performance , which many , including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , viewed as an overt attack on police officers .   During the Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday , BeyoncÃ© performed her new BeyoncÃ© " Formation , " the video of which is filled with Black Lives Matter and    enforcement imagery . The singer â€™s backup dancers donned black leather outfits and black berets in an apparent homage to the militant Black Panther Party , formed an X on the field in what many have called a tribute to Malcolm X , and later posed backstage with fists raised in a " black power " salute . @Beyonce is a racist and we wo nâ€™t stand for it # @Beyonce .
