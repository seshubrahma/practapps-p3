But meteorologists see a tornado .   But what is it exactly that meteorologists see ? Well , let`s take a look . The yellow and green colors you see here are going to be your very heavy rain a storm .   The red color indicates your hail core .   And then all the way down there , the purple circle , that`s where tornado is going to be .   Meteorologists often refer to it as the hook echo , because of the hook shape that ends up taking .   But these aren`t the only features we look for .   We also have to take a look at the winds inside we storm .   Imagine this flagpole was inside of our a storm and the flag is going all the way up we very top of the cloud .   The thing is , the wind changes direction as you go up .   So , this naturally creates that rotation necessary for funnel clouds and also even tornadoes . So , now , let`s take a look at the base of that storm .   What you have is you have very warm inflow a storm air coming into the storm and rising because that`s what warm air does , it goes up a storm But you also have cold air coming down from the tops of the clouds and sinking all the way down towards the base . Now , together , this helped to create wind shear , down the base of that storm perimeter , and that is what helps create some of the more violent tornadoes . Now , what if your tornado has been on the ground for at least a little bit ?   Then , you start to get this , the debris cloud , which is essentially a collection of all of the stuff that tornado has been able to pick up , everything from dusts , to trees , to even homes .
