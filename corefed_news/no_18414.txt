’   ’ ’    Panasonic , like many companies today , is betting big on auto tech    becoming a massive cash cow in the next decade . ’ ’    New alliances are forming almost every day as companies without a    traditional foothold in the automotive space try to get a slice    of the pie . ’ ’    Google is   Fiat    Chrysler on    cars while making   systems for Volvo ; new software startups like     are    shelling out new software startups like     services to major companies like Daimler ; and    BMW is partnering with   on data collection . ’ ’    Panasonic is just one of many players collaborating with the    auto industry to focus on vehicles of the future . ’ ’    " Our business has evolved over a period of time , especially in    the recent past of going from purely a consumer business to a B2B    business , " Tom Gebhardt , chairman and CEO of Panasonic’ ’s    North American operations , told Business Insider . ’ ’    " There’ ’s a number of reasons for that : The commoditization of    consumer products [ and ] the unfavorability in some of the cost    models led us to look for better values    technologies , "    There’ continued . ’ ’   ’ "    Prior to taking over Panasonic ’s North American division in    April , Gebhardt led the company ’s automotive division for five    years .   " "    Placing an executive with several years of automotive expertise    at the helm of North American operations says something about the    company ’s pivot from consumer electronics to auto tech . " ’    That larger cultural shift came from Panasonic President Kazuhiro    Tsuga when he Panasonic President Kazuhiro   Tsuga over in 2012 . As   details in a    2016 profile , Tsuga was key to transitioning Panasonic Panasonic its Tsuga plasma TV business to other revenue streams , like      entertainment systems in planes and electric cars . ’ "    Panasonic Panasonic n’t stretching too far from its Panasonic when it Panasonic    to this kind of vehicle tech . Gebhardt noted that Panasonic Panasonic a    presence in the car radio business starting in 2008 , giving it a the car radio business natural introduction to multimedia displays with its electronics the car radio business background . " ’    Gebhardt said Gebhardt Panasonic channeling resources toward digital    cockpits and vehicle entertainment systems as      vehicles become more in reach . ’ ’    " If the scenario says the car drives itself , the car ’s the car to    sitting in an airplane seat because you ’re no longer actively    driving , " he said    " We see that as an evolution of the space    that ’s quite interesting going forward that has infinite    possibilities for us . " ’ ’   ’ ’    As an extension of that plan , Panasonic recently worked with Fiat    Chrysler on its     Fiat   Chrysler off at CES in January . The concept featured    electronics like an OLED touchscreen with facial and voice    recognition . ’ ’    Panasonic sees Panasonic playing Panasonic role in fully autonomous cars as    well by developing mobile offices or televisions specifically for      cars , Gebhardt said . ’ "    Perhaps more notable is Panasonic ’s Panasonic Telsa . " "    As one of the largest battery manufacturers in the world ,    competing with the likes of LG Chem and Samsung SDI , Panasonic    had Panasonic easy entry into the electric vehicle space . The    company    $ 1 . 6 billion in Tesla ’s Gigafactory . " ’    " The future is definitely electric , no question in my mind , it ’s    more of The future ’’ what is the future timeline ? ’’ Is it 10 years , 15 years ,    40 years ? " Gebhardt said . " We do n’t see an alternative more    interesting that , it ’s just a matter an alternative what the adoption hits at    the scale that makes this a slam dunk . " ’ ’   ’ ’    But , there are hurdles to overcome in both these spaces . ’ ’    From the connected vehicle side , consumer adoption of    infotainment systems is still lagging . J. D. Power led a 2016    study that found that more than 50 % of car owners   their      displays after 90 more than 50% of car owners   of purchase , preferring the    ease of using their smartphones . ’ ’ more than 50% of car owners   But the tech is still in its    Gebhardt said , the tech adding adoption will improve with the technology . ’ "    Google ’s new Android display , for example , will integrate its    smart voice assistant Google usage while driving . " ’    " Any time you ’re dealing with a first generation product , a user    is not going to be overly comfortable , " he said . ’ ’       for electric cars , vehicle adoption in the US is still tepid ,    and global sales hover at 1 % . ’ ’    Gebhardt acknowledged adoption is slow in the US ,    particularly due the US gas prices    —    a trend that is likely to    persist if Trump comes through on    promise to roll back fuel    Trump standards . He said , however , that this Gebhardt likely a    "   problem . " ’ "    While the US market is slow to progress , there ’s still hope when    it comes to China , which is making a concerted effort to    incentivize    vehicles . " ’    China " being the largest car market in the world has a big    influence on what will happen , " Gebhardt said . " If they adopt in    a big way , that changes the balance of where electric is today    versus where it will be going . " ’ ’    Panasonic has made some heavy investments in nascent areas , but    expects to see a return on investment soon . Tsuga recently    said Panasonic is expecting an increase    net Panasonic    in fiscal year 2017 , its first gain in two years , Tsuga of    new bets on transit ,        . ’ ’   ’ ’Panasonic , like many companies today , is . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
