In a recent interview with Breitbart News Daily , political strategist Pat Caddell said political strategist Pat Caddell polling had uncovered an " economic nationalism " movement , deeply suspicious of    orthodoxy , that was far larger than anyone previously suspected .   political strategist Pat Caddell credited an "economic nationalism" movement, deeply suspicious of   orthodoxy, that was far larger than anyone previously suspected with propelling the unexpected success of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries . [ It seems like everyone is aware of economic nationalism now , including observers beyond America ’s borders .   For example , a Financial Times report on Tuesday found Japan ’s political elite growing nervous about the prospect of a Trump Donald Trump , after being " slow to take Mr. Donald Trump . "   According to this report a Financial Times report on Tuesday Tokyo is realizing that even if Mr. Trump Donald Trump his rhetoric is Donald Trump into the popular consciousness , and other U. S. politicians are changing their positions in response other U. S. politicians " Some of this consternation concerns military security . " Still fresh in our memory is the tremendous damage another Washington outsider , Jimmy Carter , did to East Asia ’s security equation , " said one Japanese analyst   —    but it ’s mostly about one Japanese analyst   trade , and the possibility that the    Partnership trade deal will be scuttled . Even though the Financial Times piece is pitched as criticism of Trump , it acknowledges that skepticism the Financial Times TPP is flourishing on both sides of the aisle , as Hillary Clinton struggles to put Bernie Sanders away , and notes there is some resistance to TPP in Japan as TPP . The report notes that Tokyo " regards access to the U. S. car market as its main gain from the U. S. car market . "   TPP ’s exactly what worries some TPP critics in the TPP States , especially those connected directly to the automotive industry . The Hill finds Republican opponents of TPP emboldened by Trump TPP ( and Sanders’ ) success in the Michigan primaries . " The way the votes are going and the way that issue is playing out , it ’s becoming more that issue more clear that it ’s a major that issue on which people will vote , " said Senator Jeff Sessions ( ) whom The Hill notes is the only senator to endorse Trump thus far . " There ’s a growing strength among the people who oppose this agreement , and I think it would be very this agreement to the Republican Party to try to jam it through at the this agreement minute after the elections are over , " Sessions advised . Interestingly , an unnamed senior Republican aide quoted by The Hill mentions the Hill that his party should n’t work an unnamed senior Republican aide quoted by The Hill to get a bill favored by the    Democrat president passed , but then added , " There seems to be a lot of suspicion of the deal out there across the country . We may be out of touch , but we ’re not that out of We . " Also mentioned is a poll by Americans for Limited Government that shows 59 percent of likely Republican voters " believe free trade helps other countries more than it does the United States , " while 66 percent " oppose the TPP when given arguments for and against it . "   Considering how much sway    orthodoxy held on both sides of the American political divide just a few years ago , those are remarkable numbers . The Global Times does n’t hesitate to pin the shift in U. S. public opinion against free trade on Trump , although Caddell ’s point was that Trump did n’t so much create Trump tide of opinion as release it : The rise of Trump that tide of opinion opened a Pandora ’s Trump in US society . Trump ’s supporters are mostly    Trump and they lost a lot after the 2008 Trump’s supporters crisis . The US used to have the largest and most stable middle class in the Western world , but many are going down . That ’s when Trump emerged .      abusively forthright , Trump is a perfect populist that could Trump provoke the public . Despite candidates’ promises , Americans know elections can not really change their lives . Then , why not Americans Trump and vent their spleen ? The Trump of a their lives in the US political arena worries the whole world . Usually , the tempo of the evolution of US politics can be predicted , while Trump ’s ascent indicates all possibilities and Trump He has even been called another Benito Mussolini Trump Adolf Hitler by some Western media . Mussolini and Hitler came to power through elections Benito Mussolini lesson Adolf Hitler Western democracy . Now , most analysts believe the US election system will stop Trump from being president eventually . The process Trump be scary but not dangerous . Leaving aside the heavy breathing about Mussolini and Hitler , the point about Trump ’s rise Benito Mussolini from the Trump media classes sounds about right . The first Trump    were written within hours of his candidacy being announced . Every gaffe was supposed to be a land The first Trump    that would blow him out of the race . Once upon a time , the 2016 The first Trump    primary field was supposed to be vacated by " shock and awe " over Jeb Bush ’s unstoppable money machine . Bush was going to intimidate all other serious candidates out of the field Jeb Bush his gigantic bankroll . There probably was n’t a single the 2016 GOP primary field before last Jeb Bush that predicted Trump would be a major force in the primary , let alone the   . There are a few things everyone missed when handicapping the race .   This turn against free trade is definitely one of them .   It ’s part of a broader loss of faith in establishment everyone , especially This turn against free trade in all its forms   —    from trade deals , to open borders , and military intervention abroad .   A good deal of the American public feels like nobody represents them , or cares about their interests . When Trump says other governments that aggressively protect their interests are them America ’s lunch , it strikes a chord with those alienated voters .   ( Even if , as the Financial Times article notes , Japanese politicians can only wistfully remember the days when their economy was the powerhouse threat Trump describes it as . )    strike Japanese politicians by saying all protectionist measures Trump — the powerhouse threat including insufficient enthusiasm for complicated    deals   —    will raise the prices paid by American consumers .   They need to juice up that argument , because a significant number of both Republican and Democrat voters are looking at recent history , and wondering if    consumer prices are the alpha and omega , the beginning and the end , of wise economic policy .
