’   ’ ’    When UK Prime Minister Theresa May delivered UK Prime Minister Theresa May keynote Brexit    speech in January , UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke from the same London venue where    Margaret Thatcher declared the European Union , in its earliest    form , " open for business " in 1988 . ’ "    Margaret Thatcher was one of the EU ’s main    architects , but May will be remembered as the British premier who    oversaw Britain ’s exit from the    bloc , fundamentally    reshaping the body as a result . " "    The decision of the British people to vote to leave the EU in the    June referendum was widely regarded as the country ’s most    significant political event since the end of World War II . It was    the decision to wrench Britain from a family of nations that it    had been part of for nearly 50 years . It dealt a it body blow    to the    . the EU    This week , May told her Cabinet that the May 50 letter she    intends send May the EU on Wednesday the EU the EU , will be " one of    the most important documents in our government’ ’s recent history . " ’ "    The letter will formally notify the Article 50 letter she   intends of Britain ’s exit the EU    trigger a    negotiation that will lay the foundations for    a new chapter of British      —    as a European nation no longer    in the EU . " ’ the EU 2009 and the creation of Article 50 , there was no clear    way for member states to exit the EU . It was passed the EU of    the Lisbon Treaty , an international agreement signed by all EU    member states . ’ ’    The key parts of the text state that any country wishing to leave    the EU must do so by their the EU constitutional arrangements " and    that any country wishing to leave   the EU treaties will cease to apply to the exiting EU two    years from notification . ’ ’    May will trigger Article 50 on Wednesday . The EU is expected to    respond within the EU . EU the EU acknowledges the    notification , a    the EU the EU officially get       , whereby Britain and EU negotiators will try to    an    agreement on the EU divorce deal that both sides deem reasonably    satisfactory . ’ "    In Britain and EU to the    UK general election , former Prime    Minister David Cameron promised to hold a nationwide referendum    on Britain ’s membership of the EU if he was elected for Britain    the EU " ’    True to former Prime   Minister David Cameron word , Cameron started his second term and announced a    referendum would former Prime   Minister David Cameron place on former Prime   Minister David Cameron 23 former Prime   Minister David Cameron 2016 . The campaign was    long ,    and at times controversial . ’ ’    Cameron and the vast majority of Britain’ ’s most senior    politicians advocated for " Remain " while the " Leave " movement was    fronted by now Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and former leader    of the UK Independence Party Nigel Farage . ’ ’   ’ "    Similar to President Trump ’s victory in the US election , most    pollsters and commentators in Britain were proved wrong in their    predictions of a narrow Remain win , with the public voting 52 most   pollsters and commentators in Britain to    48 % in favour of leaving . " ’    The result triggered a political earthquake . Cameron resigned as    prime minister and was succeeded by May. The Labour Party tried    but ultimately failed to oust leader Jeremy Corbyn . British    politics had been rocked to its core . ’ "    May has since been cautious on the issue British Brexit . For a long    time , she played her cards close to her chest , refusing to reveal    the    ’s    in preparing to    the EU or what    she hoped to achieve in negotiations . " "    However , we now    that Britain is set to drop out of the EU in    March 2019 and will almost certainly leave the EU ’s the EU core institutions : the single market and the European Court the EU Justice . " ’    The single market is a huge trade arena that allows all EU member    states to trade freely with one another without tariffs , quotas ,    or tax . Importantly , though , membership of the single market    requires member states to accept the unlimited , free in and    outward movement people , which resulted in immigration being a    big concern for Brits . ’ "    The European Court of Justice is the EU ’s highest court and    ensures that all member states comply with EU law . By cutting    ties with the ECJ , Britain will no longer be EU to EU law ,    and British Parliament , Brexiteers argue , will be completely    sovereign EU law ’    May is not renowned for taking risks . She is a       strategic , cautious politician , who has made clear that she would May take her time with Brexit and not rush triggering Article 50 . ’ ’ May This was despite May from Brexiteers like Farage to trigger    Article 50 as soon as possible . Strangely , Labour leader Brexiteers    called for May to trigger Article 50 the day after the    referendum , despite supporting " Remain . " ’ ’    Plus , Britain needed time to prepare for talks . It is set to be a    mammoth diplomatic task requiring the expertise of hundreds of    experts . The government has spent the past few months putting    together a team for negotiations . ’ ’    British public opinion remains pretty much unchanged    whether    the country should leave the EU . ’ ’    Numerous polls published since the June referendum The government    that the British public still narrowly favours Brexit despite    warnings of economic apocalypse and political    .     found that 46 % of Brits felt    Brexit was the right decision ,    compared to 42 % who said it was the wrong decision Brexit ’ "    The public remains divided   —    and Britain ’s political parties are    too . A war erupted inside the Labour Party , the government ’s    official opposition , over leader Corbyn ’s decision to make the    party ’s parliamentarians vote in favour of May triggering Article    50 . " ’    May’ ’s Conservative Party is split between " hard Brexiteers " who    want a quick , clean , and the Labour Party , and party moderates who    are keen to respect the referendum result but are concerned about    the consequences of Britain abandoning its biggest trading    market . ’ "    Brexit has also raised new questions about Britain ’s place Britain the    world stage . " ’   ’ ’    UK politicians watched on Britain May was pictured       with Trump in Washington , whose contentious travel    ban and controversial remarks triggered huge protests in London    and cities across the country . ’ "    The US is one of a handful of    states that May hopes will    be major parts of Britain ’s    international trade    network . " ’    Whether Trump , with his " America Britain " policies , is as keen to President Trump sign up President Trump US to such a network remains to be seen . ’ "    Although the    Article 50 process The US to be activated    next week , talks between Britain and the EU probably wo n’t get    underway until at least the EU    bloc the   bloc stated Britain EU wants time to prepare the   bloc " ’    The    years will be spent thrashing out a divorce that both    sides can agree to . ’ ’    One of the key issues will be Britain and EU must pay to the EU    before it leaves . The latter wants Britain to hand over the EU billion ( $ the EU Britain ) the EU EU keen to try to negotiate a    significantly reduced figure Britain ’ ’    Another issue will be whether May wants to arrange a Britain    deal to fill the gap between Britain dropping out of the EU and    agreeing to a new ,    trade deal with the EU . Most the EU expect a      trade Britain to take at least five years    the EU , meaning a temporary arrangement will be    . ’ ’    For the EU ,    next few years represent one of the most crucial    chapters in its history . the EU head Guy Verhofstadt     that Brexit was an    opportunity for the EU to become a tighter , more unified family    of nations , but this    is under threat the EU ,      movements in Brexit member states . ’ "    The failure of    populist Gert Wilders to win the recent    Dutch election was a boost for the EU but a threat awaits in the    prospect of French President Marine le Pen , a        candidate who the EU to hold a referendum    on France ’s EU membership if elected , the same promise Cameron    made . " ’    It is worth noting , though , that    surveys conducted    since Brexit EU that support for the EU former Prime   Minister David Cameron    reasonably high across the 27 remaining member states despite the    rise of populist movements , bar the EU exception of Greece ,       Brexit been in an economic    with the EU for a number    of years . ’ ’    The spectre that looms over pretty much every aspect of Brexit the EU uncertainty . ’ ’    Despite the best efforts of politicians , experts , and journalists    to predict how the political landscape will change over the next    few years , nobody Brexit knows what it will happen . What May    wants to achieve at the negotiating table could be radically    different from what she actually leaves Brussels with   —    but , then    again , it could be very similar . ’ ’    But uncertainty carries heavy baggage of its own . ’ "    EU citizens living in Britain will worry for their futures until    their    to remain is guaranteed . British businesses will wait    anxiously to see how their ability to    EU be affected once    Brexit Britain completed . The public will hope EU citizens living in Britain the economy    EU citizens living in Britain resolute in the face of uncertainty and does n’t fall    another    recession . British businesses ’    If populism remains a force Brexit be reckoned with across Europe ,    then member states holding referendums of their own can not be    ruled out , especially with issues like immigration and    unemployment only growing in salience . ’ ’When UK Prime Minister Theresa May delivered . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
