On Friday ’s broadcast of MSNBC ’s " All In , " MSNBC anchor Joy Reid argued that the " bread and circuses " for President Trump ’s base , " includes the persecution of people they fear , the persecution of Muslims is part of the bread and circuses , the persecution of the immigrants , throwing out DREAMers from the country , people that it ’s easy for his base to hate and to fear . "   Reid said , " [ T]he most cynical thing his ’s done so far , is to say , I have to ban people from these seven Muslim countries . it ’s urgent . I ’ve got to do it now . And then , when it gets rejected by the courts , the 2nd version of this ban , actually can wait because his ’s getting lauded by the press . And so , while his ’s being applauded , it ’s not so urgent . it can wait now . " She added , " [ T]he bread and circuses for his base includes the persecution of people they fear , the persecution of Muslims is part of the bread and circuses , the persecution of the immigrants , throwing out DREAMers from the country , people that it ’s easy for his base to hate and to fear . That is part of the show his gives them instead of giving them them things like , I do n’t know , health care . " (   Grabien ) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
