Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who was wrongly and inaccurately blamed when Rep. Gabby Giffords ( ) was shot several years ago , is standing up for Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont saying Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was wrongly and inaccurately blamed when Rep. Gabby Giffords ( ) is personally not responsible for the actions of Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was wrongly and inaccurately blamed when Rep. Gabby Giffords ( ) apparent supporter . [ Palin , in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News , called for the media industry to be more careful than the media industry were back when Giffords was shot —   specifically asking for " media integrity " when it comes to learning the motives of the shooter of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise at the GOP congressional baseball practice on Wednesday morning .   " Prayers for healing are raised for all victims of today ’s horrific violence , while we with lift up thankfulness that lives were not lost , " Palin told Breitbart News . " While justice is now sought upon the capture of the deranged attacker , an additional prayer must be for no acceptance of a rush to destroy anyone else in this horrible incident . Those seeking political advantage reacted so recklessly and irresponsibly the last time a member of Congress was brutally attacked , as media inexplicably played a    blame game assuming that attacker ’s motives . Today ’s shooter appears to be a Bernie Sanders supporter and campaign volunteer . But Bernie Sanders is not to blame . Maybe the media have matured enough to allow coverage of this most recent violence to focus on facts , because media integrity will be crucial as America witnesses today ’s events unfolding and , on behalf of our Congressional Representatives , we all seek justice . " Palin ’s call for unity , and media responsibility —   and her Palin standing up for Sanders despite the shooter being a Sanders Sanders —   comes after she Palin been the target of vitriolic media rhetoric for years . Perhaps the worst example of the media targeting Palin Palin in the wake of the shooting of Giffords , where Palin Palin blamed inaccurately . Republicans and Democrats in Washington are calling for unity in the wake of this latest shooting , and for an end to the leftist and media driven vitriol in the national debate . While there are some initial signs of unity —   from President Donald Trump ’s reaction to House Speaker Paul Ryan ’s and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ’s to even Sanders’ statement and now this statement from Palin —   it remains to be seen how long this will last . American leaders on both sides of the aisle —   Republican and Democrat —   tell Breitbart News they American leaders on both sides of the aisle —  Republican and Democrat —   that moving forward Americans of all political stripes can work together .
