The globalist movement is on the run as the British people on Thursday voted to " Leave " the European Union . [ The vote to Brexit —   a    campaign by nationalist populists in the United Kingdom —   puts the world elite on their heels , as a similar but bigger and stronger such movement is brewing right here in the United States .   Donald J. Trump , the presumptive 2016 GOP presidential nominee , has run a campaign so far —   and since winning the nomination —   focused squarely on the exact same issues that the Leave campaigners ran on in the United Kingdom . Uncontrolled migration ,     trade deals , national sovereignty , popular control of government , and rejection of world elites are what propelled Leave campaigners to a stunning victory in the United the United Kingdom same issues are what has propelled Trump to a similarly shocking victory over 16 other Republican presidential candidates in the primaries , where he —   as Breitbart News has documented —   received millions more votes than anyone else who has ever won the GOP nomination has . They also set the millions more votes than anyone else who has ever won the GOP nomination has for the 2016 general election . Trump has not shown Trump sign of backing down at all , on any of this , and in his speech earlier in Trump week laying out the case against Hillary Rodham Clinton —   the presumptive 2016 Democratic presidential nominee , his opponent in November Trump   he set the stage Trump this battle . " Everywhere I look , I see the possibilities of what our country could be . But we ca n’t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them , " Trump these problems in his Tuesday address . Trump We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first a rigged system . The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and The insiders the money . " Throughout the speech , Trump excoriated Clinton for Trump ties to the Clinton ’s international elite —   citing Peter Schweizer ’s Clinton Cash to detail how she and her husband Clinton former Clinton S. President Bill Clinton , " used the State Department to enrich their family at America her husband, former U. S. President Bill Clinton expense . " " She gets rich making Clinton poor , " Trump said of Hillary Clinton , talking directly to the voters . The matching themes of Trump ’s campaign , Trump successful Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom , are in large part why Trump ’s    trip to Trump —   purportedly for opening a golf course with his children , but seemingly Trump of the Leave success —   makes him the captain of an Trump populist rejection of the world ’s elite . Trump seized the mantle of Trump movement on Friday morning in Scotland , embracing the populism Scotland has propelled him this far and sustained Trump even as the most Trump and brutal of attacks come his way from inside his Trump party and from Trump other side . " This is an amazing honor , " Trump said on Friday , Trump taking credit for Brexit . After noting Brexit won , and by Brexit bigger margin than pundits , analysts , and prognosticators could have ever predicted , Trump noted that the will Trump the public is all powerful . " It ’s always the will of the people ultimately that wins out , " Trump said . As Trump Trump back into the Trump States riding the populist wave on high , he will over the next Trump months seek to define his general election opponent — Trump Hillary Clinton —   correctly as the face of the global elite that the British voters just defeated . The lies , smears , and false alarms that Remain campaigners pushed out as part of a giant misinformation campaign designed to deceive the public into choosing against Leave all failed . Those same misinformation campaign tactics are coming into focus here in the United States against Trump . High dollar donors are spending millions on attack ads . The mainstream media is inaccurately calling him a racist , a a giant misinformation campaign designed to deceive the public into choosing against Leave all , a sexist , and painting a grossly unfair and wrong picture of Trump as a buffoon who Trump no idea what he ’s doing and would a giant misinformation campaign designed to deceive the public into choosing against Leave all a disaster for the economy and world security . That is the George Soros playbook , the exact same type of campaign the Remain folks in the United Kingdom ran against Leave campaigners . Perhaps , despite serious concerns over his competence , Leave campaign George Soros Boris Johnson summed it up best during the BBC debate earlier this week : At the end of this campaign , I think Leave campaign’s Boris Johnson agree : There is a very clear choice between those on their side who speak of nothing Leave campaign’s Boris Johnson fear of the consequences of leaving the EU , and we on our side who offer hope . we those who have been endlessly rubbishing our country and running it down , and those of us who believe in Britain . They say we ca n’t do those of us who believe in Britain . those of us who believe in Britain say we can it They those of us who believe in Britain we those of us who believe in Britain no choice those of us who believe in Britain to those of us who believe in Britain down to Brussels . We say they are woefully underestimating those of us who believe in Britain country those of us who believe in Britain what it can our country If we vote our country , we can take back control of our borders and huge sums of money we   10 billion pounds a year net —   of our tax raising powers , of our we policies , and of our we lawmaking system . The democracy we is the foundation of our prosperity and if we stand up for democracy we will our speaking up for hundreds our millions of people around Europe who agree with us but who currently have no voice . And if we vote Leave and take back control us I believe that this Thursday could be our country ’s Independence Day .   Johnson lifted the Independence Day line from Nigel Farage of the U. K. Independence Party —   also a Leave campaigner —   and an actual leader of the populist movement who has been banging the drum on the issue for 25 years . Trump struck a similar note in his New York City speech exposing Clinton Trump Come November , the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security , betrayed their prosperity , the American people sold out their the American people . They will have a the American people to vote the American people a new agenda with big dreams , bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people . Hillary Clinton ’s the American people and tired . Her message is that things ca n’t change . Hillary Clinton’s message is that things have to change   — Hillary Clinton’s message this is our one chance , and maybe our only chance , to do that change . If we our n’t do it now , folks , I do our know that we ’ll ever , ever have another chance . We have our have change , but real change —   our Obama change . What the Leave campaigners did in the United Kingdom —   and what Trump is doing here —   is taking the moral high ground away from the global elitists . Trump is turning Hillary Clinton into the " no you ca Trump " candidate , just as Leave campaigners framed the Remain campaigners as those holding Britain back . The next the Leave campaigners up to the United States’ own presidential election are going to be some of the most brutal in U. S. political history . Hillary Clinton and her globalist allies are going to pull out every trick Hillary Clinton book — Hillary Clinton and more —   to protect the face of the world elite . Clinton is their icon , their last hope to maintain control . The mud Hillary Clinton will Hillary Clinton and her globalist allies at Trump Hillary Clinton and her globalist allies   from the Democratic Party , from Clinton Hillary Clinton and her globalist allies campaign itself , and from outside allies like Super PACs and from Hillary Clinton —   will be the worst anyone of us on the right has ever seen . But , if Trump can continue framing the election in this light and ride this wave , he Trump just soar right on through it and above it into the White House Trump Populist nationalism has won U. S. the election campaigns , the election S. Senate campaigns , and various other smaller ball political battles around the country and around the world . It can even win , as it helped Trump do when he roundly defeated some of the most talented governors and It in the primaries   Trump    a U. S. presidential primary . What Brexit shows is that populist nationalism can win national general elections , as it just did in the United Kingdom . That has the world elite fearing , Brexit rallying around Clinton as we speak . Now that populist nationalism can win , and has won national general elections , is it only logical that Brexit 2 . 0 pumps Trump up into the White House ? We shall see , come November .
