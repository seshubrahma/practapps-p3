"   Sessions said , " First , about the comments that I made to the committee that have been said to be incorrect and false . Let me be clear , I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign , and the idea that I was part of a , quote , ‘ continuing exchange of information , during the Trump campaign , between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government’ is totally false . That is the question that Senator [ Al ] Franken ( ) asked me at the hearing , and that ’s what got my attention , as he Senator [Al] Franken ( ) it my attention —    noted , it was the first   —    just breaking news , and it it my my attention and that is the question I responded to . I did not respond by referring to the two meetings , one very brief after a speech , and one with two of my senior staffers , professional staffers , with the Russian ambassador in Washington , where no such things were discussed . In my reply to the question   —    my reply to the question of Senator Franken was honest and correct as I understood it at the question of Senator Franken time . I appreciate that some have taken the view that this was a false comment . That is not my intent . That is not correct . I will write the Judiciary Committee soon , today or tomorrow , to explain this testimony for the record . " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
