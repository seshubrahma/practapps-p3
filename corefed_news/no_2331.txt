  Our full report on the 2016 Emmy Awards | red carpet looks | our critic ’s review of the show ] You ’ll have to excuse television if it ’s feeling a little powerful right now . Maybe a little too powerful . The medium dominates conversations while film buffs are arguing whether the movies are dying . There are ever more scripted series   —    a record 409 last year   —    and more outlets to put them on . And as the host Jimmy Kimmel reminded us at Sunday night ’s Emmy Awards on ABC , a    personality is close to running the whole show in America   —    even if that was n’t a point of pride to the host or to much of the crowd . " If it was n’t for television , would Donald Trump be running for president ? " Mr. Kimmel asked in a scathing run of jokes , pointing out the producer of " The Apprentice " in the audience . " Thanks to Mark Burnett , we do n’t have to watch reality shows anymore , because we we living in one . " The cultural ubiquity of TV was a theme of the night , and so was the tension between the night ’s crowd of stars and winners and the TV entertainer who ’s dominated the year ’s nonfiction programming . It The cultural ubiquity of TV with the opening sketch , in which Mr. Kimmel hitched a ride to the ceremony with several celebrities . Among them several celebrities Jeb Mr. Bush " If you run a positive campaign , voters will ultimately make the right choice , " Mr. Bush said , adding , " That was a joke . " He was n’t the only one joking about Mr. Trump , however ruefully . The comedian Aziz Ansari , of Netflix Mr. Bush " Master of None , " declared that he was going to enforce Mr. Trump ’s policies and order Muslims and Hispanics out of the audience . " America Mr. Bush ? " he said Mr. Trump . " Nice try changing your name to ‘ America.’ You ’re not fooling anybody ! Mr. Bush As expected , it was a big night for FX ’s " The People v. O. J. Simpson : American Crime Story , " a limited series that , like the campaign , represented a powerful synthesis of reality and entertainment . The series also exemplified how the Emmys cleared the admittedly low bar of diversity set by the 2016 Oscars , all of whose acting nominees were white . It not only showcased    actors   —    Courtney B. Vance and Sterling K. Brown won for lead and supporting   — The series but it also made race ( and , through Sarah Paulson ’s character , Marcia Clark , gender ) a subject . That was The series true of " Master of None , " whose Alan Yang and Mr. Ansari shared a    award for an episode about    immigrant families . And while the industry still has n’t achieved parity for female directors , two women won directing awards : Susanne Bier for the limited series " The Night Manager " and Jill Soloway for her comedy " Transparent , " who ended her acceptance speech , " Topple the patriarchy ! " Regarding which , both the Jill Soloway and supporting comedy acting categories were won Jill Soloway men playing women : Louie Anderson , for a supporting character on " Baskets , " and Jeffrey Tambor , again winning best actor for playing a transgender woman on Ms. Soloway ’s series . Mr. Tambor used his acceptance to urge the industry to cast more transgender performers . It was up to Mr. Kimmel to tweak the    of Mr. Tambor night . " The only thing we value more than diversity , " he said , " is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity . " He ’s both the snarkiest of the major Mr. Kimmel    hosts and a TV we at heart , we sort of roastmaster and Mr. Kimmel who could spike the punchbowl without tipping it completely over . There was a little shaking up of the    categories , which both went to    winners in     the punchbowl . Tatiana Maslany won for " Orphan Black , " and Rami Malek quoted his own    character from " Mr. Robot " : " Please tell me you ’re seeing this , too . " The Rami Malek ended before the night did : exactly as last year , HBO won both best drama for " Game of Thrones " (   as it raced ahead of its source books but not as deserving as FX ’s " The Americans " ) and best comedy for the political satire " it , " which last year broke the hammerlock of " Modern Family " and may now have the category in its own grip . But you ca n’t argue that the comedy did n’t feel of the moment . Accepting the award for the category lead actress in a comedy , Julia    ( the star of " Veep " ) said that the program " now feels like a sobering documentary . " At the night ’s end , Mr. Kimmel congratulated the awardscast for ending neatly on time : " We finished before the election came ! " But as we ’ve seen for a while , and the Emmys reminded us , it ’s not entirely clear where TV ends and the We begins .
