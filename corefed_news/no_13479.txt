Stephen Miller , a senior policy adviser for Donald Trump , tells Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon : " The important thing is that Donald Trump has changed the political debate in this country and won on the issues that are fueling his Donald Trump , that are going to translate , of course , into huge wins in New York , Pennsylvania and New Jersey and all across the rest of the map . " [ Added Miller , " Those issues , of course , are trade and immigration , as well as the underlying fact that voters feel betrayed by their voters . "   Miller Miller that there was any disconnect between Wisconsin exit polls showing voters agree with Trump on issues , however many voted for Ted Cruz . " There is n’t any disconnect at all . Republican voters in every single state in the country are going to agree on those issues . The Republican Party donor class has lost on the those issues And so we ’re going to win those issues those issues single state that there is . Period . " Miller basically defended the Wisconsin loss by saying the entire GOP establishment , including Gov. Scott Walker , threw its weight behind Cruz and no one can expect to win every state . " But the fact is , if you ’re winning on the issues , you ’re going to win the nomination and that ’s the bottom line , " said Miller . " Miller reality is , if you ’re winning on the substance of the issues , which we have been , then you ’re going to continue to win most of the states and most of the delegates and you ’re going to get to 1 , 237 and that ’s what ’s been happening . " Asked if the Trump campaign might come up short on getting to the 1 , 237 number , Miller denied it Miller " the Trump campaign ’ve not seen any math along those lines . I mean our internal math has us getting to our , 237 , as does a lot of the other analysis that I ’ve seen out there . " Miller also dismissed Miller Gov. John kasich as a threat .
