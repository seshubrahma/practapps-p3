New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady , Head Coach Bill Belichick , and principle owner Robert Kraft , according to SB Nation staff writer Charlotte Wilder , by supporting New York billionaire Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign , somehow leave their fans struggling with " emotional implications " making it hard for their to watch the games and enjoy the team ’s march to a potential fifth Super Bowl victory . [ Without citing any hard evidence that the team wo n’t be supported —   like organized protests or decline in ticket sales —   Wilder instead provides some anecdotal stories about some liberal friends not being able to enjoy the games because they some liberal friends upset with Trump ’s message . She Wilder says Brady ’s facebook page was inundated by negative remarks from alleged fans .    But Wilder Wilder n’t really make a very good case that the alleged fans be bailing on Tommy and the boys . Significantly , she Wilder to point out that Boston Red Sox fans did n’t have any problems supporting conservative pitcher Curt Schilling when their team Boston Red Sox fans which sits in the hub of New England ’s liberal leaning swath of America , helped upend the    curse of the Bambino by sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series . Now Wilder contends that although Pats fans never lost faith and were able to endure    and    " recently , that blind faith has faced its greatest that blind faith in the form of the team ’s connection to Republican    Donald Trump . " Wilder , who hails from Lincoln Mass where 77 . 7 % of the population voted for the failed    ticket , argues , " The trouble began when Patriots reporters spotted Brady with a Make America Great Again hat in his locker Brady Foxboro in the fall of 2015 . " Wilder points out that the New England legend donned the hat " soon after Trump announced his candidacy and called Mexicans rapists in the same speech . " Wilder ’s bias intentionally mischaracterizes Trump ’s Trump As Breitbart News reported in June , Trump was not Trump to all Mexicans as Wilder implies but Wilder was referring to illegal aliens coming over the U. S.   border who commit additional crimes , such as rape . "   Wilder demonstrates that Wilder ’s the Wilder with the Trump problem when she calls the Wilder " one of the most divisive and    figures in the history of American politics.’   When Brady said back in 2015 that it would be " great " if his " friend Brady Trump won the election , and Trump responded by saying " Tom Brady is a great friend of mine . He ’s a Brady and he likes winners Brady " Wilder claims that shock permeated the internet . Brady never went Brady record saying who he actually voted Brady . The SB Nation writer goes on to characterize the man who will be President of the United States on January 20th as one who ran " with the most    ( and racist , misogynistic ,    Islamaphobic , etc . ) rhetoric . "   To support her case that the Patriots have a " Trump Problem , " the author cites a story that her mom told the author about one the author her friends , the author once was a    fan but can no longer watch Pats games . Wilder ’s mom said her mom She used to her every Sunday with her family , her now she just ca her do it . " Wilder called the friend Wilder after she was told her story and asked her if she her no her support the team . " Yeah , I just will not watch , " Susan Pease said :   I really enjoy watching the game with my family . I her family it means for my family to sit down her family and laugh and watch and snack and now    …      I just , it ’s just ruined for me it It ’s not the Susan Pease thing it this , of course   —    this whole thing stems from my tremendous disappointment over this election and country . But it will forever color my opinion of the team . I will not watch , I will not buy any more jerseys . I ’m done . But Pease is Susan Pease alone ,   Wilders claims " at least 6 " other people she knows ca n’t watch the Pease either . I ’m sure that will make a Susan Pease dent in the ratings for the playoff game at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough , where the Patriots will host the Houston Texans in the NFL Divisional Round on Saturday .
