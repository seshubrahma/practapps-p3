Do you approve or disapprove of this increase ? Wisconsin voters disapprove of this plan 62 percent to 25 percent in this this increase Trump needs to make the refugee issue a front and center part of the discussion about what is going wrong in the country , just like he did with trade and the economy , so that Trump can not any longer fail to mention these issues , Caddell said . Caddell , who is a Fox News Insider , said both nationally and in Wisconsin the only way Clinton wins is if she makes it a     contest Clinton her and Trump Clinton personality concerns .
