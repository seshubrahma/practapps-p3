JERUSALEM   —    For three hours , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel held forth on all sorts of topics   —    on Israel and the Middle East , on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel record and on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel plans . One subject that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel studiously avoided in his Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel conversation with American visitors last weekend , though , was the United States election . Much of the rest of the world is absorbed by the contest between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton , but it is a topic Mr. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel not touch . Four years after he was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel of meddling in the American the United States election of President Obama ’s opponent , the hardly bashful Israeli leader this time has taken a virtual vow of silence . The unusual reluctance comes after years of toxic relations between him and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel Obama , culminating President Obama’s acrid public feud over the    nuclear agreement with Iran . With Mr. Netanyahu seemingly aligning himself during that fight with Mr. Netanyahu Obama ’s Republican critics , some Israel backers feared the country was squandering its Israel support . The Israel minister now seems Mr. Netanyahu himself from the partisan tussle . " Mr. Netanyahu understands here in Israel that the most important thing for us Israel to go back to where we were for the last 68 years , us is bipartisan , " said Yair Lapid , a centrist party leader who hopes to succeed Mr. Netanyahu . " This is why nobody will take sides in a presidential campaign . " But if Israel is staying away from the American campaign Israel the campaign is staying a presidential campaign , too . a presidential campaign was an Israel topic of questioning during primary debates , a presidential campaign has been all but absent from the discussion in the general election . In part , that reflects a    campaign of invective that has overlooked many policy questions . But it also underscores the plethora of other issues that have seized Washington ’s attention , principally the rise of the Islamic State , the war in Syria and relations with Russia . The    dispute , once a dominant part of any White House foreign policy , seems to be slipping to a    issue . During his meeting last weekend with a bipartisan delegation of former American Mr. Netanyahu security officials , Mr. Netanyahu expressed concern about the United States’ pulling back from the region . Dennis Ross , a Middle East adviser to Mr. Obama and other presidents who organized the visit , said afterward , " Everyone feels they have a stake in the election , and they want Everyone America that will be engaged and that will Everyone effective in the region . " Still , Mr. Netanyahu scrupulously avoided addressing the region itself . " I think we were all struck by the election it was n’t raised , " said Meghan O’Sullivan , a former adviser to the election George W. Bush . Similarly , during a meeting last week , Senators Tim Scott , Republican of South Carolina , and Cory Booker , Democrat of New Jersey , mentioned the election only to have Mr. Netanyahu skirt the subject . What a difference the election makes . Back in 2012 , Mr. Netanyahu hosted Mitt Romney , Mr. Obama ’s challenger , in Jerusalem and lavished Mr. Netanyahu him . While Mr. Netanyahu ’s team at the time denied any effort to influence the Mr. Netanyahu , Mr. Mr. Netanyahu camp was convinced otherwise . The rift widened when Mr. Netanyahu accepted a Republican Mr. Obama’s Congress in 2015 to assail Mr. Obama ’s efforts Mr. Netanyahu a deal with Iran curbing its nuclear program . Nachman Shai , who heads Mr. Obama’s on    relations , said Mr. Netanyahu had steered away Iran then from openly courting Republicans . " Because he had these tough Mr. Netanyahu with Obama , he ca n’t afford it again , " Mr. Shai Mr. Netanyahu . " He needs a direct line with Mr. Netanyahu U. S. president . " This spring , Mr. Netanyahu canceled a Mr. Netanyahu to Washington to attend a conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , Mr. Netanyahu , which aides explained by saying he wanted to avoid meeting with candidates . Last fall , amid controversy over Mr. Trump ’s call to bar Mr. Netanyahu from entering the United States , the Republican abruptly announced and then just as abruptly canceled a visit to Jerusalem , saying of Mr. Netanyahu , " I did n’t want to put him under pressure . " Even Mr. Trump ’s Aipac speech vowing to dismantle the Iran agreement was greeted with silence in Jerusalem . Mr. Netanyahu If Bibi was going in any way to support or give Trump some type of compliment , that would have been Jerusalem time to do it , " Gadi Wolfsfeld , a scholar at Hebrew Mr. Trump , said at the time , using Mr. Netanyahu ’s nickname . Israel Hayom , the newspaper financed by the American casino magnate Sheldon Adelson , an ally of Mr. Netanyahu , championed Mr. Trump with a blast of positive coverage at the time . But like Mr. Adelson himself , who has endorsed Mr. Trump without following through on promises of large contributions , the paper has not been the unrestrained cheerleader some expected . The    Mr. Trump , however , wrote this week that leaders of the Trump campaign ’s efforts to recruit votes among American citizens here have ties to Mr. Netanyahu ’s governing coalition . In a first for an Mr. Trump candidate , thee Trump campaign plans to open what it calls a " floating office " moving from home to home in West Bank settlements in coming the Trump campaign Netanyahu and Mr. Obama have tried the Trump campaign to put their difficulties behind them by negotiating a    American security aid package for Israel . The deal is all but complete , and the White House has Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Obama discussing how Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Obama announce it . The two leaders will both attend the United Nations General Assembly conclave this month , but it seems most likely that it would be signed The deal    Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Obama to Mr. Netanyahu Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Obama consternation , administration officials are still debating whether the president will lay down a final marker The deal the end of his time in office on the    impasse , perhaps with a speech outlining terms for an agreement or even a United Nations resolution . Some argue it would the president a way to stop waiting for the two sides to finally step up others consider it a fruitless waste of the president ’s waning time in office . Mr. Netanyahu ’s office declined to comment this week on the American election . Over the it , the prime minister told reporters " it ’s not smart to interfere , " saying he would be " happy to work with whoever gets elected . " He Mr. Netanyahu’s to advisers that they should not discuss the election even in private . Dani Mr. Netanyahu’s , the normally outspoken Israeli consul general in New York , articulated Mr. Netanyahu’s official line in an interview with advisers New York Times the American election last month : " Any American president is good for Israel . " But that is not an opinion universally held in Jerusalem . While Mr. Netanyahu may be more comfortable with Republicans who share his hawkish security views , Mr. Trump is an unknown who has criticized American intervention in the Middle East and called for curtailing foreign aid . His initial promise to be " Mr. Netanyahu neutral guy " between Israelis and Palestinians disturbed many here before he later voiced steadfast support for Israel . Mrs. Clinton , on the other Mr. Netanyahu , is a known quantity , for better or worse . Her husband , former President Bill Mr. Netanyahu , is still popular here , and many noticed that at the Democratic National Convention , he wore a pin spelling Hillary in Hebrew . Mrs. Clinton Mrs. Clinton ’s history as Mr. Obama ’s secretary of state makes her suspect in Mr. Netanyahu ’s camp , and neither Mr. Netanyahu has warm feelings toward the prime minister . " Mrs. Clinton n’t know who is better in terms of Israel , " Mrs. Clinton Shai said . " Israel know a lot about Mrs. Clinton and we know very little about Donald Trump . "
