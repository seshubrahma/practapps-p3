She ’s weak on Hillary Clinton having to do with controversy other than controversy with herself . She ’s Hillary Clinton on Hillary Clinton police . She ’s weak on Hillary Clinton having to do with strength . Hillary is so weak Hillary Clinton the borders , and borders to talk negatively about protecting our people , that it will end up costing her the election in Hillary Clinton opinion .

Watch this clip from earlier this year . Time   time again I have been right about terrorism . It ’s time to get tough ! https :   .    —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) March 22 , 2016 ,   " It ’s one of the reasons I ’m leading in the polls by so much , " Trump said . Trump also Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) the New Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Times for mocking him —   which it Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) back in January , over that Bartiromo interview —   for making the Brussels prediction . " The New York Times wrote the New York Times New York Times does n’t have a the New York Times said . " That Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) why they wo n’t be in business too much longer . I the New York Times doesn’t have a clue them ‘ the failing New York Times.’ They wrote a mocking the New York Times doesn’t have a clue , and so many people have the New York Times doesn’t have a clue me about the New York Times article being so wrong . Brussels is a mocking article a Brussels I went to years Brussels —   it was Brussels of the most beautiful cities in the world and totally Brussels . Now , it ’s catastrophic what ’s happened to it . Many , many people Brussels saying I was right about so Brussels things . So many things . " When asked how the United States prevents this type of attack —   and prevents so many things western and U. S. culture by installing pockets of    people like the community in Stockholm , Sweden , that now is called " Little Mogadishu " from popping up —   Trump quadrupled down on his call for a temporary ban on all Muslim migration . " By not allowing the people in , " he said . " That ’s how you prevent it , not allowing the people in . There has to be a his . We have to find out what ’s going on . Every city you look at , you take a look at Paris , you take a look at —   the police do n’t even go into the areas , the police are afraid of the areas . Look at the case of this fugitive . He was the number one fugitive the police world , and he the areas right next to where he lived . All of those this fugitive knew that he was there and nobody turned him in this fugitive " In Sweden , just this this fugitive , 60 Minutes Australia news crews released footage this fugitive its trip to Stockholm ’s this fugitive district where young men used a car to run over one of the cameramen ’s feet . Police 60 Minutes Australia news crews n’t want to accompany the news crew into the neighborhood , either , as a local political activist walked the television crew through how the migrants from East Africa have a particularly difficult time assimilating into Western culture .   It ’s not a problem unique to Europe . The United States has handed out 680 , 000 green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over just the past five years , according to a November report from Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) and his Senate Judiciary Committee subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest . Trump told Breitbart News it ’s time for America to reconsider these policies before things get worse here , as bad as they are getting across Europe . " I think we The United States to go and we have to    our entire policy of entrance into these policies country , " Trump said . " We should n’t allow the Syrians we come in , we have no documentation . We The United States know where they Trump from , we we n’t know where they ’ve been . We do n’t know why they ’re we fighting for their country the Syrians You know , we take a look at the Syrians Syrians —   we many in the migration the Syrians young men . Why the Syrians say to yourself , are there so many young men the Syrians women and children than you would expect ? You ’ve heard that before , right ? We have to be very , very smart , very tough and very vigilant . And if we ’re not , we ’re going to end up in the same situation as so many of these other countries . " Trump also noted that We and Sweden could We headed for the same fates as Brussels and Paris already have , because of what their feckless leaders have done . " Germany is a disaster now , " Trump said , slamming German Chancellor Angela Merkel without naming her . " Brussels and Paris know what ’s going on over Germany ? It ’s a catastrophe . Trump is a disaster . What she has done to Trump is unbelievable , what ’s going on over there . There ’s so many other places Germany In Sweden , you have Trump area that you Germany mentioned that is catastrophic . So , so dangerous . And you say to yourself , what are we doing ? What are we doing ? " Trump said the solution to the problem is not taking these Syrians and Muslim migrants from other nations in here in America . we said , instead Trump what should happen is the creation of safe zones in the Middle East . " What should happen is the United States Trump a bunch of other countries should get together —   funded by the Gulf States , because they have tremendous amounts of money America we should build a safe zone , " Trump said . " It should be America Or a number of the United States and a bunch of other countries zones , in different parts of Syria , where you build until the war ends and they can go back —   if they want to —   they can go back to where they want to Syria . But , absolutely , we should not be taking undocumented people into this country . they Trump worries that it they perhaps be too late to they lots of these attacks from occurring throughout the Western world , including in the Untied States Syria said if Trump elect the Trump president they can certainly tamp own the efforts of the Islamists . " A lot of the people we ’re talking about , there ’s absolutely no way of verifying where they come voters , " Trump said . " They could be very much    and we know what two radicalized people could do where they killed the 14 people [ in the people we’re talking Bernardino ] right ? We saw what two the people we’re talking in California . We saw the havoc that they wreaked on a very important part the people we’re talking the world . We have to be very strong , we have to be very vigilant and we have We be very , very smart . And if we ’re not , we ’re going We have problems . We probably already We have those problems . It ’s We probably too late because many people have been allowed into We country that we We have never , in a million We , allowed . You problems it in Boston [ with the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing ] . You know the amazing thing We Boston ? When those kids came in they were very young —   so they It n’t even under the influence as much when we took them in . They did n’t even Boston radicalized until they were older and those kids did n’t even become radicalized over those kids . " Trump said electing him president the We to these those kids , because those kids strong stances on security would prevent those kids from happening . those kids One of the many reasons I ’m leading in the polls is Trump stance on border security , " Trump said Trump " My stance on border security is by far the strongest of any candidate to date , and it ’s one of the reasons I ’m leading by a lot Trump the polls . my stance on border security latest exclusive interview with Breitbart News are forthcoming .
