" [ " I want to apologize , " Baher said earlier this month , the day after Baher made the controversial comments .

And look what poor Juanita’s story and our stories did to Paula . To all of our . And for Paula to call our tramps ? And then Paula comes on the next day with this totally insincere apology basically covering Paula and ABC . It just did n’t meet my standards whatsoever . I mean It was the worst excuse for an apology that I had ever heard in my life . Paula should be totally ashamed of Paula . That was no apology whatsoever . Baher made the remarks in question during a discussion about Donald Trump bringing Paula and two other Clinton sexual assault accusers , Juanita Broaddrick and Paula Jones , to the second presidential debate earlier this month . Fox News reported on the televised conversation : " The View " host Sunny Hostin suggested that Clinton may have missed an opportunity to address the controversy during the second presidential debate . " This is the thing though   …      if a woman sleeps with your husband , you ’re not going to necessarily embrace them   …      That ’s why when he brought up these allegations , I wonder if she Clinton the opportunity to address it in a way that the public would understand   …     " Hostin mused . Behar disagreed , joking that there was n’t much Hillary Clinton could say to the women . Behar Behar the Democratic nominee could say : " ‘ I would like to apologize to those tramps that have slept with my husband.’ Maybe she Clinton have said that .
