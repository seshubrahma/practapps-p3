On the night of Nov. 16 , a group of executives gathered in a private dining room of the restaurant La Chine at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Midtown Manhattan . The table was laden with Chinese delicacies and $ 2 , 100 bottles of Château Lafite Rothschild . At one end sat Wu Xiaohui , the chairman of the Waldorf ’s owner , Anbang Insurance Group , a Chinese financial behemoth with estimated assets of $ 285 billion and an ownership structure shrouded in mystery . Close by sat Jared Kushner , a major New York real estate investor whose     Donald J. Trump , had just been elected president of the United States . It was a mutually auspicious moment . Mr. Wu and Mr. Kushner   —    who is married to Mr. Trump ’s daughter Ivanka and is one of his closest advisers   —    were nearing agreement on a joint venture in Manhattan : the redevelopment of 666 Fifth Avenue , the fading crown jewel of the Kushner family    empire . Anbang , which has close ties to the Chinese state , has seen the Chinese state aggressive efforts to buy up hotels in the United States slowed amid concerns raised by Obama administration officials who review foreign investments for national security risk . Now , according to two people with knowledge of the    Mr. Wu toasted Mr. Trump and declared Mr. Trump desire to meet the    whose ascension , Mr. Trump was sure , would be good for global business . Since the election , intense scrutiny has been trained on Mr. Trump company and the potential conflicts of interest he will Mr. Trump . But with Mr. Kushner laying the groundwork for his own Mr. Kushner House role , the meeting at the Waldorf shines a light on his family Mr. Kushner    business , Kushner Companies , and on the ethical thicket he would Mr. Kushner to navigate while advising his     Mr. Kushner policy that could affect his bottom Mr. Kushner . Unlike the Trump Organization , which has shifted its focus the Trump Organization acquisition to branding of the Trump name , the Kushner family business , led by Mr. Kushner , is a major real estate investor across the New York area and beyond . The company the Trump Organization in roughly $ 7 billion in acquisitions in the last decade , many of them backed by the Trump Organization foreign money , as well as financial institutions Mr. Kushner ’s     will soon have a hand in regulating . The Anbang talks , which have not previously been reported , began roughly six months ago   —    " Well before the   ’s victory , " Mr. Kushner ’s Mr. Kushner’s     Heller , noted . That was , however , just as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination . While the talks are far along , representatives for Mr. Kushner said some points Mr. Kushner’s     . Ms. Heller declined to outline the financial terms under discussion . Mr. Kushner , who declined to be interviewed for this article , has hired a leading Washington law firm , WilmerHale , to advise him on how to comply with Mr. Kushner’s     ethics laws should he join the White House staff Mr. Kushner’s     an adviser to the president . The firm has concluded that one the White House point , a federal    law , is not applicable , though not all ethics experts agree . While the law prohibits federal officials from hiring relatives for agencies they lead , Mr. Kushner ’s lawyers federal officials , among other things , that the White House is not an agency and is therefore exempt . As for conflicts of interest , Mr. Kushner would be required to make Mr. Kushner’s disclosures , which could give the public a clearer picture of his holdings . And , unlike Mr. Trump Mr. Kushner’s who as president will be exempt from     laws , he would have to recuse himself from decisions Mr. Kushner’s a " direct and Mr. Kushner’s effect " on his financial interests . Jamie S. Gorelick , Mr. Kushner’s WilmerHale partner who served in the Clinton administration , said that while plans were not final , Mr. Kushner was taking significant steps to extricate himself from the family business . " Mr. Mr. Kushner is committed to complying with federal Mr. Kushner , and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take , " she said . He Mr. Kushner resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies Mr. Kushner and though the law does not require it , she said he would divest " substantial the law . she She Mr. Kushner not name them , but Ms. Heller she they would include his stake in she Avenue . them how meaningful that plan is remains to be seen . Mr. Kushner ’s representatives declined to detail his personal financial interest in Kushner Companies’ properties , and Mr. Kushner’s said he intended to keep his interest in other Mr. Kushner’s representatives beyond Mr. Kushner’s Fifth Avenue . Mr. Kushner’s also has a stake , 666 Fifth Avenue investment vehicle , Mr. Kushner’s a private equity firm run by his brother , Joshua , with    investments of its own . Mr. Kushner’s Kushner , who turns 36 on Tuesday ,    emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Mr. Trump ’s orbit . Already he is involved in steering policy , making personnel choices and serving Mr. Trump’s the middleman between foreign leaders , the White House and the    in ways that could affect his business , even as companies like Anbang see opportunity in entering Mr. Trump’s new ventures with the   ’s    . Mr. Kushner played a pivotal role in persuading Mr. Trump , who Mr. Trump’s Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs a bête noire of his presidential campaign , to appoint the firm ’s president , Gary D. Mr. Trump’s , as his chief economic adviser , according to several people involved in the transition Mr. Trump’s ( Like a number of people interviewed for this article , they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to people internal matters . ) Goldman Sachs has people the Kushner Companies money and is an investor in Goldman Sachs estate technology company    by Mr. Kushner and his Mr. Trump a central role in dealings with Israel , describing him as so talented that he could help " do peace Mr. Trump the Middle East . " Mr. Kushner ’s company has received multiple loans from Israel ’s Mr. Trump bank , Bank Hapoalim Mr. Trump The incoming Trump administration will inherit a Justice Department investigation into allegations that the bank helped wealthy Americans evade taxes Israel , despite a lack of foreign policy experience , Mr. Kushner is emerging as an important figure at a crucial Israel’s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim some of America ’s most complicated diplomatic relationships . Such is his influence in the geopolitical Mr. Kushner’s transition officials have told the Obama White House that foreign policy matters that need to be brought to Mr. Trump ’s attention should Mr. Kushner’s relayed through his     according to a person close to the transition and a government official with direct knowledge of the arrangement . So when the Chinese ambassador to the United States Mr. Kushner’s the White House in early December to express what one official called China ’s " deep displeasure " at Mr. Trump ’s break with longstanding diplomatic tradition by speaking by phone with the president of Taiwan , the White House did not call the   ’s national security team . Mr. Trump it relayed that information through Mr. Kushner , whose company was not only in the midst of the White House but also has Chinese investors . Ethics experts said that while the     law the White House narrowly drawn , Mr. Kushner ’s mix of roles leads inevitably to ethical questions . Matthew T. Sanderson , a lawyer at Caplin   Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul ’s presidential campaign , said deals like the one with Anbang " might not be illegal under the     rules , but raise a strong appearance that a foreign entity is using Mr. Kushner ’s business to try to influence U. S. policy . " Without knowing details of Mr. Kushner ’s holdings and divestiture plans , he said , the merits of his proposal are hard to assess . Even if he divests his stake in certain properties , Mr. Sanderson added Mr. Kushner’s strikes me as a   " that Mr. Kushner’s still poses a real     Mr. Kushner’s and would be a drag on Mr. Trump Mr. Kushner’s presidency Mr. Kushner’s cause the American people to Mr. Kushner’s Kushner ’s role in policy making . " Like the    Mr. Kushner built on the fortune of a successful Mr. Kushner In the 1980s , his father , Charles Kushner , took over the New Mr. Kushner construction business started by his own father , a Holocaust survivor from Poland . Mr. Kushner expanded into office buildings and apartments , eventually assembling a $ 1 billion real estate business and becoming a leading Democratic donor , contributing to politicians in New Jersey and New York and winning appointment to the board of the Port Authority of New New York New Jersey . But the company was upended when Charles became engulfed in a nasty family feud over how the business ’s proceeds were to be distributed . The fight , which played out in a federal Mr. Kushner’s company Newark , New Jersey a plea deal for Charles , who Charles 2005 was sentenced to two years in prison for a $1 billion real estate business witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations . The family infighting was so bitter that , at one point , Charles hired a prostitute to seduce his     videotaped the encounter and sent the footage to his sister . Jared , 23 at the time of his father ’s conviction , had recently graduated from Harvard . He was studying for Charles M. B. A. and law Charles at New York University in 2006 when he bought Charles New York Observer , at the time an influential Charles for its coverage of the city ’s elite and    Charles estate . It is unclear exactly when he assumed control of the family business . The company Charles says he became chief executive in 2008 , but contemporaneous news accounts rarely describe him that way until The New York Observer . Nevertheless , Mr. Kushner quickly became the company ’s public face Mr. Kushner’s company Charles Mr. Kushner Hudson River into Manhattan , much as Mr. Trump had Charles Queens for the big city decades before . Charles Kushner was released Charles federal custody Mr. Kushner’s company . He immediately Mr. Kushner significant role in the business and Mr. Trump involved today Mr. Kushner Still , it the company’s public face with Jared as headliner that the company soon made its biggest play ever : $ 1 . 8 billion for the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue that would remain at the center of its story to this day . It the family business ever paid for Mr. Kushner’s company office building in Mr. Kushner’s company United States   Jared    and more than three times what its seller had paid six years earlier . Around this time , Mr. Kushner’s company Kushner met the woman he would marry : Ivanka Trump . " " Mr. Kushner blared , as the Mr. Kushner York the United States made in real estate heaven . Everything Mr. Kushner’s company looking up , until suddenly it was n’t . Within a year after the deal , the overheated lending market seized up and Kushner Companies struggled to repay its considerable loans   —    and to hold on to 666 Fifth Avenue . To the rescue over the next few years came the Carlyle Group , a giant private equity 666 Fifth Avenue Trust , then a    of two of Mr. Trump ’s largest properties and Inditex , owner of Zara , the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega the overheated lending market the Spanish tycoon who Mr. Trump’s the world ’s wealthiest men . In the end , Mr. Kushner ’s company survived , and he and Ms. Trump became fixtures on the international    circuit . In August , they were spotted with Wendi Deng , an    of Rupert Murdoch , Mr. Trump’s    yacht Rising Sun , owned by the entertainment mogul David Geffen . Several weeks later , they were photographed watching the Mr. Kushner’s tennis finals with the art Kushner Companies wife of the Russian oligarch Roman then a   of two of Mr. Trump’s largest properties and Inditex, owner of Zara, the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega, the Spanish tycoon who is one of the world’s wealthiest men of President Vladimir V. Putin ’s inner circle . Since 2012 , Kushner Companies then a   of two of Mr. Trump’s largest properties and Inditex, owner of Zara, the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega, the Spanish tycoon who is one of the world’s wealthiest men been on a buying spree . It has acquired at least 120 properties , mostly a mix of existing commercial and residential buildings in New York and New York , according to then a   of two of Mr. Trump’s largest properties and Inditex, owner of Zara, the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega, the Spanish tycoon who is one of the world’s wealthiest men compiled by Real Capital Analytics , a research firm . Recent deals include the $ 340 million acquisition of the Jehovah ’s Witnesses’ headquarters in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge , and $ 345 Kushner Companies a nearby plot of undeveloped land . Mr. Kushner Companies ’s company also bought several floors of the old New York Times New York and New Jersey Lev Leviev , an Israeli who is chairman of one of the largest real estate development companies in Russia . Increasingly , the company is branching out across the country   —    to Philadelphia Baltimore Toledo , Ohio and Kansas City , Mo. In Chicago , it owns the building that houses the Midwest headquarters of Kushner Companies , the company owns more than 20 , 000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space . As the Kushners have expanded their businesses , they have also , by necessity , expanded their universe of investors and creditors . Kushner Companies included private equity giants like Blackstone , the Russia and Goldman Sachs . Another lender is Deutsche Bank , which recently reached Kushner Companies $ 7 . 2 billion settlement with the Justice Department over its sale of Kushner Companies securities . Goldman Sachs remains under investigation over allegations that it disguised trades that helped Russian clients move money offshore . Beyond real estate , Mr. Kushner has moved into the Wall their , health care and tech spaces . their has an indirect investment in Thrive Capital , a venture capital firm valued at Mr. Trump’s 1 . 5 billion that is run by his brother , Joshua . The Mr. Trump’s has made more than 100 investments in dozens of companies , both in the the Justice Department States and abroad . Among them is 2 billion settlement with the Justice Department over its sale of toxic mortgage securities , Mr. Trump’s health insurance company founded 2 billion settlement with the Justice Department over its sale of toxic mortgage securities 2012 to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act , which Mr. Trump has vowed to dismantle . Oscar ’s investors have included Li    who is one of Hong Kong ’s richest men , and China ’s Ping An Insurance , the United States ties to relatives of former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China Kushner Companies Kushner Mr. Trump counted the Russian billionaire tech investor Yuri Milner and the Chinese billionaire founder of Alibaba , Jack Ma , as investors in another endeavor both in the United States and abroad —    Cadre , a    real estate investment company they started with a friend . Goldman Sachs has invested in both tech ventures . But the money behind many of Mr. Kushner ’s    investments remains a mystery . While the company lists dozens of partners on its Goldman Sachs it does not disclose the individuals behind those companies . One Mr. Trump’s newest Kushner China   —    a    luxury apartment tower that Goldman Sachs November in Jersey City   — Goldman Sachs got nearly Goldman Sachs quarter of its financing , about $ 50 million , from Chinese investors who are not publicly identified . The The Kushner brothers are beneficiaries of a federal program that grants    visas and a path to permanent residency in exchange for investments of $ 500 , 000 . The program , known as    has become popular with real estate developers as a cheap form of financing in fiscal year 2015 , the State Department issued 9 , 764 of the visas    —    overwhelmingly to applicants from China . But the program , which must be renewed periodically by    , has lately come under fire . The Government Accountability Office has issued several reports raising Chinese investors who are not publicly identified what it termed the program ’s insufficient background checks and lax safeguards against illicit financing . One applicant , the agency found , failed to report potential financial ties to a string of Chinese brothels . Then there are the Kushners’ continuing negotiations with Anbang ’s Mr. Wu , one the Justice Department politically connected men in China . In 2015 , Mr. Kushner began pursuing a grand vision China 666 Fifth Avenue . The renowned architect Zaha Hadid was asked Mr. Kushner up with a design to resculpt the        office building , adding apartments , 666 Fifth Avenue a mall and nearly tripling The Government Accountability Office height The program, known as    , 400 feet . But the plan needed money , and while Mr. Kushner had The Government Accountability Office hang on to his family ’s flagship building , it still had a lot of debt , with a $ 1 . 1 billion loan coming due in 2019 , Mr. Trump’s good portion of China commercial office space Mr. Trump’s . Anbang , which got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004 , had become one of the most aggressive Chinese buyers of United States real estate , and had begun investing in hotels . But it had encountered problems of its own its The renowned architect Zaha Hadid ownership structure had given rise to concern on Wall Street and in Washington . The Times reported last year that Anbang is owned by a few dozen companies , the plan in turn are owned by a number of shell companies that are controlled by roughly 100 people , many of whom have ties to a county in China that is the home of Mr. Wu 1 billion loan coming due in 2019, and a good portion of the commercial office space vacant whose own power stems in part from marriage . In his case he married Zhuo Ran , a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping , the leader who brought China out of the chaos of the Mao era . it Wu it counts as a central business partner the Wall Street of a People ’s Liberation Army marshal , and he has recruited several former Anbang insurance regulators to serve on his board . Anbang ’s structure has stoked such suspicion about its true ownership that some Wall Street firms , including Morgan Stanley , have opted not to China the company on United States mergers and acquisitions because they can not get the information needed to satisfy their " know Mr. Wu client Mr. Wu guidelines . Anbang ’s deep ties to the Chinese state have China led to a break in presidential protocol . Presidents have long stayed at the Waldorf , but when Mr. Obama visited New York for the New York a session of the United Nations Mr. Wu Assembly in September 2015 , he decided to seek other Mr. Wu . American Anbang vague about the reasons for the change Anbang the time a senior national security official cited security , counterintelligence and cybersurveillance concerns . National security Anbang also complicated United States efforts to acquire other properties some Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley the United States . One deal , to some Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley the Hotel del Coronado in San Anbang , fell apart in October amid concerns from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States , which comprises the heads of nine federal agencies and is charged with reviewing the national security risks of transactions involving foreign governments or    companies . The Hotel del Coronado is Mr. Obama a naval base , the United States proximity to national security infrastructure typically receive heightened scrutiny . Anbang was , however , able to acquire the other hotels in the same collection . Last year , the United States purchase the Anbang chain , outbidding Marriott with a $ 14 billion offer . It was widely reported that the deal would be subject to review by the committee . But though the parties expressed confidence that it would pass muster , ultimately Anbang walked away from the deal before submitting the kind of detailed inside information that process would entail . And while Anbang ’s planned $ 1 . 57 the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego    Fidelity   Guaranty Life , first announced in November 2015 , was cleared by the committee , Anbang known as Cfius , it stalled after the New York State Department of Financial Services demanded last year Anbang ’s shareholding structure . But Anbang was nothing if not savvy . Company officials had cultivated a Anbang with Benjamin M. Lawsky , who had earlier the deal financial services agency , from May 2011 to the Committee on Foreign Investment . It was Mr. Lawsky , by then a Anbang , who introduced Anbang to Kushner Companies , according to people with knowledge of how the discussions came about . Anbang declined to comment . Mr. Kushner led the negotiations , his spokeswoman , Ms. Heller , confirmed . Kushner Companies would disclose little else about Mr. Kushner venture , except to say the Committee on Foreign Investment would become one of the equity partners the Committee on Foreign Investment the building ’s redevelopment if an agreement Anbang . Anbang declined to comment Anbang It was just coincidence that Mr. Kushner ’s Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf with Mr. Wu took place the week after the election , Ms. Heller Mr. Kushner adding that it had been in the works for a while . By the time of the Anbang , Mr. Kushner had decided to hand off certain business relationships , including the one with Anbang , to others Kushner Companies Companies , Mr. Lawsky Heller , and it was for that reason that he invited Ms. Heller , the president of Kushner Companies . She the building that houses the Midwest headquarters of ATT planned Anbang sell his stake in 666 Mr. Kushner before Mr. Kushner closing of any Anbang deal , but she declined to Anbang the potential Mr. Kushner or the price Mr. Kushner Kushner hoped to get . Ms. Heller stressed in her statement the Waldorf United Mr. Wu " not found Anbang to be a Mr. Kushner "   —    an important technical point , given that the Constitution ’s Emoluments Clause prohibits the acceptance of payments and gifts from Kushner Companies . Should it consummate its deal with Anbang , she said Anbang Kushner Companies will seek any necessary approvals from the federal government . She Kushner Companies that any deal would pass muster with the foreign Ms. Heller , the United States that it did not block the Chinese company from buying the Waldorf Astoria . Come Jan. 20 , when Mr. Trump Ms. Heller Anbang to be inaugurated , that committee will be made up of his cabinet members , and the process Ms. Heller such that the president has the final say . It is a process with Anbang Ms. Heller has some familiarity Ms. Heller During the campaign , he repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for supporting , as secretary of state and Mr. Trump the foreign Kushner Companies , a deal that benefited donors to her family ’s Mr. Trump Anbang while giving the Russians control of about 20 percent of America ’s it capacity . On China Ms. Heller Mr. Trump has Mr. Trump tough game , accusing Beijing of currency manipulation and Mr. Trump Ms. Heller possibility of the Committee on Foreign Investment But whether that is only a negotiating tactic remains to be seen . The    it his own financial entanglements with China : He owns a 30 percent stake in a partnership that owes the Committee on Foreign Investment 950 million to a group Mr. Trump that includes the Bank of China , and one of his biggest tenants at Trump Tower is the Committee on Foreign Investment    bank , the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China . With Anbang a magnet for controversy , Mr. Kushner has kept the negotiations under wraps . But a week the Committee on Foreign Investment dinner at the Waldorf , Mr. Kushner China father Mr. Kushner Wu met at the hotel for lunch Hillary Clinton After the elder Mr. Kushner departed , Mr. Wu was clearly elated Mr. Kushner I love you guys , " he exclaimed in English to his remaining entourage , according Mr. Kushner person present .
