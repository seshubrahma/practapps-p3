Joe Scarborough said that although Joe Scarborough thought President Donald Trump’s executive order was bad policy , the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling was " laughable " and Joe Scarborough said it will be overturned . the appeals court’s ruling Our law professors always told us   —    bad facts made bad law , " Joe Scarborough said . " Horrific facts coupled with horrific politics makes for horrific law . That ’s exactly what happened here . " " This decision , though , is laughable , " Scarborough conitnued . " This is , for Joe Scarborough , the most disturbing part of the entire case . And by the way , at the end , this is n’t going to matter because I think the White House is going to fix it up , briefly fix this up . They could this a couple the White House changes and take care of these problems . But the Ninth said , ‘ The government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order have perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.’ As if it is the executive branches job to actually get the Intel community in and say these are all the things that are going to happen . No , in fact , Barack Obama worked with a bipartisan Congress to come up with these seven countries , not these specific attacks , but because they saw deteriorating security situation that they these to remedy . They wanted these prevent attacks . That these the entire purpose of that . " " This will be overturned , " he added .
