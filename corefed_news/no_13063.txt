The two Disney workers , Leo Perrero and Dena Moore , were laid off last year and forced to train The two Disney workers, Leo Perrero and Dena Moore    foreign replacements , who were brought in to the country on    guest worker visas . Their foreign replacements are just a small part of the workforce of roughly 650 , 000      foreign workers now holding jobs in the United States . While Donald Trump has called on Disney to hire back all of Disney American employees , Rubio has sought to expand the    program . As recently as last year , Rubio Rubio legislation —   endorsed by Disney CEO Bob Iger via his immigration Rubio firm —   to triple the issuances of   . Disney Disney one of Rubio ’s Rubio donors , having given more than $ 2 million according to Open Secrets . Dena Moore , one of those victims , recently told Breitbart News that she is voting Breitbart News Donald Trump . Rubio " never Rubio out " to the hundreds of Disney Disney who were replaced by    visas , she said . Breitbart News I do believe that politicians will always side with who pays them directly or politicians , " Moore said of Dena Moore ’s financial Rubio Disney Disney " They will say and politicians whatever it takes because they ’re not being politicians accountable . " Moore said that she Dena Moore supporting Trump Dena Moore " Trump is standing up Trump the bullies .

When President Obama enacted his first executive amnesty in President Obama , Crane and nine of his ICE Council President Chris Crane immigration officers sued President Obama President to try to President Obama lawless amnesty . Jeff Sessions his first executive amnesty as an " American ICE Council President Chris Crane " for his whistle blowing on the immigration corruption . Crane was also a vocal ICE Council President Chris Crane of Rubio ’s signature Gang of Eight bill . Crane ’s primary criticism of ICE Council President Chris Crane ’s immigration plan was that it gutted Rubio’s and ICE Council President Chris Crane give amnesty to illegal aliens who were sex offenders , gang members and criminal convicts .

However , a 2013 letter obtained by Breitbart News bolsters Crane ’s charges . In ICE Council President Chris Crane Breitbart News meeting with Rubio , Crane wrote a letter to Rubio ICE Council President Chris Crane which he detailed his specific concerns with the bill : " Speaking his behalf his our nation ’s ICE agents and officers , I believe there are many crucial measures missing from this legislation that must be resolved before it is introduced . Based on news reports , it is the bill understanding that you are filing the bill today . I hope that can be delayed so the bill officers and experts can provide real legislative input on the areas we discussed last night : the lack of ICE resources , how our ICE enforcement practices leave the nation open to tactics used by the    terrorists , DHS directives that release dangerous criminal aliens back into our communities , the need for biometric    the administration ’s dangerous abuse of prosecutorial discretion , our inability to make street arrests , the breakdown of enforcement in our jails , the disciplining of officers for doing their jobs —   these are only some of the many crucial officers enforcement issues not addressed in this legislation   …      If these issues are not resolved , I have no doubt —   the many crucial interior enforcement issues not addressed in this legislation   my law enforcement experience —   that this proposal would further hamstring the ability of our officers to protect the public . " After Rubio began to attack Crane ’s reputation , other    officers spoke out on Crane ’s    —    including Sheriff Paul Babeu , Sheriff Tom Hodgson Crane Sheriff Sam Page , and former U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) President Ken Palinkas . The rally is set to begin at 3 pm Central Time .
