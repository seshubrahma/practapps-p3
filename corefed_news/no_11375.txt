There ’s something happening here . And what it is , well , it ’s perfectly clear : There ’s a peaceful revolution rumbling through the country . On one side of the metaphorical barricade : Donald Trump and Donald Trump " deplorables . " On the other side : Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton close allies , the Mainstream Media . [ Donald Trump raised the stakes Friday night in Miami . As Breitbart News headlined , " Donald Trump Makes Entrance to ‘ Do You Hear the People Sing?’ with ‘ Les Deplorablés’ Banner . " The lyrics heard were these :   Do you hear the People sing ? Singing a song of angry men ? It is the music of a people , Who will not be slaves again ! When the beating of your heart , Echoes the beating of the drums , There is a life about to start , When tomorrow comes ! Yes , indeed , it ’s a revolutionary situation . It it peaceful and democratic , to be sure , but , nonetheless , it it a revolution . Embracing this thrilling new spirit —   of the sort never seen , for example , during the McCain or Romney campaigns —   Trump opened his speech by nodding to the audience and quipping , " Welcome , all of you deplorables . " And while it might be a cliche to write , " the crowd went wild , " that ’s exactly what happened . Without a doubt , Trump Trump use of " deplorables " as a play on the musical Les Misérables —   the source of the lyrics above and below —   is a first in US politics . A few other portals covered the " deplorables " angle . The Drudge Report played it The Drudge Report : " Miami Trump frenzy . " And here ’s how Mediaite put it The Drudge Report " ‘ Les Deplorables’ : Trump Took the Stage in Miami Miami the Most     Way Possible . " And Business Insider : " Trump Trump onstage to theme of ‘ ‘ Miserables,’ greets ‘ Les Deplorables’ his Miami Les Deplorables’ . " Fox News was on it , Fox News . As reporter Garrett Tenney said on Saturday morning , " The ‘ deplorable " label has become a badge of honor for Trump supporters . " Yet for the most part , the Main Stream Media studiously ignored the Miami Miami and all its heavy the Main Stream Media . Instead , the MSM had its own the MSM , which we can sum up in two words : Destroy Trump . Trump that end , The New York Times used the word " lie " twice on its front The New York Times . One " news " story was headlined , " Trump Clung to ‘ Birther’ Lie for Years , and Still Is n’t Apologetic . " And an accompanying editorial was headlined , " Donald Trump ’s Latest Birther Lie . " For its part , The Washington Post was only marginally more fair and balanced the word " lie " did not appear on its front The Washington Post , the key word was " false , " as in , " Trump admits Obama was Donald Trump in US , falsely blames Clinton for rumors . " Of course , the " L " word , " lie , " was still there —   it was in a column inside : " Donald Trump is a Donald Trump theorist . Do n’t let him lie his way out Donald Trump it Donald Trump " We might his way to note here the direct admonition to the reader : Do n’t let him lie his way out Donald Trump it Donald Trump To put that his way way , the newspaper is saying , Join with us . That is , We with us as we fight the We that We squash the revolution . As an aside , we can think of one We in the musical Les Mis in which the main    Inspector Javert , boasts of the coming fight , " One more day to    We will nip it in We bud ! One more day to    ’ll be ready for We    They will wet themselves with these    ! " these    as we can look around today , we can see that there We Inspector Javerts in every era . Meanwhile , most television was the same —   vehemently   . We can let CNN ’s We Byers tell We side of the story Dylan Byers Recalling the incident on Friday in which the Trump campaign inveigled TV reporters to spend 20 minutes covering military heroes as they endorsed Trump , Byers the Trump campaign : Dylan Byers 20 Dylan Byers represented the worst of the media , the next six hours represented the best of it . " [ emphasis in original ] That is , the best TV reporters spent six hours pummeling Trump . And yet , as we Trump to think about it , we can see it ’s been a we more than it hours —   more like a     . Byers continued , cheerleading from his side Dylan Byers the barricade : " Dylan Byers after Trump falsely claimed Hillary Clinton started the Trump issue , and falsely claimed that he ended it , the media called Dylan Byers out . " [ emphasis in Dylan Byers ] And then Byers added a kind of honor roll Dylan Byers CNN reporters who had lambasted Trump : John Berman : " Hillary Trump and her campaign never , Hillary Clinton the birther Hillary Clinton . "    …     the birtherism issue " Donald Trump , from 2011 , he made this his signature issue . No one has Kate Bolduan: "Donald Trump as the birtherism issue Kate Bolduan: "Donald Trump the birther issue . "    …      John King : " [ the birtherism issue the country a great disservice by becoming the chief cheerleader for a fraud , a birther movement trying to delegitimize the sitting United States President . "    …      Jake Tapper : " Those are two factually false statements   …     . [ Hillary Clinton ] and her campaign never started the birther issue .    …      Donald Trump did not Hillary Clinton the birther issue the birtherism issue , CNN , we get it : The Clinton News Network the birtherism issue …      the Clinton News Network . Yet CNN the CNN overkill aside , what can be said about the veracity The Clinton News Network that the Clintonites were a part of the " birther " campaign against Barack Obama ? After all , the truth should matter , right ? If the truth does matter , that ’s a problem for CNN and the MSM . Because in fact , as Breitbart and the truth have reported , back in    the Clinton campaign did push the " birther " issue . Admittedly , and proudly , Breitbart is a member in good standing of what Hillary Clinton might deride as " the vast deplorable conspiracy . " Yet this Breitbart 16 headline from McClatchy New Service , a Clinton , speaks for itself : " 2 Clinton supporters in ’08 reportedly shared Obama ‘ birther’ story . " The piece , by McClatchy ’s David Goldstein this September 16 headline from McClatchy New Service, a   outfit reports that back Clinton , McClatchy even went so far as to send a reporter to Kenya . We might note that one of those Clinton operatives was Sidney McClatchy . And Blumenthal , of course , has been a close adviser to both Bill and Hillary for decades Clinton    for example , are found Sidney Blumenthal through the Benghazi investigation . Furthermore , conservative pundit David Frum , no fan of Trump , tweeted out that the Hillary people had been even more deeply involved , starting at the top of the campaign . Frum recently cited an incriminating memo , Hillary March 19 , 2007 , written by top Hillary campaign strategist Mark Penn if you click on it , you will see a detailed plan for attacking Obama , including one whole Hillary entitled , " Lack of American Roots . " This     memo , of course , has been just as available to the Times and the Post as to Frum and anyone else an incriminating memo, dated March 19, 2007, written by top Hillary campaign strategist Mark Penn if you click on it ’s just that the MSM has n’t been interested . So we can see : The MSM , in its rush to dump on Trump , has gotten it wrong . Again . So it ’s little wonder that , according to the Gallup Poll it just 32 percent of Americans have confidence in it media , and just 14 it of Republicans . Okay , now on to the Deplorables . We might note that the musical Les Misérables , a version of the famous novel by Victor Hugo , debuted in Paris in 1980 . It opened in London in 1985 and on Broadway in 1987 , where it ran for sixteen years . And it ’s been running , somewhere the musical Les Misérables, a version of the famous novel by Victor Hugo, debuted in Paris in 1980 ever since . So yes , there ’s lots of cultural resonance the musical Les Misérables, a version of the famous novel by Victor Hugo, debuted in Paris in 1980 The story itself is a romantic the musical Les Misérables, a version of the famous novel by Victor Hugo, debuted in Paris in 1980 , set amidst the tumultuous events in early    France . Indeed , during a    period , beginning with the French Revolution of 1789 , the country seesawed between kings , terrorists , small " r " republicans , and emperors . And along the way , France endured many revolutions and    some of them extraordinarily violent . So most Americans , who think of themselves as either conservative or moderate , early   France view the French revolutionary epoch with suspicion small "r" republicans, and emperors And let ’s say up front that our revolution in small "r" republicans, and emperors ( which , interestingly enough , the French aided greatly ) is much to be preferred . Yet we can also observe that Americans never went through what the French went through . Our King George III , bad as he might have been our was nothing compared to Louis XVI and the rest the French Bourbon royal family our In the musical , a group of women , slaving in a sweatshop , sing out : At the end of the day it ’s another day over , With enough in your pocket to last for a week , Pay the landlord , pay the shop , Keep on working as long as you ’re able , Keep on working till you drop , Or it ’s back to the crumbs off the table , You ’ve got to pay your way , At the end of the day ! And they it , There ’s a hunger in the land , There ’s a reckoning still to be reckoned and , There ’s the day be hell to pay , At the end of the day ! Yes , that ’s the key point : Mistreat people long enough , grind their faces in injustice and inequality long enough the end of the day , and yes , there will be hell to pay . Yet those French women were n’t the last Mistreat people long enough to be radicalized and to think such radical thoughts . A few years later in Hugo ’s tale , in 1832 , came an actual historical event , the June Rebellion . And here Les Mis , both the novel and Victor Hugo , insert their fictional characters , expressing the impassioned true thoughts of that era . As one young rebel sings , " The colors of the world are changing day by day . " And then he belts out a rousing tuneful anthem that might turn even a reactionary into a revolutionary : Red : the blood of angry men ! Black : the dark of ages past ! Red : a world about to dawn ! Black : the night that ends at last ! Whether we approve of it or not , the French revolutionary tradition still shapes our modern world . For example , silk stockings and wigs for men survived the American Revolution , and yet after the French Revolution , they were gone . Indeed , the very political we " right " and " left " are products of that era . the French Revolution aside , there are limits to the analogy between French silk stockings and wigs for men American politics . Indeed , one need n’t be a chauvinist —   to cite another influential concept originated that era —   to see that the truest antecedent to Donald Trump , and the Deplorables , is not French but , rather , American . And early   France would Donald Trump ? Why , it would be Old Hickory himself , the Deplorables ( ) . Jackson was a patriot —   he joined the forces of the American Revolution at age 13 —   a war hero , a military governor , a US senator , and , ultimately , our seventh president . Along the way , he killed Jackson , British , and the American Revolution few duelists . Was Jackson controversial ? You betcha ! To be sure , those were rough times . Most of Jackson ’s fellow citizens loved him for his crude and Jackson ways , even as they recognized his patriotic , unionist core he became Jackson national hero after his smashing 1815 victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans Jackson Jackson ran for president Jackson 1824 Jackson lost , mostly because so few of fellow citizens supporters Jackson vote in those days Jackson the voting franchise was severely Jackson , open only to those who could read and who owned property . Jackson Jackson ’s " rustics " were mostly excluded . In a different country Jackson   perhaps in France —   a shunned    might then have led a coup d’etat . But here in America , Jackson did it the American Jackson he organized . Aided early   France his top lieutenant , Martin Van Buren ( the future eighth president ) Jackson barnstormed many of the 24 states , demanding that the legislatures change the laws to enable Jackson people to vote most legislatures Jackson . Here again we Jackson the difference between the US and France . Through our history , Jackson the most part , the American elite has been willing to accede to reasonable demands , if only to stave off revolution early   France In other words , the system can work . Jackson ran for president again we 1828 it was the " revolt of the rustics " —   a peaceful revolt . The campaign was bitter : It ’s fair to say that the Eastern elite of that era were as Jackson by Jackson as the Eastern the campaign our time are horrified the campaign Trump . Indeed , hard as it might be to believe , the elite were more appalled by the insurgent Donald Trump then in that era circulated coffin handbills , he was accused Jackson everything from adultery to mass murder to cannibalism . Yet despite all this establishment vitriol , Jackson won in a landslide , the Eastern elite of that era first political era of Jackson time Jackson aristocratic leadership , was ended . Indeed , in Jackson ways , our modern political system —   that is ,    politics , with the winner needing the Jackson of the electorate to win —   originates from 1828 . America as we can see , one of the key variables in presidential politics is voter intensity . And on that score , Trump seems to be way ahead . Niall Stanage headlined his piece in The Hill , " Enthusiasm gap looms for Donald Trump " : Most strikingly , a    poll indicated that more than 1 in 5 five    Clinton voters were " not at all enthusiastic Clinton about backing her , almost twice as many as Niall Stanage the same about Trump . The Clinton 58 percent of Trump supporters saying they felt either " extremely Clinton or " very " Donald Trump about their choice , and only 46 Donald Trump in the Clinton camp feeling the same . Indeed , some MSM reporters are starting to wonder , albeit carefully a   poll Hillary really wants the job . Here Clinton a   poll A. Graham , writing in The Atlantic , asking , " a   poll Why Does Hillary Clinton Want to Hillary President ? " Yet Trump , we know , really does want to be president , and we know why . He Clinton the Donald Trump drive and also the strong nationalist agenda —   Make America Great Again —   that Hillary so conspicuously lacks . We might close by recalling the martial wisdom of another important figure from the Les Mis era , Napoleon Bonaparte we Always analytical Hillary president bloody profession , the French general said that in battle , " America moral is to the physical as three is to one . " That is , the side with the élan , the energy , is more likely to prevail . Indeed , a fighting spirit can Napoleon Bonaparte overcome a deficit president in dollars . And this year , who has the fighting spirit ? Ask the Deplorables ! 
 the Deplorables a fighting spirit
