British people who want to take back their country ’s sovereignty from unelected bureaucrats in the European Union ( EU ) are " far right " " populist " and " nationalist " according to the Washington Post . [ An article by Matt O’Brien   —    illustrated with a photograph of former London Mayor Boris Johnson standing in front of a ‘ Vote Leave’ truck   —    talks about how "   populists are trying to make populists country great again by , you guessed it , keeping immigrants out and negotiating great , and I mean great , deals . "   Using the terms "   populists " " nationalists " and " " interchangeably , O’Brien also takes aim at UKIP , using    Treasury figures to suggest Brexit would cost up to 800 , 000 jobs . Maintaining that Britain is going through a depression , Britain points out that the Great Depression of the 1930s saw the rise of " right wing extremism "   —    the implication being that those who want to leave the EU are the heirs of that extremism . Britain does graciously admit , however , that " Today ’s    populists , depending on your opinion of Donald Trump , are n’t fascists so much as nationalists . So nationalists might exploit racial tensions and nationalists might be illiberal , but nationalists probably do n’t want to start World War III . " The bad news , though , is that " it ’s going to take a lot more than economic growth to make nationalists go away , " Britain adds before describing US politician Pat Buchanan as " " . The term ‘ ’ traditionally only applied to    and racial purists , is now being used increasingly to describe any group that opposes mass immigration and is vaguely patriotic . Parties such as Alternative for Germany and the Freedom Party of Austria , which pledge allegiance to liberal values but oppose large scale immigration , are routinely labelled ‘ ’ by Europe ’s mainstream media , grouping Parties such as Alternative for Germany and the Freedom Party of Austria, which pledge allegiance to liberal values but oppose large scale immigration alongside   . Needless to say the Washington Post article was heavily criticised in the comments section . Chinwag Gazooks wrote : " This is the very worst article I have ever read in the Post . This is just full of misinformation , " before explaining : " ( a ) UKIP is not far right   —    I do n’t support the party but the party is not a racist party ( b ) most of the top presenters are actually both moderate Conservativve [ sic ] and moderate Labour ( c ) there are some great arguments to remain and some great arguments to leave . " Another commenter adds : " My decision on the 23rd June is not a left or right vote . the 23rd June an in or out vote . The right or left wing are irrelevant in this vote . " Meanwhile , Millenial Lawyer simply asked : " Is this article based in fact , or is it made up biased nonsense ? "
