Wednesday on MSNBC , actor and director Rob Reiner said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was " the single most unqualified person ever to run for president in my lifetime . "   Rob Reiner said   " Well , yes . We talk about somebody coming from a reality show . Running for president is not a reality show . It ’s actual reality . And this man is the single most unqualified person ever to run for president in my lifetime . I mean , just to hear what you just said , we We an entire presidency taken down in the ’70s over Watergate , and that was a    to the national Democratic headquarters that did n’t amount to anything because they did n’t get anything . Here we We a    to the Democratic national headquarters where everything is stolen , and there ’s a conceivable connection to the Trump campaign . That to me is just     insane . I ca n’t even believe we ’re having this conversation here . I mean , this is     crazy . We we in crazy land here . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
