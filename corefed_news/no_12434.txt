The Clinton family charities have outsourced many U. S.    jobs to foreign college graduates instead of hiring American college graduates . [ The outsourcing started in 2004 and The outsourcing continues to this year . When asked if the foundation is still hiring foreign    workers via the controversial    visa program , Vena Cooper , one of the foundation ’s personnel officers , responded " the foundation is still hiring foreign   workers via the controversial   visa program, Vena Cooper, one of the foundation’s personnel officers do . "   The foundations declined to answer questions from Breitbart News , but available data shows they sought to hire up to 130 foreign graduates .   That ’s roughly half the number of 250 jobs outsourced by Disney last October , which has reignited political criticism of the    outsourcing program . The 130 foreign graduates sought by the Clinton ’s foundations were and are not immigrants . Instead , The 130 foreign graduates sought by the Clinton’s foundations ’re temporary " guest " workers who fill outsourced professional jobs for up to six years . The 130 requests were made over several years , and do not include requests from other other unrelated employers that also carry the Clinton name . The Clintons’ foreign graduates have been hired via the    visa program that also is used by Disney and U. S. corporations and universities to employ a population of roughly 650 , 000 young and cheap foreign professionals in business , design , healthcare , software , science , education , p. r. and media and pharmaceutical jobs . After their six years in the United States , most    return home with the    and connections that help their compete against U. S. professionals in the global marketplace .   The young foreign    professionals are also used to push down average salaries earned by experienced and older American professionals . In turn , those salary cuts boost profit margins and company values on Wall Street .   The Clinton foundation ’s foreign workers include some    experts . But most are    workers   —    comptrollers and budget analysts ,    managers and directors , or foreign policy analysts . Most work of these workers are sent to jobs in New York , Boston and Washington D. C. Here ’s a description of some of the outsourced jobs , as detailed at VisaSquare . com .   Polls show this    outsourcing is extremely unpopular . For example , a 2014 poll showed that   " nearly 9 out of 10 [ respondents ] believe that U. S.   workers and legal immigrants already here should get first preference for jobs . " The family foundation ’s board is headed by her husband , Bill Clinton , and also includes Hillary Clinton ’s daughter , plus her    aide , Cheryl Mills . Hillary Clinton’s helped run The family foundation’s prior to her appointment Hillary Clinton’s run the Department of State in 2009 .   She formally Hillary Clinton’s the foundation ’s board in 2013 , but quit again in April 2015 to run for president .   The discovery of Clinton ’s Hillary Clinton’s hires is a boon for her Democratic Hillary Clinton’s Bernie Sanders , and for GOP frontrunner Donald Trump . Trump is GOP frontrunner Donald Trump opposition to the    program a leading element in his campaign GOP frontrunner Donald Trump despite his practice GOP frontrunner Donald Trump hiring at least 1 , 000    guest workers via the similar    visa program . So far , Trump ’s GOP frontrunner Donald Trump criticism of the    the   program explain his     GOP frontrunner Donald Trump among    and people with    degrees . Sanders is also an opponent of the    program . the   program for example , Sanders denounced the new    programs Sanders inside the unpopular " comprehensive immigration reform " bill that was defeated in 2014 .   " It does not make a lot of sense to me that we have an immigration Sanders bill which includes a massive increase in temporary guest worker programs that will allow large multinational corporations to import hundreds of thousands of temporary    and    guest workers into this country from overseas , " Sanders said during the 2013 debate . That stance is very popular among his supporters , including many     Sanders   " I came out of school [ in 2011 ] with a huge amount of debt   …      I had three    jobs   …     . and I have a ton of student debt , " Nicholas Shoukas , a Sanders’ activist , told Breitbart News . He ’s now working with developmentally Sanders kids in Fredericksburg , Va. for $ 45 , 000 a year . He ’s married , but doubts Sanders he ’ll be able to afford Sanders house needed to raise a family .   Sanders repeated his    argument in two February Sanders Democratic debates , even as he also called for legalization of Sanders 11 million foreign migrants living in the United States .   " The    programs that were embedded in [ the 2007 immigration bill that also failed ] agreement were akin to slavery , " Sanders said Feb. 11 . " Sanders to slavery , where people came into this country to do guest work the United States , were exploited , and if they stood up for their rights , people ’d be thrown people of this people . " Sanders’ criticism was the United States the    and    programs that provide      for the owners of resorts and hotels , restaurants , vineyards , landscaping , slaughterhouses and orchards . Those owners include Trump , who has hired the owners of resorts and hotels, restaurants, vineyards, landscaping, slaughterhouses and orchards      for his resorts , including his     Club in Palm Sanders , Fla. Sanders Sanders also hitting Clinton over her support of the    program . In early Clinton , Sanders’ team circulated this 2012 video of Clinton touting the outsourcing program   —    and Clinton suggesting the   program offset a supposed lack of skilled American graduates this 2012 video of Clinton touting the outsourcing program   —    to an audience of young graduates in India , which provides most    workers to U. S. companies . The relevant section starts at 51:30 . " It has been going on for many years now , and it The relevant section part of our economic relationship with India . Uh , The relevant section I think there are advantages with it India have certainly benefited many parts of our country , and The relevant section are disadvantages that go the need to improve the job skills of our own people and create a better economic environment , " she told the Indian audience . Clinton has run into similar criticism Clinton , including in 2004 , and in her 2007 race against Barack Obama , in 2009 , and in Clinton 2011 appointment to a State Department panel .   The Clinton ’s foundation is also supported by many companies that use Clinton Clinton Google and Microsoft . For example , Tata Consultancy Services is an Indian company that uses    from India to win large contracts from large companies in the United States , typically for    software support and maintenance .   But Sanders’ campaign against the    program    so far , has been crippled by his need to win Latino votes in the Democatic primaries . For example , Sanders’ released a video championing his support for unskilled ,      Latino farm workers Sanders’ Few voters   — Sanders’ and even fewer reporters   —    can easily reconcile Sanders’ support for        illegals with his simultaneous opposition to        outsourcing workers . Each year , roughly 700 , Sanders’    are imported for a variety of    jobs . That total includes roughly almost 200 , 000      and     . In late 2015 , GOP and Democratic leaders in Congress sharply quadrupled the inflow of      adding up to 200 , 000 more    to the annual inflow this year . The overall inflow of    includes roughly 110 , 000 new    workers each year . Each worker can stay for six years or longer , so the annual inflow creates a resident population of 650 , 000    in the the annual inflow Many are employed in      jobs . But many    are employed in    jobs , such as those outsourced by the Clinton charities . For example , the    ’s universities and business partners employ roughly 100 , 000    including roughly 21 , 754 professors , lecturers and instructors , 20 , 566 doctors , clinicians and therapists , 25 , 175 researchers ,    and biologists , plus 30 , 000 financial planners , p. r. experts , writers , editors , sports coaches , designers , accountants , economists , statisticians , lawyers , architects , computer experts and much else . The annual inflow of      plus the arrival of 1 million legal immigrants and a few hundred thousand illegal immigrants , provides employers with roughly one new foreign worker for every two of the 4 million Americans who turn 18 each year . The huge scale of the    program has been successfully hidden by business groups and by the   program outlets , many of which suggest the program only includes 65 , 000 workers . For example , Emma B. the   program biological scientist who canvassed for Bernie Sanders in February , told Breitbart News that Sanders never Breitbart News the    Breitbart News . That ’s remarkable because she ’s now working on a stipend Breitbart News the the   program Health , which has hired hundreds of foreign biological scientists via the    program , instead of Americans like her , over the last few years Breitbart News GOP voters , the   program already pushed two     presidential candidates   —    Jeb Bush and Sen. Lindsey Graham   — GOP out of the race . A third advocate for more    visas , Sen. Marco Rubio , is slipping out of the race . Graham her 2007 race against Barack Obama example , lobbied agencies to deliver      workers for a golf resort in his home state of South her 2007 race against Barack Obama He helped start the Sen. Lindsey Graham   " comprehensive immigration reform " bill that would have created an amnesty and increased the Sen. Lindsey Graham   of    to farms and slaughterhouses Sen. Lindsey Graham   his state , and    professionals to every state . Bush built his 2016 economic platform on a promise that companies should be allowed to outsource many Sen. Lindsey Graham   jobs to imported   .   Rubio also has   Jeb Bush his   Jeb Bush crippled by broad opposition his campaign 2013 immigration bill . That bill would have allowed companies   —    such as    based in his home Rubio   —    to hire many Rubio foreign    workers , his 2013 immigration bill also allowed an unlimited hiring of foreigners who get college degrees at Rubio S. universities . The bill would also have amnestied all illegal immigrants , and would his 2013 immigration bill doubled legal immigration to 2 U. S. per year . All told , Rubio ’s bill would his 2013 immigration bill the arrival of one foreign worker each year for every one of the roughly 4 million Americans who turn 18 each year . Rubio contrast his 2013 immigration bill platform offered by Trump promises GOP frontrunner Donald Trump build a wall against illegal immigrants , and repatriate illegals now living in the United States . It also promises to raise wages the United States workers . If enacted , the      would largely end the financial incentive for U. S companies to hire foreign workers instead of American graduates .   the immigration platform offered by Trump March 3 , for example , Trump reiterated GOP frontrunner Donald Trump     GOP frontrunner Donald Trump , saying in a statement that : " The    program is neither    nor immigration : these are temporary foreign workers , imported from abroad , for the explicit purpose of the   program workers at lower pay . I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant , widespread    abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements . I will end forever the use of the    as a cheap labor program , and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program . No exceptions . " Sen. Ted Cruz also call for some restrictions on    after advocating for increasing    in 2013 .   Any president can sharply curb the use of    workers by rewriting the    regulations , without any need for approval from    leaders in Congress .   Trump ’s GOP frontrunner Donald Trump reforms are extremely unpopular among business leaders because the    program reduces their labor costs and increases their profits . " The entire Silicon Valley Congress that the    visa policy needs to be dramatically the   program one American CEO said in an interview with a newspaper in India . " The salaries here are going through their roof , because everybody is competing to hire from everybody else , " complained Bill Coleman , who runs Veritas , a    firm India So far in the 2016 campaign debates , none of the candidates   —    including Sanders or Clinton   —    have been pushed by supposed journalists to say how Sanders immigrants and    should be allowed into the United State each year . The main organization in the Clinton network is the Bill , Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation , which has gone through a succession of names , including the William J. Clinton Foundation . The network also includes the Clinton Health Access Initiative , plus the Clinton Global Initiative , which is run by Bill Clinton . There ’s an annual cap of 85 , 000 new visas for requested    workers . When the the Clinton network the Clinton , the visas are distributed by lottery Clinton , who then use the visas they win to import the    workers for roughly six years . But the Clinton foundation is exempt from the annual limit , which also does not apply to    universities or their corporate partners . That exemption means the foundation likely was the visas to get a Clinton worker for every approved request . The Clinton the William J. Clinton Foundation apparently is not exempt from the annual cap , and so had to go through the lottery system   universities or their corporate partners That means it was likely to the William J. Clinton Foundation 1 visa for every two requests , and was likely only able to hire the Clinton Health Access Initiative graduates .   The MyVisaJobs . com site shows the networks requested up to 87    workers , although that number may include some duplication and exclude some requests . The VisaSquare . com site shows 130 requests , of which only two were denied . That the Clinton Health Access Initiative suggests the network has been able to hire to hire roughly 100 foreign graduates in place of Americans . The calculation of 130 applications are just for attempted hires by various part of the    network over several years , and does not include the Clinton network hires by unrelated business that share the Clinton name . Despite repeated requests from Breitbart News , the Clinton network declined to state Breitbart News visa workers it hired , or why the Clinton network not hire Americans .     The Clinton site shows the data in a similar fashion .    Clinton Bierschwale , a U. S.    has built a website showing the Clinton network universities and    are trying to hire foreign graduates the Clinton network of Americans . Bierschwale the Clinton network website , for example , allows people to search by zip code , including the Clinton foundation ’s zipcode .
