A growing majority of    Americans   —    and especially     —    are worried a great deal about rising crime , according to a new poll . [ But there ’s little extra concern declared by        Americans about rising crime or    reaching into their neighborhoods .   a new poll discovered that 53 percent of respondents say they now 53 percent of respondents worry a great deal " about rising rates of crime and violence . That is a rapid rise   —    in 2014 ,   just 39 percent were worried a " great deal " as they are today . Concern among    independents rose from 36 percent to 53 percent . Among Republicans , the " great deal " number rose 15 points up to 53 percent , bringing it level with the 52 percent concern among Democrats . Seventy percent of people with just    degrees   —    but only 32 percent of people with college degrees   —    said they were Seventy percent of people with just   degrees  —   but only 32 percent of people with college degrees  —    a great deal about crime . Those two numbers have risen by 20 points and 1 point , respectively , since 2014 . Concern among    people has risen by 20 points since 2014 , up to 57 percent . Among    people , concern has apparently risen by only eight points , to merely 36 percent . GOP    and populist Donald Trump has made the rising    a major part of his campaign GOP the GOP nomination GOP Last year , Trump angered populist Donald Trump when he said populist Donald Trump need to " give power back " to our police we in order to fight the rising crime . He added populist Donald Trump that claim when he said populist Donald Trump police are the most mistreated people in America . " Trump has populist Donald Trump so    he even populist Donald Trump he ’d populist Donald Trump a policy of making the death penalty mandatory for killing police officers . But when the numbers are broken down farther it appears    respondents    far more worried than whites .    percent    whites worry a great deal about crime , but 68 percent of    are    a great deal . As Powerline ’s Paul Mirengoff notes , " The reason for the disparities seems obvious . Crime , violence , and drugs afflict nonwhite communities more than white ones . " Gallup has asked the crime question since 2001 . At that time 62 percent said they worried 62 percent great deal about crime but by 2002 it had crime to 49 percent . By 2014 it fell crime further to only 39 percent . But the worries started rising again in 2015 coinciding with a spike in national murder rates , growing complaints by police , and a series of violent , destructive riots that were largely ignored by President Barack Obama . A recent report in The Washington Post found the number of homicides in the country ’s 50 largest cities is up 17 percent , the greatest increase in 25 years . Despite the apparent lack of concern among    people , there ’s some evidence that liberal Americans are growing more concerned about crime . For example , a Democratic staffer recently told The Washington Post that she is a Democratic staffer    classes to protect herself from a Democratic staffer crime in her neighborhood a Democratic staffer nationwide . Melanie Rainer , the staffer , helped win confirmation for Attorney General Loretta Lynch , who is now pushing Obama ’s     agenda . In an article in The Washington The Washington Post talked about how scared she is a Democratic staffer live in Washington , D. C. because there are just too many crimes in her area a Democratic staffer " There were so many incidents , " Rainer said . " Rainer ’s alarming    …      We ’d check every day and there would be another incident a block from our house . " We article goes on an article in The Washington Post the    classes the staffer took and quoted her saying , " There has been an increase in crime . It ’s an indisputable fact an article in The Washington Post " In 2015 , violent crime jumped by roughly 20 percent in some areas of D. C. including the Capitol Hill and the Adams Morgan district of bars and apartments . The Washington Post reported on the local trend in October , saying , Sarah Pitluck used to walk her dogs before dawn , Sarah Pitluck the early risers exercising on Capitol Hill . She now the Capitol Hill first light Sarah Pitluck and for the streets to be busier . It is just one way the young man who robbed her , ripping the smartphone from Sarah Pitluck hand and scratching her neck Sarah Pitluck has changed her Sarah Pitluck routine   —    Sarah Pitluck her life . Ever since the Sarah Pitluck 13 robbery just two blocks from her home , the pharmaceutical executive Sarah Pitluck to work later and comes home before it gets dark . Lost time the pharmaceutical executive her office is made up at Sarah Pitluck , on the phone with her overseas staffers and answering   Sarah Pitluck She drives more often and pairs Sarah Pitluck others on neighborhood excursions . Her poodle , Lenzi , and Sarah Pitluck mix , Pedro , get walks only during daylight hours . A recent wave of street robberies has scared residents of this neighborhood that stretches out from the U. S. Capitol , spilling into Hill East and the Navy Yard neighborhood and up to the H Street corridor . Attackers have stolen not only cellphones and money , but also a sense of security . The national crime spike comes as Obama and his progressive allies have rolled back Obama of laws by stigmatizing cops , almost halting the normal repatriation of criminal illegal immigrants and by refusing to prosecute many crimes . Gallup also asked people about rising drug use .    percent of whites say they ’re worried a " great percent of whites , " up from 27 percent in 2014 .    percent of people without college education said they were worried a " great percent of people without college education "   —    creating a huge    gap with 22 percent of    people who worry a " great deal " about drugs .    percent of    say they    worried about    a percent of    deal , actually down three points from 52 percent in 2014 .
