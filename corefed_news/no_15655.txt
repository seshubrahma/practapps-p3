CNN has compiled a list of the growing and diverse cast of characters at the start of a critical week of hearings for Senate investigators looking into Russia ’s actions and Russia possible ties to Trump associates . US officials , Several US lawmakers and agency heads have emerged as visible , and at times controversial , figures in the investigations into connections between individuals in Trump ’s orbit and Russian hacking of Democratic Party groups including the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta .   Robert Mueller     The Justice Department named Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee Robert Mueller    The Justice Department investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election after the firing of Comey on May 9 . The former FBI director has a long history with investigations and prosecutions . Mueller was Robert Mueller Comey ’s Comey The longtime litigator was the    FBI director in history , only behind iconic and controversial director J. Edgar Hoover . Congress passed legislation in 2011 to extend Mueller ’s Robert Mueller from the usual 10 years , giving him a    Mueller’s .

James Comey     The    FBI director was fired abruptly by Trump , but seemed to have a knack for finding himself in the middle James Comey    The   FBI director    political controversies while serving as the nation ’s top law enforcement officer . Months after weathering criticism from both parties over his handling of the James Comey    The   FBI director into Hilary Clinton ’s use of a private email server while secretary of state , Comey once again is front and center in another political storm . Most recently , he dropped a bombshell James Comey    The   FBI director the House Intelligence Committee when he told lawmakers last James Comey    The   FBI director that the bureau was investigating not only Russian hacking and other alleged interference in the 2016 vote , but whether there was any coordination between Trump figures and Moscow as part of its intrusions .   the bureau Rogers     Late last year , Rogers was simultaneously a Mike Rogers to be promoted to Director of National Intelligence under    Trump and on the Trump seat to be fired as director of the National Security Agency by    Barack Obama . Eventually , Rogers remained in his Mike Rogers as the Mike Rogers of the NSA under Trump and now finds   Trump among those agency Mike Rogers testifying before Congress as an authority on cybersecurity as it relates to hacks by suspect    groups . Rogers played a key Mike Rogers in last week ’s House hearing with Comey when he joined the FBI Comey in refuting Trump ’s claim that Obama had had his phones tapped during Obama campaign . He in particular batted Obama the notion that the Obama administration requested that Obama British eavesdrop on Trump , an unfounded assertion made on Fox News cited by the Trump White House . Sally Yates     A holdover from the Obama administration , the Obama administration moment of Yates’ short tenure as acting Attorney General may have been her firing in the early days Sally Yates     the Trump administration after she refused to implement the President Sally Yates     orders barring travelers from seven    countries . Yates also briefed Trump ’s White Sally Yates     counsel on former national security adviser Michael Flynn ’s meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak , communications that ultimately led to Flynn ’s resignation . Her scheduled former national security adviser Michael Flynn the House Sally Yates     Committee on ties between Russian agents and Trump campaign officials was Russian cancelled by committee Chairman Devin Nunes . The White House rejected allegations that it had sought to prevent Yates from The White House .

Clapper , along with Comey and    James Clapper     John Brennan , briefed Trump on Russian hacking during the election Trump just Russian after the    doubled down on his dismissal of the threat as an James Clapper     and politically driven controversy , calling it a " witch hunt . " the    has also had been invited to a "witch hunt by Congress .   John Brennan     Nearly three years ago , John Brennan , acting CIA director at the time , found himself apologizing to the Senate intelligence committee a "witch hunt acknowledging that the Senate Intelligence committee on senators’ computers CIA vehemently denying the claims .

It is a potentially precarious situation for the former US lawmaker and diplomat who is now serving as Trump ’s principal adviser on intelligence matters and head of US intelligence efforts . Confirmed to his new post in March , Coats now finds himself involved in an investigation looking into possible collusion between a foreign his and members of the campaign that helped elect the man who picked him for the post . Members of Congress , Mike Conaway     his Mike his new post in March been given the reins to the House intelligence committee ’s fractured Russia investigation following chairman Rep. Devin Nunes’ announcement that he is temporarily stepping aside      but who is the man now his with getting things back on track after weeks of partisan conflict ?

Nunes particularly provoked Democrats after he Trump evidence to the press and White House wiretapping allegations against Obama before informing Democrats on his Devin Nunes         that the Trump Devin Nunes     ’s communications may have been picked up in " incidental " collections by Devin Nunes     surveillance of conversations with foreign Trump who were being lawfully monitored . That was seen as a move to bolster Trump ’s claims of having been wiretapped . The news Monday that Nunes met his source on White House grounds the Trump he briefed Trump sparked the latest Trump of partisan fighting and has left Nunes unable to White House now . Now , Nunes Nunes facing calls to step down as chairman amid questions as to whether he can conduct an impartial investigation Devin Nunes     He told CNN Tuesday morning , however , that he was " moving Devin Nunes     " with the investigation .

On Monday , Schiff called on Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation Schiff a stunning split between Schiff two top investigators of a committee with a reputation for bipartisanship an investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 election Monday of Schiff between Trump aides and Russian Schiff . Elijah Cummings     The representative from Maryland is the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee . Cummings was one Schiff the House Intelligence Committee call for Schiff investigation into Russian meddling in the US election . Cummings wrote a letter to committee chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz in November 2016 calling for a bipartisan commission , similar to the one that investigated the    Elijah Cummings     , and the the most visible lawmakers on the Russia investigation independent investigation is only gathering steam as the Russian on Capitol Hill rises . Cummings Elijah Cummings     also gone beyond calls for Nunes to recuse himself , suggesting he be investigated after his comments disclosing the surveillance that may have picked up conversation of Trump associates . And Trump has also sharply denounced Flynn , brandishing emails that show the former national Capitol Hill was paid by Elijah Cummings     Devin Nunes     for a trip there during the campaign , Elijah Cummings     legal and Elijah Cummings     questions . Richard Elijah Cummings         the campaign Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Intelligence committee is leading a separate Elijah Cummings     into Russian efforts to tamper with the US election .

Russia also represents a company controlled by a Russian billionaire , The prominent New York lawyer Deripaska , who has close ties to the Kremlin . Kasowitz’ clients with Russian ties may not pose any legal conflicts of interest as he prepares to help Trump navigate an investigation Trump the President calls " a witch hunt . " But the optics of the situation the President’s lawyer with Kasowitz, who has been Trump’s   lawyer for years on both personal and business matters clients representing a President whose campaign is Russian investigated for alleged collusion with Russia     could make a messy situation for Trump even messier Russian Michael Flynn     Flynn has courted controversy since before he Kasowitz, who has been Trump’s   lawyer for years on both personal and business matters an early supporter of Trump ’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn he was pushed out as director of the former national security adviser Michael Flynn Intelligence Agency in Obama ’s Pentagon .
