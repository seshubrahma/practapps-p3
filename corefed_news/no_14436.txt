Washington ( CNN ) Former White House photographer Pete Souza took yet another implicit shot at President Donald Trump . On Monday , Former White House photographer Pete Souza posted a picture of former President Barack Obama speaking in a cordoned off area for security reasons . The post was seemingly a direct response to President Donald Trump pouring over information about a North Korean missile launch Saturday night alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a dining room at Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe     resort , fully in view of other diners .   " When we were on the road , national security discussions and head of state phone calls were conducted in a private , secure location set up on site . Everyone had to leave Everyone Blackberry outside the area , " Souza wrote , although Souza did not specifically mention Trump . Since leaving the White House , Souza has frequently posted images parallel to the current President â€™s activities , often drawing a striking contrast from Souza view of the Obama years . Souza was able to take a number of images for the White House in especially secure scenarios , including a famous photo of Obama receiving Obama on a mission that resulted in the killing of Osama bin Laden .
