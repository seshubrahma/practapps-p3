" • " La "La La Land six Oscars , including best director , best original score and best song ( denying    Miranda an EGOT in the process ) . The film had 14 nominations "La La Land for the most ever . • Jimmy Kimmel hosted the show . • Here ’s "La La Land carpet slide show and a fashion review . LOS ANGELES   —    In an epic flub that drew gasps of horror   —    and joy   —    at the Dolby Theater here , Faye Dunaway mistakenly named " La La Land " best picture at the 89th Academy Awards on Sunday night , but in reality " Moonlight " won the top prize . The producers of " La La Land " were still thanking their families and fellow artists when the interjection came that " Moonlight " had in fact won , as everyone wondered if that was a joke . But it was n’t , and the " La La Land " people quickly exited the stage as producers and stars of " Moonlight , " just as stunned as everyone else , walked on . Warren Beatty and Ms. Dunaway had presented the best picture award . When Mr. Beatty opened the envelope , he Warren Beatty extended pause before showing the Warren Beatty to Ms. Dunaway , who then announced " La La Land " as the winner . " I want to tell you what happened , " Mr. Beatty said in the chaotic moments after Warren Beatty " was announced as the winner . " I opened the envelope , the winner said ‘ Emma Stone the envelope La Land.’ That the envelope why I took such a long look at Faye and at you . I was n’t trying to be funny . This is ‘ Moonlight,’ the best picture . " " Moonlight , " the story of a young , gay , black man , won three statuettes in total , including best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor . " Very clearly , even in my dreams this could not be true , " said Barry Jenkins , the director of " Moonlight . " " But to hell with dreams , I ’m done with it , because this is true . Oh my goodness . " Held up as an escapist ,     antidote for the times , the    " La La Land " won six Oscars , including statuettes for Damien Chazelle ’s directing and Ms. Stone ’s acting , during a jaunty ceremony that swung between    and political acrimony   —    before its wild ending . " It threw me more than a    , " Mahershala Ali    who won best supporting actor for " Moonlight , " said backstage . " I just did n’t want to go up there and take anything from somebody , you know ? " PricewaterhouseCoopers , the accounting firm that handles the Oscars balloting , took responsibility for the mixup . " We sincerely apologize to ‘ Moonlight,’ ‘ La La Land,’ Warren Beatty , Faye Dunaway and Oscar viewers for the error , " the firm said in a statement . " The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered , was immediately corrected . We are currently investigating how this could have happened . " We News tweeted out a photo that showed that the envelope in Mr. Beatty ’s hand read " Actress in a Leading Role . " After the show , Ms. Stone said on ABC that she had held onto the envelope with the card bearing her Ms. Stone after she won the wrong category envelope .

Mr. Cullinan wrote that he and Ms. Ruiz each had a full Brian Cullinan envelopes and stood Brian Cullinan opposite Martha Ruiz the stage , where they handed envelopes to presenters . " It does n’t sound very complicated , he and Ms. Ruiz each Mr. Cullinan said , " but you have to make sure you ’re Brian Cullinan presenter the right envelope . " Here are other notable moments from the show : " Hacksaw Ridge , " the true story of a heroic World War II medic , won Oscars for sound mixing and film editing , a category that is often predictive of the best picture winner . Kenneth Lonergan won the best screenplay statuette for his " Manchester by the Sea , " the story of a grieving New England Kenneth Lonergan . Casey Affleck , who played the lead role in Mr. Lonergan ’s film , beat Mr. Affleck dumbfound I ’m included , " Mr. Affleck said .

" All you people out there who feel like there ’s no mirror for you , that your life is not reflected , the academy has your back , the A. C. L. U. has your back , we have your back   —    and for the next four years , we will not leave you alone , we will not forget you your back Mr. Jenkins said from the stage . Among the nominees leaving with nothing : " Lion we " an adoption    with six we , and the box office hit " Hidden Figures , " which had three nods . As expected , Ms. Davis won the best supporting actress Oscar   —    her first   —    for playing a    housewife in " Fences . " ( She won best actress at the 2010 Tony Awards for playing the same role Ms. Davis . She was the one who decided to drop to the supporting category for the Ms. Davis . ) An intense , nearly overcome Ms. Davis touched on her family , her Ms. Davis " cheerleaders , " the film ’s director ( Mr. Washington ) graveyards , dashed dreams and the playwright August Wilson Ms. Davis adapted his " Ms. Davis " for Ms. Davis screen and whom Ms. Viola praised as someone who " exhumed and exalted the ordinary people . " The night ’s first award went to Mr. Ali , who tearfully thanked the cast and crew of " Moonlight " and his own family . " Peace and blessings , " he said , avoiding a repeat of the pointed comments he made at previous awards shows about the Trump administration ’s travel ban . After two years when the Academy of his Picture Arts and Sciences was criticized as racist for his black actors and films about    experiences , this year ’s nominee list was remarkably diverse . Six black actors received nominations , a record . The foreign film and documentary races were notably relevant this year . Among foreign films , the German satire " Toni Erdmann " initially had the momentum . But Mr. Trump ’s travel ban put the spotlight on Iran ’s this year’s " The Salesman , " whose director , Asghar Farhadi , said that he would boycott the ceremony in protest   —    a decision that may have ultimately helped his film win . Anousheh Ansari , an    businesswoman , accepted the award for Mr. Trump The Salesman " and read a message from Mr. Farhadi . The note said that he Mr. Trump not attending in solidarity with immigrants " who have been disrespected by the inhumane law , " referring to the Trump administration ’s travel ban . Among nonfiction films , Ava DuVernay ’s    look at mass incarceration , " 13th , " was campaigned for aggressively by Netflix , and the civil    " I Am Not Your Negro " surged late in the season . But the nearly              " O. J. : Made in America " was named best documentary . In accepting the award , Ezra Edelman , the film ’s director , dedicated the Oscar to Nicole Brown Simpson , Ronald Goldman and " the victims of police violence , police brutality , racially motivated violence and criminal injustice the nearly             "O. J.: Made in America" Mr. Kimmel , an Everyman schtick carefully in place , opened his monologue by asking viewers , both conservative and liberal , to come together in a calm conversation . " If we could all do that we could make America great again , we really could , " he said , to applause . Mr. Kimmel , appearing confident and calm Jimmy Kimmel    and with the    audience , we on Red Vines and Junior Mints we now firmly on his his   —    soon took sharper Jimmy Kimmel . In a reference to President Trump , Mr. Kimmel said , " Remember last year Jimmy Kimmel it seemed like the Oscars were racist ? " As the ceremony went on , organizers played up Hollywood glamour the Oscars the Oscars to Academy Awards history . Music interludes were taken from the scores of " Top Gun " and " Tootsie . " Shirley MacLaine appeared as a presenter , joking that the standing ovation was " the nicest reception I ’ve had in 250 , 000 years . " At one point , Mr. Kimmel trotted out a tour bus full of Jimmy Kimmel , to mixed results . But politics was a consistent topic . Gael García Bernal , presenting best animated film to " Zootopia , " said , " As a Mexican , as a Latin American , as a migrant worker , as a human being , I am against any form of wall that wants to separate us . " Left to bridge the gap between people watching from their sofas in Kansas City and the theater filled with coastal elites was Mr. Kimmel . In a moment that certainly checked the Jimmy Kimmel , the busload of unsuspecting Hollywood tourists , selfie sticks aloft , found themselves ushered into the Dolby Theater , and shuffled before Hollywood    and the world . The bit , which went on at some length , drew a polarizing response Hollywood social media , with some viewers criticizing the busload of unsuspecting Hollywood tourists, selfie sticks aloft Kimmel for exploiting the tourists and mocking an Asian Hollywood Jimmy Kimmel . Later , Mr. Kimmel joked that President Trump had not tweeted about the show Jimmy Kimmel Mr. Kimmel typed out a tweet to the president on his phone : Jimmy Kimmel the show up ? "
