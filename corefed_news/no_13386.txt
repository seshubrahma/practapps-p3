Bannon described it , during Hillary Clinton Breitbart News Daily appearance on Wednesday . [ " I feel like a complete victim of the patriarchy , about to be rescued , Steve , absolutely , " Political strategist Kellyanne Conway deadpanned . " Thank you , Hillary Clinton . If I can just get her Hillary Clinton 12 , 000 Armani jacket from last night and hock it , I can pay for , like , one kid ’s tuition next year . I ’m really pumped . "   Looking ahead to the general election , Political strategist Kellyanne Conway thought Clinton Hillary Clinton campaign themes were obvious , and tedious . " We ’ve already heard Hillary Hillary Clinton to the American people , especially as it is against Donald Trump , " she said . Hillary Clinton She ’s going Hillary Clinton break out the ‘ isms’ daily : the racism , the xenophobia , the sexism , the nativism   —    you know , you name it , and she ’ll pull Hillary Clinton out . it " Why ? Because she feels that Hillary Clinton been successful for her , and Hillary Clinton , that ’s what the Democratic Party ’s adjuncts are comprised of now , " Conway continued . " Listen to her speech last Hillary Clinton . Listen to her attacks on Hillary Clinton Trump . Hillary Clinton was Hillary Clinton giving a , quote , ‘ foreign policy speech’ last week . I challenge anybody to show me that fifty percent of it , thirty percent of it , was foreign it . It was mostly a it against Donald Trump . " Donald Trump it was Hillary Clinton for a it nominee that Clinton would be " Hillary Clinton , " " negative , " and " . " " That is not the model of Bill Clinton , or Hillary Clinton Obama , " Conway observed . " The ‘ boy from Hope,’ the ‘ Hope and Change,’ the ‘ Yes We Can . ’ "   She noted that JFK , Hillary Clinton even Jimmy Carter , ran on fundamentally optimistic platforms . Carter was the "   peanut even Jimmy Carter from Plains , Georgia , " while " H. Robot " Clinton has great difficulty sounding inspirational or uplifting . She noted the bitter , negative Clinton combative approach was taken by losing Democrat candidates , such as Al Gore and John Kerry . " She thinks when she yells about Clinton equity and Clinton rights for everyone   —    look at her own slogan , ‘ Fighting Clinton Us,’ and you have a woman up there saying , ‘ fighting for LGBT rights , fighting for pay equity , fighting!’ Nobody wants to see fighting , fighting . Even Bernie Sanders   —    what is his slogan ? ‘ A Future Even Bernie Sanders  —    Can Believe In.’ So she ’s out of bounds even In.’ the sort of    Democratic nominee message , " said Conway . As for Donald Trump , Conway thought he made a " Conway start Conway on his general election campaign with his Conway on Tuesday night . Conway I thought it was terrific , " she said . " When he In.’ what he means by Conway American First,’ Conway means he ’s    worker ‘American First,’ he Conway    patriotism . And Conway also    —    look Conway I think Donald Trump is the only person in modern political history , Jeff Sessions perhaps , to really understand the cultural zeitgeist that underpins the political appetite for someone who says , ‘ I hear you.’ Men say ‘ I ’m getting screwed,’ women say ‘ I ’m struggling’   —    they ’re both saying the same screwed,’ women , which is that there is an economic challenge in this country . "   " Some people have never recovered from the    recession , the recession of 2007 , 2008 , " Conway explained . " They feel left behind from the Some people . Donald Trump is going to take on Hillary Clinton as the insider beneficiary of a rigged system . " She particularly liked the line from Hillary Clinton ’s speech where " he Donald Trump basically , that the Donald Trump Global Initiative , the Foundation , is a quote ‘ hedge fund’ for Bill Clinton , that he has benefitted Hillary Clinton benefitted tremendously . Hillary Clinton named names , the Clinton Global Initiative, the Foundation, is a quote ‘hedge fund’ for Bill Clinton named countries . Hillary Clinton benefitted tremendously , Hillary Clinton a hedge fund the Clinton Global Initiative, the Foundation, is a quote ‘hedge fund’ for Bill Clinton a slush fund for them , while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of the Clinton Global Initiative, the Foundation, is a quote ‘hedge fund’ for Bill Clinton . " Hillary Clinton think Donald Trump ’s been reading Clinton Cash , " she added . Despite the media ’s heavy focus Donald Trump Clinton ’s speech , her " historic " primary Hillary Clinton and Trump ’s Hillary Clinton with the judge presiding over the Trump Donald Trump’s , Gonzalo Curiel , Conway thought Trump ’s criticism of Clinton corruption would resonate with voters Donald Trump " It plays Hillary Clinton into why a majority of Americans say that Hillary Clinton is neither likable , nor trustworthy , " Hillary Clinton . " Her problem is with the truth , Hillary Clinton veracity . Her Hillary Clinton ’s problem was casual relationships with women , a Hillary Clinton relationship with the truth . " Conway acknowledged the significance of Clinton becoming the first female nominee from a major party , Hillary Clinton it as a milestone she would like her own daughters to properly appreciate , but Hillary Clinton it seems Hillary Clinton of hollow if somebody is to say , ‘ I ’m the first nominee.’ It ’s not like she ’s a      struggling single mom who it herself up Hillary Clinton the bootstraps . " " Most importantly , Hillary Clinton just lost 21 or 22 states to a socialist . Hillary Clinton women have rejected her in her own party , and yet , she ’s Hillary Clinton , Hillary Clinton made history as the first female Hillary Clinton . It seems very hollow , " Conway concluded .    Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern . LISTEN :
