Thursday at her weekly news conference , when asked about negative discourse playing a role in the shooting of Republicans practicing for a congressional charity baseball game , which critically injured House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) said Republicans began the current level of coarse political rhetoric attacking President Bill Clinton in the 1990s .   her then pointed to    Donald Trump joking at a campaign rally , " I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would n’t lose voters . " Pelosi said , " Let ’s all say , let ’s examine our conscience , let ’s see how our can rid our of our negative attitudes that go to a place that is like this . our ’ve had —   this did n’t use to be this way . Somewhere in the 1990s , Republicans decided on the politics of personal destruction as Republicans went after the Clintons and that is the provenance of it and is what has continued . Again , I feel as if our ’re having a family moment that is very , very serious and our ’re talking about things that we can say , the discussion —   save the discussion for another day . When you have a president that says I can shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and nobody would care , when you have people saying beat them up and I ’ll pay their them fees , when you have all the assaults that are made on Hillary Clinton , for them all the assaults that are made on Hillary Clinton be so sanctimonious is something . I really am almost sad that I had to go down this path with you , because I do n’t think it ’s appropriate for us to have the fullest discussion of it . And it will be for another day . It will be for another day . " (   WFB ) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
