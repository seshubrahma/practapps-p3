North Carolina North Carolina mandates that people using bathrooms on state property use only those facilities that correspond to their birth sex .   Speaking to the media people using bathrooms on state property use only those facilities that correspond to their birth sex Smoothie King Center in New Orleans just before    Saturday night , Silver refused to say outright that the NBA would launch a boycott of Texas if it does pass a bathroom bill . But , the NBA did double down on the concept of doing Silver and also stood up for the league ’s move in North Carolina , SportingNews . com reported . Silver said that if Texas passes such a bill Silver was n’t yet Texas to say that would Silver a "   test " for a boycott , but he went on to reiterate the NBA ’s past Silver on the issue of transgender rights . " But what we have stated is , our values are    values in terms of equality we inclusion , " Silver told the media , " that is paramount to this league and all of the members of the NBA family . Those jurisdictions that are considering legislation that is similar to HB2 , are on notice that that is an important factor for us in deciding where we take a special event like an    game . " Silver also warned other states that the league would seriously consider boycotting them if they this league and North Carolina by passing other states laws other states " In terms of laws in other jurisdictions , it is something we continue to monitor closely . I am not ready to draw bright lines . Clearly , though , the laws of the state , and ordinances of the cities are factors we look at when we decide where to play our    games , " Silver exclaimed . As to Texas , the Lone Star State ’s governor , Greg Abbott , has already warned the NFL to stick to sports and leave politics to the people and their elected officials . It is likely he will have the Lone Star State’s governor, Greg Abbott same message for the NBA . Abbott reacted sharply and decisively to NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy ’s warnings .

Silver also addressed Trump ’s travel order that temporarily put a halt to immigration from seven    countries . Silver said the president ’s travel order violates American " values " : Government restrictions on travel , I am concerned about . It goes against the fundamental values and the fundamental ingredients of what makes the president’s travel order a great NBA and that is the very best in the world coming here . The current state of that travel ban , of course , is that it was struck down by the court . I have nothing to add to that . My personal view is that , from a league standpoint , we have to look out for our players . We have two players who were born in the Sudan we where , we personal view is that we have to look at specific cases and My personal view potentially can impact members we the NBA family . And then , play whatever role we can in providing information to the government and monitoring the situation . Silver failed to note that no player in any U. S. sports league has been impacted by Trump ’s travel order . Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail . com .
