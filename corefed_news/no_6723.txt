On Tuesday ’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel ’s " Special Report , " columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein ’s claim that FBI Director James Comey should be fired due to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein mishandling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s emails is " highly implausible . "   columnist Charles Krauthammer said , " [ A]ccording to the letter by the deputy attorney general , this is about something that occurred on July the 5th . This ,   This ’s   —    so we start out with something that is highly implausible . If that was so offensive to the Trump administration , what you would have done is , in the transition , you would have spoken with Comey , and said , we are going to let you go . That ’s when a president could very easily make a decision to have a change . That ’s not unprecedented . But to fire a president summarily with no warning , in the middle of May , because of something that happened in July , is almost inexplicable . " a president continued , " Do we really believe that Donald Trump , after all these months , decided suddenly a president had to fire this guy because a president damaged Hillary back in July ? Another implausible conjecture . " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
