Did Donald Trump underperform based on Marquess of Queensberry rules . Perhaps he did Donald Trump underperform based on Marquess of Queensberry But the dynamics of this race the race same . It ’s the the race candidate versus the competent insider and I just do n’t know that people going to work this morning who want change are going to say , ‘ Oh , OK . I ’m going to go for the person that , you know , that ticked off the policy prescriptions better than the other . ’ " " Donald Trump undercuts all of that by saying , ‘ You ’ve been othere 35 years,’ " he continued . Donald Trump If you had all of these great ideas , why did n’t you implement them over 35 you had all of these great ideas That ’s just a really strong powerful argument and I do n’t know that this debate does anything to change any dynamic .
