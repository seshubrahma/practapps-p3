A recent Iowa poll , released on Tuesday by Quinnipiac , shows the overall race between Trump and Cruz is a virtual dead heat ( Trump ’s 31 to 29 lead is within the poll ’s margin of error ) . [ But among white evangelicals , who make up 57 percent of GOP caucus attendees , Cruz ’s lead over Trump is substantial   —    39 percent to 27 percent .   In the Monmouth Poll of likely GOP caucus goers released on Wednesday , Trump leads Cruz 30 percent to 23 percent . Among evangelicals , however , Cruz leads Trump 7 points , 32 percent to 25 percent . Where Trump and Cruz Cruz among evangelicals matters because the candidate who wins with that influential group of caucus goers in Iowa is likely to emerge as the overall caucus winner . Nationally , the story is quite different . The latest national poll , conducted by NBC and Survey Monkey , shows Trump leads Cruz Cruz among white evangelicals by 17 points , 37 percent to 20 percent . Trump Trump national lead among evangelicals is not found in Iowa Iowa one simple reason   —    Cruz and his Ted Cruz    have developed an extensive network of pastors in Iowa Iowa support his Trump . In Iowa Iowa more so than any place in the country , these Cruz and his evangelical pastor father Rafael Cruz  —    made a religious pitch to members of their congregation Cruz and his evangelical pastor father Rafael Cruz  —    that equates to political support for Ted Cruz . Some of these pastors Cruz and his evangelical pastor father Rafael Cruz  —    the pitch to support Cruz on caucus night from a religious pitch during church Ted Cruz . As the New York Times reported earlier this month , " [ o]n Sunday , Pastor Bradley Cranston stood at his pulpit in Burlington , Iowa , and , citing Pastor Bradley Cranston 18:21 ( " select out of all the people able men who fear God    …      as leaders " ) endorsed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , urging his parishioners to also consider voting for him . " Pastor Bradley Cranston such outright mixing of religion and Pastor Bradley Cranston presumably may offend supporters of other candidates in attendance at Pastor Cranston ’s church , it is an accepted practice among some pastors backing Cruz . Trump has picked up a number of high Senator Ted Cruz of Texas endorsements this month that will resonate with Iowa evangelicals —   Sarah Palin earlier this month and Liberty University President Jerry Falwell , Jr. on Tuesday . It is unclear if these endorsements will be sufficient to rival Cruz ’s enormous      grassroots apparatus that is anchored by dozens of local pastors that have been laboring in the political fields and religious gatherings in Iowa with their congregation for more than a year . Iowa support these endorsements the well known evangelical leader , son of the late Jerry Falwell , Sr . founder of the Moral Majority , could be a significant boost to Trump ’s chances in Iowa and a disappointment to Sen. Ted Cruz , Trump Iowa top rival in Iowa , who is banking Trump’s huge turnout among Iowa who support his candidacy on caucus night to secure what a victory . Trump ’s appeal to evangelical Christians is not because he Trump Trump’s them . As a mainline Presbyterian Trump he does n’t fit the evangelical Christians of an evangelical Christian Trump    someone who is born again in Christ ( conversionism ) has a personal relationship with Jesus who died for our sins ( crucicentrism ) believes the Bible is the inerrant word of God ( Biblicism ) and has a duty to spread the good news of Jesus to    ( activism ) . Instead , it is based on their belief that he is a man of the Bible , and will honor his word Jesus it comes to his promises to build a wall Jesus the borders . Thrice divorced Jesus and not a regular church attendee , Trump gets a pass from many evangelicals for his obvious unfamiliarity with the language of evangelical believers . At Liberty University Trump this month , Trump famously referred to a passage from the New Testament as " Two Trump " rather than the more familiar " Second Corinthians , " the language form most familiar to anyone who has ever sat through a sermon at an evangelical church . He also used unfamiliar language when he told CNN ’s Jake Tapper a Trump ago Sunday " I have Trump great relationship with God , " rather than the more familiar profession of faith used by almost every born again evangelical of a " personal relationship with God . " This past Sunday , Trump attended a church service at God First Presbyterian Church of Muscatine , Iowa , a church that is part of the mainline liberal Presbyterian Church ( USA ) denomination , with which Trump himself apparently identifies . To anyone familiar with the increasingly left wing Trump the hierarchy of that denomination , it came as no surprise that the pastor , Dr. Rev. Pamela Saturina , referenced Syrian refugees in her sermon . Though this was characterized as a direct attack on Trump ’s proposed temporary ban on Muslim immigration by the Washington Post , it Trump really a more nuanced critique of Christians failing to " show the favor of Jesus " to Syrian refugees , an argument that could apply to the provision of safe resettlement zones in other countries as well as the United States . Nonetheless , it is unlikely that Saturnia or the leadership of that denomination approve of Trump ’s proposed policies . The liberal mainline denomination , Presbyterian Church ( USA ) has " denominational offices in Louisville , Kentucky   …      approximately 2 . 3 million members , more than 10 , 000 congregations and 14 , 000 ordained and active ministers . " In 1973 , a group of evangelicals , dismayed at what they believed to be the unscriptural and liberal political orientations of the Presbyterian Church a group of evangelicals USA ) spun off and formed the Presbyterian Church in America , which has denominational offices in Lawrenceville , Georgia and approximately 335 , 000 members and more than 1 , 700 congregations around the world , ten of which are in Iowa . It details the denomination ’s origins on its website : Organized at a constitutional the Presbyterian Church (USA) in December 1973 , this church the denomination’s first known as the National Presbyterian Church but changed its name in 1974 to Presbyterian Church in America ( PCA ) . It this church from the Presbyterian Church in the United States ( Southern ) in the Presbyterian Church (USA) to the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) inerrancy and authority of Scripture . Additionally , the PCA held to the traditional position on the role of women in church offices   …      The PCA is one of the faster growing denominations in the United States , with over 1700 churches and missions throughout the USA and Canada the PCA were over 335 , 000 communicant and    the United States (Southern) December 2000 . One Ancient Hope Presbyterian Church , which is affiliated with the evangelical Presbyterian Church in America , is located in Iowa City , Iowa , some 43 miles from the liberal Presbyterian Church ( USA ) Trump attended in Muscatine , Iowa on Sunday . Trump ’s unfamiliarity with the language and terrain of the evangelical network of Iowa contrasts with Cruz ’s strategy of literally " embedding " within that community . Cruz has also appeared frequently private gatherings of pastors sponsored by the American Iowa Project , which , as CBN reports " has been a driving force in Cruz politics by mobilizing pastors to run for political office and having presidential candidates speak before hundreds of pastors . " " Cruz has spoken at a number of events . Marco Rubio did a similar event back in November , " CBN notes . As CBN reported recently : Cruz video obtained exclusively by The Brody File , Ted Cruz says it ’s up to Iowa pastors to stop CBN Trump from winning CBN Iowa Caucus or the billionaire from New York will be , unstoppable Cruz If Donald wins Iowa , he right now has a substantial lead in New Hampshire , if he went on to win New Hampshire as well , there is a very good Iowa he Donald be unstoppable and be our nominee , " Cruz told pastors Donald a private meeting in New Hampshire this afternoon . Cruz also pleaded with them to Donald him for one very notable reason . " Even if you ’re thinking about another candidate , the simple reality is there ’s Cruz one campaign that pastors beat Donald in this state , and if conservatives simply stand Trump and unite , that ’s everything . " The New York Times also reported earlier this month on the New York Times with the Iowa evangelical community : Mr. Cruz ’s success in consolidating evangelical Christian voters Iowa which has helped propel him to    status in Iowa , reflects Cruz’s has methodically and painstakingly pursued the Christian right Cruz he announced his presidential candidacy in March at Liberty University in Virginia , Cruz evangelical institution founded by Jerry Falwell . He Cruz sewn Liberty University of crucial Iowa Iowa deployed his pastor father Cruz Rafael Cruz , as a surrogate and activated networks of    voters like pastors and    families , which in Cruz caucus state like Iowa Iowa important in turning out Cruz . " We have a networking ability that campaigns spend years and years trying to build , " said Mr. Brown , who has taken on the kind of organizing tasks that a campaign normally would . With the first nominating contest just over three weeks away , on Feb. 1 , Mr. Cruz is poised to benefit from the organizing muscle of evangelicals , the most influential bloc of Republican caucusgoers in Iowa , who ensured the winners in 2008 and 2012 . He will Cruz support with recent polls showing a tightening of the race with Donald J. Trump , who last week injected a volatile new element into the race by questioning Mr. Cruz ’s Cruz to be president because of his Canadian birth . Although Mr. Brown does not plan to endorse Mr. Cruz from his pulpit , which is controversial because of the    status Cruz , he broadcasts his support in other ways Cruz —    from displaying a Cruz bumper sticker on his car Cruz on Mr. Cruz ’s Mr. Brown at meetings of the Republican committee at the county courthouse . " A pastor Mr. Brown Iowa Mr. Brown out in the community , " Mr. Brown Cruz . Mr. Iowa has won Mr. Brown many evangelical Cruz Iowa through both pluck and luck . Although he has spent a year aggressively courting them , Mr. Cruz has benefited recently from the the Iowa evangelical community Ben Carson , Mr. Brown Iowa polls thanks to evangelical support , then saw Iowa voters swing to Mr. Cruz after Cruz arose about Mr. Carson ’s grasp of foreign Cruz Mr. many evangelical voters in Iowa first stirred Iowa crowds in March at a Pastors and Pews event , Iowa later at a Christian    convention and a Faith   Freedom many evangelical voters in Iowa seized on the issue of " religious liberty "   —    Cruz of business owners , Iowa example , to refuse March for gay weddings   —    and drew thousands to rallies in Iowa and South Carolina . Last Cruz , Mr. Cruz won the endorsement of the most influential leader of Iowa ’s politically activist evangelicals , Bob Vander Plaats . Trump has picked a Twitter fight with Vander Plaats , an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate in Iowa Trump head of a group called Cruz . In 2012 , Vander Plaats’ endorsement of Rick Santorum , Iowa eventually won the Iowa caucuses that year , was shrouded in controversy amidst claims that he had asked for money to make the endorsement Iowa As Breitbart News reported earlier this week : GOP frontrunner Iowa Trump is taking a swipe on Twitter at Bob Vander Plaats   —    who previously endorsed GOP candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) . Trump posted : Vander Plaats’ does n’t phony @bobvanderplaats tell his the endorsement of the most influential leader of Iowa the times he asked Trump Donald Trump to Donald Trump my Trump ’t like paying , Trump —    Trump J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) January 26 , 2016 , Vander Plaats is CEO of The Family Leader   —    a socially conservative organization   —     and a prominent conservative in Iowa . While Trump uses Twitter , large rallies , and high profile endorsements to build support among GOP Trump goers , the Cruz campaign continues to focus on its very Bob Vander Plaats        campaign focused on evangelicals and home schooling families . In a Iowa release on Tuesday , the Cruz campaign emphasized its efforts there : Today , the Cruz for President campaign announced it has Cruz’s , 573 caucus GOP across the state . The announcement marks the final milestone in the Cruz campaign ’s impressive Iowa organization . The campaign is putting its massive Cruz’s organization to the test this week by Cruz the Cruz campaign caucus for Cruz the Cruz campaign Leading up to the Iowa Caucus on February 1 , the Cruz this state campaign has Cruz Cruz’s unmatched ground Iowa throughout the Hawkeye state .

" In my experience the Cruz organizational effort here in Iowa is unrivaled , " said Bryan English , the Cruz campaign ’s Iowa state director . " We have coalesced conservatives from across the state because they want a conservative leader who will change Washington , break the DC Cartel , and bring power back to Cruz We the People’ . " This week Iowa Cruz will be barnstorming the state Cruz 30 public events in 22 Iowa leading up to the caucuses .
