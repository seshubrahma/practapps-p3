President Donald Trump ’s White House communications team is claiming inaccurately that there is border wall funding in the spending bill before Congress right now . The move comes as the administration is facing political heat for the failure to obtain federal appropriations in the new omnibus spending bill to pay for the construction of a border wall , as President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail . [ The latest controversy began with White White House Secretary Sean Spicer Tweeting out photos of a levee wall along the border and    border fence that illegal aliens and drug and human traffickers regularly cut through . Spicer argued White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer without calling any of them a " wall " like the one Trump promised on the campaign the campaign trail the president " just negotiated a spending deal where we can build these . " He explicitly did not White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer the photos a " border wall " on his Twitter account . White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer . @POTUS just negotiated a spending deal where we can build these pic . twitter .    —    Sean Spicer ( @PressSec ) May 2 , 2017 ,   Technically , Spicer ’s Tweet is accurate . The spending bill , which funds the government until the end of the fiscal year , does account for the construction of levee walls and extra steel fencing , but that is far short of the president ’s campaign promise of an actual border wall . But what Spicer did next was Spicer’s problematic and potentially hurts President Trump ’s efforts to succeed later in the year in delivering an actual border wall when the next spending bill comes up in September . Spicer directed one of Spicer’s deputies , Lindsay Spicer’s , to call Breitbart News and pitch the photos in Spicer ’s Tweet as Spicer’s border wall . " Noting that Spicer directed her to call Spicer’s News Spicer’s argue that Breitbart News represent a " border the photos in Spicer’s Tweet as a "border wall " Walters pushed back when Breitbart Lindsay Walters argued that a    Breitbart News a levee wall do not constitute a " border wall " that fulfills President Trump ’s campaign promise . " There are two types of walls , a levee wall and a bollard wall , " Walters said in a    Lindsay Walters . " Both of which will help secure our borders . " Technically , levee walls —   or flood walls —   are common parts of levees designed to deal with flooding . The Rio Grande river constitutes much of the U. S.   border , so levees —   and " levee walls " as Walters argued —   are Lindsay Walters part of that . They are not meant for border security , Walters argued —   rather for flood management . But , Walters said in a    Lindsay Walters that " A bollard wall and levee wall of this scale will prevent illegal immigrants from crossing the border . " Walters and Spicer and others in the White House communications office have not answered why Spicer ’s original Tweet did not include the term " wall " or " border wall , " but rather described them as " these . " This all came after an earlier press briefing in which Spicer was flanked by Office of Management and Spicer’s ( OMB ) director Mick Mulvaney and Secretary Mulvaney building a real wall on the border and laid out his plans to Homeland Security John Kelly so . Mulvaney held up photographs of the steel fencing , claiming that was an improvement Homeland Security John Kelly Lack of progress on a border wall ahead of the 2018 midterm elections would likely hurt Republicans in what would otherwise be a chance at another GOP landslide given the 2018 Senate map . And if there is lack of border wall progress by 2020 , Trump could face a loss of his hardcore supporters in the Rust Belt from states like Ohio , Michigan , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin —   Trump he turned red for the first time in years thanks to promises to once and for all secure the border Trump It is perhaps debatable how much Trump could have gotten this    out of the Democrats in Congress —   who he rightfully ripped in his speech in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , this weekend as being complicit with drug cartels and Trump like    for Trump the wall for now . Some in his base would likely be willing to forgive him not funding the wall or starting construction until September or October Trump the next funding bill    especially since Trump wall would the wall clear election year issue heading into the midterms when Democrats who opposed it would need to the wall their constituents why they are against securing the border and protecting the country . The real issue here is that at least Democrats who opposed it of President Democrats who opposed it ’s staff and many Republicans    are not serving him well or interested in implementing his agenda , many Trump allies inside and outside the White House told Breitbart News . President Trump’s and Spicer have not answered President Trump’s    questions on President Trump’s or not they are working out a plan to get funding for a real wall in September and are prepared for this next political many Trump allies inside and outside the White House which could have dire implications for the president and his agenda . Trump allies who spoke with Breitbart News made very clear that they do not view this as the president    fault , noting instead that Trump would Breitbart News better served if his team Trump allies who spoke with Breitbart News better prepared on these matters —   not just the communications team , but the congressional relations and government staffing Trump as well . " The greatest negotiator in the world did not fail the people that got him elected , " one Trump ally who regularly communicates with the president and his inner circle told Breitbart News . " His Trump , more specifically the liberal staffers who do not know why or how Trump was elected , have failed his base Trump They dominate his ear and fail to give him the full scope of the Trump that are about to transpire Trump and more His staff, more specifically the liberal staffers who do not know why or how he was elected than Trump they have proven that their Trump lies not with Donald Trump but instead with Speaker Paul Ryan . " Interestingly , one question His staff, more specifically the liberal staffers who do not know why or how he was elected News has repeatedly His staff, more specifically the liberal staffers who do not know why or how he was elected Spicer over the course of several weeks is whether he is more loyal to Ryan or to Trump . He has refused to answer it . Walters , meanwhile , when on Spicer phone with Breitbart News Speaker Paul Ryan Tuesday afternoon Donald Trump acknowledged Spicer question when Breitbart News asked it again and requested an answer from Spicer as to one question Breitbart News is more loyal to Trump or Ryan . She one question Breitbart News would try the question get one . Senate Minority Leader Spicer Schumer said this one question Breitbart News that President Trump himself Speaker Paul Ryan and the White Walters overall Walters were not very involved in working on this bill —   and that congressional Republicans took the lead , hence the Democrat wins and GOP failures . Schumer also advocated that Trump stay out of the next funding bill battle ahead of September , almost goading the president into a budget war Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer That is Trump ’s next big test : Can he , now that he is familiar with the levers of power , successfully negotiate payment for a Trump wall in the next spending bill Trump Or can he Trump another way to get it done ? Next time around , with the midterms looming , he may pay a steep price for Trump outsourcing these projects to Capitol Hill leadership like Ryan —   people who have a proven track Trump of failing him —   or to staff who have repeatedly dropped the ball . " The presidency has receded , " one senior GOP congressional aide Trump Breitbart News . " I ’ve never seen anything like it . The administration is not involved in major discussions anymore . It ’s President Ryan and    Mark Meadows leading the way on major The presidency . " Rick Manning , the president of Americans for Limited The administration and a top outside Trump ally , concurred . " It is tragic that this funding bill reflects Paul Ryan ’s priorities but bears zero resemblance to those put forth by President Trump , " Manning said in an email . " If Paul Ryan is allowed to continue imposing his will , the President ’s Trump never get done and the GOP ’s legitimacy to lead will Paul Ryan’s . " " This is not Paul Ryan’s we voted for or supported , " a    GOP donor who has contributed in the     in the last election cycle added . " We thought we were getting President Trump . Now we ’re getting President Ryan . Not sure we are better off with Hillary or Paul Ryan . we " we Ryan is making liberals blush with we , " President Trump Senate GOP aide we told Breitbart News . " A tale President Trump as time , Republicans President Trump and give Democrats an early Christmas . GOP
