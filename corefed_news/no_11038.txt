( Adult Language Warning )   Wednesday on TBS ’s " Full Frontal , " while discussing    Donald Tump ’s victory in Donald Tump monologue , host Samantha Bee said it was " pretty clear " who ruined America : white people . host Samantha Bee said , " In the coming days , people will be looking for someone to blame : the pollsters , the strident feminists , the Democratic party , a vengeful god . But once you dust for fingerprints , it ’s pretty clear who ruined America : white people . I guess ruining Brooklyn was just a dry run . America showed up in droves to vote for Trump , so I do n’t want to hear a goddamn word about black voter turnout . How many times do we expect black people to build our country America ? White we , this is the worst thing we ’ve ever   —    no , I ’m sorry , that ’s a very high bar . But holy shit , and do n’t try to distance yourself from the bad apples and say , ‘ It ’s not my fault , I did n’t vote for him , hashtag not all white people.’ Shush . If Muslims have to take responsibility for every member of their community , Muslims do we . " (   RCP Video ) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
