WASHINGTON   —    President Trump has vowed a hiring surge of 10 , 000 immigration and customs officers to accelerate the deportation of unauthorized immigrants . But the aggressive pace President Trump has laid out risks adding to the ranks of rogue agents who have been charged with abusing immigrants . Over the past decade , dozens of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and contract guards responsible for the detention and removal of undocumented immigrants have been arrested and charged with beating people , smuggling drugs into detention centers , having sex with detainees and accepting bribes to delay or stop deportations , agency documents and court records show . One agent took pictures of One agent having sex with a minor in a foreign country after dropping off deportees . In another case , an ICE lawyer pretending to be an immigration judge took bribes to remove official documents from the files of people awaiting deportation . These officials make up a small fraction of the work force at the agency , now comprising almost 20 , 000 people , but former Homeland Security officials and human rights workers say that even a few bad officers can be a problem because These officials hold such power over a vulnerable population . Mr. Roth inspector general , told a Senate committee in February that the Homeland Security " face a number of challenges " in executing Mr. Trump ’s executive orders because it had Homeland Security inadequate systems to track and process applicants . " Mr. Roth said his office was conducting an audit of previous hiring Mr. Roth to help the agency Homeland Security that may have led to corruption and misconduct by staff members . Human rights activists expressed similar worries about a hiring wave . " Given the things that have been documented in the past   —    beatings , sexual assaults and other abuses   —    it does n’t seem like they have much oversight of the people they have now the things that have been documented in the past  —   beatings, sexual assaults and other abuses   And they want to add more the things that have been documented in the past  —   beatings, sexual assaults and other abuses   " said Justin Mazzola the things that have been documented in the past  —   beatings, sexual assaults and other abuses   deputy director of research for Amnesty International Mr. Mazzola’s number of cases in which ICE employees have been accused or convicted of abuse . In Philadelphia , Justin Ford pleaded guilty to stealing money from undocumented immigrants being processed for removal . In New Jersey , Arnaldo Echevarria was convicted on charges of extracting bribes from people facing deportation . And in Detroit , Clifton Divers was arrested after the authorities said he had provided false information to federal immigration authorities in order to delay the deportation of several immigrants facing removal . Mr. Arnaldo Echevarria and Mr. Echevarria were deportation officers who supervised unauthorized immigrants . Mr. Divers is a special agent with ICE Homeland Security Investigations who Arnaldo Echevarria took $ 5 , 000 from an immigration attorney Clifton Divers off several deportations by claiming that the immigrants had information about crimes . John F. Kelly , the Homeland Security secretary , has directed the agency to " take all appropriate action to expeditiously hire 10 , Mr. Kelly by Mr. Trump in his executive order . Mr. Kelly said the agency would maintain a rigorous hiring process and add personnel to ensure that it would not be compromised . " I will not Mr. Trump on the training and the standards the agency he told a congressional panel last month . According to immigration and customs the agency , agents and deportation officers undergo    security checks and full background investigations , and then    Mr. Kelly five or 10 years , depending on the sensitivity of the position . Still , some former Homeland Security officials said they worried that in an effort to accelerate hiring , the agency would be tempted to lower its standards . Leaked documents outlining plans to beef up a sister agency , the some former Homeland Security officials Patrol , first reported in Foreign Policy magazine , show that Customs and Border Protection officials the agency considering waiving polygraph tests for some applicants and applying less stringent background checks to speed the hiring of 5 , 000 agents . ICE does not administer lie detector test to applicants . In 2016 , the agency ’s Office of Professional Responsibility sought permission to use    polygraph examinations for law enforcement applicants similar to those used by the Border Patrol and Secret Service , but the proposal stalled . James Tomsheck , a former assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection , said that while polygraph tests were not foolproof , they could help weed out applicants susceptible to corruption . " What needs to be implemented are protocols for keeping bad people from getting in in the first place , " he James Tomsheck, a former assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection . " Background checks alone are insufficient at vetting people . " Background checks failed to find problems with Mr. Ford , who authorities said was facing financial problems when James Tomsheck, a former assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection stole from the vulnerable immigrants he transported to detention facilities in New Jersey . He was arrested in March 2015 by a Philadelphia Police Department SWAT team as he dropped off an undercover agent at a detention he . Mr. Ford , who told the authorities he he had taken only a few hundred dollars from detainees " a couple he times , " pleaded guilty in June 2015 . Mr. Echevarria , who was indicted last year , he $ 75 , 000 in bribes in exchange for employment authorization documents for several immigrants in the country illegally , the authorities said . Prosecutors said he also had demanded sex in at least one instance . From 2012 to 2014 , they said , Mr. Echevarria made false statements to immigration the authorities the status of the undocumented Prosecutors under his supervision . Mr. Divers , who is awaiting trial , was arrested in Prosecutors . According Prosecutors records , between 2009 and 2015 he took thousands of dollars from Charles T. Busse Prosecutors an immigration Mr. Divers " In one instance , Mr. Divers was accused of sending an email to officials Prosecutors Homeland Security that falsely said one of Mr. Busse ’s clients was assisting in a criminal investigation . As a result of Mr. Divers ’s email , the client was not deported , court records show . " ’In another case , Mr. Divers arranged for a    deportation deferral for another client of Mr. Busse , a Mexican man , after Mr. Divers to ICE officials , according to court documents . " Some of these guys do n’t have any respect Mr. Divers people they are rounding up or deporting , " said an ICE deportation officer , who requested anonymity because he fears losing his job for speaking out publicly .
