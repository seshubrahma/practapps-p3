The last election I covered did n’t work out so well for me . The last election I covered was May 2013 , and I was in Pakistan . As I was returning from a polling station in the southern city of Lahore , military intelligence officials flagged down my car . Hours later I was on a plane out of Pakistan , having been deported . Elections are a fraught business in many parts of the world . In many of those countries , the American way of choosing a president seems ideal , however imperfect . The electoral machine resembles a classic ,    limousine : large , showy and expensive , yet robust and broadly predictable . This year ’s race , at the outset , looked set to follow in that vein as a contest between the scions of two storied political dynasties , Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush . Then the upstart billionaire and reality TV star Donald J. Trump thrust himself the upstart billionaire and reality TV star Donald J. Trump the fray , shredding the script , dismissing Mr. Jeb Bush upending most notions of what is possible , or acceptable , in an American political contest . I have come from my regular base in Cairo to the United States to help with The New York Times ’s coverage of the 2016 campaign . You might wonder what I can add , given that I ’m Irish and my American colleagues are already producing a stream of illuminating and incisive stories . I hope to supplement that coverage The New York Times’s coverage of the 2016 campaign that responds to the queries of our international readers , and approaches the election   —    in all its drama , the election   and absurdity   —    in much the same way as we would events abroad . The series will be called Abroad in America . This feverish political season has transfixed the world outside America , too America The election ’s the election     —    the primary contests , when the two main parties select their ultimate candidates   the two main parties    attracts an unusual degree of international scrutiny . Violence at rallies , incendiary speeches , race baiting , attacks on journalists and judges , proposals to bar Muslims or Mexicans   —    the primaries signaled a sudden sea change that left    watching with fascination , puzzlement and a profound sense of trepidation . For some countries , the changes resonate strongly at home . Mr. Trump ’s success chimes with nationalist surges across Europe and the " Brexit " vote . Disillusionment with traditional elites , hostility toward immigrants and anger among the losers from globalization   —    all resonate elsewhere . Yet it is odd and disturbing to hear terms like fascism and demagogy , most frequently associated with the European fringe or rickety    governments , being used in the context of an American campaign . Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign is haunted by the high levels of hostility even among many voters on the left . And so the election , which starts in earnest in the coming weeks , is shaping up as a close unpopularity contest : In the latest polls , Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton both have 40 percent support . But it is not just about the winner in November . The process has thrown up urgent new questions   —    about race , guns and the global economy , among others   —    as well as anguished soul searching about the very process of selecting a president . Where will the politics of resentment and anger ultimately lead ? Does the United States suffer , as one writer suggested , from too much democracy ? Could this be an "   event " for representative government ? My reporting will focus more at ground level . Some of my efforts will be explanatory   —    unraveling the intricacies and curiosities like the Electoral College , a source of befuddlement to many foreigners ( and some Americans ) . More broadly , though , I hope to turn my focus as a foreign correspondent to deciphering the fears , hopes and motivations that are driving voters of every hue , and will determine the most powerful leader on the planet . My journey will also be driven by you , the readers . I ’ll be posting on Twitter and Instagram , and soliciting your questions and concerns . What infuriates , intrigues or mystifies you about the elections ? I ’ll be starting the journey on Monday at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland . Please join me on the way .
