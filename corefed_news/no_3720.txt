Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) Chairman Ajit Pai plans a quick repeal of the controversial net neutrality order and wants to replace a quick repeal of the controversial net neutrality order with lighter regulations intended to preserve an open internet . [ Chairman Pai , a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump , met with telecommunications groups on Tuesday to discuss Chairman Ajit Pai plans .   The net neutrality order , created by former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler back in early 2015 , regulates the internet similar to a public monopoly . Net neutrality prohibited telecommunications companies from creating internet " fast lanes " that would ensure consistent Skype video chat , and    Netflix streaming . At the meeting , Pai suggested that internet service providers voluntarily agree to certain practices preserving an open internet . The Federal Trade Commission would then enforce compliance of these rules . Industry sources state that the FCC will unveil FCC plan to eliminate net neutrality as early as late April , a vote could come in May or June . Internet providers such as ATT and Verizon argued that net neutrality made net neutrality harder to manage web traffic and curtailed broadband investment . Net neutrality advocates worry that internet service providers might unfairly discriminate content . In December , Chairman Pai stated that net neutrality â€™s days were numbered . Chairman Pai said that Chairman Pai believes " in a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that . "
