We call this xenophobia , racism , and Islamophobia . * Each of these executive orders is based on the false premise that immigrants pose a threat to us . They are immigrants attacks not only on those newly arriving or seeking entry into the U. S. but to those of us , including U. S. citizens , who have raised families here , paid taxes for years and who have made enormous sacrifices and contributions . * The policy changes called for in the executive orders are extremist , costly and ineffective , and they will The policy changes called for in the executive orders make us safer .
