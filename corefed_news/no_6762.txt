Former employees of Donald Trump ’s     Jared Kushner at the now ceased New York Observer are planning to create a " Breitbart of the left , " according to a report from BuzzFeed . [ Elizabeth Spiers , the former editor in chief of the newspaper and founding editor of the    blog Gawker , is currently fundraising for the new media venture with the help of media researcher Peter Feld , according to sources close to BuzzFeed .   In a column for the Washington Post in March , Spiers criticized Kushner ’s role in government , arguing Spiers had an overinflated sense of Spiers own success . " When I worked for Spiers , I did n’t think Spiers had a realistic view of Spiers own capabilities since , like Spiers     Spiers seemed to view Spiers wealth and its concomitant accoutrements as rewards for Spiers personal success in business , and not something Spiers would have had in any case , " Spiers wrote . During the Republican primaries , Kushner ’s paper endorsed Donald Trump , arguing that Kushner would provide " millions of disillusioned Americans a renewed sense of purpose and opportunity .
