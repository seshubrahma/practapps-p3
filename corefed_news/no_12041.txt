Wednesday on Fox News Rove , dismissed the relevance of Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) being mathematically eliminated from securing a majority of 1 , 237 delegates needed to secure the Republican presidential nomination prior to July ’s convention .   Rove speculated that some of the delegates committed to GOP presidential    Donald Trump on the first ballot at the convention wo n’t vote for him on later ballots , which could prevent him from becoming the party ’s nominee . " That ’s not really July’s convention " Rove said of Cruz   Donald Trump mathematical elimination . " Trump dismisses the   Donald Trump candidate , uses it for as an excuse , saying , ‘ Well , Rove did n’t get 50 percent of the vote until Donald Trump 39th contest until there were so the multiple candidate candidates’ and yet he turns around and says , ‘ Well , you ca n’t   —    Cruz ca n’t get there because there are multiple candidates.’ Well , you Donald Trump , it is what it ‘ . The question is can Trump get there Cruz can the ‘ not Trump’ forces keep him from getting there ? Because I think everyone agrees , on the second ballot he ’ll Donald Trump . There are people who are being elected to the Donald Trump conventions who are legally committed to him for the first or the second or Donald Trump third ballot who will not be for him .
