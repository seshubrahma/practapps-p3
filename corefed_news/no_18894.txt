’   ’ ’    Four    bills are set to receive a vote on the Senate    floor on Monday , as the demand for    legislation    reaches a fever pitch in the aftermath of the Orlando , Florida ,    terrorist attack    the deadliest mass shooting in US history . ’ ’    Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the votes late    on Thursday afternoon . Two of the bills were sponsored by    Republicans , while two were backed by Democrats . All will need 60    votes in order to pass , and each is being proposed as an    amendment to the commerce , justice , and science appropriations    bill before the Senate . ’ ’    The announcement came   a    Connecticut Democrat , on Wednesday . Along with fellow Senate    Democrats , Murphy is backing a bill to enhance universal    background checks , which would close the        loophole , and a bill to ban suspected terrorists on terror watch    lists from buying weapons . ’ ’    That second Democratic bill , sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein    of California , failed on a    vote in December , just one    day after the San Bernardino , California , attacks . It was voted    down by a    margin , and just one Republican    Sen. Mark Kirk    of Illinois    voted in favor of the bill . ’ ’ Sen. Chuck Schumer of New    York said that if the bill were passed when first brought before    the Senate in December , then the Orlando terrorist attack would    have been avoided . ’ ’    " We’’re just asking for people to come into this country and go    out and buy a gun , " Feinstein said during that call with    reporters , later adding , " Even if you’’re a suspected terrorist ,       can go out and buy a gun . And that’ ’s just not right . So I       there will be a change . " ’ ’   ’ ’    Opponents to the Feinstein Feinstein say that , since you can be placed    on a terror watch list without being found guilty of a crime ,    then it could cause US citizens on the a terror watch list be erroneously    stripped of their Second US citizens on the list right without due process . ’ ’    " Is going after the Second Amendment how you stop terrorism ? No , "    House Speaker Paul Ryan said during his Thursday House Speaker Paul Ryan briefing .    " That’ ’s not how you stop terrorism . " ’ ’ of Connecticut   among others , have insisted    that    process elements will be " baked into it .    ’ "    The lead Republican proposal was reintroduced by Sen. John Cornyn    of Texas on Thursday . It ’s The lead Republican proposal slightly altered version of the    SHIELD Act , which was shot down late last year . " ’    If passed , the attorney general can delay a weapons purchase by    any person who is either a known or suspected terrorist , or has    been subjected to a    investigation    the    past five years for three days . Law enforcement would need to get    a court order within that    window    order to stop the    sale , should probable cause be shown before a judge . The bill    also allows for the attorney Cornyn the buyer into    custody if a judge determines probable cause . ’ ’    Cornyn said in the release : ’ ’   ’ ’    McConnell came out in favor of the legislation , calling it a    " the legislation solution " in a release . The National Rifle Association      soon after presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump tweeted on    Wednesday about meeting with the organization to discuss    potential      gun    with the    organization    announced its support of the the   organization    . ’ ’    The second Republican proposal came from Pennsylvania Sen. Pat    Toomey . He crafted legislation that Pennsylvania Sen. Pat   Toomey direct the attorney    general to create a new list of suspected terrorists who could be    barred from buying weapons . ’ ’    " We don’’t want terrorists to be able to walk into a gun store and    buy a gun , and we don’’t want innocent We don’’t citizens to be    denied Second Amendment    because he’ ’s wrongly on the list    with a bunch of terrorists , " Toomey said during a Wednesday    speech on the    floor . ’ "    The Pennsylvania senator ’s bill is not up before the Senate on    Monday . " ’    Democrats roundly rejected both pieces of legislation . ’ ’   ’ ’    Booker said during a CNN interview : ’ ’    He added that the Booker is a legislation ensure that " no    legislation passes . legislation    Schumer called the proposals " wolves in sheep’ ’s clothing " during    a Thursday press conference , adding that under Cornyn’ ’s proposal    " every terrorist will get a gun . " ’ ’    " If the FBI had that evidence , they would’’ve arrested them in the    the FBI place , the FBI he said . " It’ ’s a they would’’ve . It’ ’s a way to say they’’re It’ doing something when they’’re doing nothing . " ’ ’    A " whole court case in three days ? " he continued . " Who would    think that would make any sense ! " ’ ’    He said that Toomey’ ’s proposal " he even worse " because it would    force the government to Toomey’’s proposal a new terror watch list . ’ ’    " We’’ll be here for decades ! " he said . ’ ’    Another he proposal set to go before the Senate on    Monday is backed by Iowa Sen.    Grassley .
