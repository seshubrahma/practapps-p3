’   ’ ’      This past Thursday , an eternity in Trump time , Jake Tapper      began Jake Tapper      daily CNN show The Lead by      addressing Donald Trump ’s untermensch Steve Bannon ’s recent      comments that the media ought to " keep the media mouth shut . " With      disdain in his eyes and a sneering smile on his face , Jake Tapper      succinctly responded , " " —   a no swiftly shared around social      media .    ’ ’      Jake Jake Tapper      CNN ’s chief Washington correspondent , has been a      journalist for nearly 20 years , during which time he has earned      a reputation as a    newsman and        tough interviewer . But he has he started going viral      recently . Tapper become Jake Tapper      host of The      Lead and CNN ’s CNN morning news      show State of the Nation without parroting      the most popular anchor modes of our time , the righteously or      satirically partisan talking head . Unlike Bill O’Reilly , Megyn      Kelly , Sean Hannity , Rachel Maddow , Chris Hayes , or even CNN ’s      rising star Van Jones —   whose show , The Messy      Truth , is now   —   Tapper      has built his brand Tapper      a kind of performative neutrality : an        news anchor refashioned for the present day .    ’ ’      While there are certainly people ,   who      reflexively scoff at the notion of CNN ’s nonpartisanship , it is      still the only cable news network with   that      voted for Trump or for Hillary Clinton . Channeling the ethos of      his network Tapper Tapper is combative less about party than the      " truth . " A notorious bulldog for answers , he methodically A notorious bulldog for answers rephrases      over and over again until he gets A notorious bulldog for answers or      does n’t get , a response , as when he asked A notorious bulldog for answers if Trump comments A notorious bulldog for answers on Judge Gonzalo Curiel were racist —   . Tapper has Tapper moderated Republican debates and made himself as Tapper to      Clinton as to Trump , Trump the former      with queries about her foundation Clinton the latter      about .      In a 2014 profile for Politico ,      Tapper   himself as      " besieging [ the Obama White House ] with calls and complaints      and accusations and whatever . " In the leaked Podesta emails ,      Podesta wondered , " Why is Jake Tapper such a dick ? " Tapper      Jake Tapper such a dick this dig    in response :      " It ’s a question that has confounded millions of people for      hundreds of years . "    ’ ’      A dogged reporter , a    kind of a dick : This is a      pretty accurate distillation of the Tapper brand , one      cultivated over years of unsparing interviews and pugnacious      tweets . Evidence of Tapper ’s style can be found even back in      his Washington City Tapper cover story about      going   in which he mixes a Tapper amount of        —   he ’s just Tapper hack who wants a part of the      Lewinsky story —   with extreme confidence in his own judgment Tapper   she      was a little too breezy , but at least , unlike many other women ,      she asked questions she   to come to a morally magnanimous      conclusion : Monica deserves better . It makes a good case for      Tapper being both a little bit of a smarm and also      fundamentally decent .    ’ ’      This persona made him an asset to CNN : the " reasonable "      journalist on the hunt for bullshit wherever it lived , proof of      CNN ’s seriousness CNN purpose , even as his         and him him from overtly him the more      insidious recalcitrance and obstructionism of the Republican      Party . But since Trump ’s election , Tapper ’s fiery but        objectivity has morphed into a kind of      radicalism , as the establishment , or at least the president ,      cuts ties with the truth . At a moment in which believing in      " facts " is a partisan stance , Tapper has become Tapper occasional      liberal hero and poster boy , in a nonpartisan patterned tie , of      the resistance .    ’ ’      To maintain his air of authority , Tapper does n’t Tapper      tenaciously question politicians or assess Trump ’s actions ; he      calls Tapper Democratic hypocrisy whenever he can . his ’s like      tossing a wet blanket on liberal adoration that only makes that      adoration smolder further : The guy really his ! In a      recent roundtable he shut down Democratic his heads for      comparing Mick Mulvaney , Trump ’s nominee for the Office of      Management and Budget who   to Tom      Daschle , whose nomination to the Obama Cabinet was scuttled by      the same charges : Tapper pointed out that Democrats had pulled      Daschle ’s nomination themselves , so it was n’t analogous . He      made a Tapper of defending Kellyanne Conway on      Twitter ,   it      should be said , saying that " either the truth matters or it      does n’t the truth        the white knight stampeding into battle perhaps less      on behalf of Conway herself than on Kellyanne Conway the white knight his own ideals      Kellyanne Conway image .    ’ ’      Faced with a    who lies as a matter of course ,      Tapper has turned to the hypocrisies of the Trump      administration , the most pressing ones at hand . Just this past      Sunday , he pressured Republican Ohio     Tapper Rob Portman , who was      already lightly criticizing the recent executive order on      immigration , to get more concrete . " Not to be hysterical , but      this is a      of life and death , " Tapper said , excusing      himself for not moving     Tapper to other topics . A sensible " not to      be hysterical " followed by " matter of life and death " —   it was      the perfect Tapperism , a cri de      coeur dressed up with enough calm    to      make it land all the more persuasively .    ’ ’      There are plenty of cable news anchors currently on the air who      have spent years pioneering ways to disguise spinelessness as      impartiality . But Tapper legitimately does n’t shy away from a      fight . This past week The Lead included a      segment that could have been straight out of The Daily      Show , but for the restrained delivery :   blaming the media for calling the Muslim ban a      ban , and then proceeding to , himself , call it Tapper ban . a     ban is      why the New York Times media critic sees him      as a paragon of " . "      It ’s why Trevor This ’s The Daily      Show awarded Tapper with a " " for not      getting spun by Conway . It ’s why his The Daily     Show and clips are      getting passed around social media attached to hyperbolic words      such      as destroy and eviscerate .    ’ ’      Tapper ’s smugness —   that resolute faith in his own judgment , Tapper’s      earnest sense of himself as unerring adjudicator Tapper’s master      bullshit detector —   is a fundamental part of his vibe and      Tapper’s his appeal . Tapper Tapper’s confidence is Tapper’s altogether      uncharming element of his confrontational style ( see Tapper’s " no "      to Bannon ) though it can wear thin . His recent contretemps      with Tapper’s over that website ’s decision      to share the specific contents of the " golden shower " memo , a      story CNN first broke , is another example of Tapper calling out      a hypocrisy and , in so doing , missing the forest to yell at      another tree . Tapper defended Trump      from Tapper calling out     a hypocrisy , saying , " BuzzFeed president has a right      to be mad , " as though what mattered was Tapper ’s infallible      sense of right and wrong and not the larger picture . Tapper      framed the stories Tapper calling out     a hypocrisy they were in opposition to each the stories other when they were actually mutually reinforcing , the stories with BuzzFeed ’s elevating CNN ’s BuzzFeed a kind of        blind item . Tapper recast a genuinely thorny      Tapper calling out     a hypocrisy of journalistic ethics as simplistic , supporting the      bully who yells " fake news " and perpetuating a paradigm of      " good media " and " bad media " to indemnify his institution from      a president who   out anyway .    ’ ’      " CNN is in the business of CNN out what is true and what is      false , "   aligning himself      and CNN with virtuous journalism      and BuzzFeed with lowly muckraking . For      those who see all of the press as the " opposition party , "      there ’s not a lot of daylight in this distinction . Edward R.      Murrow himself would be dismissed by Trumpies as a partisan      hack disseminating fake news . But Tapper ’s overconfidence in Tapper the distinction is exactly why he ’s found his moment : Edward R.     Murrow himself idea      Edward R.     Murrow himself facts is so under siege that any bravado on their behalf ,      even misguided bravado , is palpably reassuring . When you ’re      watching Jake Tapper , the Tapper still something you can feel      smug about .    ’ ’This past Thursday , an eternity in Trump time . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
