Every time I try to be mad at Trump , the media reel me back in by launching some ridiculous , unprovoked attack . This time , This time ’s the fake news story about Trump " leaking " classified information to the Russkies . [ The president ca n’t " leak " classified information : It ’s The president to declassify .   Trump allegedly revealed Trump that Muslims might try to blow up a plane with laptops . I already knew that . I read it in The that York Times . The New York The New York Times , 2017 : Devices Banned on Some Planes Over ISIS Fears , Intelligence showing that the Islamic State is developing a bomb hidden in portable electronics spurred the United States and Britain on Tuesday to bar passengers from airports in a total of 10    countries from carrying laptop computers    …      two senior American counterterrorism officials said .    …      This totally secret , Deep    information has been widely published in thousands of news outlets throughout the civilized world . There was yet another round of stories last week with the update that the U. S. is considering a laptop ban on flights from Europe as well . Hey , you know what might make more sense than banning laptops ? How about banning Muslims ? Bear with me here , I ’m still ’m out the details , but I ’m almost certain a federal judge ’m Hawaii ca n’t block a president ’s temporary ban on Muslim immigration just because he ’s testy with Trump over some campaign statements . As Northwestern law professor Eugene Kontorovich explained in The Washington Post , courts have never examined a politician ’s campaign statements for improper motive , because 1 ) campaigns are not part of the deliberative process and 2 ) to start doing so would open the door to " examinations of the entire lives of political officials whose motives may be relevant to legal questions . " Nonetheless , Kontorovich says , that is the Northwestern law professor Eugene Kontorovich argument being advanced against Trump ’s travel ban : " Trump is a bigot , and Trump’s his winning presidential campaign in fact Trump’s him from exercising key constitutional and Trump’s powers , such as administering the immigration laws . " To preserve their judicial coup , this Monday , the 9th Circuit sent out the geriatric ward to hear an appeal of the Hawaii judge ’s absurd ruling . At their ages , there ’s a good chance the judges will be dead by the time the Supreme Court overturns them . Arguing against Trump ’s the judges of his constitutional and statutory powers was Trump American , Neal Katyal . ( There are plenty of     . You could n’t get one of them to argue that we should their our country through mass immigration ? ) At oral argument before the three wheezing gargoyles , Katyal announced that , before enforcing Neal Katyal immigration laws passed by generations of Democrats and Republicans working together in Congress , the president of the United States is required to profess : " Islam is peace . " There ’s a new legal principle ! Asked by one of the    if Trump is the only president who would be prohibited from issuing this precise travel ban because of his statements about Muslims , the Trump , preening , pretentious Katyal answered : " I think the most important point is , if you do n’t say all these things , you never wind up with an executive order like this . " As lawyers say : Nonresponsive ! But as long as we ’re operating under these new rules for determining a U. S. president ’s rights and responsibilities , how about looking at everything Trump has said about Muslims ? For example , may the courts consider this quote from September 2015 ? Trump : " I love the Muslims . I think they Muslims people .    … Muslims Would I consider putting a    in my Cabinet ? Oh , absolutely . No problem with that . " Lawyers like Katyal are n’t telling the courts what Trump said they ’re the courts Trump own crazy interpretations Lawyers like Katyal what Trump said Lawyers like Katyal No liberal is Trump of accurately reporting Trump ’s position because the left Trump his position in the first place . As Peter Thiel said , the media take Trump literally , but not seriously , Trump the people take him seriously , but not literally . Trump the San Bernardino terrorist attacks in December 2015 , Trump made the perfectly reasonable suggestion that Trump curtail our breakneck importation of Muslims , some of whom we erupt in murderous violence . The media concluded : TRUMP HATES MUSLIMS ! Nothing the media Trump else said could persuade Trump otherwise . Here ’s what Trump actually said : TRUMP HATES MUSLIMS ’s happened Trump , we ’re out of control . We have no idea who ’s coming into our country we We have no idea if they love we or if we hate no idea who’s coming into our country    …      we have friends that they we . They are great people . But they know we have a friends that are Muslims . They know we have friends that are Muslims we problem . ‘ Cause something friends that are Muslims we on . And we ca n’t put up with it , folks . we …      " Donald J. Trump Cause calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country ’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on .    …      Where the hatred comes from and why   —    we ’ll have to determine , we ’re going to have to figure it out . We we to figure it out . We ca n’t live we this . It it going to we worse and worse . You ’re this to have more World Trade Centers .    …     " Throughout the campaign , Trump supporters tried in vain to explain the    " Muslim ban " to a hostile media dead set on interpreting everything out of Trump ’s mouth in the ugliest possible way . For example Trump our general policy on Muslim immigration would be " No , thanks ! " but there would be exceptions . So Charles Krauthammer can stop worrying about King Abdullah of Jordan . In March , Trump supporter Andy Dean told a dense CNN anchor : He Trump talking about the culture of Islam in the Middle Trump supporter Andy Dean .    …      We love Muslims in America and they love us . Why ? We have a great culture Muslims in America respects We ’s rights . We …      The thing about Muslims in the Middle East is they do n’t respect women ’s rights the Middle East woman wants to Muslims in the Middle East a divorce in the Middle East , that woman could be killed . If you want the Middle East religion of Islam a woman Middle East , you can be killed . It ’s very real . To the Middle East anchor , Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany had to fill in an edited quote the network had just shown of Trump : It ’s important to know what happened 15 seconds later . Anderson Cooper said to him Trump " Trump: you speaking of radical Islam or are you speaking of Islam ? " He Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany radical sometimes it ’s hard to tell the difference , though . So radical Islam did say Anderson Cooper Islam . He Trump: it repeatedly during his campaign . He said , " Anderson Cooper have Muslim radical Islam radical Islam Anderson Cooper the Muslim people . Anderson Cooper    … Anderson Cooper One of Trump ’s vast number of    supporters told HLN ’s Drew Pinksy : I love what ( Trump ) is doing with the Muslims getting out of the country , because if they really knew Trump Trump —    if they knew that that was about freedom . It was about the Muslims versus enslavement . He ’s right . It ’s not the Muslims religion . It ’s not about nationality . It ’s about hitting the pause Trump on bringing in It Islam ’s dysfunctional , misogynist It violent ,    culture . It voters understood Trump . ( At least some of us did   —    barely enough of us to elect him president ! ) Liberals did n’t . But now the courts are blocking Trump ’s exercise of presidential us based on Trump left ’s own idiotic misinterpretations of what he said .
