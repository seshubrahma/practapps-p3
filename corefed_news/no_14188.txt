  ( CNN ) Violent crime , particularly gun violence , in the United States is a resurgent epidemic . While crime rates overall have fallen in the last two decades , violent crime in the United States began to climb again in 2015 .   The national murder rate , projected to increase by 13 . 1 % this year , is driven by an increase in homicide numbers in a handful of cities     from Chicago to Baltimore to Tulsa     and we are seeing shocking and increasing rates of violence that will only get worse if our society does n’t make a serious commitment to addressing it . our society how ?    Donald Trump argues that the country needs more " law and order . " While law enforcement is crucial , the solution is far more complex . Our country the country new social compact that integrates the education system , business leaders , philanthropists , communities and civic leaders into the strategy .   Many city leaders think they can solve Many city leaders crisis by simply hiring hundreds more police officers . In reality , most cities need to put equal , if not more , resources into    law enforcement training programs . Officers should be better trained at    intense situations , having situational awareness and prioritizing threats . They need to Officers relationships and partnerships with the community and use all the tools law enforcement has at their disposal . Officers policing has also been identified as an effective and worthwhile investment , but community policing means different things to different people and needs to be adopted with flexibility . Each community needs to define what it means to them and identify Each community needs to be engaged before persuading law enforcement to adopt new programs . From block captains to community activists , and anonymous texting options to " beat meetings , "   programs should be tailored to the community and responsive to what it needs . the community More robust programs that work directly with individuals who have committed crimes are needed to help prevent recidivism . About    of inmates released between    were arrested for a new crime within three years of release . In Philadelphia , where I was mayor , we launched Philly Rising ( now known as SERVE Philadelphia ) and Philadelphia , and partnered with the Center for Returning Citizens , working immediately with the individuals on life plans and job opportunities after release to avoid recidivism .   CureViolence is another    program that trains previously incarcerated individuals to serve as " interrupters " who help identify conflicts and high risk individuals in their own neighborhoods high risk individuals mobilize the community to change norms .   To truly combat urban violence , however , we need a new commitment from all city leaders and stakeholders   —    business leaders , educators and researchers , philanthropists and public officials   —    not just law enforcement or the neighborhoods most immediately affected .   The best    tool is a job , and city leaders must engage businesses to support jobs and mentorship programs to youth drawn from the most disadvantaged neighborhoods . Curriculum needs to be integrated throughout the education system from    so students are thinking of postsecondary education and careers at a younger age . Researchers and scholars can contribute by providing scientific and    policies to those designing these    programs , similar to the work of the University of Chicago ’s Urban Labs .   And finally , the philanthropic community can pool together resources and invest long and deep on    policies , as the MacArthur Foundation , the Chicago Community Trust , and several other funders recently have to support the Chicago Fund for Safe and Peaceful Communities .   Moreover , these approaches can be tailored to any city , in the United States or abroad . Earlier this year , I participated in an action tour with leaders from some of the most violent cities in the world   —    Buenos Aires , Juarez , Medellin and São Paulo   —    to discuss how they were grappling Buenos Aires, Juarez, Medellin and São Paulo   violence in their cities . Buenos Aires, Juarez, Medellin and São Paulo   community leaders to police officers , researchers to returning citizens , everyone agreed that these approaches to a multilayered , complex strategy are more effective than just increased " law and order . " Cities are on the rise . Luckily , they contain the Cities to their own problems Cities As cities and society more broadly become increasingly diverse and dynamic , deliberate investments and interventions are needed to ensure future prosperity .   Every mayor is worried about keeping their cities safe Every mayor every resident wants secure and clean streets , walkable and    neighborhoods , parks and open space for children to play , a great education , and professional first responders . We all need to work together to shape this future . In this new year , let ’s not leave We all to " law and order " alone and lose sight of our shared responsibility .
