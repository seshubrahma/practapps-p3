  ( CNN ) When an " overheated and dehydrated " Hillary Clinton stumbled into a van as Hillary Clinton left a    memorial ceremony on Sunday morning , conspiracy theorists rejoiced .   A few hours later , after conspiracy theorists was revealed Hillary Clinton had come down with pneumonia     a common illness now being treated with antibiotics and a few days’ rest     conspiracy theorists got back to work , retrofitting baseless and lurid suggestions about Hillary Clinton health . The weekend wobble was treated by some political rivals and online antagonists as validation     proof positive that the Democratic nominee was unfit , in the most literal terms , for the presidency .   A shadow campaign pushing rumors that Clinton is hiding a grave illness to protect Clinton White House aspirations has existed for years , but only found a voice and    champions during the last few months of this general election contest .   Even as Clinton took a brief leave from the stump     Clinton is set to resume travel on Thursday     Clinton campaign wrestled with legitimate questions about a lack of transparency during the Sunday scare , the rumor mill churned apace .   Donald Trump , who has considerably been less open about his health , was mostly restrained in the aftermath     though his did couch his well wishes with some goading analysis , saying on Monday : " I just see what I see     the coughing fit was a week ago , so I assume that was pneumonia also . "   Or not . Facts have rarely gotten in the way of dubious suggestions about Clinton ’s health . In a letter released Wednesday , Clinton physician made a point of stating that the candidate " is in excellent mental condition . "   Here     quite apart from any legitimate concern stemming from Clinton recent illness     are a few of the more ludicrous and resilient theories : Whatever might be wrong , it ’s now being covered up by . .. a body double ! In the aftermath of the Sunday incident , web sleuths turned up a series of images web sleuths believe show the Clinton campaign used a " body double " to reassure the public and trick the press . Collected under the hashtag , # HillarysBodyDouble , photographs of the candidate before and after Clinton fell ill are being compared , as features like Clinton nose , ears and fingers are plotted     for examination and debate .   " Shocking claims are coming forward about a body double and who really emerged from ( daughter ) Chelsea ’s apartment [ on Sunday ] , " blared the right wing Madworldnews . com .   The writer goes on to ask : " Was it ( longtime Clinton impersonator ) Teresa Barnwell outside Chelsea ’s apartment yesterday , hired to salvage Hillary ’s campaign as Hillary’s campaign was imploding after the collapse ? " Teresa Barnwell responded to the suggestions     spreading across social media     that Teresa Barnwell had stood in for Clinton with a tweet of Teresa Barnwell own . " I ’m in Los Angeles today , " Teresa Barnwell wrote . " Not in NYC ! " Clinton is sick . .. because someone , perhaps a Russian agent , is poisoning Teresa Barnwell , Dr. Bennet Omalu , the forensic pathologist whose role in highlighting the aftereffects of head trauma on former NFL players was dramatized by Will Smith in a recent film , weighed in with Will Smith own theory on Sunday night .   " I must advice ( sic ) the Clinton campaign to perform toxicologic analysis of Ms. Clinton ’s blood , " Will Smith tweeted . " It is possible she is being poisoned . " Omalu is , on the face of Omalu , a more credible source and discerning eye , but , though a doctor , Omalu has not examined Clinton . Rather than expand on Omalu medical reasoning , Omalu followed up a little less than an hour later with a cryptic tweet : " I do not trust Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump . With those two all things are possible . " Though Putin ’s government has been implicated in the 2006 poisoning death of a former KGB operative in London , there is no evidence     and nothing in any of Clinton ’s medical notices , provided by Clinton physician     to suggest anything of the sort is at play here . Clinton has suffers from    ’dysphasia’   The bulk of the most prominent healther conspiracies center on Clinton’s December 2012 concussion , suffered after Clinton fainted while sick with a stomach virus .   Clinton Clinton’s caused Clinton to postpone planned testimony on the Benghazi attack , leading    skeptics to accuse the    of state of coming down with a " diplomatic illness "     or faking it . the   of state whispers died by the end of the month , when doctors discovered a blood clot in the vein behind Clinton right ear during a    exam . Clinton was treated with blood thinners and she testified Clinton Senate and House committees a few weeks later , on January 23 , 2013 . Multiple currently circulating theories attach themselves to Multiple currently circulating theories 2012 fall , including one pushed by Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson , who in August offered     that Clinton was Clinton from dysphasia , a neurological disorder that complicates speech and language comprehension due to brain trauma or disease . " What ’s new are the other reports of the observations of Hillary Clinton ’s behavior and mannerisms , " Pierson said during an appearance on MSNBC , after being asked why the campaign was indulging the rumors . " Specifically with what you just showed in those previous clips , as well as her dysphasia Hillary Clinton’s the fact that she ’s Hillary Clinton’s , she has Hillary Clinton’s a concussion . " Meanwhile , a Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel     who himself has noted that he is himself not a neurologist "     pushed a similar line .   " I saw the same video you saw , and I ’m wondering about a word called ’aphasia,’ where you ’re searching for words , you suddenly lose those words words that can be the sign , again , of some kind of traumatic brain injury or the    of a concussion , " he said himself    commentator Sean Hannity ’s show .   Brain damage , seizures , Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson ’s disease , The list of purported maladies goes on .   Karl Rove , the former top adviser to President George W. Bush , suggested in 2014 Clinton had been " wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury , " while assorted    sites and Twitter trolls have suggested she is prone Clinton seizures     a belief that sprung a new theory claiming a Secret Service agent ’s flashlight was really an " an    with Diazepam . "   Other have mused that she could be Clinton from Alzheimer ’s or Parkinson ’s disease . The conservative Powerline blog featured an anonymous letter on Sunday , from who it described as The conservative Powerline blog " prominent internist , " suggesting Clinton ’s pneumonia was related to Parkinson ’s : Parkinson " I raise this second possibility , " he wrote , Parkinson because of Hillary ’s history of neurological illnesses ( blood clot in brain , concussion ) hints raised on the internet in Wikileaks documents and by others that she may have Parkinson neurological disease like Parkinson ’s , and her by now Parkinson documented history of recurrent coughing fits . This second possibility is that she has an Parkinson pneumonia . " The first possibility , stated at the top , was that she simply had Parkinson the illness , like any other " healthy person living her usual life Parkinson " Others , if you feel like further plumbing the depths of ungrounded theories , include : Lupus , HIV and " imminent heart failure " event     only months away .
