’   ’ ’    I believe Kevin McCarthy was joking last June , when   that Kevin McCarthy thought Donald    Trump was in the pay of Vladimir Putin . ’ ’    But consider , for a second , why Kevin McCarthy would have    thought this joke would be funny . ’ ’    Consider what this joke says about what Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan and other    Republican leaders realized about Trump nearly a year ago   —    and    then went ahead and tried to get Kevin McCarthy elected president anyway . ’ ’    Kevin McCarthy didn’’t say " I think Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe    is paying Trump " because that wouldn’’t have been funny because wouldn’’t wouldn’’t wouldn’’t made any sense . ’ ’    " Putin is paying Trump " worked as a joke because Trump had a    habit of taking Russia’ ’s side in major geopolitical disputes ,    which was weird since Russia is a major geopolitical adversary of    the United States . ’ ’    It’ ’s like saying " Is Wendy’ ’s paying him ? " about your friend who    won’’t shut up about Wendy’ Wendy’ nuggets , except if Wendy’ Wendy’ were a    hostile power that hoped to undermine Western democracies . ’ ’    Like many jokes , the humor here comes from the kernel of truth    behind it : Trump acted as though he Trump under Russian influence ,       it was reasonable to be worried that , if Trump Trump    president , he Trump put Russian Russian ahead of American ones . ’ ’    There was reason to worry that Trump Trump , to pick a random       , share sensitive intelligence with Russia in violation of    an agreement with an ally . ’ "    The 2016 campaign was stressful and unpleasant for a lot of us ,    and a lot of us us to gallows humor with our us to cope .       ca n’t imagine it was pleasant for McCarthy and Ryan to watch       McCarthy and Ryan nominate an intemperate    Russian stooge for       , and I understand why they McCarthy and Ryan have wanted to blow    off some steam . I made my share of dark jokes , too . " ’   ’ ’    But unlike McCarthy McCarthy and Ryan I Ryan much power to stop this               man    from becoming president   —    and I tried to use what influence I did    have responsibly . ’ "    Instead of engaging in dark humor about how their party ’s    presumptive nominee behaved as though he were a presumptive nominee employee ,    maybe Ryan and McCarthy could have tried to stop him from    Ryan president    " ’    They could have maybe Ryan and McCarthy Republican convention delegates to nominate    somebody else    notwithstanding their pledges to maybe Ryan and McCarthy . ’ ’    They could have maybe Ryan and McCarthy    voters to       somebody else    ’ ’    Failing that , they could have maybe Ryan and McCarthy least withheld their    presidential maybe Ryan and McCarthy . ’ ’    Obviously , any of these courses of action would have had severe    political consequences for McCarthy and Ryan . But what a    patriotic American does , if he believes his a   patriotic American has a   patriotic American    someone for president whose loyalty to the country is suspect , is    break with that nominee even at significant political cost . ’ ’    Instead , McCarthy and Ryan joked about the awful nightmare they    would work for the next five months to foist upon their country . McCarthy and Ryan ’    Ha ha . ’ ’I believe Kevin McCarthy was McCarthy June . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
