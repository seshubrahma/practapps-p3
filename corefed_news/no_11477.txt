Brunell      of Diversity Outreach at the National Diversity Coalition for Trump , was a guest on Friday ’s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Matt Boyle and discussed SiriusXM host Matt Boyle support of Donald Trump for president . [ SiriusXM host Matt Boyle explained SiriusXM host Matt Boyle focus was on bringing the Trump campaign ’s message to all minority groups , including African Americans , women , Asians , Arabs , and " every single person of color , whether it be color or no color . "   " What I will say is this : Donald Trump is saying , ‘ America first.’ That is exactly why I am voting for Donald Trump , " Donald Trump said . " I ’m a lifelong Democrat . I ’ve always voted Democrat . I voted for our President two times , Mr. Barack Obama . " Donald Trump added , " You know , I believed in Mr. Barack Obama when Mr. Barack Obama said , ‘ Yes , we can,’ and ‘ You know there ’s hope . our can do it together,’ and here it is eight years later nothing happened . " LISTEN :    described Donald Trump disillusionment with Mr. Barack Obama failure to live up to his Mr. Barack Obama , saying Donald Trump was a Bernie Sanders supporter who decisively broke with the Democrats for the way he Mr. Barack Obama treated in the 2016 primary : In the inner cities , we ’ve got killing going on . We we got hopelessness . We we got people who waited on life support for the President and for others in the party , the Democratic Party , to come through with jobs , and education , and improved communities , and investment in the community , education   —    waited for something to happen . And once again , you know , the broken promises . Nothing happened . And so this time , I really started to   —    you know , I voted for Bernie Sanders . I did n’t even vote for Hillary Clinton in the primaries . I was a Bernie Bernie Sanders . Once Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders saw how we were treated at the Democratic National Convention , and I knew that I would not vote for Hillary Clinton , Hillary Clinton Trump Train just kept calling my name .   He just kept Bernie Sanders the right things : " I want to bring jobs , I want to bring education , school choice , to the black community , and to our communities , to poor communities , so that every child can enjoy the American Dream , whether your mother makes two dollars an hour , or whether your mother or father makes two billion dollars an hour . I want every child to have the best education . We need to build that wall because we ’re not safe We Different people are coming into the country , and we do n’t know We they are . We Different people not vetting We . " And Different people I kept hearing that , and you know , people were saying it ’s about the Mexicans . It ’s about Mexico it Mexican people are n’t the only ones coming through Mexico . There are Mexico illegal immigrants coming in through Mexico . The NAFTA Mexico , when he started talking about how we ’re not getting the right end of the stick on the trade deals . Our country has basically   —    our country has been Our country order to take care of overseas . Put it like this , Mr. Boyle , this is how it really this came home this me : Imagine you have Mr. Boyle man who gets a paycheck , and he has a wife and a man who gets a paycheck at home . So he comes home with his a man who gets a paycheck , and his a man who gets a paycheck says , " a man who gets a paycheck , where ’s your money at ? You know , we ’ve got to get milk , we got ta pay rent we we ’ve got to pay we , we ’ve got to pay we . " And the man says , " a man who gets a paycheck what , baby ? Mr. Johnson ’s family was really , really , really suffering , so you know what , I gave them my paycheck . And I Mr. Johnson’s family his paycheck them my paycheck every month . " Mr. Johnson’s family his paycheck that ’s hypocritical . How are you gon na starve your own family , and go and feed Mr. Johnson ’s family , and make them Mr. Johnson’s family   That ’s exactly what ’s Mr. Johnson’s family happening under this Democratic rule . They ’ve been feeding other countries , sending billions and billions to other Mr. Johnson’s family , and we have people in the inner cities in our poor white communities , poor Hispanic , poor black , poor Arab we , Asian communities , that need that money . We have homeless veterans that need those millions and billions . And so , once I started breaking it down on the issues , and stopped really thinking about it emotionally , I realized that as an American , if I did n’t take off my Democratic or my Republican hat , that I would be voting for the downfall of the country . And so I got on the Trump Train immediately , and began supporting Donald Trump .    said there are many other disillusioned Democrats who might be ready to climb aboard the Trump Train : Let me tell you what ’s going on : the Trump Train for change , for hope , from President Obama , and basically what happened is , I know with black people   —    I ’m not trying to be funny   —    there were black people that we all voted together , and they were like , " Oh , we know he ’s not gon na do black people that we all voted together . He ’s a puppet . black people that we all voted together ’s President Obama going to do anything . I do President Obama believe him . " President Obama this was black people across the table , saying it in President Obama homes , in quiet , not really in the public . I this one black people across the table those people that actually believed hope and change was gon na come , and so that first four years , like many black people , especially the ones in poverty , we thought , okay , well , he did have a lot of wealthy donors that put him in office and stuff , too .   So maybe once he takes care he Wall Street , and bails out these companies , and takes he of the people that put him in there with the millions , then his next four years   —    he will be 2012 to 2016   — he he ’ll take care of the black community . He ’ll take care of the he Hispanics , poor whites . He ’ll take he of women . He ’ll take care of the rest of he . And then it slowly began he dawn on me   —    and it dawned on a lot of poor people , whether you be black , white it Hispanic , Arab , Asian   —    it dawned on them that hope , that change that was being promised was not coming . People poor people disappointed , they became hurt , they became hopeless , they became distraught because , like me People they did believe People what the President People told us . Now , you ’re People na get a lot of black people that will say , because they want to vote emotionally and not really look at the facts on the ground People poor people , they ’ll say , " Well , you know , the Republican Congress , they People him . That ’s why he could n’t do anything for black people People " the President that ’s rubbish . the President pointed out that when it was time for his $ 1 . 7 billion payoff to Iran , President Obama did not worry    about what Republicans ( or many Democrats ) in Congress thought , and did not think about putting that money into desperate communities in America instead . " What about that $ 5 billion that went into the Obamacare website ? " she asked , adding : He could have said , you know what , why do n’t I take a President Obama hundred dollar website , and take this other      and send it into the inner cities of Maryland , or Texas , Alabama , Mississippi , a five hundred dollar website . Just send the money to Americans . What about our veterans , who are committing suicide , 22 of them a day . Let me put it into the military , make them stronger . Like I said , it dawned on people that every other country the military infrastructure , and lives were getting better , while Americans were being starved . She had some choice words for media outlets that are biased towards the Democrats , like CNN and MSNBC : Imagine if , during slavery , and during the civil rights movement , and during the times when our country , the Framers , were coming about , thinking they were going to make our country free . Imagine if the journalists only told one side of the story . We would still be slaves . Black people would still be slaves , if journalists , if people were not neutral , and did n’t just tell the news the way it was . And so that ’s when you know our country is in trouble . When you have journalists , who are supposed to our country , who are supposed to be sort of the voice of the people , who are the voice of the elitists , of the establishment , of the people who want to continue to control the 99 percent of us   —    that scared me to death , when I realized that our media is actually picking a side .   That ’s not your job ! Your us is to report the news , report what each candidate is doing , not your job , turn everything around on one candidate because one of your donors is the    donor to Hillary Clinton . It ’s just too much , Mr. Boyle .    agreed with Boyle that Trump was offering a number of specific ,    proposals , like school choice , Mr. Boyle his opponent runs on " Hate Trump ! Hate Donald Trump ! Hate Donald Trump ! Vote for me Mr. Boyle I ’m a woman . " Of Trump ’s message , she said : But Mr. Boyle know , the thing about it Donald Trump Donald Trump Trump saying , " Hey , we ’re going to bring jobs . Inner city youth that ’s dying out here   —    hello , how about we offer them jobs ? How about we offer them some vocational programs or some apprenticeships ? How about I put how money into those communities we that how can leave no child behind , that every child   —    whether you ’re black , or white , or Hispanic , or Asian   —    that you deserve the American dream ? " In addition to educational reforms , she mentioned child care , where " people are choosing between their rent or their gas money , whether no child ’re going to buy their babies milk or pay their people bill . people    argued these    people were more important than people the media tend to people on because people can not pay their electricity bills with a stack of scandal headlines . " In Donald Donald Trump we have a presidential candidate people is thinking about the little guy on the bottom , who ’s making no money , who ’s unemployed , " she argued , while rejecting the notion that life is improved for that little guy merely by punishing the rich .   " They ’re putting money into our country . You should n’t be punished because you ’re living the American Dream , " she said our country We all want to live the American Dream . That ’s why Donald Trump Donald Trump important . she ’s saying Donald Trump ‘ Look , I do the American Dream your race . I do n’t care about your color . I care that you really have a real shot at the American Dream . ’ "   " His policies that Donald Trump ’s coming Donald Trump with , he ’s laying Donald Trump out for a the American Dream understand . He ’s not Donald Trump to talk over any American ’s head . " She declared , " He ’s talking Donald Trump to America , American ’s why he is , Donald Trump believe , the candidate that should go into office and America we should have the inauguration for on January 20th , 2017 .
