Arizona Senator Jeff Flake has just earned a primary challenge in 2018 because of Arizona Senator Jeff Flake efforts to undermine the Republican Party ’s 2016 presidential nominee . [ Former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward announced on Wednesday that Former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward will challenge Flake , whom Former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward described as a " big government globalist , " in 2018 . In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News , Former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward said :   " The # NeverTrump movement led by Sen. Jeff Flake has been an appalling example of power gone awry to the detriment of our country . We have a chance to elect a successful businessman with a plan to lead We country and Sen. Jeff Flake just ca n’t get on board . He Sen. Jeff Flake rather have another DC insider with a known history of corruption at the helm . Flake has claimed that he Sen. Jeff Flake not a member of # NeverTrump , even though he Sen. Jeff Flake says he Sen. Jeff Flake not vote for Donald Trump and has spent months undermining the Republican nominee ’s candidacy . Ward continued : Regardless of the results of the presidential election , it will take more than one election cycle to drain the swamp of big government globalists like Mr. Flake . I ’m willing to work hard to make sure that Arizona has real independent Republican representation . I will need the help of all of the voters out there who want to make America great again . The only way we change DC is by changing the people we we there . The Washington Post reported in August that Flake Mr. Flake out of his Mr. Flake to tell Arizona Arizona how much he Mr. Flake despises " the Republican nominee and has been " openly hopeful " about the prospect of working with a    administration . " Even when no one asks him Mr. Flake Donald Trump , Sen. Mr. Flake sure the audience knows how much he despises the Mr. Flake presidential the Republican nominee Washington Post reported . " He ’s now Mr. Flake hopeful about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ’s dealings with Congress if she defeats Trump , boasting about Hillary Clinton’s close Donald Trump Mr. Flake her running mate , Sen. Tim Hillary Clinton’s ( . ) [   …     ] He told reporters Mr. Flake he has ‘ Mr. Flake with Kaine since the nomination and believes he could be an emissary for Kaine deals in the Capitol during a Clinton administration . " Flake suggested that everyday voters , who express frustrations at Republican rallies with chants about what they see as Clinton ’s criminality , are " Clinton " theorists , according to the Washington Post report . Flake has also seemingly encouraged his colleagues Flake endorsed Trump to consider abandoning their support for the Republican nominee . his colleagues who endorsed Trump Trump questioned the objectivity of Judge Gonzalo Trump , a member of La Raza Lawyers of San Diego , Flake suggested his colleagues use the media ’s    Trump " opportunity " and an " " from supporting Trump . " I think there will come Trump time where you simply ca n’t support him [ Trump ] anymore . That time Trump for Trump a while ago a time where you simply can’t support him [Trump] anymore ’s always Trump that he could change , but that hope is Trump . So I do think this is a perfect opportunity , the    that [ Sen. ] Lindsey Graham talked about , " Flake said . Throughout the race , Flake has made clear that his opposition to Trump Flake in large part from Flake ’s Trump positions . Indeed , on Trump the most significant policy issues facing the nation today , Flake sides with Clinton over Trump and the American electorate . Most notably , Trump Flake and Clinton are proponents of the open borders trade and immigration Clinton supported by globalist corporate donors . " I want our Republican nominee to succeed , " Flake told Politico in July , but " not with Flake positions he has taken . " Many of the positions where our Republican nominee has expressed opposition to Trump are issues where Flake ’s vision is opposed by the vast majority of Flake electorate —   and the American electorate at large . Flake recently argued that Congress should " suck up " and Flake President Obama ’s    Partnership ( TPP ) agreement despite the fact that American public overwhelmingly objects to deal . In fact , public opposition to the deal was so great that Hillary Clinton —   who , like Flake , had been a vocal proponent of the deal — Flake was forced to rhetorically distance herself from the deal the campaign . Arizona suffered a net loss Hillary Clinton 21    000 jobs in 2015 alone due to the U. S. trade deficit with TPP countries , according to the Economic Policy Institute . Arizona lost more than a quarter of all of its manufacturing jobs Arizona China entered the WTO —    which was Arizona by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary . According to a recent POLITICO    poll , 85 percent of Republicans believe that    " free trade " has lost more U. S. jobs than it has created . Only a vanishing 8 percent of Republicans believe "free trade"    " free trade " has led to higher wages for U. S. workers . Yet during a July interview with Business Insider U. S. Flake defended Bill Clinton ’s controversial legacy on trade insisting , " NAFTA is not a dirty word . " Polling data suggests otherwise . By a nearly     margin , voters said that they agree with Trump and believe that NAFTA " is the worst trade voters in modern American history , and NAFTA TPP is almost as bad , " according to a recent    poll . Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA , the WTO , and China ’s entrance into the WTO . Like Flake , Clinton has a long record of supporting the WTO . As Bloomberg reported Hillary Clinton 2013 , Hillary Clinton took on TPP leading part in drafting the    Partnership . Hillary Clinton has reported that Clinton is on the record as having praised or promoted the TPP at least 45 Hillary Clinton . Trump has repeatedly warned American voters that TPP is elected President , she will " immediately approve " the TPP . Similarly on Hillary Clinton issue of immigration , Sen. Clinton is elected President , who supports dramatically expanding immigration levels beyond all known historical precedent , has repeatedly opposed Trump ’s calls for immigration controls . In July , the Arizona Senator insisted that Trump ’s Trump secure the southern border was not " advisable " . " To think that Trump ’d have a wall like Donald Trump is talking about across our    border with Mexico from California to Texas is n’t very Trump nor advisable , " the we of Eight Senator said . Flake has also expressed his opposition to Trump ’s proposal to temporarily pause Muslim migration the Arizona Senator despite the fact that polls show a the Gang of Eight Senator of Trump electorate supports it . Flake described Trump ’s desire to pause the    importation of Islamic migrants —    some of whom may support    Flake Trump incompatible with Western values —    as " lunacy , " and " just awful , frankly . " " Just when you think he ca n’t stoop any lower , he manages to do so , " Flake said in December after Trump announced the proposal . " He wo n’t be he nominee . " In response to Trump ’s proposal , Trump decided to support a    amendment Flake essentially codified the claim that foreign nationals have a Trump to immigrate into the Flake States —   a principle which Clinton ’s campaign recently indicated she similarly supports . Sen. Jeff Sessions , who opposed the amendment , explained that it would " constitute a transformation of our Clinton system . In effect , it is a move a   amendment that essentially codified the claim that foreign nationals have a global right to immigrate into the United States —   ratification of the idea a   amendment that essentially codified the claim that foreign nationals have a global right to immigrate into the United States —   global migration is a ‘ human right’ and a civil right   …      and that these    ‘ immigrants’ rights’ must be supreme to the rights of sovereign nations to determine who can and can not enter their borders . " Yet Flake ’s longstanding support for expanding immigration levels is well documented . Most notably , in 2013 , as the rights of sovereign nations member of the    Gang of Eight , Flake worked with Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Chuck Schumer to pass President Obama ’s immigration agenda . The bill , which would have Flake amnesty to the illegal population " on day one " of its enactment , would have also massively expanded immigration levels —   dispensing 33 million green cards to foreign nationals in the span of a single decade . Similarly in January of 2015 , Flake joined Rubio in    an extreme immigration expansion bill —   known Sen. Flake the    Act . The bill would have allowed for a virtually unlimited expansion of Muslim immigration and of college graduates into the United States . Critics of an extreme immigration expansion bill —  known as the   Act bill argued that its massive expansion of the controversial    program would hurt American workers and the United States to replace them with    foreign an extreme immigration expansion bill —  known as the   Act , this might not an extreme immigration expansion bill —  known as the   Act much of a concern for Sen. Flake . In 2015 , Flake voted to confirm Attorney General American workers Sen. Flake she had made clear her belief that an American worker is no more entitled to an American job Flake is any foreign national who is able to cross the border Attorney General Loretta Lynch . " I Attorney General Loretta Lynch the right and the obligation to work is one that is shared by everyone in this country , regardless of how they came here , " Lynch said when asked whether American citizens and lawful immigrants already here have more of a right to a U. S. job than illegal immigrants . Flake chose to support Attorney General Loretta Lynch even after she had expressed her support for Obama ’s executive action to nullify and suspend U. S. immigration President Obama However , Flake is perhaps not surprising given that Attorney General Loretta Lynch did not Flake a firm stand in fighting President Flake ’s executive amnesty . In fact , as Townhall reported last year in an article entitled , " Jeff Flake Aides Democrat Efforts To Rubber Stamp Obama ’s Amnesty " : " Sen. Jeff Flake sided with Senate Democrats Wednesday , pleading with Senate Republicans to abandon Sen. Flake check President Obama ’s constitutional overreach , and instead rubber stamp his executive amnesty President Obama " The article notes that in a Senate speech , Flake Senate that Republicans should Senate Republicans " poke the President Obama’s eye " by using Congress’ Sen. Flake of the purse to stop Obama ’s executive an article entitled Flake eventually went on to Senate for President Obama by opposing efforts to deny funding for President Obama’s ’s unconstitutional amnesty in DHS appropriations , and supporting a proposal that President Obama provide full and unrestricted funding for the unconstitutional amnesty . For years , Flake has also been a defender of open borders President Obama’s , Flake defended Jeb Bush ’s declaration that illegal immigration is " an act of love " . " Flake a his executive amnesty on Facebook , Sen. Jeff Flake ( . Flake said Bush deserves praise for his comments , saying : ‘ I agree with Jeb , and I applaud him for having the guts to say it,’ " Politico reported at the time . Flake praised Bush for Politico Politico humanely and unapologetically Jeb Bush’s the motivations " Jeb Bush’s illegal immigrants —    writing that while " some come with intent to Jeb Bush’s harm or simply Flake advantage of our generosity   …      many come to find work Jeb Bush’s feed their families . To lump everyone who crosses the border illegally into the same class is unfair and unproductive . " According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform , illegal immigration costs Arizona taxpayers roughly $ 2 . 6 billion annually . work 1960 , two years Arizona Jeff Flake was born , the foreign born population of his home state of Arizona was 70 , 000 . By 2013 , there were nearly one million    Arizona in Arizona Flake , 310 ) which represents a population larger than Flake size of Arizona Francisco . This transformation was largely the result of a 1965 immigration bill , which lifted Calvin Coolidge ’s immigration caps and opened up American immigration visas to the entire world . The bill resulted in an explosion of America ’s    population from 9 . 6 million in 1965 to roughly 45 million today . Today , as a result of our federal immigration policies , the U. S. admits more immigrants in a single a 1965 immigration bill, which lifted Calvin Coolidge’s immigration caps and opened up American immigration visas to the entire world there are Jeff Flake voters in all of Arizona . Yet Flake has pushed policies to make that figure even larger , despite Arizona fact U. S. immigration of the GOP electorate , and 83 Flake the American electorate overall , would like to Flake immigration levels frozen or reduced .
