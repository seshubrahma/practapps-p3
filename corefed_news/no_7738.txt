" Therefore , Whoopi Goldberg suggested a " deal " had been in place and terms of a "deal" should be investigated because they pose " an endangerment to the United States . "   Whoopi Goldberg said , " Let me end with this before we go to break , this this the first time a foreign power has been discussed in this fashion about our we . The fact that people do n’t seem to recognize that if there was a deal made , what is he expected to give them people this a deal made These are the questions that they ’ve These about every president . They asked These about Obama , who ’s he talking he , you know he ’s he bed with so and so , and everybody ran with that . " " But no one seems to want to run with the fact that somehow the Russians’ fingerprints are everywhere , " he continued he " So perhaps since he ’s he talking about everything is rigged , we should take a minute , we should we a minute and   —    I ’m trying to go faster —    take a minute and say , you know what , this is real , this is this .
