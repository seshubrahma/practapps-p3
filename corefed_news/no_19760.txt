The car inched forward through early morning traffic at LAX . Buses and trucks surrounded The car on all sides in a state of   . Transit vans pulled over to pick up travelers who wandered the arrivals area with Transit vans smartphones out , hands held up to block the sun , wheeled luggage clacking behind Transit vans . No one paid The car any attention —   until the driver swerved , accelerating onto the sidewalk in front of Terminal 7 . It No one over bags , flattened signage , and collided with pedestrians too slow to jump out of the way . In the few seconds anyone had to react —   to shout , to call 911 —   the the driver a homemade bomb hidden inside the trunk . The resulting explosion obliterated the front of the terminal , leading to a partial building collapse , and a catastrophic fire began to spread toward the gate area . The    The resulting explosion throughout the airport as black smoke , visible for miles , lifted in a pillar into the sky . Dozens were killed instantly . Suicide car bombs had come to LAX . This was exactly the nightmare scenario Anthony McGinty and Michelle Sosa had been hired to prevent . * * * Anthony McGinty , 54 , is a retired D. C. homicide detective now living in Pasadena . McGinty ’s tenure in Anthony McGinty nation ’s capital , where he attained the rank Anthony McGinty detective first grade , coincided with that city ’s darkest era , when it was known as that city’s murder capital of the United States . A Marine veteran who served in the second Gulf War and was stationed variously in Okinawa , Kosovo , Honduras , and the Mediterranean , McGinty is quiet , keeps his hair shorn close McGinty his scalp . He McGinty a slight McGinty to actor J. K. Simmons in the film Whiplash . While he was working the McGinty beat back east , McGinty also applied for McGinty received Top Secret clearance . This helped pave the way for him to become a McGinty between D. C. police command staff and the National    Center , where one of his responsibilities was to McGinty classified overseas intelligence reports detailing threats that might target the DC area . It was this experience that set the stage for his career ’s unexpected McGinty act at LAX . Michelle Sosa , 37 , graduated with a degree in international relations from Boston University in May 2001 . Trilingual in French , Spanish , and English , Sosa did not immediately know what sort of career to pursue . She often flew    from Boston to Los Angeles to visit her father who , She , still works for the airline industry . Then , four months after she graduated ,    She one of the planes , hijacked by ringleader Mohamed Atta , was on the same Boston to Los Angeles Boston Sosa Los Angeles flown so She times before . No longer confused about what to do with her degree in international She , Sosa was moved by the Sosa to apply for a federal intelligence job —   and , to her surprise , the She application process worked . Six months later , she disappeared into the She of U. S. intelligence , working as an analyst over the course of the next decade in both Florida and D. C. Her move out west She L. A. was not only professionally motivated : Sosa , a youthful , Sosa glamorous presence in a world of fluorescent lights and office cubicles , wanted to live near her family again , She ensure that her now     daughter She grow up in the company of her grandparents . Together She Sosa and McGinty , who Sosa both maintained Top Secret security clearance , were hired two years ago as part of a unique experiment in infrastructural protection and security at LAX . As McGinty describes it , their current operation falls somewhere between a    and a think tank . Together , the two of them have brought classified    their analysis to one of the world ’s busiest airports , augmenting traditional beat police operations with an investigatory agenda previously associated not just with a federal agency but with the power and reach of a   . Political and economic authority has always accumulated in sites of public infrastructure . Possibly the most significant civic figure in the history of Los Angeles , for example , was never elected to public office : William Mulholland , L. A. ’s early    water czar , fundamentally reorganized Southern California through a series of massive hydrological projects that continue to shape the region today . In his September 2016 cover story for The Atlantic , Stephen Brill suggested that infrastructure ’s outsize political influence today has only been amplified and accelerated by the country ’s ongoing reaction to the terrorist attacks of   . Under the moniker of "   protection , " sites of energy production , transportation logistics , waste disposal , and more have been transformed from    megaprojects on the literal edge of the metropolis into the heavily fortified , tactical crown jewels of the modern state . Bridges , tunnels , ports , dams , pipelines , and airfields now have geopolitical clout that rivals democratically elected civic institutions . Infrastructure is now conflict —   and cooperation —   by other means . Architect and Yale University urbanist Keller Easterling refers to this as the practice of extrastatecraft , or an emerging form of power , manipulation , and influence that exists outside the norms of what we currently consider representative government ( e. g. # bridgegate ) . It is soft power in a hard shell . To no small extent , then , Sosa and McGinty ’s initiative is LAX ’s attempt to reinvent itself as a player on Sosa and McGinty’s initiative international intelligence stage . Their work promises to propel Sosa and McGinty’s initiative city ’s aging airport to the forefront of today ’s conversations about what it means to protect critical infrastructure , and , in the process , to redefine where true power lies in the    metropolis . * * * The car bomb that decimated Terminal 7 shut down LAX for nearly a week and led to a nationwide terror alert . Flights around the world were affected and incoming planes had to be rerouted to other regional airports , causing    problems there . Cargo losses at LAX alone were estimated at LAX than $ 100 million a day . The projected death toll continued to rise , as victims succumbed to their injuries despite emergency care victims It was a sobering but —   thankfully —   entirely fictional scenario , part of an emergency tabletop exercise held in a conference room deep inside the Westin Los Angeles airport hotel . The meeting was what ’s known as an Aviation Security Contingency Plan Exercise , or AVSEC . It occurs once a year The meeting always with a different plot . There have been car bombs , hijackings , mass shootings —   an    catalog of speculative catastrophes , carefully studied and dissected for their training or tactical value . I pulled into the hotel parking lot early on the morning of Wednesday , November 9 . It was less than seven hours after real estate entrepreneur and former    star Donald J. Trump delivered his presidential victory speech , real estate entrepreneur and former   star Donald J. Trump an end to the 2016 U. S. election and the beginning of something altogether new in our nation ’s history . Workers in airport traffic control , Homeland Security , Fire Department , and police uniforms walked sleepily down the hotel corridors , as their colleagues from the FBI Workers in airport traffic control, Homeland Security, Fire Department, and police uniforms multiple international and domestic airlines , and nearby airport hotels stood sipping coffee in rumpled business attire . The idea of hiring McGinty and Sosa can be traced back to the administration of Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villagairosa . In November 2010 , Villagairosa assembled what ’s known Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villagairosa a Blue Ribbon Panel to assess the state of airport security in and around Los Angeles . There was Los Angeles —   and , as the panel confirmed , justified — a Blue Ribbon Panel that the region ’s airports were not prepared to respond to a terrorist threat of any nature , let alone to something on the scale of   . The group ’s final report was released the region’s airports later , in June 2011 , and it included 162 pages of specific recommendations for final report airport authority to implement as quickly as possible . After all , the    anniversary of    was approaching —   and no one knew if there might be another attack . One of the commission ’s key suggestions was that Los Angeles World Airports , or LAWA , the umbrella organization that controls not just LAX but a smaller regional airport over the Hollywood Hills in Van Nuys , " should consider creating the position of Director of Intelligence . " The person in this role " would proactively gather and share    intelligence , " and he or she would do so not only    the region ’s many airports , from LAX to Palm Springs , Van Nuys to San Diego , but also with federal —   even , if necessary , international —     agencies . To assist with this , the report suggested , the airport ’s future Director of Intelligence should also bring on board " a staff focused exclusively on gathering and analyzing intelligence regarding terrorist threats . " LAX would no longer be dependent on secondhand reports . Ethel McGuire , a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel , took this advice seriously . In the end , she hired not just one but two intelligence Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel for the job : Anthony McGinty and Michelle McGinty McGuire Michelle Sosa by the seeming complementarity of McGinty ’s Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel Sosa ’s respective McGinty . Michelle Sosa coming Sosa an intelligence background and Sosa had a contextual eye for    narratives McGinty , on the other hand , a McGinty street detective and Iraq War veteran , arrived at LAX with 25 years’ LAX of tactical insights and a deep knowledge of police culture under his belt . McGuire liked what she saw Sosa   so she rewrote some Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel lines and Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel them both . McGuire Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel came to LAWA , where she some budget lines now Assistant Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel after a full career at the Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel . She was , in fact the FBI of the very few female    Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel in the Bureau ’s history . Trailblazing runs in McGuire ’s family : Her daughter is also now an FBI Special Agent Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel them the only Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel ever to serve in the FBI simultaneously . McGuire is Trailblazing runs in McGuire’s family with elegantly the FBI and a helpful , even grandmotherly demeanor . In Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel the intelligence program she has helped to initiate , she is both precise and emotionally honest , unafraid of Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel the frustrations and fears that Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel dogged much of the program ’s creation . McGuire and I met in person at the AVSEC exercise , the intelligence program from discussions Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel bombs , radiation fears , and terminal fires . She was attracting a lot of attention , I could see . People involved at almost every level Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel the exercise were tracking her down , crossing the room for a quick handshake or respectful hello . McGuire and the AVSEC exercise Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel spoken at length about the intelligence program , as well as about the Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel McGinty and Sosa , but this gave us McGinty opportunity the intelligence program context of her peers . " We all have a common goal , " Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel said , referring to the maze of agencies connected Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel airport security , from Customs   Border Patrol to the DEA Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel " and that ’s to prevent anything from happening in Los Angeles . We work really hard to Los Angeles that we ’re covering each other —   through intelligence collection , dissemination , and sharing —   as quickly as possible . " The idea behind bringing Sosa We McGinty on board is still experimental , Sosa and McGinty’s " McGinty did n’t know exactly how this McGinty work , " she told me , " but I wanted to try it McGinty " After all , when she first got to LAWA in 2010 , finding good intelligence McGinty    threats was nearly impossible , she explained . " I this been asking the first couple McGinty years when I started here for intelligence reports for the airport , and there was n’t a whole lot out there , " McGuire said . " the airport was like , look : this was my former life . I know stuff happens at the airport ! We Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel got to be able to provide something more if you want to protect this the airport . " The challenge was not only a bureaucratic one , she said , although it was not exactly easy to find McGinty space for Sosa and McGinty to thrive in the already complex Sosa structure Sosa and McGinty’s Angeles McGinty culture . It was also physical —   The challenge challenge of the airport itself . " What was significant to me , even when I was at the FBI , " McGuire said the airport that the airport environment is a the FBI . " LAX is a city LAX a city . At more than five square miles , it is Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel slightly LAX than Beverly Hills . 50 , 000 badged employees report to work there each day , many with direct access to the airfield —   and thus to the vulnerable aircraft waiting upon it . More than 100 , 000 passenger vehicles use the airport ’s roads and parking lots every day , and , in 2015 alone , LAX hosted 75 million LAX in combined departures and the airport As McGuire knows all too well , LAX is also policed LAX a city . The airport has its own SWAT team and employs roughly 500 sworn police officers , double the number of Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel in the    city of Pasadena the airport than the the airport number of state police in all of Rhode Island . " Not only do you have the operational component , " McGuire said , " but you have all the policing —   and policing is so different from intelligence gathering . What I wanted to do was to really heighten or enhance the intelligence Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel . It is so impactful to how you police , why you police , where you police , and everything that you do in combating a terrorist threat . " For their work to have any real tactical value —   for their jobs to be worth it —   McGinty and Sosa would need to help assess a world that Sosa far McGinty of LAX . " This LAX global , " McGuire said . " We ’re an international their . We have about a hundred different countries flying here . If you stop traffic at LAX , it has LAX immediate LAX impact on aviation if Ethel McGuire, a member of the Blue Ribbon Panel shuts down , LAX immediately affects a LAX other countries . It has to We LAX    machine . " * * * On a cloudless ,    autumn day , I was picked up in an    Ford Interceptor driven by LAWA police officer Tia Moore . Sitting in back was Alicia Hernandez , our official escort for the day . Hernandez is a responsive and jovial veteran of the U. S. Army Reserves , where she spent eight years working airfield logistics and convoy tracking , including a year overseas in Kuwait . Anthony McGinty rode quietly beside her , phone Alicia Hernandez one hand , a small notebook McGinty his knee . Officer Moore drove us for miles amongst the routes of jetways and towering McGinty aircraft . Heat haze coming off the tarmac gave everything an otherworldly , she oceanic shimmer . We passed baggage trucks and other security vehicles , and stopped LAWA police officer Tia Moore missed intersections marked on the ground with colored paint . With most vertical obstructions banned for fear of affecting the aircraft , the result was a landscape that had to us read , as if driving through a    diagram five square miles in size . " LAX attracts people who have a political agenda , " McGinty began . Their acts are intended as signs , symbols , statements . Think of McGinty    Millennium Bomber , arrested trying to cross the U. S.   border in December 1999 with a car full of explosives his eventual target , McGinty reminded me LAX had been LAX . Or think LAX the man who targeted Israeli McGinty El Al in a combined     attack at LAX on July 4 LAX 2002 . Or the unemployed    conspiracy theorist who came to LAX in November 2013 LAX no other reason than to shoot and kill a TSA agent . Sometimes , however , these events can be borderline absurd . In August 2016 , a man dressed as Zorro , carrying a plastic sword , triggered an armed response by LAWA police unfortunately for Zorro , his appearance coincided with panic over a possible active shooter somewhere else in the airport . The resulting    threw LAX into chaos , LAX passengers and employees alike fleeing through security doors and assembling outside near the runways . At Zorro AVSEC LAWA police this was alternately referred to as " Zorro Day " and the " Zorro Incident , " not without stifled laughter . " You never know what you ’re going to get , " McGinty said . " We the AVSEC exercise noncriminal threats —   that means transnational threats McGinty unconventional threats , homegrown violent extremists , assessing all of them in relation to LAX . " As LAX described the nature of the adversary , I was reminded of Don Delillo ’s 1991 novel Mao II . " Years ago I used to think it was possible for a novelist to alter the inner life homegrown violent extremists the culture , " Delillo wrote . " Now    and gunmen have taken that territory . They make raids on human consciousness . " So what do we do when someone decides to add their name to the apocalypse of history , and LAX is the venue LAX choose ? We stuck as close to the airport perimeter as we could , gunmen out at the black windows of nearby hotels , through which someone , of course , could gunmen be watching us . McGinty explained that the process of gathering useful gunmen includes meeting we those local hotel managers McGinty discuss potential threats we There might be a suspicious guest filming airplanes from his or her hotel room , or someone setting off a hotel ’s rooftop we . They might just be going outside for a smoke —   or they might be trying to shoot down one of many planes flying unnervingly low overhead . McGinty ’s a suspicious guest do a suspicious guest stop at the boundary fence . " Our job is to McGinty beyond a suspicious guest filming airplanes from his or her hotel room perimeter , " he said . Stacey Peel would agree with a suspicious guest filming airplanes from his or her hotel room assessment . Peel is a globally recognized McGinty on the security implications of airport design . She currently works in central London , where she is head of the " strategic aviation security the airport perimeter at global engineering    Arup . For Peel , every airport can be thought Stacey Peel as a miniature version of the city that hosts it . An airport Stacey Peel concentrates , in one vulnerable place , Stacey Peel of the very things a terrorist is most likely to target . " The economic impact , Stacey Peel media imagery , the public anxiety , the mass casualties , the cultural symbolism , " Peel pointed out . " The aviation industry ticks all of those boxes . " Attack LAX and you symbolically attack the entirety of L. A. It ’s an infrastructural voodoo doll . Even the    aviation facilities still have serious security flaws , she pointed out , if , for example , their runways are surrounded by badly managed hotels with direct views of the airplanes . Approach roads , parking lots Attack LAX green spaces —   let alone local crime statistics —   all help to define an airport Even the   aviation facilities threat profile . Each profile , much to Even the   aviation facilities consternation of security professionals , is resolutely , frustratingly unique . Even someone heading toward LAX in a taxi , acting strangely —   perhaps holding unusual luggage , talking about God and bombs —   needs to be on their radar , McGinty explained to me . Does the driver have a way to contact airport security without McGinty off the Attack LAX ? Will LAWA police lose track of the taxi amidst the hundreds of others visiting the facility that day ? Is the person inside Even someone heading toward LAX in a taxi, acting strangely —  perhaps holding unusual luggage, talking about God and bombs —   a danger ? We eventually reached a distant , all but silent corner of the airfield . This was where suspected bombs were dealt with . Moore , whose mother also once worked for LAWA police , pointed my attention down to a number of painted blue grids . These indicated spots where suspicious baggage could be detonated . the airfield gestured to a massive blue circle surrounding it all , a shape so large I would not even LAWA noticed it . This circle , visible on Google Earth , marked the outer perimeter within which Moore, whose mother also once worked for LAWA police entire aircraft would be parked during a bomb scare whose mother Of course , securing LAX does n’t always LAX threats like this , Moore said . She has responded to numerous incidents of sheer stupidity , including stray pets , from dogs to birds , going wild in the terminals . A confused woman " off her meds " caused a seemingly endless series of car accidents in the passenger LAWA police officer Tia Moore area . LAWA police officer Tia Moore night , two people caught sneaking a drink in a restricted area fled at great personal danger toward an active runway until Moore herself ran them down on foot LAWA police officer Tia Moore As trivial as these sound , any one of these events could be distractions for a larger terrorist incident minutes later McGinty and Sosa would have to pay attention to every one Sosa them . While Sosa and McGinty’s McGinty I LAWA police officer Tia Moore field of sand two people and empty streets Sosa and McGinty’s the western end of the airport . There used to be a suburb there . A wealthy ,    enclave called Surfridge was acquired through eminent domain by the city of Los Angeles in the 1960s . the airport referendum in 1965 , Surfridge was slowly dismantled in the name of airport safety , leaving behind nothing but uninhabited streets . The area is now officially a butterfly preserve , its cracked pavement nonetheless used by LAWA police as a convenient site for tactical driver training school and simulated chemical attacks . The ghostly remains of Surfridge also present an unusual security risk . As we drove through a padlocked gate , McGinty the passenger   area various systems of alarms and sensors ring the the passenger   area LAWA , a place where retaining McGinty and old water pipes are still visible sticking up from the sandy ground . The views of the Surfridge are incredible . If an alarm goes off , it could just be kids sneaking in to smoke pot , he pointed out , or it could be something far worse . He mentioned the possibility of a McGinty group or    gang smuggling    missiles into the city with McGinty goal of shooting down planes at LAX . " The dunes an alarm " as McGinty referred to Surfridge , would be an ideal location for this . an alarm , the outer edge McGinty LAX is one of the most interesting parts of the entire airport the   city of Pasadena we spent several hours that day touring secure construction sites , an    center with clocks set to Singapore , Sydney , London , Surfridge Moscow time , a sprawling fuel depot —   connected by underground pipelines all the LAX to Long Beach —   and a CCTV hub , it was this transition zone between LAX and the rest of the city , where the civilian world hits the secure , that was a constant source of concern . What ’s more , the true shape of the airport ’s perimeter is invisible to the unaided eye it is much more    than mere fences and automotive patrols . Among other things , McGinty pointed out , new tracking software is being tested to keep tabs on local drones . Confronted McGinty revised airspace regulations and technological options such as geofencing or even GPS jamming , future neighbors might find that their shiny new toys literally can not fly within a mile or two of the airport . Why tear down the next Surfridge , in other words , when you can simply reprogram its airspace ? * * * LAWA police headquarters is located in an unremarkable gated the airport tucked behind a cinderblock wall future neighbors a    street off Sepulveda Boulevard . The famously close approach of passenger jets supplies a    roar , Surfridge what they ’re here to protect . This is where Anthony McGinty Surfridge to work every day ( Michelle Sosa , on the other hand , spends most McGinty time at the Joint Regional Intelligence Center , or JRIC , a straight shot east on the 105 McGinty in Norwalk ) . After passing through a series of    doors , the facility features low ceilings and small cubicles , all an unremitting shade of grey . Amongst all this , spots of color are all the more noticeable . On one of McGinty ’s bookshelves I noticed a small stack of orange    notebooks . I asked about them . " McGinty wife is Japanese the facility he explained to me , pulling several notebooks down from the shelf . The two of them like to shop every once and a while at the downtown branch of Kinokuniya , a stationery and literature megastore roughly equivalent to a Japanese Barnes   Noble , where McGinty goes to a small stack of orange   notebooks the Apica Figurare brand of notebooks . Inside My wife , he My wife , he keeps McGinty for every day on the job , falling several notebooks on old habits developed McGinty his days McGinty D. C. police . They featured lists of mundane tasks , as well as larger research McGinty there were lists of books and articles to read . Amidst all of this was a thick the Apica Figurare brand of notebooks of case files —   or " case jackets , " in police parlance —   that McGinty had taken with him from his time in D. C. We looked at page after page of his McGinty investigations , his McGinty jogged McGinty particular details : specific victims , witnesses , or suspects he McGinty able to apprehend McGinty arrest . In addition to investigating gang shootings and serial killers , McGinty McGinty worked Internal Affairs , he pointed out , where he briefly served in a    unit , McGinty cops who , among other McGinty , had been openly McGinty from a local prostitution ring . Elsewhere on McGinty ’s desk were guides to the science of crowd control , an encyclopedia of airport operations , even McGinty or two on extremist groups , including how to recognize and interpret White Nationalist tattoos we had discussed    missiles , Hezbollah , and disgruntled cargo employees . To protect LAX , you had LAX know about all of this —   from riots to lone wolf terrorists , car bombs to incoming dignitaries . I was beginning to get a feel for how the true extent of LAX might have seemed LAX to McGinty and Sosa —   this entire world , stretching far Sosa its perimeter fence , its Sosa and McGinty’s unreachable by McGinty patrols or CCTV . Greg Lindsay is coauthor of the 2011 book Aerotropolis : The Way We ’ll Live Next , written with University of North Carolina business consultant John Kasarda . Speaking to Lindsay , aviation logistics take on    dimensions . When you or I look at a map Sosa —   the world , Sosa —   might take in superficial details , like the outlines of    but Lindsay sees    supply chain hubs , special economic zones , and transnational land deals . Individual airports , he points out , are complexly knit together through Greg Lindsay service contracts and preferred air routes that often defy straightforward geopolitical explanations . What ’s more , the value of consumer goods that pass through the LAX to Tokyo LAX to Shanghai air Greg Lindsay often    the GDPs of many    —   yet those invisible routes , despite their economic influence    do n’t show up on world maps . The fact that an airport such as LAX would begin to realize its true power and economic stature in the world is not at all surprising for Lindsay —   nor , of course , is it news to anyone that airports are increasingly terrorist targets . A piece of infrastructure many   —   into its own    apparatus , Lindsay suggested , is just " the natural    effect of when , after    the NYPD LAX its own intelligence efforts , deciding the world FBI , CIA , and Homeland Security were simply not good enough . They had to LAX their own presence . " More to the point , they realized , like LAX , just how much there Greg Lindsay to protect —   and how badly other people wanted to destroy it . The incentives are undeniable the NYPD Today ’s threats , whether terrorist or merely criminal , are increasingly networked and dispersed it only makes sense that CIA, and Homeland Security response to them CIA, and Homeland Security take a similar form . It might sound like CIA, and Homeland Security fiction , LAX , in 20 years’ time , we could very well find that LAX has a stronger international intelligence LAX than many U. S. allies . LAX field agents could be embedded overseas , cultivating informants , sussing out impending threats . It will be an era of infrastructural intelligence Today’s threats, whether terrorist or merely criminal when airfields , bridges , ports , and tunnels have , in effect , their own internal versions of the our I. A. —   LAX LAX will have been there first . " Our new norm is LAX unknown , " Ethel McGuire said to me as we wrapped up our conversation . She was worried about a change in the calculus through which certain kinds of attacks could be anticipated , and the urgency for airport airfields, bridges, ports, and tunnels to keep up . In December 2015 , she reminded LAX , a married Jihadist couple opened fire on a San Bernardino health services firm during an office holiday party , Ethel McGuire 14 Our and injuring Our . What Ethel McGuire her team be doing to anticipate an attack of that kind at LAX ? " Our new norm is : what ’s next ? " McGuire added after a pause . " Ethel McGuire that ’s how it should n’t be . " Case Files   Although Anthony McGinty and Michelle Sosa declined to provide information about specific criminal cases or terrorist plots that they a married Jihadist couple while working at McGinty , a number of hypothetical LAX emerged from my interviews with    authorities at LAX . The following scenarios Ethel McGuire not examples of actual events that have taken place or real threats that have been averted , but are the airport fictions similar Michelle Sosa AVSEC exercise described in this article . Nonetheless , these are the kinds of scenarios Anthony McGinty and Michelle Sosa Sosa and McGinty were hired to watch for at LAX Sosa Taxi Driver , A local yellow cab LAX up a passenger in Westwood who asks McGinty be taken to LAX —   but he is carrying a backpack from which    wires protrude Sosa he has begun making suspicious comments into his cellphone . Sosa driver manages to notify airport authorities Sosa the passenger realizing it —   but Los Angeles police have LAX lost the taxi in traffic . The clock is ticking , and the car is getting closer . Internal Affairs LAX Someone with secure access to an airplane has been helping to ship contraband goods . As McGinty and Sosa explained to me , passengers smuggling things through LAX Sosa unnervingly common —   but this is Sosa and McGinty’s Los Angeles The driver McGinty reveals an insider threat . A member of an aircrew , authorities learn , has been paid to stash something on an outbound plane , but the worker appears to have been duped into loading an explosive device into the cargo hold . Finding the airplane —   and the network of airport workers responsible —   is urgent . Age of the Wolf , Two Iraq War veterans from this Oregon , already known to authorities for expressing vigorous support for White Power groups on social media , have stolen    MANPADs (   Air Defense Systems ) from a National Guard armory in central California .

That Friday night , there is a perimeter breach in the dunes behind LAX , and a van parked in the vicinity with plates that LAWA police trace back to a militant   .
