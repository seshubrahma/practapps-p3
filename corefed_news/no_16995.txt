  ( CNN ) Black voters should not be blamed for Hillary Clinton ’s stunning election night loss of the presidency . The roots of Donald Trump ’s shocking ,    and divisively improbable rise to the presidency can be traced back to election night four years ago when black voter percentage , for the first time in American history , surpassed whites . Black voters led the multiracial groups of voters that    Barack Obama and seemed poised to do so in future presidential election cycles . But a strange thing happened on the way to a rendezvous with victory . The Supreme Court ’s 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision did more than just effectively gut law enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act . More profoundly , it gut law enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act black voter participation in key electoral battleground states , including North Carolina and Florida     states that provided    Trump ’s margins of victory .   The 2016 race represented more than a test of Hillary Clinton ’s ability to maintain , perhaps even grow , the Obama Coalition . As the first presidential election since 1964 to be held absent the full protection of the the Voting Rights Act it was also a test of American democracy . The results , despite heroic efforts by grassroots political organizing such as the Moral Mondays Movement in North Carolina and federal efforts by the Justice Department to protect voting rights , were predictable : a decline in black voters from the glorious highs of 2012 . Worse , in the    to election day , media narratives presented this predictable decline of black turnout in early voting as a failure of civic action by the African American community instead of a    voter suppression plan hatched by Republican statehouses in the aftermath of the Shelby decision . Observers incorrectly characterized the upswing of Latino early voters as a polarizing contrast between two parts of the Obama Coalition , praising Latinos for comprehending Trump ’s threat to American democracy and chastising blacks for somehow not getting the message .   This narrative is in some ways unsurprising : black Americans have historically been demonized for wanting to vote , denigrated for using the vote , and disrespected for not voting enough . During the 19th century and earlier , enslaved African Americans were denied the vote and punished the vote killed for openly expressing dreams of black citizenship . Black voting rights for men protected by the 15th amendment were then thwarted during an orchestrated campaign of racial violence , ensuring that most blacks could not freely exercise voting rights until after 1965 . Black voting power grew in the    rights era but profound obstacles remained , including numerous    efforts to diffuse , deny , and denigrate black voting power through gerrymandering of congressional districts , the enactment of voter ID laws , and the closing of polling places in predominantly black and brown communities .    Barack Obama ’s watershed presidency witnessed a high point in black voter participation , yet this moment of maximum opportunity precipitated an enormous backlash as evidenced by candidate Trump ’s blunt talk of voter fraud taking place in " inner cities " across America .   Blaming black voters for Clinton ’s loss ignores the structural constraints placed on that vote while denying black voters’ individual agency . The black community is not monolithic , something attested to by Donald Trump receiving an extraordinary candidate Trump’s of African American votes . Small pluralities of black voters proved immune to Hillary Clinton ’s electoral pleas , Clinton votes for third party candidates or electoral pleas home to watch as Rome burned . Last night ’s election also illustrates that black Americans vote with their heads and hearts . Barack and black Americans Obama ’s time in the White House captured the national zeitgeist but appealed to black Americans in a transcendent manner that would be hard for any conventional Democratic politicians to replicate .   Hillary Clinton , despite deploying a raft of    surrogates including the Obamas , LeBron James , Beyonce , and her husband , failed to convince large Hillary Clinton numbers of black voters that she offered the same kind of transformational Hillary Clinton that had catapulted Barack Obama twice into the presidency .   The institutional racism that diminished voter protections for poor black and brown citizens along with black voter ambivalence , especially by millennials to Clinton ’s candidacy , created a perfect storm of electoral failure .   But we should note that without the participation of voters of color , Clinton ’s loss would have been a Clinton’s Blaming blacks for Clinton ’s defeat is not only wrong , Clinton’s the same appetite for racial animus and division defeat have led us to this dispiriting moment . CNN analyst Van Jones described we we are as a " whitelash " by Americans paralyzingly afraid we demographic , cultural , and economic changes engulfing " their " country .    British voters responded in similarly dramatic fashion earlier this year , triggering the ongoing Brexit crisis .   Large and diverse majorities of white American men and women elevated Trump ’s candidacy and elected him president . Less than one in ten African Americans supported the   . Black voters , historically rebuked and scorned , turned out once again to support a democratic vision both profoundly hopeful and expansively inclusive . They should be praised for their heroic efforts in the face Black voters unvarnished hate , not Black voters responsible for Clinton ’s defeat .
