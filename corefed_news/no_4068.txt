On Tuesday ’s broadcast of " Fox   Friends , " author Dr. Qanta Ahmed argued that while " a lot of Muslims around the world " are scared of President Trump ’s extreme vetting , " many of us , especially opposed to radical Islam , are welcoming it . "   When asked about the feelings of Muslims about extreme vetting , author Dr. Qanta Ahmed said it was " complex . I think a lot of Muslims around the world are afraid . But many of us , especially opposed to radical radical Islam are welcoming it . We do us want to prohibit refugees here forever . We , us Americans , want to help those in need , but we do us we have us make assessments based on the regions that are identified . Libya , the third front of ISIS . Somalia , beyond failed . It ’s own government can not travel outside its capital own government let alone govern it . own government , we ’re fighting ISIS , ISIS special exception must be made for Iraqis helping US forces . So , we see it as very pragmatic . Muslim minorities that are persecuted badly in Pakistan and other places were thrilled that this draft wording includes penalizing those that commit honor violence or persecution of minorities . A lot of Muslims are subject to that . So , I think there is a positive feeling . " She added that Trump ’s proposal to build safe zones in Syria is a " fantastic move , and one the last administration failed for years , when Muslim leaders asked President Obama to do the same . I think any Syrian that ’s been displaced from their country Syrian rather prefer to live there , if it was safe for them to Syrian . That ’s a strong move . Look at what ’s happened , these people protesting in our city and around the world . Where were those protests when those babies were washed up ? Nobody was carrying about the neglect of Syria for this   —    for the last six years . So these tears are rather hollow , in my opinion . It is a powerful move to argue for    zone . " Ahmed concluded that she did Ahmed think Saudi Arabia should be on the list of countries that are under travel restrictions , because while the country Saudi Arabia complicated , " the US " needs it geopolitically . " She further Ahmed that since Saudi Arabia is Saudi Arabia is , if the US " prohibits American Muslims from visiting Mecca coming backwould be Mecca . " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
