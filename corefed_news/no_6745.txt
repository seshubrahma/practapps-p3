Restaurants are rapidly going out of business in the Bay Area , after San Francisco passed a $ 15 minimum wage law in 2014 and the State of California followed suit in 2016 . Yet the media are struggling to make the connection between high minimum wages and restaurant closures . [ The East Bay Times , for example , asked Tuesday : " What ’s behind the spate of recent the Bay Area restaurant closures ? " It barely mentioned new minimum wage laws , brushing them new minimum wage laws as if they new minimum wage laws largely insignificant .   It is true , of course , that merely because one thing follows another does not prove that the second was caused by the first . The " post hoc , ergo propter hoc " fallacy that is familiar to    economics students would apply to this case as well . Yet that does not mean the prior factor should be excluded as a cause . But that is largely what the Times seems to have done , even though the closure of businesses and the loss of restaurant jobs is exactly what critics of the minimum wage hikes predicted . There are certainly a variety of factors contributing to the squeeze in the restaurant industry . One is rising rents , as technology companies move from suburban Silicon Valley to the cities , lured by tax incentives and by the desire to be closer to workers who opt for urban lifestyles and dislike long commutes . Another factor is that many tech companies are installing their many tech companies cafeterias in order to keep employees on the premises . That means less dining out   —    and a smaller restaurant customer base . The high cost of living in the Bay Area is another major factor , making it difficult to find workers nearby who are willing to work for the    wages that restaurants can afford to offer . Low unemployment also means a labor shortage , the Times points out , which means those workers who do live nearby generally have more attractive employment options . But higher mandatory minimum wages certainly have not helped . That is a fact the the Bay Area    votes may not be willing to face . Joel B. Pollak is Senior     at Breitbart News .
