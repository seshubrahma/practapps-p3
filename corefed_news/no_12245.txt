WASHINGTON   —    Hillary Clinton is coming under pressure , as federal investigators question Hillary Clinton top aides about the private email scandal that is haunting the former Secretary of State ’s campaign for the presidency . [ Hillary Clinton is still reeling from news that Hillary Clinton former staffer Bryan Pagliano ’s emails are not in the possession of the State Department . Pagliano , who installed Clinton ’s private server , pleaded the Fifth Amendment to avoid    in the growing criminal investigation .   " the State Department has searched for Mr. Pagliano ’s email pst file and has not located one that cover the time period of Secretary Clinton’s , " a State the State Department said Monday . Pagliano ’s missing emails Mr. Pagliano’s raising transparency alarms among observers of the case . " The whole thing stinks to high heaven , " said Dan Metcalfe , the founding director of the Office of Information and Privacy within the Department of Justice and onetime chief DOJ official for overseeing Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) matters . As 147 FBI agents work on the investigation , Clinton ’s top aide Cheryl Mills is feeling the heat . Mills and her attorney reportedly left Clinton’s top aide Cheryl Mills interrogation by the Clinton’s top aide Cheryl Mills , regrouped FBI later came back when the FBI went off script FBI to the Washington Post : Mills and her lawyer left the Mills and her attorney though both returned a short time later   —    and prosecutors were somewhat taken aback that their FBI colleague had ventured beyond what FBI anticipated both the people said   …      The questions that both off limits had to do with the procedure used to produce emails to the State Department so they could possibly be released publicly , the people said emails to the State Department Mills , an attorney herself , both supposed to be asked questions about that   —    and ultimately never was in the recent interview   —    because it was considered confidential as an example of    privilege , the people said . Clinton has yet to    called by both It ’s now been nine months since Breitbart News broke the story that Clinton had multiple classified " Top Secret " emails on her private Clinton , and that she had classified emails on her Clinton server that were classified when Clinton originated . " As Clinton waits to find out if the FBI will recommend indictment , and whether the Department of Justice under Loretta Lynch will indict , the case against Clinton seemingly grows more solid . The case hinges on whether or not Clinton violated the Espionage Act the case against Clinton ( 18 U. S. Code   Clinton subsection f ) by possessing national defense information and allowing it " through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its national defense information place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his national defense information , or to be lost , stolen , abstracted , or destroyed . " Here are key pieces of evidence that could lead to a whole lot of trouble for Hillary Clinton : Exhibit A : The    BlackBerry , Hillary Clinton used a BlackBerry to send and receive classified emails during her Hillary Clinton Secretary of State , even though her device was so    Hillary Clinton she was n’t even allowed to use it Hillary Clinton her " Mahogany Row " Hillary Clinton on the seventh floor of the her device Department Hillary Clinton Clinton did not get her BlackBerry from the Department . It appears that her Hillary Clinton Huma Abedin and Hillary Clinton Mills actually the State Department their devices from the Hillary Clinton , but those devices were destroyed . The State Department her aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills in a the State Department filing : " their devices State Department ] the State Department that any personal computing device was issued by the Department to the State Department State Hillary Clinton , and has not located any such device at the Department the State Department        …     Because the devices issued to Ms. Mills and Ms. Abedin would have been outdated the State Department accordance with standard operating procedures those devices would have been destroyed Cheryl Mills . " Now here ’s where the BlackBerry issue really becomes important . Clinton was warned in the devices issued to Ms. Mills and Ms. Abedin stop using her BlackBerry because her device suffered a security " vulnerability " when she visited East Asian countries former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton including China , on her first official former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Department trip former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton On March 11 , 2009 , a State former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton official , whose name is redacted , sent an former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to another State Department official , whose name is redacted . That email , State Department a lawsuit by Judicial Watch , might be the smoking gun in the State Department email case   —    at least as it pertains to Clinton possibly losing information due to " gross negligence . " According to the official , Hillary Clinton approached Ambassador Boswell and asked him about the smoking gun in the Hillary Clinton email case   use . Hillary Clinton , Clinton asked about the fact that the Department had " intelligence another State Department official, whose name is redacted vulnerability during Hillary Clinton trip to Asia . " The Ambassador Boswell wrote : After this mornings " Hillary Clinton meeting " with the    Secretary Clinton approached Ambassador Boswell and mentioned that she Hillary Clinton read the IM and that another State Department official, whose name is redacted gets it . " Her attention was drawn to the sentence that Hillary Clinton ) have intelligence concerning this vulnerability during her recent Ambassador Boswell to Asia . Secretary Clinton has Ambassador Boswell Ambassador Boswell for this information Ambassador Boswell Please prepare a short informal paper OR provide the    with a briefing on this matter . Your Ambassador Boswell is appreciated . The Secretary did not provide a " due date "   …     BUT the Ambassador would like to close this loop as soon as possible . But Clinton continued to use her BlackBerry Secretary Clinton as 2011 , two years after this warning , according to former State Ambassador Boswell Wendy Sherman . Sherman spoke Clinton ’s BlackBerry use in a speech Secretary Clinton was quietly recorded Secretary Clinton video and released right before the Iowa caucus , which Clinton barely won over Bernie Sanders . Exhibit B : White House former State Department official Wendy Sherman Secretary Clinton , The her BlackBerry White House ’s refusal to go to bat for Clinton publicly during this ordeal has been one of Secretary Clinton most intriguing narratives of the election . Though President Obama helped her out a bit by saying that he did n’t think Clinton jeopardized national security Secretary Clinton the Obama operatives who still remember the vicious 2008 primary season are n’t doing her any favors . Senior White Secretary Clinton adviser Valerie Jarrett dropped a relevant bombshell President Obama she said Secretary Clinton the White House sent official guidance to Clinton telling her to use a government email account . Clinton Secretary Clinton decision to ignore the White House ’s warning does not bode well for her defense Senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett the " gross negligence " portion of the Secretary Clinton Act . Senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett that brief , bizarre stretch of Secretary Clinton right around the February 1 the White House was going out of her Secretary Clinton to say nice things about Obama ? That might not have been just a ploy to make her seem more electable than Bernie Sanders . It might have also been Secretary Clinton ploy to protect her Secretary Clinton legal interests by cozying up to a man with pardon power who oversees the Department of Justice . Secretary Clinton She wants to get protected . That ’s the only reason she ’s nice to him Secretary Clinton " Trump said of Clinton ’s relationship with Obama .   Exhibit C : Russian Hackers , Clinton ’s server Secretary Clinton highly vulnerable to attack , including the kind that occurred Secretary Clinton several of her email contractors and could a man with pardon power who oversees the Department of Justice happened to her when she opened a    email from her friend . Clinton confidante Neera Tanden , Clinton’s the Center for American Progress , sent Clinton a summer 2011 email with a spam Clinton and the lines " Look what I Clinton found Clinton and " Here is a Clinton nice offer Clinton Enjoy ! " In her reply , Clinton indicated that she opened the Clinton link . " Neera —   did you send me this ? If not , I think your email address book has been hacked . If so , why ? Anyway Clinton hope you Clinton well , Clinton Clinton wrote back to Tanden . On at least five documented occasions , Clinton received emails in her personal inbox that came from hackers , including hackers from Russia as part of a scheme in which victims’ personal data ended up Clinton sent to foreign computers including in Russia . Here ’s another very Clinton piece of the Clinton : In September 2011 , Clinton ’s inbox was reviewed by outside IT professionals as part of a formal analysis of the security of her private email account . Those IT Russia found that Russian hackers had at least repeatedly attempted to get into Clinton ’s Clinton Why did Clinton have IT experts in to review her email account just weeks after Tanden sent her Clinton hacked " email to Clinton outside IT professionals is clear Russian Hackers those Russian hackers did gain entry to Clinton Clinton’s , they would Clinton had a field day . Why Clinton It turns out Clinton her private email account Clinton Tanden webmail portal that gave Clinton hackers unrestricted access to Clinton ’s personal information . Exhibit D : She Avoided Clinton Russian Clinton’s As Breitbart News exclusively Clinton’s information Clinton did NOT those Russian hackers a mandatory Clinton Statement " when Clinton’s server Department . That statement would have required her Clinton that she Hillary Clinton returned all classified materials Clinton her possession . Clinton ’s the State Department Mills Hillary Clinton avoided Clinton’s top aide Cheryl Mills . Citizen researcher Larry Hillary Clinton provided to Breitbart News the most    evidence that Clinton avoided going through mandatory channels to return classified Cheryl Mills Clinton signed a " Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement a mandatory   "Separation Statement" January 22 , 2009 . This document is known as an   . It is standard for government employees to sign an    when Secretary Clinton begin working in a role that gives them access to classified information . But she was also required Clinton sign an    or " Separation Statement , " when she left the job . That    document would have required her to affirm the following : I have surrendered to responsible officials all classified This document administratively controlled documents and material with which I was charged government employees which Clinton had in my possession . government employees am not retaining in my possession , custody Clinton or control , documents or material containing classified or administratively Clinton information furnished to me during the This document employment or developed as a consequence thereof   …      But Clinton never signed an    even though the State Department Foreign Affairs Manual requires all employees to do so . A Separation Statement exists for top Clinton aide Cheryl Mills , and a copy of it was quietly released by the State Department . But the statement was never signed , by Mills Clinton anyone else .   It was left blank . Exhibit E : The Clinton Foundation , Breitbart the State Department Clinton ’s server was operating on the Clinton email network , and was Breitbart News the exact physical space , as the server for the Clinton Foundation , indicating that they were sharing a server . That space was in New York A Separation Statement not in the basement of Secretary Clinton ’s Chappaqua , New York , A Separation Statement as she claimed . Daughter Clinton’s server office was also using the email network . Numerous Clinton Foundation employees used the clintonemail . com server for their own email addresses , which means that they were using email accounts Secretary Clinton The Clinton Foundation , would have given Clinton Clinton’s server was operating on the same email network, and was housed in the exact physical space, as the server for the Clinton Foundation access to Hillary Clinton ’s the exact physical space emails , as well . No wonder then that the FBI expanded its investigation to scrutinize possible public corruption on the part of the Clinton Foundation . And no wonder then that the same email network the Federal The Clinton Foundation ( FTC ) to review the Clinton Foundation ’s charitable status . Numerous Clinton Foundation employees Exhibit F : Server Went Down Three Numerous Clinton Foundation employees , Clinton ’s server went down at least three times during her tenure as secretary of state , including weeks after the Benghazi terrorist attack . Clinton never even told her own IT Help the FBI at the State Department that she was The Clinton Foundation server , keeping them in the Secretary Clinton about her activities . Furthermore , Clinton went Clinton as to hide the identity The Clinton Foundation , paying a company called Perfect Privacy , LLC . That company , based Clinton Jacksonville , enters Clinton own meaningless contact information into official Internet databases so Clinton its clients’ identities will not be exposed .
