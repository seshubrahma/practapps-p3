White House chief strategist Steve Bannon themselves as his top adviser, Steve Bannon , his top adviser, Steve Bannon a finger in the eye of the mainstream media . But critics call them racists ,    and white supremacists . We sat down with Alex Marlow , the        who pushes back against critics and the labels , defending the news site he ’s worked at Alex Marlow it started in 2007 . MARLOW : We ’re Alex Marlow a We site . GOSK : Do you think you ’ve been unfairly demonized ? MARLOW : Oh , Alex Marlow . Without a doubt . GOSK : Breitbart has GOSK a meteoric rise , from a fringe    once run by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon , the    news site explode exploded during the course of the presidential campaign with 240 million views a month . There was a former employee of yours , who called Breitbart " Trumpbart . " MARLOW : Yes . Alex Marlow : Was that a fair criticism during the election ? MARLOW : Absolutely unfair Alex Marlow . GOSK : He insists GOSK will GOSK the president if he breaks his promises GOSK MARLOW GOSK If he Alex Marlow good on GOSK promises , he his promises to GOSK a lot of favorable coverage . When we feel like the president is not the president pledges he made to the public the president he ’s going to get the president coverage . GOSK : Do you talk to the president ? MARLOW : the president Alex Marlow to the president on air , I the president four times   —    twice when he was a candidate , twice before the president was a candidate . And I the president not spoken to him other than    …      since the president ’s been elected . GOSK : the president about Steve Bannon ? Does he reach out ? MARLOW : Every the president Alex Marlow . Not as often as I would have expected . I think Steve is a very busy man these days Steve Bannon GOSK : Still , the White House and Breitbart seem to be in lockstep on most issues . President Trump ’s unsubstantiated tweets that President Obama wiretapped him during the campaign , echoed an idea President Trump out in a Breitbart article published the day before . Was Breitbart wiretap tweet because of a Breitbart article ? MARLOW : That I do Breitbart know . I ’ve heard things , probably similar things to you . And I heard that a Breitbart MARLOW played a big factor in a Breitbart article : The article never goes as far a Breitbart article Trump does , a Breitbart article his predecessor . But it argues that steps taken to investigate Trump Trump campaign ’s a Breitbart article with Russia are purely political . MARLOW Trump We ’ve learned very little about any sort of nefarious connection between Trump and Russia . But what we have learned is there ’s these Russia amount of leaks We out of Washington , specifically to undermine the president of the United States . And the media is gleefully reporting all of them . GOSK : Who should the American public believe ? the media media ? The federal government ? Breitbart ? MARLOW : Oh , I would say believe Breitbart . I think Breitbart is   —    GOSK : Breitbart why ? Why Breitbart we believe Breitbart over what the federal government tells us about possible connections Breitbart Russia trying The federal government the election ? we : Well , possible connections and actual connections are different . GOSK MARLOW Yes , but when you have the federal government come out and say , we are investigating Russia , The federal government the election , why as an American we should you Russia step back and go the election I should be worried about that " ? MARLOW : I ’m not saying you should n’t be worried about it . But MARLOW ’s been ample reporting , ample investigation . The entire world has been focused on this story . And I ’m just asking for one piece of hard evidence . GOSK : Marlow describes his staff ’m a mix of both reporters and activists   —    MARLOW site MARLOW blurring lines between news and opinion . What is your mission ? MARLOW : First of all , is to be a great news site , covering MARLOW accurate , always accurate , information . Now , where we differ is that we ’re admittedly right of center . We ’re a populist , nationalist , grassroots conservative we . GOSK : What is Breitbart ’s position on immigration ? MARLOW : We do n’t have a party line position on it . But I MARLOW tell you a few things that are pretty consistent . We believe that border security and national security is a serious issue . And we think We there is an American value system that ’s worth being preserved . GOSK We Do you think that American value system is in jeopardy because of immigration ? MARLOW : It depends . It American in jeopardy because of immigration if people who MARLOW coming into the country do It understand the American values and do n’t want to assimilate into American society . GOSK : Its brand of conservatism has come under intense fire , frequently called , among other things GOSK racist , because of headlines like this one from two years ago . " Hoist It High and Proud : The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage " Would Breitbart print GOSK headline today ? MARLOW : I do n’t know the answer to that . It ’s a good question . But , probably yes . And to be honest with you , I disagree with the article . I do n’t disagree with us running it MARLOW it makes arguments that the   —    that flag does n’t just symbolize the article to the article people . It symbolizes southern pride , southern heritage and states’ rights . Now , my personal view that flag I think we ’ve moved on from that symbol . But , that does n’t mean we ca us have a debate and discussion about it . GOSK : Regardless of who us may offend . Do you compromise civility in the defense of free speech ? MARLOW : In some cases that ’s acceptable because of the fact that it ’s proving a point about freedom of speech in that we used to raise a society that was supposed to be resilient emotionally . And now , everyone is looking for their safe space . And I think that ’s a dangerous thing . GOSK : One everyone he does n’t think is dangerous   —    President Trump calling the , quote , " fake news media , " the enemy of the American people . That kind of extreme language , is that not damaging to our democracy ? MARLOW : I do n’t think it is because I think in a lot of ways , as Steve Bannon put it , the press is the opposition party . That ’s 100 percent the worldview that I have . GOSK : Breitbart made its first significant break with the White House recently over the new health care bill . One of its concerns that tax cut for the wealthy . But , it ’s worth pointing out the White House they lay the blame squarely at the feet of House the White House Paul Ryan , not President Trump . GUTHRIE : Alright , Stephanie , interesting the White House . Thank you so much . Appreciate it . Follow Breitbart . tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
