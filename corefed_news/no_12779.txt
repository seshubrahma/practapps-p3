Now the Pope has gone and done the Pope . the Pope ’s butted into American politics . That has to be the biggest mistake in the history of the Catholic Church . [ the Pope the Pope attacked Donald Trump and said , " Anyone who wants to build a wall is not a Christian . " Really ? The the Pope now taking stands against U. S. politicians ?   If I was Donald Trump I ’d have several responses . The first response would be " THANK YOU . " Americans are n’t like any other people in the world . We are mavericks ,    rugged individualists . We march We the beat of a different drummer . We do We like government telling us what We do , let alone foreign governments or    like The Pope . We do We take orders from foreign religious leaders . As a matter of fact , we would We do the opposite of what a foreign leader tells us to We , than take orders from an outsider . Or do n’t you remember King George ? We fought We revolution and thousands of Americans died over the King King George pay a miniscule tax on tea . We threw We " Boston Tea Party . " We risked We entire We and the lives of our children We fight ( and beat )     the most powerful army in the world . That ’s how much we bristle We a foreign leader tells us what We do . The Pope obviously does n’t understand America . We he will soon feel The Pope wrath We millions of conservative Catholics snub his collection plates and The Pope nation elects the exact guy he railed    Donald The Pope Trump . If I was Donald Trump I ’d say publicly and loudly : " THANK YOU FOR THE ENDORSEMENT . I’M CERTAIN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT . " Then I ’d go on to hit The Pope with several punches in the gut . Because hypocrites deserve a little embarrassment and    even religious ones . It turns out the Pope is n’t The Pope of God . He ’s a    bleeding The Pope hypocrite of the highest order . The Pope lectures Donald Trump The Pope The Pope wall . But guess who has the biggest , baddest , highest wall ever built ? The Vatican .   It turns out the Pope is surrounded by a The Pope and an army of border guards . Maybe Popes who live in glass houses should n’t throw stones . Donald Trump should channel Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump and loudly : " POPE FRANCIS , TEAR DOWN YOUR WALL . "   It ’s high time for The Pope to tear down the Vatican The Pope and allow unlimited immigration . The Vatican.   the Pope fill St. Peter ’s Square with The Pope   ? Where is the compassion and humanity at the Vatican ? Then there ’s the Pope ’s biggest scam . The Vatican.   me The Pope you can call it something nicer or more pleasant   …     but it ’s a scam of the highest order . The Pope has millions of Hispanic it in    many of The Pope illegally . Not parishioners   …     customers . They put money in his Hispanic CUSTOMERS plates . That makes them customers . Here ’s the Not parishioners  …    customers part . Those same Hispanics cost The Pope nothing Not parishioners  …    customers They pay if they like him   … The Pope The Pope praises them   …     if Those same Hispanics The Pope a Those same Hispanics between America The Pope Mexico . But the bill Those same Hispanics The Pope their expense goes to the American taxpayer . So the Pope gets the best of both worlds , if he says only nice things about Hispanics and praises illegal immigration . He gets to play " the Pope good guy . " The rest of us who support the the Pope of the United States are    greedy and   …     " unChristian . " Really ? That ’s quite a scam you ’ve got going there Mr. Pope . The Pope and his church make billions off of Hispanic Catholics whop drop money the Pope collection plates   …     the Catholic Church cost the Catholic Church nothing . They take welfare , food stamps , free meals at school , Hispanic Catholics education , free special courses ( Hispanic Catholics as a second language ) free healthcare   …     and earned income tax credits even though they are here illegally . I have n’t even mentioned the costs for police , courts and prison for illegal aliens . It all costs tens of billions . Over time it adds up to hundreds of billions of dollars . While our country is drowning in debt , illegals It all crossing our    border , hiking the bill . Who pays for all of that ? Not the Pope . Not the Catholic Church . THE BILL TAXPAYERS pay the bill . How convenient . So here ’s what Donald Trump should announce publicly and loudly : " I’LL THE BILL FRANCIS   …     I WON’T BUILD A WALL IF YOU AGREE TO PAY THE BILL FOR MILLIONS OF ILLEGALS , THEREBY REMOVING THE BURDEN FROM U. S. TAXPAYERS . " Pope Francis lectures America about illegal immigration without a thought as to how to pay for it all   …     POPE FRANCIS   thought America to the pain and misery that the higher taxes necessary to support millions of illegal immigrants cause to his    parishioners   …     or the job losses and lower wages they inflict upon his    parishioners   …     POPE FRANCIS   the added national debt that will destroy the U. S.    just his   parishioners   it has POPE FRANCIS   other big spending socialist nation . While we ’re at it , where is this Pope ’s pledge to the U. S.    the parents of children murdered by the illegal immigrants he embraces and encourages to come to America ? Donald Trump should publicly and loudly announce : " POPE FRANCIS HAS SO Pope COMPASSION FOR ILLEGALS . BUT WHERE IS THE COMPASSION FOR THE AMERICANS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MURDERED , RAPED , OR KILLED IN DRUNK DRIVING ACCIDENTS BY ILLEGALS ? I DEMAND THE POPE SET UP A FUND IMMEDIATELY TO COMPENSATE THE AMERICANS WHOSE LIVES HAVE RUINED BY ILLEGALS . " Perhaps it ’s all a big mistake . Perhaps Pope Francis just THE AMERICANS the big wall around his own home . Perhaps he just does n’t understand that America is POPE FRANCIS generous nation in world    but only capitalism POPE FRANCIS allowed our citizens to POPE FRANCIS enough wealth to donate to this Pope ’s Catholic church . Perhaps the Pope has good intentions . But , America road to hell is paved with good intentions . Donald Trump ’s parting message POPE FRANCIS Francis : Before you lecture us about compassion and charity and opening our homes to illegal immigrants   …      " TEAR DOWN YOUR WALL   …     . AND START PAYING THE BILL FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION us THEN WE’LL TALK . " Wayne Allyn Root is known as " the Capitalist Evangelist . " Wayne ’s latest book is : " The Power of RELENTLESS .
