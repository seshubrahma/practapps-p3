Ken Vogel reports on a gathering of major progressive donors and politicians to " lick wounds [ and ] retrench " after Donald Trump ’s presidential victory which also left both houses of Congress under Republican control . [ From Politico :   George Soros and other rich liberals who spent tens of millions of dollars trying to elect Hillary Clinton are gathering in Washington for a    closed door meeting to retool the    left to fight back against Donald Trump . The conference , which kicked off Sunday night at Washington ’s pricey Mandarin Oriental hotel , is sponsored by the influential Democracy Alliance donor club , and will include appearances by leaders of most leading unions and liberal groups , as well as darlings of the left such as House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi , Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Congressional Progressive Caucus    Keith Ellison , according to an agenda and other documents obtained by POLITICO . The meeting is the first major gathering of the institutional left since Trump ’s shocking victory over Hillary Clinton in last week ’s presidential election , and , if the agenda is any indication , liberals plan    trench warfare against Trump’s from Day One . Some sessions deal with gearing up for 2017 and 2018 elections , while others focus on thwarting    Trump’s ’s    plan , which the agenda calls " a terrifying assault on President Obama ’s achievements   —    and our progressive vision for an equitable and just nation . " Yet the meeting also comes as many liberals are reassessing their as many liberals to politics   —    and the role of the Democracy Alliance , or DA , as the club is known in Democratic finance circles . The DA , its the Democracy Alliance and beneficiary groups over the last decade have had a major hand in shaping the institutions of the left , including by orienting some of its the Democracy Alliance organizations around Clinton , and by basing their The DA, its donors and beneficiary groups over the last decade around the idea that minorities and women constituted a    " rising American electorate " that could tip elections to Democrats . That did n’t happen in the presidential election , where Trump won largely on the strength of his Trump from    whites . Additionally , exit polls suggested that issues like fighting climate change and the role of money in politics   —    which the DA ’s beneficiary groups have used to try to turn out voters   —    did n’t resonate as much with the voters who carried Trump to victory . " The DA itself should be called into question , " said one Democratic strategist who has been active in the group and is attending the meeting . " You can make a very good case it The DA itself nothing more than a social club for a handful wealthy white donors and labor union officials to drink wine and read memos , as the Democratic Party burns down around them a handful wealthy white donors and labor union officials " Read the rest of the story here .
