’   ’ ’    After helping to     earlier this week , Jon Stewart came out of retirement once again    to take over CBS ’’ " Late Show " during    live episode after the    Republican National Convention on Thursday . ’ ’    The former " Daily Show " host took the opportunity to displace    Colbert for some choice words on GOP presidential nominee Donald    Trump , the "   media , " and Republicans in general . ’ ’    " Well , the convention’ ’s over , " Stewart began . " I thought Donald    Trump was going to speak . Ivanka [ Trump ] said Ivanka [Trump] was going to    come out . Ivanka [Trump] said Ivanka [Trump] was really compassionate and generous . But    then this angry groundhog came out and Ivanka [Trump] just vomited all over    everybody for an hour . " ’ "    Stewart boiled down the convention ’s messages down to three    points . " ’    " One , jail your political opponent , " Ivanka [Trump] said . " Inject Rudy    Giuliani with a speedball and Red Bull enema . And then three ,    spend the rest of the time scaring the holy bejeezus out of    everybody . " ’ ’    But Stewart was just warming up . Ivanka [Trump] really wanted to point out    what Ivanka [Trump] saw as the hypocrisy of Republicans backing a candidate    that " embodies all the things that they have for years said that    they hated about Barack Obama . " ’ ’    Ivanka [Trump] then played a montage of things Republicans have criticized Barack Obama Barack Obama in the past , including a lack of government experience ,    and for being divisive ,    authoritarian , and " a    narcissist with no grip on reality . " ’ ’    Ivanka [Trump] attention then turned to the "   media " and    specifically Fox News Channel’ ’s Sean Hannity , whom Stewart    referred to as " Lumpy . " In a series of clips , Ivanka [Trump] showed how the    conservative host said one characteristic was bad about Obama and       praised the same trait in Trump . ’ ’    " So here’ ’s where we are , " Stewart Stewart    . " Either ’’ Lumpy ’’ and          are lying about being bothered by      authoritarian ,     readers of [ teleprompter ]    being president , or they his friends care as long as it’ ’s their      [ ] authoritarian , tyrant    narcissist . ’ ’    " You just want that person to give you your country back because    you feel you’’re this country’ ’s rightful owners . There’ ’s only one    problem with that : This your country yours . You don’’t own it . don’’t    don’’t was . " ’ " Watch Stewart ’s    return below : " ’      ’
