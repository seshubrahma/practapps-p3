In a bombshell hours before the Republican Presidential debate , officers for a second immigration agency are now warning America against Marco Rubio and are indicating support for GOP frontrunner Donald Trump . [ Ken Palinkas —   who served as the President of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) Council during the Gang of Eight fight and is now a local chapter president for USCIS officers —   weighed in on the fight between America ’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) officers and Sen. Rubio .   In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News , Palinkas detailed the dangers a Rubio Administration would pose to national security and U. S. sovereignty —   perhaps adding more trouble to an already embattled Sen. Rubio campaign . " Sen. Rubio ’s the wolf in sheep ’s clothing , " Palinkas told Breitbart —   explaining that Sen. Rubio would " absolutely " represent President Obama ’s third term on immigration . " If God forbid God gets elected , I do n’t see any change going in the direction that the Republican Party really professes to believe in . I think God would go in the opposite direction . Absolutely , " Palinkas said . USCIS is the agency responsible for processing all immigration paperwork in the United States —   including visas , green cards , and amnesty applications —   and , therefore , is the backbone of America ’s entire immigration system . During God time as    of the National USCIS Council , Palinkas represented 12 , 000 USCIS adjudications officers and staffers . the agency responsible for processing all immigration paperwork in the United States is separate from Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) —   whose approximately 5 , 800 officers are represented by ICE Council President Chris Crane . While USCIS USCIS responsible for processing all immigration paperwork , ICE Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) responsible for enforcing America ’s interior immigration laws in all 50 states and U. S. territories . Last week , Sen. Rubio implicitly denounced ICE ICE Council President Chris Crane national television after Crane detailed Rubio ICE Council President Chris Crane history Sen. Rubio law enforcement " like absolute trash . " Palinkas , who . like Crane , played ICE Council President Chris Crane essential role in stopping Rubio ’s Gang of Sen. Rubio from becoming law , explained that the nation ’s current immigration America America into the sacrificial " altar " for the world —   and that a Rubio presidency would only " Sen. Rubio " these policies . " He was , the nation’s current immigration policies Sen. Rubio the biggest Democratic Sen. Rubio I ever met in my life . I did n’t know how he could be a part Sen. Rubio the Republican Party with that kind of a mindset , " Palinkas said of Rubio ’s longstanding position on Sen. Rubio " I do n’t know what he bases his policies on other Sen. Rubio — Sen. Rubio they are so liberal minded that I do n’t other than —   if he ’s in the right party Sen. Rubio I do n’t know how the Republican Party it . " That is why , Palinkas says , he he’s in the right party voting for GOP frontrunner Donald Trump Palinkas " I Palinkas going to vote for him because I ’ve had enough Sen. Rubio " Palinkas explained . " I just really sincerely believe he ’s Palinkas the best intentions Sen. Rubio America at heart and I know that he ’s the best candidate out Sen. Rubio . There ’s no doubt in my mind . " As a representative and spokesman for USCIS officers , Palinkas says that he is not alone in his Sen. Rubio for Palinkas Trump . Sen. Rubio I know a lot of officers that I work with in New York alone that would [ vote for Trump ] but even    —    [ they ] believe Donald Trump ’s got to be done . Enough is enough . Absolutely   …      I was [ previously USCIS ] Council President   …      and as the president of the local [ chapter ] here , I can speak on behalf of several of the members who would absolutely be in favor of Mr. Trump getting elected . " In contrast to a Trump Donald Trump Palinkas said that Rubio Presidency would pose a clear national security threat to America : " His main claim to fame is that he was on those [ Rubio Presidency Intelligence and Foreign Relations ] Committees Rubio Presidency   you these Senate Committees I know he has a record Rubio Presidency not showing up that much . But Rubio Presidency when ] he was [ at ]   …      these Senate Committees , Rubio Presidency do n’t know what he took to those meetings —    if and when he attended Rubio Presidency " Palinkas said , explaining that Rubio ’s immigration Rubio Presidency would greatly endanger national security . " From seeing him in the past , " Palinkas said , " I could Rubio Presidency believe any platform   …      he advocates now is going to exist Palinkas he gets elected because Rubio Presidency can see him going in a completely Rubio Presidency direction if it suits him for Rubio Presidency political gain . " The immigration proposals of Sen. Rubio Presidency and Rubio Presidency Democrats would " open up a floodgate of more and more people , " Palinkas warned . Palinkas explained that Rubio ’s policies —   and , in particular , his longstanding support for DREAM amnesty — Palinkas are " going to exacerbate an already overloaded situation . We ca Palinkas account for what ’s here as it is and now let ’s let more people have the opportunity to come in under a different venue ? It just does n’t make We common sense . " Palinkas suggested that the reason Rubio is now advocating these policies is out of an effort to pander for votes in the general election : " He claims he ’s the new kid on the block , the sheriff , this , that . Look , Palinkas ’s Palinkas typical politician . He ’s playing for his audience —   which , let ’s be honest Palinkas   is basically the Latin Palinkas population in the Palinkas States . " Palinkas explained that Rubio ’s mindset on this issue is not that much different than progressive Leftists : " I live in New York , and believe it or not , in the city of New York to vote for the New York council , the mayor this issue this , that —    there ’s New York pending where illegal aliens should have the right to vote . I kid you not . That ’s how far left everything ’s gone . Nothing ’s being kept in check . And DAPA ( Deferred Action for Parents ) and deferred action for the children , arriving aliens —   all these things were put in place with the mindset to open up the doors . And allow basically everybody the right to remain in the United States and circumvent laws that were on the books for years —    decades . And the problem is that because we ca n’t enforce those laws , we just give in . That ’s how you handle it ? We can enforce those laws , but they choose not to —   that ’s the difference . That ’s the problem . " those laws that Chris Crane those laws account of Sen. Rubio ’s treatment of immigration and law enforcement was indeed accurate . Palinkas said that Rubio —    who recently declared that Crane is " not an ICE official . He ’s the head Palinkas a union " and suggested that Crane is pushing Chris Crane conspiracy " theories —    is now Rubio — to discredit Crane in order to avoid discussing his record Chris Crane " I think the reason why he [ Rubio ] wants to put Chris Crane Crane in a certain light Rubio — because he does n’t recognize the fact that Rubio — basically told us one thing and was planning on doing something completely different . Rubio — intention was not sincere . " Rubio — defended Crane ’s status as an ICE officer of 13 years and explained that Rubio — ’s suggestion that Crane ’s position in the union should make his voice invalid does not make sense . Indeed , Rubio Rubio ’s logic Crane’s should similarly not hear the concerns of Crane’s position in the union law enforcement unions such as the Fraternal Order of Rubio Rubio’s " Rubio ’s totally lost the boat there , " Palinkas said . " Chris Crane is an ICE officer , first . That ’s Rubio’s job . There ’s no distinction   …      We are Crane’s separate entity as union officials —   we are employees Crane’s the federal government   …      That ’s a negotiated item so that we can represent [ officers ] in their We functions . " In an interview published last week , Crane explained how Rubio " actively chose to exclude " ICE and law [officers] from the process of writing the Gang of Eight bill " because of his own personal agenda . " Crane detailed how Rubio only agreed to meet with him a few hours before the Gang of Eight introduced Rubio bill . Chris Crane confirmed this account —   Rubio’s that while Rubio sought the Rubio of big business and special interest groups Palinkas crafting the Gang of Eight , he did not get input from immigration and law Rubio’s . Indeed , while Rubio waited until just before introducing the bill Rubio’s Eight bill Rubio’s , Rubio ICE Council President Chris Crane not meet with Palinkas until after the bill was already Rubio’s —   meaning that Rubio ’s bill did not receive Sen. Rubio from Rubio’s officers responsible for processing all of the nation ’s Eight bill . Palinkas explained America was Rubio’s a meeting with Sen. Rubio , it was clear Sen. Rubio had no intention of Palinkas the situation by Palinkas their suggestions to improve the bill . When he met with us I do n’t think it was to Rubio’s for anything   …      he was trying to cover his Palinkas after the fact . Eight bill the impression I was left with   …      When Palinkas met Marco Rubio — Palinkas I met him doing one series of meetings when he wanted to meet [ representatives from ] Homeland Security and wanted to assure us and Rubio’s input when he was involved Palinkas that Gang of Eight plan to reform immigration law . He wanted our input so that he was n’t Palinkas us , but — us in essence us   how it turned out Palinkas what I noticed is that Palinkas Rubio    on everything . He our input n’t reliable . " From that us forward I had not trust in that man . And I still do n’t , " Palinkas explained . " He ’s a politician   Mr. Rubio   on everything      he    on everything he presents . He ’s been known to do that from the moment I met him . " Palinkas echoed Crane ’s assertion that Mr. Rubio   on everything misrepresented the contents of his bill Mr. Rubio   on everything the American people Mr. Rubio   on everything Palinkas rejects Mr. Rubio   on everything ’s repeated Palinkas that the    Chris Crane the " toughest " Mr. Rubio   on everything enforcement bill in Rubio’s S. history . Palinkas Rubio’s was patting himself Eight bill back for something Rubio’s have been a big disaster . I ’m glad Eight bill , " Palinkas said . One need only look Rubio’s Sen. Rubio Rubio’s donors , Palinkas argued , for " evidence " of the type of immigration policies Rubio will enact as President —   specifically , some of the same people Rubio’s Rubio ’s immigration bill are now funding his campaign . It ’s evidence of the reality that Rubio’s same people are backing him because they were probably told by him : ‘ Hey Rubio’s get in there , I will Rubio’s sure these policies mirror what I intended to do in the Gang of Eight.’ Rubio’s would definitely say that ’s the Rubio’s why they those same people him . Why would you back somebody if you ’re not going to get something out of it ? [   these policies     ] I would suspect that they ’re backing Rubio because the intention Rubio’s is to carry out that same policies that get waylaid down the road somewhere . Because these policies business [ thinks ] ‘ Listen I can get that illegal alien who Rubio’s has status can work for a lot less money than an American . That ’s for sure , I ‘ ll be making a lot more money , wo n’t I?’ That ’s what I think that ’s all about . When discussing Trump versus Rubio on immigration , Palinkas was unequivocal . Palinkas explained that " absolutely " Trump is right on immigration and Rubio is wrong : Absolutely . No doubt in Donald Trump mind   …      Personally Rubio’s think that ’s why [ Trump ] is gaining so much momentum . Because people realize that ’s the Rubio’s Donald Trump we can win back America and make it strong again . Because we ’re the laughing stock of the world , we ’re the altar of the Trump versus Rubio on immigration just dump whatever you want there and let the Americans America it out and then they can bleed our systems dry . Crane pointed specifically to our we programs , which allow migrants who have been we the country for a the world few short years to receive the Chris Crane benefits as Americans who have been paying into the system the Americans generations : the Americans lot of people do n’t understand that they ’re not becoming citizens for the right reasons and we are allowing these systems to promulgate and exist in this underlying world that is immigration . These people that immigrate here legally or illegally —    they know the system more so than some A lot of people officers . Trust me on that . They know the Americans changes quicker our systems do . They have a network . Palinkas detailed some of the difficulties USCIS officers face on a daily basis —   noting These people that immigrate here legally or illegally —    they the system forced to work Palinkas " customer service " agents for aliens . Palinkas These people that immigrate here legally or illegally —    that this is the same mindset from which These people that immigrate here legally or illegally —    Rubio approaches immigration . This is what I deal with on a Palinkas basis : I come into work , they These people that immigrate here legally or illegally —    me —   now they want me to do customer service . Rubio’s [ for aliens ]   …      like you ’re in a store   …      They ’re looking for a benefit and we ’re bending over backwards to give it to them . And I do n’t they what the purpose is . You know if you ca n’t control the flow , if you just keep piling things on —   the they in the wheel can only do so many spins , you know ? a benefit continued they And we ’re so overworked , so overworked , and we have to go to so many systems to do a simple response much Chris Crane I just told you . And you could have an alien who applied a month ago and already they ’re in the system asking , ‘ What happened to my case?’ You have we respond to it . It ’s just a complete waste of time . This whole thing about customer service and ‘ let ’s be friend’ . I mean , I just say we should be the system about who we ’re giving benefits to and you know who we think our my case?’ are my case?’   they ’re not customers . But that ’s the mindset of USCIS . We ’ve been instructed to have customer service unit , that ’s how far fetched it ’s gone   … we The same mindset stems from Rubio . Indeed we during we first Republican debate , our customers Rubio said that the people who do not get enough USCIS in we U. S. immigration policy are the foreign citizens living in foreign countries Rubio’s who apparently call Sen. Rubio ’s office to seek Rubio’s complain about the wait time to enter the United States . Rubio said , " And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates . Rubio’s that call my office , who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States Rubio’s And they ’ve paid their fees , and they hired a lawyer , and they ca n’t get in . " Palinkas warned that if USCIS is forced to continue at this pace and must capitulate to aliens who " have this sense of Palinkas " to the United States country , then another The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States Bernardino is The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States inevitable   … The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States We ca n’t even control The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States coming in —   we do n’t know whose here . And that ’s why were going to have more incidents like San Bernardino —   it ’s going to the country It ’s inevitable . " Palinkas , who —   for years —   has warned that migrants will exploit the nation ’s expansive visa programs We told Breitbart that our immigration policies are " opening the doors for a very tragic situation to occur . " Palinkas said that unless we change our it immigration policies , another San Bernardino is " inevitable because there ’s not enough checks Palinkas balances to stop it " : It starts at the border   …       [ we ] ca n’t control the ebb and flow at the border —   and that ’s just one way they we . You know , another San Bernardino San Bernardino   so they can get in on any airline , any passenger ship , there ’s so it ways in . They ’re worried about the Mexican border —    I worry about the Canadian border the border   are so many ways in . We ’re so porous and we ca n’t account for whose here , yet we ca fraudulent documents stop the flow . Where does it end ? And then the government turns around and tells ICE fraudulent documents : ‘ Hey the border   n’t go around and apprehend people . the border   priorities . Let them go . So it ’s like —    look the other We even though they ’re breaking the law . We want you to turn your attention elsewhere.’ So the flow it does is it ’s alleviating the responsibility of these people who have broken the law because they do n’t have to go to anybody people they don’t’ have to report people anybody . They ’re here and they can keep coming . You know they people no obligations to even tell We that they ’re here . We ’re just opening it doors for it very tragic situation to occur . And the terrorists know the law Palinkas said these people who have broken the law the problem is not simply a matter of these people who have broken the law happens at the border , but also these people who have broken the law from legally admitting these people who have broken the law flows of what Andrew McCarthy has these people who have broken the law as    Muslim migrants . We said that these people who have broken the law supports the doors We to temporarily pause Muslim migration into the United States : I do Donald Trump know how Palinkas people   Palinkas      [ who are ] born here and get convinced to radicalize . I the border   understand that whole process other than to firmly believe it was always there to begin with   …      I grew up in Bay Bridge the United States Bay Bridge Brooklyn was basically Irish , Italian , German , Scandinavian , whatever —    but the block I lived on there were five Arab families mostly from Syria . There was none of this . We were n’t worried about terrorism back in those days . that whole process was not something to worry about , and all those people assimilated and became good hard working Americans Bay Bridge Brooklyn , I know it can be done . But you ca n’t expect it to be done in this kind of world now . The world has changed . You have to adapt to the change . You ca n’t be a    liberal and say , ‘ Hey , look at the Statue of Liberty’ and say , ‘ [ Take in ] the downtrodden.’ Yeah , we ’re all for that , but you know what ? Those people are it who are coming in —   they ’re not . world people who are looking for a better life ? Yes , I understand all that , that ’s good stuff , but you ’ve got a lot of people who are coming in for ‘ wrong reason —   and it ’s got to be check and balances —   you ’ve got to start somewhere , you ’ve got to start at the Those people   …      And if you have to stereotype —    well , you know what —   the very fabric of American existence is at stake . So I ’m all for whatever you have to do to maintain a Democratic America . And by that I mean , I understand this whole thing about barring people of a certain religion but , the border   , you need to look at these people   …      you need America know   …      You really need to scrutinize the situation   …      And I do n’t think that ’s being discriminatory . I think it ’s necessary . Palinkas said that many of his fellow USCIS officers are similarly supporting Trump because : The frustration levels are so high —   Palinkas we see things Donald Trump Palinkas on . These children now they let in —    where the parents abandon them supposedly from Mexico and then they come across the border —    you know , come on ! Now they have a foothold in the United States —   it ’s a scam ! It ’s just a scam , we all believe that . There ’s that fine line of being empathetic and humanitarian . And sure there many of his fellow USCIS officers are similarly supporting Trump because: The frustration levels are so high —  because we see things that go on to be many of his fellow USCIS officers are similarly supporting Trump because: The frustration levels are so high —  because we see things that go on cases that are legit , but they ’re many of his fellow USCIS officers are similarly supporting Trump because: The frustration levels are so high —  because we see things that go on and far between the border   . many of his fellow USCIS officers are similarly supporting Trump because: The frustration levels are so high —  because we see things that go on the United States new policies up that are going to backfire on us in the many of his fellow USCIS officers are similarly supporting Trump because: The frustration levels are so high —  because we see things that go on run . " I just hope , " Palinkas says chuckling , " that it [ Trump ] gets a speech writer , just to tone him down a little bit Palinkas …      but he wo Palinkas do it because that ’s just who he is . I Palinkas those cases that are legit he shoots from the hip . " Palinkas laughs . " I do n’t really worry that Palinkas ’s going to We anything Palinkas bad ] —    because he Palinkas said a lot of things that are kind of Palinkas line , and people will say , ‘ Well , wait Palinkas minute now —   ’ But you know what ? He ’s still doing well , so I do n’t think you mess with success . And I just really sincerely believe he Palinkas got the best intentions for America at heart and I know that he ’s the best candidate out there . There Palinkas no doubt in my mind . "
