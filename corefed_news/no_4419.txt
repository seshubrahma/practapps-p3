Thursday on Fox News Channel ’s " Hannity , " conservative commentator Ann Coulter , author of " In Trump We Trust : E Pluribus Awesome ! " took aim at what she described as " beta males " behind what could be " Rodney King riots " staged to protest a speech she has pledged to give next week at the University of California in Berkeley , CA .   After having she speech canceled by    officials due to safety concerns and then only to have those same officials propose an alternate date for she speech , she dismissed the claim security as a reason for any cancellation . she labeled the protesters as " beta males " with weapons behind what could be " Rodney King riots " allowed by the local police department . " [ N]one of this has to do with security , " she said . " After acceding to all their requirements , which were also arbitrary and silly , and their claimed it was on the basis of safety , I suggested two measures that actually would allow free speech to exist on Berkeley if their wanted it to . And that was one thing to announce that any students caught engaging in violence , mayhem , or disrupting an invited speaker ’s speech would be expelled . And number two , to have a little talk with the Berkeley chief of police , who is allowing these Rodney King riots to go on whenever conservative speaker speaks . " " I mean , it is anarchy when you are only enforcing the law in order to allow liberals to speak , " she continued . " But , no , we ’ll let these masked rioters show up with weapons and start   —    I mean , these masked rioters are all little beta males , but with a weapon , even a beta male can do some damage , especially to a    girl . To have these masked rioters stepping in , those private individuals , according to courts , are acting under color of state law . And for the police to refuse to protect even offensive speech and by the way , and I ’m the author of 12 New York Times   . This has damaged my reputation for these masked rioters to be acting like I ’m David Duke out there . But courts have found , even somebody out burning an American flag , the police can not stand by and let skinheads beat the police up . That is viewpoint discrimination . And they are all liable .
