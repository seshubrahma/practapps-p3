’   ’ ’    At a rally on Saturday , Donald Trump suggested   —    with no evidence     —    that Hillary Clinton   and Donald Trump proposed    that drug tests should be required before the next debate . ’ ’    " I’’m willing to do it , " Donald Trump said of mandatory    drug    testing . ’ ’    Hillary Clinton   should take Hillary Clinton   up on the offer . ’ "    You may remember former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean got in some    trouble for   after former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean    sniffled former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean way through the first debate . Not unreasonably ,    Trump ’s supporters complained that this was a baseless    accusation . " ’    But now ,   Trump has chosen to put the " Who acts like they    are on drugs ? " issue in play . And   —    like " Who’ ’s gropiest ? "   —    it’ ’s    a question Trump   Trump the campaign to focus on . ’ ’’ ’    Clinton , after all , is not the candidate in this race whose mood    and energy level are wildly erratic . She is Clinton the candidate who    goes on 3 a. m. . She is Clinton the    candidate whose accusations against her opponents Clinton to be    projections of her own Clinton . And she is Clinton the candidate    with a case of the sniffles . ’ ’    I am not saying Trump has a drug problem . He probably Trump has a    defective personality that causes him to Trump as though he has Trump a drug problem . ’ ’    But , as Trump notes Trump the only way to tell for sure is if the    candidates take drug tests . ’
