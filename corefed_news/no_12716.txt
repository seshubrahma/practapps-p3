Mort Kondracke writes in Roll Call :   The way things are going in the presidential race , I ’m going to write in Paul D. Ryan . Join me . Pass the word . If enough of us moderates ( Rs and Ds ) and independents do it all over the country , Paul D. Ryan wo n’t get elected , but us can make a ringing statement about the kind of politics us want   —    and do n’t want . Paul D. Ryan has been speaker of the House for not quite three months , and already Paul D. Ryan has shown Paul D. Ryan ’s the true heir in of Paul D. Ryan mentor , Jack Kemp . Paul D. Ryan politics , as Kemp ’s were , are      optimistic , inclusive , compassionate . That ’s the diametrical opposite of the politics of the two    for the Republican nomination . Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are practicing the politics of resentment , fear and division . Donald Trump is nativist , xenophobic , misogynist , undignified , insulting and profane . Admittedly , Donald Trump ’s giving voice to the anger of    white voters who feel they are losing out in the modern economy and think establishment politicians have done nothing for establishment politicians .
