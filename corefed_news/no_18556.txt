Actually , it ’s harsher than that . In Kalanick ’s world , the    losers do n’t get to play the game anymore . " "    The result has been a near monopoly , but a costly one : Uber is    losing vast amounts of money to retain    position and the    dominant player in   . But Lyft , stubbornly , is n’t    going away and ca n’t seem to be spent out of existence .   " "    Columbia Business School professor Evan Rawley   that this means Uber can hope for is    to become the leader of an oligopoly   —    a troubling proposition ,    given Uber ’s Uber , the need for investors to get a    payout at some point , and the ongoing cost of being the biggest . " ’   ’ "    Dealing with this challenge is going to require far more    technocratic leadership that what Kalanick can provide , and    that ’s why the Uber board has Uber looking for a Chief Operating    Officer to transition the company from being a scrappy street    fighter to a mature corporation whose practices wo n’t freak out    conservative institutional investors . " "    As a practical matter , getting rid of Kalanick is difficult due    to Uber ’s compliant Uber and his equity power Uber the company   —      like most founders in Silicon Valley , he ’s rigged Uber shares so Uber that his    counts    far more than everybody else ’s .   " "    But Kalanick could , and I stress this , be a    person of more complicated character than Uber ’s early narrative    would indicate . He ’s clearly Kalanick , and he ’s clearly Kalanick devoid    of conscience    as his resignation from Kalanick Trump ’s advisory    council amid protests over the administration ’s failed travel ban    indicated . We should n’t be so cynical to assume that a hard and    damaged man    n’t reinvent himself . There a hard and   damaged man second acts in    American life . " ’    Which isn’’t to say that we should accept this whole " Travis 2 . 0 "    thing , oozing as it does with Silicon Valley privilege , at face    value . Travis 2 . Travis 2 have a higher and better future , but    maybe it isn’’t    Uber 2 . 0 . The worst case scenario is    obviously that Travis    . 0 Travis 2. 0 on his    agenda .   ’ ’   Uber ’    Early on , I liked Uber and was an avid customer . But Uber ’s       approach to business always rankled me , and the    swiftness by which " Uber " became a favored verb , a Uber of    one’ ’s hipness to the disruption , was disturbing . This was , after    all , a company that seemed to enjoy skirting laws and making    life hard for its drivers . ’ ’    Living in    New York area , I went back to yellow cabs . Part of    this was practical   —    raising my hand to get a ride is easier than    fumbling with a phone . But part    it was also the result of how    Kalanickism had suffused Uber . I figured I had to take a stand ,    and so I switched over to Lyft    case I needed a backup for      taxis . ’ "    None of this had anything to do with the evidently toxic    workplace culture that Uber engendered , but I ’m not surprised Uber that the company ’s crisis has revealed    morass of sexism , bad    behavior , and exploitative business practices in need    of immediate remedy . The bottom line is that I just had a    bad feeling about Uber than I could n’t shake . " Uber    What Kalanick ’s leave proves is that even with Silicon Valley    startups , there ’s a moral element to how we    interact with   —    and , as journalists , cover   —        enterprises . They do n’t get a pass because a large part of their    mandate is to obliterate and dynamically They old ways of    doing things . In fact , they need    rise to a higher level of They ethical scrutiny due to the heavy amount of    that ’s    baked into their DNA . " "    It ’s difficult They not be dazzled by the billions . But you still    have to look at yourself in the mirror    morning . " ’•Kalanick now needs to put his life ahead of . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’•Kalanick
