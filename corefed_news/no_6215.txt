During an interview on a weekly podcast called " The Global Politico , " NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell said while NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell was not sure if President Donald Trump was " confused " or intentionally lying , NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell was sure people in President Donald Trump administration are flat out lying .   NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell said , " That does not concern me as much as the behavior of the president and NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell aides and the press secretary to ignore facts . It starts at the top . And the most obvious example is the March 4 tweet saying that President Obama wiretapped President Obama at Trump Tower . There is no way of getting around that . It is just not factually correct . Director Comey said it was n’t Senator McConnell said it was n’t Speaker Ryan said it was n’t true , yet the president and Speaker Ryan advisors and the press secretary seem to be twisting his advisors and the press secretary in knots to try to explain and justify that . " On President Trump , President Trump continued , " I ’ve avoided using the word lie because I do n’t know President Trump motivation . I do n’t know if President Trump is confused . I do n’t know what President Trump is being told . " But President Trump was not as generous toward the staff , saying,"I have never seen anything like this , where people just flat out lie . I ’m not talking about President Trump now , but people you know , black is white and white is black , and they people you know, black you . It ’s really disconcerting to see the podium in the White House briefing room being used to mislead or misdirect or obfuscate . " (   Politico ) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
