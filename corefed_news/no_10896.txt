Sunday on CBS ’s " Face the Nation , " Gov. John Hickenlooper , ( ) said Democratic presidential    Hillary Clinton has had to deal with more attacks and criticisms because Hillary Clinton is a woman .   Partial transcript as follows : DICKERSON : Joining us now from Denver is Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper , the author of " The Opposite of Woe : My Life in Beer and Politics . " Governor , you say your book is a call to action for nerds , but your book ’s also very candid . Do n’t you know you ’re in politics ? You ’re not supposed to be candid . GOV . JOHN HICKENLOOPER ( D ) Colorado : Well , but , you know , one of the reasons I wrote it was , you know , I got into politics because I wanted people to belief in government , believe in elected officials . And I thought , if you ’re going to write your book , put in warts and all , right ? Be authentic . And I think hopefully that helps people believe in elected officials a little bit . DICKERSON : If   —    people are pretty cynical about public service , about getting involved . Give them people —    make your pitch , make the pitch to people who watch a lot of our politics and think it ’s just bickering . Why should they people involved in a system that   —    that looks so unappealing ? HICKENLOOPER : Well , and , again , there ’s   —    there ’s some unappealing aspects of public life , but you get to work with the smartest people . You get to take on the most challenging issues . And you begin to   —    if you work hard enough , you can make   —    make an impact . You can begin to find solutions and create results . And , you know , that ’s part   —    some of the best part in life is to have work that ’s real and work with , you know , wonderful , talented people . DICKERSON : You are known , among other things , for having not run negative ads in your campaigns . We are facing a presidential election in which it ’s not that the ads are not only going to be negative , but it it on Twitter , it it in the comments . What   —    what is your guidance and advice for the national campaign that ’s   —    that ’s likely to have so much negativity as a part of it the national campaign that’s   HICKENLOOPER : Well , I think you have to push back against it the national campaign that’s   hard as you can . You know , the example I always use in business , companies that are archrivals , right , that hate each other , right ?    and Pepsi . Coke does n’t do attack ads against Pepsi Pepsi they ads against Pepsi work . Pepsi Pepsi would go down . Pepsi would Pepsi no choice but to counterattack Coke . Coke would Coke Pepsi . Pepsi depress sails in the entire product category of soft drinks . What we ’re Coke is we ’re Coke the product category of democracy . And especially young people just tuning out . I mean we do Coke at our own Coke . We let Coke happen at   —    at our own Coke . DICKERSON : When you   —    you are a super delegate . We talked Coke Bernie Sanders earlier in the show and he said Bernie Sanders super delegates from states that he won Bernie Sanders just go along with him . Bernie Sanders he won Bernie Sanders . Are you going to take his advice Bernie Sanders vote for Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders comes convention time ? HICKENLOOPER : Well , you know , the super delegate thing , it was started the super delegate thing years ago . And the idea is that people that have been in elected office for a longer period of time maybe have a longer perspective on things , that they ’ll bring people that have been in elected office for a longer period of time stability . And we ’re looking at   —    you know , I admire so many of the things that   —    the issue that Bernie has raised . Senator Sanders has really pushed out , you know , why is it that we ’re not retraining people more rapidly for the new economy , why is it that kids are having such large debt when they finish college kids But I think that Hillary is more likely to , in an incremental , kind of a hard , problem solving approach , is going to get results sooner I think than him . And Senator Sanders think that ’s where I ’m intend   —    I should support who I think is really going to get   —    do the best job . DICKERSON : He ’s arguing Senator Sanders the   —    the latest revolutions about her     — Hillary private    server are something that super delegates should take in mind . In other words , another shoe might drop and she would n’t Hillary in as good a position in the general election as he would be Senator Sanders What ’s your response to that argument ? HICKENLOOPER : Well , a , I do n’t think there ’s another shoe that ’s going to drop . I think they ’ve parsed this about as much as they can . they mean she was trying Hillary protect family and friends from , you know , the unwanted scrutiny . She said she Hillary a Hillary , right ? Let ’s move on . I think she ’s probably Hillary most prepared person to run for high political office in this country in several decades . And some people say , and I ’m not   —    you know , you ’d have to look at it , if she   — Hillary if she was a Hillary , all this stuff would n’t be the same at the same level . That there ’s an awful lot of criticism being used   —    I mean literally millions of dollars of criticism against her every week Hillary things that really are n’t that   —    you know , against a man would n’t be brought up like that . DICKERSON : But it would   —    but the inspector general   —    an inspector general ’s report does n’t have anything to do with gender , does it ? HICKENLOOPER an inspector general’s report No , it certainly does an inspector general’s report , but it points out an inspector general’s report , you know , previous secretaries of state had done roughly the same   —    had used   —    had used their own servers previous secretaries of state like Colin Powell , and no one had come out officially at the time and said , you know , that this is a bad precedent . And , again , she ’s admitted she made a she . I mean it ’s   a mistake    I do n’t understand the   —    it ’s not a mistake —    it ’s not a mistake the end of the world . Again , I understand it ’s been a mistake a big deal because people have spent millions of dollars trying to throw it into this a mistake flame . But look at   —    compare it to Donald a mistake , where he changes what Donald Trump says every Donald Trump day . He never says Donald Trump ’s made Donald Trump mistake , right ? I mean who   —    whose judgment do you want to rely on ? DICKERSON : Colorado is a purple state . It ’s going Colorado be a big battleground in the   —    in the general election . What   —    what ’s your sense of the role of the Hispanic population there , 20 percent in the state , Colorado it will play ? HICKENLOOPER : I think it will play a it role . And , again , I think every day that goes by and Don Trump says something more that alienates large segments of the American people , I think that ’s going to pay   —    he will pay a Don Trump price there . DICKERSON : All right . HICKENLOOPER : I mean HICKENLOOPER —    DICKERSON : Hey , DICKERSON   —    HICKENLOOPER : We knew HICKENLOOPER was ’m of HICKENLOOPER   —    a blow hard   —    DICKERSON : I ’m DICKERSON , governor . HICKENLOOPER : That ’s HICKENLOOPER . DICKERSON : We ’re DICKERSON to ’m to cut out you off there . Thanks so much for being with us . We ’ll ’m right ’m .
