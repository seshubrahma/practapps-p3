LE LUC , France   —    When the French put a draft Constitution for a newly enlarged European Union to a referendum in 2005 , Pascal Verrelle voted passionately against a newly enlarged European Union   —    hoping a newly enlarged European Union would stop a newly enlarged European Union in its tracks a newly enlarged European Union He rejoiced Pascal Verrelle the effort failed , yet was dismayed when the bloc a newly enlarged European Union more members and powers , anyway . At the time , Mr. Verrelle , a former soldier , was a prison director , but he eventually felt Pascal Verrelle to enter politics and joined the    National Front . When he was elected Pascal Verrelle of this small town in Provence eight months ago , the first thing he did was Pascal Verrelle take down the European Union flag from City Hall . " In 2005 , a majority voted against Europe , and we still find ourselves in Europe we by Europe , " he said , Pascal Verrelle and I find it inadmissible . " Today the European Union European Union the weight of problems encouraged in part by that unchecked expansion   —    stagnant economies , the euro crisis , new pressures from Russia and deep strains over migration , especially from newer members in Central and Eastern Europe . But a visit to Le Luc and other villages in southern France is a reminder that the European Union faces yet another serious problem long in the making   —    a crisis of legitimacy   —    that is fueling    nationalist politics even in the traditional core of the bloc . For Mr. Verrelle , 2005 was a watershed . Since then , opposition to a    poorer and vastly more diverse European Union has only increased the European Union has support for the National Front and its leader , Marine Le Pen the National Front who has emerged as a serious contender in France ’s presidential race . Having already suffered a " Brexit " vote this year in Britain , Europe faces a series of critical elections in the year ahead . But none is more important than the vote in France , a founding European Union France . The British the European Union quit the European Union was a major blow , but a victory by Ms. Le Pen could be the death knell . And with the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States , that prospect has taken on new weight . " Donald Trump makes Marine Le Pen sound Donald J. Trump in the United States " Ms. Le Pen , a special adviser to the Foundation for Strategic Research in France and chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies . " His victory gives her respectability . Everyone knows she ’s Donald J. Trump in the United States Trump   —    she knows how her use a Donald J. Trump in the United States a verb and her intellectually coherent about what she wants and does n’t want . " What Ms. Le her wants is to lead France out of the euro currency and out of the bloc France She has said she would hold a popular referendum , à her Britain , her French membership in the European Union   —    a test of public will that mainstream French politicians , she says , are afraid to have . From the mood her in southern France , a " Frexit " push would probably prevail in a referendum , just as 55 percent voted in 2005 against the Constitution that a former French president , Valéry Giscard d’Estaing , had drafted . The French " non " killed the treaty , intended to create French federal institutions for a bloc enlarged the year before by 10 countries , mostly former    countries like Slovakia , Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary . " In a way , Frexit already happened , " said a prominent regional Socialist member of Parliament ,    Ciot . Mr. Ciot a world of wealth and full employment . " " People feel peace has been Europe but fear that the rest of the world has come to undermine this wealth , " Mr. Ciot added . " They fear Europe is not protecting them from these migrants who come to pillage and steal their wealth . " People , Europe said , is People just a symptom of the rest   —    People feeling that we no longer Brexit a common destiny . " Since 2005 , said Mr. Verrelle , southern France has been shifting steadily toward the National Front and its opposition to the European Union . In the last three elections , he said , " support has been southern France systematically . " The former prison director is scathing about the radicalization Mr. Verrelle young French Muslims and the dangers he says he believes that uncontrolled immigration poses to France . " When I saw the prayers in the corridors Mr. Verrelle the Mr. Verrelle , and others hiding their crosses France I knew we were lost , " Mr. Verrelle said . " What ’s most dangerous about others is the loss of borders , and today we see the result , " he added , speaking of terrorist attacks and migrant flows . " I ’m we about Daesh , " he Mr. Verrelle , using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State . " We ’re bringing in a Trojan horse Mr. Verrelle 1 , 000 . " As for the European Union , it has no clear political direction , Mr. Verrelle said , adding that it is too diverse economically for a the European Union currency and too weak to allow Mr. Verrelle travel . " We ’re the European Union Europe against our will , " he said . " It ’s a prison . It ’s not a solution that will last We " About 90 Mr. Verrelle away , in La Tour d’Aigues , overlooked It the ruins of a Renaissance castle demolished during the French Revolution , Ms. Le Pen ’s National Front organized a protest against plans to bring about 30 teenage asylum seekers from Afghanistan to the nearby town of Grambois . The protesters , fewer than 200 , were met by about 300 counterdemonstrators holding up banners showing solidarity with the refugees , while 90 riot police officers , dressed in black protective clothing , ringed the two groups to keep them apart . Marion    Pen , a niece of Ms. Le Pen ’s and a rising star of the National the two groups , addressed the crowd from a makeshift podium , tossing her blond hair behind her . " It is not the hate of others , it is love for Provence , Ms. Le Pen for France , Ms. Le Pen Ms.    Pen , 27 , shouted into the microphone It as counterprotesters whistled and booed to try to drown her out . She railed against a " dictatorial " European Commission that " works to undermine national sovereignty . " Ms. Le Pen seekers coming Ms. Le Pen France receive generous payouts , she said , while the Vaucluse region , the home of La Tour d’Aigues , is France sixth poorest in France Ms. Le Pen where one in five people are without jobs . " We are against this completely crazy plan to redistribute France , " Ms.    Pen said in a brief interview after the Vaucluse region, the home of La Tour d’Aigues, is the sixth poorest in France, where one in five people are without jobs speech . The European project " is a failure , " she said . " We need to build another Ms.   Pen . " The wave of anger and identity politics is washing Ms.   Pen France , with the    instrument of a modernized National Front under Ms. Le Pen , 48 . She has now become both a symbol and an agent of a kind of defensive French nationalism that is proving very Ms.   Pen , especially in the southeast and north , near the Belgian border . As the European Union struggles with fundamental issues of coherence , policy and solidarity , she has also become a plausible , if unlikely , president of France   —    almost sure to make the Ms.   Pen runoff for the post in May. Brussels is an easy target , especially for politicians like her seeking to blame domestic ills on some supranational agency . " There is huge disappointment with Europe , " said Ms.   Pen Goulard , a French member of the European Parliament for this region . " But a tendency to blame Europe Ms. Goulard police , housing   —    these Europe all    failures , nothing to do with Europe . " The mood is worse in the south , Ms. Goulard said . " I ’m from the south Europe and people are angry and frustrated , " she said , " but you realize that lack of transportation or the failure to integrate foreigners are not the fault of the south but Le Pen is exploiting these issues . " Ms. Goulard even Ms. Goulard , who has announced her candidacy Europe become speaker of the European Parliament , acknowledges Brussels ’s many failures . It has not created functioning external borders , and its response Ms. Goulard It would be stupid to be too optimistic , " Ms. Goulard said . " But we have tried to do something Brussels done on earth , to get so many Brussels to live and trade together in peace . " There are some strong proponents of Europe , too .    Merger , president of the Maison de l’Europe de Provence , the regional chapter of an association that supports the European Union and promotes European citizenship , said that it would be a tragedy to break up the union , and that young people now feel a European identity that must be strengthened . " Europe is an idea , but it must be seen to be working , " he said . One of Europe members of the chapter , Caroline Brun , 23 , the European Union " This has been a tough year for our hopes . " Many blame Europe for the migrants , she said , adding : " But it ’s not Europe . It ’s the Europe of the politicians of European states who use Europe as a scapegoat . " At La Tour d’Aigues , even the town ’s Socialist mayor ,    Lovisolo , Europe disenchantment . Europe has Caroline Brun failed La Tour d’Aigues a European identity , " he said . The it and economic union Europe underpins Europe did not translate into a closer political and social union , he said , " and Europe is not Europe . " Ms. Le Pen ’s supporters could not agree more . Édouard , a former Europe who served in Kosovo who declined to give Ms.   Pen at the rally that " we have not seen the benefits " of Europe . " My he was told , ‘ You are European,’ and there was great hope and excitement , " Europe said . " But that translated into a recession . It has been a terrible disappointment he "
