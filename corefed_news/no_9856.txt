Alan Dershowitz writes at the Jerusalem Post :   The Egyptian decision to withdraw the      Security Council resolution should not mask the sad reality that The Egyptian decision to withdraw the     Security Council resolution is the Obama administration that has been pushing for the resolution to be enacted . The United States was trying to hide The United States active ‘ behind the scenes’ roll by preparing to abstain rather than voting for the resolution . But in the context of the Security Council where only an American veto can prevent    resolutions from automatically passing , an abstention is a vote for the the resolution because of this automatic majority , an    resolution like this one can not be reversed by a future President Obama’s veto once cast can not be cast retroactively . The effect , therefore of the Obama decision to push for , and abstain from , a vote on this resolution the resolution deliberately tie the hands of President Obama ’s successors , most particularly    Donald Trump . That is why Trump did the right thing in   Donald Trump to Obama ’s provocation . Had the Obama duck president not tried President Obama’s president ’s hands , Trump would not have intervened at this time .   Donald Trump if he had not urged the Egyptians to withdraw the   Donald Trump , he would have made it far more difficult for   Donald Trump to try to bring about a negotiated resolution   Donald Trump the    conflict .
