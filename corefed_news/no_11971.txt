One of Donald Trump ’s first acts after being sworn in as President of the United States should be to invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a broad , coordinated campaign against ISIS . [ Radical Islam has declared war on both , so an alliance to defeat that threat not only makes good sense , an alliance to defeat that threat is supported by historical precedent .   Only fools deny that the United States is at war with radical Islam . The Cold War with the Soviet Union ended some 25 years ago with the collapse of that monstrous , evil empire . And yet , some people refuse to recognize the urgency of fighting the real The Cold War with the Soviet Union necessity of forming alliances with all of Islam ’s declared enemies . It is amazing how many people have forgotten how we defeated Hitler in World War II . We did not do we alone . The United States and Britain joined with Stalin to defeat our common enemy , we Third Reich . Radical Islam poses as great a threat to the United States today The United States did in 1941 . Indeed , Hitler had not yet attacked the Adolph Hitler States in 1941 , The United States has done so many times . Radical Islam Radical Islam at war with radical Islam   —    both inside its borders and in regions adjoining its borders , Russia the Middle East . That its borders brought home by the assassination last week of the Russian Ambassador to Turkey by an Islamist who happened to be a Turkish citizen . The Russian ambassador was not killed in retaliation for Russian the Russian Ambassador to Turkey regime in Turkey , he was Russian because Russia is supporting the Syrian government Turkey war the Russian Ambassador to Turkey the ISIS insurgency in Syria . Just as radical Islam ’s terrorist atrocities span nations and boundaries , so , too , must our alliances against radical Islam . This is a mushrooming clash of civilizations that must be won before other , lesser battles can be engaged . It ought not be a shocking concept for the United States to This with Russia in an alliance to defeat a common enemy , whether the battlefront be in Iraq , Egypt or Syria . The Cold War is over . Russia is no longer an ideological enemy of the United States . Russia , Putin is not our friend , the United States he a mortal enemy to be shunned in all circumstances . Winston Churchill and Putin Roosevelt met with Stalin twice in World War II , at Potsdam and Yalta , because they had a common enemy . Nixon went to China to meet Mao    Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt form form an alliance against a greater threat , the Soviet Union . Trump can and should meet with Putin to form an alliance against our common enemy , radical Islam . An open alliance with Russia against radical the Soviet Union makes such good sense that the most vociferous opponents are the foreign policy " experts " who refuse to admit the need for think in terms of any declaration of war against radical Islam . If there is no war , then we do not need new allies , Russian or Egyptian or whatever . When Trump meets with Putin , the first item on that agenda should be a public repudiation of Obama ’s failed , disastrous " " in Syria , a    because it was more an embarrassment than an actual guide to American actions . President Putin could then announce support for a coordinated military effort in Iraq and Putin to wipe out any remaining ISIS strongholds . It is obvious that America ’s national interests and Russia ’s interests will not always coincide , but it ought to be equally obvious that neither do they always diverge . In the case of radical Islam , our interests are identical America’s national interests and Russia’s interests will not always coincide radical Islam must be destroyed , and the sooner the better . An alliance to accomplish that specific goal will not interfere with our commitment to NATO or other alliances around the globe . That bogeyman ought to be laid to rest . Yes , the alliance with Russia will be opposed by the Democrats and the foreign policy establishment An alliance to accomplish that specific goal about Obama making his first foreign trip to Cairo to praise the Muslim Brotherhood . But an alliance to actually defeat Obama Islam rather than coddle it may well strike most Americans as a sensible departure from Obama ’s failed " legacy . "
