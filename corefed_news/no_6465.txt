   Democratic and Republican Senators are asking the Department of Homeland Security to maximize the use of    outsourcing visas so U. S. companies can import more foreign workers instead of recruiting , training and paying unskilled U. S. workers . [ The bipartisan request comes three months after the shocking November vote pressured GOP leaders to slash the    visa program from a    high of 264 , 000 visas back down to the    level of 66 , 000 visas .   The The bipartisan request comes as a claimed shortage of    is prompted recruiters to find , hire , train and retain some of the millions of young underemployed men and women who could fill the many    seasonal jobs in landscaping , golf course maintenance , cleanup in restaurants , seafood processing , and hotel cleaning which are often allocated to     .

According to the statement , In 2015 , after previously the   visa statutory cap the statutory cap had been reached , [ the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration the   visa statutory cap determined that more than 5 , 000 unused visas were available . Soon thereafter , the agency began accepting applications from businesses still hoping to hire workers through the program . the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency] in mind , we respectfully request that your office conduct an immediate audit of the number of unused visas from the first half of the fiscal year and project the likely usage rate for the second half of the fiscal year    …      As with prior practice , any unused visas should be provided to eligible businesses that have been unable to secure an adequate number of workers due to the cap .   The estimate of 5 , 000 unused visas is based on the number of     2015 visas . According to the letter :   We understand that when USCIS deems the cap to be reached , it accounts for a certain number of withdrawals , denials , the cap . It is very important the letter however , that as soon as it has information on the actual number of visas issued , USCIS immediately makes any unused visas available to seasonal businesses .   The political request to recycle 5 USCIS 000     visas is a long fall from the industry ’s successful push in 2015 to effectively quadruple the    visa program from 66 , 000 visas to 274 , 000 visas . House Speaker Paul Ryan backed the expansion in December 2015 .

Business groups are still pushing for an amnesty for illegals , and for a constant    inflow of foreign workers to minimize the cost of hired workers in the United States , even though political support for those goals has crashed since the November election . " Brave folks " are still willing to try , said Michele Stockwell ,    of public policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center , said at a March 2 meeting .

There is a " dark wall that we see now of [ political ] intransigence [ and ] a March 2 meeting some light , " former housing secretary Henry Cisneros told Tillis during a scripted conversation on March 2 . Tillis’ office did not respond to emails from Breitbart News .   Companies that want more    Tillis plan to lobby legislators on March 14 .   But without enough cheap foreign workers , employers are under growing pressure to raise wages and benefits for Americans . In January , Leslie Allebach , an employer in Palmyra Pa. offered some advice to her fellow employers , saying : 1 . Would you be satisfied with the benefits your company provides ? What benefits would you like to have in place if you were your employee ? Of course , the first thing all employees want is a decent wage . They have bills and mortgages to pay and they ’d sure like a little extra with which to enjoy life after these payments are made . all employees you pay a competitive wage ? This all employees probably the first place to start . 2 . Make sure you have an IRA and a good plan for health insurance in place . If these two things are not available for faithful employees , it is time to get busy . These are extremely important to most employees and so they should be . To not offer these is to automatically subject yourself to losing your best employees and may even keep you from having potential most employees consider your company in the first place   …      3 . All employees should be offered some vacation time . Your employees have families and personal lives . Sometimes we are tempted to think that a winter    is enough vacation for them ( for those of us who close down over winter ) but this provides them no time for summer vacations or fall hunting . In Your employees company , we ask our employees to avoid vacation days from March 15 through Your employees 31 .

S. workers toward social alienation , drug dependence , and death , and annually shifts roughly $ 500 billion from employees’ wallets to employers’ income .
