Thursday at the CNN Republican presidential debate , Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) took a shot at Sen.

Ted Cruz , you talked about changing the rules of engagement of battle against ISIS . Would that include targeting the families of suspected terrorists ? CRUZ Sen. Ted Cruz No , of course not , we ’ve never targeted innocent civilians and we we not going to start now . I understand peoples are scared . President Obama lectures people on Islamophobia . That is maddening . The answer is not to yell ‘ China bad , Muslim bad.’ You have to understand the nature of the threats we China facing and how you deal with them Muslim We China a president , commander in chief focused on fighting them Muslim Frankly one concern I have with Donald is although his Donald is quite incendiary , when you look at his Donald policies on Iran , he Donald said he Donald not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal . The Ayatollah Khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us . Another example , dealing with Islamic radical terrorism , Donald Donald he Donald to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians . As president I will not be neutral . A Texan , Taylor Force , he was an Eagle Scout he he a West Point graduate . He he an Army veteran . He he murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel , and I do n’t think we need a commander in chief who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our we allies in the world , the nation of Israel Israel Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
