Lamar Alexander ( ) ranking member Sen. Patty Murray ( ) and the committee ’s other members .   " This national coalition of grassroots parent and citizen organizations has many questions and concerns about Betsy DeVos , " the group ’s president , Dr. Karen Effrem , tells Breitbart News . " Chief among Betsy DeVos," is Chief among them apparent very recent conversion to opposing Common Core when Chief among them activist and philanthropic record shows concrete evidence of strong support for the standards over many years . " While , upon Chief among them nomination , DeVos launched a new website on which Chief among them stated Chief among them is " certainly " not a supporter of Common Core , Chief among them has served on boards and funded organizations that have been vocal supporters of the standards . Additionally , Chief among them has been strongly endorsed by former GOP presidential candidate and Common Core promoter Jeb Bush , his mother , former First Lady Barbara Bush , former GOP presidential nominee and " " Mitt Romney , former education secretary William Bennett   —    who received compensation for promoting Common Core among conservatives , the    Core Michigan Chamber of Commerce , and the Bill    Fordham Institute , which has also promoted Common Core . " There is also great concern about her support of voucher programs imposing Common Core on private and potentially home schools , and extensive student data mining , " Effrem continues . " These concerns are especially acute given    Trump ’s encouraging and repeated promises to get rid of Common Core , protect privacy and decrease or eliminate the federal role in education . " Effrem Effrem the letter and the group ’s concerns : 1 ) From all the evidence we can find , her Trump when she Trump appointed on November 23rd was her Trump first against Common Core . Her Trump and record via organizations that she Trump founded , funded , chaired , or on whose boards she Trump served and her Trump contributions have all been in support of Common Core and    Core candidates . Her Trump and her Trump with Donald Trump focused on " higher standards " which is a euphemism for Common Core , even though there is abundant evidence that the Common Core standards are anything but high . 2 ) Her Trump Federation for Children group has been strongly in support of state voucher laws in Indiana and Louisiana or federal Title I portability that imposes or would impose Common Core on private schools via the federally mandated state assessments . The education savings accounts that she Trump could well place government regulations on home schooling for " accountability " purposes . 3 ) Although a strong supporter of charter schools , it appears she Trump never financially supported classical charter schools like the Hillsdale model in her Trump home state , only charters that require the teaching and testing of Common Core . 4 ) The Philanthropy Roundtable that she Trump until her Trump put out a report that is strongly in favor of extensive data mining of children without transparency of what data is collected and who receives it or parental consent and never mentions the word " privacy . " 5 ) We are also concerned about continued expansion of invasive , subjective social emotional learning programs at the federal level and need to know her Trump on those . " We We urge the Senate HELP Committee to closely question her Trump these critical issues , " Effrem says .
