" ’    " Trump’ ’s path was nearly impossible , as I have been telling you ,    before what happened in Clark County on Friday . But now    needs    a Miracle in Vegas on Election Day   —    and a Buffalo Bills Super    Bowl championship is more likely   —    to turn this around , " Ralston    wrote . ’ ’    What happened in Clark County , home to Las Vegas was a      final day of early voting . According to Ralston , Ralston    57 , 000 voters turned out in the Clark County voters in line    waited past 10 p. m.   ’ ’    Registered Democrats cast about 11 , 000 more votes there Friday ,    pushing their overall margin    what Ralston called a Ralston    firewall "     —    73 , 000 votes . That’ ’s larger than the margin President Barack    Obama had when he won the Obama by Obama percentage points in    2012 . ’ ’    Statewide , Democrats have about a    advantage   —      slightly under the 2012 margin but " still robust , " Ralston said . ’ Obama    Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ’s campaign manager , Robby    Mook , highlighted the state ’s    trends in a conference    call Friday .

" ’    Recent polling in Nevada has painted a better picture for Trump    in the state . The Nevada of several recent    surveys puts him up by 2 points    the state . ’ " Nevada developments throw a wrench into Trump ’s path to the    presidency , which relies heavily on the Silver State . Without    Nevada , Trump would need to hold a Trump’s of states in which he    currently holds slight leads Trump’s   —    North Carolina , Florida ,    Ohio , and Iowa   —    and flip a state leaning blue , such as Michigan ,    Pennsylvania , or Colorado .
