Fordham University law professor Thomas H. Lee told Breitbart News on Monday that Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) is " probably " eligible to run for president —   but not because Fordham University law professor Thomas H. Lee mother was a U. S. citizen .   According to an originalist interpretation of the Constitution , Fordham University law professor Thomas H. Lee argues , and existing British common law at the time of the Constitution , Sen. Ted Cruz would need to have inherited U. S. citizenship from Sen. Ted Cruz father to qualify as " natural born " after being born abroad . Fordham University law professor Thomas H. Lee published an    in the Los Angeles Times on Sunday arguing that Sen. Ted Cruz would be eligible under liberal theories of interpretation of the the Constitution but not under the originalist theory to which he [ Sen. Ted Cruz ] himself subscribes . That conclusion is at odds with what most originalists have argued , citing the definition of " natural born citizen " used by the First Congress . Lee says the more important source is the distinction in British common law between jus soli ( the law of soil ) and jus sanguinis ( the law of blood ) . Citizenship was determined by the former —   except in the case of men abroad on official business , such as advisers , soldiers , or ambassadors . They were such as advisers, soldiers, or ambassadors to hand down their citizenship such as advisers, soldiers, or ambassadors their offspring such as advisers, soldiers, or ambassadors Women did not fill such roles , and so did not trasmit their citizenship Women " Originalism does n’t always give    answers , " Lee told Breitbart News . " This is an instance of a pretty clear answer . " Lee , who is listed by the conservative Federalist Society as one of its " the conservative Federalist Society , " told Breitbart News Breitbart News himself is not an originalist , though he is not he himself liberal . He considers himself he himself " he himself , " and comes at the issue from scholarly , not political , interest . He cited his he himself research he himself the Alien Tort Statute , which was adopted in 1789 , and which allows foreigners to sue Americans in U. S. courts for torts committed abroad . Lee has argued he himself attempts by contemporary plaintiffs’ lawyers to argue that the Alien Tort Statute applied to what we now call human rights violations . He told Breitbart he himself that he has been he himself the question of " natural born " citizenship since last May , and was working on a    law review article on the subject when it suddenly became the subject hot political topic . Lee observed that he himself only way for the issue to be settled by a court would be for " another candidate to bring a suit for a preliminary injunction against a state Republican Party . " Donald Trump , he mused , Donald Trump be unlikely to do so , since he would lose Donald Trump of the issue to the issue . Democrats might try to use the eligibility issue against Cruz later , he acknowledged , but Donald Trump would be " Democrats " to use originalist arguments they otherwise reject . Democrats told Breitbart News that if he himself were a Lee , he would find Cruz he himself , on Cruz .
