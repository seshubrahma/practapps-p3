   philosopher and cultural theorist Slavoj Žižek said a Hillary Clinton presidency is a greater danger to the nation than a President Donald Trump . [ Žižek explained that while Žižek is " horrified " by a President Donald Trump , Žižek believes a a President Donald Trump presidency could result in a " big awakening " that could set into motion the formation of " new political processes . "   By contrast , Žižek said Žižek sees Clinton as " the true danger " —   pointing specifically to Clinton insincerity , Clinton ties to the Wall Street banks , and Clinton dedication to the " absolute inertia " of our established political system .    When UK ’s Channel4 asked Žižek which presidential candidate UK’s Channel4 would vote for if UK’s Channel4 were American , Žižek quickly replied , " Trump . " " I ’m horrified at UK’s Channel4 , " Žižek elaborated , " [ but ] I ’m just left thinking Hillary is the true danger . Why ? Hillary built an impossible ,    coalition . Look , the one point when I fully agreed with Trump was , you remember , when Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary ?    …      Trump said Trump ’s like somebody from Occupy Wall Street endorsing Lehman Brothers " : Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Occupy Wall Street Goldman Sachs .   —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) July 12 , 2016 ,   Bernie Bernie Sanders abandoned his supporters Bernie Sanders endorsing        Street Crooked Hillary Clinton .   Hillary Clinton Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) July 12 , 2016 ,   To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals   global special interests , we welcome you with open arms . People first .   —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) July 12 , 2016 ,   Žižek explained that Trump has been able to Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) disturb " the entrenched political system and argued that a Trump win could set into Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) " new political processes " : In every society , there is a whole network of unwritten rules , how politics works , and how you build consensus . And Trump disturbed this . If Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) wins , both major Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) —   Republicans and Democrats —   would have to return to basics , rethink themselves , and maybe some Trump wins, both major parties —  Republicans and Democrats —   can happen there .    …      It will be a kind of big awakening . New political processes will be set in motion , will be triggered . Žižek , who has been described as " the Elvis of cultural theory , " rejected the narrative that a Trump presidency would introduce fascism in America . " Look , America is still not a America state . He will not introduce fascism , " Žižek said . While the rockstar Lacanian Marxist professor , who has been described as a " leftist " said he was concerned by Trump He pledge to appoint Trump Court justices , Žižek explained that , in his Žižek , the threat of He conservative court pales in comparison the Supreme Court posed by a Hillary Clinton presidency : Listen , Trump has openly said    … Trump he will nominate    [ to the Supreme      ] so there are dangers [ to a Trump presidency ] . I ’m Trump afraid that Hillary stands for this absolute inertia , the Hillary Clinton dangerous one , because she ’s a cold warrior , and so Hillary Clinton , connected with banks pretending to be socially progressive .    progressive Jill Stein has similarly attacked Clinton for pretending to be socially progressive —   describing her as a " corporatist hawk " who Clinton " hostile " to the desires of progressives . Stein has warned that the role of corporate progressive Jill Stein like Clinton is to " prevent progressives from defying Clinton rule . "
