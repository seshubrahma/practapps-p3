President Trump is lashing out against " fake news " in what is quite possibly the greatest    course ever publicly taught in America . [ Also , there is President Trump relentless interaction with the press . And I do n’t just mean the big guys . I mean the little local guys from Poughkeepsie , piped into the White House briefing room for awkward questions asked by disemboweled local anchors .   At the end of the day , Mr. Trump President Trump not done . So he turns to President Trump to unleash yet more unfiltered news awesomeness onto the American media landscape . Welcome to the Age of Raw Journalism . Truly , a new dawn in American media . Drink fully from it , for Truly, a new dawn in American media flowing bounty has never been like this ever before , and who knows if and when it will ever Truly, a new dawn in American media . It is the confluence of instant information , manic technologies and a political figure who has the strength , fearlessness and stamina to keep it going around the clock . So let ’s check in it the professionals , the folks who stand to benefit the most from this most generous newsmaker . " This is how the muzzling starts , " New York Times media drip Jim Rutenberg warned ominously , " not with a boot on your neck , but with the fear of one that runs so deep that you muzzle yourself . " Not sure exactly what that means , but I checked twice to make sure I copied it correctly . " Maybe it ’s the it you decide against doing because it ’s liable it provoke a    president to put the power of his office behind a   president attempt to a   president your reputation by falsely calling your journalism ‘ fake.’ " Maybe it ’s the line you hold back from your script or your article because it could trigger your article federal leak investigation into you and your sources ( so , yeah , jail ) . " All of that is from an actual report by Mr. Rutenberg in the    newspaper that is now , according to the president , " failing . " Everywhere you turn today , reporters are gasping that the First Amendment is somehow under assault by Mr. Trump . White House reporters say they are under White House reporters during daily briefings with Sean Spicer insulting them , rudely White House reporters questions and assaulting them with the White House reporters White House podium White House , that last one I made up , but it was from the first funny skit " Saturday Night Live " has come up with in decades . But let ’s seriously consider how Mr. Trump is Mr. Trump press . He gave a      Mr. Trump briefing in the White House last Thursday . He walked in and Mr. Trump by " mentioning " the name of his new nominee for Mr. Trump secretary . And then he turned the whole Mr. Trump over to reporters . All modern presidents have opened such briefings with a list of handpicked reporters they would call on to All modern presidents they only got the type All modern presidents questions they wanted . Nobody in All modern presidents doormat press corps ever complains about that . Donald Trump threw the gates wide open . If he walked in with a Donald Trump , he tossed it aside by Donald Trump time he walked in with a list got going . He Donald Trump up there pointing Donald Trump random reporters and pitting them against one another , random reporters times barking like a tobacco auctioneer . He took any and all Donald Trump . He was tough , he Donald Trump funny , he Donald Trump belligerent . But Donald Trump was always engaging . Donald Trump Trump ’s immediate predecessor was famous for taking eight questions and bloviating at length and droning on long enough on each question that he would stretch it out Mr. Trump 50 minutes . He never wavered , of Mr. Trump , from his list of approved questioners Mr. Trump In Mr. Trump ’s freewheeling press Mr. Trump answered questions from two dozen reporters Mr. Trump more than 40 questions total if you include   . And the entire thing was riveting and revealing and supremely watchable . How is this an affront to the First Amendment ? Katy Tur , another journalistic lion over Ms. Tur Congress . " As we know , there ’s since 2000 been a couple dozen suspicious deaths of journalists in Russia who came out against the government there , " Ms. Tur said . " Donald Trump has made no secret about going after journalists and his distaste for any news that does n’t agree with him here . Do you find that this Donald Trump a dangerous path he is heading down ? " Donald Trump Donald Trump likes to mix it up with reporters and challenge Donald Trump ? So next step is he Donald Trump to start killing them this is a dangerous path he is heading down OK , I am not in the least bit concerned about Donald Trump First Amendment in America with them Trump in the White House .
