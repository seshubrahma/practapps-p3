"    instead pointed Business    Insider to      ’ " An unverified    dossier about Trump ’s ties to Russia , written by former    British spy Christopher Steele at the request of      Republicans , named Page as a liaison between the Trump’s    campaign and Russian officials . " "    US intelligence officials briefed Trump    on the dossier ’s contents    in early January , and the FBI   to continue his    investigation after Republicans   —    and , later , Democrats   —    stopped    funding Steele ’s research .

" The clear evidence of intolerance against    Catholics shown by the ’’ Hillary for America ’’ campaign and the    fact that several of her closest advisors knew of my religion    helps to make part of the reason for her attacks more obvious .
