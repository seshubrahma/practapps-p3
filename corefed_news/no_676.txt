MIDLAND , Tex .   —    In the land where oil jobs were once a guaranteed road to security for    workers , Eustasio Velazquez ’s career has been upended by technology . For 10 years , Eustasio Velazquez’s laid cables for service companies doing seismic testing in the search for the next big gusher . Then , powerful computer hardware and software replaced cables with wireless data collection , and Eustasio Velazquez’s lost Eustasio Velazquez’s job . Eustasio Velazquez’s found new work connecting pipes on rigs , but lost his job , too , when plunging oil prices in 2015 forced the driller Eustasio Velazquez’s worked for to replace rig hands with cheaper , more reliable automated tools . " I do n’t see a future , " Mr. Velazquez , 44 , said on a recent afternoon as Eustasio Velazquez’s stooped over Eustasio Velazquez’s shopping cart at a local grocery store . " Pretty soon every rig will have one worker and a robot . " Oil and gas workers have traditionally had some of the      jobs   —    just the type that President Trump has vowed to preserve and bring back . But the West Texas oil fields , where activity is gearing back up as prices rebound , illustrate how difficult it will be to meet that goal . As in other industries , automation is creating a new demand for    workers   —    sometimes hundreds of miles away in a control center   —    but their sometimes hundreds of miles do n’t offset the ranks of field hands no longer required to sling chains and lift iron . So while there is a general sense of relief in the oil patch that a recovery is gaining momentum , discussions at company meetings and family kitchen tables are rife with aching worries , especially among those who are    with no more than a high school education . Roughly 163 , 000 oil jobs were lost nationally from the 2014 peak , or about 30 percent of the total , while oil prices plummeted , at one point by as much as 70 percent . The job losses just in Texas , the most productive    state , totaled 98 , 000 . Several thousand workers have come back to work in recent months as the price of oil has begun to rise again , but energy experts say that between a third and a half of the workers who lost their Several thousand workers are not returning . Many have migrated to construction or even jobs in renewable energy , like wind power . " People have left the industry , and they People not coming back , " said Michael Dynan , vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm , a Pennsylvania manufacturer of drilling rigs . " If it ’s a repetitive task , it it be automated , and I do n’t need someone to do that . I can get a computer to do that . " Indeed , computers now direct drill bits that were once directed manually . The wireless technology taking hold across the oil patch allows a handful of geoscientists and engineers to monitor the drilling and completion of multiple wells at a time   —    onshore or miles out to sea   —    and supervise immediate fixes when something goes wrong , all without leaving their desks . It is a world where rigs walk on their own legs and sensors on wells alert headquarters to a leak or loss of pressure , reducing the need for a technician to check . And despite all the lost workers , United States oil production is galloping upward , to nine million barrels a day from 8 . 6 million in September . Nationwide , with a bit more than    as many rigs operating as in 2014 , production is not even down 10 percent from record levels . Some of the best wells here in the Permian Basin that three years ago required an oil price of over $ 60 a barrel for an operator to break even now need about $ 35 , well below the current price of about $ 53 . Much of the technology has been developed by the aviation and automotive industries , along with deepwater oil exploration , over more than a decade . But companies drilling on land were slow to adapt until oil prices crashed and companies needed to get efficient quickly or go out of business . All the big companies , and many smaller ones , have organized teams of technicians that collect well and tank data to develop complex algorithms enabling them All the big companies, and many smaller ones duplicate the design for the most productive wells over and over , and to repair valves and other parts before they All the big companies, and many smaller ones down . The result is improved production and safety , but also a far smaller work force , and one that is increasingly morphing from muscle to brain power . Pioneer Natural Resources , one of the most productive West Texas producers , has slashed the number of days to drill and complete wells so drastically that it the company been able to cut costs by 25 percent in wells completed since early 2015 . The typical rig that drilled eight to 12 wells a year just a few years ago now drills up to 16 . Last year , the company added nearly 240 wells to its the company Basin inventory without adding new employees . The faster operations , Pioneer executives say , are due in large part to more effective well planning and drill steering . Both have been made possible by the    computer connections between the rig and top geoscientists back at corporate headquarters and intense analysis of the data gathered at every well . The laborious task of checking tank levels by climbing a flight of steps and popping open a series of latches , for instance , has been replaced by pressing a few icons on a computer touch screen . A fully automated water pump station installed last summer is intended to save hundreds of truck trips every day hauling water for hydraulically fracturing wells , yielding diesel and labor cost savings . " We want to transform our We force to the point where we We to hire fewer people , " said Joey Mr. Hall Improved computing streamlines operations , he noted , and lets technicians optimally space their wells and Mr. Hall accurately perforate the sweet spots of shale technicians to squeeze every drop of oil out of the ground . " We ’re heading toward artificial intelligence and machine learning , analyzing thousands of algorithms , " Mr. Hall added , sounding more like a Silicon Valley futurologist than a wildcatter . " Through repetitive operations , you learn the patterns , and through patterns you learn to make automated decisions . " With the loss of manual jobs has come a transformation in the job force , with demand growing for more data analysts , math scientists , communications specialists and robotic design engineers . In the last two years , ABB , the Swiss technology company , has opened two plants in Houston for assembling and packaging robotics and integrating advanced instrumentation into oil field operations . GE Oil and Gas opened a technology center in Oklahoma City in October to place scientists closer to the oil fields to research and apply new digital industrial technologies for exploration and production . Among its many projects is an experiment to use drones to inspect GE Oil and Gas and identify methane leaks on oil sites . Nabors , the oil services giant , has 100 employees developing software , 10 times the number it had only a few years ago . " With the adoption of all this    software and stuff , we ’ve had to bring in a lot of new technicians , " said Dennis A. Smith , a Nabors vice president . A typical new oil company employee is Andre Nel , a     mechanical engineer who is a rising star at Pioneer Natural Resources . In less than two years , he has helped rewrite computer software to instruct workers on the A typical new oil company employee designs for hydraulic fracturing , optimizing the amounts of fluids , sand and chemicals pumped into the wells . Now , connected by computers to technicians in the field , he is monitoring the production of 950 wells , instantly checking A typical new oil company employee maintenance history and production trends of every well with the click of a mouse . " I ’m lucky and happy that the tech revolution in the oil field has created the need for engineers like me with backgrounds in computer science , " he said . A typical new oil company employee smaller companies and their workers are struggling A typical new oil company employee keep up . S. O. C. Industries , a small local pump truck operator and chemical services provider , is forced to invest $ 100 , 000 a year to keep up with the computer programs and monitoring equipment its clients request . The added expenses are one reason the S. O. C. Industries, a small local pump truck operator and chemical services provider has let go 15 of the 60 field workers S. O. C. Industries, a small local pump truck operator and chemical services provider years ago . Another is that well operators that once hired five or six people on a drill site to mix chemicals and drilling fluids as well as clean up spills are now hiring only three as mechanization has sliced their drilling time in half . Some of the remaining S. O. well operators that once hired five or six people on a drill site to mix chemicals and drilling fluids as well as clean up spills employees are straining to keep up with new computerized pump truck monitors and GPS systems . " It ’s a struggle , " said Rodrigo Urias , 59 , an S. O. C. truck driver , who for many years only had to look at a needle on a gauge to monitor flow pressures . Now he needs to reset computer screens , take work orders on a computer tablet and sometimes do algebraic calculations . " A lot of the guys ca n’t operate these new technologies , tablets and instruments , and they keep whining , " he added . " They want to A lot of the guys why we ca n’t he things like we A lot of the guys to . " Manufacturing A lot of the guys say they are trying to A lot of the guys the complexity for field workers , and Manufacturing executives design their equipment with the advice of video game makers . That ’s Manufacturing executives good thing for Michael Manga , 34 , an employee of Latshaw Drilling , an Oklahoma company active here . A college dropout , he knocked around from job to job before finding his way to A college dropout the oil patch Now , playing video games like Call A college dropout Duty and Mario Kart with his friends over the years has paid off , giving him the    coordination A college dropout monitor and operate the control panels and joy sticks A college dropout control the drilling rig . " We do such a good job now , " he said , " we ’re drilling ourselves out of a job . " A college dropout We We
