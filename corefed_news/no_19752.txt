" John Berger ’s Rare Art CriticismElisa Wouk Almino | Hyperallergic"Berger ’s art criticism succeeds , I think , because of its art criticism —   it art criticism grounded in human experience , specific historical events , and always the physical marks on the artworks .

He Rumi fictions that are both translatable and embody translation in their both and methods . His Rumi moves between languages and cultures ( and , perhaps particularly , into and out of English ) with relative ease and fluidity , with few textual and stylistic impediments or difficult cultural contexts , but , rather , various mechanisms and textual markers that seem to invite and insist on translation as both theme and practice . " Anxiety and A Series of Unfortunate Events Scaachi Koul | Buzzfeed"The orphans in Unfortunate Events , though they had each other , had lost both of their they and were largely left on their they . There was never a reason for them they be hopeful , or to expect anything good , because nothing good came . It was n’t a cheerful way to live , but at least they they prepared . And I wanted to be prepared for what is , still , inevitable : that people die , and that you will , at some point , be left to fend for yourself that no one is responsible for you yourself and people will fail you at every turn . Everyone becomes an orphan at some point . At least by reading , I could find a way to feel less alone in my fears . " Hidden Figures and the Power of PragmatismThe Undefeated | Soraya Nadia McDonald"Besides communicating about the power of common interests , Hidden Figures demonstrates why sneering dismissively at ‘ identity politics’ or using the term as a pejorative amounts to little more than hogwash .

That ’s because the newness of Penelope and her world Penelope nestled within the tradition of the           comedy , as well as within the more specific Norman Lear tradition of creating major characters that represent distinct political viewpoints without denying their humanity distinct political viewpoints then pitting them against distinct political viewpoints other in verbal combat without giving up on the idealistic notion that there ’s common ground to be found somewhere if you look hard enough . " Kate Beckinsale Is a Legit Movie StarK. Austin Collins | The Ringer"Beckinsale ’s best roles emphasize this lack of likability . Her peculiar Kate Beckinsale is an uncanny ability to seem like she ’s Kate Beckinsale surface , no depth . At least , that ’s what we ’ve seen when certain directors let her take Kate Beckinsale idea and run with it . that idea the miracle of her collaboration Kate Beckinsale Stillman , whose The Last Days of Disco ( 1998 ) gave Beckinsale her first Beckinsale great role , and whose more recent Love   Friendship is a comparably rich , virtuosic turn almost 20 years later . Beckinsale is Beckinsale presence who seems most alive when a director does n’t take her intelligence Beckinsale granted —   which is rare . "
