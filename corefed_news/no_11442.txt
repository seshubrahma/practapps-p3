"   Partial transcript as follows : MADDOW : Senator , I   know your time is limited . I just have one last question for you and it ’s because you raised the issue of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump . Obviously Mr. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had an issue with violence at his events Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump He has Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump you . He recently Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump your supporters for showing up to his events Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump mounting protests that are disruptive . What advice   —    obviously I do n’t blame you . But what advice would you have for your supporters or for protesters who show up for any reason to Trump events Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump whether they ’re to protest on your behalf or someone else ’s ? SANDERS : Well , first of all , Rachel , you may know at least in my view , Donald Trump Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pathological liar . There ’s very little that he says that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump can at face value believe to be correct . We have never , not once , urged any supporter of ours to disrupt We meeting . I think that ’s kind of counterproductive . Having a respective demonstration —   a protest —   is I think absolutely right . You have a guy here in Trump who has Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump Muslims , insulted Mexicans , insulted women , insulted the    community , insulted veterans , you know , and I think it is totally right for people to protest . Disrupting rallies is not my style . I would urge people not to do that . Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
