On Friday ’s broadcast of CNN ’s " New Day , " former Clinton campaign Press Secretary Brian Fallon stated , " Every day there are new developments , new shoes dropping , so to speak , that call into question the legitimacy of former Clinton campaign Press Secretary Brian Fallon [   Donald Trump ’s ] win . "   former Clinton campaign Press Secretary Brian Fallon said , " Every day there are new developments , new shoes dropping , so to speak , that call into question the legitimacy of his win . First it was with respect to Russian interference . They tried to deny   —    the Trump folks did , that Russia was behind this , now They ’ve been forced to admit that . Then They tried to say that it was not for the purposes of trying to help Donald Trump , They were just trying to sow confusion and They were targeting both sides . And now , folks in the government have concluded that it was actually to try to tip the election Donald Trump ’s way . And now , with respect to the FBI , we see that Jim Comey ’s actions are sufficiently questionable that the internal watchdog at DOJ thinks that Jim Comey’s actions merit an independent review . So , I think Donald Trump is just trying to cling to whatever legitimacy still is in effect here . " (   Grabien ) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
