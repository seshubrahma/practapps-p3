Sunday on CBS ’s " Face the Nation , "    columnist for The Washington Post Michael Gerson said some Republicans are at stage of panic over presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump .    columnist for The Washington Post Michael Gerson said , " Well , I think that Republican leaders , like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have proven that it does n’t matter what presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says , some Republicans ’re willing to swallow it . presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has already accused presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump opponent of possible complicity in murder , and now presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s accused the president of treason . There ’s nothing they wo n’t take . But the thing that ’s changing in the polling is support among Republicans . " " And that , I think , all of a sudden , if it look like the House of Representatives is at risk , if the House of Representatives looks like a debacle , a disaster , you ’re going to find Republicans all across the country rediscovering Republicans conscience when it comes to Donald Trump . And we ’re on that verge . we   —    you know , Republicans are at a stage of panic in the Republican National Committee many . The question is whether Republicans ’re going to move to a state of revolt . And that ’s what I think what we ’re going to see in the next two weeks . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
