’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’      Insofar that normal people watch congressional hearings , any      casual viewer would have read this as confirmation of election      " hacking " and undue influence from the Russian government . But      President Trump , perhaps interested in shaping the narrative of      this hearing and investigation , offered a different      interpretation on Twitter , through the official POTUS account .      " The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence      the electoral process , "   adding a brief clip of      the hearing for readers to watch .    ’ ’      This was n’t true . In a brief clip of     the hearing for readers to watch , Rep. Devin Nunes , chair of the      Intelligence Committee , asked Adm. Mike Rogers , the director      the National Security Agency , if he Adm. Mike Rogers, the director     the National Security Agency any evidence that      Russia tampered with vote totals in the state of Michigan .      Rogers answered no . Nunes then asked the same question for the      states of Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , Florida , North Carolina , and      Ohio —   all swing states in the presidential election .    ’ ’   ’ ’      Rogers Rogers again , answered in the negative . " I have nothing      generated by the National Security Agency , " he Rogers . Comey      answers similarly , telling Nunes Rogers ’s no evidence from the      FBI that the Russian government had tampered with actual votes .    ’ ’        In fact , conspiracy theorists   no one argues otherwise . The actual        allegation is more limited : That , as ranking Democrat Adam        Schiff asserted in his ranking Democrat Adam       Schiff to the        committee , " A foreign , adversarial power intervened in an        effort to weaken our democracy , and to influence the outcome        for one candidate and against the other . "      ’ ’        That intervention , Schiff ranking Democrat Adam       Schiff , was hacked data ,        " weaponized " and disseminated through " existing          channels like WikiLeaks . " To deny    in other        words , is not to preclude outside interference . Nunes’        questioning is besides the point , and Trump ’s interpretation        of that Nunes’       questioning dishonest .      ’ ’        This lying was so brazen that it almost This lying   from Trump ’s earlier claim that President        Obama had " wiretapped " him during President       Obama campaign . " With respect        to the president ’s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed        at him by President       Obama prior administration , I have no information        that supports those tweets , and we have looked carefully        inside        FBI , " said Comey .      ’ ’        Likewise , said Rogers , " We know there was not a wiretap on        Trump Tower . However , it ’s a wiretap on       Trump Tower possible that other        surveillance activities were used against President Trump Trump In fact , the election lie was so brazen that        Comey Comey Comey refute it in real time , which he        the election lie Comey ’ ’   ’ ’        Thus far , in the past few weeks , Trump has forced American        intelligence agencies to investigate a conspiracy theory with        almost no basis in fact , while using his platform to        discredit an actual inquiry Trump his campaign               administration .      ’ Trump        He ’s   an allied        government of Trump , and if recent reporting is any        indication , he is convinced of the reality of a Trump        plot , despite all evidence to the contrary . It ’s        extraordinary behavior , compounded by the fact that Trump        lies with unprecedented ease and frequency .      ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’It ’s difficult to describe the feeling of . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
