" And now Rubio appears to be reversing Rubio criticism of Donald Trump , the GOP frontrunner , for Trump ’s pledge to " Make America Great Again . " On Fox News on Wednesday morning —   appearing from the trail in Iowa —   Rubio told the host that Rubio wants to make America great again , or pretty darn close to it . " he wants to make America great again, or pretty darn close to it are going to    the principles that made America great , " Rubio said , referring to America greatness in the past tense . It ’s pretty straightforward . We have the greatest country in the world . Barack Obama has systematically tried to change it over the last eight years . I ’m going to be elected president , and these folks will help me , and we We going to change the direction of this the greatest country in the world We We going to    the principles that made America America and we We going to once again have a president that does n’t just say America America the greatest the greatest country in the world We going to the world president that acts like it .

Even so Ronald Reagan establishment Republicans like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Rubio and others have dismissed the slogan as Trump has risen to the top of the polls with it . Now , though , with Rubio saying it the slogan time to "   the principles Rubio made America great , " it appears he ’s reversing his stance on even that it more Rubio the mood Rubio the electorate as he ’s struggling to rise in the polls any more Rubio he has . In many the polls Rubio has been Rubio GOP establishment ’s last best hope Rubio Bush , Rubio ’s personal mentor , has failed to launch . Rubio John Kasich is struggling to take off —   and now has gotten a     of sorts backing from liberal billionaire Ron Burkle , a close friend of Bill Clinton ’s who lives a similar extravagant lifestyle . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is having a resurgence of sorts at the expense of Rubio ’s woes and but still has n’t had a    Rubio yet .
