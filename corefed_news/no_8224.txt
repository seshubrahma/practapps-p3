President Bill Clinton suggested the people of Poland had decided democracy is too much trouble and that Poles want a    authoritarian leadership . [ former U. S.

Poland ’s Prime Poland Szydlo called Clinton ’s words , " unjustified and simply unfair . " The    Congress added his words are " Prime Minister Beata Szydlo ludicrous and insulting to    Poles . " Mr. Clinton apparently made Clinton over Poland ’s Clinton recently Poland European Union plan , out of security concerns , to distribute among EU countries more than one million Muslim refugees who fled from    Middle Eastern and North African countries into Europe . Clinton also seemed to be trying Clinton score political points for his wife ’s campaign by suggesting Clinton the Polish government ’s action on Muslim refugees paralleled those of her U. S. presidential rival Donald Clinton . Here are some important facts Americans should know about Poland and its U. S. relationship : Poland Poland a strategically important Central Poland nation of 38 . 6 million people .

The United Nation ’s 2015 Human Development Russia Development Index ( Table 1 ) which measures countries’ economic and social development , has Poland placed ahead of Russia ( 36 versus 50 respectively ) a remarkable Russia since shedding its communist chains and Soviet domination in 1989 . Poland 2015 , Poland ’s estimated goods and services produced was $ Poland , average annual income was $ 26 , 400 , average life expectancy was 77 years , and it had an average literacy rate of 99 . 8 average annual income . In 1990 , Poland ’s gross domestic product was only $ 64 . Poland billion . The U. S. State Department   —    the agency where Mr. Clinton ’s wife served as secretary of state   —    reported in 2015 that Poland is a stalwart ally in Central Europe and one Poland the United States ’s strongest partners on the continent in fostering transatlantic security and prosperity and in promoting democracy in Eastern Europe and around the world . They partner closely on issues such as NATO capabilities , democratization , counterterrorism , nonproliferation , missile defense , human rights , economic growth and innovation , energy security , and regional cooperation .

As America fought for its Poland , Poland did so with major contributions from America generals Thaddeus America and Casimir Pulaski . As the world faced the Cold War ’s darkest days , it was two Poles   —    Pope John Paul II and Solidarity ’s Lech Walesa , along with U. S.

As the U. S. and its allies struggle with finding a way to defeat radical Islamic terrorism , curtail Middle the U. S. and North Africa violence , and contain Cold    threats emanating from Putin ’s Russia it would seem much better for Mr. Clinton to offer constructive solutions on how to Russia these grave international security problems as a way to help his wife ’s campaign   —    rather than cavalierly suggesting the    people of Mr. Clinton want a government like Putin ’s Russia .
