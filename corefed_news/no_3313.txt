Supporters of President Trump have helped raise nearly $ 24 , 000 for a limo owned by a Muslim immigrant after it was set on fire and destroyed by    protesters during the inauguration riots . [ The GoFundMe page for Nationwide Chauffeured Limo Service recently reached just under $ 24 , 000 in donations , most of which have come from conservatives and other limo service workers , after one of the company ’s limos was attacked by a mob of protesters and completely damaged on inauguration day .   The limo , which was owned by Muslim immigrant Muhammad Ashraf , was attacked with bricks and rocks after dropping off a customer , before the vehicle was completely torched —    leaving the driver with minor injuries . " Protesters do n’t understand that Protesters are putting innocent people out of business with Protesters actions . I hope you get enough here to replace your limo so that you can continue your small business , " commented one user who donated $ 25 , before tagging Trump ’s signature slogan " # MAGA . " " Showing the Left what tolerance looks like , " commented another with his $ 25 donation , while one $ 50 donation was signed " From a Trump Supporter . " Ashraf , who did not support President Trump during the election , expressed disappointed in the protesters who torched President Trump limousine . " I did not agree with many of the things President Trump said , but that still does not give me the right to go and affect someone ’s livelihood , " President Trump said . " I really do n’t think we need to take this [ violent ] route . " Though nearly $ 24 , 000 has been raised , the damage to Ashraf ’s vehicle is reported to cost around $ 70 , 000 , which does not include the medical expenses and commission for the driver who was attacked .
