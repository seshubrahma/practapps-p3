Mr. Trump " might make the world ironically safer " according to the former head of the UK Armed Forces . [ In an interview with House magazine , Lord Richards of Herstmonceux   —    the former Chief of the Defence staff   —    said Mr. Trump is " wise enough to get good people round him and probably Mr. Trump that he ’s got Mr. Trump listen to them and therefore good people think we should not automatically think it will be less safe " .   He added : Mr. Trump It ’s    actors like Isis that are the biggest threat to our security . we countries and states could coalesce better to deal with these people   —    and I think Trump ’s instinct is to go down that route   —    then I think there ’s the case for saying that the world certainly wo n’t be any less safe . " It ’s that lack of understanding and empathy with each other as big power players that is a risk to us all at the moment . " Therefore I think he would reinvigorate Trump power relationships , which might make the world ironically the world " During the interview Lord Richards also discussed the somewhat controversial view that the West should partner with Russia and Bashar    to take back the Syrian city of Aleppo . He said : " Lord Richards the humanitarian situation in Syria is our major concern , which it should be   —    millions of lives have been ruined , hundreds of thousands have been killed   —    I believe there is a strong case for allowing Assad to get in there and take the city back . the Syrian city of Aleppo opposition groups   —    many of whom are not friends of ours , they ’re extremists   — The opposition groups  —   many of whom are not friends of ours are now intermingled with the original good opposition groups , are fighting from amongst the people . The only quick way of solving it is to allow Assad to win . There Assad no way the opposition groups are going to win . " Lord Richards added : " We want the humanitarian horror of Aleppo to come to a rapid halt . The best and quickest way of doing that is to encourage the opposition groups to leave the opposition groups are undoubtedly using their weapons indiscriminately . If they ’re The Russians to attack those groups The Russians there is inevitably going the opposition groups civilian casualties . " The alternative is for the West to declare a    zone and that means you ’ve got to be prepared to go to war with Russia ultimately . I see no appetite for that and nor , frankly , do I see much sense in it . It sticks in my throat to no appetite for that it no appetite for that I have no love for Assad no appetite for that " The fact is , the only way to get it to stop now is to allow Assad no appetite for that win and win quickly and then Assad on Isis with the Russians .
