’’ ’President Barack Obama spent a significant portion of ’President Barack Obama trip through Asia selling a key part of ’President Barack Obama legacy that has come under fire back home by both the 2016 presumptive Republican nominee and an insurgent Democrat garnering plenty of support himself.’ ’The    Partnership , the major proposed trade agreement among the US and 11 Pacific Rim countries , has suddenly become a major issue in the 2016 election . So too has the overall effect of free trade on the American economy.’ ’"Especially when you have multiple parties involved , folks are going to be scrutinizing the American economy.’ ’"Especially , they’’re going to be debating the American economy.’ ’"Especially , and in an election year you can anticipate that some folks are going to try to score political points off the American economy.’ ’"Especially , " Obama said during a news conference in Vietnam as part of his trip.’ ’The TPP opens up trade barriers between the US and other Pacific Rim nations . The framework for the deal was laid during the administration of President George W. Bush . The framework for the deal had been at the bargaining table for nearly a decade before other Pacific Rim nations signed the agreement earlier this year . It must be The framework for the deal by early 2018 to take effect.’ ’The deal is the cornerstone of the " pivot to Asia , " a signature goal of the Obama administration’ ’s    agenda.’ ’"I remain confident we’’re going to get it done , agenda.’ ’"I Obama said . " And the reason I’’m confident is because it’ ’s the right thing to do . It’ ’s good it’ the country . America good it’ America . It’ ’s good it’ the region . It’ ’s good it’ the world . " ’ " But Donald Trump , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , and Bernie Sanders , the insurgent Democrat chasing Hillary Clinton for the party ’s nomination , have spent the bulk of their campaigns trying to "’ "But Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and Bernie Sanders, the insurgent Democrat chasing Hillary Clinton for the party’s nomination voters that it ’s not . And Clinton , who helped negotiate and pushed the agreement as secretary of state , . " ’During this US election cycle , trade agreements have undergone a sort of character assassination.’ ’During   last week , Trump called TPP and     trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement " disgusting , the absolute worst ever negotiated by any country in the world . " ’ ’He insinuated that they had led to the US being " viewed as the stupid country , " shrugging off the potential consequences of a trade war with other countries.’ ’"These dummies say , ’’ Oh , that’ ’s a trade war , ’’ " he said . " that’ war ? We’’re losing $ 500 billion in trade with China . Who the hell cares if there’ ’s a trade war ? " ’ ’’ " Tony Fratto , the deputy press secretary in the Bush administration who is now a managing partner at Hamilton Place Strategies , was heavily involved in the administration ’s international trade policy . He said he was Tony Fratto, the deputy press secretary in the Bush administration who is now a managing partner at Hamilton Place Strategies surprised Tony Fratto, the deputy press secretary in the Bush administration who is now a managing partner at Hamilton Place Strategies the rhetoric on trade that had been tossed around along the campaign trail . " ’"Given the candidates who were running , I can’’t say I was very surprised , " said Fratto , who is in favor of the historic trade deal . " I think there’ ’s almost nostalgic view for sometime in the past when trade deals were easy to do . And the truth is , it absolutely has never the truth been easy to do . They’’ve always been hard to do . " ’ " Trump has said he can , with Trump help of talented businessmen , renegotiate all of the US ’s trade deals to better benefit the country . " ’Fratto , a supporter of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida in the GOP primary , said the trade debate would most likely be much different if Bush had been the former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida . He also said Sanders former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida forced Clinton to the left on trade policy.’ ’But that Trump has been able to make it a key pillar policy.’ ’But his agenda is particularly former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida : Free and open trade has traditionally been a cornerstone of the Republican platform . When the original TPP agreement was first announced , Obama found more resistance from Democratic allies than he did from Republicans.’ Obama don’’t really think of his voters as the ’"I base , " Fratto said of Trump’ ’s support.’ " He said many Republicans Fratto to the deal were n’t against a    agreement with the Pacific nations but rather were skeptical of Obama , looking to curb any amount of extra power he may be able Fratto wield . " ’"We have an incoherent party , " Fratto , who is    said . " And I think it’ ’s unsustainable the way it is . We it’ go through many more elections like this , because you’’re rejecting the views can’’t the majority of the party   —    and that’ ’s why I think there’ ’s such turmoil this year . We’’re stuck with a protectionist    nominee now , and we’’re going to have to deal with it . " ’ We’’re , he said , it We’’re almost " doesn’’t matter , and not only because he believes Clinton will We’’re the presidency . He believes TPP will We’’re be ratified.’ ’’ ’"There are lots of presidential candidates who have opposed trade   —    there are no presidents who have opposed trade , " he said . " We’’re the postwar period , there have been no    presidents . Every president has been   . Even if they hadn’’t been as presidential candidates . " ’ ’The difference , he said , is We’’re as president the realization kicks in that those deals are not just important from an economic standpoint but from a national security and diplomatic one as well.’ " The way trade is discussed by many in the US does n’t typically include either of those last two points , Fratto suggested . Plus , people seem to be more interested in whether a trade deal comes across as bashing China rather than on how it opens up other economies . " ’The best way to sell a trade deal to Congress and to the American people is to describe it as    which is not the most important rationale behind such a deal , Fratto said.’ ’"There are intrinsic benefits to having a more open economy and reducing barriers to trade , " he said . " Fratto said.’ underestimate the capacity for the American people to the American people and approve of them . " ’ ’’ ’’ the American people ’"The thing that Americans need to understand is that an overwhelming majority of our job loss , especially in manufacturing , has nothing to do with trade at all , " Fratto said . " It has to do with the application of technology . It’ ’s productivity and management and technology that is being applied to a lot of complex manufacturing that is reducing the need for workers . That is not going to change . " ’ " That ’s exactly what Obama expressed in his State of the Union address earlier this year . But the argument has fallen mostly on deaf ears . " ’The trade debate has evolved . And the number of candidates gunning for the presidency has shrunk.’ ’"I have not yet seen a credible argument that once we get TPP in place we’’re going to be worse off , " Obama said during his overseas trip Obama " We Obama demonstrably better off . American workers and American businesses are better off if we get this deal passed . And I’’m confident we will get it passed . we ’ ’President this deal Obama spent a significant . .. ’
