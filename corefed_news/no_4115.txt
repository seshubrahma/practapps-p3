I kept thinking , what does Theresa May think of this , this morning , when Theresa May picks up the papers ?    …      What if you ’re Putin ? You ’re probably pounding the table , saying , that ’s what I ’ve been saying , Russia first , Russia first . This whole bullying message to Putin . " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
