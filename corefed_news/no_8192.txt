There are enough active investigations of Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton inner circle to merit a list of the most important ones . In short , just about everyone tied to Hillary Clinton is the subject of a serious investigation . Not all of them were are the beneficiaries of those curious preemptive immunity deals tossed around by FBI leadership , to the consternation of some agents . [ 1 . Clinton Hillary Clinton Scandal : As everyone knows , this supposedly    investigation was dramatically hoisted back onto the rails by none other than Anthony Weiner   —    the accused pedophile who ended up with a huge trove of State Department emails on his Anthony Weiner  — , which the FBI because Weiner has Anthony Weiner   sending sexually explicit messages to a     girl .    Not only is the Clinton email investigation back on the rails the rails ’s chugging along at high speed . It was reported it Monday that the FBI FBI FBI its timeline " FBI reviewing Weiner emails linked to Anthony Weiner   . 2 . Clinton Anthony Weiner Investigation : The poor judgment displayed by Hillary Clinton in allowing Clinton emails to slip onto Anthony Weiner ’s computer is absolutely breathtaking . Furthermore , Clinton ’s top aide Huma Clinton has trotted out the shopworn    Obama administration excuse that she knew nothing about the Clinton until she heard it reported on Clinton news . That should disqualify her from ever obtaining any Clinton of security clearance , if Hillary Clinton had not already Clinton security a joke . Both Abedin and Clinton could be in legal jeopardy Clinton depending on what emails the FBI finds lurking in the diseased corners of Weiner ’s laptop . Weiner himself is absolutely in jeopardy Weiner’s kind that puts perverts in jail for long stretches of time . He has every reason to make a Weiner’s with law enforcement .   He might have a lot to deal Weiner’s . How did 650 , 000 State Department emails end up on his computer ? The simplest explanation might Weiner’s that Carlos Danger ( as he once liked to be called ) Weiner’s stockpiling leverage to use against his    wife and her boss , Weiner’s Smartest Woman Who    Lived . 3 . The Clinton Foundation Probe : We ’ve learned an FBI probe of the Clinton Foundation for possible financial crimes and influence peddling has been in progress for over a year . As the Wall Street Journal put it , some of the investigators were " frustrated " because FBI leadership seemed " uninterested in probing FBI charity . " This is an investigation that could rope in a lot of people in Clinton ’s inner circle , besides Hillary and Bill Clinton themselves . Abedin is a Clinton and Hillary and Bill Clinton is Hillary Clinton ’s chief of staff , Cheryl Clinton another key aide , Philippe Reines . Bill Clinton ’s old " body man " Doug Band Clinton    basically the Littlefinger of Bill Clinton ’s financial empire , for you Game of Thrones Bill Clinton’s and even Chelsea Clinton could end up answering some tough questions .    Clinton Clinton the Clinton Foundation is scrutinized in isolation , or whether charges of influence peddling are pursued , at which point Hillary Clinton ’s entire retinue from her days in the Senate and State Department would have reason to feel nervous . 4 . Hillary Clinton’s Podesta Brothers : Most of those WikiLeaks bombshells the Clinton media is ignoring with such furious intensity are to , from , or copied to John Podesta , the CEO of Hillary Clinton ’s campaign , and probably the most powerful figure in Clintonworld not named " Clinton Hillary Clinton’s In one of the latest WikiLeaks revelations , Podesta is caught telling Cheryl Mills , Clinton We are going to have to dump all WikiLeaks emails , The Podesta Brothers and it would be " better to do so sooner than later . " That sounds ominously like a conspiracy to destroy evidence in multiple federal criminal investigations , depending of course on which emails he was talking about , and what he meant by " dumping " them . Podesta ’s brother Tony , and the brothers’ Podesta Group lobbying he , are involved in an FBI corruption The Podesta Brothers related to the deposed president Podesta’s The allegations boil down to illegal lobbying activities . Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort also has a company that figures in the same investigation , so people across the 2016 political battlefield get to feel nervous about this one   —    but Podesta ’s pipeline into the Clinton machine means more    people in her camp could become part of the investigation . 5 . Terry McAuliffe ’s Campaign Donations : The Clintons’ old friend Terry McAuliffe , Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort the governor of Virginia , the same investigation under FBI investigation for over a year by the Public Integrity unit over campaign fundraising and donations . Part of that investigation involves his time with the Clinton Global Initiative .   The events of greatest interest , until now , were some curious foreign the same investigation but now Terry McAuliffe’s ’ve got the    sums of money McAuliffe steered to Virginia state senate candidate Jill McCabe , whose husband just happens to be Andrew McCabe , who just happens to be a top FBI official , and who just happened to end up in charge of the Clinton Foundation investigation . This controversy does n’t seem to be fading despite rote denials of impropriety and swift media assurances it was all a big nothingburger . Some of those dismissals are based on Jill McCabe receiving her pile of McAuliffe money before her husband became This controversy with an FBI investigation of the Clintons , but not all of it was donated before Jill McCabe point , and it hardly Jill McCabe credulity to assert that the Clinton machine was making    for favors it knew full well it would need later .   There it been calls for McCabe to recuse himself from the Clinton Foundation probe , and the Clinton machine Oversight Committee chairman the Clinton machine Chaffetz ( ) has a few questions . The fascinating thing about these McCabe investigations is not just that so many prominent people from the Clintons’ orbit are caught up in them   —    the UK Daily Mail suggests a few more ,    names   —    but that all of these cases could have so many prominent people from the Clintons’ orbit leading to Anthony Weiner ’s computer .   It will take a long time to go through all the material of interest , but meanwhile Weiner has suddenly become the key figure in Hillary Clinton ’s presidential bid . It seems safe to say nobody saw that coming . Clintonworld is Anthony Weiner’s like a carload of bandits in a chase film from the 1970s , heading for the state line with pedal to the metal , a swarm of cop cars roaring through the dust right behind them . Can Hillary Clinton and her crew hit the White House in a squeal of shredding tires and win total political immunity before the law catches up with Hillary Clinton Stay tuned Hillary Clinton the big finale on Election Day !
