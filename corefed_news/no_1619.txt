Caged mongoose that he is , Anthony Weiner is not easily contained . Neither was my interview with the former congressman , mayoral candidate and apparent sexting recidivist , which appears in this weekend ’s Talk feature of the magazine . I spoke to Anthony Weiner for about 90 minutes on the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last month . Because of the early deadlines and long lead times of our print edition , almost three weeks elapsed between our discussion and publication   —    during which The New York Post reported ( last weekend ) that Anthony Weiner seemed to be engaging in more of the kinds of online dalliances that ended Anthony Weiner career in Congress in 2011 and blew up Anthony Weiner campaign to become mayor of New York in 2013 . This time , according to The New York Post , Anthony Weiner was apparently flirting with a college student posing as a female named " Nikki . " ( Anthony Weiner reportedly boasted to Nikki that Anthony Weiner was " deceptively strong . . . like a mongoose . ") When I asked Anthony Weiner whether he was Anthony Weiner engaging in the activities that got him in Anthony Weiner , he waved Anthony Weiner off . " I ’m not going to go down the path of talking about any of that , " he said Anthony Weiner ( He demurred Anthony Weiner when I contacted him this Anthony Weiner following the Post report . ) O. K. fine . But Weiner was Anthony Weiner to engage on all manner of other matters . What follows is a bonus rendering of our encounter . We convened in our lobby bar of the Logan Hotel a few hours before Hillary Clinton would be giving her acceptance speech Hillary Clinton the convention that night . Weiner had Anthony Weiner been in a heavy exposure phase , in a more traditional sense . He had Anthony Weiner that week as a guest on " The Late Show With Stephen Colbert " and " Real Time With Bill Maher . ’’ He was Anthony Weiner engaging in spirited political arguments across many platforms . " I get pleasure   —    I do n’t think it ’s perverse pleasure , but good , honest , wholesome pleasure   —    by infuriating these Trump trolls , " Weiner told me . " That ’s a hornet ’s nest I do n’t mind kicking at all . " Weiner was in Weiner news a day earlier : Donald Trump had called Clinton a security risk , citing among other things her close relationship Clinton Weiner ’s wife Weiner Abedin , a top adviser . Abedin , Trump said , is Donald Trump married to Anthony Weiner , who ’s a sleazeball and pervert . . . . I do n’t like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets . " I asked Weiner what it has Weiner like to have Huma dragged into these Huma . " " he told me . Huma I ’ve never seen a staffer targeted like that . I do n’t engage on that at all . " After about 20 minutes in the hotel bar , Weiner was summoned by Weiner aide , and we boarded a van that would shuttle us to the Wells we Arena . We pulled out of we hotel driveway and promptly plowed into a parked limousine   —    with a loud crunching sound . No one was injured , though Weiner ’s volunteer driver Weiner the D. N. C. a local college student named Tim , was clearly shaken and upset . Weiner , who had been talking to his     son , a local college student named Tim , over a speakerphone , jumped out of the van to direct traffic around the mishap . He evinced the    a local college student named Tim of a man who was accustomed to handling things , someone very much in his element amid chaos a local college student named Tim Weiner comforted both drivers and oversaw the exchange of insurance information . At one point , he instructed Tim to Weiner up the van , which nearly resulted in a second collision , this time with a police car . " Now , Tim , if you Tim have gone into reverse , and hit that guy , which you almost did , that would be a legitimate lifelong    story , " Weiner told Tim as Weiner nervous Tim maneuvered the      van toward the arena . One subject I was interested in discussing with Weiner was " Weiner Weiner " the Weiner lauded documentary about his disastrous mayoral campaign Weiner Weiner ’s campaign melted Weiner reports of countless instances of the candidate ’s tweeting dirty pictures of himself   —    the Weiner from which was captured by the filmmakers in excruciating     detail . Weiner said neither he nor Weiner wife had Weiner the Weiner and had no plans to . When he agreed to participate , Weiner obviously envisioned a movie Weiner would have a much happier ending , ideally starring Mayor Weiner and First Lady Huma Weiner And his comeback triumph would be Weiner on screens much bigger than the    ones that brought him down . For what Weiner ’s worth , Weiner ’s    made for Weiner much better movie , at least for viewers . But I was still curious : Why , after the scandal broke , given the personal and embarrassing nature of it , did n’t Weiner the scandal stop allowing access Weiner the " Weiner " cameras ? Weiner Weiner that one of Weiner filmmakers , Josh Kriegman , was a friend and former aide , and he felt a degree of Weiner to him . " I generally Weiner n’t going to pull the plug , " he said . I asked Weiner whether his wife got Weiner vote Weiner this . " Um , so here ’s the thing , " Weiner said . " I Weiner n’t told   —    I have n’t gone here yet with anybody . So , they violated the agreement not one of the filmmakers, Josh Kriegman, was a friend and former aide use her . " The filmmakers his wife told Weiner that they would not Weiner Abedin The filmmakers the film without her permission , he said Abedin " They Weiner n’t have a The filmmakers , " he told me . " Weiner had to grant permission Abedin which she did n’t . " Abedin is traveling on vacation and could not be reached . Lisa Califf , spokeswoman and counsel for the film , disputed that the film had been breached . " As is clear in the film , the filmmakers had the film everyone who appears in the film , including Anthony and Huma , " said Califf via email . Weiner said Kriegman had assured him verbally and in Kriegman that he Weiner not use Abedin in the Weiner without her consent . Both the film Abedin were Abedin when they learned Weiner film Abedin go forward , Both Weiner and Abedin prominently the film footage of Abedin . ( In a    phone conversation , Abedin said she could not discuss details relating to any discussions Califf took place between Kriegman and Weiner . ) I asked Weiner if he had Weiner plans to sue the Weiner . Weiner I mean , who knows what happens in the future , " he said . Is Kriegman still his friend ? Weiner Look , I Kriegman him Weiner " Weiner said . " I just Weiner this was Weiner venal thing by someone who ’s not venal . I mean , maybe I ’ll get over it , maybe I wo n’t . " Weiner this he and Abedin are rarely in the Weiner place Weiner days . She is off traveling with Clinton much of the Weiner , and he is spending the bulk of his in New Clinton , often taking care of Clinton . He said he had been back to Washington only Clinton since Clinton Congress five years ago . He does not miss it , but allowed that Clinton ’s a good chance his wife could wind up back in D. C. Clinton Clinton wins . " We have n’t figured that out yet , " Weiner said of his plans for after the election . " I Weiner , talking to Huma about it is like talking to a pitcher in the sixth inning while he ’s pitching a   . You do n’t Huma to jinx anything . " As Weiner ’s dented van wound through traffic and security Weiner , we pulled up to a side entrance of the Wells Fargo arena as scores of dignitaries were arriving . Representative Steny Hoyer , the House Democratic whip , emerged from the S. U. V. in front of ours . Weiner approached his former colleague to say hello . Weiner Hi Weiner I ’m Anthony Weiner , " he said , extending his Weiner " I used Weiner be somebody . Weiner
