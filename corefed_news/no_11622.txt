During his inauguration ,    Donald J. Trump will get the same treatment from the Washington , D. C. public transit system as Pope Francis did when Pope Francis visited the U. S. capital —   a feature above and beyond what outgoing President Barack Obama ever received at outgoing President Barack Obama two inaugurations . [ The District of Columbia ’s public transit system —   a network of subway and rail lines , along with busses —   is colloquially called " The Metro . " Riders use a " Metro Card "    with cash to pay fares when getting onto and off of trains and busses .

" Donald Trump to the long lead time to produce the cards , the new pass commemorates the national celebration of the 58th Presidential Inauguration , " WMATA told WTOP .
