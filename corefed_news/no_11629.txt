And lost in this process are black people . " She said she She her She to " reach those people , telling them those people honest truth about why we can not get problems solved in the black community . " " No one touched my article , Bannon , " Johnson said proudly . Elaborating , she She : I did not get a single negative comment from one black progressive . No one called me an " Uncle Tom . " No No one me a " coon . " No one No one name all across their headlines , saying how bad I was . But what did occur was Stacey Dash saying that he is a Stacey Dash progressive slave on a plantation . ( The blog post from Stacey Dash to Stacey Dash referred may be read here . After displaying a video of Williams’ speech , Dash exclaimed , " Stacey Dash ’ve just seen the perfect example of a HOLLYWOOD plantation slave ! Sorry , Mr Williams . But the fact that you were standing on that stage at THOSE awards tells people you really do n’t know what your [ sic ] talking about . Just spewing hate and anger . ") " Every single piece of black media picked up that title , that tag , everywhere , to tell black people Republicans do not like you . They think you ’re Republicans a plantation . They think that you Republicans a slave , " said Johnson . " This is why we continue to lose , and there is a generation of us that are tired we this . And I swear , I just wish we had Republicans and we on our side , in we issue . " Johnson said that in Johnson own article , she sought to " her on this constant bickering between the Right and the Left , between progressives and conservatives , " that leaves out the real life experiences of actual black people . " We are at a time where we have this opportunity We front of us to crack this We shell , " she declared . " her Trump has put the cracks in it . We just Donald Trump to We breaking it . But we Donald Trump n’t get We of our own way to We it . " " Donald Trump you go back , if you look on Twitter right now , to see all of the blacks that are in support of Donald Trump , every Donald Trump show , shows that that support does n’t exist . Every person they put on says that they people will not support Trump , " said Johnson Donald Trump   She insisted that these measurements Every person they put on underestimate Trump ’s support among black voters . Johnson said : If you Johnson on any of the social media , if you go on any of the social networks , you see the outpouring of support . And not only are they supporting , they ’re the outpouring of support supporting . the outpouring of support ’re putting out facts the outpouring of support They ’re challenging memes . the outpouring of support have a group of black people that are fighting for a Republican in Donald Trump . " This is our chance of a lifetime . If we can stop calling them our , stop talking about the plantation , and start talking about the American Dream   —    what it has to offer , what we as the    have our offer ! Freedom , liberty , financial independence , those are things that we can sell , she said . " But it ’s sad that we would rather pick and we and call names , to try to fight Democrats , instead of actually accomplishing something , " Johnson lamented , adding , " I ’m just sick and tired of fighting this fight , where we ca n’t even get our army on our side we " Johnson we rejected polls that Johnson Trump enjoyed support from just one percent of the black community , with , at most , seven or eight percent undecided . " No way , " she said . " They poll Democrats . They poll people that are They to voting for Democrats and just put their name down . They They not poll average They people . " " This message is very simple . It is wealth over poverty This message If you do not think that blacks understand that message , you have This message entire mind , " Johnson declared . " We are tired of living in poverty . We want greatness . We do We want to be We . We do not want free shit We We want to be able to We in the American system , just the way every other American operates , and that takes wealth . " " It is a simple message , " she repeated . " It gets across through Donald Trump It and black people are listening . " Johnson asserted : You can just look and see the black people that are speaking out , and just think about the ones that are afraid to speak out . Think about the ones that do n’t want the storm to come down on them when they actually say who the black people that are speaking out plan the black people that are speaking out vote for . the black people that are speaking out we give them a safe space , until the black people that are speaking out actually provide them with spaces we can come the black people that are speaking out , where the black people that are speaking out can be themselves , they the black people that are speaking out be authentically the black people that are speaking out they the black people that are speaking out , and still represent the black people that are speaking out principles   —    look we Charlie Rangel . Look at Hillary Clinton . They destroyed themselves . We have the black people that are speaking out fill the black people that are speaking out vacuum we We have to create a space we people to go . And while we just want to criticize and we , we are not building that space we we are not a space for people to go of we opportunity , and it is downright sickening .
