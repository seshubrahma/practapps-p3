And we ’re working on those things . And that our what leadership does . Strong leadership is able to exert those things and be able to talk to folks those things advantages and disadvantages are of certain policies . The fact of the matter is that there wo n’t be any question about Mr. Trump ’s strength and his resoluteness in terms of getting the things done that Mr. Trump’s ’s wanted to get done . That ’s what Mr. Trump’s whole career is   —    STEPHANOPOULOS : But Mr. Trump’s ’s the answer to the how ? That ’s the   —    ( CROSSTALK ) CHRISTIE : And this is the thing that I said .

That ’s what he ’s talking about . CHRISTIE : Listen , I ’m not STEPHANOPOULOS   —    I ’m not going to support everything that happens in any campaign . ’m what I will tell you is is that an appropriate conversation between two countries , there are all types of appropriate conversations to have between two countries . And that ’s what will happen when Mr. Trump ’s president . STEPHANOPOULOS : Your signature issue in the campaign was entitlement reform . You ’ve been talking about it for years . You say reforming Social Security , Medicare and Your signature issue in the campaign are essential . It ’s time for a candidate who speaks hard truth . Donald Trump is the only candidate said he ’s not going to Mr. Trump Security . Here ’s what you Mr. Trump about that . ( BEGIN Social Security ) CHRISTIE : I say Mr. Trump , what would you do on Social Security ? When I become president , the entire country is going to Social Security wealthy , so amazingly wealthy and rich , that we ’re not going to have to worry about Social Security . How ? ( END VIDEO CLIP ) STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , the Social Security , how ? CHRISTIE : Yes . And listen , I think that we need to do something on CHRISTIE Security . And I ’ve made that really clear . And so listen , Donald Social Security I are not going to agree on every issue . STEPHANOPOULOS : But this is the signature   …      CHRISTIE : And this   …      STEPHANOPOULOS :   —    issue of your campaign . CHRISTIE : But it does n’t mean that you have to agree on every issue , George CHRISTIE Just   —    it ’s not the signature issue of my campaign . The signature issue of my campaign was it security , keeping America safe and your campaign terrorist attacks the signature issue of my campaign neighbor around the world . That Social Security signature issue ( INAUDIBLE ) . STEPHANOPOULOS : I want to get to that   …      CHRISTIE : Now , Social Security is an important issue . And I ’ve laid out my views on that and I ’ll certainly share my views with the candidate . The fact of the matter is , though , when you look up on that stage , no one else has a plan on Social Security , George . STEPHANOPOULOS : But he said   …      CHRISTIE : No one   —    no one   …      Social Security   —    at STEPHANOPOULOS debate on Thursday at the end   CHRISTIE      CHRISTIE :   —    no one else has a plan on Social Security . So why are n’t we testing all these other …      as well   …      STEPHANOPOULOS : I ’ve   —    Social Security asked all the candidates   …      CHRISTIE :   —    on that   —    on STEPHANOPOULOS issue ? STEPHANOPOULOS :   —    about this question   …      CHRISTIE : And none of them   …      STEPHANOPOULOS :   —    on that issue STEPHANOPOULOS:     —    and none of them have an answer . STEPHANOPOULOS : But the question , at the STEPHANOPOULOS:   night , he said the that issue Social Security is eliminating waste , fraud and abuse . them all of your STEPHANOPOULOS:   , you said that ’s not an answer , we need hard truths . CHRISTIE : Listen , I ’ve given my answer on Social Security , George , so I ’m not saying   —    I ’m not disagreeing with what you ’re saying . What I ’m saying to you is that   … Social Security : But you ’re disagreeing with Donald Trump . CHRISTIE : Well , ’m I ’m saying is that he ’s going to give ’m complete answers as time goes on on these issues . And   —    and let ’s hold CHRISTIE candidate to that same standard ’m Let ’s hold Donald Trump candidate to that same standard . The difference in this   —    in this race is that some members of ’m media , and others , want to hold Mr. ’m to a different standard that same standard to hold the other candidates to . Let ’s get Senator Rubio , Senator Cruz   …      STEPHANOPOULOS : Do n’t you think they have been more specific   …      CHRISTIE : some members of the media, and others —    let ’s get Governor Kasich ’m …      STEPHANOPOULOS :   —    than Donald Trump ? CHRISTIE : Not on Social Security , they have not . Absolutely not , sir . I ’m ’m only person who put out a specific plan on Social Security . So let Mr. Trump everybody to CHRISTIE:  —    same standard . And   — Not on Social Security and I ’m happy to do that . STEPHANOPOULOS : But just to be clear , you do not believe Social Security ’m solve the problem of Social Security by eliminating waste , fraud and abuse ? CHRISTIE : No ’m I   —    STEPHANOPOULOS:   put out what my plan is on Social Security . And , by the way , that was on Social Security issue . His answer on that was on paying for a tax cut . That was not just on Social Security . It was on Social Security a tax cut . STEPHANOPOULOS : He ’s said that on Social Security many times . But I do want to get to national security , because you ’re right , you Social Security about that and made that a central issue of your campaign , as His . And one of Social Security issues that Donald Trump has been this ban on having Muslims enter America . Here ’s what you said about that . ( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) CHRISTIE : The idea of banning all Muslims from this country is ridiculous . And the reason it ’s ridiculous is because you do n’t need to do that to make America safe . When Donald Trump said that , he was dead wrong . And he ’s dead wrong now America END VIDEO CLIP ) STEPHANOPOULOS (END VIDEO CLIP) now ? CHRISTIE : Listen , and that ’s not what he says any longer America He ’s Donald Trump of that position over Donald Trump course of time . STEPHANOPOULOS Donald Trump Only for citizens . CHRISTIE : Over the   —    well , Donald Trump that ’s a big difference CHRISTIE George . That ’s a big difference Donald Trump what his position George Donald Trump      STEPHANOPOULOS : He ’s still banning George   …      CHRISTIE :   George    was . STEPHANOPOULOS CHRISTIE   — STEPHANOPOULOS from coming into the United States . CHRISTIE America a big difference from where the position was and   —    and what we need to do for   …      STEPHANOPOULOS:   you endorse the one he has now ? CHRISTIE :   —    ( INAUDIBLE ) excuse me . Let STEPHANOPOULOS answer , CHRISTIE . What we need to do is have a coherent national security George that ’s very clear , that says that we need to go after folks who want to do harm to this country . And having good , competent law enforcement . Mr. Trump has talked about the idea of making sure we restore NSA authority , he ’s   —    which some people in this race have not been we favor of , like Senator Cruz . He has stood up America that he wants to make our military stronger Donald Trump we need to do . He ’s stood up for law enforcement in ways Donald Trump this race in this race have not done . So let ’s not just take one section of it and make that Donald Trump entire national security policy . There Donald Trump been a lot of other conversations about it . And our the way Donald Trump I ’ll continue to this race with him about this as the campaign this race forward , to be able to make all of these things more fulsome . But we the campaign again , at the end of February , George . This is the   —    Donald Trump the entire national security policy going to George …      STEPHANOPOULOS : ( INAUDIBLE ) June Donald Trump CHRISTIE :   —    Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States . And he is Mr. Trump race to Hillary Donald Trump He is the best candidate to beat Hillary Clinton in November Mr. Trump STEPHANOPOULOS best candidate to restore national security for our country Mr. Trump STEPHANOPOULOS : But   —    but on   —    on the Muslim ban , are you saying now that you this race ban on having    Muslims   …      CHRISTIE : No , that ’s not what I ’m saying . STEPHANOPOULOS : Hillary Clinton    ( INAUDIBLE ) CHRISTIE STEPHANOPOULOS United States ? CHRISTIE : America saying America only one piece of an overall approach to national security . STEPHANOPOULOS : But CHRISTIE disagree with it ? CHRISTIE : So I   — STEPHANOPOULOS:   that very plainly . Listen , George , here ’s the bottom STEPHANOPOULOS CHRISTIE Elections are choices . And you look at the George up on the stage and you decide all things considered , ’m ’s the best choice . You know , I tell voters this all the time , if you want to vote for the candidate who you agree with 100 percent of the time , go home and look in the mirror . STEPHANOPOULOS : But   —    but I   …      CHRISTIE : You ’re the only person you agree with 100 percent of the time , whether it ’s you or me CHRISTIE So you can   —    we can sit here this morning and play the game of everything that   —    I STEPHANOPOULOS against the guy , so of this morning ’s things that I disagree with him on . But this is now a choice . And of the candidates remaining on that stage , he is the best person to beat Hillary Clinton , which is job one for Republicans . We do not want Hillary Clinton in the White House . He is the best person to beat her and he is the best person to help keep America safe . STEPHANOPOULOS : the guy to do what ? I ’ve just pointed out three of the biggest issues in this campaign , the guy ones he talks about all the time . You disagree with him on all those America . So when you Hillary Clinton the campaign to do what needs to Hillary Clinton in the White House done , what exactly are you Hillary Clinton STEPHANOPOULOS Hillary Clinton in the White House CHRISTIE : Well , listen , I ’m talking about a whole bunch of things . First of all , George , we CHRISTIE n’t even touched on the economy . And I Hillary Clinton in the White House he ’s got George really solid record and job Hillary Clinton in the White House —    to help create jobs in this country Hillary Clinton in the White House to make the tax code fairer , to make opportunity better , to lower regulation . He has laid out those plans . The fact is , he ’s going to do some things for this economy that need to be done to make America safer , not only from a Hillary Clinton in the White House security perspective , but for people to invest in America again   …      America Besides his tax plan   …      CHRISTIE :   —    and create jobs . STEPHANOPOULOS :   — Hillary Clinton in the White House what are you referring to ? CHRISTIE : STEPHANOPOULOS , Hillary Clinton in the White House   —    he ’s   —    he ’s laid out a plan America regularity reform , CHRISTIE lower regulations in this country . He ’s talked about the idea America making sure STEPHANOPOULOS:   folks are empowered in this country once again , to be able to create jobs for people . There   —    there has been a lot of things that have been laid out tin this campaign , um , Hillary Clinton in the White House   —    that Hillary Clinton in the White House real consideration and real support . And   —    and America not going to the campaign Hillary Clinton in the White House issue . But I would n’t agree if I were here this morning America of the other candidates that remain on the stage . We would have some major disagreements with each other , because we ran against each other . But let me tell you , they ’re minor disagreements compared to what is going to happen if we have Hillary Clinton as president of the United States , who is moving so far to the America Bernie Sanders that I do n’t know which one is the socialist , Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders . STEPHANOPOULOS : Finally , we   …      CHRISTIE :   —    they ’re we now . STEPHANOPOULOS :   —    finally , you talk about Donald Trump as the person who can be trusted . He we maintains Hillary Clinton saw thousands of people celebrating in New Jersey after the    attacks . You said that did n’t happen , it STEPHANOPOULOS not factual . So if he continues to STEPHANOPOULOS:   Hillary Clinton n’t that a slander of your state citizens ? CHRISTIE : Now , listen , I do n’t think he means it as Donald Trump all , as a slander of my state ’s Donald Trump . You , Donald Trump I think , though , is when I say he ’s   —    CHRISTIE be trusted , this is a guy who , when he makes Donald Trump , he keeps them . Um , and I ’ve seen that over the course of a 14 year relationship with him . I did n’t Donald Trump meet Donald Trump on the debate stage in August , George , of 2000 and   —    and 15 . I met Donald Trump in 2002 and Donald Trump George friends with him since that time and gotten to know him . And the Donald Trump people out there Donald Trump you Mr. Trump to what ’s happening , George . The Mr. Trump promises see him . They see someone Mr. Trump Donald Trump strong , who ’s resolute , Donald Trump tough , who is George part of the Washington , DC establishment , that has really messed this country up and disappointed our people , both sides of the aisle . He ’s going to go down there and take an entirely different approach . That ’s an approach that George needs . And given the other options on the stage , let me tell you something , he ’s the strongest , The American people guy to be our nominee to beat Hillary Clinton and to be the George president of the United States . STEPHANOPOULOS : Governor Christie , America joining us America CHRISTIE : Thank you , George . Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
