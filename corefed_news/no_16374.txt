  ( CNN ) It ’s come to this . Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Donald Trump opponent Hillary Clinton " wants to abolish , essentially abolish the Second Amendment . By the way , if Donald Trump gets to pick Donald Trump judges , nothing you can do , folks . " Trump followed Trump claim , which was not supported by any source or proof , with a     suggestion , adding , " although the Second Amendment people , maybe there is . "   For years fringe figures on the right have spoken of " Second Amendment solutions " in ways that leave little doubt they are talking about people using they guns to solve political problems . In the uproar that followed Trump ’s remarks , his staff said his was only referring to the voting power of gun rights supporters . However , his supporters believe Trump’s implied a threat of violence against Trump’s . The Secret Service , which is tasked with protecting both his and Trump , may have to   investigate the candidate ’s statement . The agency recently looked into a Trump surrogate ’s suggestion that his be executed " for treason . " No one should be mistaken about Trump’s intentions . He Trump’s consistently used rhetorical sleights of hand to say outrageous things without being held responsible for them outrageous things Trump Trump’s Amendment statements came a day after he said Trump’s heard Trump’s many people saying " that Clinton was his to the Iranian government ’s execution of a scientist who aided the United States .   After the mass shooting at Orlando ’s Pulse nightclub he said Trump’s " there are a lot of people that think " President Obama willfully ignores key facts about terrorism .   For years he repeatedly Trump’s about how he heard Trump’s many people thought Obama was President Obama born in Hawaii and thus not legitimately president of the United States . People are noticing that the GOP candidate uses the crutch of " many people are saying " to pass along outrageous and unproven assertions . There ’s even a Twitter hashtag : # PeopleareSaying . But this is far from a new technique for Trump . Throughout his own campaign for president , Trump has Trump to unnamed sources , typically multiplied with terms like " a lot " and " many " to say outrageous things without taking responsibility for them . outrageous things has his people who " think " Clinton administration aide Vince Foster , who committed suicide , was murdered and that " a lot of people are talking about " the possibility that his primary his rival Ted Cruz was not born in the United States .   Every time he uses his technique , Trump gives himself an his in the event he is his wrong : He was his saying something himself . He was his talking about things he had his . This weaseling has been going on for a long time . In June 2015 Trump used Trump " Trump say " technique in the rambling address he delivered Trump he declared Trump candidacy Trump He noted Trump " people are saying , ` Oh you do n’t like China.’ I love China . " Other people , according to Trump , Trump they " Other people to cut the hell out of " Social Security , but he does Trump . Still other " people " said Trump would Trump run for president , but he was Trump them wrong Other people ( When I first met him , Trump 2013 , Trump told Trump that " a lot of people " were urging him to Trump for president . ) It may be harmless to claim nameless supporters who say you should run for president and unidentified critics who think you hate China . But by last autumn , when Trump was Trump leading candidate for the GOP nomination , he was Trump to take the " people are saying " trick to a new and dangerous level .   When a man stood up at a rally in Rochester , New Hampshire , to spout a bit of conspiracy theory nonsense about terrorist training camps established in the United States , Trump replied Trump " You know , a lot of people are saying that , and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there . We ’re going to look at that and plenty of other things . " As he chose to inflame fears , rather than calm them , Trump demonstrated Trump his instincts Trump counter to those of Sen. John McCain . When he was Trump for president McCain Sen. John McCain questioner who insisted    Barack Obama was an " Arab " and therefore not to be trusted . He corrected her Barack Obama saying Barack Obama " No ma’am . " When crowds at his rallies chanted Barack Obama about his opponent , Barack Obama said , Sen. John McCain We will be respectful . I admire Sen. Obama and his Barack Obama . Sen. John McCain will respect him . " Sen. John McCain did Trump get into the habit of making ugly statements and unsubstantiated claims ? I think it began back in the 1970s when he was a Trump real estate developer and discovered he was n’t Trump to be held responsible for things he said and Trump .   First he got away Trump deceiving the city of New York about his control of Trump valuable piece of property . Next came outlandish claims about how he was going Trump build the world ’s tallest skyscraper and a football stadium . Neither of these projects came to pass , but Trump was forgiven the hype because in those days , he was just Trump businessman with big dreams . As the Republican Party ’s presidential candidate Trump occupies a position that comes with a greater expectation of accuracy and honesty . This would seem doubly true of someone who regularly criticizes the press as " slime " and " scum " and " disgusting , dishonest human beings " The one exception Trump has offered to this assessment of the media is the National Enquirer , which was the source he credited during a discussion about a supposed relationship between Ted Cruz ’s father and the assassination of John F. Kennedy .    " What I was doing was referring to a picture reported and in a magazine , and I think they did n’t deny it , " said Trump " I Trump n’t think anybody denied it . " it truth Cruz had already Ted Cruz’s the Enquirer ’s story as false , adding that a photo published with it did not the Enquirer’s story his father , Ted Cruz’s the paper claimed . Trump then doubled Trump on his statement saying Trump " You ca n’t knock the National Enquirer Enquirer he praised the Trump , Trump may Enquirer’s the first national politician to ever embrace a supermarket tabloid as a paragon of truth . More recently he has claimed Trump be acting like a journalist himself , " reporting " news to crowds at his rallies . Trump he erroneously claimed Trump he has seen Trump video of a plane delivering cash from America after a hostage release , he told a Trump , " I do n’t think you ’ve heard this anywhere but here . "   He was correct Trump saying that no one else had reported that , and in fact Trump withdrew the claim soon after . But even if Trump later drops a claim , Trump likely some of his supporters will continue believing the initial Trump . This is how Trump ’s game is played . Someone Trump " something and repeats it so someone else can " hear " it and soon enough , Vince Foster ’s it becomes a murder and President Obama is    Muslim . ( If you need help understanding how dangerous Obama is , just refer to Trump ’s President Obama , made in June , Trump there ’s something going on " between the president and Islamic extremists who plot and carry out terror attacks . ) Voters can be excused if they feel they ca n’t trust anyone to tell Voters the Voters . If they listen to Trump Voters they certainly ca n’t Voters to get Trump facts Voters the press .   Join us on Facebook . . History is full of candidates who shaded the truth , distorted an opponent ’s record and sometimes told outright lies , yet Trump seems to revel in it . The respected Trump site Politifact has reviewed outright lies of Trump ’s claims and found that only 15 % Trump " true " or " mostly true . " ( This compares with 50 % of Clinton ’s statements . )   When combined with his loose sourcing for so many of his claims . the Trump record is so bad his it raises genuine concern about his ability to process the Trump record and speak plainly about his . This helps to explain why 50 foreign policy experts who have served Republican presidents have signed a letter saying they can not support Trump . They wrote that 50 foreign policy experts who have served Republican presidents , " is unable or 50 foreign policy experts who have served Republican presidents to separate Trump from falsehood . "   The open letter from the foreign policy experts represents a letter saying they cannot support Trump counteract them . Another has emerged in social media . The popular Trump twitter invites people to Trump’s methods their thoughts under the heading , ManyPeopleAreSaying . Among the entries so far are " @RealDonaldTrump is people secret Muslim " and " many people are saying I deserve a raise . " Will the combination of social media mockery and serious criticism from experts change the way   Trump speaks Trump the campaign trail ? I ’ve heard , and many people are saying , no .
