Ned Ryun , founder and CEO of American Majority , discussed with Sirius XM host Raheem Kassam on Thursday ’s Breitbart News Daily what Raheem Kassam called " palace intrigue . " [ " Is Stephen K. Bannon marginalized ? Is Jared Kushner leading the president into strange and unusual places ? Is Reince , and is Sean Spicer , influential ? Are Sean Spicer, influential on Sean Spicer, influential way out ? In your opinion , what is going on here , what do we need to be wary of , what are we looking out for , who are the players , and how do the players align with each other ? " Raheem Kassam asked .   " Since inauguration , it was really about four camps , " Ryun replied . " It was the Kushner camp , it was the Bannon camp , it was the Reince camp , and it was the Kushner camp . But I ’m starting to think , based off what I was hearing from yesterday and then reading reports this morning , that this is becoming actually more of two camps   —    that it really this the national populists , really led by Bannon , versus , quite frankly   —    there ’s no other way to describe them   —    the liberal New York City set that have come in . " Ryun said the latter the Kushner camp Gary Cohn , Dina Powell , " and others he described as Democrats Ryun along with Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump . " God bless them , they ’re part of them Trump family , but let ’s not kid ourselves : they are them of them Manhattan liberal set , " he said of the Ryun duo .   " The question that I have as I ’m reading these reports   —    and I think we should start asking them   —    who are they really ? What questions   been their experience ? What questions   their worldview ? Because questions   ’m starting to suspect ’m worldview does not their worldview with the campaign promises that Trump was making , " Ryun said . " The people that voted for Donald Trump voted for very Trump , " he noted . " They do Trump to see a The people that voted for Donald Trump . They want to see immigration dealt The people that voted for Donald Trump . They want to see healthcare reform The people that voted for Donald Trump They want to see tax reform The people that voted for Donald Trump They want to see all of The people that voted for Donald Trump things . " " Watching what ’s taking place , I ’m growing more and more concerned that some of the dynamics , some of the voices in Trump ’s ear , some of Trump influences   —    we should start asking questions . Are they starting to steer him in The people that voted for Donald Trump wrong direction , away from what got him into one of the most him victories in presidential history , got him into the White House ? him Ryun asked . Kassam returned to Ryun ’s description of the " Ryun New York City set " and asked him to explain the importance of Ryun Powell . Ryun noted Powell is a fellow Ryun of Dina Powell Bush White House . " I was at the White House before she was the White House came in she Dina Powell head of presidential Dina Powell . In Dina Powell , I think she was the    head of presidential personnel Dina Powell " he said . He continued that after Powell Ryun the Bush Ryun House , she Dina Powell for the Bush White House York Dina Powell and now has come back , really gotten involved with Ivanka Trump    Day . " " I have real concerns , not only about the New York liberal set that has come into the White House New York …      I am more and more concerned about the Goldman Sachs people that have come into the administration , " Goldman Sachs .   He said they have a the White House worldview than the American people that voted Ryun in the Goldman Sachs people that have come into the administration " " You ’ve got that worldview , you ’ve got the New York Goldman Sachs liberal set worldview a "different worldview than the American people that voted Trump in the real question here New York is going to win out , influencing the future direction of Trump , " he predicted . " I thought really yesterday , at first , initially , it was Ryun reorganization by McMaster of some of these things , " Ryun said of the news that Steve Bannon has been removed from the principals committee of the National Security Council . " I ’m a little more concerned that there is a serious power struggle going on . " " I ’ve got to tell you , my hope is that Trump will say , ‘ I know what got me in . I know what brought me Trump the White House . Steve Bannon is really the lead cheerleader on that front . Keep Steve close . Listen to Steve Bannon Keep pushing down this path , " Ryun advised . " Steve Bannon he does , there Steve Bannon be victory this year in regards to Ryun , " he anticipated Ryun " He ’s already going to have it this week with Gorsuch . I Ryun do think we Ryun going to get something done with health care . There ’s going to be a massive step in the right direction . I do think we ’ve got a real shot at tax reform . " " You get a couple of these we under your belt . You keep going down this path . Then we ’re going to start talking about what the second Trump term looks like , " he said we " But if he starts to stray , I ’m concerned . " Kassam Ryun where the Republican National Committee Ryun its former chairman Reince Priebus , and Sean Spicer fit into this picture . " You know , Kassam think they ’re starting to realize that the New York set , they ’re not their friends , " the Republican National Committee, its former chairman Reince Priebus, and Sean Spicer replied . " I think in a weird strange alliance the Republican National Committee, its former chairman Reince Priebus, and Sean Spicer the RNC the Republican National Committee, its former chairman Reince Priebus, and Sean Spicer are realizing they ’re basically going to become allies with Bannon . " " This is all on the fly the RNC folks This is all really the last 24 hours , " he added . " If the other guys win , I guarantee you Bannon ’s out , Reince Bannon out , Spicer ’s out , the corporate New York set is Bannon . " " I think you ’re Bannon to see , internally , really kind of what I think are strange alliances . But in the short term , I think they ’re going to be working together to push back on this New York set . Quite frankly strange alliances even though it pains me somewhat to say this , the corporate New York set the RNC guys , that alliance is successful , " Ryun said .
