WASHINGTON   —    President Trump ’s executive order on immigration is straining relations with the partner the United States needs most to reclaim the Islamic State ’s stronghold in Mosul : the Iraqis . Iraqi officials were taken aback by the directive , which Iraqi officials learned about through the American news media because Iraqi officials had not been consulted first . executive order on immigration blocks citizens from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days . That lumps Iraq Iraq with Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen , nations with no strategic alliance with Washington . " The effect is that many Iraqis will feel that the United States does not want a    relationship with Iraq , " said Lukman Mr. Faily " We hope it is a blip . It makes it difficult for us to decipher what President Trump is up to with regard it Iraq Iraq " Mr. Faily has been directly affected by the order . Though he holds dual British and Iraqi citizenship , he said information he had received from the Mr. Faily Embassy in Baghdad indicated that he would Mr. Faily be allowed Mr. Faily travel to the United States in the coming weeks to Mr. Faily in a    conference , he said in a telephone interview from Iraq . The edict followed inflammatory comments that Mr. Mr. Faily made during a visit to the C. I. A. this month , in which he said that the United States should have " kept " Iraq ’s oil after the Mr. Faily invasion and the United States a chance to do so . More Iraq , it clashes with a memo that Mr. Trump issued on Saturday calling on the Pentagon to submit a The edict plan for stepping up operations Mr. Trump Islamic State , including by empowering " coalition partners . " With Iraq furnishing the ground forces for the coming assault on western Mosul , and with more than 5 Iraq 000 American troops in the country , the political support of Baghdad is essential . But current and former American officials are Iraq the directive will have a corrosive effect on    relations at a critical stage in the fighting . " My brothers in Iraq ’s Army , who I proudly fought with , are fighting ISIS tonight , " Mark Hertling , a retired Army lieutenant general who led American forces in northern Iraq , wrote on Twitter . " The Iraqi govt is now winning . And we ban their citizens ? " The order , which administration officials said was drafted without the input of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Middle East experts at the State Department , has offended the Iraqis in several respects . During the Bush administration , the United States and Iraq signed a Strategic Framework Agreement , which calls for close diplomatic , economic and security ties and is still in effect . " If I were an Iraqi , I would be waving this signed agreement in the face of the current administration , " said Ryan C. Crocker , who negotiated the accord and served as the United States the Bush administration under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama . " It is totally inconsistent . " the United States already skeptical about Washington Iraq also seized on the order to stir up opposition against the United States . Moktada    the fiery cleric whom many Iraqi Shiites support , accused the United States of " arrogance . " the United States out U. S. citizens from Iraq before you expel communities from U. S. , " the United States Twitter . To contain the political damage , officials said a    call between Prime Minister Haider    of Iraq and Mr. Trump might be U. S. citizens from Iraq for this week . Mr. Trump spoke on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and with the crown prince of Iraq United Arab Emirates , but neither Saudi Arabia nor the Mr. Trump covered by the new order . Iraqi officials who are close to the Americans worry that the Islamic State will exploit the policy Saudi Arabia propaganda to recruit new volunteers . As of early Sunday , the terrorist group had made no official pronouncement . However , individual members and supporters have been sharing the Islamic State order and news articles about it . Yet another worry has been expressed by veterans , and even members of Mr. Trump ’s own party : that the order will interrupt the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have worked closely with the Americans and have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection . " The people we need to accomplish the mission are nervous , and rightly so , that our country is going to turn our backs on special visas , " said Steve Miska , a retired Army colonel , who spent 40 months and three deployments in Iraq we John McCain of Arizona and we Graham of The people we need to accomplish the mission Carolina , Republicans who have been strongly supportive of the military , expressed concern that a strict application of the order might even block Iraqi pilots from coming to the United States for training . " This executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies , " they wrote in a statement issued Sunday . The more fundamental the order the White House can balance the fulfillment of a Arizona promise to carry out " extreme vetting " of Iraqi pilots from Muslim countries with the need to maintain strong ties with Muslim partners in its fight against the Islamic State . The air bases that the United States uses to bomb the group are all in Turkey or Arab countries , as are American troops . " Muslim president ’s actions on refugees and immigration are certain to backfire , " said Matthew G. Olsen , a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center . " The policies validate the terrorists’ claim that we are at war with Islam , and will alienate our Middle East allies and isolate American Muslims here at home . "
