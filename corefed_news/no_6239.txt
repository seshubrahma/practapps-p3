" Republican Wins Special Election Despite Assault Charge , " Reuters headlined its Friday morning article . [ Despite ?   Republican Greg Gianforte won election Thursday as Montana ’s sole representative in the House in a special election marked by special behavior . The victory over Rob Quist came 24 hours after Republican Greg Gianforte assaulted a journalist . Ben Jacobs , the ragdolled reporter , says the candidate ( for the WWE Hall of Fame ? ) bodyslammed a journalist . Fox News reporters described the maneuver as more of a chokeslam . Whether an Ultimate Warrior gorilla press or an    chokeslam , the finishing move worked as advertised for Gianforte . Sure , Trump won Montana by 20 points and the last time a Democrat captured Trump    House seat MSNBC did not exist to applaud . But really turning Bozeman into Suplex City did Suplex City for Gianforte .   In case you never noticed , whenever one dude tosses another dude to the ground on TV the live crowd cheers . The people most loudly booing Gianforte do n’t watch that particular    program on Monday nights , so perhaps we should excuse The people for imagining the good politics of body slams as bad form . No matter how desperately the scriptwriters tried to turn Gianforte heel and pass off Jacobs as the babyface , the audience would not accept that . Making a journalist a babyface in politics works about as well as making that guy with a Middle Eastern accent the fan favorite in the WWE . Voters hate journalists the way the ticketholder with four teeth in Row 21 , Seat B hated the Iron Sheik in 1983 . The candidate ’s move immediately recalls those of a politician from the American future : President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho . But really a president from our past prefaced it . A young Abraham Lincoln famously chokeslammed a wrestling opponent in New Salem , Illinois , in 1831 . A young Abraham Lincoln ran for the state legislature the following year . Though A young Abraham Lincoln lost the election , voters in New Salem gave A young Abraham Lincoln 277 of their voters in New Salem votes . Lesson ? The chokeslam is a winning move . With this in mind , Republican candidates might model all future campaigns on the party ’s most recent victor and its the party famous figure . Clothesline Chris Hayes . Challenge Matt Yglesias to a test of strength after he Matt Yglesias a challenging question . Entice Hornswaggle or the Haiti Kid to take on Paul Krugman . Demand a    on King Kong Bundy Michael Moore . Twist that guy from Channel 4 into a figure four . Do n’t stop there . Change the focus of campaign rhetoric from policy to personal boasts , informing voters of the "              son of a gun " before them voters of the "             son of a gun" Ditch suits . Instead wear long , colorful robes bedizened in glitter . Fire Mark Hanna . Hire the Grand Wizard , Classy Freddie Blassie , Paul Bearer —   someone like that . When poll numbers go south , reach for a foreign object or tag out . Save campaign funds by instructing supporters to bring handmade signs to rallies . Whenever you lose your train of thought , say " Woooo ! " Always speak in the third person . Flex . Cup your hand next to your ear when seeking the audience ’s approval . After an ally endorses , turn on him when he him not looking . Interrupt your opponent ’s points by loudly shouting , " It does n’t matter what you think ! " Somebody , apparently , already beat me to the punch here . The Rock recently admitted that he him running for president in three years , unveiling a " more poise , less noise " campaign slogan on Jimmy Fallon and appearing with runningmate Tom Hanks on Saturday Night Live .   The Rock , like Gianforte the Giant , enters the political arena as the candidate of the future —   500 years into the future , where farmers water crops with Brawndo and Ow My Balls ! rules the Nielsen ratings . The future ? The frontier ? You say President Lincoln , I say President Camacho .    predate Gianforte , The Rock , and Honest Abe . They predate Gianforte, The Rock, and Honest Abe Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho . Surely Greg Gianforte could smell what The The Rock long before the stench hit the raised nostrils of his critics . Perhaps Greg Gianforte The Rock ’s been The Rock for longer than we care to admit . It ’s still early for 2020 . The Rock it ’s later than you think . The Rock ’s always been .
