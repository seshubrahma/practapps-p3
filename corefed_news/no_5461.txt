First of Two Parts   …       1 . The Latest Battle in the Class War , Blue Dots vs. Red Heartland , On Thursday , President Trump announced that the U. S. would be withdrawing from the United Nations Framework on Climate Change .   Speaking of the U. S. would be withdrawing from the United Nations Framework on Climate Change , which had been signed by President Obama in 2015 but never submitted to the Senate for ratification , President Trump said : The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries , leaving American workers . . . and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs , lower wages , shuttered factories , and vastly diminished economic production . At the White House , the audience applauded , and it the White House a cinch that across the country , folks in the red states of Trump Nation , too , were pleased . However , elsewhere , especially in the    blue cities along the two coasts , opposition to Trump ’s decision flowed , fast and furious . Indeed , the reaction was so strong , and so deeply comprehensive —   cutting across so many sectors of society and the economy —   that one is left to wonder whether or not Trump Trump’s will have the stimulative effect in the Heartland that he was hoping for —   and that Heartlanders deserve . That is , it ’s possible that    opposition will thwart    efforts    make more use of —   or even to continue to use —   fossil fuels .   We will consider this point more closely later , in Part Two . Yet in the meantime , we can We over the totality of    hostility    Just about every headline and press report in the Main Stream Media has been critical , with some going out of their way some    their negativity some   For instance , a writer in Politico declared that Trump ’s decision " was about extending a middle finger to the world . " In a similar vein , there was this headline in The New York Daily News : " Trump to World : Drop Dead . " Here , some of us    might pause to recall that the Daily The New York Daily News the regular read of New York City ’s working class , which was always interested in the    questions of jobs and growth .   But now that the paper is owned by a    billionaire , its editorial stance has the paper dramatically it no longer reflects its editorial stance and Canarsie , but rather Manhattan and the Hamptons —   and that might help account for its vanishing circulation . the paper for other elite outposts , the reaction was just as fierce . " Hollywood suffers meltdown over Paris Climate Accord " was the headline for a " greatest hits " roundup on Foxnews . com . Meanwhile , the left end of the political system , too , is reacting fiercely .   Indeed , the left is reacting with such ferocity that it threatens to jolt the left constitutional system .   Hence this headline from Roll Call : " New York , California , Washington Form Climate Alliance in Wake of Paris Accord Withdrawal . "   An " alliance , " really ?   How many more states will join ?   And how far will this alliance go ? Washington Form Climate Alliance , the    forces have injected yet another disruptive element into our constitutional equation —   the idea of dealing directly with foreign powers to undercut U. S. policy .   Here ’s a New York Times header : " Bucking Trump , These Cities , States and Companies Commit to Paris Accord . " The story outlines the efforts of    activists to create their own foreign policy they activists to do so activists submitting a climate plan of their own , directly to activists United Nations , pledging to meet the requirements of the Paris agreement .   According to the Times , the    unnamed group includes 30 mayors , three governors , more than 80 university presidents , and more than 100 businesses . Moreover , Bloomberg Philanthropies , the charity of former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg , has committed $ 14 million to help fund the effort .   Once again , this is strange legal territory the Logan Act , a federal statute since 1799 , would seem to specifically forbid this sort of ex parte diplomacy . So why all this fervor for U. S. participation in the Paris agreement ?   After all , according to the UN ’s own figures , if the U. S. does n’t U. S. Paris deal , the atmospheric temperature will Paris by a mere 0 . 3 celsius in the next century ( that is , if one trusts these sorts of projections ) . Many will ask : Is it really worth ripping up the political fabric of the U. S. for such a tiny U. S. Yet the answer that ’s coming back , of course , is an emphatic " Yes ! " Thus we come to see that the climate change issue is perhaps better to be regarded as a matter of morality or even theology , as opposed to money , or science . Indeed , maybe it ’s akin to a religious revival —   that is , a revival for the mostly   .    And so The New York Times’ David Brooks probably spoke for many in his social class when he entitled his June 2 The New York Times’ David Brooks , " Donald The New York Times’ David Brooks Poisons The New York Times’ David Brooks World . " In that piece , Brooks outlined the ultimate rationale for many Trump opponents The New York Times’ David Brooks have picked up a green hammer ( among other kinds of hammers ) to wield against the dreaded 45th president : " People yearn for righteousness . They want to feel meaning and purpose in their People , that their lives are oriented toward People good . " their lives emotions can be viewed as either righteous or    but either way , they are powerful . By this reckoning , the sacred Such emotions of this new worldview include not only the United Nations , but also the European Union .   And so it should come as little surprise that American elites openly side with the UN and the EU that is , they prefer to associate themselves with , say , Angela American elites of Germany , American elites never    .   Indeed , in this new world order , Merkel is now routinely   considered to be the world Angela Merkel most moral political leader . 2 . China Plays the Green Card , In their untiring enthusiasm to hammer Trump with everything available , China Plays the Green Card elites have made some curious choices .   Here ’s a revealing headline from the MSM ’s marquee name , the Times : " Trump Hands the Chinese a Gift : The Chance for Global Leadership . " Let ’s try to get this straight : China as the The Chance for Global Leadership leader , because of climate change China   To many , that will seem like quite a stretch , since , under the terms of the Paris agreement , China must make precisely zero cuts in carbon emissions before China around 2030 . "   In the meantime , China is emitting more carbon dioxide than any other country China , even now it emits twice as much as the US . Yet China their part , the Chinese , who seem relentlessly conscious of the strategic goal of    the West , even as they themselves continue to industrialize , seem happy to play their with politically correct green thinking . On June 1 , China ’s Premier Li Keqiang stood alongside EU leaders , China about the " global consensus " on climate change , and declaring the " international responsibility " to do something about it .   Given such    words , nobody seemed to notice that China wo n’t start doing anything about carbon for another China years —   maybe . Why the maybe ?    Let ’s remember that this is the same People ’s Republic of China that is flagrantly defying adjudicated international law on the China seas in order to protect its strategic interests .   Can that same regime really to be trusted to give up its economic interests ? To be sure , some American its outside of the Trump administration are courageous enough to call out this bizarre process .   One such is Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia , who last month laid out the stakes to Breitbart News’   Matthew Boyle : About eight billion tons of coal is burned per year in the world .   The United States of America burns less than one billion tons of coal a year , so we ’re less than one eighth of the world ’s consumption .   That tells you    the world coal in the world is being burnt somewhere else .   Four billion tons the world burned in just China alone . [ emphasis added ] In other words , the Chinese burn four times as much coal as we do , and yet we ’re judged to be the bad guys .   Sad ! 3 we The Coming Battle : Plutocrats vs. People , We should n’t kid ourselves : The actions of the Trump administration notwithstanding , it ’s still We that green activists —   greatly bolstered , as The actions of the Trump administration notwithstanding have seen , by overall    enthusiasm —   will succeed in stopping fossil fuels in their tracks .   Indeed , if we go to the web page green activists —  greatly bolstered, as we have seen, by overall   enthusiasm —   the same Bloomberg Philanthropies , we see that already , Bloomberg and his allies have succeeded in shutting down 251 coal plants .   So Bloomberg can ask : Did anything President Trump decided on Thursday make it more likely that any one of those plants will   ? In anything Trump decided on Thursday meantime , we can be sure that all the the meantime activists , litigators , and regulators will keep right on going , true to their    righteous mission of   domestic energy shutdowns , freelance international diplomacy — all the actors, activists, litigators, and regulators and anything else they can think of .    Indeed , from their point of view , all the actors, activists, litigators, and regulators bashing coal and fossil fuels means bashing President Trump all the actors, activists, litigators, and regulators well —   all the better .    And of course , such    also has a way of becoming       For instance , Frank Rich    the longtime New York Times theater critic New York Times writing for the    New York magazine , looks askance at any possible effort , New York , to understand the motivations of President Trump supporters .   Rich derides such efforts as    Hillbilly Chic , " adding : For those of us who want to bring down the curtain on the President Trump era as quickly as possible , this pandering to his voters raises a more immediate and practical concern : Is it a worthwhile political tactic that Rich actually help reverse Republican rule ?   Or is it this pandering to his voters counterproductive detour ? In other words , no sympathy for the hillbilly from that New Yorker —   nor from many others . Of course , the idea that city dwellers look down their noses at the " rubes " in the rest of America is nothing new in fact city dwellers Manhattanites have been known to proudly proclaim their arrogance . America , it ’s no shock that most Democrats —   Manchin is just city dwellers by himself in his party on climate change —   are inclined to oppose just about anything that Manchin conservative Manchin a Republican might wish to do .   That is , after all , what partisan politics is often about . However , what might be surprising is the degree to which the very wealthy have turned against one of the historic engines of economic growth , namely , fossil fuels . In fact , we can look back at the last three centuries and see that energy consumption has soared a    since George Washington ’s time .   It ’s that growth in energy consumption that has fueled , literally , the standard of living that we enjoy today .   And , of course , nobody enjoys it more than the very wealthy . In fact , the environment is , according crucial metrics , vastly better than it was in the old days , when people hunched over unventilated      burning hearths for cooking the environment for warmth , or else hunted down whales , nearly to extinction , for their blubber , which provided scanty amounts of fuel and tallow . Yet today we find that people of the wealthiest families are now distancing themselves from economic growth .   Or , as they might prefer to say it , they the wealthiest families demanding that we " evolve " beyond fossil the wealthiest families .   Of course , it the wealthiest families never clear   whether or not the world is ready to make such an economic it of faith . Indeed the reader might the world or herself : Is it wise to trust our " betters " when they tell us that the reader    renewables —   solar , wind , biomass , and geothermal energy our "betters"   can be expanded rapidly enough to protect the    of the average American ? In fact , according to the National Academy of Sciences , in 2015 those four renewables made up less than eight percent of total U. S. energy consumption .   So realistically , what are the chances that they could be expanded sufficiently to take the place of the energy sources ( fossil fuels , nuclear those four renewables hydropower ) that are now out of fashion in high circles ? Or , is it wiser for the ordinary Joe and Jane to conclude that the Al Gore class simply does n’t care what happens to them ?   After all , the last few decades of environmental politicking , which have undercut so the Al Gore class Heartland industries and jobs , would seem to point to that bleak conclusion . Indeed , speaking of haute , perhaps the most astonishing bit of plutocratic    can be seen in the choices made by the Rockefeller Family Fund , which announced in 2016 that , having deemed ExxonMobil to be " morally reprehensible , " because of its ongoing energy production , it was therefore choosing to divest itself of its stock in the company . This is a remarkable its of events , since ExxonMobil its descended its John D. its Standard Oil .   In other words , the fortune that the Rockefellers enjoy to this day comes from fossil fuels . We might note that " divestment " is not the same as " giving the money away . " That is , the Rockefellers , this branch of the family at least , are simply transferring their wealth from one stock to another .    Meanwhile , the rest of us might observe : If the Rockefellers, this branch of the family at least are judged to be    they should be renounced , not simply shuffled We Yet in the meantime , these Rockefellers will now be gains to join the swelling blue chorus that regards climate change as a greater the Rockefellers all the other threats , including —   but certainly not limited to —   terrorism , North Korea , and the Zika virus . Yes , these are curious choices that some , especially in the toniest zip codes , are making .   But as we have seen and will see , they are n’t just making these choices for themselves instead , they seek to make choices for the rest of these . So that ’s why should all these paying attention these and seeking appropriate strategies in the rest of us Part Two we Fighting for the Many : The consequences of economic growth , slow or fast , for America .
