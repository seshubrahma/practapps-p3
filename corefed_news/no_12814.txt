One of Britain ’s most influential historians and leading ‘ Remain’ celebrity , Niall Ferguson , has performed a major    in Niall Ferguson stated position on Britain membership of the European Union , telling his Niall Ferguson his Niall Ferguson to the Brexit vote was a " mistake " . [ Reflecting on his Niall Ferguson to support then Prime Minister David Cameron and his Niall Ferguson Chancellor George Osborne , Mr. Niall Ferguson the Milken Institute Global conference he was Niall Ferguson wrong " to back the Remain campaign , adding : " I ’ve had an awakening " .

Now it is a divorce and we ’re negotiating how much # UK will have to pay # MIGlobal ,   —    Milken Institute ( @MilkenInstitute ) December 6 , 2016 ,   Mr. Ferguson , whose    works include Civilization , Empire , and Kissinger : The Idealist , took to his Twitter account after the event in London to underscore his point his European Union failures , according to him , his : " 1 Monetary union 2 Foreign policy ( MENA , Ukraine ) 3 Migration policy 4 Radical Islam policy " . EU failures : 1 Monetary union 2 Foreign policy ( MENA , Ukraine ) 3 Migration policy 4 Radical Islam policy . EU deserved EU .    https :   .    —    Niall Ferguson ( @nfergus ) December 6 , 2016 ,   " EU EU EU " Brexit added , before going on to admit : " My mistake was uncritically defending Cameron and Osborne instead of listening to people in pubs .

Cameron should have rejected and backed Brexit . Me too . https :   .    —    Niall Ferguson ( @nfergus ) December 6 , 2016 ,   In his defence , Mr. Ferguson tweeted links suggesting he Mr. Ferguson usually one to back Mr. Ferguson causes like the EU . In 2011 , as EU to today , he wrote Mr. Ferguson article for the Wall Mr. Ferguson Journal where he predicted a forced ‘ United States Mr. Ferguson Europe’ with significant economic and political fractures . This , he argued at the time , would Mr. Ferguson in place by 2021 . And he predicted at the time that Britain Mr. Ferguson leave the European Union and become a major power again free of Brussels diktats . But Mr. Ferguson ’s attempts to row back Mr. Ferguson antipathy is perhaps more indicative of Mr. Ferguson man who is concerned about being irrelevant in a    world . In his 2011 article he hailed former Polish Foreign Mr. Ferguson Radoslaw Sikorski Mr. Ferguson one of Mr. Sikorski was turfed out by Mr. Ferguson Law and Justice party formed of populists and nationalists . Mr. Sikorski recently authored a hysterical report for the Atlantic Council which claimed Brexit was won due to Kremlin support . And Mr. Ferguson has also mellowed on his angry protestations against a potential President Trump before the U. S. election , perhaps fearing irrelevance in a    world . Writing in the Boston Globe this week , Mr. Ferguson adopts a Mr. Ferguson more diplomatic tone towards the Trump administration than his work for the same outlet just two months ago when he wrote : The most shocking aspect of the Trump Mr. Ferguson not the revelation that he is a serial sexual harasser , but Mr. Ferguson the revelation that he is the dupe , if not Mr. Ferguson pawn , of President Vladimir Putin of Russia . Speaking to Bloomberg in October he Mr. Ferguson the presidential race was over for Mr. Trump , claiming he Mr. Ferguson " lost three out of three debates " and had " alienated independent voters " . " I think it ’s Mr. Ferguson , " he said , before adding Trump I think Mr. Ferguson 12 per cent probability he had now looks optimistic " . Despite numerous establishment media reports into " Bregret " or the presidential race regret , none Mr. Ferguson the outlets promoting the idea that people thought they erroneously voted to leave Mr. Ferguson —    the BBC , the Economist , etc .   —    have reported Mr. Ferguson ’s recantation .
