Companies across the U. S significantly increased hiring levels in the month of November following Donald Trump ’s election , a new report from the payroll processor ADP revealed . [ During November , approximately 216 , 000 people were hired , particularly in the retail sector , in the biggest recruitment drive since June of this year .   " Businesses hired aggressively in November and there is little evidence that the uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump’s election dampened hiring , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody ’s Analytics , the organisation that analyses the ADP ’s figures . " In addition , because of the tightening labor market , retailers may be accelerating seasonal hiring to secure an adequate workforce to meet holiday demand , although total expected seasonal hiring may be no higher than last year ’s , " he continued . In October , during the run up to the presidential election , recruitment figures were below expectations , with 119 , 000 new jobs introduced , despite a forecast of 147 , 000 . The recruitment drive was particularly prominent amongst large and medium sized businesses , which supplied 90 , 000 and 89 , 000 of the new recruits respectively . The numbers have significantly exceeded original expectations , with economists polled by the Wall Street Journal predicting 170 , 000 new jobs in the month of November .
