The Nation magazine sports editor Dave Zirin accused Donald Trump Saturday on MSNBC ’s " AM Joy " of telling San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to go back to Africa when the GOP presidential nominee suggested Colin Kaepernick should find a different country to live in if the GOP presidential nominee is upset with America .   Zirin told host Joy Reid , " The idea it ’s okay for Donald Trump to go across America bashing the United States , yet for Colin Kaepernick just to say , ‘ Wait a minute , we have a problem with police accountability,’ and he the GOP presidential nominee somehow the person who then Donald Trump Donald Trump say effectively , go back to Africa . He the GOP presidential nominee find yourself another country to live in then . It says something about who really has the right to have dissent in this country America does n’t . I think Colin Colin Kaepernick what he ’s Colin Kaepernick , is he ’s Colin Kaepernick so many of the hypocrisies that underline how we view free speech in this country , how America dissent in this country we how we America is allowed to speak we in this country .
