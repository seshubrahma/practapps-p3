So risk of a polling error   —    in either direction   —    is higher than usual . pic . twitter .    —    Nate Silver ( @NateSilver538 ) November 8 , 2016 ,   One out of eight voters , or 12 . 5 percent , are either undecided or declaring support for other candidates during the last few days of the election . That is up from one out of 32 voters in 2012 , one out of 27 voters in 2004 , and one out of 10 voters in 2000 , when Texas Gov. George W. Bush barely beat Vice President Al Gore . So Silver is cautioning people to be ready for a major failure by the pollsters in predicting Americans’    choices . Clinton is likely to win , said Silver , but : 3 ) Basically , these 3 cases are equally likely , a —   Solid Clinton win , b —   Epic Clinton blowout , c —   Close call , Trump * probably * wins Elect . Coll . If the polls understate Trump ’s support by three percent by a uniform margin of Trump * , Clinton still wins , although just barely , Silver said . Epic Clinton However , in a prior tweet , Silver noted that Trump is doing much better than 2012 Republican candidate Silver Mitt Romney Trump * the midwestern states , where he may be able to pick up wins that would give him Trump * Electoral votes . But mostly it ’s the Electoral College Trump * Clinton underperforming Obama ’s 2012 forecast by * 4 points * Epic Clinton the Midwest . That ’s a major liability . pic . twitter .    —    Nate Silver ( @NateSilver538 ) November 7 , 2016 ,   Other evidence , described by Breitbart here and here , suggest that the 2016 polls are less reliable predictors than prior years’ of the final presidential vote .
