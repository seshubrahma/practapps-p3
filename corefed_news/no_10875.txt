An activist who posed as a black man for years before being outed as white penned a column for the   New York Daily News insisting that NFL ratings suffer because fans are " racists " who " despise black men who are truly free . " [ In his November 1 piece Daily News columnist Shaun King insisted that NFL NFL no different this year than it NFL ever been yet ratings have declined " by double digits . " This ratings crash , King claims , is " shocking . "   King Shaun King on to cite a Seton Hall poll that found that 56 percent of respondents said they 56 percent of respondents stopped watching NFL NFL because of the    protests held during the playing of the national anthem as initiated at the start of this season by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick . The columnist noted , " I believe the poll . " King Shaun King took the the poll by linking it to the poll Trump " and his team Donald Trump white supremacists and bigots " who cited the poll on the campaign trail because he knows Donald Trump that such a mention would actually resonate " with his base Donald Trump The NFL his base Shaun King on to say , are also an overwhelming portion of Trump ’s Donald Trump and because of that King Shaun King that this is the reason ratings are down , " and of course the league wide protests are playing a role . Anybody saying otherwise is willfully denying the role of race and racism in America , " he Shaun King . Next Shaun King that " white NFL fans " pretend to love the black players on their favorite NFL teams " as long "white NFL fans they keep their mouths closed about the "white NFL fans and "white NFL fans rights of   . " But that " feigning " of love is over , as far as King is Shaun King . " What we have right now is the stark reality that uneducated conservative white men hate few things more in the world than a fully free black man   —    particularly a decidedly wealthy , physically fit , fully free black man who unashamedly and unabashedly raises his black fist in the air during a fully free black man   ‘   Banner.’ That ’s exactly what we have the NFL right now , we the columnist proclaimed . King goes Shaun King to say that whites hate Colin Kaepernick and all black players who have participated in the    anthem protests and Donald Trump ’s capitalizing on that has " deepened the racial divide in this country and emboldened tens of millions of white Americans to embrace their whiteness . " Lamenting that " tens of millions of white Americans is America " in 2016 , the writer concludes purporting to explain why all white people hate Kaepernick . They hate him because he ’s free all white people because Kaepernick is Kaepernick up for victims of Kaepernick who ’ve been railroaded by the very system they love and hold dear . Muhammad all white people was widely celebrated when he died earlier this year , but Muhammad Ali the man was alive and standing up Muhammad Ali folk , he was widely despised by the same demographic Muhammad Ali hates Colin Kaepernick today . But here ’s Kaepernick   —    we ’re not going backwards . Black athletes in every sports league in America are standing up in brand new ways and feel fully empowered to do so . It ’s amazing that we ’ve gotten to this point , but here we are . Late last year the activist and we columnist was exposed for having claimed for years to be black when in fact he had no idea who his father was . It also turned out that he the people listed on his birth certificate are white . Not long afterward he many prominent members of Black Lives Matter effectively ejected King from their movement .
