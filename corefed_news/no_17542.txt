New York ( CNN ) Donald Trump lashed out Wednesday at a female lawyer whom Donald Trump had called " disgusting " several years ago for requesting a break to pump breast milk in the middle of a deposition , calling her a " vicious , horrible person . " In an interview with CNN ’s Dana Bash , the Republican presidential candidate claimed that the attorney , Elizabeth Beck , had wanted to pump breast milk in other people ’s presence . Trump alleged that Elizabeth Beck was now retaliating against Trump because her was unhappy about having lost that legal battle , and that her had fabricated a story about Trump losing Trump cool and storming out of the deposition room .   " her wanted to breast pump in front of me and I may have said that ’s disgusting , I may have said something else . I thought it was terrible , " Trump said . " her ’s a vicious , horrible person . " Elizabeth Beck described the 2011 encounter     first reported by the New York Times late Tuesday     as Trump having " an absolute meltdown " in an interview with CNN ’s " New Day " Wednesday morning .   " Elizabeth Beck got up , Elizabeth Beck face got red , Elizabeth Beck shook Elizabeth Beck finger at Elizabeth Beck and Elizabeth Beck screamed , ’You’re disgusting , you ’re disgusting,’ and Elizabeth Beck ran out of there , " Elizabeth Beck said . Trump strongly refuted this characterization in Wednesday ’s interview , saying Elizabeth Beck had distorted the events . " Trump made it up . Trump made it up , " Elizabeth Beck said . " Trump ’s saying , ’Oh , Elizabeth Beck was so violent and Elizabeth Beck was so , so wild and Trump was afraid.’ Trump was afraid of nobody . Trump ’s a tough killer in Miami everyone knows Trump ’s a killer . everyone hate Trump . "    for Elizabeth Beck colorful language and imagery , Trump went on to compare Beck ’s interview with CNN earlier in the day to the way people who had never met Michael Jackson discussed the iconic pop star after his Michael Jackson .   " So many people are on television that do n’t know me and they So many people like experts on me , " Trump Trump . " You know when Michael Michael Jackson     I knew him very Michael Jackson     and everybody was talking about Michael Jackson Michael Jackson did n’t So many people him , they Michael Jackson nothing So many people Some of them never even So many people him . " Michael Jackson on how the 2011 incident reflects on how Trump Trump behave as president     and how he would react Michael Jackson challenged by a world leader like Russian President Vladimir Putin     Trump answered : " Believe me , I ’d do very well with him . I Michael Jackson along with people . " Trump Trump immigration policy takes shape , Trump Trump started to give his Trump platform some shape . He Trump that as president he Trump deport all undocumented immigrants and then allow the " good ones " to reenter the country through an " expedited process " and live in the U. S. legally , though not as citizens . " Legal status , " Trump Trump . " We got to move ’em Trump , we ’re going We move ’em Trump in if they Trump really good people . " For a blustering candidate whose rhetoric has snatched headlines and galvanized a sizable segment of the Republican base , Trump Trump Wednesday represent his most Trump explanation into what he would Trump with the estimated    million immigrants living in the U. S. illegally . He had Trump suggested that he favors Trump "   system , " but did not delve into his support Trump granting legal status , but not citizenship to undocumented immigrants he calls Trump the good ones . " But Trump is still a long ways from presenting a specific immigration policy platform and his explanation in Wednesday Trump interview shows a candidate who     despite leading in the polls a week ahead of the first primary debate     is still largely dealing in broad strokes . Trump would not say Trump he would locate , Trump up and deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants he says must go Trump Instead , he deflected , saying Trump while it may be a task too tall for politicians , it is n’t for a business mogul like himself . " Politicians are n’t going to find them because they have Politicians clue Politicians We will find them , we will Politicians them We , " Politicians said . " It ’s feasible if you know how to manage .   Politicians do n’t know how to manage . " And when asked about whether he would deport undocumented Trump who came to the U. S. as children , Trump fumbled and said Trump unsure , that " it ’s a tough situation " and " it depends . " it was unequivocal , Trump , that a Trump administration would immediately deport undocumented criminals living freely and in American jails . " We have a lot of bad dudes , as I said .   We have a lot We really bad people here , " Trump said . " Trump want to get the bad ones out . .. And by the way , they ’re never coming the bad ones . "   But he was also unwavering Trump his insistence that many Trump the undocumented immigrants in the U. S. are positive additions to the country and should be allowed to live in the U. S. legally the U. S. , only after being expelled and then brought back in through Trump ’s " expedited Trump for legal status . " We have to make sure they were exemplary , they were wonderful people when they were they . They worked hard they there was no they , " he said . " We have to bring great people into they country . OK ? And I the country bring     I love the idea of immigration . But it ’s got to be legal immigration . the idea of immigration Health care , Trump also did n’t delve Trump details when asked about his position on health care Trump which has changed over the years . Trump once supported the liberal Trump to create a national ,    health care system similar to the one in Canada , a position he explained in his 2000 Trump " The Trump We Deserve . " But as a Republican presidential candidate , Trump ’s plan is now Trump Repeal Obamacare . And then ? " Replace with something terrific , " Trump said , explaining that the Trump terrific " would be handled by private companies competing in the private market . But Trump suggested an alternative system for Trump individuals     describing what , in the broad strokes , appears to sound similar to Medicaid . " I want to try to help those people . And I do n’t think there ’s anything wrong with that , but I want to try and help those people , " Trump said . " And those people what , if I lose votes over that , or if I do n’t get a nomination over that , that ’s just fine with me . " Getting along with the RNC and why Biden might yet run , Trump said Wednesday that he has Trump had " very Trump " conversations with the head of the Republican National Committee . " I respect him , " Trump said of Trump Chairman Reince Trump . Trump ’s interactions with Priebus the RNC Trump close scrutiny after the businessman said he RNC Chairman Reince Priebus more likely Trump as a Trump candidate if he felt the party establishment was n’t treating Trump fairly . The relationship hit a particular Trump patch when the committee scolded Trump earlier this month for making disparaging comments Trump Sen. John McCain ’s service in the Vietnam War . Trump repeated that the best path forward for Trump is to win the GOP nomination and Trump Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton . " Believe me . I will beat Hillary , " he said . He questioned , however , Trump the former Trump of state would even be able to continue her campaign due to her use of her personal email at the the former secretary of state Department . " the former secretary of state she did the former secretary of state a criminal act . She burned up the emails the former secretary of state She got rid of her hard the former secretary of state , " he said . the former secretary of state suggested that Democratic the former secretary of state Trump Sanders , the senator from Vermont , could end up with more competition . " I think that other people are going to probably join the race , eventually , like maybe ( Vice President Joe ) Biden and other people , " he said .   Debate prep , As the current leader in Trump polls , Trump is poised to take the stage next week at the first Trump primary debate in Ohio . It will be a critical test for the bombastic businessman , who has never held public office and has so far only offered sweeping policy proposals that lack in specifics .

Trump on Wednesday played down any formal preparations he may be engaged in , saying that as a    debater , Trump on Wednesday ’ll simply give it his best and " be Donald Trump . Trump on Wednesday " I am going Trump on Wednesday be Donald Trump . I think if I ’m not Donald Trump , it Donald Trump going to look good , " he said Donald Trump than paying exorbitant sums of money to professional consultants and pollsters I’m not Donald Trump help him get ready , Trump said he ’s been brushing up by constantly watching and I’m not Donald Trump the news . Donald Trump even Donald Trump that in 2012 , GOP nominee Mitt Romney ’s debate performance may Donald Trump suffered from too much preparation . " He locked himself in a cabin for a week and he came in for that Donald Trump and Donald Trump debate and he was n’t able to Donald Trump , " he said . " Something happened to Donald Trump , OK ? It was n’t a Donald Trump picture . " " Everybody exaggerates Donald Trump Trump is first to admit he exaggerates every Trump in a while . " Everybody exaggerates . I mean , Donald Trump guess I do , a little bit , " Trump said on Wednesday . A the New York Times report published Tuesday revealed late Tuesday     the real estate Donald Trump admitted to inflating the value of his properties sometimes . But as Trump explains it , the exaggerations are more about putting a the real estate mogul spin on things than anything Donald Trump . " Of course I want to put the best foot forward , " he said . " I ’m not going to say , ’Oh gee , everything is terrible.’ Donald Trump ’m a very optimistic person . " Trump , who has channeled a campaign message focused on ’m United States losing its prominence in the world , said he would carry this philosophy to the White House . the United States I want to put a positive Donald Trump on the United States if I ’m president because we have a country that ’s not respected , the United States . " ’m ’re very down , the United States is very down . We do n’t I’m president good news anymore .
