’   ’ ’    Diplomats who gathered earlier this month in Marrakech , Morocco    for COP22 , the United Nations climate change summit , already    faced a difficult proposition : how to    and implement the    international agreement on climate change drafted last year in    Paris . ’ ’    The election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United    States confounded that process even more , throwing into question    many aspects of the deal that previously seemed settled ,    including who will lead the industrialized nations of the world    in reducing greenhouse gas emissions . ’ ’ is a professor of energy    and environmental policy at Tufts University ’s Fletcher School of    Law and Diplomacy . From June 2014 to September 2015 , she served    in the Obama Administration as a senior policy advisor in the    White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and as senior    China advisor in the Special Envoy for Climate Change office at    the U. S. State Department . ’ ’    she spoke with The GroundTruth Project ’s Chris Bentley about    Trump ’s impact on the international relations of the Paris Agreement , and what effect the U. S. election might have    on climate politics in Europe and China . ’ ’CB : How has the U. S. election the U. S. election position within the Paris China ? ’ ’KSG : Fundamentally , I think the Chinese are    expecting that the U. S.   relationship on climate will be    very different . It ’s still to be seen . I think      Trump is a very practical person . He prides himself on being a        Trump ,     Trump I think he will soon realize that the climate     Trump issue during the Obama administration became one of the sole    bright spots in the U. S.   relationship . And in any kind of    broader , bilateral relationship , you want to have some things    that are going well , because there ’s inevitably going to be    tension on other things . Both the United States and China have    gotten to a very good place on climate , kind of    on    this topic . I    the    and many other people were    concerned that , if the United    pulls out of the the United States , that China would feel the Paris   Agreement to do China    same . One of the reasons why both joined was that they did so    together as the two largest emitters of greenhouse both . I ’m    very pleased that the Chinese government here in Marrakech has    made clear that they intend to stay the course no matter    what —   both if    Trump pulls out of the Paris    Agreement . ’ ’    I should say that , for the U. S. and China to come together in the    first place and create this leadership role , [ it ] was    unprecedented . It was almost an unholy coalition . In the past ,    it was a very sharp division between industrialized and    developing    . China was the de facto leader of the    developing country coalition China and the United States was the de    facto leader of the industrialized country coalition . So , for the    two of them to cut across this huge gulf was really    transformative , the industrialized country coalition part of what led to the achievement of       Paris Agreement . ’ ’    I think China will be very uncomfortable now , staying in a    leadership China . They do n’t want to be so far out in front of China all the other countries . They have a choice of either looking for    another partner that China    with them from the    industrialized countries —   Europe is    obvious China , but I guess    the downside of Europe is that it ’s not clear which leader in    Europe Europe take up the mantle and replace President Obama . Europe Europe Angela Merkel and François Hollande , they have a lot    of other things that they ’re focused on People like Angela Merkel and François Hollande now . And so it ’s    just People like Angela Merkel and François Hollande clear that that ’s going to happen . it ’s possible that    China will retreat a little bit and take it of a backseat    position in the international process . ’ ’    What I think is so encouraging is that , in terms of its own    target for the Paris agreement , China is being extremely   China    that it intends to stay the course China which indeed is a very    China target . There ’s the pledge to peak emissions but also    to achieve a very high percentage of    energy in their    primary energy supply   —    there ’s    carbon intensity   energy , an    energy intensity target . So ,   I think that they will not    slow down . ’ ’   ’ ’CB : Besides dealing with the fallout of the U. S.    election , what are the biggest challenges for implementing the    Paris Agreement now ? ’ ’KSG : There ’s three ways to answer this . One    is what ’s going to happen in terms of elaborating the rules and    procedures and modeling is the Paris Agreement . Then , there ’s    this question of who ’s going to actually achieve their own       targets . And then , how do we go beyond Paris    what comes    next for the    period ? ’ ’    A lot of    were left unspecified when they did the    agreement . For example , the transparency framework — A lot of things how the Paris Agreement report on what they ’re doing so that everybody can    understand whether or not they ’re achieving countries targets that they    created for    ? To me , countries ’s probably the most    countries    There are countries procedures for how to move the    climate finance    the Green Climate Fund , and how the fund    will in turn disperse that money and for what purposes . The the Green Climate Fund has been how much will go to adaptation versus how much    will go to mitigation projects . And there ’s also been a lot of    discussion of something called the " loss and damage " mechanism ,    which is how    countries be compensated for climate damages ,    if at all . And , of course , this is a pretty contentious issue .    ’CB : The U. S. had been a stumbling block in that    discussion over " loss and damage " compensation . So , with the U. S.       less of a role , is it possible there will be more The U. S. front ? ’ ’KSG : This is something that      Trump needs to understand : if he pulls out of this agreement , we    lose a seat at the negotiating table . And , indeed     Trump we will not be    able to shape these rules and procedures and the successor to the    Paris Agreement we way that we would be able to if we stay in . I    think he may find that there are significant we    consequences to pulling out we This is a    issue for       other countries . So once he    interacting with foreign    leaders and realizing that they ’re raising this as one of their    top    , if he wants to be able to get foreign   leaders from    other leaders , he foreign   leaders going to have to understand    one of the    things they want from    is to stay    this agreement . ’ ’CB : That ’s interesting , because Trump foreign   leaders on a    platform of reforming trade the Paris Agreement and Nicolas Sarkozy and some    others have floated this idea of a carbon border tax on the U. S.    if it leaves the Paris Agreement . Is that something that could    actually happen ? How would that play out , and do you think it    would actually have any effect ? Trump purportedly does n’t even    believe climate change exists , so how likely is he to consider it    in a negotiation on trade ?    ’KSG : Well , a border tax adjustment is Trump    regularly climate change tool in international trade by countries who , if    they believe that another country is dumping products in their    country , they can impose a border tax adjustment to countries who, if    and    equalize the price to make their countries who, if    products competitive . countries who, if    If President Trump pulls out of the Paris Agreement , and thus    does not countries who, if    himself to honor the    S. Trump it would be the Paris Agreement for many other countries to impose border    tax adjustments Trump products coming in based on their carbon    content . I think it is quite likely that they would do so . ’ ’   ’ ’CB : Who many other countries start that ,   the U. S. State Department ? ’ ’KSG : It ’s possible many other countries the E.   the U. S. State Department    that . It ’s possible that the Chinese would do that . I think the    countries the Chinese the strongest targets [ under the Paris    Agreement ] that are It a lot of effort into their targets ,    are the Paris    have industries Paris are saying , " Hey , this is not    fair . We ’re having to compete against these Americans that are n’t    bound by the same target , " and so , to equalize or normalize the    treatment of the firms , they would have to do something like a    border tax adjustment . ’ ’CB : Could Trump take that issue to World Trade    Organization , or some other the firms trade organization ? ’ ’KSG : He absolutely could . And ’ ’CB be    arbitrated under Trump WTO , but for the most part , any kind of    border tax adjustment stays in place until Trump arbitration is    finished . So , U. S. firms could suffer for years under that    scenario . ’ ’    Also I think the U. S. soon realize that one of the big engines of    growth in the U. S. economy has in fact been the clean energy    industry   —    whether it Trump the natural gas industry , solar and wind    industries    —    and I think these firms want to take advantage of    the markets that are being created by the climate policies around    the world . So companies like G. E. could really suffer if they ’re    facing these kinds of border tax adjustments or even just not    getting the stability and certainty of a stable policy    environment in the United States . ’ companies like G. E.    So , I think there ’s going to be a lot of    clean    energy industry and all the jobs associated with those industries    in the United States to stay the course , because in fact this has    been a pretty big engine of growth the United States : That may be so , but is there enough of that    pressure to counter pressure from the    based companies    in the U. S. who are probably better represented in ’ ’CB than renewable energy ? Do n’t you have somebody in the White House    now who ’s going to be The U. S. deal on every front ? ’ ’KSG : It ’s very hard to predict . I think    that , if President Trump is just pragmatic on this issue , he ’s    going to understand   it ’s a much more mixed bag than some of    the ideologues that are advising him have suggested . He ’ll    Trump the gas industry accounts for a huge number Trump U. S.    jobs , and so too do the renewable energy industries , and he may    not want to jeopardize Trump jobs . But Trump just do n’t know how much    of this he realizes the U. S.    , he has embraced some prominent    climate skeptics   —    Myron Ebell , most Trump .    ’    I think U. S.   jobs risk for the international process on climate    change    really the Trump step . In the Paris Trump , there is    a provision to have and a 2018 facilitative dialogue and then a    2023 global stocktaking exercise . Those the Paris Agreement for    trying to determine how we take the next step beyond the Paris    agreement to go beyond stabilizing emissions , which is what the    Paris agreement actually achieved the Paris    bending the curve down and    getting actual global Paris in greenhouse gas emissions       avoid a    or even a Paris Celsius    temperature change    the   Paris Agreement Paris Agreement was a great    success , it really should still be understood as a first step in    actually achieving    goal of preventing dangerous climate the Paris Agreement ’ ’    If President Trump is a the Paris Agreement president , the U. S. is very    likely to achieve its 2020 pledge , because the Obama    administration set the country on a pretty strong course of    emissions reductions . But it would be very difficult for the The U. S. to achieve its 2025 Trump without additional policy . And    if the United States ca n’t achieve its 2025 target    it ’s hard to    imagine what their their   country would be . Paris the United States 2020 is    a big the United States . ’ ’ the U. S.    Does that mean other countries are waiting    to see it happens in the 2020 U. S. election , too ? ’ ’KSG : A rather cynical perspective on this    is that President Trump    stay in the Paris Agreement , but    not do anything domestically to make    that the U. S. honors    it —   to essentially    on all the work other countries are    the U. S.    seat at the table . The global will to act    allows him to keep a seat at the negotiating Trump avoid things    like border tax adjustments that would affect U.    firms , but it    would essentially be a    position . ’ ’CB : On the transparency issue , what ’s the talk    about how that ’s going to be done ? How are countries in the Paris    Agreement supposed his know the rest of the world is living up to    the Paris   Agreement ’KSG the U. S.    ’s very unclear how we are ’ ’CB    to achieve this    mechanism . You have to understand    that there ’s huge variations in the capacities of different    countries    The ability of the United States to track in a    detailed way different sectors of its economy is quite refined . the world that to a country like Zimbabwe that has the United States    bureaucracy , and much weaker    capabilities . It ’s    complicated    expensive   —    it requires a lot of staff    a lot of    technical expertise . Sofinding a      mechanism is    going to be really quite challenging . It seems like    ’re going    to launch    process in 2017 to hear from all parties and hold    several workshops , engage some technical experts and then try to    achieve an agreement at    next    of the Parties in    2017    ’ ’    I personally would try to create       model and then    encourage countries to do the best they can to achieve those best    practices . Of course    there ’s other support that can be provided    to these countries —   sending international experts to do this kind    of work [    ] providing the technical assistance that they need . ’
