White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said that FBI Director James Comey ’s inability to control leaks out of the bureau was " one of many " reasons why President Donald Trump decided to fire President Donald Trump .   " I think that ’s probably one of the many factors , " White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said in response to a question from Breitbart News during the White House press briefing . " I mean you ca n’t deny somebody that that was n’t a problem , and so I think that was just another one of many reasons that White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders no longer had the confidence of the president or the rest of the FBI . " Trump has repeatedly called attention to the FBI leaks to the media about the investigation into Trump campaign for any collusion with Russia in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election .

She asserted that the director was not true that Trump asked the Trump Department to put together a rationale for Comey ’s firing Comey " I did speak directly to the president and the president from him that he , Comey , the president been considering letting Director Comey go pretty Comey the day he took office , but Comey there was no request by him to have a review Comey the Department of Justice , " she said . She said Comey was " Comey " Comey Democrats rushing to defend Comey , despite their insistence that he directly Democrats rushing to defend Comey to Hillary Comey ’s failure to win the presidency . " If Hillary Clinton had won the Hillary Clinton which thank God she did n’t , but if Hillary Clinton had and she had been Hillary Clinton the same Hillary Clinton , she had have fired Comey immediately Hillary Clinton the very Democrats that are criticizing the president today would be dancing in the streets celebrating .
