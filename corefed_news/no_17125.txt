  ( CNN ) President Obama ’s top counterterrorism adviser said that President Obama believes the United States and the United States allies are winning the war against ISIS and that the incoming Trump team needs to guard against the possibility of terrorism during the early part of the administration . Lisa Monaco oversees a team of some 50 senior directors and other officials at the White House who are focused on counterterrorism , cybersecurity and homeland security . Lisa Monaco and Lisa Monaco team guide a wide range of American policies     from the fight against ISIS , to how to guard against hackers on key infrastructure in the States , to how to mitigate the effect of emerging diseases .   Lisa Monaco previously ran the National Security Division at the US Department of Justice , which is in charge of prosecuting terrorism and espionage cases , and before then Lisa Monaco was chief of staff at the FBI .   We sat down Thursday at the Defense One Summit in Washington to talk about the Trump transition and the fact that Trump " landing teams " have not been in touch as yet with Lisa Monaco or Lisa Monaco team the possibility that Guantanamo Bay will go back into service for suspected terrorists , including , perhaps , for American citizens and the possibility that coercive interrogations of terrorism suspects could be reinstituted .   Monaco gave Lisa Monaco assessment of the war against ISIS     the group is losing and badly in Lisa Monaco view      as well as how other jihadist groups are faring , including the continuing    threat posed by al Qaeda ’s affiliate in Syria , and what Lisa Monaco believes the next administration needs to worry about most , including the possibility of a terrorist attack early in the Trump presidency . We also discussed what the US intelligence community has determined to be Russian cyberattacks on elements of the American electoral system during the presidential campaign .   The discussion has been edited for both clarity and brevity : Peter Bergen : The Trump transition : Have The Trump transition been in touch with Peter Bergen ? Lisa Monaco : Not me personally . We are ready to carry out the President ’s directions . the President’s ’s been very clear with his the President’s that We are going to conduct a professional , smooth , comprehensive transition .    Peter Bergen : Given the fact that    Trump ’s campaign was very bound up with the issue of terrorism , is it campaign they campaign n’t been in touch with you yet ? After all you are the top counterterrorism official in the country .   Monaco : What ’s important to understand is there is a process put in place . It a process put in place now preserved in statute     the transition statute . There ’s a White House Transition Coordinating Council , of which I am a member , and we have had a number of meetings to facilitate the transition . Now that we we the    and his the    there are a number of steps they we have the   and his team to take to be ready to receive classified information , not only from the National Security Council but also across the government . No ( Trump ) " landing teams " have gone into any of these agencies while those final steps are being taken .   Bergen : The landing teams     they would need to have top secret clearances to be briefed ? Monaco : It will vary , depending on what type of information they they receiving , but certainly individuals who come into the the National Security Council the Defense Department , CIA , will have to have appropriate clearances in order to receive information .   Bergen : And you Bergen no idea who your successor may be ?   Monaco : I do Monaco .   Bergen : When you Bergen with him or her for your successor first Bergen , what are the most important pieces of advice , or warning , that you would give that person ?   Monaco : What ’s Monaco to be critical for my successor is to make sure you ’re focused on the very complex and    array of threats that we face today . It ’s everything from terrorist threats , cyber threats , emerging infectious diseases . It ’s an extremely It environment in which we ’re operating , and so I will be walking my successor through that my successor   But , broadly speaking , I ’ll also try to impart , the types of things I think they should be focused on things building a good team , making sure you ’re asking questions , trusting your instincts , and then , personally , I would instruct him or her to live my successor by because you ’re going to spend a lot of time in your office . And I would also advise that person to stock up on Vitamin D because , as you know , I occupy a windowless office in the West Wing of the White House , and when I ’m not there , I spend the rest of my time in a windowless Situation Room , so he or she will need that person get her with that . From Guantanamo to Mosul , Bergen : The Obama administration has not sent prisoners to Guantanamo at all , right Guantanamo Monaco : That ’s correct . Bergen : So , there ’s nothing preventing the new president from sending prisoners to Guantanamo , including American citizens Guantanamo potentially , as was discussed in the campaign ? Monaco : The    has Monaco on the campaign trail about keeping Guantanamo open . That ’s Guantanamo not President Obama ’s view , it ’s not this administration ’s view view , and from a policy perspective , there ’s nothing to stop the next administration from keeping Guantanamo open .   Bergen Guantanamo Right , and similarly with    enhanced interrogation techniques , sometimes referred to as torture , the new head of the CIA could bring back enhanced interrogation ? Monaco : As a policy matter , I suppose that ’s possible . President Obama issued an executive order     one of the first executive orders he issued     when he President Obama into office banning President Obama and banning enhanced interrogation techniques and taking the CIA out of the the CIA the CIA That structure was broadly codified in a statute last year . Bergen : But , presumably , you could find a lawyer in the White House to write a memo that said certain enhanced interrogation techniques did n’t rise to the level of torture . Monaco : That would n’t be a lawyer in the White House as a matter the White House practice . It would be a lawyer in the Justice Department in the Office of Legal Counsel , which opines on the definitive view of the law for the executive branch .                     Is ISIS winning ? Bergen : Some have claimed that ISIS is winning . What ’s your view ISIS Monaco : I disagree with that . Bergen : Because ? Monaco : I disagree Bergen that pretty profoundly Monaco actually , because , what has distinguished ISIL ( another acronym for ISIS ) is that it has operated as ISIS hybrid threat     ISIS insurgent army a terror group , directing attacks like we saw in Paris and in Brussels and as a social phenomenon , using social media to spew venom .   On all three dimensions , ISIL is absolutely losing . They ’re being rolled back from territory that ISIL used to occupy in Iraq and Syria ISIL losing some 50 % of the territory that they used to occupy . territory terrorist ISIL , they ’re on the run . The Defense ISIL has taken down a number of very senior leaders . And , in the social media space and in the messaging space , we have retooled our approach , whether it ’s with our    we or by engaging with the private we . Companies like Twitter have really scaled up their actions to stop ISIL from exploiting and abusing Companies like Twitter platforms . The numbers I ’ve seen recently Companies like Twitter over the last year , year and a half some 360 , 000 terrorist accounts , have been disrupted and taken down . That ’s 1 , 000 accounts per day . And places like Google are putting in place very kind of new and innovative ideas to redirect those who are searching for ISIL content to other content . So I think we ’ve got them on the run , for sure . Bergen those who are searching for ISIL content to other content Is the threat level here in the United States and also in Europe declining ? And also , with the transition and the new presidency      we saw    happened early in Bush ’s presidency and we saw the " underwear bomber " plot early we Obama ’s presidency     are you concerned about something happening in the early days of the new administration ?   Monaco : Well I ’m always concerned about something happening , and that ’s pretty much what I get paid for . But I think it ’s a fair question . And it ’s one of the reasons we are so it on a smooth and professional and comprehensive transition . Because , particularly in the national security , homeland security , counterterrorism space , there needs to be a clear transition of what we know and what we ’re doing and how we ’re going about we the fight to terrorists we We always have to be concerned . They are we focused on attacking the United States . We ’re all vulnerable to (   attacks ) and that is something we are very concerned about because it ’s much harder to We . How do you know when something goes wrong in somebody ’s head and will inspire them to act ? That person does n’t have to travel They get training and then travel back to conduct an attack .   Bergen : Clearly ISIS is in Bergen process of losing ( the Iraqi ISIS of ) Mosul it might be a few weeks away . What happens to the " foreign fighters " ( who joined ISIS from around the world ) who are n’t captured ISIS killed ? What is the plan ? Are some getting away ? Is the Turkish border really sealed ?   Monaco : We ’ve made a Monaco of progress on sealing and moving up the defenses on the Turkish border . The Turks themselves have taken a number the Turkish border . So I think the inflow of foreign fighters has been greatly diminished .   Bergen : What are the numbers Bergen you ’re seeing now ? Monaco : Monaco , the foreign fighter numbers are down considerably over the last year , year and a half . The height , I think , over the course of the conflict , some 40 , 000 fighters . But we ’ve seen over the last year a 50 % I believe , diminishment in the number of foreign fighters flowing into the theater .   Now your question is the concern of , well , who ’s flowing out ? And certainly we ’re concerned about ISIL moving south we ’re concerned about ISIL foreign fighters traveling ISIL and trying to flee we ISIL conduct attacks in Europe and then , ultimately , to here . I think Europe have a number of defenses . The first is the ocean that we us , so I do think Europe is more vulnerable when it comes we foreign fighter plots Europe as we have tragically seen in Paris and Brussels . The second is the we that Paris put Brussels place by both the Bush administration and this administration , to shore up our this administration Bush our screening mechanisms , our information sharing both within our country     amongst our law enforcement and homeland security and intelligence communities     and with our international foreign partners . I will be talking to my successor about continuing to focus on my successor relationship with our European partners , because that is critical .   Russia and the DNC hack , Bergen : Some have claimed that Bergen was n’t behind the hacks on the Democratic National Committee . What ’s your Russia ?   Monaco : We ’ve seen pretty Monaco that the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security spoke to this back in October , being quite clear that the intrusions and the compromises that we believe were directed by the highest levels of the Russian government . Then we the government to work with state and local governments and state and local administrators of we voting architecture and voting infrastructure in this country to shore up those systems as well . Bergen : The electoral system in this our country     Is it critical infrastructure like our power grid ? Should it be treated as such our country     an attack on The electoral system in this country will have a proportionate response , similar to The electoral system in this country attack on the power grid ? Monaco : I The electoral system in this country it should be treated Monaco such . And , in fact , we did so over the last six months as we ramped up for Election Day . Whether or not it is designated as critical infrastructure should not , we think , affect how we ’re treating it . The fact that it ’s not designated critical infrastructure does not impede what services we help that it can offer to state it local governments . And that ’s what we did with the    to the election .   Bergen : I want to throw out some Bergen we terrorist groups . Just give us a brief assessment of where they are : al Qaeda Central , the group that attacked us on we ? Monaco : Largely decimated . Spending more time thinking of their own Monaco than how we plan and plot against us . But still determined . Bergen : Al Monaco: Largely decimated in the Arabian Peninsula Bergen in Yemen , which we out the underwear bomb attempt ? Monaco : Al Qaeda ’s affiliate in Yemen , determined , persistent Monaco particularly when it comes to external operations and aviation plotting against the United Yemen . Bergen : Still ? Monaco : Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen . Bergen : They the United States key   Monaco Monaco : (   Ibrahim   ) is still , Monaco far as we know , in They . Bergen : Monaco: Largely decimated : We have to be concerned about that and that ’s Monaco operating assumption , but Yemen will say they have Monaco: Largely decimated under relentless pressure by our operations and in coordination with what we still believe to be the legitimate government in Yemen . I will other people say the turmoil and devastation that We happening there because of the internal We between the Houthis and Yemen has created a Yemen that AQAP has tried to exploit . Bergen : What about Nusra ( in Syria Bergen ? Are they playing a long Yemen Front renamed Syria Yemen Fateh    this year , but the US government continues to view it as an al Qaeda affiliate . ) Monaco : I ’m concerned they are trying to play a long Monaco . Nusra is in essence al Qaeda in Yemen now the largest al Qaeda Yemen . Bergen : How many people Syria Monaco : Bergen estimates really they , but the people I ’m Monaco concerned Nusra (in Syria) are the al Qaeda veterans who began a couple years Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen in al Qaeda the ungoverned space left by ( President Bashar   ’s ) brutality on Syria own people to have a space ’m plot and plan against the United States , which is why you saw in September of 2014 that we initiated military the United States out those leaders and to take out those plotters . This is President Bashar   area where I will focus with my successor . I will argue the next team should my successor about going after al Qaeda in Syria because we can not let them take advantage of the chaos in Syria to mount Syria long game against us .   Bergen : Are you concerned about Syria son Bergen ISIS or the grandson of ISIS ? After all , al Qaeda in Syria of al Qaeda in Iraq ? Monaco : the next team am because I am concerned about the underlying conditions that Monaco Iraq ISIL to take root . And really what that comes down to is grievances that are ISIL and ISIS sectarianism across the Middle ISIS , and until we address al Qaeda in Syria and until those governments can get a hold of those issues I worry greatly that we and our partners have a continued challenge on our hands , which is why President Obama has taken the last eight years to put in place a sustainable , transparent counterterrorism architecture that can Obama long game when it comes to fighting the terrorist fight .   Bergen : we question we What will you Bergen doing on we 21 , 2017 ? Monaco : Monaco .
