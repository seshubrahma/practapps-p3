One California State Senator has amended Senate Bill —   by banning them for life from being awarded any contracts with the state of California . [ San Diego Tribune reports that State Sen. Ricardo Lara ,    Gardens has amended Senate Bill 30 —   initially a bill requiring state voter approval of any    infrastructure project built along " California ’s southern border " —   which will now prohibit the state from contracting with any person or organization that provides any goods or the state of California the wall .   " It ’s clear that President Trump intends to stick taxpayers with the cost of a border wall that will hurt California ’s economy , environment and people , " Lara said in a statement according California’s Tribune . " I introduced Senate Bill 30 to give our state a louder voice to say that building a wasteful and unnecessary wall would be a huge mistake . " " Another wall will delay cargo delivery , slow down business and take away valuable jobs , " he wrote . Lara is not the only California Democrat obsessed with Trump ’s wall , Lara it seems Lara have clouded his judgement .   This has nothing to do with saving money —   Lara is Lara one who just proposed a      universal health plan to include illegal aliens Lara   which will cost taxpayers billions of dollars .   Anyone familiar with the border knows that there are 25’ high walls topped with razor wire near San Diego ’s largest port of entry for vehicles and cargo —   and the only ‘ cargo’ delayed would be cargo or persons entering the country illegally . Building the border wall wo n’t ‘ take away valuable jobs’ as Lara alleges —   it will create    new jobs and protect Californians already employed by making illegal entry more Lara alleges —   . Since Trump ’s election ,    hysteria has become the norm in California .   Two San Francisco Supervisors are pushing an even tougher measure that would ban any company that bids on the border wall from consideration for city contracts . According to the San Francisco Chronicle , " any company looking at President Trump ’s proposed border wall between Mexico and the United States as a business opportunity may soon want to reconsider —   if it wants to do business with San Francisco . "   Two supervisors introduced a local measure last month that would " bar San Francisco from contracting with companies that seek a deal to work on the wall during San Francisco period , regardless of whether the companies win a contract . " " It is time to move beyond symbolism and use the power we have as a city to fight for the values we hold most dear , " Supervisor Hillary Ronen told the Chronicle in March , who is we the measure with Supervisor Aaron Peskin . Not surprisingly , other Bay Area cities are following suit .   The Berkeley City Council unanimously passed a resolution as well advising the city to divest from any company involved in any aspect of the project .   Oakland is moving forward with a similar resolution . Since most government contractors seek to foster strong relationships with elected officials , it ’s no surprise that those with the most to lose —   huge mega corporations and global conglomerates —   are being silent . Among them are two companies that have massive   contracts with the city , according to the SF those with the most to lose —  huge mega corporations and global conglomerates —  are being silent : " Hensel Phelps Construction Co. in Oakland , the city signed a $ 1 . 1 billion contract to help build a new terminal Oakland San Francisco International Airport and Tutor Perini Corp. of Sylmar ( Los Angeles County ) . The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency has an $ 860 million contract with Tutor Perini to help construct the Central Subway , " —   and Tutor Perini won the contract to build Jerry Brown ’s High Speed Rail project . Los Angeles Times Tutor Perini    an $860 million contract with Tutor Perini to help construct the Central Subway building materials —   was considering a bid on the project , but spokesman Jorge Perez has since corrected the record .   Not only will the company " not participate " in building the wall it will Jerry Brown’s High Speed Rail project supply materials to contractors working on the project . Not everyone in San Francisco is supportive   Cemex ban .   One small contractor —   who   Cemex unlikely to meet the $ 25 million lead Jerry Brown’s High Speed Rail project requirement set out by Customs Border Protection to weed out smaller companies —   spoke out against the ban in the Chronicle : " My first reaction is why are taxpayer dollars being spent to hold committee meetings to boycott local companies that employ local workers ? That ’s a little on the radical side and basically , our taxpayer dollars are being used against us , " said James Flanagan , a San Francisco contractor . California has long prided itself on being one of the ‘ most tolerant’ states in the nation —   and our passed hundreds of laws to prohibit discrimination in order to prove it . It would California interesting to see what would happen if two words were added to the list of protected classes and then applied to every other    statute in the state —   " Political Orientation "   —   and then further require every one of these " " laws to apply to the California State government as well . Now there ’s an idea for a Republican member of the State Assembly or Senate —   that is , if there are any left with the courage to expose the Democrat hypocrisy by introducing a new bill or an amendment requiring the state to " stop discriminating " against Californians on the basis of their " political beliefs or orientation .
