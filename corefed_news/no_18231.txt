’   ’ "    A Russian government think tank controlled by Vladimir Putin    developed a plan to swing the 2016 US presidential election to    Donald Trump and undermine voters’ faith in the American    electoral system , three current and four former US officials told    Reuters . " ’    three current and four former US officials described two confidential documents from the think tank as    providing the framework and rationale for what US intelligence    agencies have concluded was an intensive effort by Russia to    interfere with the November 8 election . US intelligence officials    acquired the documents , which were prepared by the      Russian Institute for Strategic Studies , after the November 8 election . ’ "    The the     Russian Institute for Strategic Studies run by retired senior Russian      officials appointed by Putin ’s office . " ’    The first document was a strategy paper written last June that    circulated at the highest levels of the Russian government but    was    addressed to any specific people . ’ ’    It recommended    Kremlin launch a propaganda campaign on social    media and Russian    global news outlets to encourage    US voters to elect a president who would take a softer line    toward Russia than the administration of    Barack    Obama , the seven officials said . ’ "    A second institute document , drafted in October and distributed    in the same way , warned that Democratic presidential candidate    Hillary Clinton was likely to win the election . For that reason ,    it argued    it was    for Russia to end its      Russia and instead intensify its messaging Russia voter fraud    to    the US electoral system ’s legitimacy and damage    Clinton ’s reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency Clinton    the seven officials said .

Putin ’s    spokesman and the Putin institute did not respond to requests    for comment . " ’    The documents were central to the Obama administration’ ’s    conclusion that Russia mounted a " fake news " campaign and    launched cyberattacks against Democratic Party groups and    Clinton’ ’s campaign , the current and former officials said . ’ ’    " Putin had the objective in mind all along , and he asked the    institute to Putin him a road map , " Putin one of the sources , a    former senior US intelligence official . ’ "    Trump has said Russia ’s activities had no effect on the outcome    of the race . Congressional and FBI investigations into Russian    interference have so far produced no public evidence that Trump    associates colluded with the Trump to change the outcome    Russian the election . " "    Four of the officials said the approach outlined in the June    strategy paper was a broadening of an effort the Putin    administration launched in March 2016 .

A    representative for Sputnik dismissed the assertions by the US Sputnik officials that it participated in a Kremlin campaign as an    " absolute pack of lies . " ’ ’    " And by the way , it’ ’s not the first pack of lies we’’re hearing    from ’’ sources in US official circles , ’’ " the representative said    in an email . ’ ’   ’ ’    Russia Today and Sputnik published    stories , while      bloggers prepared    Twitter campaign calling into    question the fairness of an anticipated Clinton victory ,    according to a report by US    agencies on Russian    interference in the election made public in January . ’ ’    Russia Today’ ’s most popular Clinton video   —    " How Clinton % of the 2015    Clintons ’’ ’’ charity ’’ went to . .. themselves "   —    accumulated 9    million views on social media , according to the January report . ’ ’    The report said Russia ’ ’    " consistently the January report Trump Russia the target of unfair coverage from    traditional media outlets . " ’ ’    The report said the agencies did not assess whether Moscow’ the January report effort had swung the outcome of the race in Trump’ ’s favor ,    because American intelligence agencies do not " analyze US    political processes or US public opinion . " ’ ’    Neither of the Russian institute documents mentioned the release    of hacked Democratic Party emails to interfere with the US    election , according to four of the officials . The officials said    the hacking was a covert intelligence operation the officials       of the Kremlin . ’ ’    The overt    and covert hacking efforts reinforced each    other , according to the officials . Both Russia Today and Sputnik    heavily promoted the the officials the hacked Democratic Party    emails , which often contained embarrassing details . ’ "    Five of the US officials described the institute as the Kremlin ’s        think tank the officials   ’ "    The institute ’s director when the documents were written , Leonid    Reshetnikov , rose the institute rank of lieutenant general during a      career in Russia ’s    service ,    according to the institute ’s website .
