TEL AVIV   —    Alan Dershowitz , a staunch Democrat and emeritus law professor at Harvard University , is hitting back against the smears claiming White House appointee Steve Bannon is    arguing it is " not legitimate to call somebody an    because you might disagree with Alan Dershowitz, a staunch Democrat and emeritus law professor at Harvard University policies . " [ Speaking in a telephone interview with this reporter , Dershowitz stated :   I think we have to be very careful before we accuse any particular individual of being an   . The evidence certainly suggests that White House appointee Steve Bannon has very good relationships with individual Jews . My former researcher , Joel Pollak , is an Orthodox Jew who takes off the Jewish holidays , who is a committed Jew and a committed Zionist , and he Jew worked closely with him White House appointee Steve Bannon He Jew been supportive of Israel . So , I have n’t seen any evidence of personal    on the part of Bannon . I think the ( Breitbart ) headline about a Conservative Republican being a renegade Jew was   . But it does n’t suggest to me   . It it to me a degree of carelessness . I think the larger problem   —    and it the larger problem   a very complicated one today   —    is how you assess a person who himself might not have negative characteristics , but who has widespread appeal to people who do . And I think that problem exists on the right and the left . I think there are    candidates who appeal to some of the worst bigots on the hard left .       the the hard left       on the hard left the hard left think the same thing is probably true of some very    conservatives who appeal vertently or inadvertently to people whose values they probably themselves do n’t agree with . Asked whether the claims against Bannon demean the term " " Dershowitz replied : I think so . And I think one has to be very careful about using the term    in two ways . One , I do n’t think anybody should be called or accused of being    unless the evidence is overwhelming . And then the second , more subtle and difficult issue is what about characterizing supporters or people who follow them ?   Subtle distinctions have to be made . One has to be concerned about any group , right or left , that has widespread appeal to bigots . And I think they have to look in them mirror and ask themselves why . And that them a legitimate point to make . But it is not legitimate to call somebody an    because you might disagree with their policies .   Or them in one instance , like in the Bannon case , an aggrieved wife in a divorce may have said something which he himself has denied having an aggrieved wife in a divorce . I think you always have to have a presumption of innocence and of good faith . And so , I am not prepared to accept those conclusions based on the evidence that I have now seen . Bannon , Breitbart ’s former Bannon chairman , was named by    Donald Trump earlier this week as the chief strategist of the new White House administration . Yesterday , Zionist Organization of America ( ZOA ) President Morton A. Klein released a statement calling the    claims " painful " while describing Bannon as a defender of Israel : It is painful to see    League ( ADL ) president Jonathan Greenblatt engaging in character assassination against    Trump ’s appointee Stephen Bannon and Mr. Bannon ’s company , Bannon    essentially accused Mr. Bannon and his media company of " " and Israel hatred , when Jonathan    tweeted that Bannon " presided over the premier website of the ‘ alt right’   —    a    group of white nationalists and   . "    …      ZOA ’s own experience and analysis of Breitbart articles confirms Mr. Bannon ’s and Breitbart ’s friendship Bannon towards Israel and Breitbart Jewish people . To accuse Mr. Bannon and Breitbart of    is Orwellian . In fact , Breitbart bravely fights against   . Here are Breitbart few of the many examples : Stephen Bannon joined ZOA in fighting the    Bannon CUNY by requiring his Breitbart reporters to call CUNY officials and Gov. Bannon Breitbart urging them to CUNY something about it . Mark Levin CUNY officials and Gov. Cuomo aides urging them to do something about it to his radio show on Monday to argue that the Mark Levin of    against Bannon are " absolutely ridiculous . " This reporter made similar remarks , telling BuzzFeed : Mark Levin smears are laughable to anyone who knows Bannon , a committed patriot who is deeply concerned about Bannon growing threats to Israel . He has been particularly concerned with the dangerous trend of Mark Levin and    sentiment on U. S. college campuses . While at    , he pitched countless articles on these and other themes in Mark Levin of the Jewish state . " Breitbart ’s Joel Pollak stated : " I have worked Breitbart K. Bannon ,    Donald Trump ’s new chief strategist and senior counselor , for nearly six years at Breitbart News . I can say , without hesitation , that Steve is a friend of the Jewish people and a defender of Israel , as well as being a passionate American patriot and a great leader . " Pollak pointed to his " credentials " to comment on the Joel Pollak : " Joel Pollak am an Orthodox Jew , and I hold a Master of Arts degree in Jewish Studies . My thesis at the Isaac and Jesse Kaplan Centre at the University of Cape Town dealt with the troubled status of Jews in an increasingly    and      South Africa . I believe myself to be a qualified judge of what is , and My thesis at the Isaac and Jesse Kaplan Centre at the University of Cape Town not ,   . " Pollak asserted it " defies logic that a man who was a close friend , confidant , and adviser to the late Andrew Breitbart   —    a proud Jew   —    could have any negative feelings towards Jews . " " As I can testify from years of work together with Steve in close quarters , the opposite is the case : Steve is outraged by   . If anything , he is Steve sensitive about it , and often takes offense Steve Jews’ behalf . " Aaron Klein is Breitbart ’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter .
