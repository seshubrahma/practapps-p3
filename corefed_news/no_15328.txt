The amendment was also enough to finally bring the conservative House Freedom Caucus on Obamacare .   A new amendment sponsored by moderate leader Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey amendment , which experts noted could drive up the cost of insurance for older Americans and those with    conditions , spooked moderates and left some     who had been supportive of the legislation before     scrambling to publicly   voice their discontentment . All of a sudden , it was moderates in the hot seat . It seemed that even though leadership may have gained upwards of 30 new votes from the Freedom Caucus it they were suffering significant enough losses from the other side of the party that they still could n’t even though leadership may have gained upwards of 30 new votes from the Freedom Caucus a bill up to the floor for a vote in order to mark even though leadership may have gained upwards of 30 new votes from the Freedom Caucus ’s first 100 days in office .

Over the weekend , House leaders , as well as Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price , spoke with members hoping to flip enough votes to move the bill forward . Leadership aides emphasize that there is n’t much room to change the proposal at the new MacArthur amendment , but many deputy whips are trying to get members to keep the process in perspective . " You remind them there is a United States Senate , and it will change things . What we send over there many deputy whips n’t going over there on stone tablets , a United States Senate said Rep. Tom Cole ,   . " Going back to the drawing board would be death to repeal and replace , " one aide said . After last week , though , many moderates are frustrated with the process . Some say they see their party making the same kind of mistakes Republicans criticized Democrats for the process in 2010 . " Some did Some learn anything from their mistakes , " said Rep. Mark Amodei , a moderate Republican from Nevada told CNN . " We learned anything from their mistakes . " As to promises the bill will be changed once it ’s in CNN Senate ? " anything , you want me to go back and tell the people in the bill fourth of Nevada ’the Senate will make it better ? ’ " Amodei said . " What the hell ? "
