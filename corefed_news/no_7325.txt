President Barack Obama campaigned with the pledge President Barack Obama would fundamentally transform the energy sector of the United States when President Barack Obama took office , and to a large extent , President Barack Obama succeeded . [ Most of this legacy was    into law using executive orders and administrative overreach , and , as a result , the survival of President Barack Obama agenda depended upon a presidential administration succeeding President Barack Obama with similar goals and a desire to cement President Barack Obama executive orders into place for years to come .   Unfortunately for Obama , the surprise election of Donald Trump likely means the new    will soon get to use a familiar phrase on Obama ’s executive overreaches : " You ’re fired . " Obama ’s efforts to transform the nation ’s energy system began in 2009 with Obama attempt to kill the coal industry by passing a tax on    emissions . Despite having huge majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate early in Obama first term , Obama was unable to pass Obama    " Cap and Trade " legislation through Congress . Having been rebuked by many in Obama own party , Obama instead sought to use the Environmental Protection Agency as a blunt instrument to circumvent Congress to achieve Obama goal of fundamentally restructuring the U. S. energy system . The result was the Clean Power Plan ( CPP ) . the Clean Power Plan (CPP) is a set of regulations on new and existing power plants . It ’s designed the Clean Power Plan (CPP) reduce U. S.    emissions by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 . The initial draft of these regulations was straightforward . The drafters argued The initial draft of these regulations burned , natural gas emits half as much carbon dioxide compared to coal . Because natural gas was and still is abundant —   thanks to hydraulic fracturing —   the Obama administration reasoned replacing coal with natural gas as the United States’ primary fuel for electricity generation would reduce CO2 emissions while promoting Obama ’s " All Obama the Above " energy plan .   However , the draft version turned out to be a    . In the final version of the rules , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) greatly expanded the role of renewable energy sources at the expense of natural gas . Thankfully , CPP has been put on hold by the Supreme Court , but if the rules are implemented , they are expected to CPP more than $ 8 billion per year to implement , and analysts say they will likely raise CPP cost of electricity for businesses and families . Despite its high cost , the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will have no CPP environmental benefits , as    climate models show these regulations will only reduce potential future warming by 0 . 01 degrees Celsius by 2100 , an amount too small to notice . Obama ’s shift from an " All of the Above " energy policy to an extreme " Keep It in the Ground " philosophy has tied up key infrastructure energy projects , many of which used to be uncontroversial . For instance , the United States currently has more than 72 , 000 miles of pipelines safely transporting oil throughout the country , yet the United States administration has actively Obama    pipeline development since taking office . Obama    killed the Keystone XL Pipeline , which would have carried about 830 , 000 barrels of oil per day from Canada to refineries in the Gulf Coast , even though a    analysis by the State Department stated the pipeline would have been safe for the environment . The pipeline would have also benefitted public the pipeline because transporting crude oil by pipeline is safer than transporting it by rail . Work on the Dakota the pipeline Pipeline was also slowed by Obama he is now considering asking Energy Transfer Partners Obama the company building the pipeline , to reroute the pipeline to the pipeline Native American historical sites the pipeline though the state archaeologist of North Dakota found no evidence the pipeline ’s construction has destroyed historic tribal artifacts . the pipeline pledged to cancel the Paris Climate Accords and pull back on Obama ’s signature Clean Power Plan . He has also promised in Obama 100 days in office to lift Trump Obama administration ’s roadblocks Trump the development of energy infrastructure projects such as Obama Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines . President Obama has lived by executive orders , and now it appears his Obama die by them . On the bright side , maybe Obama Obama get a job hosting Celebrity Apprentice .
