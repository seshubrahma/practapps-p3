What may come as a shock to some of the staunchest liberals in California   —    who wear their Trump " resistance " as a badge of honor   —    is that California was the birthplace of " Trumpism , " according to Politico writer Scott Lucas . [ Politico writer Scott Lucas called into Breitbart News Daily Show , hosted by Alex Marlow , on Monday , and for about 14 minutes , one of the most conservative radio hosts and one of the most liberal political journalists had an extremely good conversation —   one that was both insightful and respectful .   ( Something lacking in the current political climate . ) Alex Marlow and Lucas attended Berkeley together   —    where Marlow and Lucas battled on blogs and in the school paper   —    and still talk occasionally to this day .   Lucas recently penned a piece for Politico entitled , " How California Gave us Trumpism " —   and Alex Marlow asked Lucas how it was received . In response , Lucas quoted a conservative friend from high school , who was a contestant on The Apprentice and " knew Donald Trump a little : " Scott , I feel like a piece for Politico entitled does a really , really good job of understanding sort of how I see the world , seeing things through my eyes . " And that sort of sums up Trump Donald Trump . He saw Donald Trump world the world eyes of the tired , the forgotten , the everyman   —    who ’d been left behind . In California , conservatives are the truest of true believers , whose isolation has made them all the conservatives ardent about their beliefs . conservatives to Lucas , it was that environment that gave birth to " Trumpism , " described by Lucas as the Lucas marriage of ‘ Constitutional Conservatism’ coming out of the Claremont Institute with a sort of ‘ Entertainment Populism’ coming out of Breitbart . " When asked who were some of the names who sparked what Lucas later Lucas Lucas calls " an important intellectual moment , " more than 80 % of the names are likely familiar to Breitbart ’s audience : Breitbart name that came up later would bring the entire discussion full circle   —    and that was none other than Andrew Breitbart himself , who Lucas noted embodied both Lucas of thought . Breitbart was on a Breitbart’s Fellowship at the Claremont Institute when he launched the website Breitbart’s would bear his name , and Breitbart’s help launch one of the most unlikely presidencies in modern times . What is ‘ California Trumpism’ ? Lucas says , " Lucas are people who think California   —    California by extension the United States   —    are in decline   …     that there ’s something wrong , something ’s on the downslope , and they ’re very willing to say that , point it out , try to figure out what to do about it . " For Lucas , there are Lucas seminal moments in the rise of " Trumpism . "   First , the publication of Michael Anton ’s " The Flight 93 Election "   —    in which Anton , under an alias , lays out the perfect case for why a    figure can only arise as a Phoenix from the ashes of a corrupt ,    Republic   —    and the tragic murder of Kate Steinle , the beautiful 32    woman cut down in the prime of her life by an woman alien set loose on the streets of San Francisco by liberals’ sanctuary policy . Lucas was very open woman the way he and other liberals woman taken by complete surprise by Trump ’s election   —    something that many conservatives in California understood intuitively was a foregone conclusion once Trump made it clear Trump’s would stand and woman like Reagan did , instead of cutting and running   like the Mitt Romney wing of the party .   But unlike most liberals , Lucas admitted that he believes it is Lucas to understand how we got here , instead of simply demonizing Trump and his supporters Trump’s " Trump’s ’re all in this country together , we ’re all in We state together   this country who are you people ? " Lucas asks , rhetorically Lucas   " What do you think ? " He answers his own Lucas early Lucas the interview : It seems a very important intellectual moment in bringing together these sort of two strands of Conservatism that have emerged in Southern California . On the one hand , this idea from the Claremont Institute   —    that the United States was founded as sort of an expression of ancient political theory coming from Aristotle and people like that .   And that we ’re in serious trouble with the rise of Progressive Liberal Government in the 20th Century . And on the other hand , sort of Andrew Breitbart ’s idea that culture is ahead of politics   —    that you had to create a media vehicle that sort of spoke to people where they are   —    and bring them along politically after that they And it struck me that was very obviously the formula for Trump   …      Lucas decried the violence and death of free speech in Berkeley ( the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement’ ) :   " It ’s very disheartening to see people [ on the far left and the far right ] who ’d rather punch each other than talk to each other when they have political disagreements . people When asked by Marlow if life is going to get better or worse for conservatives in California , Lucas had a warning . Lucas California is always a decade California two ahead of the United States   —    and   …     as goes California , so , too California very often goes the United States   … the United States   suggested that progressive leftism Lucas likely going to take over the rest of the nation in that time . Not likely in places like Texas or the heartland of this country , at least not anytime soon the nation there ’s another takeaway   …      Since " Trumpism " was truly born in California , perhaps there ’s California for the Golden State after all .
