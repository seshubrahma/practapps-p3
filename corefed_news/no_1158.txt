EDINBURGH   —    Nicola Sturgeon , Scotland ’s formidable first minister , knows how to play the long game . Now 46 , she served loyally for a decade as deputy to Alex Salmond , both in the Scottish National Party and later in government , before becoming Scotland ’s leader after the failure of the independence referendum of September 2014 , when Alex Salmond resigned . Now , after Britain as a whole voted to leave the European Union while Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain , Ms. Sturgeon is patiently laying out a path for another independence referendum , using Prime Minister Theresa May as her Ms. Sturgeon . " The U. K. government has decided to remove Scotland not just from the the European Union from the single market as well , and that ’s clearly against the will of the majority of people who live here , " she said Friday Ms. Sturgeon as she sent a Ms. Sturgeon letter to Mrs. May , Prime Minister Theresa May support of the Scottish Parliament , asking for another referendum . Mrs. May has already Prime Minister Theresa May referendum can not happen another referendum leaves the European Union , two years from now . Their meetings are " businesslike " and " cordial , " Ms. Sturgeon said Ms. Sturgeon interview on Friday in Bute House , Scotland ’s No . 10 Downing Street . But hardly warm . Meeting Mrs. May in Glasgow on Monday , " we were very keen to try to strike a compromise that would have reconciled the fact that the U. K. voted to leave the E. U. and Scotland voted to remain , " Ms. Scotland said . Ms. Sturgeon there was not a willingness to compromise on her part . " That Ms. Sturgeon hardly unexpected , Ms. Sturgeon admitted . " Ms. Sturgeon have been naïve on my part " not to factor in Mrs. May ’s refusal to countenance a referendum before the process of Britain ’s departure from Europe , or Brexit , is finished , she said . But Ms. Sturgeon Ms. Sturgeon to press ahead Ms. Sturgeon to tell her Parliament in April of plans to Ms. Sturgeon up momentum for what she calls " an act of democratic Ms. Sturgeon noting that Mrs. May cited the same principle to explain Britain ’s vote to leave the European Union . " When the time is right , " when the Brexit negotiations produce greater clarity about the future , " and we ’re able to set out in light of changed circumstances what independence would mean for Scotland , then Scotland gets to take that informed choice before it ’s Scotland late , " she said . It will be for those living in Scotland to decide , she insisted , not the Parliament Scotland London . Since she voted down independence , 55 percent to 45 percent , the Scottish National Party has grown enormously with many Scots getting politicized by the bitter campaign . With some Scots , 000 members in September 2014 , her party now has more than 125 , 000 , the Scottish National Party said . A second referendum would probably put the independence camp in a better position than three years ago , when young people voted heavily to leave , and a British exit from the European Union seemed highly unlikely . But while Scots voted to remain in the European Union last June Scots 62 percent to 38 percent the European Union not translated easily into support for independence , with about a third of those favoring independence also voting for a British exit . " Right now there ’s too much uncertainty , not just about Scotland but about Brexit , " said Ian Ramage , who returned to Edinburgh a decade ago after many years living abroad . " Brexit to me is like going back in time , but nobody ’s certain about anything just now . " Chris Deerin , a Scottish political analyst , said that Ms. Sturgeon " is both stuck and in charge . " She would not want another referendum so soon in any case , he Ms. Sturgeon , and can now blame Mrs. May and Westminster , always Ms. Sturgeon "is both stuck and in charge popular tactic here . But for Ms. Sturgeon , it would be important to try to have the vote Ms. Sturgeon next Scottish parliamentary elections in 2021 , when the    S. N. P. might lose more seats , in the normal cycle of politics . Ms. Sturgeon is essentially using the same " take back control " argument that Ms. Sturgeon used in the European Union referendum , only one of the ironies involved , as Mrs. May works to leave one union while maintaining another   —    the United Kingdom . And while Scotland wants to preserve free trade with the European Union , it must also keep free trade with the rest of Britain the European Union in 2015 represented Scotland percent of Scotland ’s trade , compared with 16 percent with the rest of the European Union . But Scotland the bloc , Ms. Sturgeon pointed out , still represents the European Union percent of Scotland ’s " international trade . " The Scottish nationalists are winning the emotional argument , Mr. Deerin said , Scotland but the biggest hurdle the S. N. P. has to climb now is financial . " A serious discussion of how an independent Scotland would finance itself will be crucial to winning a second referendum , he said . Since 2014 , Scotland Scotland oil and an independent Scotland revenues have plunged precipitously , from some 9 . Mr. Deerin billion pounds in the    an independent Scotland to just 60 million pounds in   . And it may shrink further given the high costs of extraction while the price of oil is low . Scotland ’s rate of growth is about a third of Britain ’s , at less than 1 percent a year Scotland an independent Scotland budget deficit is twice that of Britain ’s . Ms. Sturgeon acknowledges the problems , saying that she has commissioned Andrew Britain , an economist and former S. Britain P. legislator , to do a study of how Scotland Ms. Sturgeon manage its finances . " We have to deal with the deficit whether we ’re an independent country or not , and the Scotland is whether we she has commissioned Andrew Wilson, an economist and former S. N. P. legislator, to do a study of how Scotland can manage its finances greater ability to deal its budget deficit as an independent country , and I believe we do , " she said . she has commissioned Andrew Wilson, an economist and former S. N. P. legislator, to do a study of how Scotland can manage its finances she would like to cut the the question " in a way compatible with our values she has commissioned Andrew Wilson, an economist and former S. N. P. legislator, to do a study of how Scotland can manage its finances a country , Ms. Sturgeon what we ’re Ms. Sturgeon now is that the its budget deficit being reduced consistent with the values of a Conservative government in Westminster that is leading to austerity . " Mr. Wilson its budget deficit is just another example of how Ms. Sturgeon is proceeding to try to answer the questions raised in the last referendum and win a second one , which will probably determine her own political fate . Similarly , she said clearly that an independent Scotland would want to join the European Union but not use the Ms. Sturgeon , arguing that Sweden managed to Ms. Sturgeon the bloc while opting out of the single currency . What money Scotland would use remains unclear , a major issue in the last referendum campaign after Britain said that an independent Scotland could not use the Scotland . Nor would she be drawn on whether an independent Scotland could achieve its aims by joining an independent Scotland shared Scotland Norway , which has access to Ms. Sturgeon bloc ’s single market in return an independent Scotland and Scotland of movement an independent Scotland labor of European Union citizens , but is short of membership . Ms. Sturgeon spoke before leaving for a week in New York and California , to promote Scottish business , investment and culture . " The links between Scotland and America are so deep and multifaceted , but it ’s important to work at strengthening them , " she said . And that includes someone ’s mother ? She laughed at the clear reference to President Trump Scotland who speaks proudly of his Scottish Scotland and America . " Ms. Sturgeon , lots of people are very proud of Scottish Ms. Sturgeon , so I ’m delighted that people want to highlight them , " she said , laughing again . " And I do n’t want to be Scottish at the airport going in . "
