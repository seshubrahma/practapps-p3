Sunday on Fox News channel ’s countdown to Iowa coverage , former Senator Bob Dole said while former Senator Bob Dole first choice for the Republican presidential nomination is Jeb Bush , if former Senator Bob Dole had to choose between Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and Donald Trump , former Senator Bob Dole said , " I would vote for Trump . I think former Senator Bob Dole ’s a negotiator . "   former Senator Bob Dole said , " Well , I still have a lot of friends in Iowa . They ’ve gotten a little older   but still have a lot of friends . I ’m a conservative . As I said , I ’m a Grassley , Ernst conservative . I do n’t   —    during my    years in the Senate I had a strong conservative record . But that ’s not good enough for Ted Cruz , who wants us to be on the far , far right . There are some people out there —   what ’s he going to do if he ’s elected ? he ’s going to cost us wholesale losses in the Congress and governors and state legislatures . " Dole continued , " I want to reiterate my candidate is the best qualified in the group , Jeb Bush . But if it came down to Trump and Cruz , I would vote for Trump . I think he ’s a negotiator . he knows many members of Congress . In fact , he contributed Democrats and Republicans . he ’s worked for Democrats and Republicans . More than I can say for Ted Cruz , the Lone Ranger in the senate . It ’s he way or the highway or shut down the government . Certainly does n’t do anyone any good and costs millions of dollars .
