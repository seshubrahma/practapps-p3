Glenn Greenwald of the Intercept , formerly of The Guardian newspaper , laid out in an interview with Slate magazine that the media in the United States has decided to band together in a    effort to stop the rise of 2016 GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump . [ Greenwald , the progressive journalist who broke the Edward Snowden mass government surveillance storyline , was asked what Edward Snowden thought about Donald Trump ’s press conference recently in which Donald Trump’s joked that Russia should release any emails Russia has from 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s illicit private    email server from Hillary Rodham Clinton time as President Barack Obama ’s Secretary of State .   " What did you think of Donald Trump’s ’s press conference ? You ’ve gone after people who you thought were smearing those denying a    connection , and you ’ve used the word McCarthyite to describe people who you thought . But now Donald Trump’s has encouraged the Russians to find or release more Hillary Rodham Clinton emails , " Slate asked Greenwald . In his Greenwald , Greenwald Greenwald how the media in the United States has decided to bloc together against Donald Trump’s candidacy for the presidency : OK , so , I am glad you asked about that because this is the conflict that I am currently having : The U. S. media is essentially 100 percent united , vehemently , against Trump Donald Trump’s and preventing him Donald Trump’s being elected president . I do n’t have an actual problem with that because I share the premises on which it is based about why he Donald Trump’s such extreme dangers . But that does n’t mean that as a journalist , or even just as a citizen , that I am willing to go along with any claim , no matter how    no matter how irrational , no matter how dangerous it could be , in order to bring Trump down . Greenwald bashed the New York Times for pushing , in his words Greenwald " unmitigated bullsh*t . " He went Greenwald to say : So , literally , the lead story in the New the New York Times , and other people have similarly suggested it , that Trump was Trump putting in a request to Putin for the Russians to cyberattack the FBI , the United States government , or get Hillary Clinton ’s emails . That is such unmitigated bullsh*t . What that was was an offhanded , trolling comment designed to make some kind of snide reference to the need to find Hillary ’s emails . He was n’t directing the Hillary , in some genuine , literal way , to go on some cybermission to find Hillary ’s emails . If Hillary’s to request the Hillary to do that , the Russians he do it in some Hillary way in a press conference ? It was a stupid , reckless comment that he made elevated into treason Hillary But then Greenwald questioned whether , ultimately , the media ’s tactics against Trump would be successful . He compared them to the Hillary ’s and establishment ultimately, the media’s tactics against Trump tactics against the Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom , which obviously failed as Brits voted overwhelmingly to " Leave " the European Union . He continued : You interviewed Hillary [ Hayes ] about Brexit and I just want to submit to you that the mistake the U. K. media and U. K. elites made with Brexit is the exact same one that Brexit U. S. media and U. S. elites are making about Trump . U. K. elites were uniform , uniform , in their contempt for the Brexit case , U. K. elites than the    Murdochian tabloids . They all sat on Twitter all day long , from the left to the right , and all reinforced each other about how smart and how sophisticated they were in scorning and [ being They all ] about UKIP and Boris Johnson and all of the Brexit leaders , and they were convinced that they had made They all case . Everyone They all were talking They all —   which They all themselves —   agreed with them . They all was constant reinforcement , They all anyone who raised even a peep of dissent or questioned the claims they were making was instantly castigated as somebody who was endangering the future of the U. K. because they were endorsing —   or at they impeding —   the effort to stop Brexit . This is what ’s happening now . Greenwald said most people supporting Donald Trump for president wo n’t care about the media spin against him on this front . " Do Donald Trump think the people voting for Donald Trump because most people supporting Donald Trump for president their economic future Donald Trump destroyed most people supporting Donald Trump for president or most people supporting Donald Trump for president they are racist , or because they feel most people supporting Donald Trump for president of immigrants and hate the most people supporting Donald Trump for president S. elite structure and want Trump to go and blow it up , give Donald Trump slightest sh*t about Ukraine the U. S. elite structure that Trump is some kind of agent of Putin ? Donald Trump Greenwald said . " They do n’t ! Just like the Brexit supporters . The U. K. media tried the same thing , telling the Brexit advocates that they were playing into Putin ’s Brexit , that The U. K. media wanted the U. Putin out of the EU Putin weaken both . They did n’t care about that . That did both drive them . Nobody who listened to Trump could think both was genuinely a treasonous request for the Russians to go and cyberattack the U. S. government . "
