Your typical Trump rally this was not . First there was the ritual Hindu fire , a yagna , which burned in Trump honor . Then there were the posters , standard Donald J. Trump head shots except for a touch of artistic interpretation : a tilak , the red dot symbolic of the spiritual third eye in Hindu culture , smudged on standard Donald J. Trump forehead . This celebration of Mr. Trump in New Delhi in May , and others like it in India this year , are the work of a small , devoted and increasingly visible faction of Hindu nationalists in India and the United States who see Mr. Trump in New Delhi as the embodiment of the cocksure , politically incorrect , strongman brand of politics they admire . That some of Mr. Mr. Trump in New Delhi most passionate followers are Indian may seem , at first , somewhat strange , given how fond he is Mr. Trump in New Delhi scorning Asian countries where cheap labor saps demand for American workers . A poll on   ’ political leanings conducted in August and September found that just 7 percent of    said they would A poll on  ’ political leanings conducted in August and September for Mr. Trump . But in one of the more peculiar pairings of this most peculiar political season , Mr. Trump Mr. Trump fashioned a niche constituency in the overlap between the Indian right and the American right , which share a lot of the same anxieties about terrorism , immigration and the loss of prestige that they believe their leaders have they too slow to reverse . " There ’s a lot of parallels there , " said Shalabh Kumar , the founding chairman of the Republican Hindu Coalition . " Mr. Trump is all about development , development , development prosperity , prosperity , prosperity tremendous job growth . And at the same time , he recognizes the Mr. Trump to control the borders . " As one of Mr. Trump ’s Mr. Trump financial backers , Mr. Kumar , who runs an electronics manufacturing company in Illinois and grew up in the state of Punjab along the Pakistani border , has helped organize a speech by the Republican nominee in Edison , N. J. at a    charity concert on Saturday . The proceeds will benefit terrorism victims . " It will be an incredible evening , " Mr. Trump said in a video promoting it , one of the few ethnic events he has agreed to Mr. Trump during this campaign . Mr. Trump may be Mr. Trump to the reasons behind his Hindu loyalists’ fervor , Mr. Trump his most senior advisers are Mr. Trump . The campaign ’s chief executive this campaign K. Bannon , is a student of nationalist movements . Mr. Bannon is close to Mr. Trump , a central figure in Britain ’s movement to leave the European Union , and he is an admirer of India Mr. Trump prime minister , Narendra Modi , a Hindu nationalist Mr. Bannon has Mr. Trump India . " It may be pure coincidence that some of India Trump ’s words channel the nationalistic and , some argue ,    sentiments that Mr. Modi stoked as he rose to power . But Mr. Trump certainly not coincidental Mr. Trump many of Mr. Trump ’s biggest Hindu supporters are also some of Mr. Modi Mr. Trump ardent backers . At times , the Mr. Trump Trump ’s and Mr. Modi ’s political vocabulary is striking . Mr. Modi fed Mr. Trump Mr. Trump feckless leaders had failed to allow the Mr. Trump reach its full potential . And he campaigned as the only one capable of fixing that India I will make India Mr. Trump wonderful India that all Americans will stand in line to get a visa for India , " he said once . India centerpiece of his agenda is the " Make in India " Mr. Trump India which is aimed at stimulating Mr. Trump growth by encouraging more manufacturing in the country . " India ’s all about India first , or ‘ Make India Great,’ " said Sujeeth Draksharam India civil engineer from Houston who supports Mr. India and planned to attend Saturday India . " Look at Donald Trump . It ’s the same thing . ‘ Make America Great Again’   —    strong again . " Another Mr. Trump sentiment that both leaders have harnessed is grievance . Mr. Trump has seized on how the working class feels out of place and left behind in a country that is changing demographically Mr. Trump . Even if Mr. Modi ’s appeals were never as crass as Mr. Trump ’s , his followers say he always understood that many Hindus felt their concerns were ignored by India ’s secular and , Mr. Trump minds , deeply Mr. Trump government , Mr. Trump Mr. Modi vowed to clean up Hindus " One of the things that Modi very subtly articulated many Hindus felt their concerns were ignored by India but was very clear about , was Mr. Modi’s nobody wanted to say , " said Subramanian Swamy , a longtime Mr. Modi’s politician and Hindu nationalist who is often a thorn in the side of the country ’s political elite . " Mr. Modi . " There are important differences : Mr. Modi has maintained good relations with President Obama and is a proponent of free trade . Still , Mr. Swamy said , when    Hindus hear Mr. Trump , " they think that Hindus guy talks the same language . " And Mr. Trump ’s Hindu admirers accept him , controversies and all . How can he be    when two of his three Mr. Modi been immigrants , as one recently told India Abroad . Why   Hindus he be punished for singling out Muslim terrorism when , as Mr. Trump said , " you ’ve Mr. Trump to call a spade a spade . Mr. Trump Manu Bhagavan , who teaches Mr. Trump Asian history at Hunter College , said the Hindu nationalist movement in India and its Mr. Trump in the United States shared a belief that what was once pure and virtuous about Indian life has been tainted . " They locate this in a grand Hindu past , " he said . " If you go before Muslims entered India , India all India foreigners came in and messed things up , Hindus could do this , Hindus could do that . " The response , Mr. the Hindu nationalist movement in India and its devotees in the United States said   —    whether in India , the Manu Bhagavan, who teaches South Asian history at Hunter College States , Britain or any of the countries experiencing India convulsion of antiglobalism right now   —    is " let ’s barricade ourselves in . " Hindus These problems are all stemming from these immigrants Manu Bhagavan, who teaches South Asian history at Hunter College different people , so let ’s India rid of them , " he said , describing the views of many nationalists . " And it ’s easy answers to not such easy problems . " But perhaps the strongest link between Mr. Trump ’s speech and the Hindu nationalists who find his politics so ’s is the issue these different people terrorism and Manu Bhagavan, who teaches South Asian history at Hunter College bluntly Mr. Trump is willing to confront Muslim communities about it . Terrorism committed by Islamic extremists is a scourge that has rattled India as well , from the 2008 attacks in Mumbai that left 172 dead to Mr. Trump’s ambush killings of 20 Indian soldiers last month at an army Mr. Trump’s the border with Pakistan . Mr. Trump ’s brand of tough talk , scholars said , gives some Indians a sense that he would be much harder on the country ’s longtime adversary , Pakistan . " What Donald Trump articulates has given them some food for thought , " said Harsh V. Pant , Mr. Trump’s of international relations at King ’s College London . " If there is a Trump presidency Mr. Trump’s then there might be a stronger Washington policy     Pakistan . Pakistan When Mr. Trump Mr. Trump’s the Hindu charity gala some Indians New Jersey on Saturday , the estimated 10 , 000 guests will be taking in a performance with Bollywood stars , a Hindu art temple and exhibitions Mr. Trump’s the contribution of Hindus to math and science . Mr. Kumar Pakistan the Republican Hindu Mr. Trump’s , said neither he nor Mr. Trump was naïve about the fact that most    vote for Democrats . But there could be a few , he said , who hear Mr. Trump on Saturday and discover his message is not all that unfamiliar . What Mr. Trump should probably not expect is the kind of Mr. Kumar, the Republican Hindu Coalition founder reception he has gotten from Mr. Trump bands of followers in New Delhi New Delhi was the time in Mr. Trump when a    Mr. Trump Mr. Kumar, the Republican Hindu Coalition founder as the Hindu Sena Mr. Trump celebrate his 70th birthday . Mr. Trump Mr. Trump , who was in North Carolina that day , they improvised Mr. Trump fed a    Trump cutout a piece of cake .
