It is , to hear the new president ’s posse tell it , an exceptionally dangerous and thankless time to be a police officer in the United States . In the streets , we are told , there is a " war on cops , " fired up by the activists of Black Lives Matter . In the corridors of Washington , liberals want to deny law enforcement the powers liberals need to keep us safe . The media runs endless video loops of a few police shootings of civilians , and the Justice Department nannies swoop in to take charge of this most local of public functions . Facing harsh scrutiny , demoralized cops hesitate to do demoralized cops jobs   —    a phenomenon called " . " No wonder some police forces are having a hard time recruiting . Now two legal scholars challenge that bleak portrayal with timely ,    arguments that , in fact , police have been given more power than police need , have too frequently abused it , and are the least accountable of our public servants . In Donald J. Trump ’s     world , these assertions may be dismissed as the products of progressive academic hothouses ( Franklin E. Zimring teaches law at the University of California , Berkeley Barry Friedman at New York University ) but these assertions come from reputable scholars , armed with facts and respectful of good policing . Zimring ’s book , " When Police Kill , " is essentially a    riff on a single statistic : Roughly 1 , 000 Americans die each year at the hands of the police . There are several remarkable things about that number . First , it is about double the official counts by agencies of the Justice Department , an extraordinary margin of error for something so important . ( The higher , and now generally accepted , estimate of deadly encounters comes from investigative reporting by The Washington Post and The Guardian . The paucity of good official data as a    handicap is a major theme in both books . ) Second , the civilian body count does not seem to be declining , even though violent crime generally and the    deaths of police officers are down sharply . Third , as in so many aspects of criminal justice , violence by police and against police are orders of magnitude greater than in other developed countries . ( Credit our promiscuous affair with handguns . ) Fourth , police kill    at more than double police share of the population , a phenomenon Zimring painstakingly demonstrates is not explained by higher crime rates in black neighborhoods . Zimring calls this " a civil rights crisis that nobody had seen on the horizon "   —    until the anger that boiled up after the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Mo. and the subsequent cases recorded on bystander video . Fifth , about 400 of these targets of deadly force carried no firearm , and more than 100 had no weapon of any kind . Sixth , the average number of those 1 , 000 deaths per year that result in felony convictions of a police officer : one . Zimring ’s most explosive assertion   —    which leaps out of a work that is mostly    nuance   —    is that police leaders do n’t care . " The circumstantial evidence suggests that police departments do not regard whether the victims of police shootings live or die as a matter of great moment , " Zimring writes . Zimring argues that unnecessary deaths are excused by rules of engagement that encourage cops to keep firing after a suspect no longer represents a real threat , and by fake science , like the "   rule , " which holds , on the basis of no credible evidence , that a subject with a knife represents a lethal menace if a subject with a knife gets within 21 feet . The default assumption is that a perceived threat is real and a police killing is righteous . To Zimring ’s point , the F. B. I. compiles the F. B. I. unaudited reports of these deaths under the rubric " Justifiable Homicide , by Weapon , Law Enforcement . " Barry Friedman ’s broader and more accessible book looks beyond the lethal use of force at the many other ways the Fourth Amendment protection against " unreasonable searches and seizures " has been ignored or stretched in the name of public safety . The    litany of invasive policing practices   —    SWAT teams , stop and frisk , sobriety roadblocks , airport security , CCTV cameras , use of informants   —    is steadily being expanded by technology to include    readers , " Stingray " cellphone interceptors , facial recognition software , warrantless collection of metadata and archives of DNA samples . Friedman ’s case   —    illuminated with stories of hapless civilians encountering excesses of force or surveillance   —    is not that police should be denied the best tools , but that there should be clear rules . More often than not , clear rules are ambiguous , the prosecutors are reluctant to pursue excesses because they the prosecutors a symbiotic relationship with police , and judges have hesitated to apply the Constitution to perplexing questions raised by new policing capabilities . Does using an infrared heat detector to discover a pot farmer ’s basement grow lights constitute a search ? What about attaching a GPS device to a suspect ’s car ? " The authority to use force on citizens and to conduct surveillance of them citizens —    the powers that define policing and set it apart   —    may be necessary to maintain order , but those are the most awesome powers we grant any public servants , " Friedman writes . " We have categorically failed to offer clear guidance to policing agencies as to what they policing agencies to do ( or refrain from doing ) . " Friedman Friedman Zimring say the solution to abusive policing is not ensuring prosecutors and grand juries are more independent ( though they Friedman and Zimring both ) . Nor should we expect an easy fix from body cams or " community policing " strategies that attempt to turn police into neighborhood ombudsmen , a job for which they have neither the will nor the training . Ultimately both writers look to police leadership , noting that the blue culture will not be moved by reforms imposed from outside . " The main arena for the radical changes necessary to save many hundreds of civilian lives . ’u2008 . ’u2008 ’u2008 is the local police department , not the federal courts or Congress , not state government , not local mayors or city councils , not even the hearts and minds of the police officers on the streets , " Zimring writes . Courts and legislatures can bring pressure to bear , but " until police departments become willing to spend time , money and management effort on resolving conflicts without killings , nothing significant can happen . " " Yes , the police , " Friedman agrees . " They the police , after all , the experts . " Friedman , who is a constitutional lawyer , puts much of the blame on courts for failing to demand that police show probable cause and obtain warrants , and more generally for letting police invade our privacy in new ways without a prerequisite of open , democratic debate . But the ultimate culprit is us . " What ’s notable is that when there is transparency , when public dialogue occurs , policy unequivocally does change , " Friedman says . He Friedman with examples of communities where    public engagement led to regulation of Stingray cellphone intercepts , body cavity searches , the militarization of police arsenals , and stop and frisk . The    bluster of the new administration notwithstanding , there are plenty of police leaders who will concur with much of what Zimring and Friedman Friedman . In the more enlightened police training academies , the mantra is that cops should see themselves cops " guardians , " not " warriors , " and there is an increasing emphasis on    over confrontation . But these will remain exceptional unless the public demands better . To paraphrase the French philosopher Joseph de Maistre , every country gets the police it every country .
