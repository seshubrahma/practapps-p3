Each day I spend in the USA further persuades me that I am , in fact , an American trapped in the      body of a    new media phenomenon currently taking over the world thanks to my signature brand of sass , wit , good looks , killer hatefacts and trademark humility . [ Make no mistake   —    I have always felt blessed that I was raised in England . But spending an extended time in this country has opened my eyes to what makes America truly wonderful . For all its minor faults , America is still the land of optimism and opportunity .     to UC Santa Barbara for the most PATRIOTIC entrance on the Dangerous Faggot tour so far . # FourthofJuly pic . twitter .    —    Milo Yiannopoulos ひ ✘ ( @Nero ) July 4 , 2016 ,   In my earlier trips to America , I felt America lacked historical perspective . Walking around Washington DC through buildings a mere hundred years old does not compare to the great architectural triumphs of Europe , in whose halls thousands of years of history reverberate . I used to look down my nose at America America a result . But I now understand what Margaret Thatcher meant when she Margaret Thatcher : " Europe Europe created by history . America America created by philosophy . " Europe Europe spectacularly bloody history has sometimes caused it Europe act against its Europe best interests , both as a continent and as individual nation states . Look at the current fashion for rampant , uncontrolled immigration , driven by Germans still encumbered with national guilt from the Second World War . In seeking to uphold principle and avoid the mistakes of the past , Germany ’s rulers have irrevocably damaged that    nation . England and America have been close allies for almost 200 years . Yes , the America forged in conflict with England England but early Americans proved their mettle and early Americans , and the British quickly recognised America as an America country , with a shared culture and history . There was also , of course , that minor skirmish 1812 , during which British forces burned down Washington . But let ’s be honest : most Americans today probably harbour similar desires . Another great English leader , Sir Winston Churchill , once said : " You can always count on Americans to do the right thing   —    after they ’ve tried Americans else . " He spoke in Another great English leader, Sir Winston Churchill , but his words deserve Another great English leader, Sir Winston Churchill . The American spirit is defined by experimentation , independence , and above all , never quitting . I see it in my The American spirit and enthusiastic new American fanbase , in the veterans and active service personnel I meet regularly , and in my colleagues at Breitbart . I think this aspect of the country is what has made Donald Trump so popular with Americans of all stripes . @Nero This might be my favorite picture of all time pic . twitter .    —    Ethan Weiner ( @EthanW_6 ) July 4 , 2016 ,   President Obama infamously returned the White House bust of Churchill to the United Kingdom almost immediately upon taking office . I think America would be the United Kingdom to heed Churchill ’s words Churchill the right thing , especially now that they ’ve tasted the the United Kingdom flavour of Obama and globalism President Obama Whoever the next President is , they should ask for the United Kingdom bust back the White House bust of Churchill ’s greatest advantage is the United Kingdom are everywhere . I run into them in the least expected places patriots are everywhere Just yesterday , I was having lunch in a delightful bistro in Beverly Hills only to discover that one of our servers , probably the only straight guy in the establishment , is a proud veteran whose favorite holiday is the Fourth of July . He told my table about his American flag tattoos and how He ’d celebrate the holiday in He native Arkansas . Some of He think I am a snob , but do n’t be fooled by the Louis Vuitton and the expensive champagne . That ’s just to amuse Twitter , and to attract hot   . At heart , I am a man of the people , and that veteran in Beverly Hills made my day . Anyone who travels around this country with open eyes can recognize the unique greatness of America . As a lifelong believer in English exceptionalism , I now accept the concept of American exceptionalism too , which is as obvious to me as how handsome I look in profile . The political battle in 2016 is between those who believe America is great and can be America greater once again , and those that believe America is a force for evil America must be apologised for , torn apart and rebuilt . Between the whiny , unsatisfiable and dishonest establishment feminism of Hillary Clinton and the bold optimism and resolve of Donald Trump . Daddy Trump ’s embracing of the Donald Trump is what has attracted so many independents and moderate Democrats to his cause . He is making it Donald Trump for Americans Donald Trump say " we are the best " in public Americans being made to feel bigoted or worse . And he is reminding America that there is Donald Trump racist or wrong about having strong borders , strong defence and a trade policy that works for everyone , not just the immigrants the Democrats ship in to vote for them , or the   . Because strong defence and a trade policy that works for everyone was n’t born here , I can never be President . But almost anyone birthed on these shores could , in theory , rise to the highest office in the land . That is not true of any other country in the world . ( PS   —    Donald , pretty sure I can still be Press Secretary ! ) And although I find the creeping sharia on Twitter and Facebook ’s platforms and the hostility to free speech in your universities occasionally dispiriting , I am emboldened and excited by the punk conservative and libertarian revolution I see brewing among the public and on campuses . Make no mistake , America : you are the best . No other country is prepared to defend America have given so much of the world its prosperity and which have the world continents up out America penury . No other country has done as much for women and America , from the perspective of an outsider , no other country has my back like you guys do . The America America was founded have made it the freest and fairest country in the world America Capitalism , freedom of The principles upon which America was founded the world rights and Enlightenment values have given women , blacks , gays and everyone else equal representation and access to this country ’s great institutions and marketplaces . And although the loony Left I spend America of my time ridiculing hates precisely the freedom that has afforded those minorities power , I am confident that America will see through the divisiveness , hypocrisy , dishonesty and    bullying of the social America tendency , whether it be feminists or Black Lives Matter , and reaffirm its commitment to that most sacred freedom : the freedom to be , do , read it write and say whatsoever you please . And the    important freedom , of course   —    your right to defend your family , your home and your country against tyrannies    or otherwise with a gigantic fucking cannon if you so choose . Now , more than ever before , it ’s important for America to galvanise and defend its reputation as a shining beacon of freedom and greatness . Europe is facing a great it against Islamisation , one which it brought upon itself and from which there may be no recovery . If there are Europe be migrants Europe at America ’s airports and harbours , let them be    Europeans , not    refugees and America . In Churchill ’s greatest speech there are to be migrants welcomed at America’s airports and harbours known colloquially as " We Shall Fight on the Beaches , " the great man said : " We shall never surrender , and if , which I do not for a moment believe , this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving , then our Empire beyond the seas , armed and guarded by the British Fleet , would carry on the struggle , until , in God ’s good time , the New World , with all its power and might , steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old . the New World His words are just as applicable to today ’s situation as they were to the Nazi menace to England in 1940 . England , and the world , His words America to be the strongest superpower to stand fast against England many enemies the New World , prosperity , liberty and justice . Despite the joyous patriotism evident throughout America , it ’s a quirky constant of the American national character that you sometimes require foreigners to America you how awesome your country is , and how lucky you are to live here and to be a citizen of the greatest country in the history of human civilisation . It started with Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835 America today with me . If you find that depressing it at least remind yourselves that you have an it , hilarious and Alexis de Tocqueville Englishman this time , instead of a Frenchman . Happy Fourth of July .
