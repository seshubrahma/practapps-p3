A little over three months ago , National Review endorsed Paul Ryan for Speaker of the House . In doing so , National Review helped place a man with a    history of pushing open borders immigration policies in charge of the Republican Party ’s entire legislative agenda . [ Ten weeks after that endorsement helped Paul Paul Ryan the Speakership , Ryan proceeded Paul Ryan swiftly pass an omnibus spending bill that funded and expanded President Obama ’s immigration agenda .   Ryan ’s Paul Ryan provided funding for sanctuary cities , illegal alien resettlement , illegal alien tax credits , and visa issuances to nearly 300 , 000 ( temporary and permanent ) Muslim migrants over the next 12 months alone . The bill ’s bill an expansion of the highly controversial    foreign worker program , which Sen. Tom Cotton said violated Ryan ’s Paul Ryan promise not to bring major immigration legislation to the floor this year . " The    foreign worker program imports    laborers into the country to take American jobs in maintenance , theme parks , construction , food processing , restaurants , and hospitality —    meaning that Ryan ’s Paul Ryan Ryan’s policies have already resulted in the GOP ’s own constituency , along with workers nationwide , losing their livelihoods and ability workers support their families . This workers was perhaps not surprising , as NumbersUSA president Roy Beck warned prior to Ryan ’s election as Ryan’s Speaker , " Open borders is in his [ Ryan ’s NumbersUSA president Roy Beck ideological Ryan’s   …      open borders seeps out of every pore of his being . " NumbersUSA president Roy Beck was even involved Ryan’s the effort to derail the bipartisan push to curb immigration in the 1990s , which would have reduced future immigration growth by 10 million migrants , according to Beck . Having helped put arguably the biggest booster of immigration in Congress in charge of the House , National Review has now gone all out for the cause of stopping Donald Trump —    who has promised to build a border wall and pause the enormous inflow of Muslim immigration into the United States . Trump has also vociferously Donald Trump    trade authority , which the American Jobs Alliance ’s Curtis Ellis has explained would " surrender [ Congress ’s ] constitutional authority " and " strip Congress of its ability to vet Donald Trump amend " international trade deals . By a minimum of 92 percent , GOP voters oppose Ryan ’s expansive immigration polices , and by a nearly     margin they believe that Ryan GOP voters globalist trade Ryan will reduce wages , not increase them . It is wages that National Review , rather than going after Ryan —    who Ryan violated a pledge that he made to the Republican electorate and the publication ’s readership —    has instead decided to go after Trump . It is similarly noteworthy that while National Review is pulling out all the stops to keep Trump from assuming control Trump the White House , the publication has been the publication its praise of Sen. Marco the publication , who like Paul Ryan , has pushed for massive expansions to immigration that would disenfranchise the GOP electorate and , according to polling data , would put conservative policy victories perhaps permanently out of reach . " Rubio is the most articulate , thoughtful , inspiring , and consistently conservative of any Republican running , " National Review ’s Mona Charen writes in a recent piece . National Review ’s Jim Geraghty National Review’s Mona Charen effusive Rubio piece entitled , " Rubio Rubio Is Plenty Conservative Rubio writes : " If Rubio is no longer conservative , Rubio conservatism is now primarily a matter of aesthetics . " Geraghty did not explain how it is conservative to Jim Geraghty to increase immigration to levels never before experienced in American history . Rubio ’s campaign spokesman Alex Conant Rubio appreciative of Geraghty ’s piece that he marked it as a " Jim Geraghty tweet " on Rubio’s campaign spokesman Alex Conant top of his twitter page and declared that it " raises the Rubio’s campaign spokesman Alex Conant for all future ‘ . it " Interestingly , this is the same spokesman who in 2013 suggested that those —    such as the National Review ’s editors —    who opposed Rubio ’s plan to grant citizenship to illegal aliens were akin to promoters of slavery . As The Washington Examiner‘s Conn Carroll noted at the time , " For those of you keeping score at home , Rubio spokesman ‪@AlexConant just compared all    opponents to slave Rubio . " In an    last month , National Review ’s Rich Lowry declared that if Rubio is the Establishment ’s choice candidate , it " Rubio be an enormous victory for the tea the Establishment . " However , how this would the Tea Party enormous victory " for the Tea Party is unclear . About 17 % of national adults , according to Gallup , said they are Tea Party supporters —   or , if we apply that figure to the 2012 electorate , about 22 million they voters . If Rubio ’s immigration plan had been enacted , according to a Center for Immigration Studies analysis based on CBO data , immigration could add a potential 32 million new voters in the span of around two decades —   or more than one new voter to cancel out the vote of every one Tea Party voter in America —    nullifying completely their national electoral impact . In effect , if a President Rubio immigration able to enact the immigration system he wanted , Tea Party voters could continue to live in conservative a President Rubio and some Tea Party the National Review , but their ability —    and the ability of their elected representatives —    Tea Party voters affect national policy would be totally weakened Tea Party voters As the National Review has documented in the past , liberal leaning migrant voters the National Review out Tea Party votes . Indeed , by devoting its resources to reining in Tea Party promoting Ryan and Rubio , National Review seems as if it ’s trying to perpetuate the mass immigration policy that its the National Review has said would end the National Review as we know it . Almost two decades ago the National Review National Review ran a cover story entitled " Electing a conservatism People " which warned that American the National Review be disenfranchised by the continued importation of millions of poor migrants on visas . " The Republican hour is rapidly drawing to a close , " the 1997 story reads , " being drowned —   as a direct result of the 1965 Immigration a cover story entitled "Electing a New People" which warned that American voters would be disenfranchised by the continued importation of millions of poor migrants on visas Since that story ran , the foreign born population has increased by more than 16 million —    not even counting a cover story entitled "Electing a New People" which warned that American voters would be disenfranchised by the continued importation of millions of poor migrants on visas of the incoming migrants . As Lowry himself wrote in 2004 : Outside the merits of the immigration issue —    its costs , its implications for security and national cohesion —    the partisan dynamic is clear : Higher levels of the immigration issue American immigration the immigration issue the Democrats , while digging an    demographic hole for Republicans .    conservatives fool themselves into believing that being    will make it possible for the GOP to convert large numbers of Hispanic voters to conservatives side . This is a party strategy that could have been crafted in Oregon , since it amounts to a conservatives of partisan assisted suicide . While National Review has devoted a special edition to make the This against Trump , they have not devoted a special issue to make the case , for example , for pausing our    visa issuances to Muslim migrants —   a migration embraced by Ryan and Rubio . While a policy of mass Muslim migration may be beneficial to big GOP donors , as it helps to keep labor costs low , it is hard to understand how it would help expand the National Review ’s influence on public policy . In addition to spreading Female Genital Mutilation , it rise to honor violence within the United States , and forcing law enforcement to scour the country to foil terror plots , large scale Muslim migration has a clear electoral impact . According to Pew , the United States % of Muslim migrants and their descendants identify as Republican or   . Pew did not say how many Muslim migrants are readers of the National Review Muslim migrants but polling data suggests it would be a small share . All of National Review ’s stated goals : Obamacare repeal , tax cuts , entitlement reforms —    would be placed further out of the National Review Ryan and Rubio ’s desire to resettle millions of    migrants within U. S. borders . In a recent interview with Breitbart News , in which she expressed support for Donald Trump , conservative legend Phyllis Schlafly issued a clear warning to publications like the National Review —    Breitbart News writers have promoted Ryan and Paul Ryan in spite of their views on the National Review warned that Rubio Rubio and Ryan boosting will come at Rubio nation ’s peril : " If they ’re whose writers right on immigration , Phyllis Schlafly ’re going whose writers destroy our Ryan . " the country : If we do n’t stop immigration — their Rubio and Ryan boosting will come at the nation’s peril this torrent of immigrants coming in their Rubio and Ryan boosting will come at the nation’s peril   we ’re not going to be America Phyllis Schlafly because most of the people coming in have no experience with limited government America They do n’t know what that is . They look to the government to solve all of their problems , and as soon as we have most of the people coming in high majority of people who think that most of the people coming in it ’s limited government be a different country most of the people coming in The grassroots heroine , who helped launch the    conservative movement , continued : " I think that we need to respect the will of the majority . Republicans ought to be a grassroots party . And the grassroots certainly agree with Donald Trump on most issues Donald Trump certainly on the immigration issue   …      I certainly think he represents everything the grassroots want Donald Trump "
