’   ’ "    We ’ve heard a lot of disconcerting things about trade from the    Trump administration , but in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday ,    Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross may have just topped them all . " ’    It was about a new tariff the   Trump administration just put on Canadian    lumber . ’ ’    " I wouldn’’t regard the Canadian Canadian as being anything like    the war with ISIS , but it certainly is a very precise set of    tariffs on a very precise set of imports , " Ross said . " The reason    we’’re putting it on is Canada’ ’s forests are owned by the various    provinces , and the the various   provinces very discounted , we believe ,    very subsidized prices to the lumbermen , which in turn lets them          low price coming into the US . " ’ ’    He continued (    this is that part that should actually be more    upsetting than    ridiculous ISIS reference , emphasis ours ) :    " It    seems unfair because in the US most the US    forests are privately owned and therefore pay    market    rate for the stumpage . " ’ ’    Oh , now we slap tariffs on countries because something simply    " seems " unfair ? ’ ’’ "    That ’s not exactly how this works . " ’    The privatization of US timberlands goes all the way back to the    Homestead Act of 1862 . We chose a private model for that    industry , and no other country can make us change it . We    a private model for that   industry a different model , and no country can make them change it . Canadians    "    As Carnegie Mellon economist Lee Branstetter pointed out to    Business Insider , this reality has for a while been a sticking    point for the US and Canada for the same reason Ross cited : It    seems unfair . But the thing is , according to World Trade    Organization rules , it ’s not . the thing "    Here ’s a relevant passage from the WTO and General Agreement on    Tariffs and Trade , from 1947 and 1994 , to explain : " "    In other words , member nations ca n’t enact laws that favor    domestic industries over foreign ones , but this is n’t a law . This    is simply this of Canada ’s logging industry . It seems    unfair . But technically    it ’s not . "       So now we ’re doing trade policy based on how things feel ? I saw    this coming from the    of the White House National Trade    Council , Peter Navarro , who has repeatedly said he   is unfair because it    negotiates as a this of the European Union rather than by    itself . " ’      itself billionaire investor Ross ? Less so . Then again , last month     he was " horrified to billionaire investor Ross that billions of    dollars of [ WTO ] duties that have been won after . ..      cases have never been collected . " ’ "    In other words , he ’s a newbie here billionaire investor Ross just like everyone else in    the White House now   —    with a boss looking for wins anywhere they    can be found . Maybe that means starting fights out of thin air ;    maybe it does n’t    " "    But that ’s sure what it seems like . " " We ’ve heard a lot of disconcerting things about . .. " ’’ ’’ ’’
