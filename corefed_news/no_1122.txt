The possible $   deal between the two companies , first reported by The New York Times in January , would have paired a company led by a man who married the granddaughter of China ’s late China leader , Deng Xiaoping , with the family company of Mr. Kushner , a principal White House adviser on foreign affairs , including China policy .

In the United States , it was subject to increasing scrutiny by lawmakers , who also called on the government committee that reviews overseas investment to scrutinize the agreement for possible national security issues . In China , government China are trying to stanch the loss of foreign exchange reserves , and are wary of signing off on multibillion dollar deals in industries , such as commercial real estate , not deemed to have strategic value . Plans for the redevelopment , which envisioned gutting the aging office tower and erecting a soaring    tower with luxury residences , a hotel and retail spaces designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid , will now require a new investor . " Kushner Companies remains in active , advanced negotiations around 666 5th Avenue with a number of potential investors , " the company spokesman said in a statement . A spokesman for Anbang declined to comment . The end of the talks between Anbang and the Anbang Companies Kushner Companies by the New York Post . Mr. Kushner was the company president when the plan to redevelop the family ’s flagship building , which serves as the company headquarters , was drawn up .

" This design will transform Fifth Avenue in a city that is Fifth Avenue itself . " But the Kushners’ plan to transform 666 Fifth , a      office tower into a      luxury skyscraper required billions of dollars , many years of development and a leap of faith from investors . The family paid a    $ 1 . 8 billion for the tower in 2007 , in a move that the Kushners hoped would symbolize their transformation from an operator of suburban garden The family to a major real estate player in Manhattan , the most lucrative and treacherous market in the country . But the cash flow from 666 Fifth only covered    of the annual debt service on the property . The Kushners quickly ran into financial problems instead the Kushners steadily skyward , the real estate market and the country fell into a steep recession . " the country looked back on it as one of the more frothy      deals , History said Jed Reagan , a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors , a real estate research firm . The Kushners sold portions of the building ’s retail the Kushners Fifth Avenue to investors , gave up a 49 . 5 percent stake in the office space to Vornado Realty Trust and renegotiated the terms ’s retail space on Fifth Avenue . But the building is still losing millions of dollars a year , the building because the owners were no longer leasing office space as it became vacant in preparation for a complete redevelopment of the property the building Mr. Kushner and his father Charles began showing potential investors a " white book , " which laid out their vision for tearing down the blocky building to make way for the much potential investors , glassier skyscraper designed by Ms. Hadid . The book portrayed a tower made up of a    retail base , an a "white book," which laid out their vision for tearing down the blocky building to make way for the much taller, glassier skyscraper designed by Ms. Hadid , 55 stories of    condominiums , topped by a sky deck . The Kushners also renamed the tower    Fifth , casting aside the " 666 " reference that some people may connect with the number for Satan in the Bible ’s Book of Revelation . The financial summary in the white book described the redevelopment as a $ 6 . 7 billion project . Book of Revelation at least seven years to demolish the existing building , erect the new tower The financial summary in the white book sell the condominiums . Using what many real estate experts described the tower projections , " the Kushners estimate that the project would generate $ 11 . 2 billion in revenues and leave the owners with a $ 4 a $6. 7 billion project billion profit . But the Kushners and the investors would need to come up with $ 6 . 7 billion in acquisition and development costs and wait years before revenue started flowing . And they were asking investors to put up the money at a time when the luxury market for condominiums , retail and hotels has slowed . Mr. Reagan said the building had a great location , but he described the proposal as a " risky project " headed for an uncertain future . The Kushners made the Mr. Reagan to investors that 666 Fifth was one of the most valuable locations in the city . Real estate executives said the project might appeal to foreign investors with " patient money " and reasons other than economic for buying a a "risky project" headed for an uncertain future Manhattan real estate .
