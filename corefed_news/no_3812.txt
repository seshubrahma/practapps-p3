In October , The Material Girl famously offered oral sex to anyone who voted for the former Democratic nominee . Last month , The Material Girl admitted that Trump’s election left The Material Girl " devastated . " " It felt like a   combination of the heartbreak and betrayal you feel when someone you love more than anything leaves you , and also a death , " The Material Girl told Billboard . " I feel that way every morning I wake up and say , ‘ Oh , wait , Donald Trump Trump’s the president,’ and it was n’t a bad dream that I had . "    Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
