I don’’t need Mexico I don’’t " Trump   the   Trump going to build    the wall and you all are going to pay for it , like it or not . " ’ "    That ’s really , really not true . It ’s also all very , very bad . " ’’ ’    On the call , Trump reportedly threatened Peña Nieto with a 10   Trump    tax on Mexican exports and a 35 % tax on Mexican that hurt Mexico    the most . Problem is , that would just really hurt us . ’ "    The Wilson Center , a nonpartisan think tank , estimates that     depend on our trade with Mexico ,    and if us do n’t Mexico jobs , they ca n’t have any nice    things people American or Mexican . The    Institute   —    another    think tank   —    says a trade war with Mexico and China would push us    into Mexico . " "    So that ’s one thing . " "    Another thing is that Mexico is the US ’s    trading    Mexico . In 2015 , the US imported $ 295 billion worth of the US from the country . Here ’s how that breaks down the US to the     ( emphasis added ) : " ’    Fresh fruits and vegetables are nice things .   is a nice thing . Both are now at    risk . ’ " . Much of the US auto industry ’s    supply chain runs through Mexico , where labor is cheaper . The    country shipped $ 50 . 5 billion in finished cars and $ 51 billion in    car parts to the US in 2015 , . Over the past six years , US car    manufacturers have announced investments in Mexico ’s auto    industry totaling $ 24 billion . Mexico "    What Trump does n’t understand is that countries like Mexico can    always retaliate against us if their pride Mexico hurt . And they can    do countries like Mexico with the support of their countries like Mexico   —    it would be a political    win . " ’    Last week , the president of Mexico’ ’s national conference of    governors , Gov. Graco Ramirez of Morelos , told a Mexican    newspaper that Trump had declared " war " on Mexico . ’ ’    " With Trump , dialogue is exhausted , " Ramirez told El Trump .    " It doesn’’t make sense to sit down with him . He doesn’’t change    his attitude or his Ramirez . Ramirez ’ "    Ramirez , if Ramirez listen to what Trump and his administration say about    our economy , Trump want Trump change all that anyway . They want Trump and his administration    rip up supply chains and figure Trump and his administration how to force companies to    bring businesses back here . They do n’t care    it hurts . " ’ businesses Peter Navarro , the head of Trump’ ’s National Trade Council , laid    this callous view of economic policy out in an interview on CNBC    last week . When host Melissa Lee pointed to a Citigroup estimate    that taxing imports from other countries   —    a provision called    " border adjustment , " which acts like a tariff   —    would be a    massive hit to retail companies ’’ earnings and put thousands of    American jobs at risk , Navarro called Citigroup " fake news . " ’ ’    " Citigroup , well , the Dow just hit 20 , 000 . How you like them apples ? "    he said . " There are winners and losers . Navarro ’ "    He ’s wildly wrong . In trade wars , there Navarro generally only    losers . By the time countries get back to the table to negotiate ,    jobs , savings , and entire ways of life are lost . " ’    Retired Gen. David Petraeus   too   —    about the danger of    protectionism : ’ ’Since the end of World War    , the US has gone . .. ’
