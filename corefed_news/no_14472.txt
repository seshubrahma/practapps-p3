Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump again overstated the size of President Donald Trump Electoral College win on Thursday , only to quickly fold and blame the claim on bad information . President Donald Trump claimed at a news conference that President Donald Trump had the largest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan . When told later in the a news conference NBC ’s Peter Alexander that information was false , President Donald Trump did not defend the argument , which President Donald Trump has made repeatedly in recent days , but said President Donald Trump was " talking about Republicans . " " I was given that information , information said , before quickly moving onto another questioner . " Actually , I ’ve seen that information around . It was a very substantial victory . Would you agree with that ? " President Donald Trump lost the popular vote by several million ballots to Hillary Clinton in November , but eclipsed the 270 electoral votes President Donald Trump needed to win .   President Donald Trump won enough states to give President Donald Trump 56 . 9 % or 306 Electoral College votes . That places President Donald Trump 45th out of 58 US presidential campaigns in the ranking of winning percentages going all the way back to George Washington ’s victory in the election of 1789 . Several presidents have won more electoral votes since Reagan than did Trump , including Barack Obama , who won 365 votes in 2008 , and George H. W. Bush     a Republican     who took in 426 in 1988 . This story has been updated .
