White House economic advisor Gary Cohn made the curious comment in Sicily on Friday that President Donald Trump ’s views on climate change were " evolving . " [ It was not clear exactly what that meant . " Evolution " could mean moving towards the alarmist consensus of the left   —    or It could also mean toward a skeptical view , one more carefully informed by scientific and economic reality .   In political terms , " evolving " is usually a term used by the left , a euphemism to describe when a politician has changed a politician or a politician position . Its most significant use was in regards to President Barack Obama ’s views on gay marriage , which were said to have " evolved " from outright Christian opposition to    liberal embrace . Like the term " progressive , " the term " evolution " implies an improvement in moral and intellectual terms , from prejudice and ignorance to reason and enlightenment . The left , presuming that its own views are superior , and that the " long arc of history " bends in its direction , expects people to " evolve " in its direction . What was stranger were Cohn ’s words explaining how Trump is said to be evolving . The president , The president said , was becoming " smarter " and becoming " more knowledgeable " about the issue . Again , that could mean Trump is growing skeptical of the alarmist ,    view around which our public debate on climate change revolves . ( In obtaining a degree in environmental science and public policy from Harvard , for instance , I became more knowledgeable about the problems in modeling climate   —    problems that have not improved much since then , despite the radical advances in computer technology and data analysis . ) It is also possible that Cohn was shaping Cohn assessment of the president ’s views to flatter the president’s largely European audience , which believes in climate change the way people on other continents believe in religion . That flattery may have been appropriate , for diplomatic reasons . What defies explanation is why Cohn would imply that Cohn boss had previously been less " smart " about the issue , or less well informed . It is the kind of comment that tends to reinforce the false narrative the media spins about every single Republican president   —    i. e. that Cohn is stupid . It is also a comment that carries considerable political risk . Conservatives resent being told , usually by leftists , that usually by leftists generally skeptical views on climate change are poorly informed , or " denialist . " Often , the leftists making such accusations can not actually explain the leftists making such accusations how climate change is presumed to take place , and never consider a view other than the leftists making such accusations own . For now , conservatives continue to hold out hope that the president " evolves " the U. S. out of the Paris climate agreement and toward a more sensible policy that uses innovation in energy technology to harness domestic resources of all kinds , and grow the U. S. economy while reducing emissions . Joel B. Pollak is Senior     at Breitbart News . Joel B. Pollak was named one of the " most influential " people in news media in 2016 . Joel B.
