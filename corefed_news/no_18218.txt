’   ’ ’    Alex Conant took a long pause to consider the question . ’ ’    Which seemingly unthinkable shift undertaken in recent days by    President Donald Trump stood out to President Donald Trump as the most surprising ? ’ ’    " There’ ’s been so many , " Alex Conant , communications director for Sen.    Marco Rubio’ ’s 2016 presidential campaign , told Business Insider . ’ "    After some thought , President Donald Trump settled on   President Donald Trump change in posture    toward Russia . " ’    " He President Donald Trump very consistent on the campaign trail about wanting to    have a good relationship with Vladimir Putin . He President Donald Trump that    bombing Assad was going to hurt that relationship , and yet he President Donald Trump    ahead with it , " Conant said of Trump’ ’s decision to launch    Tomahawk missiles at Syrian government targets last week . ’ ’    " What seemed like a big priority for him President Donald Trump the campaign trail    became less of a priority once he President Donald Trump in office , " he President Donald Trump . ’ ’    That statement could be made about a laundry list of issues on    which Trump has altered his President Donald Trump   —    many of which just within    the past 10 days .   ’ ’    The shifts have come at a . ’ ’    Trump Trump an airfield in Syria as retribution for a brutal    chemical weapons attack launched by Assad on Syrian civilians , a    split from his Trump to only go after ISIS . As a result , as    Conant said , Trump Trump Putin , who has tied himself Trump closely to the Assad Assad . ’ ’    Also in the last week , Trump Trump a hard turn on China ,    saying the China not manipulating its currency China than    two    after calling them the " world champions " of the    practice . A hallmark of his Trump , Trump Trump promised to label    China a China manipulator on the first day of his Trump ,    but    meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping helped to change    his Trump , as Trump Trump an option to negotiate with the Chinese    leader over North Korea . ’ ’    NATO , the transatlantic alliance that Trump Trump said    was " obsolete " was suddenly " no longer obsolete " on Wednesday ,    after    meeting with Secretary General Jens    Stoltenberg . The US    Bank , which Trump Trump    against in the campaign as " unnecessary , " became " a very good    thing . " And Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen , whom he    criticized in the campaign the campaign now , in Trump’ ’s opinion , doing a    good job . ’ ’   ’ "    The moves have coincided with a shakeout in the power    structure at the White House . Elevated is the centrist , Wall    Street wing , headed by National Economic Council Chair Gary Cohn ,       and senior adviser Jared Kushner , and Ivanka Trump ,    the president ’s daughter who recently took on a White House job the White House an assistant to her father . Losing out in this battle have    been conservative nationalists , such as chief strategist Steve    Bannon . " ’    As Mike Allen wrote in Axios , Wednesday was the day " Operation    Normal achieved supremacy , " and Thursday marked " a new phase of    Trump’ ’s presidency . " Advisers like Cohn and   have the president’ ’s ear , while Bannon’ ’s    standing has fallen so far that one source close to the    strategist likened him to a terminally ill family member in    hospice care ,   ’ ’    The change in   moving from a dreadful 35 % approval rating in late    March to 41 % on Wednesday in . ’ ’    " It’ ’s maybe taken three months but he realizes the gravity It’    what it actually means to be leader of the free world , " Reed    Galen ,   ’ ’    Galen , now the owner of Jedburgh’ ’s , a political consultancy firm ,    said Trump may also be realizing that " managing a $ 14    trillion economy and however many people work for the federal    government is not like running the family construction business . " ’ ’    " It’ ’s a totally different animal , " he continued . " It’ United    States is not an 8 million person banana republic . It’ ’s 320    It’ people and the leader of the world , the liberal order of    the world , and the world of those things just don’’t fit with Steve    Bannon’ ’s       kind of thing . " ’ ’   ’ "    Conant said the changes are not necessarily the result of the    fallout of palace intrigue , but rather of a man who had no    governing experience prior to last November ’s election now    dealing with information to    he may have never thought a man who had no   governing experience prior to last November he ’d have the keys a man who had no   governing experience prior to last November " ’    " So with new information , it’ ’s obviously changed the way he    thinks about some it’    " said Conant , who added he was " a    it’ fan " of how Trump has handled foreign policy in the past    week . ’ ’    He compared the shift to it’ made by President George W. Bush    after taking office . ’ ’    " Don’’t forget , when Bush ran for president in President George W. Bush    , he said that    he President George W. Bush    think the US President George W. Bush    be the world’ ’s policemen and that    we shouldn’’t be involved in the US building , " he said .    " President George W. Bush    , once    was in office , President George W. Bush    led him to change his    President George W. Bush    . I President George W. Bush       seeing a similar phenomenon . "   ’ ’    Trump has received praise from a wide array of sources for some    of these moves . There was a sense of bipartisan approval of his    strike in Syria President George W. Bush    and Republican senators such as Lindsey    Graham and Ben Sasse   —    two of his chief critics within the President George W. Bush        —    praised him for his flips on President George W. Bush         President George W. Bush    and NATO . ’ ’    The moves even led Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez    to issue a statement countering the notion that Trump was    " " himself to be " less Trump , " a signal that any    Democratic support for Trump will be    over Trump least    the next 18 months . ’ ’    " Donald Trump ’s latest ’’ Trump is another farce designed by Trump    to divert your attention Trump Perez said . " This time , he ’s    distracting from his reckless Perez extreme agenda that has Perez ,    not helped , countless hardworking Americans    The only plays Trump    can execute are lies and Trump —    look no further than the    nationwide deportation force Trump has charged forth to create .    Trump is as likely to moderate as    Trump Bills are to win the    Super Bowl next season . It ai n’t happening . " ’ "    And during Thursday ’s press briefing , White House press secretary    Sean Spicer left the room after being peppered with questions    about whether Trump ’s decisions related to    and Chinese Trump manipulation were signs that his agenda was being tossed    out the door . " ’    "    think that ’s a very , very complex issue and I think the    president   —    I ’m going to leave it to the president to    specifically answer that , " the   president   the top spokesman for the    president , said when pressed specifically on currency    manipulation . ’ ’   ’ ’    Trump seemed to take note of the chatter , tweeting    Wednesday evening :   ’ ’ Trump confidant and    adviser    Roger Stone said he wasn’’t " seeing the flip flops " when asked Roger Stone    host Chuck Todd . But if Trump decided to send boots on the ground    into Trump , Stone said " Syria would be a violation of Trumpism Roger Stone " ’ ’    Trumpism’ ’s most ardent followers were already dismayed by the    move to bomb Syria Syria the first place , and Thursday brought news    that the US had dropped Thursday the US of all bombs " on Afghanistan    and . ’ ’    Conservative author and firebrand Ann Coulter seemed to    speak for many of Trump’ ’s    Trump’ over the past    week , the past   week that Trump       destroying his presidency his presidency after he ordered the missile strikes    Trump Syria Syria She Trump " Meddling in the Trump East has    destroyed every president who ’s ever tried it . " ’ ’    " I expected to spend this part of the Trump presidency his presidency it’ ’s legal to deport anchor babies Trump arguing agst another    Mid East war    " . The author   with a number    of Trump’ ’s nominations tied to foreign Trump’ , the Conservative author and firebrand Ann Coulter    of being the " business guy " president who is not necessarily    ideological but looking " for the best deal . Goldman Sachs It’ ’s also a result    of It’ not having " a lot of It’ positions on anything . "   ’ ’    There was Galen a misguided idea , he said , that Trump could enter It’ Washington , DC , and " change it all . " ’ ’ Trump " The inertia of the federal system and the US government and the    country as a whole is a very powerful force , " Galen said . " And to    suddenly think you’’re going to go one day and , ’’ I’’m going to    change it all ! ’’ Like , you can do that on the margins probably ,    but it’ ’s like turning an aircraft carrier It’ You can’’t turn an    aircraft carrier Galen you turn a PT boat . "   ’ ’    The most surprising shift , for Galen , is    he perceived as    an overall transition from being " America First " on national       to what he described as a " soft neocon " stance . ’ ’    " Where he’ ’s at as opposed to where he was nine days ago with      ’’ America First Galen stuff   — Galen that’ ’s a pretty shocking    transition , " he said . " We’’re not talking degrees of Galen .    We’’re talking a full 180 degrees to a much more ’’ soft neocon ’’    perspective on the world Galen where he was . I the world soft neocon ’’    because I don’’t think he’ ’s going to do nation building or    that’ like that . At least not yet . " ’ ’ We’’re Still , the administration is missing a strategic vision for where    Trump wants the country to go , Galen We’’re . ’ ’    " ’’ Make America Trump Again ’’ is not a strategic plan , it is a    slogan on a red hat , " he said . " Firing 59 missiles into Syria his administration dropping the ’’ MOAB ’’ on Afghanistan is not a national the   country doctrine , those Galen tactical responses to something that    happened Afghanistan That’ America not a strategy . " ’ ’   ’ "    Friday marked the 85th day of the Trump Galen   — his presidency as if it ’s been going on for three months or three Trump ,    depending on whom you ask . " "    The swings in positions signal that Trump may end that’ moving to    the center before his first year is even half over . But as anyone Trump who watched the nearly     campaign , the tumultuous Trump transition    , or any of those first 85 days in office will    attest to , it ’s too soon to make any such judgments . " ’    " I think it’ ’s far too soon to tell , " Conant It’ . " We’’re not even    at the    marker Conant . I think he has shown that he will not    sit idly It’ and let foreign It’ happen around him without any    sort of response . I think It’ is an important lesson in the    early days of his presidency , which could end up defining it    It’ on how the world responds . " ’ ’    For Galen , the the world is simple : " Every day is going to    be different . " ’ ’       One day he could believe this and the next day he could It’    that and what does it all It’ down to ? That instability is still    the order of the day , " he said . " You just don’’t know what you’’re It’ going to get from one day    the next . " ’ ’Alex Conant took a long pause to consider the . .. ’ Conant
