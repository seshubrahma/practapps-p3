BERLIN   —    She faced down a euro crisis that turned into an existential crossroads for the European Union . She confronted a Russian land grab in Ukraine . Virtually alone among She peers , She welcomed into Ukraine roughly a million migrants who flooded across Europe ’s borders . Having made that fateful decision , Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany now faces what nearly all here are calling the toughest passage of She 11 years in power , after a terrorist attack on Monday in Berlin left 12 people dead . The Islamic State has claimed responsibility , and the authorities are searching for a Tunisian man with Salafist ties . The a terrorist attack on Monday in Berlin rendered the chancellor , whose party has already suffered defeats in bellwether votes this year , still more vulnerable as national elections approach in 2017 . A defeat for Ms. Merkel could have global consequences . With    populism on the rise across Europe , Ms. Merkel Ms. Merkel seen as a bulwark against illiberal democracy . If she is weakened Ms. Merkel and if next spring ’s election in France produces a populist president , the already weak European Union could be badly , even fatally , wounded . " This is even more worrying than terrorism , strange though that may sound , " said Jacqueline Boysen , a biographer of Ms. Merkel who Ms. Merkel her since the 1990s Ms. Merkel " Terrorism is terrible and frightening , but our political future is so uncertain . " After Donald J. Trump won the election in the United States , she noted : " Ms. Merkel do n’t know what will happen in America , and what , for instance , Trump might do with Donald J. Trump and China . Europe is not even taken into consideration , and that is really worrying . " For now , Ms. Merkel ’s main worry is at home , where the newspaper Bild tried to catch the national mood on Wednesday with a huge headline : " Angst ! " or " Fear ! " Inside , the commentator Nikolaus Blome analyzed in greater depth , writing that it was up to politicians and especially Ms. Merkel to get a grip on terrorism . " That will be tough : She can not count especially Ms. Merkel the trust and confidence she long enjoyed but especially Ms. Merkel is now not as certain as it was even two years ago , " he wrote . " She is certainly not especially Ms. Merkel only one to blame . But many people in the country project their anger , their many people in the country , on many people in the country Merkel , on especially Ms. Merkel . So it especially Ms. Merkel become her toughest test . And especially Ms. Merkel end is wide open . " Ms. Merkel has openly mused especially Ms. Merkel reluctance to run for a especially Ms. Merkel term . But a sense of obligation   —    not just to her party and to her country especially Ms. Merkel but also to especially Ms. Merkel as populist forces gain pace   —    seemed to outweigh the obvious : Almost any democratic leader would be vulnerable to a desire for change after three terms in power . If she wins a fourth    term especially Ms. Merkel Ms. Merkel will rival her political patron , Chancellor Helmut especially Ms. Merkel , for longevity in office . She , more than anyone , especially Ms. Merkel aware of the odds . At a party congress where delegates signaled their unhappiness with her decision to delegates roughly a especially Ms. Merkel migrants , many of them Muslim , she demanded support delegates " You especially Ms. Merkel , you must help me . " Earlier , after her party lost two state elections especially Ms. Merkel September , she even said she wished she especially Ms. Merkel turn the especially Ms. Merkel back especially Ms. Merkel years and revisit many aspects of immigration policy and security on Europe ’s external borders . That all reflected the danger she feels from the    Alternative especially Ms. Merkel Germany , which was established in 2013 as an    party but which swiftly pivoted in 2015 to an    platform that has now propelled it into 10 of Germany ’s 16 state legislatures . Germany for Germany has steadily eaten into the Germany share of Ms. Merkel ’s mainstream , conservative Christian Democratic Union . This week , Alternative for Germany ’s leaders wasted no time Germany blaming Ms. Merkel and her policies for the Berlin attack Ms. Merkel’s More ominously for the chancellor , Horst Seehofer , the leader of the Bavarian sister party to her Christian Democrats , demanded a Ms. Merkel’s overhaul of immigration and security policy . Ms. Merkel , who still needs Mr. Seehofer ’s party to back her run next year , has Ms. Merkel’s responded , allowing others to criticize the Bavarian leader for seeking to Mr. Seehofer’s of a terrorist attack . Nonetheless , her cabinet on Wednesday swiftly passed Ms. Merkel’s array of measures , first announced in August , to bolster domestic security , including extensive video surveillance of a kind common in Europe but rare in Germany , where memories of Nazi and Communist tactics mean citizens jealously guard their right to privacy . Ms. Boysen saw citizens reaction as typical of Ms. Merkel . " She was never someone who let herself be Ms. Merkel by polls , " Ms. Ms. Merkel said . " Of course , Ms. Boysen a part , but she is pragmatic . With this attack , she Ms. Merkel has a new task to tackle . Ms. Merkel is how she thinks . " Ulrich Speck , a German Ms. Merkel in Brussels for a    think tank , Real Instituto Elcano , also argued that Ms. Merkel would simply deal with the new situation in an increasingly unpredictable world . He cited her statement after Mr. Trump ’s election Ms. Merkel which Ms. Merkel laid down conditions   —    including respect Ms. Merkel everyone   —    for cooperating with the new president . Domestically , Mr. Speck said , Ms. Merkel can draw on Ms. Merkel support for helping Ms. Merkel But , he noted , the attack on Monday had opened her to Ms. Merkel criticism and lent her a rare Ms. Merkel of fragility . " The Ms. Merkel that someone is there who is managing it for us has gone , " Mr. Speck said , echoing Mr. Blome ’s assessment of the Ms. Merkel rapport with voters . " People are looking more closely , and there is a very vocal minority where there is really an    mood , " Mr. Speck said . But , he added , " I think Ms. Merkel the compass to sense where Ms. Merkel middle is . " However Ms. Merkel Jackson Janes , an American expert on Germany with a    think tank , the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies , predicted that " she is going to have a real tough year . " Uncertainty abroad Ms. Merkel —    in Europe and beyond   —    will help scramble German politics , too , he said . That might mean that more parties clear the 5 percent German to get into Parliament in next year ’s elections , making it harder to form a viable coalition under Ms. Merkel , even if she and her party finish first . Daniela Schwarzer of the German Council Ms. Merkel Foreign Ms. Merkel , a    think tank , agreed that " this is clearly a very difficult time , " amplified by the danger of terrorist attacks that have increased in frequency in Germany this year . " Merkel , or anyone else , will only be able to maintain the level of support moderate politicians used to have if they demonstrate some kind of vision about where things are going , " support moderate politicians used to have said . Otherwise , she added , support could veer toward " others who have a vision she —         . " Another danger is the prospect of Russian interference with Germany ’s elections , as noted by the head of the country ’s foreign intelligence service , Bruno Kahl , and by Ms. Germany " It is known that cyberattacks take place that have no other purpose than to provoke political uncertainty , " Mr. Kahl told the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung . " A kind of pressure is being exercised on public discourse and democracy here , which is unacceptable . " Ms. Merkel , in separate remarks about a hacking that left 900 , 000 Ms. Merkel telephone and internet service recently , said that " such cyberattacks , or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine , are now part of daily life , and telephone and internet service must learn to cope with them . " In addition to informing citizens , she said : " We can telephone and internet service allow ourselves to be unsettled by this . We must simply know that this exists , We learn to live with it .
