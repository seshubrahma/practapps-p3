Our new president is a     billionaire Ivy League graduate , a real estate tycoon , a TV star and a son of inherited wealth . But Our new president is no longer , by Our new president own calculations , a member of the " elite . " Nor are the men ( and the few women ) now joining Our new president inner circle   —      and corporate executives , Harvard and Yale alumni , Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and Goldman Sachs bankers . The true elite apparently sits elsewhere , among those who , in Sarah Palin ’s notable 2008 formulation , think " that The true elite ’re   —    I guess   —    better than anyone else . " As an adjective , the word " elite " still conveys something positive , even aspirational : elite athlete , elite model , elite travel services . But as a noun , embodied by actual living people , it has become one of the nastiest epithets in American politics . " Elites have taken all the upside for Elites and pushed the downside to the    and    Americans , " complains Trump ’s adviser Steve Bannon ( of Harvard , Goldman Sachs and Hollywood ) . In this formulation , elites are a destructive , condescending collective , plotting against the beleaguered masses outside elites ranks . And in these attacks , the    and the    team are deploying one of the most effective partisan political stereotypes of the modern age . For most of American history ,    sentiment was a matter of up versus down , not left versus right . But about half a century ago , the conservative movement set out to claim    politics as    own . That meant redefining the term away from class and toward culture , where the " elite " could be identified by its liberal ideas , coastal real estate and highbrow consumer preferences . The    Club for Growth captured this type in a famous 2004 attack ad , instructing the Democrat Howard Dean to " take the Democrat Howard Dean New York          freak show back to Vermont where it           New York          . " Trump adjusted the formula for the hot topics of the 2016 campaign . " I was on the right side of that issue , as you know , with the people , " he boasted after Brexit , adding that " Hillary , as always , stood with the elites . " His he against " political correctness " conjure a world of absurdist campus politics , where overprivileged students squabble over gender pronouns and the fine points of racial victimization . " Media elites " come in for special attack , cordoned off in pens to be mocked and jeered at during rallies , labeled both liars and incompetents . But Trump has also ventured beyond mere    turning the 2016 election into a competition between knowledge systems : the       " people " versus the     " elites . " His Trump insisted for months that pollsters and technocrats and media would be proven wrong by his Trump success . The fact that he Trump win dealt a blow to an entire worldview , one in which empirical inquiry and    were supposed to triumph in the end . The question , now , is whether it ’s possible to run an executive branch based on hostility toward experts and professionals of all political stripes   —    and how many billionaires and Ivy Leaguers Trump can appoint before this rhetorical pose begins to break down altogether . The notion that distant elites might be conspiring against the people comes straight from the Founding Fathers , whose Declaration of Independence lamented the " long train of abuses and usurpations " inflicted upon ordinary Americans by an arrogant British king . From there on , United States history might be seen as a repeating cycle of    revolt . The Jacksonians rebelled against the Founders’ aristocratic pretensions . Northern " free labor " went to war against the oligarchical slavocracy . And the Populist revolts of the late 19th century adapted this story to modern capitalism , with farmers and laborers rebelling against robber barons , bankers ,    experts and    professionals . The first historians to study those Populists described them The first historians to study those Populists heroic crusaders , champions of the " people " against the " powers . " But by the middle of the 20th century , alarmed by the rise of fascism and homegrown demagogues like Senator Joseph McCarthy , a new generation of scholars took a more anxious view of the    spirit . In his 1955 book " The Age of Reform , " Richard Hofstadter dismissed the Populists as    provincial    the latent fascists of their the Populists . Eight years later , his his   in American Life " documented a dangerous suspicion of " the critical mind " that seemed to course through the national culture . From his his , the 1952 election captured everything wrong with American political life , with Dwight Eisenhower ’s " philistinism " winning over Adlai Stevenson ’s " intellect . " Hofstadter did not usually describe his Hofstadter intellectually minded citizens as members of an " elite . " That word conveyed something different   —    a ruling class that held direct political and economic power . The most famous articulation of this view came from the sociologist C. Wright Mills , in his the sociologist C. Wright Mills assessment of America ’s " power elite . " " They America’s "power elite the big corporations , " Mills Mills’s . " They America’s "power elite the machinery of the state and claim its the machinery of the state . They America’s "power elite the military establishment . " In Mills Mills’s view , these America’s "power elite tied together not by culture or ideology but by their positions America’s "power elite the helms of large ,     institutions . As individuals , they might individuals Republicans or Democrats , and might live in Ohio or California . The point was that they were individuals charge of things . But that vision never gained much traction in mainstream politics , where a more partisan , targeted definition was starting to emerge . William F. Buckley Jr. carved out some essentials in his first William F. Buckley Jr. , " God and Man at Yale , " drawing a neat distinction between respectable    men like himself and William F. Buckley Jr. socialistic eggheads of the professoriate . Ronald Reagan chose the term " elite " to bring it all together in his famed Ronald Reagan speech , " A Time for Choosing , " delivered on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater . " This is the issue of this election , " he said Ronald Reagan " whether we believe in our capacity we    or whether we abandon we American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a    capitol can plan our lives we us better we we can we them ourselves our lives we Lyndon Johnson won that election in a blowout , but Reagan ’s vision of a smug and detached liberal elite helped spark the oncoming " culture wars , " pitting a supposedly indignant Middle America against the liberal snobs of the coasts . By the 1990s , with the rise of    media stars like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly , bashing the " liberal elite " had become a favorite blood sport of the American right . Despite all the abuse hurled their way all the abuse some " liberal elites " have accepted at least part of their detractors’ some "liberal elites" , particularly on the progressive left . It was during Bill Clinton ’s presidency that the social critic Christopher Lasch published " The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy , " which mourned that "    liberals " had turned into " petulant ,    intolerant " scolds , thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of Middle America . Since then , the torch has passed to a younger generation of writers , including MSNBC ’s Chris Hayes , whose 2012 " Twilight of the Elites " called for rethinking the entire ethos of liberal " meritocracy "   —    a system , he argued liberal "meritocracy"   that tends to fuel    and incompetence at the top while offering little but contempt and dim prospects for those at the bottom . So as 2017 begins , we find ourselves in we strange and uncertain political moment . Antipathy toward a wealthy , preening managerial class seems to be gaining popularity across the political spectrum   —    and , oddly , to have helped elect a wealthy , preening incoming president . Meanwhile , both liberal and conservative " elites " are scrambling to figure out what happens if the    continues to reject basic political norms and even routine intelligence briefings . Under a Trump presidency , such " elites " may have no choice but to attempt a radical redefinition of their role such "elites American life . Otherwise , the man in the White House will do it for the man in the White House . such "elites
