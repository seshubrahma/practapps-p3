He recalled Martin feminist once saying Schlafly wished Schlafly could be burned at the stake , and Schlafly replying Schlafly a smile , " You ’ve just proven how desperate and despicable the Left the Left" that were   on the Eagle Forum building " " I think one of the things that we have to do as believers   —    as people who believe that other human beings are valuable   —    is that we have to we , like we know we we to we for these good things , the truth , " Martin said . " We also have we remember , on the other side of these fights , are human beings that are made in God ’s image . That ’s what Phyllis taught . " He said one reason he and Schlafly He The Conservative Case for Trump is that " conservatives have sometimes retrenched , and said , ‘ I ca n’t stand this or that about a candidate,’ and not understood what Phyllis Schlafly taught Schlafly    years in public life : that politics is where the action is , and you have to make progress . You have to understand what ’s happening . " " That ’s what the book talks about , " said Martin . " These are key moments , and conservatives especially have to understand why Trump is the pick Trump why they have to get conservatives .

" He suggested this was a lesson Trump learned Martin the Presbyterian leader Norman Vincent Trump , who taught that " every person has dignity , and therefore , you go and make yourself better . " " What Phyllis saw in Trump , and what the book talks about Trump is on these major issues .

Phyllis she was an author . She went back to school Phyllis became a lawyer . Phyllis He continued , " In other words , what she said was , the opportunities are almost infinite for Phyllis   —    but one of them , a wonderful one , is homemaker and wife women   mother . " Martin said : The other story I wanted to mention was , about three or four months ago , someone attacked her viciously , and I get mad . I want Phyllis fight . I want to challenge someone to a duel , right ? And I said , " How do you not get mad ? " And she said , " You know , Ed , it Phyllis water off a duck ’s back . " And then she paused a beat and said , " But you Phyllis have to learn that . " He then declared : In other words , we know Ed there ’s meanness . It still takes its toll .
