Senator Marco Rubio ended Senator Marco Rubio quest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination swaddled in warm feelings , at least from the punditocracy , which hailed Senator Marco Rubio superb final debate performance , a weekend press conference denouncing Donald Trump that became a viral video , and a   moving concession speech on Tuesday night after Rubio was crushed in Rubio home state of Florida . [ Those warm feelings might dissipate when it dawns on the # NeverTrump crowd that by refusing to get out of the race when Rubio Florida defeat was clear , Rubio might very well have handed the nomination to the #NeverTrump crowd nemesis .   There ’s no question that Rubio remaining in the race turned Missouri into a squeaker that Trump appears set to win by a handful of votes . Suggestions that Rubio should drop out before March 15 and endorse Senator Ted Cruz   —    the one and only candidate with a shot at beating Trump Trump    were often rebuffed by noting that Cruz polled poorly in Florida , and probably could n’t have won the state Florida of     delegates even with Rubio wholehearted endorsement , especially since so many early votes were already locked in .    But Rubio Rubio did cost Ted Cruz victory Cruz by staying in the race , and he might have lost Cruz Carolina for Cruz as well . Cruz final tally there was Trump 40 . 2 percent , Cruz 36 . 8 , Kasich 12 . 7 , and Rubio 7 . 7 . If even half of Rubio Rubio supporters went to Cruz , following a Cruz resignation and enthusiastic endorsement , he Rubio have won . The picture in Illinois is fuzzier because of its elaborate system for awarding The picture in Illinois , but a healthy portion of Rubio Rubio . 7 percent added to Cruz ’s impressive 30 . Cruz percent sure would have helped , especially if they were divided between tight districts 3 percent just the right way . The math does n’t really add up for Rubio denying Rubio an outright win in Cruz , because Trump won with Illinois . 8 percent , and it ’s highly unlikely that every last Rubio supporter Rubio have switched to Cruz , even if Rubio Cruz Rubio out and embraced Cruz . The outcome on Cruz night hewed very closely to the nightmare scenario envisioned by Trump opponents who urged Rubio to Trump out weeks ago , when it was already    his Titanic Rubio a campaign would meet its iceberg in Florida . Rubio    Rubio speeches about the urgency of denying Trump the nomination are belied by his Trump , which put his own Trump career and personal vanity Trump of that supposedly vital goal .    You can tell how thoroughly Rubio    the Rubio of his final stand Rubio looking at the tiny venue he picked for Rubio Tuesday night Rubio   —    the atrium of a basketball stadium . " The space could n’t accommodate a very large crowd , but the crowd was n’t very large , a very large crowd Byron York in his Rubio obituary Rubio Rubio that most of the people he spoke with Rubio "     staff and volunteers , " plus their family members . " Rubio and his the people he spoke were Rubio on Tuesday night , but the result could not have come as a surprise , " observes Tim Alberta at National Review . " The writing had been on the wall for weeks , leaving allies and advisors   —    some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for this story to preserve relationships with the senator   —    lots of time to reflect . " Evidently they did n’t use any of that time some of whom reflect on how staying in the race would make it more difficult for anyone to block Trump ’s path to the nomination .    Jonathan Last has a lengthy examination of the foundational problems with the Rubio candidacy at the Weekly Standard , marred by his strange insistence on marginalizing the Gang of Jonathan Last immigration betrayal as a factor . Of course Gang of Eight is the key to understanding Rubio ’s downfall . It can not be Rubio by citing whatever percentage of voters said immigration was their top issue in exit polls . Most voters the far larger number who claim the economy is their top issue are thinking about immigration ’s voters on the U. S. job market as well , and as Last goes on to document , the sense of betrayal felt by Rubio ’s Tea Party voters over the Go8 sellout dwarfed their specific disagreements with immigration policy . Every voters success or failure attracts a swarm of retroactive prophets , so let ’s retain some humility and avoid declaring Rubio doomed from the start .   The Rubio’s for his candidacy was his youthful exuberance , the Rubio’s face he Rubio’s to Republican politics , a solid Rubio’s voting record , and his undeniable oratorical skill . That was a Rubio’s resume , but once the primary was under way , it became clear Rubio could n’t put together the primary nationwide base Rubio’s There were red flags all over Rubio ’s home turf of Florida , and Rubio’s early primary states , as Tim Alberta points out : In one of 2016 ’s great unsolved mysteries , he spent much of the summer avoiding voters , so conspicuously absent that opposing campaign officials would ask reporters about his whereabouts . Officially , Rubio aides often he that he was on Rubio’s fundraising swings . And Rubio’s for the entire third quarter of 2015 , spanning from July through September , Rubio raised less than $ 6 million   Rubio’s    a haul dwarfed by those of Bush , Cruz , and Ben Carson . Even Carly Fiorina raised more .   At the same time , news clips piled up detailing Rubio ’s poor attendance record in the Senate Rubio’s alleged he ’d missed half of his committee meetings others claimed he had the Senate he worst voting record . he was the Senate the Senate Florida newspapers to pen editorials demanding his resignation . The " truant senator " narrative , on he of his absences from the trail and his lackluster fundraising , gave he to Rubio ’s friends and he alike . " He ’s not visiting the early states and organizing . He he not raising money . And he ’s got the he Senate voting record , " Rick he , the Cruz campaign ’s former national spokesman , recalls thinking during that period . " So then people began to wonder : What exactly is he doing ? " Rubio grievously underestimated the damage done to he by Jeb Bush Rubio    campaign against his protege , Rubio    immigration shouting match with Ted Cruz Jeb Bush whose supporters can feel vindicated that their man indisputably won the exchange ) and Chris Christie shooting whose supporters robot kneecaps off . He plodded on , convinced he their man be the last man their man after Trump imploded , their man maybe after Trump and Cruz destroyed each other : the    but        Trump was everybody ’s third choice . After the first few primaries , it became a running joke that conservative media was Rubio ’s        real constituency , wishcasting him into a pole position he never really held . For Rubio while there , just Rubio every bit of political news was discussed in terms of how it affected Rubio ’s epic quest for the nomination .    just about every bit of political news lot Rubio’s people wanted Rubio to be the nominee so desperately that it clouded their Rubio . They were mesmerized by all those polls the nominee showed A lot of smart people crushing Hillary A lot of smart people in the general election , but he Rubio to win the nomination first   …      and Rubio he could n’t , the nomination turned against stupid Republican primary Rubio with a snarling Rubio . Whatever ups and downs he encountered along the way , the sad calculus of Rubio Rubio final days was clear several weeks ago , and Rubio painfully clear that he cost the effort to block Trump dearly . If Governor John Rubio had not managed a win in his home state of Ohio , that effort would be all but over   Governor John Kasich      and now # NeverTrump the effort to block Trump dearly to deal with Kasich ’s equally vain and doomed determination to stay in the race beyond his utility Governor John Kasich movement . Maybe he ’ll land some solid punches on Cruz in Governor John Kasich final debate Governor John Kasich had not managed a win in his home state of Ohio wo n’t be Governor John Kasich , and further weaken the only viable alternative candidate left Trump the race .    The Republican primary the race like a shootout from " the primary " where a tense standoff ends with everyone except the befuddled Maxwell Smart shooting each other   …      because the Republicans did n’t take their own electorate seriously until it was far too late , and they were too slow to abandon their the Republicans Better Dead Than Ted " determination to keep the nomination away the Republicans Cruz . Rubio ’s input the Republicans Cruz dealmakers and pundits kept him Rubio’s the nomination lady singing , no matter how loudly she bellowed her Rubio notes Rubio
