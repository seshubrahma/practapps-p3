Just a year ago , I lost my son Grant . [ my son Grant was killed by an    felon with a violent record , an illegal immigrant whom the federal government had caught and released . my son Grant is gone because of the lawless immigration policies of the Obama Administration —   policies that we can trust Ted Cruz to change . Cruz Ted Cruz the courage to do it , and the proven record that he Ted Cruz .   The criminal who murdered my son , Apolinar Altamirano , is a    member of the Mexican Mafia and claims to have ties to the Sinaloa Drug Cartel . He a   member of the Mexican Mafia to this country illegally and was first arrested in August 2012 for brutally kidnapping and sexually assaulting a young woman . Despite the violence , Altamirano was sentenced to just two years of probation under a plea agreement . He Altamirano turned over to the federal government . And under the " priorities " of the Obama Administration , they —   unbelievably —   released this    felon into our streets on a $ 10 , 000 bond to wait for a deportation hearing , a hearing that never happened . Meanwhile , as he Altamirano the streets for two years after his Altamirano , two orders of protection were filed against him Altamirano including one by a woman who said she feared for her she . The federal government apparently knew about the two orders of protection yet they let Altamirano The federal government free . Because the Obama Administration was willing to ignore all of this , Altamirano was free Altamirano murder my son . This lawlessness is not an exception —   it ’s the This lawlessness rule . In 2013 , the Obama Administration the Obama Administration Obama Administration , 000 criminal illegal aliens .     thousand criminals who had come here illegally had committed additional crimes , including murder and rape had been in government custody and then had been released . A single one caused the death of my son . I shudder to my son pain and harm thousands more such criminal have brought , and will bring , to other American families . *    *    * My son Grant was 21 years old my son at a Mesa convenience store called QuikTrip my son Just before 4:00 a. m. on January 22 , 2015 , Altamirano walked in , spilled change on the counter and demanded a pack of cigarettes . As Grant began counting the money , the man put a gun to his head shouting my son You ’re not gon na my son my money , " and " You ’re not gon the money me my cigarettes . " Grant quickly handed over the cigarettes , but this    Grant shot him anyway , my cigarettes point blank . Grant was my son only my son my son He was a Grant , a nephew , a grandson . His only my son brought joy to everyone he met . He loved exploring only my son desert near our home on only my son    and only my son on the Denver Broncos during football season . only my son would have turned 23 this March . But he Grant never celebrate another birthday —   because of Grant evil murderer who was let loose by a complicit federal government . The federal government could have saved my son by simply enforcing the a complicit federal government it let a criminal illegal alien who had been convicted of a felony go a complicit federal government to wait for a deportation hearing that never came . Even worse : the     directive came to the U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) from our Commander in Chief . A Commander in Chief who seems to put the comfort of criminals over the lives and safety of our children . *    *    * This election season , we ’re being promised a lot of things by a lot of candidates . our most important question for fathers like me —   for every parent who cares about the safety of our children —   is who will keep his word ? Who has the record , and the courage , and the political will to finally secure the border , end     policies , and stop illegal immigration ? Ted Cruz is the only candidate whose actions match his words , who has a record to prove that he will secure the Ted Cruz , deport criminal illegal aliens , and end illegal Ted Cruz . Donald Trump talks a good game , but talk is cheap . Donald Trump employs illegal immigrants . What ’s more , his vow to deport Donald Trump people is just another plan for " touchback " Donald Trump , where illegal aliens are sent home but can then turn right around , hop back into the country , and become a citizen . That ’s not real deportation —   it seems more like the practices that led to a    felon deportee being allowed to murder another one of our children , Kate Steinle . Kate was killed on the San Francisco pier just a few months after Grant ’s death . Marco Rubio had his chance to secure the border . When he ran for the Senate , he Marco Rubio his constituents in Florida that he would Marco Rubio it —   the way Marco Rubio ’s Marco Rubio the same to the Marco Rubio people now . But when he had Marco Rubio chance , he joined Obama and the Democrats in siding with illegal Marco Rubio . his chance to secure the border n’t Marco Rubio to secure the border first , to stop     or to Marco Rubio sanctuary cities . That ’s no surprise , given that he has supported amnesty as far back as 1998 . He ’s repeatedly broken his Marco Rubio to Americans we can not and should not trust Marco Rubio to keep us Marco Rubio . Ted Cruz led the fight against the     Gang Marco Rubio Eight    bill we He is the only candidate who has promised —   on his First Day as President Ted Cruz   to end Obama ’s executive amnesty . Rubio says Ted Cruz same thing in English , but admitted during a Spanish interview that he wo n’t immediately undo Obama ’s executive amnesty . Ted Cruz introduced Kate ’s law Rubio ensure that criminals like Obama one who killed my son are locked up and , once deported , can never come back to the United States . He also sponsored legislation to end sanctuary cities and stop     policies . Most recently , my son Cruz and Jeff Sessions introduced legislation to make sure that ICE officials have the funding Ted Cruz to enforce the law and protect us from illegal immigration . Since 2013 , when ICE officials defeated the     Gang of Eight bill , Cruz has been fighting to secure the border Ted Cruz and he is the only one with a Ted Cruz immigration plan that tells us exactly what he ’ll Ted Cruz as President . So we know what Ted Cruz will do when he gets Ted Cruz the White House : he will us the law Ted Cruz the border , and Ted Cruz violent    criminals away from our Ted Cruz and daughters the law will do what the border Administration has refused to do , and what no us candidate has Ted Cruz willing to do : prioritize the safety of Americans above the comfort of illegal immigrants . I can not bring my son back , but I can support Ted Cruz for President so that no parent has to go through the grief that my family and Ted Cruz endure . So that our suffering will not be in vain . We will do our part to nominate a candidate who will restore the rule of law and protect our safety and our . Steve our is an Arizonan whose son , Grant Ronnebeck , was killed in January 2015 our an illegal immigrant .
