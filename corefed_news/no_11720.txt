On Saturday , Apostle Wayne T. Jackson of Great Faith Ministries , a black church in Detroit , wrapped Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in a Jewish tallit , or prayer shawl , brought straight from the Holy Land of Israel for the purpose . [ If there were ever an image that could confound the false caricature of Trump as a    antisemitic demagogue , that would be it .   Which is precisely why Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s    detractors are seething . The Times of Israel , covering the reaction on social media presented " both sides " of the issue : "   …     [ W]hile some mocked the image of a Protestant presidential candidate receiving a Jewish tallit from a Christian pastor , others saw the incident as pandering to both Jewish and    voters . " Over at Tablet magazine , an online publication devoted lately to the    analogy , the hitherto    Yair Rosenberg seemed to have trouble digesting Trump in a tallit , offering a short and corny listicle full of    ending with the wishful thought that "   Twitter " might be having just as hard a time accepting the idea of    Trump . The day before   Trump , Yair Rosenberg had published an article arguing that because     types would be gratified by a Trump win ,   Trump voting for Trump would be   Trump for " the mainstreaming of    and    bigotry into the American government and the country ’s political discourse . " Why that illogic applies to Trump , and   Trump to Hillary Clinton , given the many antisemites in the Black Lives Matter and " Palestine solidarity " movements who would be gratified by her victory , Hillary Clinton did not explain . Indeed , the most salient case of outright antisemitism in the 2016 presidential campaign has been the effort by senior Democratic National Committee officials to use Bernie Sanders ’s religion   —    or lack thereof   —    against him for Clinton Rosenberg benefit . And for all the " " phantoms that NeverTrump and the Clinton campaign the 2016 presidential campaign Clinton    tyranny of political correctness is a real and concrete thing , closely aligned with the    fanatics who are bringing elite antisemitism back into vogue on American campuses and elsewhere . Notably , Trump ’s poll numbers have improved as the Clinton campaign has escalated the 2016 presidential campaign Clinton Perhaps there are the 2016 presidential campaign Americans who are sick of the Thought Police , and willing to oppose four ( eight ? ) more years of the same .
