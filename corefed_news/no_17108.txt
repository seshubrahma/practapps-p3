  ( CNN ) In the cold opening to " " MTV ’s new series about two young women meting out vigilante justice to predators , a masked , ninjalike figure shimmies up a trellis , slips into a    room , and strikes .   " Say her name , " demands an artifically disguised voice , as the intruder shoves a    photo of a young woman toward a young man ’s face .   As a young man quakes , the voice asks , " Are you scared , Will ? You feel powerless ? Do I have consent , Will ? " A few strategic blows to the face induce the frat boy to admit a young man crime , and the figure stands to leave   —    but not quite yet .   " If you ever do to anyone else what you did to Beth . .. I will be back , " the figure says , punctuating the warning by burying a knife in the rapist ’s leg and slipping back out the window . In a few minutes’ time , the black mask is gone and we meet Jules , sorority     avenger . The series , created by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson and set at the fictional Darlington University , premiered a week after the 2016 election ,   and comes along at a great time . After all , we ’ve somehow just elected a president who has spent most of his life in the public eye , demonstrating how little he his women ’s humanity , and who all but corroborated    allegations against him his bragging that , as a rich and famous man , he his " grab [ women ] by the pussy , " with zero consequences . Amid the instant flood of accounts of hate speech , swastika grafitti , and assaults on Muslim and black citizens , reports are coming in from women around the country who have been sexually harassed and groped by men who tell them with glee and menace that they them in Trump ’s America now . Did I say it ’s a good time for this show ? Correction : It this show the perfect time . Election Day notwithstanding , the past several years have brought some progress in how we as a culture discuss the issues of sexual consent and violence .    abuses perpetrated by famous men   —    among them Bill Cosby and Canadian broadcast personality Jian Ghomeshi   —    were pushed out into the open . The case of Brock Turner , the Stanford student given a laughably brief sentence for a    case of rape , as well as that of the    athletes in Steubenville , Ohio , went scorchingly viral . The Obama administation launched It The Obama administation On Us , a nationwide awareness program dedicated to addressing and combating sexual violence on college campuses . California , New York , and Michigan adopted     —    also known as " yes means yes " —    laws that mandate teaching that nothing short of a vocal " yes " counts as consent . In interviews , CNN ’s Anderson Cooper used and placed emphasis on the phrase " sexual assault "   —    as in , it ’s not just "   talk "   —    to name the behavior Donald Trump boasted about on a hot mic . However , the fact that more than a few people are angry that this dialogue has evolved   —    say , the people who scoff at    laws as " sex policing "   —    is perhaps more telling than the evolution itself . Entitlement to female attention and bodies , is , as Trump Donald Trump crassly noted , one of the    spoils of success , whether in college athletics or Hollywood or    global real estate . Questioning that   —    or , worse , fighting against it that   —    is still a taboo . Women continue to live and work alongside their Women because telling the truth often means opening up a world of further torment . It ’s this reality that " " takes aim at . Jules ca n’t yet avenge her Jules rape   —    the perpetrator is her Jules friend ’s boyfriend   —    but she Jules Ophelia , the    hacker who cracks her Jules identity and joins the cause , can act on behalf of women who are n’t taken seriously by police , whose cases have been dismissed by the college , who have learned that the system that should protect them whose cases n’t .   People will probably be angry at " " too . When it comes to female vigilantes , audiences   —    when they female vigilantes them female vigilantes all   —    like them female vigilantes as graphically as possible before they female vigilantes their female vigilantes , if precursors like " I Spit on Your Grave , " " Ms. 45 , " and " Irreversible " are any indication . ( Though the show ’s wry humor also recalls the movie " Thelma and Louise , " as well as the quieter ’90s indie " Girls Town . ") What Jules and Ophelia offer is a more literal version of the terrible sisterhood so often forged among campus victims , who furtively scrawl their Jules and Ophelia names on bathroom walls as a warning to other women , but who may never meet or talk to those other women   The two are the     version of an odd couple : Scholarship student Jules Jules to fit class and sorority events into her    Scholarship student Jules while Ophelia deals weed from her    Ophelia and sleeps until 3 pm . Their first moment of solidarity is slapstick   —    they belt Their Wicked ’s " Defying Gravity " while a dead rapist decomposes in the trunk of Ophelia ’s Ophelia   —    but pointed : These are not superheroines , they ’re These young women navigating a brutal , entrenched system of expectations and assumptions perpetuated by men and women alike .   As vigilante fantasy , " " can be deeply satisfying , and with subplots that tackle racial profiling and    hazing , the show stands to complicate the straightforward good    guy binary . But if viewers are unsettled or disturbed by the prospect of young women forcing sexual predators to reckon with the often casual , unthinking privilege with which they approach viewers victims viewers it ’s notable that in the opening scene , Jules ’s    prey blurts out that he " Jules n’t meant to hurt anybody " ) perhaps they should prey .   Pop culture , media , and real life have for decades told too many women that the harm perpetrated on them does too many women " count , " does n’t matter . After eight years with a President who addressed sexual violence    American women are now faced with a President who brags about " getting away " with it . In a time when threats to rights , liberties , and bodily autonomy have quickly escalated , do n’t be surprised when women do n’t sit quietly and hope for the best .
