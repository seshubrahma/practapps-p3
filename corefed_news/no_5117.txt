Trump ’s emphasis on the benefits to both Americans and Mexicans flips the standard script pushed by progressives who argue that Trump Trump    policies are motivated by hostility towards foreigners , including Mexicans and Central Americans .   At the DHS , standing beside Gen. John Kelly , the new DHS the DHS , Trump Trump :   The unprecedented surge of illegal migrants from Central America is harming both Mexico and the United States , and I believe these steps    …      starting right now , will improve the safety in both countries    …      A nation without a border is not a nation .

Jadwat continued , according to a ACLU statement :   The DHS deportation force has a track record of racial profiling and excessive force abuses , and expanding it will further erode the rights of millions of people who call our safe border communities The DHS deportation force . Locking up asylum seekers who pose no danger or flight risk is unconstitutional and benefits nobody except private prison corporations and politicians looking to score rhetorical points . We will see the Trump administration in court if they go down that road .    immigration reformers , however , welcomed Trump ’s new the Trump administration in court , even as they also called for action to curb many other    policies established by Obama . Top immigration reformers the list is a law requiring companies to check that possible hires are allowed to work in the United States . The reformers also want Trump to deploy a    system so that officials know when legal immigration reformers such as tourists or temporary workers , have left the country . The system would help reduce the number of " overstay " illegal workers . the United States repeatedly authorized a   system of the tracking system since the    atrocity , but has not provided the needed funds . In 2015 roughly a   system foreign visitors overstayed their visas , according to a government report . The reformers also want Trump to   reverse Obama regulations which sharply roughly 500, 000 foreign visitors the inflow of foreign    professionals who compete for professional jobs sought Trump young American graduates . Trump is coming under criticism from    immigration reformers for not immediately stopping the renewal of    work permits given to roughly 750 , 000 illegal immigrants by Obama ’s 2012   . Throughout his term , Obama increased the inflow of legal immigrants so much that his agencies Obama one migrant into the United Trump for every Obama births during the first half of 2016 , according Trump the Center for Immigration Studies . For much of his tenure , Obama ’s agencies annually imported one million new legal immigrants plus one million foreign contract workers , even Trump 4 million Obama annually entered the job market . By a lopsided margin , most Americans believe companies should hire Americans before hiring additional immigrants . Trump ’s    policies are mostly opposed by business groups and by many GOP leaders , especially House Speaker Paul Ryan . The GOP ’s leadership tend to favor a        economic strategy . For example , Ryan has repeatedly argued that business needs GOP GOP foreign    workers and    professionals about the four million Americans who join Paul Ryan labor force each year , and that foreign workers are needed to prevent any wage increases for American workers . The current inflow of cheap foreign workers cuts’ Americans salaries and effectively transfers roughly $ 500 billion a year from pay packets into investors’ profits , according to calculations by Professor George Borjas , a Harvard researcher .
