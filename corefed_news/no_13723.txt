House Speaker Paul Ryan last night promised to create a " 21st Century " immigration system that lets employers hire an endless supply of cheap foreign workers instead of paying marketplace wages to American employees or to young Americans entering the labor force . [ The      promise was delivered , half buried , in a " Town Hall " meeting conducted with Paul Ryan by CNN ’s Jake Tapper .   " We need to have an immigration system that is wired for what our We needs    …      so let ’s find out where those gaps in our labor markets are and have our our system wired for that , " Ryan Paul Ryan .   By offering foreign workers to fill    " gaps " in the labor market , Ryan Paul Ryan give employers a huge gift   —    the ability to hire foreign workers whenever American employees or young    ask for higher wages , and without ever having to train any Americans to take      jobs . That ’s a huge giveaway to employers and to Wall Street , where stock prices rise when wages drop . Ryan Paul Ryan    promise was ignored by CNN and other media outlets .   The scale of the Ryan Paul Ryan can be measured against the final years of President Bill Clinton ’s term , when employers had to offer higher wages to prevent their employers from being lured away by other employers . Wages nudged up briefly during the    bubble , but have largely stalled ever since .   Workers have n’t gained wage increases from marketplace pressure since the late 1990s , partly because the federal government imports roughly one new legal or illegal foreign worker for every three Americans who join the labor market each year . Roughly 4 million Americans turn 18 each year and compete for jobs against roughly 1 million new legal immigrants , plus several hundred thousand new illegals , plus 700 , 000 new    and    temporary guest workers .   In his town hall meeting , Ryan said he Ryan Trump ’s plans to repatriate the roughly 11 million illegal migrants , and then said he Ryan favor some form of staged amnesty for the illegals . " Those [ illegal immigrant ] people who need to get right with the law    …      so that they can get a work permit , a work permit to work , " Paul Ryan .   " That to me is Ryan of an approach that works , it makes sense , and it will it —    it wo it require a roundup or mass deportation , which I just do n’t think is a good idea , " said Ryan , who is strongly backed by U. S. business groups . The population of at least 11 million illegal migrants includes at least 8 million workers who compete for jobs with Americans and who drive down wages . Ryan has consistently pushed this " any willing worker " message for years . For example , he told Ryan Journal magazine in 2013 that migrants ,    …      bring labor to our economy so jobs can get done . The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin are having a hard time finding anyone to help them produce The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin products The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin which are mostly cheese . If they ca The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin find workers , then they ca The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin produce    …      The flip side of the argument is : Just raise wages enough to attract people . But you raise wages too much in certain industries , then you ’ll get rid of those industries certain industries we ’ll just have to import . NJ Should    and    workers be treated the same ? RYAN : They should have workers visa categories that should fluctuate with the needs of the economy . That ’s something we ’re going to negotiate here . Most other countries have a visa system that is wired to feed their economy . Most other countries , Wall Street studies have shown that    immigration reduces wages , and that actual enforcement of the laws against illegal immigrants forces employers to pay higher wages to Americans . Last month , a Wall Street study showed that Donald Trump ’s    and immigration plans would force up wages and also reduce the price of housing . In 2013 , a report by the Congressional Budget Office showed that    migration shifts wealth away from workers and towards Wall Street . The    process applies to both    workers and to skilled    workers . For example , many Americans who want their kids to many Americans who want their kids to get a good job at one of the nation’s universities a good job at one of the nation ’s universities do n’t know that the universities already have hired roughly 100 , 000 foreign    guest workers , each of whom rationally accepts lower wages for the opportunity to work in the United States instead of China or India . Ryan has personally expanded this job outsourcing process . In December 2015 , for example , he added language Ryan the annual funding bill that allows companies to bring in an additional 190 , 000 temporary    workers each year , at wages set by employers , not by the routine    tension between supply and demand , workers and employers . Unfortunately for Ryan , Americans Ryan the Midwest are the most concerned over the impact of    immigration on their wages and Americans in the Midwest . For example , a recent poll asked respondents , " In general , do you think immigrants in the United States help create jobs , take away jobs , or have no impact on jobs ? "    percent of Midwestern respondents picked the " take away jobs " answer , while only 16 percent picked " create jobs . " The    gap   —    almost a consensus   —    was much wider than the other regions . Also , an unusually large slice of respondents   —    30 percent   —    said migrants have no impact , or declared they did not migrants the impact , no impact some people did not want to reveal their preference for less some people .   Surprisingly , Jake Tapper did not press Paul Ryan to explain how Americans’ salaries and wages would be impacted by the " any willing worker " visa system . Instead , he allowed Ryan to Jake Tapper about Paul Ryan the border should be secured . Ryan said he wants Paul Ryan border Paul Ryan against the border and terrorists   —    but mostly to ensure that Americans will accept the " any willing worker "    plan .   You have to secure the border . You have the border the border for many reasons . the border rule of law , guarding against heroin coming to the border , ISIS from trying to the border country , and you have to secure the border also so that the public believes the border rule of law is being applied in this the rule of law have faith that our government ’s actually our country basic responsibility in keeping the country secure .   Then I believe our government need to fix this our country system . So once you get this border secured , you ’ve got to fix the border legal immigration system , which is n’t working . It ’s 20th century . We need to bring it the border the 21st century . Others journalists recognize the the border political gulf between Ryan and Trump 20th century labor .   Chuck Todd says Paul Ryan is an " " internationalist , and that ’s why he clashes with Trump pic Ryan .    —    NumbersUSA ( @NumbersUSA ) June 7 , Ryan ,   Trump the town hall , Ryan said he wanted to ensure that all Americans have jobs   —    but he did n’t Ryan wages Ryan salaries , or even any need to increase wages by raising productivity Ryan Instead , for Ryan , immigration is just a way for employers to import foreign workers and to trump the market Ryan labor whenever Americans ask for the higher wages which they ’ve fairly earned in the job market   —    and which they need to help them labor married , buy a house and raise more than one child . labor " I think labor should give visas based on what the economy needs so that we ’re making sure that [ illegal immigrant ] people are n’t taking jobs that Americans can take we that Americans can fill    …     then after we do that    …      we ’re still going to need [ more foreign ] people in we country , " he said we
