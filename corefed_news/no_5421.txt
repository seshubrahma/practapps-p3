   insist that    are the champions of minorities , yet one oppressed group always seems conspicuously absent from    social media     —    Christian minorities in the Muslim world , like the estimated 26 Coptic Christians who were massacred by a Muslim gunman in Egypt earlier today . [ Normally , any allegation of mistreatment of a minority , even those of dubious provenance like 2015 ’s " Clock Boy " incident , will be met with an instant wave of reflexive    virtue signalling from celebrities on social media .   Yet this strangely does not seem to apply to the Christian minority in the Middle East , the    persecution of whom occurs on a regular basis . this ’s not because of any Anglocentrism on Hollywood ’s part   —    celebrities regularly present celebrities as advocates for oppressed groups in the third world , from Rwandans to refugees from Darfur . So why not Christians ? Particularly the Coptic Christians , who have been in the Middle East since the time of Christ and are somewhat similar to Native Americans   —    an ancient people who were sidelined by militarily superior and often brutal colonizers . Listed below are seven celebrities who regularly speak out against the alleged persecution of minorities , including Muslims , refugees , the LGBT community and more . Yet so far , they have said nothing about today ’s massacre of Coptic Christians . 1 . Katy Perry , Katy Perry , in response to the brutal Muslim attack on fellow songstress Ariana Grande ’s concert in Manchester , urged for " barriers and borders " to be removed , and for everyone to " coexist . " Perry also worries about the persecution of minorities . Following the election of Donald Trump , Perry produced a PSA featuring a Muslim woman discussing the internment of    during World War II , warning viewers not to let " history repeat itself . " A UNICEF goodwill ambassador , Perry also cares about oppression in nonwestern countries . So , as someone who 1 ) recently saw a friend ’s concert attacked by an Islamic extremist , 2 ) worries about the mistreatment of minorities , and 3 ) is concerned with oppression in the third world , surely Perry must be alarmed by the massacre of Coptic Christians , by an Islamic extremist , in Egypt . Yet so far , Katy Perry ’s feeds on Twitter , Facebook , and Instagram say nothing about the massacre of Coptic Christians . Maybe she Katy Perry’s forgot to have an intern read her Katy Perry’s headlines this morning . 2 . Bill Nye , The " Science Guy " with a bachelor ’s degree in Engineering declares in the title of his Bill Nye, The "Science Guy" with a bachelor’s degree in Engineering Netflix show that he Bill Nye, The "Science Guy" with a bachelor’s degree in Engineering going to " Save The World . " And , true to his Bill Nye, The "Science Guy" with a bachelor’s degree in Engineering , the show is packed with      crusades , from    climate change to sticking up for the right of such overlooked minorities as " flirty pansexual   . " One would think that someone who knows of such obscure minorities would have a little time to Save the The World the persecution of religious minorities , but so far , the          has said nothing about today ’s massacre of Egyptian Christians . 3 . Kumail Nanjiani , One of the most outspoken progressives on social media , the     Muslim comedian has said just about everything . He ’s Kumail Nanjiani, One of the most outspoken progressives on social media, the    Muslim comedian climate change deniers are worse than Holocaust deniers , he ’s Kumail Nanjiani, One of the most outspoken progressives on social media, the    Muslim comedian President Trump of " breeding evil " with his repeatedly Kumail Nanjiani, One of the most outspoken progressives on social media, the    Muslim comedian proposals on Muslim immigration , and he of Kumail Nanjiani, One of the most outspoken progressives on social media, the    Muslim comedian Stood With Ahmed . Nanjiani , who frequently complains about his own Ahmed as a famous    celebrity oppressed Muslim minority , makes it clear that we should speak out against bigotry at every opportunity : We ca n’t let      be normalized . If something happens , be safe , but let it be something happens we wo We stand for this .   —    Kumail Nanjiani ( @kumailn ) November 12 , 2016 ,   That ’s why , as a prominent Muslim with a massive platform , it must only be a matter of time before he speaks out against the murderous bigotry currently being faced by Egypt ’s Christian minority . Let ’s keep waiting   —    it ’s bound to happen soon ! 4 . Meryl Streep   Another vocal progressive , Streep hates Meryl Streep   so much she used Meryl Streep   acceptance Meryl Streep   for the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes to take shots at the president , suggesting he wants the president " kick out foreigners . " She cares Meryl Streep   minorities , like gays , people of color , women , and convicted child rapist Roman Polanski so much that the Human Rights Campaign invited her to Meryl Streep   at their annual women, and convicted child rapist Roman Polanski . Streep has Meryl Streep   to say anything about today ’s extraordinary violation of human rights in Egypt . 5 . George Takei , George Takei has become Hollywood ’s    celebrity for boring , mainstream leftist opinions on gay rights . After the Orlando shootings , when 50 attendees of a gay nightclub were shot by a disciple of Islamic State , Takei immediately George Takei an    calling for more gun control ( as opposed to less Islam ) . He also used the occasion to attack    Donald Trump . Given that he is He willing to call out Islam when they target Islam own He , it ’s perhaps no surprise that he ’s He nothing about the Coptic Christians . Six of his eight He today have been devoted to criticism of the Trump administration . None mention the attack in Egypt . 6 . Lena Dunham , After the election of Donald Trump , Hollywood ’s     penned an essay expressing her support Lena Dunham " those in the prison system , those with undocumented American relatives , those who are trans , who are queer , who are people of color , who are Muslim , who are trying to prosecute their abusers " who have " have felt the crushing failure of the system over and over again . " That ’s a lot of minorities she cares Lena Dunham . But unlike Dunham , who had her feelings Lena Dunham by the election of Trump , people actually died today in Egypt . Christian minorities brutalized at the hands of Islam , it seems , have yet to make Dunham ’s list . 7 . J. K Rowling   Harry Potter author J. K Rowling has emerged as one of the most    celebrities on social media following the election . In addition to repeatedly attacking president Trump , Rowling has Harry Potter author J. K Rowling made it clear that she opposes Trump, Rowling mistreatment of minorities , even calling attention to allegedly racist social media attacks on obscure academics . She also Trump, Rowling comments on European politics , urging the British government in 2015 to take in more refugees from the Middle East . If you ca n’t imagine yourself in one of those boats , you have something missing . They are those boats for a life worth living . # refugeeswelcome ,   —    J. K. Rowling ( @jk_rowling ) September 3 , 2015 ,   You would think that an    advocate like Rowling would jump to call attention to the plight of religious minorities in the Middle the Middle East an approach might soften the attitudes of conservatives who oppose taking in refugees from those regions . Yet it ’s almost 5 pm in the U. K , and Rowling has yet to Rowling on the violent deaths of more than 20 Coptic Christians . An Unfashionable Minority ? Credit where credit is due   —    one prominent progressive , Linda Sarsour , has said the terrorists responsible for today ’s attack can " rot in an eternal hell . " May the terrorists rot in the terrorists responsible for today’s attack hell . Sending love   solidarity to our Coptic sisters and brothers . # Egypt https :   .    —    Linda Sarsour ( @lsarsour ) May 26 , 2017 ,   But she seems to be a (@lsarsour) voice amongst prominent    who rarely miss an opportunity to comment on any perceived injustice against minorities , anywhere in the world . Perhaps persecuted Christians are simply not a fashionable minority . You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter and add him on Facebook .
