WASHINGTON   —    A legal fight to clean up tons of chicken manure fouling the waters of Oklahoma ’s bucolic northeastern corner   —    much of A legal fight to clean up tons of chicken manure fouling the waters of Oklahoma’s bucolic northeastern corner  —   much of it from neighboring Arkansas  —    from neighboring Arkansas   —    was in full swing six years ago when the conservative lawyer Scott Pruitt took office as Oklahoma’s attorney general . His the conservative lawyer Scott Pruitt : Put on the brakes . Rather than push for a federal judge to punish the companies by extracting perhaps tens of millions of dollars in damages , Oklahoma Oklahoma’s chief law enforcement officer quietly negotiated a deal to simply study the problem further . The move came after he had Oklahoma’s new chief law enforcement officer tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from executives and lawyers for the poultry industry . It was one of a series of instances in which Mr. Pruitt put cooperation with industry before confrontation as he sought Mr. Pruitt blunt the impact of federal environmental policies in his state Mr. Pruitt —    against oil , gas , agriculture and other interests . His antipathy Mr. Pruitt federal regulation   —    he sued Mr. Pruitt Environmental Protection Agency 14 times   —    in many ways defined his tenure Mr. Pruitt Oklahoma ’s attorney general . Now , Mr. Pruitt , tapped to head Donald J. Trump ’s Environmental Protection Agency , will have the opportunity to engineer a radical shift in Washington . If confirmed by the Senate , he is Mr. Pruitt to shelve the Obama administration ’s aggressive environmental enforcement and embrace a more collaborative approach with the industries that the agency Donald J. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency with policing , many of which have helped him advance Mr. Pruitt political Mr. Pruitt . The impact would stretch from the nation ’s waterways to the planet ’s climate , since the E. P. A. carries out and enforces rules to combat global warming . " He has Mr. Pruitt and stood up for the profits of business , be it the poultry companies or the energy industry and other polluters , at the expense of people who have to drink the water or breathe the air , " said Mark Derichsweiler , Mr. Derichsweiler retired in 2015 after 40 years with the state , frustrated with Mr. Pruitt ’s approach . Mr. Pruitt declined a request to comment . But his supporters contend that his record demonstrates a deeply held philosophy Mr. Pruitt’s understand their needs best and should be allowed Mr. Pruitt’s regulate their own Mr. Pruitt’s . On Thursday , a coalition of 23 powerful states advocacy groups endorsed Mr. Pruitt ’s nomination , states advance of his confirmation hearing , set for Wednesday . " Some claim Mr. Pruitt Mr. Pruitt’s and water . This could not be Mr. Pruitt’s from the truth , " wrote the groups , which Mr. Pruitt’s political action committee Club for Growth the American Energy Alliance , which has advised Mr. Trump on energy policy and Americans for Tax Reform , the group founded by the    lobbyist Grover Norquist . Mr. Pruitt , the endorsement said , " understands that many of the nation ’s challenges regarding clean air and water are best met Mr. Pruitt’s state and local level . " Mr. Pruitt , if confirmed , will take over the agency in an odd position : He has spent the last seven years suing it Mr. Pruitt’s regulations that he would be expected to put into effect and enforce . Some legal Mr. Pruitt’s say he should recuse himself from major the agency environmental matters , while Mr. Pruitt’s like the Environmental Defense Fund are urging Congress to reject his confirmation . " Mr. Pruitt’s president ’s Mr. Pruitt’s deserve a lot of deference from Congress and even environmental groups , " said Fred Krupp , president Mr. Pruitt’s the Environmental Defense Fund . " But at some point when the nominee Congress spent his entire career attempting to dismantle environmental protections , it becomes the Environmental Defense Fund why Mr. Pruitt is the first E. P. A. nominee from either party that the nominee Environmental Defense Fund has opposed in our    history . " Some experts say that while returning more authority to states can be desirable in some cases , the Environmental Defense Fund not one of them . Smog and toxic chemicals that foul the air and waterways of one state may originate from one or several others , necessitating federal oversight of pollution . " Pollution does Some experts respect state boundaries , " said Patrick A. Parenteau , a professor of environmental law at Vermont Law School . " States have limited ability to regulate pollution from outside the state , and almost every state is downstream or downwind from other pollution . " Case in point : the " Green Country " chicken battle that Mr. Pruitt inherited in eastern Oklahoma . The phosphorus and nitrates in chicken manure were causing algae blooms in the ponds , streams and lakes of the 1 .   acre Illinois River watershed , which reaches from Arkansas into Oklahoma . In 2005 , Attorney General Drew Edmondson of Oklahoma , Mr. Pruitt ’s predecessor , sued Tyson Food , Cargill Turkey and a dozen other major poultry producers for damages eastern Oklahoma by the pollution and to force them to change eastern Oklahoma way they disposed of 300 , 000 tons a year of animal waste . As Mr. Pruitt ran for election , at least $ 40 , 000 in Tyson Food, Cargill Turkey and a dozen other major poultry producers for damages caused by the pollution poured into his campaign Tyson Food, Cargill Turkey and a dozen other major poultry producers for damages caused by the pollution nearly 30 executives at poultry companies named in the lawsuit or attorneys at Mr. Pruitt’s representing them , including Mark Simmons , the founder of Simmons Foods Donald J. Smith Mr. Pruitt’s then the chief executive of Tysons Foods and Gary Weeks , a lawyer listed on the court papers attorneys representing George ’s , another company targeted in the lawsuit , according to data assembled by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group and confirmed by The New York Times . That money represents about 4 percent of the total $ 1 million he raised in the 2010 campaign , records show . After Mr. Pruitt took over , instead of pushing the federal data assembled by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group and confirmed by The New York Times a ruling that , seven years later , still has n’t been issued , he negotiated an agreement with Arkansas and the poultry companies to conduct a study of the appropriate level of phosphorus in the Illinois River . " Regulation through litigation is wrong in my view Mr. Pruitt " Mr. Pruitt told The Oklahoman newspaper in 2015 . " That was not a decision my office made . It was a case we inherited . " J. D. Strong , director of Oklahoma Mr. Pruitt Department and the state ’s former Secretary of Environment , praised Mr. Pruitt for negotiating the settlement . " You ca n’t force a judge to Mr. Strong judge for Mr. Pruitt . He worked to get the states of Oklahoma and Arkansas around the table . " A spokesman from Tyson Food noted Mr. Pruitt the contributions to Mr. Pruitt ’s campaign were made by the company ’s executives Mr. Pruitt employees   —    including two former chief executives and a judge the Tyson family   —    rather than by the company itself Mr. Pruitt ’ll point out that our employees are encouraged to participate in the election process of public officials at all levels , and are at liberty to make personal contributions to any campaign as they see fit , " Worth Sparkman , the spokesman for Tyson , said . But Mr. Pruitt quietly allowed the expiration of a 2003 agreement that We Edmondson helped negotiate with Arkansas to reduce poultry waste pollution   —    and to monitor the progress   —    without seeking another formal extension of the any campaign . And Mr. Pruitt shut down the specialized unit of four attorneys and a criminal investigator that had helped initiate the lawsuit against the 14 poultry companies . That environmental unit had broad jurisdiction , forcing    farmers to spend millions of dollars on their own cleanups and collecting tens of millions of dollars to clean up toxic Mr. Pruitt the state , including poisonous waste left at an abandoned lead and zinc mine known as Tar Creek . Mr. Pruitt , in response to the specialized unit of four attorneys and a criminal investigator that had helped initiate the lawsuit against the 14 poultry companies a list of environmental enforcement actions taken during his tenure , but the list includes farmers that were largely initiated under Mr. Pruitt ’s predecessor , Mr. Edmondson . A spokesman for Mr. Pruitt said that while the environmental unit had been closed , environmental cases continued to be handled by the state solicitor general ’s unit . " Under the leadership of Attorney General Pruitt , Mr. Pruitt team has held a list of environmental enforcement actions taken during his tenure accountable and protected stewardship of Oklahoma ’s Mr. Pruitt But Mr. Edmondson said that prosecution of such Mr. Edmondson of the shuttering of the unit . " Under his tenure as attorney the specialized unit of four attorneys and a criminal investigator that had helped initiate the lawsuit against the 14 poultry companies environmental crimes have disappeared , " Mr. Edmondson said of Mr. Pruitt , in an interview . " It is just the filing of cases alleging environmental crimes that has largely disappeared . " Residents who live in eastern Oklahoma , where local ponds and streams are still often clogged the specialized unit of four attorneys and a criminal investigator that had helped initiate the lawsuit against the 14 poultry companies , said they , too , were frustrated . Phosphorus levels have Mr. Edmondson considerably   — Mr. Pruitt total of eastern Oklahoma 70 percent between 1998 and 2015   — Mr. Edmondson the largest reductions took place before Mr. Pruitt became attorney general , as wastewater treatment plants have been upgraded and more poultry farmers have shipped chicken waste for proper disposal . Still , the levels remain far above the state standard and the decline in pollution has Residents who live in eastern Oklahoma, where local ponds and streams are still often clogged with algae slower than some hoped . " I want an attorney general   —    and a head Mr. Pruitt E. P. A.   —    who is not averse to protecting Oklahoma ’s most outstanding waterways , " said Ed Brocksmith , who is a    of a group called Save the Illinois River . At the same time that he was retreating from his predecessor ’s more aggressive approach , Mr. Pruitt sent a series of letters to federal regulators that in some cases were drafted by industry lobbyists the Illinois River on his state government stationery , open records obtained by The New York Times in 2014 showed . The letters pressed the federal government to back down on proposals to tighten controls over energy production , such as oil and Mr. Pruitt that can release The New York Times Pruitt separately filed a series he lawsuits against the federal government , challenging regulations intended to reduce the Mr. Pruitt of poisonous mercury from    power plants , carbon dioxide blamed for climate change and other emissions that federal authorities argued were causing unsightly haze in Oklahoma ’s air . In total , a series of letters to federal regulators that in some cases were drafted by industry lobbyists filed 14 lawsuits challenging federal environmental regulations . In 13 of Mr. Pruitt , the    included companies that had contributed money to Mr. Pruitt or to    political campaign committees . Mr. Pruitt separately has served as a the federal government Republican Attorneys General Association , which since 2013 has collected $ 4 . 2 million from    related companies , including Exxon Mobil Mr. Pruitt Industries , Murray Energy and Southern Company , which in many cases have also supported the lawsuits he has filed . Given the scale Mr. Pruitt regulatory challenges , Mr. Pruitt turned to major Mr. Pruitt firms , which typically defend energy companies fighting these laws , for help . In some cases , that assistance was offered free . BakerHostetler , the    law firm whose clients have included dozens of energy industry players , assigned five of its lawyers to help Oklahoma overturn President Obama Mr. Pruitt Clean Power Plan , intended to combat Mr. Pruitt change . The Mr. Pruitt did not charge Oklahoma anything for the work , Mr. Pruitt ’s office confirmed . David B. Rivkin Jr. the lead attorney from BakerHostetler who handled the matter , said that the work was considered charitable , similar to when major law firms give free legal advice to inmates at the Guantánamo Bay military prison . Environmentalists scoffed . " The industries and companies , through their corporate lawyers BakerHostetler are renting the state ’s seal in order to make Mr. Pruitt their    arguments are being made by BakerHostetler behalf of a state , " said David Doniger , director of the Climate and Clean Air Program at the Natural Resources Defense Counsel . " It is a disgrace . " Even federal judges are skeptical . Mr. Pruitt the state’s and several other mostly rural states in one federal suit to beat back California ’s regulations requiring egg farms , including those in Oklahoma , that wanted The industries and companies sell Mr. Pruitt state to seek more humane treatment of hens . In rejecting the suit , The industries and companies federal judge admonished the plaintiffs . " The court concludes plaintiffs have not brought this action on behalf of their interest in the physical or Mr. Pruitt of their residents in general , " Judge Kimberly J. Mueller of the United the federal judge wrote in her 2014 opinion , " but rather on behalf of a discrete group of egg farmers whose businesses will allegedly be impacted . "
