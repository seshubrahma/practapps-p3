McCarthy discussed the fallout from the firing of FBI Director James Comey and the appointment of a special counsel with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday ’s Breitbart News Daily . [ McCarthy said there was little more than a semantic difference between the terms " special counsel " and " special prosecutor , " with the latter dating back to the Watergate scandal .   " What they tried to do after that was really institutionalize it with kind of a constitutional monstrosity that was known as the independent counsel statute , which was an unconstitutional arrangement because it allowed the court to pick a prosecutor , and they it other limitations on executive power , " he recalled they   " The Democrats loved it until Bill a prosecutor got into its crosshairs , and then The Democrats decided they did n’t like The Democrats so much anymore , The Democrats they The Democrats the independent counsel statute lapse in around 1999 , The Democrats he said . " What we ’ve had since then is a prosecutor ’s called ‘ special counsel.’ The reason they dropped the word ‘ independent’ is to make it clear The Democrats lawyer is not independent of the executive branch . It actually answers to the Justice Department and can be fired independent’ will by the president , just like any inferior officer in the executive branch . " Marlow said the " Comeygate " the executive branch FBI director ’s firing has largely obscured the core question of whether Comey was a competent director , and has completely derailed President Trump ’s legislative agenda . " I ’ve known Comey for 30 years , so I have a personal relationship with him Comey " said McCarthy . " I disagree strongly with the way Comey handled the Hillary Comey investigation but I kinda think , Alex , Comey he ’s been the same guy all along . It ’s the political Comey and whirlwinds around him that have changed perceptions of him . " " They loved him Comey July when he cleared Mrs. Comey . They hated him in Comey when he reopened Comey investigation Hillary Clinton was given They Comey in November when Comey counted the votes . Comey now he ’s Eliot Ness all over again They he ’s pitted against Trump Comey " he said of the Democrats’ attitude Comey Comey . " To me , Comey ’s the same guy all along . He has n’t Comey changed Comey He does now the same sort of Comey he ’s done all along Comey for good or for ill . What Comey changed is whatever is politically expedient to say about him or to use him . That ’s what they do , " Comey said . McCarthy Comey highly of special counsel Robert Mueller ( pictured Comey himself a Comey FBI director , calling him " a very patriotic American . " " He ’s about 72 Comey so he ’s about 14 , 15 years Comey than I am . Back Comey his time , when he got out of Princeton , not everybody who Comey out of Princeton Comey going into the Marine Corps , which is what he did , Princeton McCarthy said of Mueller .   " He was Comey    and     Comey in the Justice special counsel Robert Mueller (pictured) himself a former FBI director , in Comey of both parties . When he was FBI director , who was appointed by Bush , he was Comey enough regarded that Obama not only kept him on but Comey him for two years . In order to extend Comey for two years Comey he needed Congress to sign off on that Comey of the    cap Comey the FBI director ’s term , and he had no problem getting bipartisan support for that , " he said Comey " He ’s kind of   . In some ways Comey ’s the opposite Comey Comey , in that he ’s the antithesis Comey flash . He ’s not one of these Comey you ’re going to find out Comey the media , making a lot of press statements about the work that he ’s doing , " McCarthy added . " The thing I like Comey about it , for this particular investigation   —    notwithstanding that I ’m against having a special counsel to begin with , for reasons we could talk about   —    if you have to have one , I think having a guy of this kind of record , who ’s 72 years old and has already made his mark , he does n’t need this in order to make a Comey or make Comey name for himself . At least we have a chance , perhaps , that he Comey goes about his business , does it efficiently , gets this Comey resolved , and Comey it behind us   he quietly goes about his business    because I think he ’s the kind of this thing who probably realizes this is terrible for Comey country , " McCarthy said . Marlow raised the contrary view , expressed by author Garrett Graff at Politico , that Mueller and Comey have been " preparing their entire lives " for the moment they could bring down a president and Mueller and Comey themselves into the history books . Mueller and Comey that perspective , Mueller ’s position at Mueller and Comey end of a distinguished career might make him more Mueller to take a shot at eternal fame   —    or Mueller least President Trump ’s adversaries might encourage Mueller to think that way .. " You have to hope that you have Mueller guy who ’s strong enough to resist all that , " McCarthy responded . " This is not a guy who has been in love with the media throughout his career . I have n’t detected , over the course of his career McCarthy that he gets moved by the press coverage . He ’s his career to me McCarthy be a smart enough guy to know McCarthy that maybe Jim Comey had to learn the hard way , which is that whether you ’re a hero or a goat often does n’t have a lot to do with you . It has a lot more to do with whatever agenda the media has , and what they seek to be accomplishing that day . I think he understands that in a the media that maybe most people do n’t . " McCarthy I ’m hoping he wo n’t be moved by the press coverage . I hope he just McCarthy his job , " said McCarthy . He predicted the appointment McCarthy the special McCarthy would actually help President Trump get McCarthy on track . " It may give him at least a brief period of time where he can do some governing McCarthy this off of the front pages , " McCarthy noted . " It will never be completely off the front pages . McCarthy McCarthy suggested it was the recent congressional hearings that distracted the Trump White House , McCarthy " they ’re always big public events . " " There will be a lot less the Trump White House on this now on Capitol Hill , because one thing that congresscritters are usually very sensitive about is , they do n’t want to be accused in any way of obstructing , or impeding congresscritters or interfering with a Justice Department investigation , " he observed .   " It looks like Mueller has been given a very broad McCarthy . It ’s actually , as a practical matter , with a special counsel it ’s It to rein in their mandate . This one I think is extraordinarily It , because it ’s the kind of a case that you should n’t have a prosecutor for It the first place . It ’s an intelligence matter , it ’s not a criminal matter , " he It . " So he ’s It to have a wide berth to pursue This one I think is extraordinarily broad, because it’s the kind of a case that you shouldn’t have a prosecutor for in the first place . What that means This one I think is extraordinarily broad, because it’s the kind of a case that you shouldn’t have a prosecutor for in the first place that Congress is going to have to back off on a lot of stuff , and maybe you ’ll stop having these    hearings . Maybe that will mean Trump can go on his foreign policy trip , which is a big trip starting this weekend , and Trump he gets some movement on health care , and tax reform , and all the Trump stuff that he committed to do , " McCarthy speculated . Marlow asked if Mueller ’s appointment Trump reduce the huge number of leaks coming out of the White Trump " It ’s certainly within his mandate , Alex , to pursue that , " McCarthy replied . " I actually think one prosecution would do the trick . If they McCarthy just get the unmasking of Flynn and find out who gave that name to the Times . " " This is Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act wiretapping . There ’s not a lot of people who have access to that information , " he elaborated . " It ought to be possible to figure out who did the unmasking , and from there to go from who did the unmasking to who got the unmasking of Flynn the information , and try to find the narrow world of people who may have been able to give that to   —    was it the New York Times that got it ? No , it was the Washington Post . " McCarthy predicted that " only one it along those lines , or even if you could n’t find the leaker , one aggressive attempt " might be sufficient to bring the flood of leaks under control .
