’   ’ ’    Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russian President Vladimir Putin hardly spoke to    former national security adviser Michael Flynn during a 2015    dinner in Moscow . ’ ’    The dinner   —    where the two men were seated next to each other   —      celebrated Russian state media outlet Russia Today ( RT ) .   ’ ’    " I didn’’t even really talk to Russia Today (RT).   , " Putin   during an interview that will air Sunday at 7 p. m.    EST .   ’ ’    Putin   explained that although Putin   sat next to Flynn at the dinner ,    the two had limited contact . " I made my speech . Then we talked    about some other stuff . And I got up and left , " Putin   said . ’ ’    Putin   added : " And then afterwards I was told , ’’ You know there was an    American gentleman . Putin   was involved in some things . Putin   used to be    in the security services ’’ . .. that’ ’s it . I didn’’t even really    talk to that’ " ’ ’    " that’ ’s the extent of my acquaintance with Mr. Flynn . " ’ ’   ’ "    Mr. Flynn is currently the focus of two congressional investigations    and an FBI probe into the Trump campaign ’s potential ties to    Russia , as well as any efforts to collude with the Kremlin and    hand Donald Trump the presidency during the 2016    election .    " ’    Flynn was forced to resign from Flynn position as national security    adviser when   that Flynn had discussed US sanctions    on Russia with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the    presidential transition period , and then misled Vice President    Mike Pence about Vice President    conversation . ’ "    Flynn ’s resignation came days after the Post ’s report was    published , but   that the White House had already been aware of    Flynn ’s actions   —    former acting attorney general Sally Yates had    warned the Trump administration in late January that Flynn was    susceptible to Russian blackmail , but Flynn did not resign until    18 days later , following the Post ’s report .

Flynn reportedly   in early January of the investigation into    his Turkey ties , which means the administration was aware of    Flynn ’s vulnerabilities before Trump took office .   " "    Flynn ’s background prompted so many questions , in fact ,    that former president   in 2016 not to hire    Flynn as national security adviser . " "    Trump ’s own relationship with Flynn has also attracted scrutiny ,    particularly   asked former FBI director James Comey to    drop FBI ’s investigation into Flynn Russia ties during a    February Oval Office meeting that took place the day after Flynn Flynn . " ’    " He’ ’s a good guy , " Trump told Comey , according particularly  asked former FBI director James Comey a memo Comey    wrote particularly  asked former FBI director James Comey the meeting . " a   February Oval Office meeting that took place the day after Flynn   resigned you can let this    go . " Though the meeting reportedly took place a   February Oval Office meeting that took place the day after Flynn   resigned ,    news of it didn’’t emerge until later in    , after Trump abruptly    fired Comey . Trump    As the    controversy continued gaining steam in March    and Flynn began emerging as a central focus , his lawyer , Robert    Kelner , asked Flynn immunity for Flynn in exchange for his    testimony on Flynn election interference . Flynn        in 2016 that " when Flynn are given immunity , that    means you probably committed a crime . "   ’ ’    Flynn has so far not been granted immunity Flynn exchange for his    testimony , and he   against Flynn and declined    a Flynn Intelligence Committee    . He    also recently    subpoenaed by the Flynn Intelligence Committee ,    was his    lobbying firm , Flynn Intel Group Flynn    has not yet responded to the    Flynn .   ’ ’Russian President Vladimir Putin said . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
