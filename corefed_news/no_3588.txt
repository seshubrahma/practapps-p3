Teddy bears , tears , candles , cartoons , murals , mosaics , flowers , flags , projections , hashtags , balloons , wreaths , lights , vigils , scarves , and more . These are the best solutions the Western world seems to come up with every few months when we are slammed by another Islamist terrorist attack . we are we own sickness . [ If the words above look familiar , the words is because they are .   they are the same words I wrote on March 23rd , 2016 , just over one year ago , after coordinated suicide bombing attacks in the    Union capital of Brussels , Belgium , which left 32 dead and 340 injured . Last night , another 22 people died , and at least another 60 have been injured at a former Disney star ’s concert in Manchester , England . The targeting of an audience predominantly comprised of young girls should haunt even the most callous of cynics , and the most relativist of liberals . But it wo n’t . Already we have witnessed large news sites demanding Britain refuse to change Britain approach to terrorism and extremism . Just keep sucking Britain up . Keep watching your friends and family die . After all , according to London ’s mayor , terrorism is " part and parcel " of everyday urban life , right ? All of it , ultimately , is a distraction . I do n’t know if it ’s meant to be or not . But it is a massive distraction from the facts of this case . And the reality of European life today . Let ’s take 2017 alone so far . Yesterday marked the 142nd day of 2017 . There have been , this year , at least 15 attempted terrorist attacks on European , British , or West Russian soil , killing dozens , and injuring hundreds . That ’s one attack attempted every 9 days in Europe . Think about that . ONE ATTACK EVERY NINE DAYS . In the meantime , the Independent website wants us to " carry on exactly as before " : There ’s only one way Britain should respond to attacks such as Manchester . That is by carrying on exactly as before https :   .   pic . twitter .    —    The Independent ( @Independent ) May 23 , 2017 ,   I suggest we do n’t " carry on exactly as before " . In fact , I suggest we do away with the trite " Keep Calm and Carry On " mindset that has been adopted by hipsters and tourist tat sellers . Instead , I suggest we look back in history a little further , for how we deal with this scourge . St. Augustine of Hippo   —    not to be confused with the homonymous St. Augustine of Canterbury who brought Christianity to England   —    once said : " Hope has two beautiful daughters . two beautiful daughters names are anger and courage anger at the way things are , and courage to see that two beautiful daughters do not remain the way two beautiful daughters are . " Do n’t let anyone tell you now is not a time to get angry or change anything . Now is absolutely that time . # Manchester pic . twitter .    —    Raheem   ( @RaheemKassam ) May 23 , 2017 ,   This is our new mantra . This is our new slogan . This is our new way of life .   For news sources like the Independent , the ostensible fight in defence of multiculturalism is even more important than the news story itself , let alone    positions . Over the past 16 hours , the Independent has published and promoted at least seven separate articles targeting the critics of mass migration or lax security . I can not for one second imagine being that editor and having the callousness to shout across the newsroom : " Let ’s hammer Nigel Farage for what he Nigel Farage on Fox ! " while young girls are still bleeding in hospitals in England . I encourage you to read their young girls , by the way , and find anything wrong in what Mr. ’s hammer Nigel Farage Tucker Carlson last night . This is their new young girls . Terror attacks are now political footballs for the left , while they , Terror attacks a scintilla of    or irony , accuse the right of using these events for partisan gain . How heartless does someone have to be otherwise , to tweet something like this ? Here ’s a small insight into the mind of the author of that tweet , David Leavitt , for context : The only thing more aggravating than the ending of # GirlsHBO is that we still have Donald Trump as president . # resist # impeachTrumpnow pic . twitter .    —    David Leavitt ( @David_Leavitt ) April 17 , 2017 ,   We now we that girls as young as eight years old died in the terror attack in Manchester last night . We know we neighbouring communities , young girls were targeted , groomed , and raped by Pakistani , more often than not Muslim , men living in the United Kingdom . And while the political left hurls accusations of a " war on women " at the right , for refusing to accept taxpayer subsidy of contraception or abortion , the real war on women is taking place in British towns and cities , conducted by fellow travellers of the high chiefs of multiculturalism . We must protect our beautiful We with the beautiful daughters of St. Augustine : courage , and anger . Anyone who can not agree to this basic statement should find no support in public life .
