Former Virginia chairman of the Donald Trump for President campaign and candidate for Virginia governor Corey Stewart spoke to Breitbart News Monday as voters prepare to go to the polls in Tuesday ’s GOP primary . [ Virginia governor Corey Stewart has campaigned as an    Trumpian populist , placing the fight against illegal immigration at the center of his policy portfolio and rousing the ire of the mainstream media and the political left with his steadfast defense of Virginia ’s numerous monuments to Virginia Confederate war heroes .   " I led the nation ’s toughest crackdown on illegal immigration in 2007 . It ’s still in place today . So far we have handed over to the federal government more than 7 , 500 criminal illegal aliens , " Stewart told Breitbart News , referring to Stewart time as a Prince William County Supervisor where Stewart first came to national notice for Stewart introduction of a county policy requiring police to look into the immigration status of those police arrest . Stewart continued Stewart pitch for serious immigration enforcement , focusing on the transnational criminal gangs that have been terrorizing Virginia , committing a string of gruesome crimes evocative of the transnational criminal gangs that have been terrorizing Virginia central American origins across Virginia . Stewart said : I am determined to put in place the toughest statewide crackdown on illegal aliens in the country in Virginia , especially rooting out and destroying   . I am going to do that through the 287 ( g ) authority , which would mandate that every locality , every jail in the Virginia check immigration status    …      and hand inmates over to the federal government if they ’re the federal government illegally . Stewart sought to draw a contrast between Stewart own immigration agenda and that of Stewart main opponent in the GOP primary , putative    and narrowly defeated 2014 U. S. Senate Candidate Ed Gillespie , whom Stewart called a " squish Republican " despite Stewart own pledges to be tough on immigration . Stewart has hit Gillespie for serving as a lobbyist for Tyson ’s Food as it was charged , and later acquitted , in a human smuggling investigation in connection with its labor it . Tyson ’s Tyson’s use of refugee and    immigrant labor has continued to come under criticism from    immigration groups . " Ed was paid money not only to downplay human smuggling charges , but also to lobby for amnesty , " Stewart told Breitbart News . " That ’s not being tough on illegal immigration , that ’s being complicit in illegal immigration . " " He never Tyson’s on his statement Tyson’s he supports Tyson’s " Gang of Eight " amnesty , " Stewart continued Stewart referencing Gillespie ’s    endorsement of a " path to citizenship " on CNBC ’s Larry Kudlow . " The Amnesty for twelve million illegals , he called Tyson’s good politics and good policy . " Gillespie also Gillespie Kudlow in CNBC’s Larry Kudlow 2013 interview that the Gang of Eight bill was " not perfect . " His campaign Tyson’s insists he was Tyson’s supportive of the bill ’s amnesty provisions . Gillespie campaign Gillespie David Abrhams took issue with Gillespie ’s Gillespie his immigration record Gillespie campaign spokesman David Abrhams " We ’re done commenting on Corey ’s constant stream of attacks , fabrications and falsehoods . Ed ’s focused on the issues that matter to the voters of Virginia , and we ’re looking forward to tomorrow ’s primary , " he told Breitbart Ed . While Stewart ’s hardline immigration stances have caused sparks between him and his Ed primary Ed Gillespie and State Senator Frank Wagner , it is the controversy surrounding his defense of Ed ’s Confederate heritage that pushed his campaign into Ed pages of the national press . The issue exploded this spring , as cities like New Orleans began to tear down    monuments built to the southern heroes of the War Between the States to the applause of " civil rights " groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center and their allies in both major political parties . In Virginia   —    cradle of the Confederate capital birthplace of such    revered generals as Robert E. Lee , J. E. B. Stuart , and Thomas " Stonewall " Jackson host to almost all of the    conflict ’s most    battlefields and source of more Confederate war dead than any state   —    the march to erase the   " ugly " Confederate past ran into an obstacle . In Charlottesville , home to University of Virginia , which a little over 150 years ago provided the Confederate Army with more than 1 , 400 officers including slavery opponent and pioneer of mobile warfare John Mosby , the city council ’s efforts to remove    statutes of Lee and Jackson were met with lawsuits and defiant protests . Stewart , alone among prominent politicians , stood , much to the chagrin of the mainstream media , with those who sought to preserve the reverent memory of the Confederate dead of the Old Dominion . Outlets like Politico and the Washington Post quickly published dismissive pieces on Stewart linking him Stewart racial Stewart when he refused to Stewart the monuments and those who defended them . Stewart racial hatred likely Stewart November ’s general election should he win Tuesday ’s Stewart , Democratic    Tom Perriello , made a stand with the leftist agitators and liberal local governments calling for the widespread removal of historic Confederate monuments across the state , accusing Stewart of " touting Stewart ignorant ,    view of Virginia " with his insistence they be Stewart alone and calling the Confederacy " our greatest sin . " Perriello later tweeted that Stewart was " a Stewart apologist trying to use racism to score political points , " as he used the incident Stewart hit his    general election Stewart Gillespie , who had said he would vote for Stewart if he won Stewart primary Stewart of him . Not even Stewart Confederate apologist trying to Confederate racism to score political points can draw condemnation from @EdWGillespie . Says it all . https :   .    —    Tom Perriello ( @tomperriello ) April 25 , 2017 ,   " What I ’ve found is that those liberal like Tom Perriello who preach tolerence are some of the most intolerant people there are . He is intolerent and Tom Perriello who preach tolerence a hatred and disgust of Virginia ’s heritage and history , " Stewart said to the implication : Anyone trying to destroy [ the monuments ] is trying to rewrite and erase our history for their own ends . Anyone trying to destroy [the monuments] ’m trying to defend it and for that he calls me a Tom Perriello who preach tolerence and a racist and   . I ’m not trying to ’m in the past    …      but that does n’t mean we let go of our culture and of we values , and we n’t mean that we denigrate those men we fought to protect Virginia . Asked what he thought Perriello ’s Tom Perriello who preach tolerence view of Virginia was , in Virginia to the " ignorant ,   " once ascribed to him , Stewart replied Tom Perriello who preach tolerence Tom Perriello ’s vision Perriello is transgender bathrooms Virginia every rest stop , every school , and every business , millions of illegal aliens coming into Virginia taking people ’s Virginia , committing crimes and then not having them deported . His vision crimes having Tom Perriello who preach tolerence ’s vision for Virginia regulations on Virginia businesses and continued Virginia losses . His vision is the Tom Perriello who preach tolerence of ’s vision for Virginia industry in southwestern Virginia . His vision Virginia misery Tom Perriello who preach tolerence poverty . ’s vision for Virginia campaign declined to comment for this article .
