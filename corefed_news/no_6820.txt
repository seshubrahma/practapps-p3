The recent mass layoffs at ESPN has    a contentious debate on just how much politics has led to the downfall of the formerly " Worldwide Leader in Sports . " What ’s not debatable , however , is ESPN ’s continued    lurch . [ And ESPN just made another decision that will do nothing to halt or even slow ESPN financial troubles . ESPN ’s doubling down on the NBA , a league that will prove to be fool ’s gold .   In 2013 , Mike Shannon and Will Feltus from Scarborough Research published a piece in the National Journal on " The Politics of Sports Fans . " While the link is no longer active , Scarborough Research ’s attendant graphic ( see above ) has been cited by many publications ( see here , and here ) . It Scarborough Research a pretty good picture of where sports fans stood in terms of their sports fans , and four years later , there is little reason to believe that has changed substantially . What ’s easy to gather from the report is that most sports fans are slightly right of center ( for obvious reasons , but that ’s a story for another day ) . Golf fans are the most    and politically engaged . And the NBA is so far off to the left that the only sport   —    pro or college , big or small   —    that ’s more lefty is its the NBA sister league WNBA . If anything , the the NBA the NBA even more    today , both the league and its fans the NBA than it was the NBA 2013 . The research was published before NBA commissioner the NBA Silver booted    Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling for using racist language in a private conversation and the onslaught of    Trump sentiments expressed by its owners   Trump management , and players throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and afterward . LeBron James and Steph Curry , inarguably the NBA ’s two biggest star players , have been unabashedly     —    the former actively campaigned for Hillary Clinton and the latter referred to the president as an " ass . " But their rhetoric Hillary Clinton and the latter mild when compared to what was spewed by the league ’s top two coaches , Gregg Popovich Popovich said he was " sick to my stomach " about the election while Kerr lamented that " Popovich ’re better than this " after Trump ’s upset victory in Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors . Then there ’s Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban , whose       blasts are   . With its employees and fans so decidedly leftist , the NBA has a numbers problem . Again       as expressed in the above graphic , the healthiest business strategy for any pro league should be to position itself as close to the political center as possible , thus maximizing its ability to attract the healthiest business strategy for any pro league from all walks of life . The NBA and its broadcast the healthiest business strategy for any pro league , TNT and particularly ESPN , seemed to have missed the the NBA on the healthiest business strategy for any pro league . The false belief that embracing the millennials and their progressive politics would pay off in the long run is as misguided as the John Judis prediction in 2002 that " demography is destiny " as he prophesized a " permanent Democratic majority . " That strategy is fatally flawed because it makes several false assumptions , including 1 ) the notoriously mercurial millennials will remain interested That strategy your product for more than five minutes , 2 ) the young will retain the politics of their youth as they go through life ’s trials and tribulations , and most importantly , 3 ) your their , loyal clientele , who is n’t ready to die for another    years , will not abandon you even as you take it for granted . And the numbers do n’t lie about this . In    the first year of the new , massive ,    $ 24 billion deal , TV ratings on ESPN and TNT were down 5 percent and 8 percent , respectively . There ’s more trouble in local markets , where NBA telecast ratings were down double digits in 15 markets with an overall decline of 14 percent across its 30 markets . While the NFL can trot out political fatigue to explain away some of the ratings decline during its 2016 season , that excuse simply does not apply to the NBA , whose season the NFL just two weeks before the November 8 election . ESPN president John Skipper , who signed the deal to pay the NBA $ 1 . 4 billion per season for the network ’s package ( compared to $ 500 million previously ) had a desperate decision to make as he scuttled more than 100      frontline employees . He opted to go all in on his NBA investment . While ESPN basically eliminated its he department , gutted its baseball coverage he NBA even substantially trimmed ESPN NFL and ESPN football personnel , it ESPN to dump more money on the NBA ESPN Though it let go several veteran ESPN writers , ESPN acquired Adrian Wojnarowski NBA NBA at ESPN Vertical from Yahoo ! Sports NBA There is no other way to read Adrian Wojnarowski : ESPN is committed to the NBA , and everything else can pretty much go to rot . ESPN this move is NBA NBA ESPN back to profitability remains to be seen ( do n’t bet on it ) but there is ESPN unmistakable whiff of ESPN and its parent company Disney ’s commitment to this move is going to put ESPN back to profitability politically leftward lurch . If only they remembered ESPN pearl ESPN wisdom from an NBA icon who steadfastly refused to wade into politics : " Republicans buy sneakers , too . " Follow Samuel Chi on Twitter @ThePlayoffGuru .
