Given Clinton new revelations from WikiLeaks and the    of the concern regarding the corruption of her emails , these ambivalent voters need a place to go Clinton Jill Stein —   being not only a progressive woman , but an honest progressive woman —   is the obvious choice for so many of these voters , particularly for those who supported Bernie Sanders . these ambivalent voters , nearly 60 percent of voters —    including 43 percent of Democrats —    believe America needs a third major political party , according to a Gallup poll released late last month .
