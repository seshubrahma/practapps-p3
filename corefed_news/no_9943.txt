" There is a consensus now that the Russians the Russians hack the the Democratic National Committee They the Russians to hack the Republican National Committee the Democratic National Committee . As for those John Podesta emails , it ’s inconclusive as to who hacked them . They can not prove that those John Podesta emails the Russians those John Podesta emails . But the one thing I can tell you is we ’ve been told by everyone privately , publicly that the CIA , nor do any of the intelligence agencies , have any information that the Russians the Russians trying to tip the election in Donald Trump ’s favor . The Director of the FBI has said what he believes is the Russians    the Russians just wanted The Director of the FBI undermine the Russians election , " King told host John Catsimatidis .

This is somebody in the CIA , or somebody CIA the intelligence community , or someone CIA House or the Senate who ’s taken some piece of information and are saying this . This is a lie , " he added .
