Cleveland ( CNN ) A push to move the GOP to the right on Israel scored a preliminary victory Monday in Cleveland . Delegates drafting the Republican National Convention platform approved removing language encouraging a    solution for Israelis and Palestinians . An earlier draft had included support for " two democratic states "     the policy of recent Republican and Democratic administrations     but had removed a reference to Palestine included in the GOP platform four years ago . On Monday , the national security subcommittee of the Platform Committee approved an amendment dropping support of a    solution , according to four people who were in the room for the discussion . Copies of the text are not distributed to the press , who are allowed to view proceedings . CNN obtained a copy of the earlier draft and received confirmation of the new language from multiple sources .   RELATED : Trump scores wins on GOP platform , " The U. S. seeks to assist in the establishment of comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East , to be negotiated among those living in the region , " the approved amendment said . " We oppose any measures intended to impose an agreement or to dictate borders or other terms , and call for the immediate termination of all U. S. funding of any entity that attempts to do so . " The move was a win for a group called the Iron Dome Alliance , which lobbied for the change . In further moves to distinguish the GOP from Democrats on Israel as the latter party moves further to the left on the issue , the Republican amendment also included new language defending Israel . RELATED : Groups seek to move the GOP to right on Israel , " We reject the false notion that Israel is an occupier , and specifically recognize that the Boycott , Divestment , and Sanctions Movement ( " BDS " ) is    in nature and seeks to destroy Israel , " the new version read . That seemed to be a direct shot at Democrats , who had to fight back a strong movement within their own party , represented by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , to call out " occupation " by Israel in the party platform .   The Monday language also went beyond the early draft , restoring the term " undivided "     dropped in 2012     to refer to Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . The full Platform Committee will consider the subcommittee â€™s version of the national security text on Tuesday , where delegates may offer more changes .
