Pat Caddell talked to Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Thursday about election developments . [ Pat Caddell said , " One of the things we ’ll see , and I ’ll predict this now and why if Trump ’s going to win Trump has to go to this higher ground , is , you ’re going to see    …      just how much the establishment order will fight to hold onto the establishment order power and privilege at all costs . "   Trump continued , " It is going to be the most    assault in every direction to try to keep [ Trump ] out of the White House . And so this is headed to Armageddon , if you will , politically . " " this is an election where the American people have bolted , " asserted Caddell , adding : the American people want control back of the American people government , and the American people are very    and political class . That ’s why you see such a united effort by the Democrats and Republicans in the establishment who are terrified that Trump represents the diminution of Trump power .
