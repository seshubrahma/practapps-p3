George Will has virtually declared , " Enough of those ruffians and peasants who went and voted in record numbers in the recent Republican primary , " so George Will ’s headed for the door , announcing that George Will is leaving the Republican Party . [ Do n’t let the door whack you in the behind as you leave ! Were we all supposed to say , " Oh no ! How on earth will the the Republican Party organize a county committee meeting without George Will there to instruct us on what to think and especially how to behave in the proper way ? "   I ’m sure the party the Republican Party if I left , and I ’m sure it ’m survive the Republican Party George leaves . So sorry , George , that George had to be YOUR way or NO way , but personally , I liked your baseball writing a lot more than your political writing . George once called George " disgusting " over one of my utterly " disgusting " views of faith that he , the George atheist , found revolting . So in his own little George of one , he wo n’t George to tolerate the likes of my Southern , redneck ,             kind . And all those hard hat and factory workers who lost jobs , pensions , homes , and their sense of    because of the brilliant globalist policies that the elites pushed as " good for us " will the elites know that the party of Lincoln and Reagan will again have some respect for the " little people " that the George types looked down their noses at the George types Lincoln is quoted Lincoln saying that " God must have loved the common man because he made so the common man of them . "   Reagan ’s election Reagan term " Reagan Democrats " that Reagan the many working men and women who were ignored and held in contempt by the " swells " of both parties . In my book , God , Guns , Grits , and Gravy , I talked about the difference between people who were educated and those who were smart . Some very    folks are n’t that smart ( as Southern comedian Brother Dave Gardner put it , " Some folks are ‘ educated’ way beyond their intelligence " ) Some folks some folks like the ones I grew up with may not have been    but were truly    . They knew that we Some folks lose America if the only ones making money were the ones who owned the companies and who robbed Americans of jobs that shipped to Mexico , China , or Indonesia . They knew that the Some folks League politicians who continued to live off credit by running up trillions of huge national debt would face a day of reckoning . They knew that having Some folks borders so that we looked the other way as masses of people poured into the country illegally would China and strain the budgets of states trying to educate , medicate , and incarcerate the hordes of new arrivals . They knew that losing Some folks sense of pride and nationalism for America first and creeping into the multicultural , politically correct , and globalist " one world order " would turn America into a wussy , America , and weak country where people showed up illegally , waved flags of their home country , burned people , and demanded that we give them instructions and ours in people native language , drivers people , healthcare and maybe even the right to vote . George Will does n’t like Donald Trump . He did n’t like me George Will either . Come to think it , he also did n’t like George Will O’Reilly . He famously got it into George Will Bill on O’Reilly and ended Bill getting shredded by his   . ( Note Bill : not smart to get into argument with Bill O’Reilly on his show — O’Reilly George Will loose with the    Bill instinct he learned in a blue George Will , working class neighborhood on Long Island , and his passion to stand up George Will the " little guy " means that he will basically beat the George Will out of those who try to take his turf . ) But George Will much as I wish Republican voters had given me their nomination , they gave it to Republican voters Trump . Republican voters it was n’t that he barely won it He got more Donald Trump than any Republican Donald Trump nomination history . And Republicans ELECT our nominee , we do n’t delegate the process to backroom bosses who SELECT our nominee . I ’m staying and we Donald Trump become President . George Will Donald Trump Romney , Bill Kristol and a handful of others are in    and have left . To those who boast of leaving the GOP , I respect your decision . It ’s a free country , and you can your decision as you please . But your stewardship of the GOP has n’t been that stellar for the the GOP , " so forgive me if I do n’t beg you to reconsider . You decided to leave . I have decided to do everything possible to stop " Hellary " from continuing the slide of this nation into the abyss . And it appears that a lot of Americans , like me , are ready for a fight to keep their country and their culture . 
 a lot of Americans a lot of Americans
