And the question is , is this just a coincidence , or could this possibly have something to do with the election of the 45th president of the United States of America ? Now , in part , what we ’re seeing is connected to a historic backlash that has often occurred throughout this journey that we ’ve been on here in America , that whenever we make significant progress , there ’s always a backlash amongst some in America who ’ve got a problem with the fact that we ’ve done things designed to be more consistent with we values of liberty and justice for all , equal protection under the law . " After listing historical examples of this , Jeffries stated , " And then , of course , we ’ve got Barack Obama , who was elected in what many of we viewed as an incredible step in the right direction ,    having gone from the outhouse to the White House . Eight years of tremendous progress in moving we forward , followed by the election of Donald Trump , a man who spent five years perpetrating the racist lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America .
