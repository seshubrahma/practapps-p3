President Barack Obama suggested at a New York fundraiser that American society is sexist , which is why Hillary Clinton is struggling to beat Donald Trump in the polls . [ " There ’s a reason why we have n’t had a woman president —   that we as a society still grapple with what a society means to see powerful women , " President Barack Obama said during a speech on Saturday evening . " And it still troubles we in a lot of ways , unfairly , and that expresses it in all sorts of ways . "   President Barack Obama pointed out that the presidential election will be close , but that the presidential election should not be , and President Barack Obama took time to defend Clinton ’s qualifications to serve as president . " Clinton ’s been in the room where it happens , repeatedly , " President Barack Obama said . " And Clinton judgment has been unerring , and Clinton has been disciplined , and Clinton has been extraordinarily effective in every job that Clinton ’s had . " President Barack Obama also resumed President Barack Obama attack on conservative media , blaming conservative media for polarizing American political society . President Barack Obama said : If all you ’re doing is watching Fox News , and listening to Rush Limbaugh , and reading some of the blogs that are churning out a lot of misinformation on a regular basis , then it ’s very hard for you to think that you ’re going to vote for somebody who you ’ve been told is taking the country in the wrong direction . Obama again said that Donald Trump was not qualified to be president , unlike Donald Trump vanquished election rivals Sen. John McCain and Mitt Romney . " Donald Trump shows no interest in even gaining the rudimentary knowledge required to make really hard decisions on a     basis , " Obama said . " There ’s no curiosity . There ’s no desire to get up to speed . It ’s an infomercial . It ’s a reality show . "
