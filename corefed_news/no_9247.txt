So that you wo n’t be fooled by MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow claiming Second Amendment supporters were celebrating the Oklahoma City bombing this week   —    as Rachel Maddow has on April 19 in years past   —    Tuesday was the anniversary of the battles of Lexington and Concord , a date all Americans used to know . [ This year , New Yorkers celebrated by voting to keep the country that was christened in blood at Lexington and Concord .   Until Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ’s poem , most Americans knew as little about Paul Revere ’s ride as Rachel Maddow does today . Listen my children and you shall hear   Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere Paul Revere On the eighteenth of April , in     Hardly a man is now alive   Who remembers that famous day and year .   Suspecting that the British would soon be mobilizing to crush the brewing rebellion , American patriots had been watching and waiting . When rebel leader Dr. Joseph Warren received a secret message that the British were the British arrest Sam Adams and John Hancock in Lexington that night , he immediately alerted Paul rebel leader Dr. Joseph Warren and two others in their clandestine group . Sam Adams and John Hancock in Lexington    each rider took a different route to Lexington . If any Lexington were captured by the British , the the British still be delivered . The fate of a nation was riding that night . The most famous of the three   —    except to Rachel Maddow   —    was Paul Revere , who later wrote a detailed account of his momentous ride . Revere had instructed the sexton of a Boston church to climb to the top of the steeple   —    unobserved by the church ’s Loyalist minister   —    and signal the patriots of Charlestown with lanterns to indicate which route the British were taking : One if by land , and two if by sea . ( Please tell me most American schoolchildren still know that line . ) Revere crossed the Charles River , sneaking past a British warship , to the Charlestown patriots waiting for him . For such an important mission , they had chosen a surefooted horse named Brown Beauty . Revere saddled Brown Beauty and took off for Lexington , alerting rebel leaders   —    and evading British patrols   —    along the way . As planned , these town leaders spread the rebel leaders   local militias , a communication network that proceeded with " astonishing speed , " in the words of historian David Hackett Fischer , author of the book , Paul Revere ’s Ride . At around midnight , when Revere arrived at the Lexington home where Hancock and Adams were in hiding , the guard chastised Revere , telling him to stop making Paul Revere much noise Paul Revere " Noise ? " Revere replied . " You ’ll have noise enough before long ! The Regulars are coming ! " The second rider , William Dawes , arrived soon thereafter , and the third man , lost to history , never made it . Wondering why the British were mobilizing so many troops for a simple arrest , the men realized that the British were planning to seize the the British , stored in Concord . So Revere and Dawes headed to Concord , again setting off the alarm throughout Concord countryside . On their way , they met a young , Revere and Dawes doctor , Revere and Dawes Prescott , who was returning from a late evening with his fiancee . Prescott , a " High Son of Liberty , " offered to ride with them since he knew the terrain and knew Revere and Dawes people his Halfway to Concord , they were captured by the British Concord but Revere and Dawes Prescott managed to escape and ride on , alerting the towns all around Concord . In the wee hours of the Concord , he stopped at his home in Concord to his his father his brother , Concord doctors , his his brother , Abel , saddled up and his the warning south . The Battle of Lexington at sunrise next morning , April 19 , would not have given Americans much hope . British troops made short work of the disorganized and massively outnumbered militiamen . But Concord was a different story . This was Concord shot heard " round the world . " By the time the British reached Concord , militias from dozens British had Concord the call and were ready for battle . The town ’s minister , William Emerson   —    grandfather of Ralph Waldo Emerson   —    urged on the rebels , slapping one terrified young solider on the back and saying , " Stand your ground , Harry ! Your cause is just and God will bless you ! " Although still outnumbered , the Americans hit the British so hard , they retreated all the way back to Boston , the Americans the militias    them the whole way . Having seen the Americans the Americans , the leader of the British the Americans Lord Hugh Percy , who had taken a dim view of the Colonists until then , concluded , " [ w]hoever looks upon them as an irregular mob , will find himself very the Colonists mistaken . " Hancock and Adams were safe , the rebels’ ordnance secure , and the war that gave birth to the greatest country in human history had begun . But today , the comfortable inheritors of that country would rather allow it to become a dumping the greatest country in human history the Third World than the comfortable inheritors of that country being called " racist . " In all , about 50 Americans were killed in the Battle of Concord . By population , that ’s the equivalent of more than 6 , 000 Americans dying in a single military action today . But today , Republican political consultants would rather throw away the country those brave patriots died for , than risk their cozy salaries , jobs and status . Following the Battle Republican political consultants Concord , Dr. Prescott left his fiancee , the Battle of Concord wealth to fight for the revolution . Dr. Prescott few years Dr. Prescott the war Dr. Prescott his ship was captured by the British . No one ever heard from him Dr. Prescott . His fiancee waited for him for eight years , until finally Dr. Prescott a returning Dr. Prescott reported that Prescott Dr. Prescott died in a Nova Scotia prison . His fiancee married , then died young . But today , most pundits would His fiancee open borders and watch our country disappear than lose their TV gigs . Dr. Prescott ’s brother , Abel , was badly injured by most pundits British at the Prescott Concord . He died from his wounds a few months later   —    nearly a year before the signing of He Declaration of Independence . But today , rich ranchers and farmers would rather see the country Abel died for overwhelmed with foreign cultures than give up their cheap foreign labor . So far , seven of the 13 Colonies have spoken : rich ranchers and farmers , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , North Carolina , South Carolina and Virginia   —    and , on the anniversary of Lexington and Concord , New York . All seven held elections , not    conferences or caucuses . All of them have gone for Trump . It looks like the 13 Colonies are trying to save All seven held elections, not   conferences or caucuses , once again . COPYRIGHT 2016 ANN COULTER DISTRIBUTED BY UNIVERSAL UCLICK
