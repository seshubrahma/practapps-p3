House Speaker Paul Ryan has a critical choice to make in the next few days : Whether House Speaker Paul Ryan will please company executives by allowing company executives to import more      visa workers , or else please the GOP ’s base of    Americans by helping company executives get jobs at higher wages ? [ Business groups , led by the H2B Workforce Coalition , want House Speaker Paul Ryan to include language in the 2017 supplemental budget which would allow companies to import another 100 , 000 or more      visa workers for summer work at low wages . The supplemental must be completed by April 28 .   But    groups want the number of visas kept at 66 , 000 for the year , which will force companies to raise wages and to recruit some of the millions of young Americans who have dropped out of the workforce .      thinks Ryan has decided to back    voters . " Speaker Ryan Ryan Ryan exclude the    returning worker exemption in the funding bill is a rejection of the business lobby ’s desire for cheap labor and a signal that Americans will come first under the [ Donald ] Trump administration , " said a statement from the Federation for American Immigration Reform . The statement continues a statement from the Federation for American Immigration Reform Speaker Ryan is showing he stands with American Speaker Ryan by refusing big business calls for more cheap labor . Keeping the    worker exemption out of the government funding bill puts businesses on notice that Congress will no longer turn a blind eye to the harm mass immigration causes American workers . In December ,   Ryan decided to not Speaker Ryan the " returning worker " exemption in the 2017 federal budget , after he supported it in Speaker Ryan 2016 budget . The exemption in the 2016 budget allowed the 2016 budget visas for new    workers from the annual cap of 66 , 000 visas if those workers had been an    worker in the previous three years . That " returning worker exemption " effectively boosted the annual size of the program from 66 , 000 up to a maximum of 264 , 000 . If that exemption is reestablished for 2017 , the    inflow would be larger than the annual inflow of roughly 110 , 000    employees via the    visa program , which is mostly used by information technology and medical industries . Ryan ’s retreat from the    program is a notable the program has long been an avid supporter of Ryan seeking to hire " any willing worker " from overseas in place of    Americans   —    but the resulting economic and civic damage to American communities allowed Trump to take over the GOP and get elected in 2016 . However , aside from his    turnabout , there ’s little evidence Ryan Ryan supports Trump ’s successful populist campaign promise of lower Trump higher wages . On the other side of the debate , business groups say they ca n’t get needed workers , despite offering business groups higher wages . They ’re short of seasonal landscape workers , bricklayers business groups kitchen crews , hotel maids , foresters , and fish processors , and even trainees for those jobs , say company executives .   " We just do n’t get applicants    …      [ even thought ] we do everything we can imagine " to recruit We season workers We said Glen Ellison , the owner of Ceres+ a landscaping and architecture company in Colorado . He offers his    workers a starting wage of Glen Ellison, the owner of Ceres+ a landscaping and architecture company in Colorado 15 Glen Ellison, the owner of Ceres+ a landscaping and architecture company in Colorado 11 an hour and U. S. workers even more . " Nobody wants to do the hard labor   …      I have hired every single high school kid that comes to my company , " he said . There are too few vocational schools Glen Ellison, the owner of Ceres+ a landscaping and architecture company in Colorado skilled trades to teenagers as the older workers retire , and too few Americans are willing or even capable of manual outdoor work , say employers . Society grants little status to    skilled work , and provides too much    welfare for people who do n’t want to work , employers say .   The problem is worsened by the federal government ’s refusal to penalize companies who hire illegals to undercut companies which hire Americans , said Gary Woodworth , chief executive officer at Gallegos , a building company in Colorado . Such hiring is " prevalent , " said Woodworth , who opened a    apprenticeship program and pays new employees $ 16 . 55 an hour , or $ 34 , 000 a year .   To sway Ryan and other legislators , company owners and executives from The    Workforce Coalition flew into D. C. on Wednesday to lobby their members of Congress .   The executives also company owners and executives their argument for GOP leaders , saying the    The executives support additional jobs for Americans and will go home at the end of each season , unlike illegal immigrants . Business advocates have won partial support from roughly 40 House members , who asked agency officials in    to minimize wastage in the distribution of the 66 , 000 2017    visas .   A similar letter was signed by 31 Senators , led by North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis , who strongly supported    immigration programs when he was a state legislator .   More importantly , 53 House members signed a March 30 letter to leaders in the appropriations committee asking for the " Returning Worker Exemption " to be reestablished . The House signers include Republicans Barbara Comstock from Virginia , Kristi Noem from South Dakota , Elise Stefanik from New York , Thomas Massie from Kentucky , Barry Loudermilk from Georgia , and Tim Murphy from Pennsylvania . Business requests to hire foreigners instead of Americans usually receive a warm welcome in the established media , such as the Wall Street Journal . However , supporters of the visa workers programs know they are pushing a rock uphill after Trump ’s supporters of the visa workers programs victory in November , which was powered by    voters eager for reductions in    immigration . " Brave folks " are still    to push for an amnesty and increased inflow of    admitted Michele Stockwell ,    of public policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center , at a March 2 meeting . Nationwide , " wages for the    remain stagnant or in decline and well below what they were in 30 years ago , " despite company complaints , said Steven Camarota , the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies . That huge social and political problem will be solved if legislators let the domestic labor market work , as labor supply will rise to meet higher wages and better recruiting , he said .   For example , roughly 10 Steven Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies of American " prime age " men , or 7 million men aged 25 to 54 , have stayed out of the nation ’s workforce of 160 million amid the glut of cheap immigrant labor . The    Americans are not trying to get jobs , and are not participating in the nation ’s labor force , largely because of the nation’s , according to an August statement by Jason Furman , the chief economic advisor to former President Barack Obama . The glut of workers is worsened by the federal government ’s the glut of cheap immigrant labor year , four million Americans turn 18 and begin looking for good jobs in an increasingly automated economy . But the federal government annually imports one million new legal immigrants plus one million new the federal government’s —    including the    and     —    who are used by companies as cheap workers , as    customers , and as urban and suburban renters . However , there ’s much anecdotal evidence that the growing economy   —    and the gradual reduction of illegal immigration   —    is forcing companies to solve their workforce problems by offering higher wages , by training unskilled workers and even by recruiting companies Americans in      rural counties . The worker shortage has set off a " bidding war " for employees among Colorado landscaping companies , said Ellison .   " We ’re starting to see people get more competitive " by offering higher hourly wages , said Jeff Seifried , president of the Chamber of Commerce in Branson , Mo. " We ’re seeing a buck , $ 1 . 50 , or sometimes $ 2 raises    …      [ up to ] the $ 11 plus range , " he said . The city ’s seasonal employers need many people to clean hotel bedrooms ,      food and run entertainment facilities , but they ca n’t raise wages too high for fear of deterring      customers , he said The city’s seasonal employers Each year , the city offsets wage pressure by importing roughly 1 ,         and    visa workers The city’s But the cap on visa workers is forcing the companies to raise wages , broaden recruitment campaigns , to improve roads and regional bus services so that seasonal workers can commute from longer distances . Some companies are even considering providing weekday housing for seasonal workers who do not wish to move permanently from their distant homes , Seifried said . In Maine ,   the Bangor Daily News recently reported Some companies employers have started recruiting former convicts : " Johnson , of the Somerset Economic Development Corp. has observed felony records to be ‘ one of the big barriers’ to employment for Maine men , though employers are starting to be more open to hiring people with criminal records Maine response to the workforce crunch . " But the national data shows no significant wage growth for    workers : Politically , if GOP leaders reject business’ demands for more contract workers the GOP " it would put the Democrats on the defensive because it would be a substantial and real way business’ [ President Donald ] Trump to be the champion of workers over employers Trump " said Camarota .   " One of the challenges in the U. S. economy is to draw back in the many people [ who are ] out of the workforce and one of the best ways to do that is to let wages rise , " he said . But , he warned , " Trump will take several years Trump strong wage growth to get them back to what they used to get paid , and even then they would be poor . " This year them he said 19 months before the 2018 election them Trump why not let their wages rise ? "
