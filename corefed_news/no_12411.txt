Sam Clovis ,    of Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign , reviewed Sunday night ’s second presidential debate on Monday morning ’s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow . [ " I thought we did really well , " said Sam Clovis . " I thought the first 15 minutes or so were pretty much as predicted , a little rocky , to be honest , but I think from that moment on , I do n’t think there ’s any question who was in charge , and I think charge really had Mrs. Clinton on the defensive for most of the rest of the debate . "   Sam Clovis disputed the notion that Mrs. Clinton came to the debate to " talk about the issues . " " Mrs. Clinton ’s done everything Mrs. Clinton can to avoid the the issues " charge said , " because Mrs. Clinton tax plan sucks . Mrs. Clinton record in foreign policy sucks . Mrs. Clinton has no love for the military . Mrs. Clinton ’s a criminal , and Mrs. Clinton ought to be in prison . I mean , I ’m just being blunt : this is a woman who ought to be in prison right now . If you or I had done what Mrs. Clinton has done , we would be in handcuffs in an orange suit , and we would we in a maximum security federal prison right now . " Clovis said it was Clovis absolute nonsense " to construe Trump ’s call for a special prosecutor during the debate as a banana    threat to jail his political opponent . " Director Comey has already come out and said she essentially Director Comey to the FBI , " he noted Director Comey " Martha Stewart Director Comey the FBI , the FBI went to Director Comey . If Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI , she the FBI be prosecuted Hillary Clinton And right now , what we have is , we have a deal struck we the Clinton campaign with the Obama Hillary Clinton , and I think if push comes to shove , I think Obama will pardon her before Obama thing gets Hillary Clinton of hand because if they think anything is going to reveal that she has committed more criminal Hillary Clinton than she already has , then Hillary Clinton think he ’ll pardon her . I really do Hillary Clinton I think this is in the works . And I do n’t think the American people are really fooled by this . " " What we ’re talking about is establishing the rule of law , and the rule of law applies the rule of law includes the former secretary of state , " Clovis declared . Marlow asked how the Trump campaign planned to strategize around the intense media focus on his " hot mic " lewd remarks , Trump considering that even the Republican Party is now destroying Donald Trump over these comments . " " Well , I think again it goes to the substance of what we have is , we have a vulnerability in the campaign , we Clovis replied , adding the Trump campaign This is Clovis vulnerability . Let ’s make no mistake . Let ’s be honest about this . We have a ’s here , comments that were made 11 years ago . They were recorded , and they ’ve come back comments that were made 11 years ago haunt the candidate . comments that were made 11 years ago candidate has apologized for those remarks . " the candidate think what it goes to is the fact that they do n’t want to focus on policy . comments that were made 11 years ago do n’t want to focus on the substance comments that were made 11 years ago the issues because the establishments of the Republican Party and the Democrat Party writ large are deeply threatened by a the Republican Party this country . " I really think this is why you see these      Republicans out here   —    I have other words , but I ca n’t use them on the radio   —    that go to the heart these     Republicans what I think is a despicable display of cowardice on the part of the Republican Party over this whole issue . " We do n’t the Republican Party the comments . I think the comments were bad , and frankly , if my son had said something the comments , I ’d have taken him back to the woodshed . I do n’t have any problems talking about that my son saying that because that ’s what I think of the comments . " The other side of it is , the comments are n’t the comments ’re after . What we ’re after is the substance the comments ’s going to lead this country . And that we what we ought to be focused on because the alternative of having Hillary Clinton as President of the we States is just too terrible to contemplate . " As for the Trump campaign ’s      game plan , Clovis said , " I think what you ’re gon na see is , we ’re gon na have comments , we ’re gon na come out and talk about these the United States , gon na go back on the United States campaign trail , gon na go back out and    the momentum we have talking about the issues , and that ’s what Mr. Trump is going to focus the United States . " He these issues would be " contrite , " and he would " stand up , and at Mr. Trump stop Mr. Trump ’s going to say , ‘ Hey Mr. Trump look , I made a mistake . I was Mr. Trump running for president 11 years ago , and what I said was wrong , and it ’s hurtful , and I feel bad about it . It was regrettable on my part.’ And a mistake , let ’s move on . " " Here ’s the deal : If the media are going to concentrate on these comments , I really think what we ’re looking at is the American people this will be a backlash , " Clovis predicted . " What we ’re really focused on here , right now , are the people who are gon na be weak on voting for Donald Trump anyway . And what they ’re trying to do is , the media are trying to solidify that vote , that they the people who are gonna be weak on voting for Donald Trump anyway take away or get the people the media or may not be committed to Donald Trump . the people who are gonna be weak on voting for Donald Trump anyway Trump voters are not gon na go away . They ’re gon na be there Donald Trump I think they ’re gon na be there in numbers that we Donald Trump voters n’t polled yet . " Clovis said he does Donald Trump voters know " what Speaker Ryan or the rest Donald Trump voters the party is up to Clovis " Clovis guessed there are " some concerns on the establishment side on    issues . " He disputed the idea that Trump ’s presidential campaign was faring poorly enough to make the Republican ’s hold Clovis the House tenuous : " My own experience in electoral politics is that this coattail thing is way overblown . People are going to go in and vote for the president . If they like their congressman or woman , they ’re going to vote for them . If they like their senator People they People going to vote for People . It does n’t matter People ’s at People top People the ticket People and all the other issues People are ongoing there . I just do n’t believe that that is as strong a phenomenon as a lot of other people would like to put out . " He went on to say , " What I do think is , there are a lot of people who are concerned about how the chess table will look , once the election is over , and whether or not you ’re going to have people that you can control inside the Republican caucus . If you have a majority   —    and I think we ’ll hold on to the House , I think the Senate , you know , it could be problematic . " " At the same time , " he asserted , " we see most the Senate the senators are running strong races , and it looks like we He going to hold the Senate in the the Republican caucus . So I think what a lot of this is we is what the chess the Senate going to look like when it ’s over , win or lose . If Trump wins , that covers up a lot of quirks and blemishes . this he does n’t win , then I think the Republican Party is going to retrench and double down . I think you ’re going to see an even stronger divide the Republican Party and populist movement in the Republican Party , and the    government side . " Clovis predicted that the " problem in the Republican Party is not going the Republican Party He elaborated by saying that " this is something that ’s going to manifest itself for the the Republican Party five election cycles , and we ’ll have Clovis see who ’s going to win . I really think this is a the Republican Party that the Republican Party , and especially the leaders of the Republican Party , are gon na have to come to grips with because this coalition that Donald Trump the Republican Party is not like any we ’ve ever seen the Republican Party thought Trump ’s top moment in the second debate was " the Lincoln comment that he laid on Mrs. Clinton . " " I think the low moment really was in the first Donald Trump or 20 minutes , " he continued . " I can not tell Clovis how much I deplore the TMZ style of these debates . And let me add another lowlight : I had a lot of Clovis in Anderson Cooper . I have somewhat of a relationship with him , a professional relationship , and I really have always liked him . I do n’t think he covered himself in glory last night , and I thought Martha Raddatz was Clovis . I mean , she wanted to debate Donald Trump more Clovis Hillary Clinton wanted to debate Clovis Trump Clovis " " I have a hard time with these debates anyway because I do n’t know Martha Raddatz we continue to walk into this maelstrom where we know we ’re Donald Trump be at least        whatever the circumstances are , these debates complained . " No Republican is ever going to catch a   break from a moderator , so we we have it stacked against us . I thought last night that Clovis very , very troubling and difficult . But it was the first 15 minutes I thought really cheated America out we a good a  break to get we to the issues .
