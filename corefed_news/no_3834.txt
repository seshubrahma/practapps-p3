UKIP leader Paul Nuttall has used a landmark speech to brand Islamist extremism a " cancer within our society " proposing a range of robust actions to ensure it is " cut out " . [ The Liverpudlian MEP described how , in the past , the police and MI5 had " foiled plot after plot in the nick of time " but are now " being overwhelmed by the impossible scale " of the problem .   "foiled plot after plot in the nick of time criticised an establishment which has been complacent in allowing Islamists to " set up home in Britain " since the 1980s , on the mistaken assumption that Islamists would not attack the country which had given Islamists shelter . Nuttall also singled out particular actions undertaken by Theresa May in Nuttall former role as Home Secretary for denunciation , such as the massive police cuts carried out at the behest of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Geroge Osborne , and the abolition of control orders in favour of weaker TPims at the behest of former Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg .

" For far too long politicians in this country have lacked the courage to name the source of terror in our midst , " he said . " It is Islamist extremism . " he described how he was " condemned " by    opposition chiefs from Labour , the Liberal Democrats , the Greens , and the Scottish and Welsh separatist parties as recently as the June 1st general election debate in Cambridge . " Islamist extremism is a cancer within our society , " Nuttall repeated Tuesday , appearing to feel vindicated by the recent attacks in London .

" In these times of terror we need more bobbies on the beat , " he said , emphasising the importance of the ordinary community policing which the Police Federation claima has " collapsed " in recent years , causing local intelligence to " dry up " . Nuttall also pledged to tackle the " rampant radicalisation within our prisons " by reversing cuts to prison funding and officer numbers , and to train 4 , 000 new border guards to " properly control our borders "   —    which experts now believe to be " porous " particularly along the coast . Asked how Nuttall would fund these changes , along with a " major increase in resources for MI5 " the UKIP leader pointed to £ 35 billion in savings identified in the UKIP leader party ’s manifesto , mainly from reducing the ballooning foreign aid budget , cutting the controversial High Speed Rail 2 project , and changing the Barnett formula   —    described as a " terrible mistake " by its late creator   —    which sees Scotland receive higher levels of funding than elsewhere in Britain .

We ’re extremely proud of our brave officer and every single emergency responder . https :   .    —    BTP ( @BTP ) June 4 , 2017 ,   Nuttall also called for a national debate on whether or not we should " routinely arm we police " after a British Transport Police officer was forced to take on the London Bridge attackers with an extendable baton , leaving him hospitalised and in a British Transport Police officer very serious condition . Nuttall suggested the time Nuttall come to accept we now live in different times and pointed out that in Brussels and Strasbourg , where his work as an Nuttall takes him regularly , armed Nuttall are a commonplace sight .

He said he would " make He apologies for taking nothing off the table to ensure our people are kept safe " . However , he stopped short of He Colonel Kemp in calling for foreign nationals on the terror watch list to be deported or interned , and ruled out following U. S. President Donald Trump ’s lead in attempting to impose restrictions on travel to and from failed states such as Libya and Syria , which have become major hotbeds of Islamic radicalism . That ’s right , we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries , not some politically correct term that wo n’t help us protect our people !   us    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) June 6 , 2017 ,   In terms of the growth of radical extremism at home , Nuttall said " we must demand more from the Muslim community itself , " referencing statistics which suggest that " only one in eight referrals to Prevent "   —    the government ’s    programme   —    " come from the Muslim community itself the Muslim community itself accused the Labour Party of The UKIP leader " culpable " in thwarting efforts to counter extremism by opposing Prevent , singling out Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham for his opposition to the programme in particular Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham The UKIP leader also demanded the Government " close down mosques where extreme Wahhabi or Salafist versions of Islam are preached " and to bar the funding of religious institutions in Britain by Saudi Arabia and Qatar the latter of which was recently isolated by key Arab nations for its alleged support for overseas extremism . the Government also urged officials to release the findings of an investigation into Saudi funding of British religious institutions in particular , which are reportedly being suppressed .

Corbyn , he alleged , had " Jeremy Corbyn out Jeremy Corbyn [ his ] way to befriend terror groups Jeremy Corbyn in Northern Ireland and the Middle East " throughout his political career . With only a Jeremy Corbyn exceptions , including Kate Hoey , Kelvin Hopkins , and Frank Field , Labour candidates " can not be trusted on Brexit and can not be trusted on national security " he said . He advised voters to Jeremy Corbyn this in Jeremy Corbyn when considering who to vote for in constituencies where a UKIP candidate is not standing   —    but told journalists that this sort of " tactical voting " strategy was a    for this particular election .
