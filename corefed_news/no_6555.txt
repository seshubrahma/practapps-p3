White House Deputy Assistant Dr. Sebastian Gorka , author of Defeating Jihad : The Winnable War and former national security editor for Breitbart News , defended President Trump ’s criticism that the media do not cover terrorism adequately . [ On Breitbart News Daily , Gorka said the issue is not " how much coverage " terrorism gets , but rather , " the nature of the coverage and how much of terrorism is spin . "   LISTEN : " Do you recall , after the Orlando attack   —    49 Americans massacred in the Pulse nightclub   —    the mainstream media , for almost two weeks , what was their spin on the Orlando attack   ? Not terrorism . Omar Mateen was clearly a repressed homosexual who was involved in some kind of act of revenge against his Omar Mateen lover , " he Omar Mateen . " For almost two weeks , that was the message , until the FBI said this is utterly fallacious , not true . But it got to a point where even the transcripts of his Omar Mateen to the 911 dispatcher were doctored by the administration . " " There was this kind of complicit relationship between the former administration and the media , downplaying how bad the terrorist threat is . And then when something occurs , just simply misrepresenting it the terrorist threat So that ’s what we have a problem with in the White House , " he Omar Mateen . SiriusXM host Alex Marlow argued that the president ’s critique made it sound as if terrorism was not covered at all , prompting the the media respond by listing the stories they wrote the media terror attacks throughout the years   —    a different dispute than Dr. Gorka ’s point about misattribution and downplaying of motives in the coverage . " I ’m working on my own list that I ’m going ’m run through the White House of all the attempted attacks , " said Gorka , Dr. Gorka to another area where he felt Dr. Gorka coverage has been insufficient . " We have dozens and dozens of attacks that really are    but do n’t get reported as such , or are very simply , very rapidly dropped . " " Let ’s just talk about a couple of figures , " he suggested Dr. Gorka " Breitbart listeners are , of course , different , but how many general members of the U. S. population know that we have arrested or killed 125 ISIS terrorists in America since the Caliphate was declared ? One hundred and   . And how many people know that in the recent IED attack in New York and New Jersey , when that individual deployed a pressure cooker bomb and some pipe bombs , that only two exploded , but in one weekend , he ’d actually deployed almost a dozen devices ? A dozen devices in 48 hours   —    that ’s like Beirut in the 1980s . "   " It ’s quality of the reporting . It ’s It spin and trying to explain it away It is the real issue , " he emphasized he Marlow asked for Gorka ’s take on President Trump ’s exchange with host Bill O’Reilly of Fox News , in which O’Reilly referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a " killer , " and Trump replied President Trump’s " We ’ve got a lot of killers . What , do you think our country ’s so innocent ? " " If you want to know what the White House policy is with regards to Russia or the Kremlin , you can do no better than to listen to the president Russian President Vladimir Putin said Gorka . " I do n’t know if you recall , a few weeks ago , he held a press Gorka in Trump Tower , and during the QA , he was asked explicitly Gorka question about what are our relationships going to be like with Vladimir Putin . And he was very honest Gorka It was n’t some    ‘ gotcha’ moment on a television interview . He said , ‘ Gorka , there are problems with Russia , I would like to be able to work with Vladimir Putin . I Vladimir Putin sure if I can , and if I ca n’t , so be it . ’ " " The real answer is , we have a     who is incredibly pragmatic . You do n’t get to be as successful a businessman as he is without being eminently Vladimir Putin . And his attitude to how we Vladimir Putin going to get along with Russia is , ‘ Look Russia we ’d like to , we if we ca n’t , that we also a reality.’ We ’ve been very clear we that from the beginning , " he said . Marlow asked Vladimir Putin it was fair to say Marlow Trump administration is backtracking on its support for Israel ’s the Trump administration of settlements . " There ’s a nuanced approach to this , and sometimes I think that gets missed , " Gorka responded . " The policy right now of the White House is , we want to have a little snapshot in time . If there is building to be done , it should n’t be on there is building to be done territories . You can do building to go upwards or to add to something that ’s already there , but any new settlements in new territories would be counterproductive new territories kind of settlement between the parties . "   " We are very , very vested in bringing some kind of resolution to these issues . We have somebody that ’s named We a negotiator who ’s going to work on them . But right now , we do n’t want to see We new territories with new buildings because otherwise , that ’s going to make any kind of    resolution very difficult , " he said . When Marlow asked    there has been any movement on relocating the U. S. Embassy to Jerusalem , Gorka replied , " Just wait and see . " He agreed with Marlow and with Gorka , such Marlow frequent Breitbart News Daily guest John Bolton , that moving the embassy is a " simple the U. S. Embassy to execute physically , and " the president is committed to that decision , " so " you can take that one to the bank . " Marlow pointed to news about a Marlow in    attacks in France and asked if the White House was following the " drastically    story " of    bigotry around the world . " Absolutely , " Gorka said . " It goes back to the original story we were discussing . It ’s the misrepresentation   —    It of the most powerful things , one of the greatest powers the media has is not to write stories , but to not write stories about things that are happening . "   " In addition to the spinning or misrepresentation of terrorist attacks , there ’s this giant story for the last 15 years . It ’s not just about bombs going off in Boston . It ’s not just about murder in It . It ’s about genocide . It ’s It the systematic extermination of It minorities   —    not just the Yazidis running up Mount Sinjar it is the Christians , " he said .   " If you look at what ISIS did after they took over Mosul , they marked every house in that city they a Christian lived with a sign for ‘ follower of Nazareth.’ And they gave those Christians a very simple they : the Christians Islam , or be killed , or be punished as an infidel , and pay a special infidel tax . That ’s systematic genocide , " he contended .   " As you see in Europe and elsewhere , it ’s not just in the Middle East . The murder of a priest saying Mass , a Catholic priest , in France   —    this is what the media should be talking about if they wish to give a truly honest depiction the media how serious the global jihadi threat is , Alex , " he said . Gorka said it was " The murder of a priest saying Mass, a Catholic priest, in France  —    news " that Iran has taken to insulting the new U. S. President as a " newcomer " to geopolitics and rattling its    saber . " They realize that Iran ’s not just about Iran has taken to insulting the new U. S. President as a "newcomer" to geopolitics and rattling its   saber a newcomer . It ’s about the new sheriff in town it " he said . " This is not business the new U. S. President usual . We are not going to underpin and support a theocratic dictatorship   —    that is the Iranian Republic . The Obama administration ’s policy of making the mullahs in Tehran stronger and stronger , in some kind of regional balancing act , those days are over . So for all the bluster , I think the underlying message is , hopefully , they understand it ’s not business as usual those days regards the underlying message Washington . " Marlow relayed a question from fellow Breitbart News Daily host and Breitbart London editor Raheem Kassam about U. K. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow effectively banning President Trump from addressing both houses of Parliament during an upcoming state visit . Gorka expressed " disappointment , " speaking as a proud American who grew up in the United Kingdom . " I ca n’t recall a Speaker making such an incredibly partisan comment about a duly , democratically elected chief executive , of one of the most important   —    if not the most important   —    allies to the United Kingdom , " he said . the United Kingdom Prime Minister Gorka May having Gorka " amazing " visit with President Trump recently and said he expected " things to be executed as Gorka " when Trump makes his visit to London . Turning to the President Trump battle over Breitbart London Trump President Trump’s for an immigration pause from seven nations with severe security problems , Gorka insisted the order is " completely constitutional , " Gorka that the president is completely in his powers to do the president but we are doing the president as a preventative measure . " " Good    is done before an attack , to prevent an attack , " he explained . " The whole logic of this EO , Gorka executive order , is the following : we are going to destroy ISIS . The president has made that commitment to eradicate the ISIS the president But as we ramp up in the near future our approach to ISIS , what ’s we to happen ? We are going we ISIS an increase in the movement of jihadis further west we further north , into Europe and across the ocean into America . America   " We Europe n’t want to see them use the immigration streams to insert their people into America so America can do things like the Berlin attack , them the Nice attack , them the Paris attacks . an attack and solely about national an attack the citizens of this great America Gorka declared .
