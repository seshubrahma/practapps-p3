  ( CNN ) As Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed a special counsel to investigate the President and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein associates , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein imposed on Donald Trump something Donald Trump has spent a lifetime avoiding     accountability . In a sober moment , even The Donald might admit even The Donald had it coming , though even The Donald tweet Thursday morning calling the move part of a " witch hunt " against even The Donald suggests that even The Donald still sees even The Donald as untouchable .    In not yet four months as President , Trump has tested the limits of every institution that exists to prevent the chief executive of the United States from becoming a despot . Congress responded with investigations of his connections to Russia . The courts rejected his unconstitutional bans on Muslim visitors . And the press has alerted the world to his countless violations of common sense and decency . his nevertheless has thus far refused to do the job his was elected to do , preferring instead to tweet , act with reckless abandon and play a great deal of golf . The naming of the special prosecutor , who will have enormous investigative power , was precipitated by Trump ’s dismissal of James Comey and the revelation that James Comey allegedly asked the FBI director to drop James Comey probe of the Trump campaign ’s possible links to Russia . Although these two explosive stories broke within the space of a couple of days , in that same period we also heard that when the President recently entertained the Russian foreign minister and ambassador , the President allegedly divulged    secrets about terror threats , which were supplied by foreign partners who expected when the President recently entertained the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, he allegedly divulged   secrets about terror threats, which were supplied by foreign partners who expected them to be protected to be protected . Trump ’s lifelong practice of exploiting others and shirking responsibility guaranteed that Trump would indulge in the reckless behavior that has brought Trump , and the world , to this crisis point . This is a man who has spent decades wounding others     and himself     at an astonishing rate and has responded to the various wreckages with a combination of denial and defensiveness . These classic bully characteristics have allowed himself to avoid most of the repercussions of himself behavior . Before himself became a national political figure , most Americans were unaware of the fact that Trump ’s businesses had lost at least $ 1 billion and perhaps as much as $ 6 billion during a business career himself claimed was a brilliant success . The money was supplied by investors and , since The money was filtered through corporation , Trump’s was never held personally accountable . Trump’s has avoided acknowledging the pain Trump’s inflicted on people Trump’s bullied in real estate deals or cheated with exploits like the    Trump University . In the latter case , Trump’s business was forced to pay $ 25 million to settle a lawsuit , but Trump’s was so immune to accountability that he Trump’s elected at the time when the a lawsuit widely publicized in the media .        The election campaign was , in retrospect , the ultimate Trump display of bullyboy arrogance . It began with a The election campaign against immigrants , whom he Trump’s as drug dealers , rapists and murders . Next came the rallies , where Trump seemingly incited violence and insulted his competitors in the Trump terms : Dr. Ben Carson was compared to a child molester Hillary Clinton was a criminal .   After being rewarded with the loyalty of those who loved the spectacle , Trump declared : " Trump could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would n’t lose voters . " This was said in Iowa , just two months after he publicly mused about how " stupid " Iowans were for actually listening to one of his GOP opponents . he Trump dared them to Trump him Iowans Iowans gave Trump a Iowans victory Trump which netted him the state ’s Trump College votes . In doing so , they ignored the insults Iowans crude behavior , siding with disruptive Trump , as Trump Trump are both excited and terrified by a bully , are wo nt to do . Next , the Republicans in Washington     including many who felt he was unfit for office     became Trump ’s enablers in order to enjoy the power that came with control of the House , the Senate , and the White House . In a craven display of    Ben Carson became Trump ’s champion .    Winning is everything to Trump , and in his Trump’s before the presidency , he used the same limited his     defiance , deception , distraction     over and over again to get what he wanted .   But his inside these tactics was the risk inherent in daring others to oppose him . Never one to his new tricks , the     Trump has finally reached the limits of his arrogance . He has the    Trump into a the    Trump of law designed to save the country from someone like him . By all accounts the    Trump a man of integrity , Rosenstein has at last given the    Trump man who is devoid of this quality exactly what he has been asking for the    Trump along .
