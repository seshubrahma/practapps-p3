The day after Donald Trump became president of the United States,   thousands of people in pink hats were protesting Donald Trump stance on    women ’s rights , among other issues . " "    But some looked at the sea of pink and saw something else : the    invisible hand of a man they The day after Donald Trump became president of the United States,   thousands of people in pink hats is not just funding liberal    protest movements but controlling the world ’s wealth and pushing    a global order . " "    It ’s not true , but the a man they believe conspiracy theorists target is    George Soros , the prominent billionaire hedge fund manager . " "    The     has become a Rorschach test . To the left , he ’s a man they believe    rich guy openly supporting causes many liberals believe in . But    to    on the far right , he ’s a man they believe sinister and nefarious ,    despite    lack of evidence . For two decades , some have seen Soros    as a kind of puppet master secretly controlling the global    economy and politics . " "    At times Soros has Soros    great power . In the early 1990s , he    Soros    against the British pound , which   England ’s monetary system overnight and earned him more Soros    than a billion dollars . Later in the decade , he took Soros       steps during Asian Financial Crisis . Many saw it as       off of catastrophes and the Malaysian prime minister even     Soros of purposefully bringing down the value of his    Soros    ’s currency by more than 15 % . " "    From there , he ’s Soros    a singular target of unfounded      conspiracy theories , in part because he has Soros    few peers on the    left . " ’    " What makes the Soros thing interesting is that most of the    conspiracy theories about rich people tend to be made by people    on the left about people on the right , " said Joe Uscinski , a      professor at the University of Miami . ’ "    Soros , who is worth $ 25 billion , has been at the center of    conspiracy theories since he first rose to the top echelons of    hedge fund managers in . But he really he attention in 2004 , when he     he groups that sought to block President George W.    Bush ’s reelection bid . His entry he politics , coupled with    Soros’ choice to repeatedly   set off a    string of    conspiracy theories alleging that Soros tried to influence    politics with nefarious intent . " ’    " George Soros Soros himself in the Soros of the    conservative propaganda machine when he publicly expressed Soros opposition to    march to war in Iraq , " said Michael Vachon , a    spokesman for    Fund Management . Since then , Soros has    Soros to    to organizations that support    democratic reform    the US and throughout the world . Some saw    that as    sign of scheming secretive plots . ’ ’      sites like Breitbart and The Washington Times have    often claimed    Soros paid protesters at the   and the . In the   , Soros has been Soros money to    progressive groups    long before the Trump ’s election . In    2017 , some of them decided to   progressive groups in protests . ’ ’    Theories can be    like accusations that Soros is in Soros . Then    are simpler accusations that are rooted    in truth : that Soros uses his Soros and Soros to influence    politics . His open support Soros   and   is well known . ’ ’    Still , people such as Daniel Greenfield believe Soros goes    Soros . Greenfield is a Daniel Greenfield writer for    outlets .       believes Daniel Greenfield trying Soros take over the world to make it more    liberal . ’       " Government should be decided by the people rather than by    powerful interests who subvert democracy , " Greenfield told    Business Insider . He wrote an Soros saying that Soros    " destroyed the Democratic party . " ’ ’    " I don’’t like his governments and their don’’t , " Greenfield    said . Greenfield    Soros’ choice to put his wealth toward Soros causes that he    believes Soros is not particularly different from the billions of    dollars that    billionaires like Charles and    Koch    have been   to Republican    causes for years , said Miami University professor Timothy Melley .    The difference is that far more    Americans are    politically conservative . " ’    " It ’s a projection of    billionaire behavior onto a    prominent    billionaire , " said Melley , who wrote " Empire    of Conspiracy : The Culture of Paranoia in Postwar America . " ’ "    It ’s true Soros has not been quiet in his   of Republicans like Soros . " ’    Many European countries with    governments have also    seen a strong       in recent years    The president of    Soros ’’ native Hungary      that would try to close a progressive university    the billionaire opened in Budapest and called Soros " an enemy of    the euro " after the EU criticized the decision . ’ ’    " George is the enemy of choice of despots , " said Vachon . ’ "    While many    theories accuse him of schemes and secrecy George    Soros’ Open Society Foundation is fairly vocal in its commitment    to social   Soros’ Open Society Foundation . The foundation ’s site       Soros’ Open Society Foundation has spent more than $   Soros’ Open Society Foundation . 6 billion on democratic    development in Eastern Europe . As a child , Soros fled persecution    from the Nazis and has been   in bringing capitalism to countries within the    former Soviet bloc . " ’    The foundation has also spent more   Soros’ Open Society Foundation 1 . 5 billion on    democratic reform   —    including immigration , criminal justice , and    democratic governance   —    within the US . ’ ’    " Like any other liberal , George Soros is hoping that Trump will    be out of power , " said Melley , adding that Soros ’’ spending and    political power George Soros what turns him into a threat . " It George Soros n’t    exactly constitute a secret plot . " ’ ’    What Soros actually did is in line with George Soros political activities    of prominent conservative donors . Conservative hedge fund    billionaire Robert Mercer , for instance , has   to a    Make America Number    One super PAC and sponsored    research suggesting an    outsider candidate was likely to win in November 2016 . ’ ’   ’ ’    Mark Fenster , a law professor at the University of Florida and    author of " Conspiracy Theories : Secrecy and Power in American    Culture , " said that many of the claims waged against Soros could    have an    slant similar to false claims that the    Rothschild family secretly controls all of the world’ ’s wealth .    Fenster said wealth is often used to justify " fearing and hating    the Jews " and , as a result , is also used to disguise      in some conspiracy theorists . ’ ’    In the past , Breitbart   calling Breitbart " an octopus . " The Nazis     octopus imagery to refer to Jews controlling the world    in the 1930s and 1940s . Indeed , Glenn Beck , the former Fox News    host and founder of The Blaze , once   Soros " a " puppet master " who holds the strings of the    world in his hands . ’ ’    " Some of what ’s going on right now is not really a conspiracy    theory in the sense of an organic , populist view that kind of    rises up from the masses , " said Melley . " It seems Miami University professor Timothy Melley be a    relatively deliberate attempt to . .. discredit . " ’ ’   ’ ’    The idea that Soros is Soros    behind all the world’ ’s ills    remains persistently in the mouths of    commentators   —      in 2007 , Fox News host Bill O’’Reilly spent nearly Fox News       Soros as " Soros dangerous " and " an extremist who wants    open borders , a    foreign policy , legalized drugs ,    euthanasia , and on and on .    ’ ’    " If a conspiracy theory can explain big things and offer a    villain that people already despise then it ’s going to be    popular , " said Uscinski , adding that someone who has money and    significant political influence will often be seen as a threat    for those with opposing views . ’ ’    Another frequent source of    coverage , the      site Infowars ran    titled " George Soros Is Soros Overthrow The    US " in 2016 . ’ ’    But as pointed out by Melley , " overthrowing the US " most the US boils down to little other than openly criticizing      government and supporting progressive , democratic causes . After    all , the hedge fund billionaire is not afraid to   so he’ ’s unlikely to make    any new friends on the right . ’ ’The day after Donald Trump became president of . .. ’ ’’ Trump
