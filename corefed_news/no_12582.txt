DES MOINES , Iowa   —    Corey Lewandowski , the campaign manager for 2016 GOP frontrunner Donald Trump , exposed a blatant conflict of interest on Wednesday that the Fox News Channel has been hiding for months . [ Lewandowski showed how the Fox News Channel has been hiding the fact that Fox the Fox News Channel President Bill Sammon has a daughter working for the campaign of the Washington    Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) .   Sammon ’s daughter Fox News Channel Vice President Bill Sammon Brooke Sammon , is Rubio ’s national press secretary , and obviously both have a vested interest in the success of the Rubio campaign and the demise of the other campaigns . CNN ’s Erin Burnett asked Lewandowski about Fox News ’s controversial    statement from Tuesday evening —   and specifically the network ’s claim that the top Trump aide had allegedly made threats against Fox News anchor Fox News debate    Megyn Kelly —   when he responded by dropping   Megyn Kelly explosive revelation . Lewandowski revealed two Lewandowski for the first time : that the executive he was discussing Lewandowski with was Bill Sammon , and that Sammon ’s daughter Brooke Sammon works for Rubio ’s campaign , giving the    Floridian Senator an obvious boost . That blatant conflict of interest has never before been disclosed to the viewers of Fox News by the network . " Not only did I not make threats , but the conversation with the Fox News executive — Fox News daughter works for the Rubio campaign , he ’s one of the his on Fox that writes the debate questions so maybe he has his own ulterior his , his ’m not sure , " Lewandowski told Burnett in the Wednesday evening CNN interview . He went on : But Lewandowski daughter is a senior Lewandowski the Rubio campaign , maybe he the Rubio campaign before he ’s writing Lewandowski debate questions for Fox Lewandowski There were no threats made . Lewandowski bottom line is this is n’t about me and it ’s not about Megyn Kelly Lewandowski It this about the way that Fox News this out a statement about Mr. Trump that ’s wholly inaccurate and unfair and it ’s very difficult to treat someone fairly this they ’re the GOP frontrunner when you put out a statement like that . When Burnett followed up , Lewandowski doubled down . " What I said was the Fox News executive who oversees the debate process Fox News daughter is a senior executive on the Marco the Fox News executive who oversees the debate process campaign —   is what I said , " the Trump campaign manager said . A Fox News spokesperson has not responded to Breitbart News Fox News for comment throughout the day on Wednesday . A Rubio spokesman , communications director Alex Conant , responded Conant by standing up for Breitbart News and questioning Breitbart News ’s integrity . " It ’s no secret Breitbart Breitbart News conspiracy theories , but this accusation is a whole Breitbart News level of crazy , " Conant said in an email . " Brooke is a star of our campaign and her integrity and professionalism is second to none . If you Brooke Sammon worried about someone ’s integrity , you Brooke Sammon do some serious self examination . " Conant has not answered a pair of    questions . One question Conant wo n’t answer centers specifically on Conant Brooke Sammon has ever in any way communicated with her father Conant the Rubio campaign —   including regarding debate matters . The other question Conant wo n’t Brooke Sammon is why , if " Breitbart traffics in conspiracy theories , " Sen. Rubio ’s Conant provides Breitbart News with exclusives like the one earlier on Wednesday about his new ad targeting Evangelical voters . " I believe you ca n’t have a strong America without strong Conant . I believe in the fundamental freedoms that make us great . And I believe in God that God has blessed America , " Sen. Rubio says in a new he provided exclusively to Breitbart News , God instance . America and his Sen. Rubio’s Breitbart News with that exclusive Sen. Rubio’s hours before changing Breitbart News on Breitbart News . Bill Sammon is Conant Fox News Breitbart News President and the bureau chief of that network Conant and his team Washington , Breitbart News team . Several times leading up to the previous Megyn     debate back in August 2015 , it was confirmed that Sammon was personally involved in crafting the entire focus of the debate . For instance , on Howard Kurtz ’s Aug. 2 Media Bill Sammon show on the Fox News Channel , Kurtz and Fox ’s Chris Stirewalt confirmed that Sammon is the " secret weapon " crafting the questions . " You ’ve been Howard Kurtz’s this rodeo before , " Kurtz asked Bill Sammon . " How do you and Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier and Chris Wallace go about formulating your questions , Howard Kurtz’s the Chris Stirewalt are going to try to pivot to their talking points ? " " Well , the first thing is we have a secret weapon and that is Bill Sammon , the candidates is the best at not only team cohesion and keeping everybody on point about what the point is , but in crafting the questions , " Stirewalt replied before Kurtz interjected that Sammon is the Fox News Channel ’s " Washington bureau chief . " " Absolutely , he ’s a managing editor and a great mind and a great journalist and so that is a big help , " Stirewalt Kurtz . In addition , a Washington Post    profile of Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace —   one of the Stirewalt debate moderators alongside Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier —   confirmed Sammon ’s involvement in crafting the narrative of the debate . Of course , that profile quotes Wallace as saying he has several " doozies " prepared for GOP frontrunner Donald Trump . " On a recent Thursday morning , Chris Wallace —   walked the Chris Wallace —   steps from his small ,    office   —    his father ’s Rolodex , a photo of him Chris Wallace —   hoops with Michael Jordan   Chris Wallace —      to the more spacious suite of Chris Wallace —   boss , Bill Sammon , the vice Chris Wallace —   of news , who had called together a small    meeting , " the Chris Wallace —   ’s Krissah Thompson wrote . Thompson then detailed what the    room was like one day when Wallace and Sammon prepared for battle , quoting the two of Krissah Thompson extensively —   and making clear that Sammon was in charge . What ’s interesting , however , is that these people Wallace and Sammon who claim to be journalists —   Sammon , Baier , Kelly , Stirewalt , Kurtz , and pretty much everyone else at the Fox News Channel , especially Sammon —   all committed what is pretty much a cardinal sin in journalism : They did n’t disclose a major conflict of interest ahead of a presidential debate . That conflict , of course , is that these people, who claim to be journalists —  Wallace, Baier, Kelly, Stirewalt, Kurtz, and pretty much everyone else at the Fox News Channel, especially Sammon —  all committed what is pretty much a cardinal sin in journalism Sammon —   Rubio ’s national press secretary —   is the daughter of a major conflict of interest executive Bill Sammon . Brooke Sammon is no small player in Rubio ’s orbit , either . She ’s second in command to Rubio communications chief Alex Conant Brooke Sammon has worked for the senator for Rubio . The network did not Brooke Sammon this conflict of interest to Rubio —   most importantly , the 24 million people who watched that first debate this summer . It ’s unclear why the network has hidden this detail . Other GOP presidential campaigns have been whispering about    bias at Fox , but The network have been willing The network hammer the network , except for Trump . Lewandowski has gotten close to exposing this conflict of interest before —   making an allusion to it on The network America on Wednesday morning —   but not until his CNN appearance was he so explicit . " It ’s a shame , —   you have a conversation with some of the Fox executives , you Lewandowski hope they ’d Lewandowski that conversation private , —   Lewandowski said on GMA . " Instead you have executives over there who Lewandowski relatives working for other campaigns some of the Fox executives These are a conversation with some of the Fox executives who are putting debate questions together .
