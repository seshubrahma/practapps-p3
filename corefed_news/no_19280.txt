’   ’ "    My colleagues Oliver Darcy and Pamela Engel have   of the Republican    Party ’s captivity to its own disinformation complex of talk    radio and conservative websites that push both extremism and    false information . " ’    Donald Trump has been helped by a    environment    in which there is no penalty for being wrong all the time , for    being openly bigoted , or for being obviously doomed to failure in    a general election . ’ "    I just want to note that the Republican Party can not be    fixed through the taming of the Republican Party most committed members’ favorite    media outlets . The popularity of    figures who fill Republicans’ heads with disinformation     —    people like Sean Hannity and Alex Jones and Matt Drudge   —      is mostly a symptom of the problems in the party , not a    cause . " ’    So before they try to bring figures like Sean Hannity to heel ,    conservatives should consider how someone like him came to be so    popular within conservatives movement . ’ ’    If they look honestly enough , they will realize the conservative    information sphere has long been full of lies . The reason for    this is that lying has been the most effective way to    promote many of the policies favored by      conservatives , and so conservatives built an apparatus to invent and    spread the best lies . ’ "    For example , wealthy conservatives favor lower taxes on    wealthy conservatives for the obvious reason that this lets wealthy conservatives keep more    wealth for wealthy conservatives . This is sensible enough from a perspective    of    and a defensible idea under some moral systems    ( Ayn Rand ’s , for example ) but it is not a compelling electoral    argument . " ’    So , conservatives built a network of think tanks    and magazines and pressure groups funded by wealthy    donors whose job was to come up with arguments that would sell    the donor class agenda to the masses . ’ ’    In a substantial number of happy instances , there was a valid    case to be made that what was good for the rich donors was also    good for everyone else , and these organs made a valid   case to be made that what was good for the rich donors was also   good for everyone else . ’ "    When there was n’t such a case , conservatives had two options :    abandon their conservatives , or make something up and    do their conservatives to sell it . Prior to the creation of the broad    conservative information apparatus , conservatives    had done a fair bit of the former : Making peace with the New    Deal , for example , after repeated electoral shellackings in the    1930s and 1940s . " ’   ’ ’    In recent years , they the creation of the broad   conservative information apparatus, conservatives    increasingly chosen the latter option . ’ ’    For example , conservative think tanks have put out elaborate    models , purporting to show enormously positive economic benefits    from Republican plans to cut taxes on owners of capital and    spending on social programs . The point of these models is to show       fiscal policy that would seem to be    regressive is actually good for everyone . ’ ’    These these models on assumptions that are outside the    mainstream of economic opinion and overstate the economic    benefits of regressive fiscal policy . That is , they lie these models    ( See , for example ,   for The New York Times last year and   in 2011 . )   ’ "    Climate change is another area where conservative disinformation    has    dressed up with numbers and eyeglasses . In each case ,    the    lies come with math that is supposed to give the    lies an aura of authority . " ’    This    approach    disinformation has led to    a    set of conventions about which lies are okay to tell    and    are not . For example , you can promise your tax    cuts will generate 4 % economic growth ; 5 % is considered silly .    Or    you must place your objection to    mitigation    downstream of the question of changing climate , rather than    outright    that global temperatures are rising . ’ "    Trump ’s contribution to conservative messaging has not been the    introduction of widespread lying . Rather , it has been his    Trump that you do n’t have to just lie about what the donors    want lied about , and you do n’t need a fake model , because    nobody    paying attention to the numbers anyway . " ’    You don’’t need an elaborate approach to " dynamic scoring . " You    can    say , " I’’ll make us so rich , " and mutter some nonsense    about    trade deficit , and you can convince approximately the    same set of voters . ’ ’   ’ "    You do n’t need a clever replotting of climate data when you can    just    the whole thing is a conspiracy invented by the Chinese . " ’    Trump lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and he does Trump    even    his supporters Trump to lie well . You    would    he would    in trouble for this , but Republican    elites have spent so many years intentionally discrediting the    media    policy experts and others who would dare to tell the    truth about the public policy that his lies    , in fact ,    convincing    for the conservative base . ’ "    As a result , the trouble with establishment conservatives’    complaints about new conservative media is that they ’re new conservative media    really committed to an honest politics , just to a    differently dishonest politics . " ’    Trump talks about a ( fake ) crime epidemic and a ( fake )    invasion of Mexican criminals and a ( fake ) Chinese trade    conspiracy and a ( fake ) plot to rig the election . Do    conservative elites hate these claims because they are these claims , or    because they are these claims that do nothing in particular to advance    the interests of elite conservatives ? ’ "    Conservative elites might hope to put the lies back in their    Conservative elites , where the subject matter of the lies the lies by    wealthy donors ( establishment ones , ) who care mostly about taxes    and not the restoration of overt racism   —    and where the    quality of the lies becomes the lies low , so it ’s not    the   quality of the lies hard to go defend them on Conservative elites news without feeling like an    idiot . " "    That ’s not going to work for a couple of reasons , the main one of    which is that Trump ’s lies are more fun for Republican voters    than the usual set of lies . Another reason is that the old rules    boxing in the lies never made much sense   —    if you can say a    $ 4 trillion tax cut will pay for itself , why not a   $4 trillion tax cut $ 10 trillion    one ? " "    You can most easily tell you ca n’t put the conservative media    back in the box when you consider one of its most powerful         —    email forwards and Facebook memes , which are    controlled by no authority and make profits for nobody ( except    Facebook ) . " ’    These media reflect the huge demand for    lies   —    even    if you shame Hannity out of the business , someone else will rise    up to offer these lies . The   lies   not ever regain control    over the machine . ’ ’    Furthermore , establishment Republicans should be careful    about any plan to    on sunshine and reality and facts as    the antidote to Trumpism , as they will need to be establishment Republicans to    face uncomfortable facts of    own . ’ " establishment Republicans A    environment would n’t just stop candidates from    running on a platform    bombing ISIS to take the oil and    getting Mexico to pay    the wall so we can beat China and be so    rich . A       will also be    inhospitable for    ordinary Republican policy platforms    the sort advanced by Ted    Cruz and Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush . " "    Bush ’s   was n’t Jeb Bush honest than Donald Trump ’s    promises , it was just more artful . " "    If Republicans want to tell the truth and win elections ,    they ’re going to have to Republicans want to tell the truth and win elections,    different policy ideas   —      and that ’s why they lie . "
