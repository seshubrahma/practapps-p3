BREAKING : Yale Econ 115 professor makes midterm exam optional after students write in expressing shock about presidential election : pic . twitter .    —    Jon Victor ( @jon_victor _ ) November 9 , 2016 ,   You can read the entirety of the email below : Dear Econ 115 Students , I am getting many heartfelt notes from students who are in shock over the election returns . ( Although as I write this the election has not presidential election . ) The ones I find most upsetting are those who fear , rightly or wrongly , for their own families . These The ones I find most upsetting are requesting that Dear Econ 115 Students be postponed . On the other hand , I am sure that many students have sacrificed to prepare for the test . Further , it is not easy to reschedule exam rooms at this late date . Finally , postponing the exam would throw off the rest of the schedule as well . Therefore , I am making the exam optional . I will the exam student ’s grade both with and without exam 2 , placing all of exam 2 ’s weight on the final exam when exam 2 is omitted . I will then take , for each student , the maximum of the two final grades ( with and without the exam ) . Those maximum scores will then be used for the final curve . So , feel free to make either decision tomorrow ( or today , if you are reading this in the AM ) .
