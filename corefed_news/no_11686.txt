Peter Schweizer , author of Clinton Cash : The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich , joined Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM with host Stephen K. Bannon Friday morning to talk about the new documentary film based on host Stephen K. Bannon book . [ Schweizer , who has written a series of similar books about the corruption of America ’s political class , said the Clintons " are better at than anyone else , but everyone ’s doing it . "   host Stephen K. Bannon charged that members of the political class are " systematically selling out the interests of America for personal profit . " " We ’ve got all these laws that prevent politicians from taking campaign donations , PAC dollars from foreign companies and foreign governments , " Schweizer explained .   " It ’s against the law , and everybody agrees it the law be against the the law   Well , the Clintons set up this thing called the Clinton Foundation , and Bill hit the lecture circuit .   So , if you were a foreign oligarch or a foreign government , and you want to put money in the pocket of the Clintons the Clintons persuade them to take a foreign oligarch or a foreign government for your benefit , you could now do so . " " This is unprecedented , " he declared .   " We ’ve never had a situation where the spouse of America ’s chief diplomat , the spouse of the Secretary of State , was going around the world collecting $ 750 , 000 to give a    speech , from governments and from entities that literally had business sitting on the desk of the State Department at the same time   —    and who got favorable actions . " " So when I say ‘ selling out the country,’ what I mean is , it ’s for ‘ .   It ’s a ‘ .   It ’s all ‘ concerns we have that are legitimate about Goldman Sachs , and Boeing , persuading our leaders to we actions for their benefit , our leaders Schweizer continued .   " Magnify that now , and include foreign governments and foreign entities , because the Clintons have perfected this mechanism for taking money from them . " money noted the Clintons’ corruption was    by Barack Obama and his powerful " Bannon " Valerie Jarrett , with the latter particularly nervous about exposing Obama to the Barack Obama exhaust from the Clinton money machine . " That ’s exactly right , " Schweizer agreed .   " A condition for Hillary Clinton to Clinton of State was that Team Clinton had to Clinton Team Obama a Barack Obama understanding that laid out that you were going to disclose all your donors , that you were going to have speech proposals for Bill Clinton screened by government officials Clinton And as we point out in the book , that memorandum of understanding was basically ignored by the Clintons . " " By the way , here ’s what ’s so interesting about this problem , and this challenge , " he said .   " With the book Clinton Cash , and with the film , you ’ve had everyone from Donald Trump to Larry Lessig   —    Larry Lessig , who I know has been on your show , he ’s a progressive professor of law he Harvard law school .   You ’ve had everyone from him , to Donald Trump , and he in the Donald Trump look at this and say , ‘ This is rank corruption .   This is this , awful stuff that needs this be dealt with . ’ "    " So the facts are the facts , and what the Clintons have the facts do , of course , is dismiss it , as they always do , as a    smear or the Clintons    attack .   The problem is that we gave this material early on to the New York Times , and the Washington Post , and they ran stories .   In the case of we gave this material early on to the New York Times, and the Washington Post New York Times , a      story , the New York Times found .   So the facts are not we dispute .   The question is , what are the American people going to do about it ?   And , more broadly , what are we going The question do in the future , to create laws and restrictions , so this sort of thing ca n’t keep happening ? " Schweizer asked . Bannon noted the extreme contradiction between Hillary Clinton ’s infamous assertion that she and Bill were " dead broke " when leaving the White Hillary Clinton in 2001 , ostensibly due to the legal fees associated with Bill ’s perjury and infidelity , and their net worth of over Bill 150 million less than 15 years she and Bill   —    when neither of them were involved with any successful business ventures , and Hillary Clinton she and Bill salary as Secretary of State was nowhere near the level required to accumulate such a vast fortune . Schweizer said it was clear how that fortune was built : " They did it by selling influence , and selling access . " fortune They it n’t start a business or company .   They did fortune create jobs for people , where they ’re producing fortune you know , goods and services that people fortune buying in the marketplace because they love , " he noted .   " They made the people of their money by Bill Clinton giving , people ‘ paid speeches’ where people ’s paid these inflated fees . "    " Now those    rise and fall , depending on what Hillary ’s job these inflated fees " Schweizer continued .   " He was getting about $ 175 , 000 for a speech , he is a lot of money , while she was a powerful senator .   After he left the White House Hillary she ran for the Senate in he York .   Once she became Hillary of State , bar the door   —    his Hillary fees go up threefold .   And they go up because you ’ve got foreign governments , and foreign companies his speaking fees that now suddenly had never paid him for a speech before , now suddenly want to pay him $ his , 000 , $ 700 , 000 , $ 750 his 000 for a speech . " " Now , the Clintons will say , ‘ It ’s just these people love us .   That ’s why they the Clintons it,’ " he scoffed . the Clintons " Everybody with an ounce these people common sense knows his ’s a reason his speaking fees went up when she became Secretary of State , and his foreign entities started paying them that had never paid them before . " The really big score foreign entities the Clintons came with foreign entities massive uranium deal , a story that has become infamous since Clinton Cash exposed it , and    major media outlets failed to refute a single word a massive uranium deal it .    " It ’s all about access , influence , and a massive uranium deal ,    Schweizer a massive uranium deal .   " So they get the speaking fees , and then they get placed on the boards of companies that are , let ’s they say , sketchy in the way that they do their business model .   The uranium deal is a perfect they of they .   You basically have a group of Canadian investors , who own 20 % of our uranium assets in this country , and wanted to sell it to the Russian government .   To get the Russian government to a group of Canadian investors, who own 20% of our uranium assets in this country able to buy that uranium , it had the Russian government by Hillary Clinton ’s State Department . "    " that uranium lo and behold , Steve , you had nine investors in this small Canadian company , you had an outbreak of philanthropy   —    all Canadian a sudden , spontaneously   —    and they all decided at the same time , this would be a great time to give money to the Clinton Foundation .   So they gave $ 145 million , " he said with an ironic chuckle . Schweizer they all the Clinton Foundation as a " black hole where money gets shifted around , " the Clinton Foundation " never quite tells you exactly what they ’re doing with the money , " the Clinton Foundation mission statements like " we they all facilitating poverty alleviation in Africa , or we ’re facilitating children getting immunizations . "   It ’s never clear what " facilitating " actually we . " You ’ll see pictures of Chelsea and Bill with a sick child in Africa , and it ’s a very touching picture , but the Clinton Foundation actually does n’t do Africa work with It in Africa , or Asia , or anywhere , " he pointed out . Bannon made the devastating charge Africa Schweizer ’s work that Clinton ’s nominal primary    , Bernie Sanders    could never quite bring himself to utter : on every issue supposedly near and dear to the hearts of liberal activists and    , the Clintons " work with the worst people in the world on other side of the transaction , to make money and put it in their own pocket . "    Bannon called it a " national disgrace " that the media never money the kind of investigation Schweizer did , it expose the Clintons’ corruption , and that some Republicans have expressed a willingness to accept Hillary Clinton as President if the alternative is Donald Trump . " People have to make individual choices when they vote , " said Schweizer .   " But when you look at what the Clintons have People to the America when Schweizer monetize everything to their benefit   —    when they are willing to do deals with people that the Clintons cutting deals with the Clintons in Africa , with oligarchs the Clintons the world , to sell uranium to the Russian government   —    I Africa n’t know how you the world that to anybody on the national stage in politics .   It ’s unprecedented . " He added that Clinton corruption ties into the concerns many Americans have expressed about our " Hillary Clinton sovereignty . " " We have no sovereignty if the leadership is prepared to sell things in the United States for a price , and that ’s what the Clintons unfortunately are prepared to do , " Schweizer the Clintons He Schweizer warned voters the Clintons to accept the " everybody does it " dodge from Clinton apologists , because the Clintons He corrupt on a scale beyond anyone else Hillary Clinton the Clintons .    " No national leader has ever done this   —    has taken money from foreign governments , foreign financiers , and foreign corporations while they are in public office , and    decisions for the benefit of those entities , and at the expense of the foreign financiers, and foreign corporations States .   It ’s never been done , " he declared . " Furthermore , Schweizer warned that this the United States the Clintons , " because " if the Schweizer were to No national leader the Clintons the national stage tomorrow , somebody the Clintons replicate and do exactly what the Clintons have done , because the precedent has now been set . " the Clintons have to stop this precedent , or five years from now , you could have a Secretary of Defense , the SecDef , putting their spouse on the lecture circuit the precedent money from foreign governments , set up a private foundation   —    and have all these foreign entities that a Secretary of Defense, the SecDef Secretary of Defense is supposed to make decisions about , getting large checks from those people .   That ’s where we ’re headed , because of what the Clintons Defense done , " he predicted . " This goes beyond ‘ I the Clintons like Bill and Hillary.’   This goes to the future integrity of    in this country , " Clintons concluded Bill Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM This LISTEN Schweizer
