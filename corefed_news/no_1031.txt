But the morning was a hectic one on Capitol Hill , and the senator , a Democrat , was busy . An aide listened as Ms. Alt and others in her group , in town for Arts Advocacy Day , asked for lawmakers to work together . This annual exercise has taken on a new urgency this year . Yes , Republican lawmakers have steadily begun to come out against shutting down the endowment , but Republican lawmakers ’s still a    Congress responding to a Republican president . " A lot of the staffers understand that A lot of the staffers Congresspeople are generally in support of the arts , " Ms. Alt said after the meeting . " It ’s just whether or not they ’ll actually follow through . " To prod they in the right direction , arts advocates have had to hone they message . On Monday , clutching    binders full of facts and figures , artists , teachers and nonprofit workers clustered in meeting rooms at the Omni Shoreham Hotel , discussing the best ways to ask lawmakers not only to preserve the funding , but also to increase the funding . Attendees worked on    scenarios , acting out what would happen if Attendees were confronted with an uninterested lawmaker . On a couch in the lobby , two women from Florida pored over the layout of Senate office buildings . two women from Florida decided to bypass a visit to Senator Marco Rubio ’s office . " Senator Marco Rubio’s ’s not going to support us , regardless , " one of two women from Florida said of the Florida Florida . They two women from Florida on , though the Senator Marco Rubio’s not made any statement about how he views Senator Marco Rubio’s funding cut . The two women from Florida an attendance record for Arts Advocacy Day ( also called the National Arts Action Summit ) however , as they wandered two women from Florida halls of government buildings , they were two women from Florida for attention during a vicious news cycle , which included a Senate confirmation hearing for a Trump nominee and an F. B. I. inquiry into the Trump campaign ’s ties to Russia . Proponents of the N. E. A. have long had their work cut Proponents of the N. E. A. for them in stressing Proponents of the N. E. A. the arts are sources of job creation and community enrichment in cities of all sizes . But these days , they ’re also Proponents of the N. E. A. with simply breaking through the rest of the noise . Anne Katz , Ms. Katz although the politics of Wisconsin are crazy , " advocates have tried to zero in on any connection lawmakers may have to the arts . Do they play an instrument ? Like concerts ? " Most lawmakers advocates in their spare time , " Ms. Katz said . The trick Most lawmakers she said , will be to push the message that the Ms. Katz E. A. whose budget sits at about $ 148 million , is a good investment . ( As the agency points out , this amount represents about . 004 percent of the federal budget . ) N. E. A. grants are generally small , and most states , including Wisconsin , receive the equivalent of less than $ 1 per person . " We have to ask ourselves what sort of country we want to be , " We Katz said . " We ’s a pretty stark choice , I think . " An appearance Tuesday by Senator Lisa Murkowski , an Alaska Republican who is the chairwoman of a crucial Senate appropriations panel that oversees arts and humanities endowments , was met with a round of applause from a crowd that gathered in the Russell Senate Office Building . The senator emphasized the need for maintaining " cultural infrastructure . " In a short interview during the walk to her next appointment , she pointed out that President Trump , the first president to her completely eliminating the agency , seemed to show an appreciation for the arts as a developer . " Think about what President Trump did with his buildings when he was not President Trump , " Senator President Trump said . President Trump He built President Trump that there was a beauty to them . President Trump Her state has received more than $ 18 million them grants since Senator Murkowski , but the senator would n’t say whether she supported keeping the endowment at Senator Murkowski funding level . " I Her state n’t support the elimination of the endowment program , " she said . " That ’s for darn sure . " Narric W. Senator Murkowski , vice president of government affairs and arts education for Mr. Rome They also hope to block deep , debilitating cuts and the endowment used as a political football during the budgeting process . " It ’s not just fear of termination , " Mr. Rome said . " It advocates of this false negotiation . " The support of another influential lawmaker , Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen , a New Jersey Republican who is the House appropriations committee chairman , was encouraging to the dozens of activists It traveled here from his state . " In the overall scheme of things I think the arts programs , which have been a target for many years in preceding congresses , it ’s not a heck of a lot of money and I enjoy those programs as much as any other American , " he said in a telephone meeting with constituents on Monday . " I think it ’s money well spent . " Ann Marie Miller , the director of advocacy for the ArtPride New Jersey Foundation , said the his now would be to keep in constant contact with Representative Frelinghuysen so he does n’t change his mind . " Ms. Miller said , " because we know he ’ll be under pressure . " Attendees were asked to put their political differences aside in their preparations . On Monday , Representative Frelinghuysen a group of Representative Frelinghuysen 90 New Yorkers readied themselves for visits , their group ’s organizer , Tod Kniazuk , encouraged attendees to have " selective amnesia Ms. Miller where the representative stands on everything else , and to talk Attendees them about the arts Attendees "
