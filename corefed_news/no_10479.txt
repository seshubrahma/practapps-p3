[ Angela Davis  —   the famed 1960s communist agitator who is a hero to the Black Lives Matter movement  —    suggests that November ’s presidential election is " one river that we have to cross " and that Angela Davis  —   the famed 1960s communist agitator who is a hero to the Black Lives Matter movement  —    thinks by electing Hillary Clinton radical activists " will be able to begin the process of building a movement that will transform   —    in a revolutionary manner . "   Davis’ pronouncement got notice from black websites such as The Root , and Atlanta Black Star , where the headline was Angela Davis Claims There Will Be a Political Revolution , Just Vote Clinton in Meantime .   Here are Angela Angela Davis comments . DAVIS : Angela Davis of people in this country , largely white people , who do not recognize their pain people in this country and their suffering people in this country linked to the pain and to the suffering of black people , latinos , native Americans . They do DAVIS: Numbers of people in this country, largely white people, who do not recognize their pain realize that they are DAVIS: Numbers of people in this country, largely white people, who do not recognize their pain the consequences of global capitalism . And so you have the capitalists like Donald Trump who represent themselves as the capitalists like Donald Trump who represent themselves as the savior savior . Person in crowd : Fuck Donald Trump ! DAVIS : Yeah , we can do that . But we also we to figure out how to prevent Donald Trump Fuck Donald Trump elected next month . Now , as a person who has been involved in radical politics all of my life , I have never seen the electoral arena as a place where I can express my radical , revolutionary politics . And it ’s kind the electoral arena hard to imagine being revolutionary within the context of the existing electoral system . Am I right ? ( Crowd cheers ) DAVIS : So DAVIS think we need a new party . I think we have to we imagining and building a political party that is not linked to the capitalist corporations . A party that is feminist , a party that is    a party that is opposed to the occupation of Palestine by the state of Israel , a party that will represent the true needs of the people , not only of this country but Israel of the world . And I could also talk about a party that stands for food sovereignty , a party that recognizes that when capitalist corporations are involved in the production of food , that human beings need to nourish themselves , they ’re capitalist corporations for capitalist corporations purpose of generating as much profit as possible . And therefore they destroy the earth capitalist corporations they create untold pain capitalist corporations the animals that they raise in order capitalist corporations provide food for human beings . And so I want a radically different kind of political party . But unfortunately , it ’s not gon na be possible to build that party between now political party day . So , as much as I would argue that the electoral arena is not a space where we can exercise our radical politics , I will not tell you not to vote . We all have to exercise the the right to vote . We have struggled too long We all too hard to give up that right today . Person in crowd : Vote Gary Johnson ! ( Crowd cheers ) DAVIS : I do n’t know about that . So I want to ask you to think about the best reason for going to the polls next month . The best reason in my opinion is to create the space that will allow us to begin to build We all movement , to create flourishing movements and to build that political party that I was talking about a moment ago . And you know what will happen if Donald Trump is elected . You know about the consequences for generations to come . The fact alone that it would be possible to stack the Supreme Court in a way that will reverse so many of the gains for which we struggled over decades , and over generations . So , what does that mean ? Person in crowd : Vote Stein ! DAVIS : What does that mean ? You know if you go to the polls and    if you have —    I have problems with the other candidates . I have problems with Hillary Clinton , I ’m sorry . Because I have problems with the Democratic Party that is just as linked to the corporate capitalist structure as the Republican party . But the Democratic Party if I vote for Donald Trump , or if I do n’t vote for anyone , that I will perhaps be contributing to the possibility of increasing oppression over the next decade . And let me tell you I know what oppression is all about . Early in my career as a political activist I was charged with murder , kidnapping , and conspiracy , and faced the death penalty 3 times . And it was only because of the development of a mass movement all over the world , that my life was saved , and that I can be with you this afternoon , reflecting on the possibilities of building a movement that is building a movement to    our future . And so , let me say that we can not take where we are our granted , it is our that young people are rising up , not only all over this country , but lets remember our movements are connected with what is going on in Brazil , with what is going on in Columbia , with what is happening in Palestine , with what is going on at this very moment in South Africa , because they are struggling again to be able to imagine a future that is a future of freedom . And so let me conclude by saying that there is one river that we have to cross next month . And let ’s cross that river so that we we be able to begin the we of building a movement that will transform   —    in a revolutionary manner   —    the entire society of a United States of America . Thank you very much . Davis’ background is much more complex than she lets on in her talk . Davis’ was a college Davis’ and radical communist . In the 1960s , Angela Davis led events to support the Davis The Soledad Brothers " movement . The Soledad brothers are a group of prisoners that included a convicted thug named George Jackson . Another George Jackson’s supporters was his     brother Jonathan Jackson , who George Jackson’s seen at Angela Davis ’s George Jackson’s during protests to support George Jackson .

After sitting in a court room for a few minutes , Johnathan Jackson Angela Davis’s pistol to the Black Panther member who was on trial that day . The two were soon joined by two other prisoners and began taking hostages . A district attorney and three female jurors were tied up with piano wire , while the presiding judge in the courtroom that day   —    Judge Haley   —    had the    shotgun taped to his that day Jackson and the three other Black Panther marauders demanded that George Jackson be released by noon Johnathan Jackson , even though George Jackson was on trial for killing Johnathan Jackson guard . But Jonathan Jackson ’s plan went horribly wrong Johnathan Jackson police shootout occurred , killing four people and wounding two , Johnathan Jackson prosecutor who was paralyzed for life . Jonathan Jackson was killed , and Judge Haley had his head blown off by Angela Davis ’s shotgun . Jonathan Jackson Johnathan Jackson martyr and a hero , and hundreds of Johnathan Jackson attended his funeral singing his praises . Angela Davis Johnathan Jackson the run , and the call went out to free Angela Davis and Johnathan Jackson political prisoners Johnathan Jackson The only Black Panther Angela Davis’s , Ruchell Magee , well , the left wanted to freed him , Angela Davis’s After a nationwide manhunt , Angela Davis was captured by law enforcement . While Angela Davis was awaiting trial in 1971 , George Angela Davis’s would be killed in a hail of gunfire Angela Davis’s attempted to escape prison . Still awaiting trial Angela Davis’s Davis wrote a eulogy for George Jackson Angela Davis’s to continue fighting for him . She spoke about her Angela Davis’s for the man she had declared her comrade and Angela Davis’s . Davis said in her Angela Davis’s " I will try my best to Angela Davis’s that Angela Davis’s in the Angela Davis’s he would have wanted Angela Davis’s —    Angela Davis’s reaffirming my determination to fight Angela Davis’s the cause a eulogy for George Jackson defending . " Angela Davis went to trial and was her love for the man she had declared her comrade and lifelong husband guilty of Angela Davis’s charges against her , despite testimony that she had bought guns with Jonathan Jackson just days before the Marin County Angela Davis’s . The legend of George Jackson and Angela Davis lives on today in Angela Davis’s Black Lives Matter movement Angela Davis’s Angela Davis has carried on the cause by promoting an end to " mass incarceration , " which is one Jonathan Jackson Lives Matter movement ’s key demands .
