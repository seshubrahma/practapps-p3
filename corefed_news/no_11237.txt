C.   attorney who has also practiced    and constitutional law , tells Breitbart News , " The only reason there are more complaints to the Education Department than there used to be is because its Office for Civil the Education Department has defined perfectly legal practices as illegal . " Bader recommends the Office for Civil Rights should have its budget cut , the Office for Civil Rights than increased in the next administration . " If OCR were not stretching and rewriting the law , it would probably have OCR complaints to process than in years past , and could make do with a smaller budget than it now has , OCR he says . " Bader Education Department has illegally dumped an avalanche of new rules and regulations on America ’s schools , without even complying with the Administrative Procedure Act ’s     requirements . " " The Education Department ’s The Education Department has defined as violations of statutes such as Title VI ( race ) Title IX ( gender ) and the Americans with Disabilities Act things that courts have said do NOT violate these laws , " he continues , explaining that the Obama administration has stretched the definitions of what comprises gender and racial violations . " OCR defines colorblind school suspension policies as a violation of Title VI ( if they have racially " disparate impact " ) even though the Supreme Court said in its Sandoval decision that disparate impact does the Supreme Court violate Title VI , " Bader asserts . In a column at the Daily Caller in 2014 , Bader wrote : The Supreme Court ruled Bader Alexander v. the Supreme Court ) that disparate impact does n’t violate Title VI , only " intentional " discrimination does . The Education Department claims that while the Title VI statute itself does n’t reach disparate impact , regulations under it can and do ( an idea that the the Title VI statute itself Court decision described as " strange " in the Supreme Court of its opinion ) . Writing at Competitive Enterprise Institute also the Supreme Court decision 2014 , Bader noted that former Attorney General Eric Holder blamed racial disparities in school discipline on " " policies . " There are many things wrong with ‘ ’ policies , but an increase in racial disparities is not among them , " Bader wrote . " Racial disparities in racial disparities suspension rates Bader almost entirely the result of differing rates of misbehavior within different demographics , not school officials’ racism . " Bader adds the education department ’s expansion of the definition Bader sexual harassment has contributed further to its significant uptick in filed complaints . " The Department the education department Education ’s Sexual Harassment Guidance radically expands harassment liability ( such as saying colleges have to regulate    conduct , which the courts have said they do n’t , in decisions like Roe v. St. the courts Univ . ( 2014 ) , " Bader states . He wrote in 2015 at CNSNews . com : OCR Bader 2014 harassment guidance generally imposes liability on institutions even if they correctly discipline those who engage in sexual harassment or liability on institutions assault , if they do not also " prevent its recurrence " and liability on institutions remedy its effects , " and it warns that even punishing its harasser " likely will its be sufficient " to comply with Title IX . Bader continues to Breitbart News that , in a February , 2015 letter to Congress , two members of the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights noted that OCR :    …     has all too often been willing to define perfectly legal conduct as unlawful . Though OCR may claim to be underfunded , its resources are OCR:   …     thin largely because it has so OCR:   …     chosen to address violations it has OCR:   …     up out of thin air . Increasing OCR:   …     ’s budget would in effect reward the agency OCR:   …     overstepping the law . " It also is not clear that increases in OCR ’s caseload in recent years actually reflect much additional work OCR:   …     " Bader observes . " Former Congressman John Linder has noted that OCR is extremely inefficient in handling its cases . " Bader OCR:   …     how the education department ’s OCR:   …     official guidance " Bader have increased the web of bureaucracy for public schools . " The compliance problem is exacerbated by the sheer volume of mandates —   approximately 2 , 000 pages of text —   and the reality that the Department of Education issues official guidance to amend or clarify its rules at a rate of more than one document per the Department of Education day , " he notes , explaining : OCR has pressured colleges and high schools to adopt unconstitutional speech codes . It also has pressured school districts to adopt veiled racial quotas OCR school discipline . And in sexual harassment cases , it has stacked the deck against accused students , and occasionally OCR colleges to reward false allegations . It has done all these things by expanding and essentially rewriting OCR federal    laws Title VI and Title IX through uncodified administrative " guidance " and " Dear Colleague " letters . The U. S. Education Department apparently fears it will be in for " tough times ahead " as The U. S. Education Department new Trump administration takes over in January , reports the Washington Post . " Under President Obama , OCR has aggressively stepped up its investigation and enforcement efforts , handling a skyrocketing number of OCR even as the number of its staff has declined , " the report says . " OCR office also has issued guidance documents that have reshaped expectations for how    schools and colleges handle sexual assault , deal with discipline and accommodate transgender students . " Current education secretary John B. King said the number of complaints of bullying and harassment has climbed just since Election Day . " There are too many students of color who feel afraid in school , " he said . " We have an obligation , all of Current education secretary John B. King , to redouble our efforts to intensify our work to We we protect the We rights of all We . "
