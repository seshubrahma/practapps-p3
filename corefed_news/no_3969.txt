" There ’s something around globalization that ’s not been working that well . "   " The internet was designed to survive a nuclear war , but even so , I think there are a lot of regulatory challenges that Silicon Valley will be facing from Western Europe and elsewhere in the years ahead , " he continued . " There ’s a technological determinism story you can tell where this is the future and China will eventually buckle under and cave and eventually adopt all of these things . But then you might wonder , maybe this does n’t happen at all , and maybe this ’s possible for The internet to actually fragment and not to have this historical necessity to it The internet " According to CNBC , Thiel added that " No one in their right mind would start an organization with the word ‘ global’ in its an organization today , " before claiming " That ’s so 2005 , it feels so dated . " " A decade ago , this was a group of people who were running the world , and now , it this just a group of people who messed up the the world " concluded Thiel . " I ’m not sure this is a good thing , but it is this fact that maybe politics is becoming more important , it ’s this more intense , the range of outcomes is becoming greater , and that we ’re in a world in which there ’s a bull market in politics that ’s getting started .
