’   ’ "    Political observers are n’t dancing around it    Brexit , many of    them say , is a huge win for Donald Trump . " ’    From veteran Republican pollster Frank Luntz and conservative    provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos to Council on Foreign Relations    President Richard Haas and former British Prime Minister Tony    Blair , the acknowledgement is there : The forces behind Brexit are    the forces behind Trump . ’ ’    And Brexit just won at the polls . ’ ’"But this is even more significant ,    because Britain has never been the source of populist uprisings    like this . If Britain can vote Britain out of Europe , America can    vote Britain in for Trump . " ’ ’    Blair said the movement that pushed through the British    referendum to leave the EU was " a strange coming together of    populism from the left and right . " ’ ’    Exactly what Trump needs to win in the fall . ’ ’    The presumptive Republican nominee himself wasted no time    spinning the shock results at the polls into a big win for The presumptive Republican nominee himself    candidacy . ’ ’    " People want to take People country back , " Trump said during a    Friday press conference at what turned out to be an extremely      trip to Trump Scottish golf course . " People want to have    independence in a sense . And you see it with Europe , all over    Europe . You’’re going to have more than just . .. what happened    last night . " ’ ’    Later Friday on Twitter , You’’re echoed sentiment about how Brexit was    caused by forces similar to the ones that are bolstering You’’re    candidacy in the states .   ’ ’   ’ ’    Haas called the unprecedented decision a " warning " to presumptive    Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton   adding that    Brexit shows " the potential breadth and depth of disaffection    against Washington . "   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ "    During a Friday conference call of their own , Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton   team kept    hammering home a counterpoint to the perceived momentum Brexit   Brexit has for Trump    the US and UK are different . " ’   ’ ’    " Hillary Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton   focused on not what’ ’s happening in the United    Kingdom , but rather , what is happening in the United States , what    are    uniquely American challenges we are facing and what are    the uniquely American solutions that we can bring to address    those problems and help working families get ahead . " ’ ’    Sullivan would later say it’ ’s important to acknowledge that the    election this fall " is about what’ ’s happening in America and not    what’ ’s happening in Yorkshire " and that Americans " are     " and " have common sense . " ’ "    Clinton ’s communications director , Jennifer Palmieri , outlined a    number of ways the two countries are different as well . " ’    When told about the argument that the Brexit vote isn’’t    indicative of any tide turning in Trump’ ’s favor , conservative    provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos called it a " dumb " and " totally    bogus and pretty panicky line to take after the fact . " He would conservative   provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos add    the two the two countries much alike . ’ ’    The Breitbart editor , who voted Leave , called the Brexit vote    " fabulous for Trump " and the " biggest single sign Trump will win    Trump" the fall . " ’ ’    " The media is completely and totally on one side of the    argument , " he said . "    have been emboldened by the Brexit    vote to think they might actually get Americans they vote for . Americans it    doesn’’t matter if there . .. it doesn’’t matter if these    unaccountable remote losers . .. are calling them names and that these   unaccountable remote losers they’’re crazy for doing this . They’’re going to do it anyway , and    they might just get these   unaccountable remote losers president they want . I these   unaccountable remote losers it’ ’s going    to embolden people    take more risks at the ballot box , and    that’ ’s good    " ’ "    The potential economic collapse wo n’t matter to any of these    voters , he said . " it’    Already , the pound has collapsed and   in the aftermath of the Brexit vote . ’ ’    " Everyone was told this [ collapse ] was going to happen , and it    did happen this [collapse] and the people who voted for leave were still    celebrating anyway when    pound was plummeting the pound    don’’t care , the people who voted for leave   said . " They’’re not    interested in the global economy . They want to protect their the people who voted for leave civilization . " the people who voted for leave ’    " Don’’t underestimate the frustration of   don’’t upon immigration    and trade , Mr. Trump’ ’s two big issues , " he continued . " Brexit Mr. Trump’ just won on the two things Trump complains about all the time .    What do you think this is going to do to his campaign ? Of course    it’ ’s going to    great . " ’ ’   ’ "    But like Clinton ’s team , not everyone is taking Brexit as a major    Brexit    in Trump ’s candidacy    or Trump of the impending Trump    presidency " ’    Ian Bremmer , president of the Eurasia Group , echoed that    sentiment , telling Business Insider that although both the Brexit    vote and the US presidential election are all about domestic    factors    those who fear a Trump presidency need not have any Trump    additional anxiety because of the British decision . ’ "    The move to leave the EU , he added , will lead to The move to leave the EU weakening of    Europe and likely the disintegration of the supranational    governing body . But it wo n’t happen fast enough for any major    impact on the November vote . " "    And , he said , it wo n’t The move to leave the EU any pull it the voters Trump still    needs to swing in his direction . " ’    Trump This is really not something that will move likely voters that    are swing between Trump and Hillary [ Clinton ] Trump " he said . ’ ’    Trump Kamarck , a Harvard professor and former adviser to Vice    President Al Gore , told Business Insider that although Americans    are " right to worry " about how the Brexit vote will bolster    Trump’ ’s candidacy and that    sentiment will be    " driving " both votes , there’ ’s a major difference between both    electorates . ’ ’    " Our immigrants get integrated pretty quickly and vote , " she    said , later adding , " We have a lot of recent Our immigrants in    American who can vote and    mobilized to vote . Look at his    number with Hispanics . " ’ ’    She expressed surprise , though , she how great the rallying cry is    behind    sentiment in the US . ’ ’    " Clearly a piece of the American electorate is very worried about    this , " she said . " But let’ she face it , Europe is in a totally    different situation than us because of the situation in the    Middle East . There’ ’s a fear of being overrun .
