Fox Sports 1 " Undisputed "    Shannon Sharpe compared the " different standard " for New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski seen by some NFL players to that of former President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump .   Rob Gronkowski only played eight games in 2016 before Rob Gronkowski had to have    back surgery . The criticism on the tight end comes after Rob Gronkowski participated in WrestleMania 33 and stole quarterback Tom Brady ’s jersey before a Red Sox game this week while recovering from back surgery . According to Sharpe , Gronkowski gets away with more off the field than black stars like New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant , much like Trump has gotten away with more than Obama , although he Trump not offer up any examples . " Think about what was expected of President Obama then look what is tolerated with President Trump " Sharpe said . " Listen , when a white guy does that , that ’s just him , that a white guy Gronk being Gronk , " Sharpe added later Sharpe " Let Odell Beckham do that . Let Cam Newton and Dez Bryant do that . Let ’s take Cam because quarterbacks are judged t0   —    let ’s just take ’s of these guys . Dez Bryant , Odell , Antonio Brown , let them walk around Dez Bryant, Odell, Antonio Brown beers    …      the team would n’t go for it . " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
