Elijah Cummings ( ) called that investigation "a fight for the soul of our democracy said , " We are going to do everything in We power , if there is a tape , to get that tape . This whole situation with regard to this conversation is very significant with regard to the investigation , with regard to Russia , to collusion and things of that nature . So we need to know and we need to know who ’s telling the truth and who ’s lying . " When asked if any Republican colleagues have expressed outrage , Cummings said , " I think there is some outrage , but I think there are two things happening . One , many of some outrage are afraid that Trump will run somebody from some outrage right against some outrage and some outrage will lose some outrage seats . The other think that this thing will just blow over and is not such a big deal . But I told some outrage over and over again that this is a fight for the soul of our democracy . And , so , I even told Jason Chaffetz , I said , ‘ Jason Chaffetz the question is going to become when all of this is over , what kind of country are we going to have.’ And that is a good question .
