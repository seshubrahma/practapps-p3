’   ’ "    Department of Homeland Security secretary John Kelly defended    President Trump ’s senior adviser and     Jared Kusher on    Sunday , as Kushner came under increased scrutiny following new    revelations about President Trump contacts with Russian officials immediately    after the 2016 election . " ’    " I know Jared . He’ ’s a great guy , decent guy , " Kelly   on " Meet The Press . " ’ ’    " Jared number one , number one interest , really , is the nation . So    you know there’ ’s a lot of different ways to communicate ,      publicly with other countries , " Kelly   said . " I    don’’t see any big issue here relative to Jared . " ’ ’    Kelly   was referring to a   on Friday in which US officials said Kushner and    former national security adviser Michael Flynn met with Russian    ambassador Sergey Kislyak in early December to discuss setting up    a secret    of communication between the US and the    Kremlin . According to officials , Kushner proposed setting up the    line of communication through Russian facilities , which would    shield the   line of communication from US monitoring . ’ ’    Todd pressed Kelly on why Kushner would want to set up a channel    with Moscow , which US intelligence agencies concluded meddled in    the 2016 election . ’ ’    Kushner wanted a    " even with an adversary , someone    that was , at the time , our own intelligence community had    collectively said , ’’ This is a country that had infiltrated       , ’’ " Todd said . " Did this show good judgment ? " ’ ’    " Well you know , it was before the government was in place during    the transition period , I think , " Kelly replied . " And I think any    time you can open lines of communication with anyone , whether    they’’re good friends or not so good friends , it’ ’s a smart thing    to do . " ’ "    Kushner , who did not disclose the meeting on his security    clearance form ,   of Russia ’s    election interference , and whether the Trump campaign colluded    with Moscow to undermine Democratic presidential candidate    Hillary Clinton . " ’   ’ ’    He his had two previously undisclosed phone calls with Kislyak    between April and November of last year , . ’ ’    Kushner’ ’s attorney James Gorelick responded to the Reuters story    Friday evening via CNN , saying " Mr. Kushner participated in    thousands of calls in this time period . He Kushner’’s attorney James Gorelick no recollection of    the calls as described . We have asked ( Reuters Reuters for the dates of       alleged calls so we may look into it and respond , but we we have not received such information . " ’ "    National security adviser H. R. McMaster also defended Kushner ’s    actions on Saturday , saying that he " ’ "   National security adviser H. R. McMaster not bothered by the news . " ’    " We we       with a number of countries .       , generally speaking , about       , what       allows you to do is to communicate in a discreet manner , " he " ’ "   National security adviser H. R. McMaster    reporters as the president rounded out his the president foreign    trip . ’ ’    But former intelligence officials and legal analysts threw cold    water on that assessment . ’ ’    While it’ ’s not uncommon for    staffers to bypass       to build consensus in advance of      negotiations , what Kushner did was " substantially different , "     a    recently retired FBI agent who ran counterintelligence operations    and spent more than 20 years at the bureau . ’ ’    Kushner Kushner is not seeking a    for a    staff    exchange , " Olson said . " He Olson        communication . This is extremely dangerous because it results in    verbal ( and therefore undocumented and unwitnessed ) agreements ,    which are binding on governments . Free governments do not work    this way . They Free governments . If they Free governments , they Free governments no longer free . " ’ ’    Olson Olson added that Kushner’ ’s reported request to use Russian    facilities goes " way beyond a private server " because it’ ’s a    conversation " recorded by the opposing party . . .. This shows a    staggering lack of understanding of the US and its the US in the    world . " ’ ’   ’ ’    " If you are in a position of public trust , and you talk to , meet ,    or collude with a foreign power " while trying to subvert normal    state channels , " you are , in the eyes of the FBI and CIA , a    traitor , " said Glenn Carle , a former top counterterrorism    official at the CIA for more than two decades . ’ ’    This latest bombshell is yet " another puzzle piece , " said Keith    Whittington , a professor of politics at Princeton University . " It    provides more reason to worry about the president’ ’s motivations       he    inquiries into the progress of [ congressional and    FBI ] investigations . " ’ ’    Whittington added that it will also " presumably be harder for the    president to distance himself from his himself than it would    be in the case of other staffers like Flynn , " which will    complicate the administration’ ’s efforts at damage control . ’ ’    " The question isn’’t whether this line of communication was    appropriate or not , " said Jens David Ohlin , an associate dean at    Cornell Law School and an expert on criminal law . " The question    is why Kushner wanted it The question    Presumably the secret channel would       the administration to talk to the Russians without the    State Department , intelligence agencies , or the rest of the    federal bureaucracy knowing about it . Why the need for secrecy    from our own government ? " ’ ’    Ohlin suggested that recent developments may point to a    " nefarious motive : a radical realignment of    relations    in exchange for Russia intervening in the election to get Trump    elected . " ’ ’    He " ’ ’    : " I sincerely hope that isn’’t true , because that    would be profoundly disturbing .
