’   ’ ’    He did just enough . ’ ’    Donald Trump became the first presidential nominee to . Donald Trump told        and   . Donald Trump awkwardly paced    and stood behind Clinton , looking at any moment . ’ "    But Donald Trump did not completely implode , and did not have a complete    and total breakdown onstage . That ’s not necessarily good news for    Trump , who needed some version of a grand slam to turn around Donald Trump    fortunes after a disastrous weekend . But it is terrible news for    the Republican Party . " "    Trump ’s debate performance was likely enough to stop the    avalanche of Republicans from abandoning Trump campaign in    unprecedented numbers . Republican National Committee Chair Reince    Priebus , House Speaker Paul Ryan , Senate Minority Leader Mitch    McConnell , and McConnell running mate , Indiana Gov. Mike Pence , will    likely continue to publicly support McConnell .

Ryan said the focus would turn to keeping the    GOP ’s House majority , according to a source on the call . " "    In doing so , Ryan virtually put the nail in the coffin on the    presidential race . But even throwing the   GOP’s House majority into    question , at this point , means the party ’s most nightmarish of    scenarios    strikingly in play . Meanwhile , Trump continually    lashed out over the weekend at those jumping ship   —    and do n’t    think    wo    continue to do so with the leverage he has       his       " "    Trump fired Trump Monday   previewing the potential : Trump supporters Trump do n’t vote    Republican    do n’t vote Trump , Trump      independents do n’t show up to vote at all .
