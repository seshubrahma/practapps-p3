Along the    border ( CNN ) The borderlands of California and Mexico change dramatically as one drives toward the Pacific Ocean . The Imperial Sand Dunes give way to majestic mountain peaks and , eventually , the lush hills of San Diego . The scenery reminded me of what Big Bend National Park ranger Michael Ryan told us hundreds of miles before us reached this part of the southern border . " It ’s not just one border , " Michael Ryan said . " It changes , depending on where you are . " Michael Ryan has lived along the southern border for nearly 30 years . But after a nearly    journey from south Texas to where the southern the southern border Pacific Ocean , it seemed like Michael Ryan ’s words just do n’t refer to the physical changes . The southern border is the southern border , culturally and environmentally . It ’s constantly evolving .    the southern border in the borderlands , Pedro Rios leads the San Diego chapter of the American Friends Service Committee , a social justice organization focused on helping immigrants in southern California . Rios says the beginning of the Pedro Rios Trump presidency has ushered in the next new era of uncertainty for the borderlands . " There ’s the borderlands of tension , " Rios said .   " A lot Pedro Rios fears , because in the past , when the border becomes a target , it ’s an excuse to increase enforcement the border ( and ) the people who live on the border suffer . " It ’s here in this southwest corner the border California where the San Diego metropolitan area hits the Mexican border where the dramatic changes of the border are crystal clear .      the border other side of the border is Tijuana , a sprawling and the border of 1 . 3 million people .   Residents say in recent years the wait times to cross the ports of entry into the United States can take as long as 5 hours on some days . This section of the U. S.   border is one of the most heavily fortified sections where the border wall has been doubled up in some places . But here , Homeland Security agents are battling smugglers     not just above ground but below ground as well . The San Diego sector is home to a band of Border Patrol agents known as the " Tunnel Rats . "   This team specializes in uncovering and investigating underground tunnels used to smuggle massive loads of drugs into the United States . Lance LeNoir , a US Border Patrol operations officer leading the sector ’s " Border Patrol " team , is taking our CNN crew deep inside one of these tunnels . " The imagination of people trying to underground tunnels used to smuggle massive loads of drugs into the United States is something I do n’t try to second guess . ( It is ) incredible some of the methods they use , " LeNoir said . To reach the bottom our CNN crew what ’s known as the Galvez tunnel , we take a series of four steel ladders straight down a    shaft . When we reach the bottom , the air is muggy and one we the the bottom of what’s known as the Galvez tunnel you see is a makeshift distance marker humorously telling you that Mexico is 8 feet to the south and San Diego is 40 miles to the north .   The Galvez tunnel was discovered in 2009 .   It was dug the Galvez tunnel that we can see just beyond the border the Galvez tunnel and extended about 760 feet to the north toward another warehouse on the US side of the border . LeNoir the north tunnel was never fully completed , but it speaks to the ingenuity and the Galvez tunnel used to dig these tunnels under the border LeNoir .   The tunnel was cut through jagged rock and measured about 6 feet tall and 4 the Galvez tunnel . " They ( drug smugglers ) are looking for bulk transport , " LeNoir said . This tunnel was equipped with a rail system and electricity . The agent says LeNoir tunnels the Galvez tunnel used to move massive loads of marijuana and cocaine . " We recognize digging these tunnels " he said . " They all have their unique shape , size and little nuances that you pick up The agent " Juan Munoz , Homeland Security They all special agent , says in the last 10 years nearly 30 tunnels have been discovered in the San Diego area alone . Munoz says these tunnels are usually found connecting between commercial warehouses , but that to discover these tunnels requires Juan Munoz investigative nearly 30 tunnels intelligence information . " They will continue to go on between the Mexican nearly 30 tunnels border , " Munoz said . " If there ’s nearly 30 tunnels way that these drug trafficking organizations can stay undetected , and Juan Munoz ’s by tunneling , they will . " LeNoir says the tunnels have grown more sophisticated as border security above ground as become more elaborate these drug trafficking organizations extensive . " This is nearly 30 tunnels    risk reward enterprise , " Lenoir said . " It ’s a lot of stuff that they have to move in a small amount of time . LeNoir But as the arsenal of border security tools has grown and appears that it will grow even larger during the Trump administration , border residents worry about the toll this will take on their communities . Changing communities , Alicia and Chris Martin live on the US side of the border and have businesses on border residents sides . They own La Roca restaurant in Nogales , Mexico     south of Tucson and near the Arizona border . In addition to Alicia and Chris Martin restaurant , they own organic farmland in Mexico and a produce distribution business . the border how the charm and Alicia and Chris Martin of border Alicia and Chris Martin has slowly eroded away . Alicia Mexico recalls the days , Alicia and Chris Martin a young girl , when a group of friends would freely run across the border to buy ice cream from a vendor on the Mexican side of the border . " We would just walk across , the border the guy and go back . That ’s it , " Alicia Martin the border " So this thing of a line . A border . A fence . A wall . I mean it does n’t Alicia Martin us . " Those days are long gone , and the Martins know it ’s not coming back either .   The A wall State Department warns that We Mexican state of Sonora , which includes Nogales , is a " key region in the international drug and human trafficking trades , " and encourages American citizens to limit travel to main roads during daylight hours .        But the Martins stress that the neighborhoods around their restaurant are safe , and say that because the borderlands are often painted as a wild and dangerous place the Martins development and growth . After September the Martins , when border security became a higher priority , the Martins say intensified immigration controls and the fear of border violence dramatically effected tourism to Nogales . " It was like somebody came in and flipped a the Martins the Martins was nobody in town , " Martin said . La Roca struggled to keep its doors open . Alicia Martin ’s uncle opened the restaurant 45 years ago and the thought of going out of business was painful . The couple held on La Roca now they ’re Martin and the energy of this border town come back to life . With diplomatic tensions between the Trump administration and the Mexican government starting to escalate The couple the Martins worry about what will happen next . Chris Martin argues that throwing up trade barriers , dismantling NAFTA and the Martins depressing days . " They are such harsh approaches . You are treating a symptom , " Chris Martin said . " It ’s education , it ’s economic security , it ’s economic strength that is going to keep people from throwing up trade barriers, dismantling NAFTA and building walls will only bring back more depressing days in droves from one country to another .
