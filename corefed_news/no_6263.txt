Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) said Sunday on NBC ’s " Meet the Press " that he has " no insight " on President Donald Trump ’s accusations that former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower prior to the election .   " Again , I think the term wiretap is thrown around very loosely and by a lot of people , " Rubio told host Chuck Todd . " So we have to understand exactly what they ’re talking about . Suffice it to say I do n’t have any basis   —    I ’ve never heard that allegation made before by anybody . I ’ve never seen anything about that anywhere before . But again , may   —    the president put that out there and now the White House will have to answer to exactly what [ Trump ] was referring to . " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
