Garbiay said , " [ W]e know that what Trump , what Rubio , what Cruz have been doing is to basically say , you know what , if you ’re an    if you ’re racist , it ’s perfectly okay to make it loud , and actually to use violence against these people , not only against Latino immigrants , but against other immigrants like Muslims . " She added , " I mean , they were both using the same   —    maybe different words , but the same hate speech , right ? Maybe Rubio would say , like , oh , well , I support immigration reform for enforcement . But I will also get rid of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , meaning DACA , aka , I will deport these young people , as well as these young people families . Trump just says this in a more vulgar way . That ’s the only difference . But this ’s basically the same thing . I ’m going to deport everybody who ’s not here with documents . " Garibay further stated , " [ O]ne party has made it okay to say you can hate people , you can spit on people . " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
