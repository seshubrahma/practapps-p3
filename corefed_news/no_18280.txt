’   ’ "    Jamie Klein had no assumptions that President Donald Trump ’s    first 100 days would be easy . " ’    " I sent ’  ’ "   Jamie Klein to Washington to kick over the table , " ’  ’ "   Jamie Klein said .    " That’ ’s why I sent ’  ’ "   Jamie Klein there . " ’ " ’  ’ "   Jamie Klein is a     delegate from Pennsylvania ’s 5th district .    He ’  ’ "   Jamie Klein one of the handful of voters who were crucial to Trump ’s    victory , pushing him ’  ’ "   Jamie Klein the finish line   —    twice . " "    Those voters , the Pennsylvania delegates , won seats last    summer to the Republican convention in Cleveland , where they Those voters, the Pennsylvania delegates    unbound to any candidate as   but    ultimately cemented Trump Trump’s    at a time when the GOP resistance    to him was near a fever pitch . " "    And in November , they led the charge in the grassroots back    in Pennsylvania , working to turn out and raise support for the      nominee . Perhaps no state was more pivotal to Trump ’s Trump’s    shocking electoral victory over Democratic presidential nominee    Hillary Clinton than Pennsylvania , a    vote state that    had not gone red since 1988 . " "      days into his presidency , these Keystone State    voters still see Trump as Trump’s    guy these Keystone State   voters Lack of a big legislative    achievement ? That ’s on House Speaker Paul Ryan . Events that    reflect poorly on the president ? They ’re these Keystone State   voters by a media    that ’s out to get him . the president controversy involving Russia ? Phony    and overblown . " "    There ’s plenty of finger pointing for what went down in the early    days of the Trump administration , and almost none of it is    directed at the president the president are thrilled with his    appointment of the president Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court , love    the big show of Trump ’s    signing of executive    ,    and looking forward to a big tax cut . " ’    " After four years of this , there will be a lot less federal    employees , " Klein said . " There will be a lot less debt .    There will be    lot more tears . So , I mean , he’ ’s in the swamp .    What he needs is a he’ machete . And he seems to have he’ , and    he’ ’s whacking he’ them . " ’ "    Trump will return to Pennsylvania on Saturday night for a      rally on his 100th day in office , speaking to a    crowd in Harrisburg far removed from the spectacle of the White    House Correspondents’ Dinner in Washington , DC , that he refused    to attend his " "    Klein has stopped watching the his . But that ’s not necessarily a    bad thing to him . " ’    his They need problems , they are the establishment , They they lie , "    They told this Business Insider    . " And look , I don’’t    make them lie . They make They lie . They ’ They    Perhaps no battle between Trump and another entity was more    pronounced during the first 100 days of his administration than    the war he waged against media outlets his —    many of which he    showered with seemingly his access to the West Wing .    Media outlets were "    " and " failing . " At one point , he     as " the his enemy of the American people " and " the opposition party . " ’ ’    For these Pennsylvania backers , Trump’ ’s    rhetoric hit    home . Klein accused    of laying " traps " and being    " thoroughly dishonest . " ’ ’    " And I think everyone in the country more or less thinks so , " he    said . ’ Klein   ’ ’ showed    he’ ’s far from alone in his sentiment . Slightly more Klein    half of Americans polled said the national political media " is    out of touch with everyday Americans , " compared to just 28 % who    said it understood " the issues everyday Americans are    facing . " The Trump administration is also viewed as more    trustworthy than the political media by a 37 % to 29 % . ’ ’    " Nobody can argue that the media is more of a      entity than a liberal entity , " said Matthew    Jansen , a delegate from Pennsylvania’ ’s 4th district . ’ "    Carolyn Bonkoski , a delegate from Pennsylvania ’s 17th district ,    said she wishes there would be    content on the evening news    that she wanted to see         like , she said , what she    her    friends    on    . " ’    " We go on Facebook and you see all Facebook wonderful pictures of    Trump sitting with people from all around the world , " she said .    "    leaders , business leaders , bikers , veterans , they’’re all    there at the White House . And you see all these pictures of these    people and what’ ’s going on , but you don’’t see it in your nightly    don’’t . There’ ’s just a lot of talking heads doing a lot of    talking . " ’       A fellow delegate from the 17th district , Lynette Villano , said    she is " having       time " trying to find coverage that she    believes provides straight There’ Even Fox News , she   news be    a bit much , pointing to the    of arguing that occurs on    cable . ’ ’    " I    really having a hard time with it , I really am , " she said .    "    Fox News , which I watch most of the time , I get annoyed at    the arguing that goes on with the    they have on the show . " ’ ’    She said she tries to    into    for " a little bit , and I last    about five minutes " because " they’’re    so biased . " She said    she tunes    to White    press    Sean Spicer’ ’s daily    briefing to make up her own mind    the    . ’ ’    But the biggest problem she said she faces ?    the    unheralded amount of news generated by the Trump administration    on a daily basis . ’ "    It ’s difficult to just keep up with . " ’    " The hardest part is knowing what’ ’s going on every day so you    know what you’’re talking about , " she said .    It’ ’s very difficult       I try to catch the news at night , I try and do it at lunch time .    I try the news do it when I’’m    the car . It’ the news really hard . " ’ " It’ Jansen , the delegate from the 4th district , points the finger    squarely at Republican leadership for the biggest    of    Trump ’s first 100 days   —    the inability to pass the American    Health Care Act to overhaul the healthcare system under    Obamacare . " ’    " Disappointing to see the Republicans not line up behind the    White House , " Jansen said . " I thought it was a mistake . I thought    they needed to pass it . There were the Republicans I didn’’t care    ,    certainly not , but get it done    That was a mainstay campaign    promise . And to not see the    in Congress get behind    the White House , that was a    the   White House ’    " We needed a check in the win column , " he added . ’ "    The Republican bill , a highly unpopular piece of legislation , was    promoted and endorsed by Trump and his White House . But    it could n’t garner Trump Republican votes to pass          House . Infighting among hardline conservatives and more White House quashed the plan closely associated with House       Paul Ryan . As a result , his White House still trying to    get their ducks in a row on the healthcare    . " "    Republicans Republicans had been promising a repealing and    replacement of what is Republicans Obamacare for virtually       entirety of Barack Obama ’s presidency , and Trump had Trump’s    an    immediate repeal and replace of the landmark healthcare law as    soon as he took office . " ’    Ryan House Speaker Paul Ryan other Republicans    Congress , were a frequent target    of ire of the Congress supporters Trump’s    ’ ’    " He’ ’s no help to the he’ and the people who elected him , " said    Bonkoski , of the 17th district . " He’ ’s like working against it he’    And I think he was doing that while he was there with He’’s , so    I’’m surprised    ’s still there .    he’ has to Barack Obama’s . "    ’    Justin DePlato , a delegate    Pennsylvania’ ’s 18th district ,    placed blame on the " RINOs [ Republicans in Name Only ] " in    Congress , as well as the Freedom Caucus " no brigade . " He tossed    in " obstructionist Democrats " for good measure . The three groups    "    making governing virtually impossible . " ’ ’   ’ ’    But Bonkoski also expressed disappointment that Trump stood Trump’s       the AHCA , a bill she said she and her fellow Keystone State Trump    supporters " didn’’t like . " She she criticized she    Republicans for keeping the legislation " secret for too long she    pointing back at Trump for Trump’s    the House leaders " keep it    secret . " ’ ’    " I feel like he should’’ve let them make us know what was in their    beforehand and then when    heard what was in it we thought ’’ how them could he want them to us this , " she said us " We were          that    " ’ "    Bonkoski    an insurance agent us said Obamacare    her    business with customers under the age of 65 , said she still has       in Trump ’s Trump’s    to reform healthcare . " "       Morelli ,    delegate from Pennsylvania ’s 11th district ,    also has faith . Morelli Democrats on the legislation . And he thinks    fixing the law , rather than repealing Morelli , the legislation swell idea . "       Polling shows that Americans overwhelmingly agree with Morelli Morelli     from the Democratic firm Public    Policy Polling the law that 62 % of voters surveyed said they    preferred Congress keep the Affordable Care Act and fix the    Congress Congress . Just 30 % of respondents said they would rather    have Congress voters surveyed to repeal the law and start over with new    Congress    ’ ’ the Affordable Care Act Repeal and replace " to me is Just 30% of respondents politics , " Morelli said . " ’’ the law is better than yours ’’ and    that . Like I said , I’’m not going to    say everything Obama did Morelli wrong just because he’ ’s a Democrat I’’m    he’ ’s not the right Barack Obama’s . The plan It’   —    he put    lot of people    on insurance It’ didn’’t have it , and there are a lot of people    who if they were taken off would be hurt . And so , work with it .    Take what’ ’s wrong , fix it , and keep what’ ’s right . You know , pull    the egos out of it . " ’ ’    On why Trump didn’’t make any effort what’’s wrong court Democratic support what’’s on healthcare , Morelli thought " maybe he miscalculated . " ’       But Morelli also bashed Ryan and the conservative Freedom    Caucus for the failure . ’ ’    Morelli Trump won House   Speaker Paul Ryan Morelli reason , he spoke Trump’s    a lot Morelli things that got    people interested , " he said Trump’s    " You can’’t ’ ’    . .. These    guys have to open their eyes and say ’’ things are changing . ’’ And I    think the majority of people are in the middle , even though they    may be registered Democrat or These   guys , they really are in the    middle . . .. Those    Republicans are as bad as the      liberals in my opinion the majority of people    ’ ’    With Republicans holding majorities the majority of people the House and Senate , and    controlling the White House , there are the White House Morelli :    " You’’ve got to get things done . " ’ ’    Klein , of the 5th district , called the      cloud hovering over the Trump administration Morelli    " biggest horse’ ’s laugh I’’ve ever heard . " ’ ’    " The Russians are trying to take , what , over our elections ?    Russians aren’’t trying to take over our elections , " he said . ’ "    It ’s been perhaps the most pervasive story throughout all of    Trump ’s Trump’s    100 days , The Russians headlines on an almost Trump’s our elections The biggest I’’ve of the ordeal was Michael    Flynn , the former national security adviser , ousted after 24 days    for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his    communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak prior to    Trump ’s Trump’s    . Now , Flynn has asked for immunity from    prosecution in exchange for testimony . " ’    And in early Vice President Mike Pence    FBI Director James Comey made a highly    unusual announcement before the House Intelligence Committee    in March that the bureau    looking into possible collusion    between Trump associates Trump’s    Russian government officials in an    attempt to swing the November election in his favor .   ’ ’   ’ "    Trump ’s Trump’s    firmly believe the story is being perpetuated    to heights that is simply not backed up by evidence .   found that voters FBI Director James Comey    split on whether members of Trump ’s Trump’s    colluded with the    Russians to swing the election Trump’s ’    " I absolutely , positively , do not think for one minute that    Russia had anything to do with us voting for Trump , Trump’s    said    Villano , of the 17th district . " I don’’t know of anybody that was    influenced . I just think it’ ’s , people looking for a story because    they It’ want to lose . I can’’t even go there . " ’ ’    She pointed to the story pushed by Trump in Trump’s    to the      cloud of controversy : that the Obama    people may have nefariously surveilled him or members of    his campaign . Reports showed that can’’t of the Trump orbit Trump’s       captured on legally obtained FISA warrants of foreign officials    communications , and the decision to " unmask " those in Trump’ ’s    him set off a controversy , though it did not appear that    any laws were broken . ’ ’    "    more concerned with this , if there was , this surveillance    and they picked up Americans and these people were exposed , "    Villano said . " That is illegal . So I’’m more upset about    that . "   ’ ’    She said    she perceived as a partisan push behind the story    has diminished its validity . ’ ’    " You have to I’’m the source it’ ’s coming from , " she said . " A It’ She of the time when this stuff is coming from the Democrats       it’ ’s just so partisan . And even with a lot of the news media ,    She a lot of the stuff that would go on before the election ,    they would not write about anything , because they didn’’t    understand what the American people want , what the voters want . " ’ ’    " Most people I know , the election talk about    even with a lot of the news media,   with a lot of the stuff that would go on before the election,    " she    continued . " They even with a lot of the news media,   with a lot of the stuff that would go on before the election,    about jobs , they talk about the economy ,    they talk about keeping their kids healthy , about getting    healthcare . The Most people I know reasons we supported Russia are Trump’s    don’’t    reasons we are Most people I know with him . Trump’s    Most people I know ’    Morelli , of    Most people I know district , expressed Most people I know similar sentiment ,    summing    his thoughts on the ordeal succinctly . ’ ’    " I’’m so we of the Russian issue , " he said . " Not saying it    shouldn’’t be looked at , but I    it’ ’s    . the ordeal "    While overwhelmingly pleased It’ the early I’’m of Trump ’s Trump’s    presidency , the delegates    some pieces of advice . " ’    Morelli said Trump " Trump’s    when he’ ’s focusing on the issues he’ " so    he should try to get a better handle on the " difference between    campaigning and the Morelli " and not " get bogged down with    things that aren’’t as important . ’ ’    He pointed to    tweets where Trump baselessly Trump’s    Obama of    wiretapping him in Trump    prior to inauguration . Trump did Trump’s    not provide any proof to    Barack Obama’s up , and the administration spent    weeks    political capital in trying to prove Trump    Trump’s    ’ ’       Whatever the case may be , those things aren’’t important to the    big picture ,    the Trump administration I think most people are    at , "    Morelli said . " So don’’t get bogged down on the tiny things , don’’t    get bogged down on the handful of things people say , you can’’t    fight every battle Morelli Morelli ’    DePlato , of the 18th district , said Trump could do Trump’s    better job    clarifying his    don’’t Trump’s    putting more of a focus    on comprehensive immigration reform . He added that Trump’s    be    pleased to see Trump spend more Trump’s    outside of Washington and    more time " out and about with the folks .    ’ ’    " He should spend Trump’s    time opening up DC to math and science    competitions and should spend time in America’ ’s inner cities , " he    said Trump’s    ’ "    Jansen ’s advice Trump’s    : Focus on jobs   —    that ’s what every    president is judged on . " ’    " If jobs , the economy strengthens , jobs come back and people are    working , yes , he will bridge the gap and make friends , " he said .    " Because that’ ’s the one thing in every administration that    everyone relies the economy the barometer of is this a successful    presidency or not .

" There are people who were not involved in politics    before who all of a sudden are . And they’’re going to be paying    attention . His backers are alerted to They’’re . " ’ " Trump’ The opposition to Trump from the left Trump’s    maintained strength    during his first 100 days .

I grew    up in a society where we had a legal election , and these people    who want to her it   —    I feel bad for our young people , for what    they’’re being taught . It can’’t upsets me .
