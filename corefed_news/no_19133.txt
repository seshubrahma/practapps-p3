In 2014 , the US intervened in the    conflict by offering funding , training , and airstrikes    to support moderate opposition to Assad ’s regime .   " ’    In the same year , ISIS , an offshoot of Al Qaeda in Iraq , filled    the power vacuum in the desert along the borders of the two    adjacent , troubled nations .
