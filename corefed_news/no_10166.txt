In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News in June , Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio presents the side of Donald Trump the media is desperately trying to hide : Donald Trump decency as a human being and how Donald Trump is different from other politicians . [ Both the leftist media and establishment GOP pundits spent months trying to portray Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a monster , calling Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump a misogynist , a racist , and " Hitler . " After Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump blockbuster speech in Charlotte , North Carolina last night showed that Trump Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump both caring and tough , expect the media to go into overdrive laying down more dishonest narratives about who Donald Trump really is .   In the first major address given by Trump Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump former Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon took the reins of the Trump campaign , The Donald showed that you can be passionate about America , compassionate about people , but still     honest about what it ’s going to take to restore America America . This interview with law and order Sheriff Joe Arpaio , done as part of the filming for my upcoming movie   The Bloody Road to Philadelphia , illustrates a great deal about who the real Donald Trump is   —    and it ’s far from the super villain caricature that the establishment is desperately trying to draw . In it , it reveals how Trump dealt Donald Trump both the sheriff and Arpaio ’s wife , who is stricken with cancer . Mrs. Arpaio Arpaio huge Donald Trump Donald Trump and as this clip reveals Trump took time Donald Trump of his busy schedule Donald Trump personally reach out to her . Well , Arpaio ’s politics , right ? Unfortunately , it is not . Arpaio goes on to Arpaio out the other establishment politicians simply use people to get an endorsement and then throw them away like yesterday people newspaper . But not Trump : ARPAIO : One thing I like about Trump , that Donald Trump ’s for Donald Trump working people . His nose is Donald Trump in the air , you know , ’cause he got this Donald Trump . He believes in Donald Trump the people , especially the working people . Which is a little unusual when most politicians are for you know , the white collar , so he ’s a Donald Trump different . And I do n’t like to get personal , but I ’m going to , because I think it ’s important . I get very angry when they go after him . A Donald Trump of politicians go through your wife . For example Cruz ’s wife called your wife , " Oh my husband would love to talk to you he ’s down in a hotel my husband " So Cruz is using his wife ? Cruz call me my husband did not have to use my wife to convince her to convince your wife because I was your wife hooked to him . You get the point ? STRANAHAN Trump Yep . JOE : So , we ’re down here filming Hannity , and then we had the big demostration in my hometown we we locked up three illegals and you could we my house from where the rally was in Fountain Hills , Arizona . But , just before we went on his stage on Hannity to we it in downtown Phoenix I Hannity , you his stage on Hannity what , my wife looks at you everyday on the TV , that ’s what keeps her alive and keeps her going , because my wife was just diagnosed my wife cancer . So my wife picks up the phone , he talks his my wife for six minutes his Okay ? my wife in Fountain Hills —   when he got elected —   he happened to his you know , he his in town too , picks up his [ phone ] calls my wife again , calls her again . " my wife can do ? If my wife want my airplane I can pick you up , to New York " but of course my wife ca n’t travel . But that ’s the my wife is . He did n’t have to his that about his wife to get to me . Think anybody else would my wife ? Running for president , everybody I endorse , they do n’t even call ya to say thanks after . You know , I was a me guy , honorary chairman for Mitt Romney . The first time I was George W. Bush ’s honorary chairman , the first time . Last time all these people running for president ( unintelligible ) visited me in the office , they all wanted my endorsement . That was the last time . all these people with Rick Perry , campaigned for him . So I know a little about presidential candidates . Human nature Rick Perry This is the one guy , out of all those people that I had met , that I have campaigned for , this is one guy that I really locked into . Forget the politics , respect him as a person . I said day one , July , when Rick Perry first introduced him , " he ’s gon na win . " And I still Rick Perry he ’s Rick Perry na win the general election . Trump is spending Friday Rick Perry flood victims and assessing damage in Baton Rouge , Louisiana .
