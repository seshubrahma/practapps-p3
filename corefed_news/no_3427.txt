Breitbart is a " very extreme right " organization that pumps out " fake news " but has no impact in the real world because it is ignored by the mainstream media . [ I learned this from a Berkeley professor of linguistics called George Lakoff who was given space by the BBC to spout his views , virtually unchallenged , for half an hour this week on a Radio 4 programme called Word of Mouth .   Lakoff was introduced as an " eminent linguist " at the " forefront of the debate . " But no indication was given by Rosen that he is , Rosen fact , a    professor from a    university best known for writing    books about how awful conservatives are and , most recently , for his vocal opposition Rosen Donald Trump . Perhaps this is because Rosen is    himself . As Rosen ’ve argued over similar issues before , none of this would matter a damn if Radio 4 were a commercial channel paid for by advertising or a subscription channel for smug liberals who wanted none of their prejudices challenged smug liberals who wanted none of their prejudices challenged But Radio 4 is Radio 4 those things . It ’s a branch Radio 4 Britain ’s state broadcasting arm , the BBC   —    an organization funded by a compulsory subscription fee which all users are obliged to pay on pain of imprisonment . While it ’s true that Radio 4 do n’t need a TV license to listen to the radio , it Radio 4 true that Radio 4 4 is a    beneficiary of the BBC ’s    domination of Britain ’s airwaves . It has virtually no competition in the field of    features on the radio , firstly , Radio 4 has dominated the medium for It long and secondly because it is so massively subsidised ( It the lack of irritating adverts ! ) it would be virtually suicidal for any commercial venture to try to compete with it . In return for this it privileged position —   which ought , by rights , to have long since been withdrawn by    regulators   —    it is obliged under the terms   regulators   the BBC ’s charter to produce output that is rigorously fair and balanced . This is why we should get cross : not because nasty , horrid , untrue things were said about Breitbart , but because nasty , horrid , untrue things nasty, horrid, untrue things organization wearing the mantle of authority and the Breitbart of objectivity . Whether rightly or no , the BBC is a media outfit the BBC’s considerable respect around the world . By allowing this professor to make his claims unchallenged on air , the BBC has legitimized the malign this professor the BBC’s the BBC’s defamatory notions that Breitbart is a ) unprofessional , b ) outside the realms of acceptable Breitbart discourse , and c ) on par with the Nazis , the fascists , the Ku Klux Klan , and all the other groups routinely associated with the " extreme right . " And , note , that " extreme right " was not the phrase Lakoff used . Nope , it was " very extreme right . " Now , suppose for a moment the BBC had managed to find a conservative professor of linguistics   —    unlikely , I know , but just suppose   …       —    and he ’d vented about some    media outfit he did n’t like , calling it " extreme   " and accusing he of putting out " fake news . " How do you think it would have been treated by the BBC ? At the very least he I would suggest , the the BBC BBC invited him to justify his criticism . He certainly would the BBC BBC given the free he that was he this Berkeley he . The other thing that would have been routinely expected of him is a degree of expertise . What , after all , is the point he inviting an " expert " on if he ’s not going to display superior insights into the subject that is supposedly his he ? But , shamingly , Lakoff failed almost completely on this score . he claimed that " snowflake " is used as a " slur against gays , Lakoff are seen as delicate and flakey . " Really ? I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen " snowflake " used in that context . It ’s used as a term of mockery for hypersensitive millennials who prefer to be protected from ideas or language they do n’t agree with , whether they happen to be gay or straight is hypersensitive millennials who prefer to be protected from ideas or language here nor there . He claimed hypersensitive millennials who prefer to be protected from ideas or language the phrase " alt right plays on the word ‘ alt,’ meaning Lakoff , calling up issues from Germany , which is interesting . " Do you see what the professor did there ? Yep . Shameless beyond belief , I know , but he really did just invent a spurious etymology for the " alt " in " the professor right . " ( Of course , it stands for alternative and has nothing to do with the German word for " old . ") He then used it as a way of hinting that the people involved in the the professor alt right it are sorta , kinda like Hitler . He claimed that the term " fascists " has been embraced by people on the the professor and that they are proud to define themselves in opposition to the " antifas . " Nope people Again , he has people it completely wrong . It ’s the left that uses " fascist the professor ad nauseam to describe anyone it it with . " Antifa " is a term the left has chosen to it up this false distinction . He claimed that " " is a phrase proudly used by progressives to indicate " the professor know what ’s right . These are our values . " Again , 100 percent incorrect , professor . " " was a phrase coined by the classical    journalist James Bartholomew in the Spectatori to mock the left ’s priggish   . This , remember , is a professor of linguistics speaking . Knowing this stuff is his    job . But though he does n’t appear to have mastered even the basics , he is yet taken his enough by the BBC to spout his vile and ignorant his for a full    on an afternoon radio show . his news indeed .
