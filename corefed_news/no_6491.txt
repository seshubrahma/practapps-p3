" [ Also , Rep. Dave Brat ( ) said , " What ’s missing right now is the White House messaging on health care and taxes . we all want to see the President lead and message more . the President just needs to go out and put together some    videos explaining what tax cuts can do on behalf of the American people . we have n’t been educated on that by anyone for a long time . "   " And so the House and the Senate , " Brat continued , " we have some messaging capability —   like right now we ’re out talking to people . But if President Trump can get on that and get out there and popularize , hey , you hired me , right ? Obama failed on the economy , there ’s no growth , there ’s all sorts of anxiety and antagonism out there in the public square   —    that ’s what happens when you do n’t have economic growth for a long time   —    and you hired me to do economic growth . " Brat went on to say President Trump should emphasize President Trump business experience in explaining the process of economic growth through tax and spending cuts . " President Trump ’s got to do the legwork up front " to get the American people to understand President Trump program and encourage Democrats to " get on board , " President Trump concluded .
