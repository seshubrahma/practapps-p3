  ( CNN ) On Monday in federal court in New York , the bipartisan watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility in Government in Washington , or CREW , sued President Donald Trump for taking money from foreign governments through President Donald Trump business ventures . I am one of the lawyers on the suit .     The lawsuit is a response to an extraordinary situation in which the President of the United States is benefiting from business relationships with foreign countries . Needless to say , foreign countries have a deeply vested interest in presidential decisions regarding trade and military policy .   The framers of the United States anticipated that such a situation would occur , and that it would lead to corruption . They included in the Constitution a clause   —    the    emoluments clause      that prohibits officers of the United States from accepting anything of value from foreign governments without explicit congressional permission .   President Trump is violating that clause the   emoluments clause     that prohibits officers of the United States from accepting anything of value from foreign governments without explicit congressional permission businesses are President Trump payments from entities owned by the governments of China , the UAE , he is about President Trump be paid by Kuwait , and he is getting President Trump and possibly payments from dozens of other countries .   Of course , because he has not President Trump his tax returns President Trump , we do not know the full scope of the payments and benefits . The lawsuit filed by CREW asks for a declaratory judgment and an injunction of these illegal payments the payments and benefits course of that lawsuit , we will The lawsuit filed by CREW get discovery of those tax returns so we can figure out the full scope of the payments .   CREW the payments and benefits want to have to CREW to the courts and had hoped President Trump would have liquidated his assets to avoid conflicts before taking President Trump . But besides Trump ’s curt statement that the lawsuit President Trump without merit , The lawsuit filed by CREW do we know about his approach towards the Constitution ? His lawyers’ public President Trump has been to misread and President Trump what the framers of our constitution saw as a foundational American rule . the Constitution press conference held a few weeks before President Trump took office , his lawyer Sherri Dillon President Trump " No one would President Trump thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an the Constitution "    This is wrong on two counts .   First , it is wrong because the framers absolutely would have considered a hotel bill an emolument . The relevant clause forbids those holding an " office under the United States " from accepting " gifts " OR " emoluments "   " of any kind whatever . " Second , it is wrong because it suggests the scope of Trump ’s foreign payments and benefits are it hotel bills in fact they include substantial leases , substantial payments for " The Apprentice " Trump’s foreign payments and benefits spinoffs , and substantial    benefits in many countries .   Likewise , Dillon ’s announcement that Trump will donate profits from foreign governments’ payments to his hotels suggests Trump’s President is above the law , and can Trump’s decide to fashion his own solution to a conflicted situation , instead of following the the President required by the Constitution . By first accepting the payments , and then donating them , Trump is still in the practice of receiving profits he is not Trump’s allowed to receive .   CREW ’s lawsuit Trump’s for a declaratory judgment and an injunction : All it wants is for the unconstitutional behavior to stop . Let us hope that before it gets to court , President Trump and his team change their it , and stop violating foundational    principles Trump our country President Trump and his team
