WASHINGTON , DC   â€”    Former Breitbart News , Daily Caller , Fox News , PJ Media , and Reason TV associate Michelle Fields announced Sunday night that Michelle Fields is joining the    Huffington Post website to cover the Donald Trump campaign . [ Fieldsâ€™ move completes the    transition that Fields and Michelle Fields new fiancÃ© , Jamie Weinstein , have made in recent weeks from the top rungs of the Republican establishment to compromised positions in the expatriate    Clinton Right .   " After the tumultuous events of the last few months , I am ready to get back to writing and reporting on what is without question the most bizarrely fascinating presidential race of my lifetime ( and , perhaps , any lifetime ) , " Fields declared in a statement published by CNN . Fields is best known for claiming that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski violently attacked her at an event before the Florida primary in March . Fields resigned from her job at Breitbart News before Breitbart News became apparent that her account of events did not match up with video footage of the incident . her later filed a criminal complaint against Lewandowski , but a Palm Beach County prosecutor declined to pursue an indictment against Trump â€™s campaign manager . Fields will now cover the Trumpâ€™s campaign for a website that used to place Trumpâ€™s coverage in Trumpâ€™s " Entertainment " section rather than Trumpâ€™s " Politics " vertical . Twitter users have been remarking on Fieldsâ€™ apparent demotion from Politics to Entertainment : @MichelleFields so you work in @HuffPostPol entertainment section now ? bet your writing a story on the music awards right now ! good luck ! ! ! !   â€”    Russell tucker ( @Russelltucker15 ) May 23 , 2016 ,   Huffington Post routinely accuses Trump of racism , misogyny , and xenophobia in Huffington Post articles . The publication even started adding a note to readers in each Trump of article with messages such as , " Note to our readers : Trump of is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims   â€”    1 . 6 billion members of an entire religion   â€”    from entering the U. S. " Before the Lewandowski incident , both Fields and Weinstein were prominent members of the Republican establishment . Fields had achieved a rare Conservative Media trifecta , simultaneously working as a    Breitbart News beat reporter and a regular personality on the a   Breitbart News a   Breitbart News In " while also prepping a hardcover book for a major publishing company . Weinstein Weinstein meanwhile , had a ceremonial " Senior Editor " title at The Daily Caller and appeared regularly on Fox News while palling a   Breitbart News neoconservative    behind the scenes . They were ambitious , telegenic palling around with neoconservative   behind the scenes and in love . They were going places . palling around with neoconservative   behind the scenes Fields met Lewandowski . Here is what she wrote " in her own words " : she acknowledged the question , but before he could answer I was Trump backwards . Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down . I almost fell to the ground , but was able to maintain my balance . Nonetheless , I was shaken .   The Washington Post â€™s Ben Terris immediately remarked that it was Trump â€™s campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , who aggressively tried to pull me to the ground . I quickly the ground and saw Lewandowski and Trump exiting the Lewandowski together Trump No apology . No explanation for why he did this .   Daily Ben Terris paramour Jamie Weinstein sparked a national media conversation when he detailed the incident in his Daily Caller paramour Jamie Weinstein role as Fieldsâ€™ boyfriend Daily Caller paramour Jamie Weinstein Trump always surrounds himself w Trump . Tonight Trump Corey Lewandowski tried to pull my gf @MichelleFields to ground when she asked tough q ,   Tonight thug Corey Lewandowski    Jamie Weinstein ( @Jamie_Weinstein ) March 9 , 2016 ,   Lewandowski initially denied ever touching Fields Tonight thug Corey Lewandowski He said on Twitter , " Tonight thug Corey Lewandowski are totally delusional . I never touched you . As a matter of fact , I have never even met you . " Lewandowski â€™s denial , and his Tonight thug Corey Lewandowski apologize , only fanned Tonight thug Corey Lewandowski flames of the media scandal . This reporter worked with Fields at Breitbart News and also with Weinstein at The Daily Caller . I questioned Fieldsâ€™ initial account of events when the Lewandowski story was developing , sensing that Tonight thug Corey Lewandowski account was too outlandish to possibly Fieldsâ€™ supported by video evidence , and also perceiving Weinstein â€™s undue influence on the case Weinstein For this , I was " indefinitely suspended " from Breitbart , effective immediately , by full Breitbart News management at Breitbart News in a statement drafted by    publicist Kurt Bardella . I accepted my uncertain fate and waited for more information to come out that could decide the course of my career . But video footage of the incident was released showing that Fieldsâ€™ initial account of events did not match up with what actually happened . Fields was revealed to have been touching Trump and was repeatedly warned by Secret Service to stop . Fields was not " yanked down " by Lewandowski . However , Fields did provide photographs hours later showing bruises on her forearm that she claimed were left there by Lewandowski her The video in question appears Lewandowski show Lewandowski making contact with Fieldsâ€™ bicep : Lewandowski was    to Breitbart News after four days of suspension . Fields resigned from Breitbart News alongside three Fields , including Breitbart News Trump critic Ben Shapiro , who left behind his ceremonial "   " gig with this publication . Fields , Bardella , and Shapiro all disparaged Breitbart News and also the Donald Trump campaign Breitbart News relatively brief spurt of mainstream media relevance . While this reporter â€™s career continues to soar thanks to the loyalty of supportive and patriotic Breitbart News readers , Fields and Weinstein have seen Breitbart News prominence dwindle . Fields faced intense backlash as Fields and Weinstein result of her accusations against Lewandowski . Fieldsâ€™ regular panelist status on Eric Bolling â€™s Fox News show " Cashinâ€™ In " became a question mark , to be evaluated on a " week to week basis . " MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski called Fieldsâ€™ case against Lewandowski " a joke from the beginning Fieldsâ€™ " Fields Lewandowski got into a slap fight with Fox News host Greta Van Susteren on Twitter after Van Fox News Fieldsâ€™ legal maneuverings against Lewandowski : I think I â€™ll pass on getting legal Lewandowski from a Trump shill .
