  ( CNN ) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos sharply criticized opponents of school choice on Monday , calling them " flat Earthers " who have " chilled creativity " and held American students back .   Education Secretary Betsy DeVos provided no details of the administration ’s plans to promote school choice , an expansive term that includes expanding access to and promoting    education options , like charter schools or voucher systems . But Education Secretary Betsy DeVos did say states that resist school choice innovations would be making a " terrible mistake . " " states that resist school choice innovations will be hurting the children and families who can least afford it . If politicians in a state block education choice , it means those politicians do not support equal opportunity for all kids , " DeVos said .   DeVos told attendees at a    choice conference in Indianapolis that it is important to provide not only options in education , but also " the widest number of quality options . "   " If a menu is full of bad options , then do you really have a choice at all ? " DeVos said .   After being appointed by President Donald Trump to take over the Education Department earlier this year , DeVos has spoken only in general terms about how the Trump administration plans to pursue school choice . But DeVos has indicated the federal government will leave many of the details to individual states     and the Trump administration ’s budget is expected to allow states to use some federal grant money for school choice initiatives .   " We all fundamentally know one size does n’t fit all     and that we We all n’t accomplish our We all by creating a new federal bureaucracy or by bribing states with their own taxpayers’ money , " DeVos said Monday . " We should have zero interest in substituting the current    approach for our We ( new )    approach . "   DeVos DeVos scheduled to testify before Congress on the administration ’s education budget later this week .
