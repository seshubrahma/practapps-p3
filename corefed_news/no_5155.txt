Update : A representative for Pepsi provided the following statement to Breitbart News late Tuesday night : " This is a global ad that reflects people from different walks of life coming together in a spirit of harmony , and we think that ‚Äôs an important message to convey . " [ Original story below :     Kendall Jenner and soda giant Pepsi came under harsh criticism on social media Tuesday for a new commercial that appears to use the backdrop of    protests to hawk more soda . In the nearly    ad   ‚Äî    titled " Live for Now Moments Anthem "   ‚Äî    Kendall Jenner is pictured on a modeling shoot in New York City when a sizable crowd of protesters streams past holding signs and demonstrating in the streets . Soon ,   Jenner takes off   Jenner blonde wig and joins the protesters , who appear to be styled after    Trump " resistance " demonstrators . The model steps through the crowd holding a can of Pepsi , which   Jenner then hands to one of the police officers watching the protest the officer accepts the can , to the loud cheers of everyone in the streets .   The spurred a widespread backlash online , particularly among progressives and social justice activists , with hundreds of social media users weighing in with mostly negative feedback as " Pepsi " began trending on Twitter Tuesday afternoon . Some critics took aim at the ad ‚Äôs apparent suggestion that sharing a soda with a police officer could end racial discrimination , while others   ‚Äî    including comedian Patton Oswalt   ‚Äî    joked about the soda ‚Äôs mythical    qualities . Below is a sampling of social media reaction to the ad‚Äôs . A representative for Pepsi did not immediately return a request for comment .
