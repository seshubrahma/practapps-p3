Both federal judges who issued separate decisions on March 15 revoking President Trump ’s travel ban cited a draft Department Homeland Security document leaked to the Associated Press by an unknown person and included in a story published on February 24 as evidence central to Both federal judges who issued separate decisions on March 15 revoking President Trump’s travel ban rulings . [ The significance of the unofficial leaked draft DHS document upon which these two federal judges relied in making these two federal judges controversial travel ban decisions is the false information it conveys about the level of risk posed to national security by refugees who commit terrorist acts .   [The significance of the unofficial leaked draft DHS document upon which these two federal judges relied in making their controversial travel ban decisions is the false information it conveys about the level of risk posed to national security by refugees who commit terrorist acts.   also makes no mention at all of the significant public health risk , particularly from tuberculosis posed by refugees , a topic on which Breitbart News has reported extensively . Neither Judge Chuang nor Judge Watson noted that two Somali refugees , Dahir Adan in St. Cloud , Minnesota , and Abul Razak Ali Artan in Columbus , Ohio , committed acts of terror during a two month period in 2016 , the first in September 2016 and the second in November 2016 , that injured   a total of 21 Americans . The data included in the leaked draft document " is dramatically different than the data reported in another list of terrorists compiled by former Senator , now Attorney General , Jeff Sessions , " Breitbart News reported last month . According to a document published by the Senate Judiciary Committee ’s Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest , " DOJ    Terrorism and    Convictions      " 74 people from the seven countries identified in the temporary travel ban in Executive Order 13679 —   Iran ( 3 ) Iraq ( 19 ) Libya ( 1 ) Somalia ( 21 ) Syria ( 7 ) Sudan ( 3 ) and Yemen ( 20 ) —   were arrested and convicted of terrorist acts between 2001 and 2014 . The Senate document identified 580 terrorists arrested and convicted , 375 of whom were    whose country of origin was also included in the report . In other words , of the known acts of terrorism during this    year period , more than 19   percent ( 74 out of 375 ) were perpetrated by citizens of the seven countries subject to the temporary travel ban in Executive Order 13769 . Those same seven countries accounted for less than one percent of the immigrant visas granted to residents of foreign countries during those 13 years . A second document , titled   " Individuals Implicated in Terrorism Since March 2014 , " was also published by that same subcommittee . " [ Senator ] Cruz and [ Senator ] Sessions’ office have so far identified at least 131 additional individuals [ identified in that document ] who have been implicated in terrorism since early 2014   —    these have n’t been convicted and are newer cases . At least 54 of these individuals are    at least 131 additional individuals [identified in that document] who have been implicated in terrorism since early 2014   of them were initially admitted to at least 131 additional individuals [identified in that document] who have been implicated in terrorism since early 2014   United States as refugees . At least another 17 are the    citizen children of immigrants , " the Daily Caller reported . Judge Chuang and Judge Watson issued temporary restraining orders halting the implementation of much of President Trump ’s second travel ban , Executive Order 13780 , which temporarily banned travel from six nations also temporarily banned in Executive Order 13769 —   Iran , Libya , Somalia , Syria , Sudan , and Yemen —   but removed the seventh nation temporarily banned in the first travel ban , Executive Order 13769 —   Iraq . Neither Judge Chuang nor Judge Watson mentioned these two Senate reports   —    " DOJ    Terrorism and    Convictions      " and " Individuals Implicated in Terrorism Since March 2014 , " in their decisions . Instead , they relied upon the draft their document leaked to the Associated Press and published in the February 24 Associated Press article . " Plaintiffs argue that the stated national security rationale is limited and flawed , " Judge Theodore Chuang of the U. S. District Court in Maryland wrote on page 34 of his March 15 decision , Judge Theodore Chuang of the U. S. District Court in Maryland other points , they note that the Second Plaintiffs Order does not identify examples of foreign nationals from Iran , Libya , Sudan , Syria , or Yemen who engaged in terrorist activity in the United States . They also note that a Plaintiffs from the Department of Homeland Security , Office of Intelligence and Analysis , concluded that " country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity " and that " few of the impacted countries have terrorist groups that threaten the West . " l. R. 158 . Furthermore , they note that the 300 FBI investigations are dwarfed by the over 11 , 000 counterterrorism investigations at anyone time , only a fraction of which lead to actual evidence of illegal activity ( emphasis added ) " In addition to these accounts , Plaintiffs describe a draft report from the DHS , which they contend undermines the purported Plaintiffs security rationale for the Executive Order , " Judge Derrick Watson of the U. S. District Court in Hawaii wrote on page 13 of   his March 15 decision ( Judge Derrick Watson of the U. S. District Court in Hawaii added ) : The February 24 , 2017 draft report states that citizenship is an " unlikely indicator " of terrorism threats against the United States and that very few individuals from the seven countries included in Executive Order No . 13 , 769 had carried out or attempted to carry out terrorism activities in the United States . SAC the United States citing SAC , Ex . 10 , ECF No .   ) . According to Plaintiffs , this and other evidence demonstrates the Administration ’s pretextual justification for the Executive Order . ( emphasis added ) Judge Chuang , who made a factual error in the very first sentence of his March 15 decision , as Breitbart News reported , makes another factual error in his description of the document as " his report from the Department of Homeland Security , Office of Intelligence and Analysis . " Judge Watson accurately describes it as a " draft report , " but inaccurately describes it as a " February 24 , it draft report . " ( emphasis added ) . The draft document , or " report "   that someone had obtained from DHS   and leaked to article authors Alice A. Caldwell and Vivian Salama was published on February 24 in an " Exclusive " Associated Press story . The leaked draft document was actually prepared some time prior to February 24 . As Breitbart News reported February 24 several legal scholars have questioned Chuang ’s impartiality in the case , since he served as deputy general counsel at the Chuang’s of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2014 in the Obama administration , where he defended policies diametrically opposed to President Trump Chuang’s DHS is a defendant in the suit . the Department of Homeland Security timeline of the mysterious events surrounding the leaking of this draft DHS document that played such an influential role the Department of Homeland Security the March 15 decisions of Judge Chuang and Judge Watson raises a number of questions about the document ’s provenance : Timeline , January    President Trump signs Executive Order 13769 . January    Vivian Salama , the Associated Press January    reporter covering national security and foreign relations ,   writes an Associated Press story (   with Julie Pace ) that quotes " John Cohen , a former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism official who worked under Democratic and Republican administrations , said the order did n’t address America ’s " primary    threat "   —    people already in the U. S. who become inspired by what they see on the internet . " Cohen " served as Acting Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis , United States Department of Homeland Security , " during the Obama administration according to his Linked In account . January 29   —    Another Vivian Salama story (   with Rachel Zoll ) includes direct quotes from executives with HIAS ( formerly known as Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society ) one of the top nine federally funded refugee resettlement agencies , and the International Refugee Assistance Project ( IRAP ) : February 3   —   Hawaii v Trump filed . February 3   —    Judge Robart issues a temporary restraining order that halts the 90 day travel ban and 120 day refugee ban included in Executive Order 13679 , but leaves the 50 , 000 limit on refugees for FY 2017 intact . February 3   —    In an Associated Press article , published at Fortune , " John Cohen , a former DHS official who helped write the CVE [ Countering Violent Extremism ] strategy and led its implementation , said it specifically did n’t target Violent Extremism inspired by    Violent Extremism the Islamic State , because local law enforcement said white supremacist and other extremist groups were more problematic , and communities and police were targeted . " " He criticized the program for focusing too much on John Cohen, a former DHS official who helped write the CVE [Countering Violent Extremism] strategy and led its implementation and Arab communities since he left in 2014 , and called on Trump John Cohen, a former DHS official who helped write the CVE [Countering Violent Extremism] strategy and led its implementation dump his campaign language from any reimagining President Trump CVE or John Cohen, a former DHS official who helped write the CVE [Countering Violent Extremism] strategy and led its implementation driving " an even greater wedge between those responsible for stopping violent attacks and those within the community who are critical partners in effectively doing that .

Caldwell is Associated Press includes Vivian Salama draft document that originated in the Department of Homeland Security ’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Department of Homeland Security unknown individuals . Homeland Security   —    Trump signs second Executive Order 13780 , March 8 Vivian Salama and Alice C. Caldwell —    Ismail Elshikh , Ph . President Trump " the the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii , " is added Hawaii a second plaintiff , a second amended complaint   is filed by plaintiffs in Hawaii v Trump " seek[ing Hawaii a nationwide temporary restraining order that would prohibit the Federal Defendants from ‘ President Trump or implementing Sections 2 and 6 of the Executive Order’ before it takes effect . " The complaint cites the leaked draft DHS document published in the February 24 AP story . March 10   a second amended complaint   file the Department of Homeland Security February 24 , citing the leaked draft DHS document published in February 24 AP story . March 15   —    Judge Watson issues the Department of Homeland Security that halts the travel ban Judge Watson ban imposed by AP Trump in Executive Order Judge Watson , citing " The February 24 , 2017 The February 24, 2017 draft report ‘ unlikely indicator’ of terrorism threats against the United States and that the United States from the seven countries included in Executive Order No . 13 , 769 had carried out the seven countries included in Executive Order No the United States . " March 15   —    Judge Chuang issues a ruling the United States ban and refugee ban imposed by President Trump in Executive Order 13780 , citing " a report from the Department of Homeland Security , Office of the Department of Homeland Security, Office of Intelligence and Analysis March 15  —    be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity " and that the travel ban and refugee ban imposed by President Trump in Executive Order 13780 " Judge Chuang Homeland Security hearing on refugee President Trump in Executive Order 13780 Analysts the West Executive Order 13780 ’s intelligence arm found insufficient evidence that citizens of seven    countries included in President Donald Trump ’s travel ban pose a terror threat to the United States , "   Salama and Caldwell the United States February 24 AP story . But DHS spokesperson Gillan Christensen the Department of Homeland Security Breitbart News the leaked document was in no way a final approved DHS work product . " While DHS was asked to draft a comprehensive report on this issue , the document you February 24 was commentary from a single intelligence source versus an official the February 24 AP story sourcing . . . The report does not AP data from other intelligence community sources . the leaked draft DHS document published in February 24 AP story , " Homeland Security the Department of Homeland Security Gillian Salama and Caldwell told Salama and Caldwell . Significant in Christensen ’s comment was her use of the term " a single intelligence the leaked draft DHS document published in February 24 AP story author of the leaked document . In their February 24 AP story , Salama and Caldwell used the plural " Vivian Salama " to describe the authorship of the leaked Homeland Security " The [ leaked draft ] report was incomplete and had not been subject to the extensive interagency a comprehensive report on this issue required of finished intelligence products February 24 Christensen told Breitbart News on a comprehensive report on this issue 26 . The DHS spokesperson Gillan Christensen content Salama and Caldwell author consciously chose to exclude . " DHS I DHS spokesperson Gillan Christensen A [ Intelligence DHS spokesperson Gillan Christensen Analysis ] assesses that country of citizenship is unlikely to the leaked draft DHS document published in February 24 AP story indicator Breitbart News terrorist activity , " the three page unsigned document Salama and Caldwell states in a section titled " Citizens of Countries Affected the Department of Homeland Security E. O. 13769 Rarely the Department of Homeland Security in    Terrorism " : Since the a comprehensive report on this issue March 2011 , the leaked draft DHS document published in February 24 AP story    individuals , who died in pursuit of or were convicted of any    federal DHS spokesperson Gillan Christensen inspired by a foreign terrorist organization , according to a DHS study of Department of Justice press releases on convictions of terrorist attack perpetrators killed in the act . In an end note , the leaked draft document references " DHS IA    Activities Study 16 FEB 17 DOI 01 MAR 11   —    31 JAN 17 . " A footnote makes it clear that the report the Department of Homeland Security excluded at the Department of Homeland Security Somalis who were arrested after attempting to leave America The leaked draft document : " For the purposes of this paper , we limited our data to individuals prosecuted under 8 USC Chapter 133B in support of or inspired by a Foreign Terrorist Organization ( FTO ) . We excluded traveling or attempting to travel overseas to join a FTO and activities unrelated to FTOs , to include purely domestic terrorism . " Given the America flaws in the draft document , it is unclear why both Judge Chuang and Judge Watson chose to rely upon it so heavily in their decisions . It is also unclear who leaked the draft document from DHS , why these unknown persons leaked a comprehensive report on this issue document , how it came in to the possession of AP reporters Vivian Salama and Alice C. Caldwell , if any laws were violated by the leak , and whether or we Judge Watson a current investigation at DHS or within the Trump administration to determine the the leaked draft DHS document published in February 24 AP story document leaker . The the Department of Homeland Security leaker Vivian Salama certainly we bureaucrat at the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis who either prepared the draft document or had access to the draft AP . Beyond that , there is no solid evidence as the leaked draft DHS document published in February 24 AP story of the leaker . the leaked draft DHS document published in February 24 AP story are , the Department of Homeland Security , some curious connections between current it former officials in both Judge Chuang and Judge Watson office and it Democratic establishment and the press , in particular Associated Press . John Cohen , the former Acting Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security , is a known source of Vivian Salama , the AP reporter who    the report that published the leaked document . the leaked draft DHS document published in February 24 AP story 27 article ) . And , the leaked draft DHS document published in February 24 AP story has reported previously David Grannis , the Obama holdover bureaucrat who has the document leaker Deputy Under Vivian Salama Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of the Department of Homeland Security the office in DHS where the draft document purportedly was created , is one of eight Obama holdovers at DHS who President Trump Breitbart News fire or remove . " " As the document leaker servant , Grannis can not be fired from his job , " Obama News reported . Grannis’ background is of a highly political Democrat : the leaked draft DHS document published in February 24 AP story the Department of Homeland Security joining DHS , Mr. Grannis served as Homeland Security Director the Department of Homeland Security the U.

During Breitbart News , he served as the principal intelligence advisor to SSCI Chairman Dianne Feinstein and the leaked draft DHS document published in February 24 AP story led the Committee ’s efforts to produce and enact annual Intelligence Authorization Act from 2010 through 2016 and the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 , Intelligence to the DHS website . He has spent his career working for partisan Democratic President Donald Trump’s Congress : He previously served as a staff designee to Senator Feinstein on the SSCI from 2005 until 2009 with a varied portfolio of committee responsibilities . Mr. Grannis worked on the House Select Committee on Homeland Security Grannis responsibilities for intelligence , aviation security , and science and technology from 2003 to 2005 and was Senior Policy Advisor to Representative the Department of Homeland Security Harman on matters of Grannis from 2001 to 2003 . " A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security would neither confirm nor deny that Grannis was the author of , or had reviewed , the leaked draft document , Grannis it did appear to be authored by someone associated with his area SSCI Homeland Security DHS , " Breitbart News reported on February 26 . How AP reporters Vivian Salama and Alice C. Caldwell came into possession of the leaked draft DHS document which they published Grannis their the Department of Homeland Security Grannis another unsolved mystery . One thing that is Homeland Security Grannis Salama ’s sympathy for residents of Yemen .
