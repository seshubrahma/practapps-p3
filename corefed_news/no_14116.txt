  ( CNN ) You ’ve got to give Donald Trump points for consistent audacity . When you lie , distort , and make God an accomplice while speaking to the Central Intelligence Agency     where facts are the coin of the realm     you must have absolute confidence in your abilities .    In the first days of Donald Trump presidency , Donald Trump has shown Donald Trump will continue to wreak havoc on established facts , even as Donald Trump ticks items off Donald Trump political    list .   On Monday , Donald Trump repeated a false claim that millions of illegal ballots cast by undocumented immigrants deprived Donald Trump of winning the popular vote in November . The latest false claim , which legislators reported to CNN and other news outlets , has no basis in fact and apparently originated on websites that peddle conspiracy theories . However , like many of the distortions in which Trump has trafficked , the voter fraud narrative suggests Trump deserves more credit and acclaim than Trump has received . Throughout Trump life Trump has insisted Trump is richer than people acknowledge . Now winning the presidency is n’t sufficient . Trump wants the final score to be adjusted in Trump favor .               Trump ’s complaints and distortions suggest that even as Trump carries out Trump duties as President , Trump will reflexively promote Trump alternative view of reality . The day after Trump inaugural address , Trump in a speech to the CIA     denied ample photographic evidence , insisting that his Trump in was in fact attended by a crowd that " looked like a million , a million and a half people . "    He Trump recruited the Almighty to aid the lie , saying heaven had stopped the rain from falling when he Trump     " and then it became really sunny . " It rained throughout . Coming on his Trump full day in office , Trump ’s    talk was delivered as he Trump before the Wall of Stars that memorializes CIA agents killed in action .   It ’s hard to imagine that anyone could occupy this spot and speak with so little regard for accuracy and truth . However , this is Donald Trump and he did Trump get where he is Trump exercising care , precision and restraint . Donald Trump Trump public figure in New York by promoting himself as a Trump real estate mogul     before he ’d built Trump single project . That first project depended on a lie told to the City of New York , New York form of an unsigned document , and a    claim made to recruit Hyatt hotels as a partner . It worked .   That first project depended on a lie told to the City of New York, in the form of an unsigned document, and a   claim made to recruit Hyatt hotels as a partner followed was a lifetime of little and big falsehoods , some of which involved adopting false identities . Most involved what Trump calls " truthful hyperbole . " This category would include such items as his claim that he Trump he was Trump to Trump aboard a helicopter that crashed , that his wealth was far Trump than reported , and that he owned the Empire Trump Building . When caught in his deceptions , Trump Trump generally gone Trump the attack against those who fact check his claims . In Trump Empire State Building episode , he did n’t defend Trump , but instead Trump on the offensive , calling the British TV reporter Selina Scott a "   journalist . "    Indeed , throughout his life , Trump Trump deflected criticism Trump attacks on the press . He made this theme Trump major element of his election campaign , Trump journalists " slime " " dishonest " and " disgusting . " He repeated the charge Trump the CIA last weekend .     Although political craft often includes    facts and battles with straw men , Trump far exceeds the norm and has confounded analysts and pundits who try to assess him .   During Trump campaign , which Trump many specious claims about his opponents , much Trump written and said about how he might " pivot Trump to show he could be presidential Trump This change never happened and , now that he holds the office Trump he seems equally disinclined Trump Understanding why requires acknowledging both the man ’s record Trump that are engaged when people lie and get away with it .     Knowing that character is destiny , parents teach their children to tell the truth parents but invariably preschoolers discover that honesty is n’t always required . Few things are more thrilling in the life of a kindergartner than a whopper that    find amusing . Later kids discover how to tell more sophisticated lies that are more likely to go undiscovered , and they realize that everyone is capable kids practicing deception . Adolescent adjustment requires that we come to grips with the fact that lying is part of human nature . People tend to rank deceptions according to the harm they cause , or , in People cases , the greater good they may achieve . Economists and People social scientists have documented the prevalence of lying and shown that people feel more comfortable lying if they think their deceit will help people worthy people Fortunately , people who habitually tell really big lies are rare . Neuroscience shows that among frequent deceivers , the discomfort people feel usually when they lie recedes . When researcher the discomfort people Sharot of University College London discussed this with a writer for New York magazine she said : " After a researcher Tali Sharot of University College London , the negative value of lying     the negative feeling     is just not there , so much . " Of course most of us want to be considered trustworthy and we know that all relationships , us the personal to the political , depend on reliable truth telling . The exceptions are those who discover they can get away with distortions The exceptions and even profit from them . Those capable of the The exceptions sophisticated deceptions are bold , brazen , and may even enlist others in support of the process .   History is replete with examples of lies , told and agreed to , with scandalous results . The crime and coverup that doomed Richard Nixon ’s presidency was a florid display of the danger in deception . The collapse of      companies     including Enron and Worldcom     came when systemic lies unraveled . In Trump ’s life before politics we can see smaller examples , including his insistence that his public relations Trump claim that Trump for his TV show " The Apprentice his public relations man were higher than the facts showed . During the election he accumulated an abysmal record when his public relations man came to truthfulness . The the election Politifact . com reported that only 16 percent of hundreds of Trump statements it reviewed were better than " The nonpartisan Politifact true . " Although he was called out on this his public relations man , he continued doing it to the his public relations man of the he was called out on this practice and beyond . In the process , he enlisted his campaign apparatus in his public relations man of his public relations man he said at his rallies , his public relations man interviews , his public relations man at debates . After the election , prominent Trump supporter Scottie Nell Hughes told public radio talk show host Diane Rhem " there ’s no such thing , unfortunately , anymore as facts . " Amid the controversy over Trump ’s statement at the CIA Trump press secretary Sean Spicer used his first appearance before the White House his press secretary Sean Spicer corps to support the boss ’s claims with a lecture riddled with inaccuracies about the inauguration . ( He even offered inflated numbers for the his press secretary Sean Spicer transit system ’s ridership . )    Next , Kellyanne Conway explained that as Trump contradicts evidence available to all he was simply offering " alternative facts Kellyanne Conway . Conway ’s reference to alternative facts , Kellyanne Conway ’s strange Saturday rant , provoked pointed criticism of the sort that would trouble someone unaccustomed to    combat against the facts . When he next met with reporters , whom he Kellyanne Conway deal with on a regular basis Kellyanne Conway Spicer tried to make them understand him     Spicer a way that whom he must deal never Kellyanne Conway . He said : " The default narrative [ Kellyanne Conway the press ] is always negative , and that ’s demoralizing . It ’s a little demoralizing because when you are sitting there and you are looking out and you are in awe of just how awesome that view is and how many people are there and you turn on the television and you see shots comparing this and that . " It is easy to empathize with Spicer ’s experience , but if he is demoralized it ’s mainly because he Spicer part of a team led by Spicer man who has never been satisfied with his real achievements . When you demand that Spicer reject what they know to be true in favor of others gilded vision that favors your side , you are bound to receive a demoralizing response .
