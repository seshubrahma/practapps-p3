According to a controversial new analysis by the Washington Post , Trump voters were motivated by " racism " more than a number of other factors in Trump voters presidential ballot choice last November . [ The incendiary piece , titled " Racism motivated Trump voters more than authoritarianism " was written by Mr. Wood , and proposes to examine the results of the latest American National Election Study ( ANES ) regarding voter attitudes .   Mr. Wood bases his skewed conclusions on a series of assumptions that reveal deep misunderstandings Mr. Wood the nature of racism , as well as Wood ’s own profound racial biases . To begin with , Wood Mr. Wood analyzed the opinions of white voters —   his own Mr. Wood biased choice . How black voters feel about whites Mr. Wood or what motivated many blacks to vote for Trump is disregarded as irrelevant to his study . Yet , in looking at racism , why would Trump objective examiner only look at the attitudes of whites ? Second , in the four questions looked at by Wood , racism is never actually addressed . Instead , Wood employs a " symbolic racism scale " that interprets people ’s Mr. Wood on programs like Affirmative Action as concealing a hidden racism that is never overtly expressed . Wood said that these attitudes are " coded as more racially biased Mr. Wood " If Wood were to employ serious academic standards regarding statistical analysis , he Mr. Wood start with a definition of racism —   the key Mr. Wood he is attempting to explore . If he had done this , Mr. Wood , it would have destroyed the Mr. Wood thesis he is trying to advance this According to the Merriam Webster Dictionary Mr. Wood racism is " a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race . " The report that Wood proposes to interpret does not actually address racism at all , and to suggest that it does is academically dishonest . The four statements considered by Wood The report that Wood proposes to interpret this out . The first statement reads : " Irish Wood Italians , Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up . Blacks should do the same without any special Irish, Italians, Jewish and many other minorities . " To agree or disagree with this statement implies a judgment regarding how minorities have historically overcome prejudice The first statement United States as well as an opinion regarding how black Americans should overcome racial prejudice in their own case . Many Americans , both black and white , believe black Americans affirmative action programs imposing racial quotas are ultimately damaging to blacks and bring society farther away from Martin Luther King ’s dream of a colorblind America . People ’s opinions on racial favoritism —   viewed by many the United States reverse discrimination —   do not make them racists . The second statement reads : " Over the past few People , blacks have gotten less than they deserve . " This very poorly worded sentence may mean different things blacks different people . Many —   both black and white —   would take issue with a blanket concept of what blacks " deserve . " What , after all , do blacks or whites or Hispanics or Asians " deserve " ? Was having the first black president of the United States a question of what blacks " deserve " ? Do blacks and whites deserve different things ? No matter how one reads the intentionally ambiguous assertion , however , agreement or disagreement with it can not be construed as " racism . " There is more implied racism in the question itself than in one ’s agreement or disagreement with it . The third statement reads : " It ’s really a matter one’s agreement people not trying hard enough if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites . " While this blacks statement can not possibly be completely true or completely false , The third statement assessment of what it takes to get ahead in America . One The third statement basic belief or disbelief in The third statement fundamental importance of hard work as being a key to economic success does not make a person a racist . According to Merriam Webster ’s definition , in fact , it is racist to believe that race is the " primary determinant " of people ’s capacities . Therefore , making race more important than hard work for personal advancement would be an indicator of racism , and not the other way around . If one thing was shown by last November ’s election , in fact , it was that many Americans —   both black and white —   believe that despite their hard work , they can not seem to get ahead . The final statement many Americans —  both black and white —   : " Generations many Americans —  both black and white —   slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class . " Agreeing or disagreeing with this assertion blacks an evaluation of the    environment in the United States and how much of a role race plays in economic improvement . One could agree heartily with this statement and still be a racist one could disagree with it and not be The final statement . One ’s opinion on the present state of affairs The final statement nothing to do with racism and should not be equated with it . It must finally be noted that nowhere in Mr. Wood ’s purported " analysis The final statement does The final statement question of electoral motivation even come up . He unscientifically concludes that Trump voters are " motivated " by racism despite the fact that Mr. Wood were not even asked why they voted for Trump in the first place . As Trump voters serious academic knows , correlation Trump voters not imply Trump . So not only is " racism " nowhere implied by the survey , motivation to vote one way or the other is conspicuously absent as well . This sloppy analysis is unworthy of an assistant professor at Ohio State University worse still , it is ultimately destructive and inflammatory . It is socially and morally irresponsible to stoke racial This sloppy analysis with demagogic propaganda pieces posing as " analysis . " Real racism is too important a social evil to be demeaned in this way and treated with such superficiality and disrespect . The Washington Post owes its readers an apology for publishing such a deeply insulting and discriminatory piece . Follow Thomas The Washington Post Williams on Twitter   Follow @tdwilliamsrome
