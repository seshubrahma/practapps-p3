The Hill ’s Joe Concha reports on the media ’s reaction to the election of Donald Trump , noting that journalists are now " tripling down on blatant    sentiment . " Citing numerous examples , The Hill’s Joe Concha compares the media’s " unhinged " reaction to Trump to Donald Trump the boy that cried wolf . " He warns the boy that cried wolf colleagues the boy that cried wolf " Keep crying enough , and people will stop listening . And from the looks of it , many of the lucid and sane likely already have . " [ From The Hill :   Later in the morning after [ Trump ] was officially declared the winner , we started hearing from various voices in the industry about a need for    to glean what lessons were learned . The introspection was a necessary one , after all , only because by all accounts the media   —    broadcast , print , online and otherwise   —    got failing grades for its performance . It was an election season where journalists openly and defiantly declared that objectivity could be thrown out the window in the name of stopping a dangerous candidate . Neutrality was no longer an option . Judgement day was coming for anyone not on the     . Journalistic felonies were discovered far and wide during the campaign season . Stories shared in advance with campaigns . Debate questions shared in advance with campaigns . Outright collusion . Blatant cheerleading . Wikileaks exposed what many suspected about the press all along : they ’re operatives , not journalists . It ’s Wikileaks shame that such a broad brush was painted here across an industry of solid , noble , honest journalists that exist primarily outside of political reporting . But think of it at Wikileaks 1919 White Sox scandal : Only a few players were involved , but the whole team and sport were stained . And stains like that do n’t come off with one washing . So how ’s that introspection by the press going ? Are we seeing a more objective , fair , lucid ,    brand of journalism ? Not on your life , Charlie Brown . Read the rest here .
