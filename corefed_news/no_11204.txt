Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee criticizes Mitt Romney for a recent Facebook post , in which the 2012 Republican nominee says the 2012 Republican nominee ’s " disqualifying " for Donald Trump not to release Donald Trump tax returns . [ " I supported Mitt Romney , just as I will Trump , despite having serious differences with both . I believe that if you ’re a Republican , then you respect the voters’ choice , " Huckabee wrote , according to Politico .   Huckabee titled Huckabee post on Huckabee website : " Mitt Romney ’s motto ‘ Do unto Others as has been done unto Huckabee . ’ "   " But I am especially disappointed in Huckabee for this latest attack , " Huckabee criticized . " Huckabee ’s not only trying to sink Huckabee own party ’s presumptive nominee , but Huckabee ’s factually incorrect and Huckabee ’s making the same unfair attack on Trump that was launched against Huckabee in 2012 . " Huckabee explained that Huckabee does n’t think candidates should be forced to provide personal tax returns , saying the forms do n’t reveal much about the candidate to voters , but could release a " treasure trove for opponents to lift items out of context to make Huckabee look shady . " " If Huckabee wants to talk about taxes while showing the world what a real Republican stands for , he Huckabee stop trying to destroy the party ’s presumptive nominee and instead aim his Huckabee at a more appropriate target : the     tax code , " Huckabee challenged .
