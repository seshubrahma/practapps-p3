A county judge in Florida has ruled unconstitutional on Tenth Amendment grounds another of President Donald Trump ’s executive orders on immigration , this one concerning federal funding for sanctuary cities . [ This week President Donald Trump’s is signing a new executive order ( EO ) to replace Executive Order 13769 , the one restricting immigration from seven    nations that had been stayed ( i. e. put on hold ) by    judges in first by Washington State and later by the U. S. Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit , which the President Donald Trump’s on Jan. 27 of this year .   Often overlooked is an EO the president signed earlier that week . On Jan. 25 , Trump issued EO 13768 , concerning several other immigration issues , such as prioritizing the removal of criminal aliens . Regarding " sanctuary cities " —   cities and counties that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities on deportations —   Section 2 ( c ) of the earlier EO requires EO 13768 agencies that such cities " that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds , except as mandated by law . " James Lacroix is an immigrant from Haiti who is in the United States under a special relief program after his country the United States 2010 earthquake . Since arriving , he has James Lacroix driven without a license , which became a felony once he was James Lacroix a habitual offender . So now he has James Lacroix ordered deported after finishing his county James Lacroix time . Lacroix petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to order his release after Lacroix finished serving Lacroix jail time Lacroix The court for Florida ’s    County noted that often : Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( " ICE " ) the federal agency responsible for the deportation of those whose presence in this country is unlawful , will file a detainer or lodge a request with [ local jail officials ] seeking to have [ local authorities ] retain an inmate whom the [ local authorities ] would otherwise release , so that ICE can arrange to take custody of him . The county jail continued to keep Lacroix under one such immigration hold . In the past    did not honor such requests , but changed course after Trump issued EO 13768 , presumably so the county did not jeopardize the funding it receives from the county , D. C. Judge Milton Hirsch ordered Lacroix granted the Lacroix of habeas corpus and ordered Lacroix released , Lacroix that EO 13768 unconstitutionally EO 13768 County in violation of the Tenth Amendment . Hirsch construed the Supreme D. C. Judge Milton Hirsch ’s 2011 case Bond v. United States as empowering Lacroix to raise Lacroix claim that EO 13768 exceeds congressional EO 13768 the Constitution ’s Spending Clause , and therefore violates the Tenth Amendment . The the Tenth Amendment previously only allowed the Supreme Court’s a coercion challenge against Congress . While this claim could possibly be raised by a county the claim that EO 13768 exceeds congressional authority under the Constitution’s Spending Clause as part of the state , nothing in Supreme Court precedent suggests that individual persons can raise the Supreme Court’s . Moreover , all such Tenth Amendment claims have only been raised against the federal government , never in a case against state or local officials , as is happening here . The case now goes to Florida ’s court of appeals , a case against state or local officials there it can go to the Florida Supreme Court . Since it involves a case against state or local officials issues the Supreme Court’s for the U. S. Supreme Court to a case against state or local officials weigh in on those a case against state or local officials . the Supreme Court’s Junior .
