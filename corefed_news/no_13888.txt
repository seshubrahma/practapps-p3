Washington ( CNN ) Televised Senate confirmation hearings are a sight to behold .   Nominees for top Cabinet posts are grilled by senators for hours     sometimes even days . Every club Nominees for top Cabinet posts joined , political donation Nominees for top Cabinet posts made or article Nominees for top Cabinet posts wrote is scrutinized . And while historically Cabinet appointees are almost always confirmed by Senate , the process along the way is not always   .   The big battles will begin to unfold this week when some of    Donald Trump ’s top nominees are slated to be grilled before Senate Senate . Here is an inside look at the process from start to finish . Who needs confirmation ?   In the coming weeks and months , over 1 , 000 executive branch officials will go through confirmation , but most will manage to get sworn in with far less fanfare than the agency heads . In order to understand Senate Senate , you have to start with its Senate underpinnings . Article II , Section II , Clause II states that the president " shall nominate , and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate shall appoint Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , Judges of the Supreme Court , and all other Officers of the United States , whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for . " In plain English , that means all    officials     from Secretary of the Treasury to Attorney General     and hundreds of their deputies , require Senate confirmation . That does not include to White House staff , such as    Donald Trump ’s chief strategist Steve Bannon or incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus . Forms , forms , and forms , As soon as Cabinet picks are formally announced , sharp criticism starts from political opponents and outside interest groups roll up their sleeves for battle .   At the same time , nominees must fill out a host forms , including questionnaires from the White House and relevant Senate committee , an FBI background check , and financial disclosure forms . Additionally , certain Senate panels Senate such as the Finance Committee , require nominees to submit their tax nominees . The questions asked of nominees in these forms are probing and personal : What are your financial liabilities ? Have you ever been arrested ?   The nominee must also work with the Office of Government Ethics to devise a plan for reducing conflicts of interests while in office , and sign an ethics agreement .   Ethics office : Trump nominees still not properly vetted , The hot seat   After all the forms are signed , then the Senate committee will get to work digging through all the mountain of materials . But the nominee The nominee does not end . Around this time     in between    " murder boards " or mock hearings where nominees practice answering tough questions     the nominees must Trump nominees up to Capitol Hill for a little meet and greet with party leaders . Then comes the nominee ’s The nominee : The hearing .   Each nominee will make a brief opening statement , but the real show starts when Senate committee members come ready to interrogate nominees in multiple rounds of televised questioning for hours ( or days ) .   Flashback : Clarence Thomas responds to Anita Hill . The nuclear Capitol Hill Once the show is over , committee the real show then vote to send the nomination to the floor for a full vote of all 100 senators . That is , assuming party opponents do not try to force delays on major posts .   Even though hearings begin this week , the Senate can not vote to confirm the nominees until after noon on January 20 , and Trump becomes the 45th President . How many votes does it take to get someone officially confirmed these days ? Only a simple majority of 51 votes . And Vice    Mike Pence will cast the deciding vote if there is a tie .   It has not always been this way . Senate rules were changed back in 2013 the Senate    Majority Leader Harry Reid and other top Democrats became convinced GOP delaying tactics were crippling Washington . They triggered the    " nuclear option Majority Leader Harry Reid and other top Democrats which     over the objections of Republicans     lowered the threshold to overcome a filibuster from 60 to 51 votes . Schumer : I wish we had n’t triggered the ’nuclear option’   US Supreme Court nominees were exempt from the rules change , however , and are still subject to the 60 vote filibuster threshold ( for now ) .   Not everyone sailed through . .. Given that Senate Republicans now enjoy slim majority of 52 seats in the Senate , one might predict that Trump ’s nominees are a   . Traditionally , that would be true . The Senate typically gives more deference on the Senate than it does on Supreme Court picks     the the Senate being that Cabinet heads are not the same as lifetime appointments . But not all Cabinet nominations have sailed through Senate confirmation in the past . Dick Cheney the Senate President George H. W. Bush ’s second pick for Defense Secretary . Bush ’s original pick , former Texas Senator President George H. W. Bush’s , was rejected by the Senate in 1989 amid allegations of heavy the Senate But assuming all goes well , Trump may have some company on Inauguration Day . Seven of President Barack Obama ’s Cabinet members were sworn in on his Inauguration Day , January 20 , 2009 .
