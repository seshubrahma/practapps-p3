Philadelphia ( CNN ) A jovial President Barack Obama lit into Donald Trump Tuesday , using A jovial President Barack Obama first solo campaign appearance to openly question A jovial President Barack Obama ’s fitness for the presidency . Obama A jovial President Barack Obama n’t directly address Hillary Clinton ’s bout with pneumonia , which has kept her Hillary Clinton as the campaign enters its the campaign stretch . But he Hillary Clinton issue a warning for anyone who ’s questioning the Democratic candidate ’s ability to perform the job . " You want to debate who ’s more fit to be president ? One candidate has traveled to more countries than any other secretary of state has . Has more qualifications than any candidate in history . And the other who is n’t fit in any way shape or form to represent this country abroad or to be its this country in chief , " Obama said at roaring campaign rally in Philadelphia . He Obama questions about Clinton ’s transparency , which arose after she Clinton quiet her Clinton diagnosis for several days . Instead , he Obama into Trump ’s decision to withhold his Obama returns , a historic break from precedent .   " You want to debate transparency ? You ’ve got one candidate in this race who ’s released decades’ worth of her Clinton returns . The other candidate is the first in decades who refuses to release any at all , " Obama said . For Obama Obama Tuesday ’s event was a return to the rollicking campaign events that thrust him Obama the White House eight years ago , and won him Obama in 2012 . He Obama as he Obama the stage here it was " good to be back on the campaign trail , " a sentiment that was returned by loud cheers by the crowd of hundreds . " Can I just say I am really into electing Hillary Clinton ? " Obama told the crowd , which enthusiastically greeted him Obama " This is not me just going through the motions here . I really , really , really want to elect Hillary Clinton . " Obama Obama just one of a cavalry of top White House Democrats     also including First Lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden     who are arguing Clinton ’s case this week as the Democratic nominee herself is convalescing from pneumonia and absent from the trail . The timing is opportune for a campaign eager both to spotlight its a campaign eager both popular surrogates and to move past a rocky patch . While Obama ’s Philadelphia stop was planned well ahead of Clinton Clinton’s that half of her Clinton ’s supporters were " deplorable " and new worries about her Clinton , the campaign hopes the President ’s rally can at least provide a new storyline . But even an appearance from Obama     Obama rating reached a nearly    high of 58 % in an    Post poll Monday     wo n’t necessarily cure all of Clinton ’s woes as the campaign enters the campaign stretch . the campaign White House Monday said Obama would not Obama relegated to " damage control " for Clinton ’s stumbles , Clinton declined to address either Clinton " deplorable "    or her illness directly . Instead Clinton Obama leaned hard Obama his criticisms of Obama , using his stature as Obama in chief to disqualify the Republican candidate . Hillary Clinton stumbles   — Clinton will her campaign follow ? " You Clinton got the Donald , who just last week went on Russian television to talk down our military and curry favor with Vladimir Putin , " Obama said , referring to an interview appearance on RT . " He loves this guy ! Think Vladimir Putin what ’s happened in the Republican Party , " Obama said . " They used Obama be opposed to the Republican Party and authoritarianism and fighting for freedom . Now their nominee is out there praising the Republican Party guy , saying he ’s a strong leader , their nominee he invades smaller countries , jails their nominee opponents . " " This their nominee n’t Abraham Lincoln ’s Republican Party , " Obama added later . " This is a dark , pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against one another , where we turn against the world . They are n’t offering serious solutions , they are fanning resentment , and They . That is not the America I know . " Michelle Obama is also stumping for Obama week . The first lady makes her first campaign Obama Democratic nominee on Obama , promoting voter registration in Northern Virginia . Loathe to engage directly in bitter partisan politics , the first lady is more likely to spell out Obama case for Clinton , according to aides . Biden , who talked up Clinton during a stop Monday in Charlotte , was more candid Clinton his assessments , suggesting the candidate gets a " bum rap Clinton when he was asked about her remarks casting some of Trump ’s Clinton as deplorable . the candidate For every time she will say something where she says , ’Well , maybe the candidate should have said something the candidate think if they held Trump to that standard , " Biden said . " He Trump’s be in trouble . He is in trouble . Clinton Obama ’s busy schedule a Clinton , Even as Clinton is increasingly relying on Obama to carry her message to young and minority voters , Obama demands on Clinton President ’s time have largely forestalled an aggressive campaign schedule thus far . Tuesday ’s event in Philadelphia is only Obama ’s second campaign stop for Clinton , after a joint Obama in Charlotte in July . Clinton then , Obama has helped raised money from Democratic donors , including during Obama vacation on Martha ’s Vineyard last month , but he Obama n’t headlined another rally until now . White House Obama point to a largely inflexible schedule of presidential commitments this month as a barrier to more frequent campaigning . While last month have faced similar obligations in the waning days of their tenures , Obama is more popular     and thus in higher past presidents as a campaigner than his most recent predecessors . In August , Obama ’s aides made Obama     assessment of the President ’s commitments Obama day , discovering few moments in September that would allow for rallies in key battleground states on behalf of Clinton .   Obama on Friday concluded a    swing through Asia , with stops on Obama front end in Nevada , Hawaii and Midway Island meant to burnish his environmental legacy . Even Tuesday ’s rally was restricted to a relatively Obama location . Obama had business at the White House Monday evening when he met with Obama leaders , and is due to meet Burmese State Obama Aung San Suu Kyi in the Oval Office on Wednesday . Obama ’s    obligation at the United Nations General Assembly next week makes Obama a campaign stop difficult before the end of the month . And while the campaign may arise implicitly during Obama ’s final address to the gathering of world leaders     he ’s Obama recap eight years of foreign policy , providing a contrast Obama Trump ’s proposals     it ’s hardly the setting for a fiery political   . Even in October , when the race will enter its frenzied sprint , the demands of the presidency mean an         presence for the race is unrealistic . Already the President ’s schedule is filling up . The White House announced Monday that Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi would visit on October 18 , a    affair that will stretch into a late State Dinner . A government funding battle also seems likely to occupy the President ’s time this month . Many of the states that officials say the President’s     including Florida , North Carolina , Iowa , Pennsylvania and Obama     are easily accessible in a single    on Air Force One , but would leave few moments for other business at the White House . Given Obama ’s sway among young and minority voters     populations historically difficult to get Obama the polls     there is pressure for the President to hit many states before their voting registration deadline passes . In Florida , Ohio , Michigan , and Pennsylvania , many states means showing up before October 11 . " I think what is clear is that the President does have a lot of influence over a large number of voters that have the President been regularly engaged in politics , " Earnest said Monday , adding the Clinton campaign is " hoping that the President will be helpful in making the case on their behalf to motivate voters to get the President to participate on Election Day .
