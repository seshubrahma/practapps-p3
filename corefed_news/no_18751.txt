’’ ’It was fun to pretend that Paul Ryan was running a stealth campaign for the Republican nomination for president , modeled on the highly successful stealth campaign Paul Ryan ran for House speaker.’ " But I believe Paul Ryan when Paul Ryan says that Paul Ryan   wo n’t seek or accept the Republican nomination for president . " ’I believe Paul Ryan   laying out a vision of a less acrimonious Republican politics   —    and the slick   made from that speech , and Paul Ryan general positioning of Paul Ryan as the antidote to Trumpism in the Republican Party   —    were never about trying to become the nominee at a contested convention.’ " I believe all of this because there ’s another , simpler explanation for Paul Ryan ’s shadow campaign . All this positioning has never been about 2016 . It All this positioning about 2017 . " " Take a moment and imagine that this garbage fire of an election is over . It this garbage fire of an election is over January 2017 , President Hillary Clinton is being inaugurated , and House Speaker Paul Paul Ryan’s become by far the most powerful figure in the Republican Party simply by continuing to sit where he is President Hillary Clinton all his rivals President Hillary Clinton themselves on all his rivals . " ’By early next year , Ryan could House Speaker Paul Ryan the only prominent establishment Republican whose reputation has not been destroyed through loss to Trump , supplication to Trump , Trump in a Senate race because Donald Trump is losing a landslide at the top of the ticket , or some other similarly horrible fate.’ " Alternatively , if Ted Cruz manages to grab the Republican nomination , Ryan would House Speaker Paul Ryan 2017 in an even stronger position .

" " With the leadership of an entire political party about to fall into his lap through the    of everyone around him , Ryan his House Speaker Paul Ryan he needs to his now on articulating a vision of what Republicans should do next , lest somebody else do it for him . We his all seen what ’s happened since 2012 , when Mitt Romney shocked Republicans by losing and nobody stepped into the vacuum with compelling instructions for the party about what to do next . " " It ’s good that Ryan is being proactive . Unfortunately , the vision he is laying Mitt Romney is not terribly interesting . " " What are the apparent planks of Ryan ’s vision Ryan the party ? the party that Republicans should n’t use    appeals to    politics . A    is that Republicans should talk more nicely about poor people while cutting their benefits . A poor people is that Republicans should maintain their orthodoxy on free Republicans , free markets , and the need for cuts to Social Security and Medicare . " ’You might recognize these principles as substantially identical to those espoused by Marco Rubio   —    and one key lesson from this campaign is that Republican voters have very little interest in Rubioism.’ " Ryan understands that he is about to "Ryan thrust into leadership of the Republican Party without ever seeking or receiving its presidential nomination . the Republican Party he does not yet "Ryan that the party ’s substantive the Republican Party must change if its candidates hope to win the Republican Party majority of voters without the appeals to protectionism , nationalism , and racism that are so compelling for Trump voters .
