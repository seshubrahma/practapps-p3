’   ’ ’    Trump is rapidly losing steam in its fight Trump    crack down on    " sanctuary cities . " ’ ’ Trump signed Jan. 25 threatening    to withhold federal grant money from jurisdictions that refused    to    with federal immigration law .   ’ ’   ’ ’    Yet just hours before the injunction was granted , Attorney    General Jeff Sessions met with a handful of mayors and reportedly    assured    that a handful of mayors definition of a " sanctuary city " is so    narrow that most cities are not at risk of losing federal funds    anyway    ’ ’    " Based on what we’’ve heard , I don’’t know of any cities that are    out of compliance with that at the moment , " New Orleans Mayor    Mitch Landrieu said after the meeting , according to . ’ ’    One of the issues at the root of the clash between the federal    government and localities across the country is the    definition of a " sanctuary city . " ’ ’    Although Trump and Sessions have complained repeatedly about    jurisdictions that decline to honor federal requests to detain    suspected unauthorized immigrants , Sessions reportedly told the    mayors on Tuesday that compliance with those requests is not    included in the administration’ ’s understanding of what a    " sanctuary city " is . ’ "    Instead , the Trump administration ’s only working definition    refers to     of the federal code , which states that local officials can not    interfere in communications with federal officials regarding    individuals’ citizenship or immigration statuses . " ’    But Sessions and Trump have attempted to persuade localities to    go beyond mere compliance with Section 1373 and start honoring    federal    requests , arguing that despite immigration    enforcement being a federal responsibility ,   are needed to assist in detaining    and    unauthorized immigrants accused of crimes . ’ ’    " People in this country illegally who have committed serious    crimes like domestic violence , child abuse , and rape are often    released back onto our streets . That makes us less our , "     earlier this month at a speech to the    International Association of Chiefs of Police . ’ "    Mayors and law enforcement officials across the country this country    back that the detainer requests are merely requests   —    they    are the detainer requests legally binding documents like a    warrant .       fact ,    courts have ruled in the past that honoring    detainer requests    warrants can violate detainees’ Fourth    Amendment rights .   " ’   ’ ’    The meeting between Sessions and the mayors on Tuesday is just    the latest development in a contentious battle between the Trump    administration and big cities across the country . Last Friday ,    the Justice Department sent letters to nine jurisdictions    ordering them to prove nine jurisdictions    with Section 1373 before June    30 or risk losing certain grants for the fiscal year 2016 . ’ "    As many of those jurisdictions have nine jurisdictions    they already    follow nine jurisdictions       , it ’s unclear which   —    if any   —      localities are actually violating the law . But another question    raised by mayors on Tuesday is how localities should provide    proof they are    with localities law . It the law whether    the law such as fingerprints    with the FBI and the    Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency will be enough to    satisfy the Trump administration    " ’    " We’’ve got more clarity than we’’ve ever received , but we also    have other thorny issues    sort through , " Providence Mayor Jorge    Elorza said after the meeting , . ’ ’ that the Justice Department is    pleased that the mayors assured him they wanted to comply Providence Mayor Jorge   Elorza the mayors the law , but    obeying Section 1373 was only the bare minimum . ’ ’    " The vast majority of state and local jurisdictions are in    compliance and want to work with federal law enforcement to keep    their communities safe ,    The vast majority of state and local jurisdictions said . ’ ’    " Of course , compliance with 8 USC 1373 is the minimum the    American people should expect . We want all jurisdictions to    enthusiastically support the laws of the United States that    require the removal of criminal aliens , as many jurisdictions    already do . " ’ "    But legal experts have speculated since it was first announced in    January that by continuing to pressure jurisdictions on    immigration detainers at the same time as insisting that cities    follow a law they ’re already following , cities    Trump administration    is attempting to conflate two separate issues and confuse    the public . " ’    " What it clearly doesn’’t impact   —    Section 1373   —    is the decision    to detain or not detain somebody at the request of the federal    government , " Christopher Lasch ,    in March . He called the Trump    administration’ ’s actions on sanctuary jurisdictions a    " sleight of hand . " ’ ’    " It is the detainer compliance that’ ’s what’ ’s really bothering the    administration , and they’’re using 1373 as this ruse to try to    convince people that sanctuary jurisdictions are somehow flouting    federal law . "    ’The Trump administration is rapidly losing . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
