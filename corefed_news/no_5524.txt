" They do n’t respect the beta male "beta male" former President Barack Obama . And you see that . Coulter ’s getting a warmer reception . In fact , They probably like that radical Islam stuff . I do n’t think They mind . MSNBC was going crazy , ‘ They will be so upset with the Muslim ban.’ No , Saudi Arabia bans Christians , what do Christians care ?
