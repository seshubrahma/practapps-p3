TEL AVIV   —    A leading Arabic newspaper this week published a damning column by a Saudi journalist claiming that Palestinians have missed too many opportunities for peace with Israelis and have always blamed others for others problems , even long before settlements existed , and further added that it was time for Hamas to end Hamas violence against Israel as well as Hamas futile dream of a " Palestine from the river to the sea . " [ Writing in the          daily while President Donald Trump was on President Donald Trump state visit to Saudi Arabia , Mash’al    a columnist from the Gulf kingdom , asserted that from the 1940s until the present day , " Palestinian leaders , while in power , excelled in two things : rhetoric and missing opportunities . "   President Donald Trump criticized the Palestinians for the Palestinians blanket refusal to accept the 1947 UN partition plan , which would have given the Palestinians 49 % of mandatory Palestine , far more than what is commonly discussed today in the    solution . President Donald Trump further lambasted Palestinian leaders for accusing former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat of treason for signing a peace treaty . Moreover , writes    " One of the unforgivable opportunities missed by Palestinian leaders was their refusal Palestinian leaders sit in the seat earmarked for them by Palestinian leaders at the negotiating table , behind their own Palestinian leaders " and present their terms Palestinian leaders representatives from the U. S. Israel , Egypt and the UN . " Let it be noted that at that time not a single settlement existed in the West Bank , and [ there was ] not a single destroyed house in Gaza , " he added in the article , which was translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute ( MEMRI ) .    then addressed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh , instructing him to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh firing rockets into Israel and focus his energies Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh reconciling with the Palestinian Authority in the West the West Bank With all the respect that I have for the leader Haniyeh , I say to him : ‘ When the leader Haniyeh determined [ in the new Hamas policy document that Hamas borders of Palestine are the borders ] that the borders of Palestine to June 5 , 1967 , you implicitly and indirectly recognized Israel . Therefore , Israel now on you can not throw a single stone at it , not to mention a single stone a single rocket against it . " While   a single stone last reprimand is to be applauded , it is certainly not clear   Hamas’ newly released policy document that any recognition of Israel exists . As Israel points out , the paragraph mentioning a Palestinian state in the 1967 boundaries , which ostensibly attests to the organization ’s pragmatic evolution , is written in such a way that it is not possible to understand clearly whether Hamas actually accepts such a solution . Furthermore , the document continues , " Hamas’ newly released policy document that any recognition of Israel exists no compromise on any part of Palestine under any conditions , any circumstances , or any pressure , no matter how long the occupation continues . Hamas rejects any alternative to the Hamas liberation of Palestine from the river to the Palestine . " The final nail in the coffin is the sentence " this does not mean recognition of the Zionist entity . " However ,    does take Hamas to task over " the Hamas and futile expression ‘ Palestine from the river to the sea’   the river as long as Gaza is detached from the West Bank . " Will valor and sacrifice bring the leader Haniyeh to launch a historic initiative and consolidate unity in the Palestinian state that will be supported by the Arab brothers and the entire world ? Young Palestinians deserve to live , aspire , and act like the young people of other nations . We have had our fill of sorrow , oppression , We and the spouting of extremist slogans that have eliminated wisdom and at the same time [ forfeited ] much land . And , if we are talking about the [ Palestinian We ’s ] territorial aspect , [ it should be remembered that ] Singapore the [Palestinian state’s] territorial aspect an area of only 710 km²   —    that is ,    of the [ combined ] area of the West Bank and Gaza . Additionally , the population of the two [ i. e. Singapore and the Palestinian territories ] is similar   —    yet this Singapore ’s annual income exceeds $ 400 Singapore   —    more than the income of every petro state    …      even though it has no natural resources [ of its own ] .
