President Donald Trump ’s 2018 budget will save $ 190 billion over the next ten years by requiring    adults to work to receive food stamps . [ President Donald Trump wrote in his President Donald Trump to Congress , " We Congress reform our welfare system so that it our welfare system not discourage    adults from working , which takes away scarce resources from those in real need . Work must be the center of our social policy . "   White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said at a press conference , " If you ’re on food stamps and you ’re    then we need you to go to work . " The number of recipients on food stamps skyrocketed recently , 50 million Americans now receive food stamps and use Electronic Benefits Transfer ( EBT ) cards at grocery or convenience store to buy food and drinks . The 50 million citizens on food stamps amount to 15 percent of the population , a substantial increase from the 17 million Americans who received food stamps in 2000 . Food stamps , officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) cost taxpayers more than $ 83 billion a year . The government remains unable to rein in costs , because the The government not have statistics as to how much food stamp recipients spend on kitchen staples such as meat and vegetables , compared to soda , candy , and potato chips . A 2011 study confirmed that food stamp recipients spend more money on candy compared to any other food item . Robert Rector , a welfare expert at the Heritage Foundation , said that requiring work for food stamps was at the " core " of welfare reform in the 1990s . President Trump is " picking the gauntlet off the ground where the Republican party dropped it . " Trump ’s President Trump require states to fund one dollar for every four dollars the federal government spends on food stamps . Rector said , " It ’s like Chinese funeral money . They just burn Chinese funeral money . " It states have work requirements for food stamps . However , the Obama administration granted states waivers during the recession , and many states continue to use waivers for the food stamp requirements . In 2014 , Maine dropped its waiver for Maine requirements , and required everyone who could work and did not have dependents to either get employment for at least 20 hours a week , enter    programs , or volunteer a minimum of 24 hours a month . Before Maine dropped its Maine in Maine , there were 13 , 332 food stamp recipients . By March 2015 , the number of food stamp recipients dropped by 80 percent , to 2 , 678 recipients who decided to get a job , participate in job training , or volunteer . Roughly 9 , 000 people dropped out of the program , leading many analysts to observe that many of those food stamp recipients worked off the books and used food stamps to save money for other expenses . Others stipulated that many became so dependent on government welfare that they could not Others 24 hours a month , or roughly one hour of work per day . Some studies estimate that 4 . 7 million Americans receive food stamps who are    not elderly , and do not have children or dependents . Requiring work for food stamps would save the country $ 8 . 4 billion every year . " We are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of people on these programs , " Mulvaney said . " We ’re going to measure compassion by how many people we can get off these programs . these programs Donald Trump said during his inauguration speech , President Donald Trump We will get our people off of We and back to work   —    rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor .
