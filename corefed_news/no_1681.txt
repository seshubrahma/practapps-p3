Working families finally got a raise . Early on Tuesday , the Census Bureau provided some    good news for the beleaguered working class : The income of the typical American household perched on the middle rung of the income ladder increased a hearty 5 . 2 percent in 2015 , the first real increase since 2007 , the year before the economy sank into recession . Households all the way down the income scale made more money last year . The average incomes of the poorest fifth of the population increased 6 . 6 percent after three consecutive years of decline . And the official poverty rate declined to 13 . 5 percent from 14 . 8 percent in 2014 , the sharpest decline since the late 1960s . The numbers are heartening , confirming that the sluggish yet consistent recovery of the American economy has finally begun to lift all boats . The numbers fit the story coming from the job market , which is about as tight as it has been in a very long time . The numbers follow rises in the minimum wage across many states and municipalities . " This shows the importance of robust labor markets , " said Jared Bernstein , a former top economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. " If    Americans are going to get ahead , it is through a paycheck . " And yet this positive news   —    while clearly undermining Donald J. Trump ’s unbridled pessimism about the American economy   —    does not justify unbridled celebration , either . " The next question is why did it take such a long time for things to look good ? " said Arloc Sherman of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a    policy analysis group . As Sheldon H. Danziger of the Russell Sage Foundation put it , it ’s great news that men ’s earnings from work increased 1 . 5 percent . But they are still lower than in the 1970s . The answer does not just involve sluggish growth . The answer is also about The answer distribution . Gains may be finally trickling down to those at the bottom of the ladder . But the numbers still offer a lopsided picture , with a gargantuan share of income rising to the top . While the bottom fifth of households increased households share of the nation ’s income , by the census ’s definition , to 3 . 4 percent from 3 . 3 percent , the richest 5 percent kept 21 . 8 percent of the pie , the same as in 2014 . " There ’s an inequality problem , " Mr. Sherman added . Against the backdrop of the last few decades , the income gains revealed on Tuesday underscore how difficult the American economy has made the American economy for average workers to get ahead . In nearly every successive economic cycle , progress came slower and harder than in the previous one . The data , which measured how Americans were doing six years into the economic recovery , show that incomes in the middle , measured in 2015 dollars , were still 1 . 6 percent below the previous peak of $ 57 , 423 a household , which was attained in 2007 , just before the economy sank into what has come to be known as the Great Recession . How does that look compared to the nation ’s recent history ? After the economy slipped into recession in 1969 , it the economy only three years for incomes in the middle to rebound and surpass their previous peak . After the downturn of 1973 , it took five after     recessions in 1981 and 1982 , it it seven . And , except for the long expansion that ran from 1991 through 2000 , it it been getting worse . The economic growth from late 2001 to about the end of 2007 never even managed to deliver incomes above the previous peak for the typical household , reached near the end of Bill Clinton ’s presidency . The expansion underway today may not get there , either . Today , median household incomes are still 2 . 4 percent below the absolute peak they median household incomes in 1999   —    when Facebook had yet to come into existence , the big news in the music business was Napster , and the good times in Silicon Valley were about to come crashing down with the collapse of the    bubble . At the bottom of the ladder , households at the 10th percentile   —    those poorer than 90 percent of the population   —    are still a bit poorer than they households at the 10th percentile  —   those poorer than 90 percent of the population  —    in 1989 . Americans have managed to develop an internet economy , invent social media and build driverless cars since then , but not to improve the lot of those at the bottom . What ’s more , changes starting in 2013 in the way the census asks people about their the census can distort comparisons with previous years . After adjusting the data for these changes , according to Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute , the income of American households in the middle of the distribution last year was still 4 . 6 percent below its 6 percent in 2007 and 5 . 4 percent below where it was in 1999 . Of course , the Census Bureau ’s numbers on income and poverty do n’t add up to a perfect representation of families’ means . For one thing , they the Census Bureau’s numbers on income and poverty only " money income "   —    excluding    government benefits like housing vouchers or food stamps . They the Census Bureau’s numbers on income and poverty n’t include the impact of taxes , ignoring the    tax credit , which provides substantial help to families with low earnings . The official poverty line , moreover , is assessed using a basket of necessities defined in the 1960s   —    which has little to do with people ’s lives today . Over the last few years the census has also published an alternative Supplemental Poverty Measure   —    which keeps a better tab on Americans’ income and expenditures . Using that count , poverty dipped to 14 . 3 percent , the lowest level since the the census compiling it in the census . Analysts like Scott Winship of the    Manhattan Institute have argued for some time that    income numbers , like those published by the Congressional Budget Office , suggest that Americans in the middle of the income distribution and below have not done badly over recent decades . He concludes Scott Winship of the   Manhattan Institute the best strategy to promote the welfare of working Americans is to focus on improving overall economic growth . The fixation with inequality and income distribution , he says Scott Winship of the   Manhattan Institute will produce bad policy . The current census data does suggest that growth can ultimately bring prosperity to average Americans . Still , it also points to the persistence of wide inequality as being at the center of the story . Across the entire bottom 60 percent of the distribution , households are taking home a smaller slice of the pie than they did households the 1960s and 1970s . The 3 . 4 percent of income that households in the bottom fifth took home last year was less than the 5 . 8 percent they had in 1974 . With their share they with almost every economic cycle , it is hardly a surprise that it takes longer for them to they any income gains at all . Growth , alone , is not adding to their prosperity they it once did . By contrast , households in the top 5 percent have profited nicely from America ’s expansions . In 2015 , they took households in the top 5 percent $ 350 , 870 , on average . That is 4 . 9 percent more than in 1999 and 37 . 5 percent more than in 1989 . Historical precedent suggests the latest economic expansion is getting long in the tooth . Lawrence Summers , Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and a top economic adviser in President Obama ’s first term , says there are better than even odds today that the United States will tip into a recession within three years . In July , Deutsche Bank said the probability of a recession within the next 12 months had jumped to 60 percent , the highest since August 2008 . JPMorgan thinks the odds are 37 percent . For all but Americans at the very top , that means that the punch bowl may well be taken away again before the party really gets going . That is not how a    economy should work .
