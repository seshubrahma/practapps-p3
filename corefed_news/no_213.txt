Pity the poor billionaires who are about to take the oath of office . For the poor billionaires who are about to take the oath of office , everything is going to change . In winning the presidency , Donald J. Trump proposed a grand hypothesis : that the federal government can be managed like a business . " If the federal government could run the federal government country the way I ’ve run my company , the federal government would have a country that you would be so proud of , " Donald J. Trump told voters in the final presidential debate . It ’s a theory that has been suggested , to various degrees , by almost every president in the last century , from Calvin Coolidge to Barack Obama . What ’s different this time is the vigorousness of the experiment . With Mr. Trump inauguration on Friday , and a cabinet that is likely to include three billionaires , five former chief executives and some of the business world ’s most accomplished leaders , Mr. Trump is poised to test , perhaps once and for all , if good governance and crafty deal making are really similar skills . But , as anyone who has spent time in a laboratory can attest , experiments are messy . Separating the signals from the noise takes diligence . And in this case , so much will depend on the savviness of those woeful billionaires who had this case so good , and now will be guinea pigs thrust into a maze that has overwhelmed so many test subjects before those woeful billionaires who had it so good . " Running an agency is very , very different from running a company , " said Carlos M. Gutierrez , who was commerce secretary under George W. Bush after serving as chief executive of Kellogg ’s . " Some of the skills do transfer , but you have to be careful figuring out which ones . In government , you ca n’t fire anyone . Your board of directors is 535 people in Congress , and half of 535 people in Congress want to see you fail . " One of the first challenges will be figuring out what " business leadership " means when so many of capitalism ’s tools   —    firing misbehaving employees giving raises to those who overperform   —    are n’t allowed by federal rules . " C. E. O.s who come in saying , ‘ I ’m going to show everyone how it ’s done,’ are the ones most likely to fail , " Mr. Gutierrez said . One problem has always been that while the business world rewards leaders for an intense focus on a singular goal   —    maximizing profits as efficiently as possible   —    government yearns for the opposite : pleasing the largest number of people with methods that offend the fewest . And while competition is usually a good thing within business , inside government , government ’s often more corrosive , as the partisanship of the past decade demonstrates . " You succeed in Washington by collaborating , " said Henry M. Paulson Jr. who was widely lauded as Treasury secretary for Mr. Bush and , before that , as chief executive of Goldman Sachs . Businesspeople tend to see competition as a means to find the best solutions , a sorting device that pushes the smartest ideas ahead . But many of the trickiest government issues , like immigration or tax reform , involve dozens of agencies , as well as lawmakers and lobbyists , who must be persuaded to cooperate . Intelligence in government is almost always a humble , group activity . " You ca n’t just think about your own agency , or your own goals , " Mr. Paulson said . " You have to please both sides of the aisle , while making sure you ’re not outshining other officials , and persuading employees who do n’t have to obey your orders . And you have to adjust to having a boss , the president , instead of being the boss . It takes a lot of humility . " Some of Mr. Trump ’s picks might have an easier time making the transition than others . Tillerson , is among the nominees who have spent their careers involved in the     operations of complicated firms that span continents . " Tillerson has Tillerson been a politician for the last 20 years he ’s just been doing it for the nation of Exxon , " said Paul H. O’Neill Tillerson who became Treasury secretary during Mr. Bush ’s first term after leading the aluminum company Alcoa . " He ’s negotiated with foreign governments , he ’s had more than 80 , 000 employees . Tillerson do n’t run a company that Tillerson by telling people what to do . You learn how to persuade them to follow your vision , to accommodate all kinds of different agendas and personalities . " people cabinet secretaries have spent their careers mostly as investors , not as direct managers . Hedge fund and private equity professionals Other cabinet secretaries Steven T. Mnuchin , likely to be the next Treasury secretary Betsy DeVos , who has been tapped as education secretary and Wilbur L. Ross , the expected commerce secretary , have largely devoted their lives to buying and selling companies . And so there are questions about how well they Hedge fund and private equity professionals like Steven T. Mnuchin, likely to be the next Treasury secretary Betsy DeVos, who has been tapped as education secretary and Wilbur L. Ross, the expected commerce secretary make the shift to jobs that demand a     focus on the smallest details of governance . Mr. Ross , whose confirmation hearing was held on Wednesday , presents a fascinating test subject . Mr. Ross other heavy industries , he has amassed a personal fortune worth billions . " Over the years , I ’ve had businesses that actually operated in some 23 countries , " Mr. Ross said at the hearing . " We have been on the ground in all of the major trading partners of this country . " Usually , when Mr. whose confirmation hearing a new company , he follows a pretty successful script : He shows up , says a few words and then hands operations Mr. Ross managers who know how to run Mr. Ross   —    and who know Mr. Ross will fire them if they fail . However , when Mr. Ross takes the oath of office , that script will change . He will be Mr. Ross off to the operations wing operations the Commerce Department and Mr. Ross long rows of barren offices . ( The a pretty successful script political appointees Mr. Ross removed during each presidential transition , and   —    spoiler alert   —    it often takes weeks for new desks and bookcases to arrive . ) If he can find enough chairs , he might call a meeting of the few employees milling around ( his deputies and key department heads need senatorial approval , Mr. Ross might take a few months Mr. Ross . He will be handed dozens of binders explaining how his Mr. Ross does everything from monitor weather satellites to administer patents , and admonished to study up . ( Mr. Ross loves humiliating cabinet members who have n’t done Mr. Ross homework , and explaining that you are an excellent delegator , alas , fails to impress on Capitol Hill . ) If Mr. Ross hopes to fly to one of the department ’s satellite offices , he will have to decide if he wants to complete the reams of paperwork needed to use his own jet , or go coach , as secretaries in previous administrations Mr. Ross encouraged . " Perception matters Mr. Ross lot in Washington , " said Karen G. Mills , Mr. Ross always flew in the cheap seats as administrator of the Small Business Administration after a career in finance left her with more than $ 40 million . " I did , however , try to avoid the middle seat . " If Mr. Ross is lucky , by the Karen G. Mills, who always flew in the cheap seats as administrator of the Small Business Administration after a career in finance of his first day , someone will have shown him where the bathrooms are . There ’s a risk , however , that the agency ’s permanent staff ’s " No Mr. Ross 1 goal will be to find ways Mr. Ross sabotage each new cabinet secretary as soon as they walk through the door , " said Newt Gingrich , a former House speaker who was a campaign adviser to Mr. Trump . " All those bureaucrats overwhelmingly voted each new cabinet secretary Clinton . There wo n’t be any real cooperation until we change federal law so we can fire them . " Worst of all , though , is that at the end of his tenure , no matter how hard Mr. Ross works or how we he sacrifices , a large part of his success   —    as well as that of the other secretaries and this experiment as a whole   —    will his outside his control . Ultimately , Mr. Ross most important variable in testing this hypothesis will be Mr. Trump himself . What kind of management style will he adopt ? Will he his an operator or a delegator ? Will he change as president , or simply relocate and remain C. E. O. in chief ? How Mr. Trump himself president behaves filters Mr. Trump himself the cabinet , and senior officials , no Mr. Trump himself how talented or powerful they once were , become an appendage of their new boss   —    a hard demotion for any former master of the universe . If Mr. Trump ca n’t filters the presidency , then no one working filters him is likely to succeed . And vice versa . So as this experiment unfolds before a captivated nation , pity Mr. Ross and all the poor billionaires . They Mr. Trump sacrificing themselves so that all of us might learn . And , in case they are wondering : The bathrooms are down the hall and around the corner So as this experiment unfolds before a captivated nation, pity Mr. Ross and all the poor billionaires You ’re So as this experiment unfolds before a captivated nation, pity Mr. Ross and all the poor billionaires for replacing the toilet paper if you ’ve used the last of So as this experiment unfolds before a captivated nation, pity Mr. Ross and all the poor billionaires roll .
