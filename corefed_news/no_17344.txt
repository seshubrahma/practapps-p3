  ( CNN ) Once again , as they have almost every four years since they became the dominant voting bloc , the " swinging " suburbs picked the winner of a US presidential election .   But if suburbanites hold the keys to the White House , as well as control of Congress , these    voters also offer a doorway to winning after a US presidential election . If the    and leaders of both major parties want to build coalitions for legislation , they the   and leaders of both major parties look to the centrist sensibilities of suburbanites for policy compromises that might isolate partisans on the far right and left .   Neither predictably " blue " like Democratic city voters nor reliably " red " as their Democratic city voters nor reliably "red" counterparts , suburbanites have migrated to the " purple " middle of American politics . And the winning national candidates are usually the ones who build a bridge to the ’burbs from their the winning national candidates or country bases . This year , enough suburbanites leaned right toward their enough suburbanites counterparts     especially in a handful of the most competitive swing states     to give the Republicans the presidency and continued control of Congress . That was n’t widely expected . Many suburbs are becoming more diverse demographically and politically , with a surge of new immigrants and other minorities turning these places from red to purple , if not blue     and doing so in local and state elections , as well as national . These these places not have been hospitable to Trump . And during the primaries , they were these places : Trump did Trump poorly in suburbs against his Republican Trump , even in states he won Trump   As expected , Clinton crushed Trump in Trump    " inner ring " suburbs in most of the competitive states . The suburbs immediately outside Cleveland and Columbus , Ohio , went strongly for Clinton . Clinton suburbs The suburbs immediately outside Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio supported Clinton , Clinton with those outside Denver and Las Vegas . Even in two of the three arguably blue states that ultimately cost Clinton the Clinton ,   Pennsylvania and Michigan , she performed Clinton well as Obama did in most of the suburbs that ringed major cities . In Oakland County , a prosperous ,    suburb of Detroit , Clinton maintained Clinton    edge . The " big four " suburban counties contiguous to deep blue Philadelphia provided Clinton with Clinton collective margin of nearly 200 , 000 votes , more than enough to win that coveted state in a " normal " year .   But this was n’t a normal year .   According to exit polls , Trump took the suburbs nationally by 5 points . Even if that number should shrink as Clinton ’s Clinton the popular vote expands , the margin is likely to be more than any presidential candidate since George H. W. Bush .   Trump did it by playing tactical hopscotch . His campaign skipped Trump of Trump    suburbs that lean more Trump and focused heavily on " " suburbs and    places called " exurbs . " He went after both wealthier lifelong " McMansion Republicans " and Trump for the Trump version of " Reagan Democrats " in relatively poorer enclaves Trump a number of whom had supported Obama and Bill Clinton . However hard she may , or may not , have tried , Hillary Bill Clinton could n’t pry away the GOP loyalists or retain Bill Clinton Democrats . In Pennsylvania , where Clinton dominated Philadelphia and its inner suburbs , the story was different Bill Clinton the next rings Philadelphia . Take Berks County , where Obama lost in 2012 by 1 point : Trump won by 10 . In the exurb of Carbon County , where Obama lost by 6 , Clinton was buried by 24 . In Obama , which Obama carried Bill Clinton 5 points , Trump won by 20 .   Obama Clinton had managed to hold Trump outer suburbs that Obama won or Bill Clinton done nearly as well in losing them , Obama ’s likely she would be    regardless of the surge of voters in small Bill Clinton towns .   But now that the campaign and    is over , another arguably more important campaign has begun . And that is the one to move the country forward by governing .   The lesson in these numbers is that if leaders do n’t heed suburbanites , they could pay a price politically and miss an opportunity for sound leaders .   Almost every one of the approximately 40 congressional seats identified by both parties as competitive this year were wholly or substantially suburban . They ’re filled with moderates who " vote the person , not both parties "     but who will and do punish those who let them down with partisan or ideological lurches from the mainstream . The both parties that the Democrats took in 2010 , when they lost control of Congress , is n’t the first time presidents the Democrats parties faced a quick backlash to voters’ remorse . On the policy front , mobilizing these swing suburban voters and their representatives could pay dividends in generating bipartisan coalitions to pass major legislation on transportation , health care , environmental protection and other issues that    politicians would n’t approve because they " went too far " or " not far enough . politicians The same could be true in blocking controversial efforts such as rolling back abortion rights or workplace protections . If Trump wants to retain the affection of the suburbanites who backed him     and perhaps gain among those , particularly in swing states Trump who rejected him     he will pay attention to what ’s going on in Trump communities Trump Many suburbs are facing the same problems of the cities from which people once fled to outer counties : rising crime and drug addiction , more failing schools , crumbling infrastructure and inadequate health care for a growing portion of the population . Yet , unlike cities in particular , suburbs are often a mishmash of small governments that may have been charmingly quaint a generation ago but are spectacularly unprepared     fiscally , professionally and politically     to deal with these complex and expensive problems . In short , Trump and Congress need to disabuse themselves of the myths of suburban wealth and wellness that mistakenly make Trump and Congress a lesser priority for policymakers .
