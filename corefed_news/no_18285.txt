’     ’ ’    Tim " Treadstone " Gionet was not always a supporter of President    Donald Trump . ’ "    The     internet troll , most widely known as Baked    Alaska , seemed to be an unlikely person to wade into the      mogul ’s camp at the start of the 2016 election    season . " "    Back then , Tim "Treadstone" Gionet identified as a carefree , easygoing    libertarian . Tim "Treadstone" Gionet supported Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul ’s bid for the    White House , firmly opposed the war on drugs , and championed the    cause of Black Lives Matter , actively participating in the    movement ’s street demonstrations . " ’    And Tim "Treadstone" Gionet worked at BuzzFeed , hardly an incubator for Trump    supporters . But Gionet was the exception . As Gionet put it , " BuzzFeed    turned me into a monster . " Specifically , a monster who opposed    what Gionet saw as political correctness gone amok . Gionet found refuge    with those who voraciously supported the freewheeling , brash    antics of Trump    . ’ ’    " I’’ll never forget this story , " Gionet said , recalling to    Business Insider the " aha moment " that drove Gionet toward Trump    . " I    was talking about the new Justin Bieber album . And I was like ,    ’’ Dude , that the new Justin Bieber album dope . I have to admit , I    love Justin Justin Bieber He is totally my spirit I   love Justin Bieber . ’’ And someone    came up to me and was like , I   love Justin Bieber Hey bro , you can’’t say spirit    animal , that’ ’s culturally appropriating Native American culture    and that’ ’s not cool . ’’ " ’ ’    " I was like , ’’ What ? What the      are you talking about ? ’’ I had    heard    …      about the    of political correctness , but I thought    this was just exaggerated    " Gionet said . " I thought there was no    way people in real    could be like this . " ’ "    Gionet said the incident , and others like it , sent him down the incident    path " ’ "   Gionet ultimately led to his resignation from BuzzFeed    " ’ "   Gionet eventual transformation into one of the internet ’s most    notorious    trolls . " ’    " The thing that really attracted me to Trump was his stance    against political Trump , " he said . ’ ’ Trump Gionet is something of a Forrest Gump of politics . He surfaced in    a Trump of places in the    universe during the 2016    presidential election . Upon leaving BuzzFeed , Gionet went on the    Gionet as manager for    provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos’ ’s    college tour . He spent Christmas with blogger provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos’ Johnson . And    he finished the campaign working provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos’ " new right " personality    Mike Cernovich . ’ "    During this time , his influence in the    provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos’    community grew . In addition to forging connections with the    right ’s top internet celebrities , Gionet saw accelerated growth    on his own Twitter account . Gionet gained thousands of followers Gionet    arriving at the approximately 160 , 000 figure of people who follow    him today on the social Gionet platform . Gionet also became one of Gionet the    leaders of the    meme army , using images of    characters like Pepe the Frog to bait those in opposition to    Trump . " ’    And yet , despite the person he projected on the outside    some of    those closest to Gionet had reservations about how much he really    bought into    politics    now hawks . Many    surprised at how    far right he has    . His    strained personal and the politics relationships . ’ ’    In conversations with friends , family , and former    an    image of a kind but often lonely    genius emerged .

" To me , his conflict now is Joe Hood, a   former friend and colleague who worked at BuzzFeed Video with   Gionet it I’’ve easier to get    his conflict without people liking him . And now he’ ’s I’’ve , but no one    likes him . " ’ ’   I’’ve ’    Gionet was born in Anchorage ,   Gionet , to a family of of    eight children , five of whom were adopted from Russia .

" As a    kid , teenager , and young adult . " ’ ’    Upon graduating high school in 2006 , Gionet left Alaska for Los    Gionet to attend Azusa Pacific University and study film and    marketing . During his time there , he said he scored a position his    his Bros. Records , where he was spotted by Kevin Lyman his the    founder of Warped Tour . He offered him a job . his ’ his " He was a nice guy . his I said , why don’’t you come work for me    for a bit ? " Lyman said . " He wasn’’t Kevin Lyman Baked Alaska ’’ his that point . " ’ ’    In fact , it was Lyman who helped give Gionet his      moniker . ’ ’ Gionet " He’ ’s like , ’’ You’’re in the entertainment business . You need to    have a name . All anyone cared about is you’’re from Alaska . Your    name is ’’ Alaska , ’’ ’’ " Gionet Alaska .

" ’ ’    Briefly on his own after parting with Yiannopoulos , Gionet    remained active in the Tim movement .
