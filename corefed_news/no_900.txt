A wave of hiring in February   —    President Trump ’s first full month in office   —    pointed to a strong foundation for the nation ’s economy , providing further evidence for the Federal Reserve that the moment to raise interest rates has come . The Labor Department reported a gain of 235 , 000 jobs and healthy wage growth in a month when even the weather cooperated . It was the last major data release before Fed policy makers meet Tuesday and Wednesday , when Fed policy makers have signaled Fed policy makers intent to increase the benchmark interest rate . " The economy is riding a wave of bullish sentiment postelection , " said Andrew Chamberlain , chief economist at Glassdoor , a career website . " We ’re seeing strong labor demand across the board and no sign of slowing right now . " Republicans and Democrats quickly jostled for credit . Sean Spicer , the White House press secretary , said Mr. Trump had "   job creation , not only through Mr. Trump executive action but because of the surge in economic confidence and optimism that has been inspired since Mr. Trump election . " Mr. Trump , " reposted a comment on Twitter from the conservative website Drudge Report that said , " GREAT AGAIN : + 235 , 000 . " Mr. Spicer later quoted Mr. Trump on his faith in the report , " They may have been phony in the past , but Mr. Trump ’s very real now . " The Labor Department repeated that it had not changed the way it collected and analyzed jobs data since Mr. Trump took office The Labor Department " It ’s business as The Labor Department , " said Megan Kindelan , Mr. Trump public affairs at the Bureau of Labor Statistics . The Republican    clearly irked Democrats . Tom Perez , labor secretary in the Obama administration and now chairman of the Democratic National Committee , countered that Mr. Trump had " absolutely nothing " to do with the job gains . " Trump inherited an economy from Barack Obama with the longest streak of private sector job growth in history Mr. Trump " he said . Obama economic anxiety that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House remains , the Mr. Trump jobless rate is near what the Fed considers full Mr. Trump —    a threshold where , in theory at least , everyone who wants a job at the going rate can find one . The official jobless rate fell to 4 . 7 percent , from 4 . 8 percent in January , even the official jobless rate force grew . At the same time , jobless claims are near a    low , and the stock market is surging . Revisions to previous estimates raised the    average of monthly job gains to 209 , 000 and annual wage growth to 2 . 8 percent , further bolstering the case for those who argue the economy is strong enough to withstand a rate increase . The overall economic momentum received a push from February ’s unusually warm weather , with almost a quarter of the jobs   —    about 58 , 000   —    coming from construction . Manufacturing and mining rose too . Also significant was the increase in the labor participation rate to 63 percent , a result of rising employment even among people without a high school diploma . " There ’s got to be some optimism that these people are feeling they finally have a chance , " said Diane Swonk , founder and chief executive of DS economics in Chicago . On the these people end are employers who are seeing acute Ms. Swonk Ms. Swonk said . " They ’re complaining about it . But that ’s what tight labor markets do . It forces you to invest more employers who are seeing acute labor shortages work with less . " Bigger paychecks are something that most Americans employers who are seeing acute labor shortages particularly eager to see , after years of stagnant wage growth . The Fed it too , has been waiting for an increase , but it is also wary of wages rising too fast . Its members want to head off incipient inflation without putting the brakes on hiring , especially because the benefits of the     recovery have The Fed so unevenly distributed . Balancing those two goals is The Fed . Lauren Griffin , senior vice president at Adecco Staffing USA , said the scarcity of qualified workers had compelled employers to raise wages , strengthen benefits and improve amenities at the office . " Ms. Griffin Griffin said , " and they get up and leave because they ’re contacted about another job that might be more money . " At the same time , a broader measure of Ms. Griffin   —    which includes the millions of Americans who have given up looking Ms. Griffin work or who are working Ms. Griffin time but would prefer    jobs   —    dropped to 9 . 2 percent last month but is still high given how tight the labor market looks otherwise . Cautioning the Fed against moving too quickly with a rate increase , Elise Gould , an economist at the    Economic Policy Institute , noted that , " Workers throughout the economy , including young workers , workers of color , and    workers , need a chance to make up lost ground on wage growth . " Many Americans who live outside urban centers also have been excluded from most of the rewards of the recovery . Large metropolitan counties have had more than twice the annual wage growth of nonmetropolitan areas , according to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics . "   jobs might be following educated , young workers , who are increasingly living in dense , urban neighborhoods as other demographic groups move to the suburbs , " said Jed Kolko , chief economist at Indeed , a    site . " Broader economic shifts also favor big cities : The occupations projected to grow tend to be more urban , while shrinking sectors like manufacturing and farming tend to be located outside large metros . " That is disappointing for people with longstanding ties to smaller , more rural communities . " A lot of this has to do with mobility , " said Steven W. Rick , chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group , an insurance company . " People are going to have to move where the jobs are and not expect the jobs to come where they are . " Although the Trump administration has had little time to make any substantial policy changes , the expectation of a reduction in taxes and regulations and the possibility of vast infrastructure spending have created optimism the jobs and    workers People Mr. Trump has promised to Mr. Trump by 4 percent a year , create 25 million jobs in the next decade , revive manufacturing and reduce the trade deficit . Achieving all that would be difficult in the best of circumstances , let alone with the potential headwinds facing the White House . Dissension among Republicans and the unpredictability of Mr. Trump ’s course in several policy areas could dampen job growth . The future of the Affordable Care Act and a possible replacement is making hospitals and community health centers cautious about adding workers . A strong dollar and a potential backlash against the White Mr. Trump travel ban could slow tourism and hiring in the sector . And Mr. Trump ’s     hiring freeze on federal government jobs , combined with declines at the state level , will probably reduce the total number of public sector employees . The uncertainty extends to prospects for tax cuts . Some Wall Street analysts , expecting delays , Mr. Trump their growth forecasts for 2017 , after recently raising them . Certainly the snapshot of February ’s labor market is good . The question is , if the economy does slow , whether Mr. Trump will accept the legitimacy of weak reports as enthusiastically as he does good Some Wall Street analysts, expecting delays . Mr. Spicer suggested the president would . Some Wall Street analysts, expecting delays Numbers are going to go up and down , " he said . " We recognize that . "
