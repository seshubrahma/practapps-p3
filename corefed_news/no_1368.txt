This is a town built on stories , the more salacious the better . So This comes as not much of a surprise that the twilight of Sumner M. Redstone ’s epic career has become the stuff of    conversation , especially among those who knew the man when the man was perhaps the most powerful figure in Hollywood . Peter Bart , a former producer and film executive who served as the editor of Variety from 1989 to 2009 , was dining recently with friends at Off Vine , a quiet Hollywood restaurant housed in a      bungalow , when the inevitable came up . Others at the table included an    actress who knew Mr. Redstone well . " And they wondered , ‘ How could Sumner get Sumner into this situation ? ’ " Mr. Bart said . " It is very sad . " Details about the     tycoon ’s private life surfaced during a    lawsuit , which fizzled in court last week . The story that emerged fell somewhere between film noir at The story that emerged sleazy best and " King Lear . " Mr. Bart said the billionaire ’s plight was coming up a lot lately among    people . " In some cases , there were expressions of empathy , " he Mr. Bart . " But there is impatience with Sumner , too , that he Mr. Bart n’t keep his Mr. Bart life private . " The legal proceedings revealed an aging lion who craved sex and steak , although he Mr. Bart too ill to leave his Mr. Bart Park mansion and took his Mr. Bart through a feeding tube . Court papers described him Mr. Bart " a living ghost " and told of female escorts making visits to his Mr. Bart while a nurse sometimes looked on . As Mr. Redstone ’s former lover and onetime    caretaker , Manuela Herzer , 51 , battled his daughter , Shari Redstone , 62 , for control of his his care   —    not to mention what she saw as her she place in his his   —    this    melodrama had it all : wild shopping sprees ,       , whispers of a sex tape and , in a bit part , an angry    who seemed like a character out of a Coen brothers movie . Hollywood dynasties have long run into complications in the final reel . In the 1950s , a philandering Jack L. Warner undercut his a philandering Jack L. Warner Harry for control of the family ’s Warner Bros. studio , and the two never spoke again . In the early 1970s , Darryl F. Zanuck was ousted from 20th Century Fox in a coup , which his Darryl F. Zanuck orchestrated to avenge her his wife ’s treatment of their son . While those spectacles drew their those spectacles of press attention and loose talk , today ’s corporate , almost bloodless entertainment industry seems less tolerant of executives who depart from the script . Sure , the stereotype of the hardhearted ,    executive persists . But Mr. Redstone ’s eccentricities   —    he Mr. Redstone boasted that he Mr. Redstone poolside in the nude   —    and the recent disclosure of his Mr. Redstone exploits seem out of step with the airbrushed culture of    Los Angeles . " Sumner is caught in a time warp , " Mr. Mr. Redstone . The legal fracas has changed Mr. Redstone ’s public image from a firebrand whose business acumen and ruthlessness won him control Mr. Redstone Viacom , Paramount Pictures and CBS , a $ 40 billion empire , into something quite different . In the local parlance , he lost Mr. Redstone plot . The hubris that precedes a fall was evident in 2009 , when he told Mr. Redstone King , " I have no intention of ever retiring or of dying , " and once again in 2014 , when Mr. Redstone told The Hollywood Reporter , " I ’m not going to die . " Recent press attention has deflated such boasts . And secrets Mr. Redstone Mr. Redstone taken to the grave he reserved for Mr. Redstone in Massachusetts Mr. Redstone where he was born Mr. Redstone 1923 , became the stuff of Internet chatter when Ms. Herzer   —    whom he banished from Mr. Redstone Beverly Park Mr. Redstone last year   —    filed suit . " This is all very Shakespearean , with the family , all the people taking over the kingdom , " said Michael Medavoy , a producer who knows Mr. Redstone . " It ’s a tragedy . But my question is , is it a tragic It or is it a tragic It ? " After Judge David J. Cowan of Los Angeles County Superior Court tossed the case last Monday , Ms. Herzer filed a new lawsuit against Ms. Redstone . There is talk that Mr. Redstone ’s Ms. Redstone a suit , too , meaning the situation could drag on . Mr. Redstone has long been Ms. Redstone his volatility . Across the decades Ms. Redstone he has collected enemies the way Ms. Redstone in nearby Malibu pick up sea glass along Carbon Beach . The executives he has crossed include Tom Freston Ms. Redstone David Geffen , Mel Karmazin and Barry Diller . In 2006 , he split with Tom Cruise over Ms. Redstone actor ’s erratic behavior and stumping for Scientology , ending Mr. Cruise ’s production deal at Paramount . ( The star got some measure of revenge with his caustic ,     portrayal of Ms. Redstone character said to be based Mr. Medavoy    man , Ms. Redstone Mr. Medavoy said . " But those guys can be difficult . You have to look at it all in context . The great scions of industry , the guys who made a zillion dollars , are tough guys . Those folks do n’t make a lot of friends . " On a recent evening , Christine Peters was nursing a Moscow mule in the Tower Bar at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood , Calif. Ms. Peters , a movie producer , dated Mr. Redstone in the late 1990s and remained friends after he moved to the Beverly Park mansion in 2003 . She said she had not seen the    tycoon in two Christine Peters . Despite his position , Mr. Redstone was not Christine Peters creature Christine Peters the scene , she said . He avoided galas and opening nights , preferring Mr. Redstone at Dan Tana ’s , the dimly lit Christine Peters    Italian place Mr. Redstone Santa Monica Boulevard with    booths , waiters in black bow ties and bartenders in red    jackets . If she arrived late for a meal , Ms. Peters said , she would find him alone and impatient , drumming his Christine Peters on the table . Mr. Redstone , who was badly burned Ms. Peters a 1979   Italian fire in Boston , did   Italian like to show weakness , Ms. Peters said , and his closest personal relationships seemed transactional , rooted in business . But his devotion to his empire Ms. Peters not have given him Ms. Peters protection against hits taken in the recent imbroglio . " He Ms. Peters rather be Ms. Peters than humiliated and publicly embarrassed , Ms. Peters dignity lost , " Ms. Peters said . " Calling him Ms. Peters ‘ living ghost’ is the most hurtful , saying he Ms. Peters not make lucid decisions Ms. Peters ’s where the knife hits Ms. Peters for him . " She added that he regarded as Ms. Peters only worthy rival Rupert Murdoch , the     media king who recently married the Ms. Peters supermodel Jerry Hall . A Ms. Peters crowd gathered Ms. Peters the Vibrato Grill Jazz club here in the Bel Air neighborhood at 6 p. m. for Mr. Redstone ’s 92nd birthday celebration a year ago . It was one of his last public appearances . The guests included top executives in his employ , including Leslie Moonves of CBS , Philippe Dauman of Viacom Ms. Peters as well as Brad A small crowd Paramount .

" A figurine on the birthday cake was particularly telling Tony Bennett It Tony Bennett Mr. Redstone as a corporate titan in a suit and red tie , phone in one hand , television remote in the other A figurine on the birthday cake Next to the miniature Mr. Redstone on top of the cake was a tiny stock ticker that showed the prices of six major media companies , including Viacom and CBS . Mr. Redstone sat the birthday cake his caretaker at the time , Ms. Herzer , and his lover , Sydney Holland , Viacom Mr. Redstone CBS estate and has Mr. Redstone into his recent convoluted legal troubles . Mr. Redstone Mr. Redstone gave Ms. Holland some $ 70 million in Mr. Redstone and gifts before kicking her Mr. Redstone of his house in the days before he Mr. Redstone Ms. Herzer . Ms. Herzer party , both women wore evening dresses . The details of the Ms. Holland life Mr. Redstone would not have come to Mr. Redstone if Mr. Redstone ’s two paramours had not participated in a Vanity Fair profile of him in the June 2015 issue . Ms. Herzer was photographed for the Ms. Herzer a shimmering Mr. Redstone gown . Ms. Holland ’s glamour shot showed her on a chaise lounge in Mr. Redstone’s two paramours , Calif. Both gushed about the riches their benefactor had bestowed upon them , which did not sit well with Ms. Holland and a former convict named Ms. Holland Pilgrim , who was dating Ms. Holland at the time . Mr. Redstone Both hostile manner of conducting business and his tendency to go it alone may have also contributed to his    predicament . In a town where Ms. Holland and genuine Mr. Redstone often one and the same , his story Mr. Redstone become a cautionary tale . " More than one person Mr. Redstone said to me , ‘ I do n’t want to end up alone , at home and angry,’ " Mr. Redstone Janice Min , who oversees content for Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter . Hollywood The Hollywood Reporter a     approach More than one person Now , executives drive their kids to school . " On May 6 , an    videotaped Ms. Min was played in the courtroom so that the judge could make a determination on whether the media tycoon the    tycoon’s . Despite his speech difficulties executives Mr. Redstone used foul language to express his contempt for Ms. Herzer the    tycoon’s " I hate her , " he said Ms. Herzer , the    tycoon’s I want Manuela Ms. Herzer of my life .

" He has n’t softened into the    tycoon’s grandfatherly figure . " Further , she added : " He does n’t want a the    tycoon’s goodbye . Ms. Herzer is a ruthless negotiator the    tycoon’s the end . " At the Urth Caffé on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood on yet another cloudless morning , the patio was crowded with    huddled over bowls of coffee and plates of coconut cake . They were buzzing about their West Hollywood or the latest Hulu series . For this generation , a    macher like Mr. Redstone seems as alien as the original Hollywood bosses who built the world ’s most glamorous business on this    outpost .
