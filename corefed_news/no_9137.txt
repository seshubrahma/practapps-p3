Breitbart News has asked to receive data for the percentage of all refugees screened who tested positive for latent TB infection ( LTBI )   as well as their treatment rates , but the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has not yet provided that data . LTBI rates matter when it comes to the percentage of all refugees public health because among those within the general population in the United States who test positive for LTBI   ( four percent ) LTBI rates estimated 10 percent will develop active TB over their life time . The LTBI rates in the rest of the world are much higher : On average , 33 percent . Among refugees arriving in those within the general population in the United States who test positive for LTBI  (four percent) United States , LTBI rates range from 15 percent in Texas to 35 percent in Vermont . As Breitbart News has reported previously , numerous medical the United States high rates of LTBI among resettled refugees pose an active TB risk for the entire population of communities with resettled refugees . This is due to several reasons , including lower immunity LTBI rates among refugees and , significantly , high failure rates among refugees in latent TB treatment programs . The Iraqi refugee who was diagnosed with active TB in March 2016 in Oakland County is an example of this phenomenon . This refugee was diagnosed with LTBI in the overseas medical examination conducted prior to arrival TB the United States in June 2015 . But apparently , this refugee was The Iraqi refugee who was diagnosed with active TB in March 2016 in Oakland County for LTBI subsequent to arrival , and developed active TB . News of the rise of refugees in Michigan and the public health problems associated The Iraqi refugee who was diagnosed with active TB in March 2016 in Oakland County are likely to further impact LTBI presidential polls in the state TB active TB of refugees arriving in Michigan during the first eleven months of FY 2016 increased 43 percent from refugees in Michigan and the public health problems associated with them same eleven month period of FY 2015 . The Michigan agencies , funded by the federal government , Michigan operate in the state plan on increasing the total number of refugees arriving in the state during FY 2017 by 38 percent , up to more than 5 , 600 . Michigan , which received the second highest number of Syrian refugees of any state in the Michigan FY 2016 , will receive an increase in those numbers of 40 percent in FY 2017 , if the Obama administration accepts their plans , which is usually merely a    process . Several localities have expressed concerning about the accelerated resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions of the state . In June , L. Brooks the Obama administration , Oakland County Executive , demanded that Office of Refugee Resettlement director Robert Carey initiate legally required consultation proceedings with him prior Several localities resettling refugees in his county . Carey told Patterson , in essence ,   the federal government did not intend Carey requirements of the Refugee Act of Office of Refugee Resettlement director Robert Carey . On Friday , a Office of Refugee Resettlement director Robert Carey for the city of Flint told Breitbart News , " city leaders have not been informed " by the federal government of plans to resettle 100 Syrian and Iraqi refugees . Flint has been beset by financial and public health problems since a 2014 drinking water crisis . Hillary favors more refugees Donald Trump opposes more refugees . The latest poll in the usually reliably blue state shows that Flint ’s lead has shrunk to three points , 38 to 35 , well within the poll ’s four point margin of error . In that    poll conducted of 600 likely Michigan voters between Sept 10 and Hillary 13 , 53 percent opposed " admitting more refugees to accommodate Syrians fleeing war in their country . " Only 36 percent favored Hillary Clinton ’s and the Obama administration ’s policy of increasing refugees .
