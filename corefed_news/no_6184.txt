Greg Cote of the Miami Herald asks the question : ‘ What NFL team will be brave enough ( and smart enough ) to give Kaepernick a chance ? ’[The sports writer , therefore , implies that team owners who prefer signing players who respect the National Anthem and do n’t wear socks mocking police officers as pigs are cowards and stupid .    Incredibly , Greg Cote of the Miami Herald blames team owners for not hiring the " healthy "     quarterback " coming into not hiring the "healthy"    quarterback " physical prime , " who has " taken not hiring the "healthy"    quarterback " to a Super Bowl " because they team owners fear negative tweets from President Donald Trump . " What are teams afraid of ? " Greg Cote of the Miami Herald asks . " That the President Donald Trump might unleash one of his 3 a. m. President Donald Trump against whatever team signed him ? " Well President Donald Trump if it ’s not that then maybe it ’s " a it , brief backlash from fans who never understood that Kaepernick kneeling was far closer to patriotism than to treason ? "   What ? Reminiscent of George Orwell ’s 1984 , for Cote , refusing to stand for the National Anthem is really closer to patriotism than to treason . Does Cote also believe that Cote for the National Anthem is the National Anthem than it is to patriotism Cote Of course , Cote does n’t own Cote NFL team and will not have to sell season tickets . Nor , will he be concerned with such trivial an NFL team as making a profit or filling stadium seats . Obviously , he pays no attention to reports an NFL team as this one from CBS in October of 2016 : A fresh poll from Seton Hall surveyed 841 adults across the U. S. Each respondent was asked to identify seven separate factors as a reason for the NFL rating drop , allowing them to answer " yes " seven separate factors " no " for each of them . The leading factor , seven separate factors to the poll , was the national anthem protests , which scored " yes " at a rate of 56 percent . But , Cote says do n’t worry about that , because the " closer to patriotic " Kaepernick says he ’s done with kneeling during Kaepernick National Anthem . Interesting how he made that decision now that Kaepernick is effectively unemployed and looking Kaepernick another    dollar contract from a team that will give him a place on the bench Kaepernick the 2017 season and beyond . So , no more kneeling for Kaepernick now , but as a Kaepernick to any team owner " brave enough and smart enough " to sign him , you might want to Kaepernick his socks first .
