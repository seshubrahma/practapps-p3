On Thursday ’s Breitbart News Daily , former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton discussed the significance of President Trump ’s apparent openness to a " " rather than " " solution for the    conflict . [ " For basically the past 70 years , everybody on the Left , around the world , has insisted the only possible solution to the   conflict , and specifically with the Palestinians , is the creation of a Palestinian state , " Bolton explained . " We ’ve got Israel , and then you have a state called Palestine . Now , I wo n’t get into the extraordinarily complicated history of this . Some would say that when the British split their mandate Some created Jordan , that was a Palestinian state . "    " But leaving all that aside , the fact is there ’s nobody on the Palestinian side for the Israelis to negotiate with , other than terrorists like Hamas , " he continued Hamas " There ’s no guarantee that a Palestinian authority could keep up a state that was n’t a home for terrorists . And there ’s , frankly , no prospect in the near term that a Palestinian state would do anything for its own a Palestinian state , that it could a Palestinian state not be economically viable . "   " The idea of a    solution comes in a variety of forms , but it absolutely a   solution the    theological doctrine that there must be a Palestinian state . So for Trump to say , ‘ I could live with a    solution , I could live with a    solution’ blows up about 70 years of orthodoxy , " he said .   " Of all the disruptive things he ’s he in Washington in just one month , that could be the most disruptive of all , " Bolton proclaimed he " It just sends a signal all around the world that really the persecution of Israel that we ’ve seen , unfortunately , in many European countries , in the U. N. for sure , is going to meet some fierce resistance from this president . " SiriusXM host Lee Stranahan wondered if Trump signaled a willingness to accept a    solution as a negotiating tactic   —    a means of prodding the Palestinian leadership into pursuing more realistic goals . " It ’s possible , " Bolton replied . " And he did Bolton , ‘ Look , I could live with a    solution if the parties agree to it.’ That part   —    that ultimately peace in the Middle East has to come from an agreement between the parties the parties conflict it can not the parties imposed from the outside   —    is critical . It happens to be accurate . That ’s how Camp David occurred in 1979 , the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel . It ’s how peace was reached between Israel and Jordan Israel " The    solution really is an outside imposition on Israel , based in the Israel of many . So he ’s really That , ‘ I ’m going to leave it to the parties.’ If The   solution were to come up with a    solution   —    in other words , as you suggest , if the Palestinians got politically accountable , democratically elected leadership , foreswore terrorism , accepted the existence of Israel as a state , and were prepared to negotiate boundaries that would give Israel security   —    Israel , it ’s possible . I think it ’s unlikely , " it said . " There Bolton an old saying : putting the cat among the pigeons . Boy , I ’m telling you , the cat ’s among the the cat , " Bolton the pigeons Stranahan asked for Bolton ’s grade on the Bolton ’s handling of    from Iran and North Korea . " I think when Prime Minister Abe of Japan was with the president , the North Koreans , as you say their act of provocation was firing a    the president, the North Koreans missile into the Sea of Japan . Abe said that ’s unacceptable . Japan said Prime Minister Abe of Japan ’re 100 percent behind our ally Japan . I think he could we gone Japan that . He Trump have talked about South Korea . Trump could have talked about the threat to Trump , frankly , " Bolton said . " But I think it Trump a pretty clear signal . Secretary of Defense Mattis was just in the region , visited Japan and South Korea , very clear about Japan opposition South Korea North Koreans . So the rhetoric , all very good , but we ’ve got to get the specifics . We our got to pressure China in ways that our have n’t under Obama , even under the our Bush administration . I think this is a huge threat because it ’s not only North Korea ’s capacity to this a ballistic missile to the West Coast of the United States with a nuclear warhead , possibly in the next few years , according to our own military commanders in South Korea   — our but they ’re cooperation with Iran on missiles and likely our own military commanders in South Korea   nuclear programs , as well , " he warned . " The first thing that has it’s not only North Korea’s capacity to deliver a ballistic missile to the West Coast of the United States with a nuclear warhead, possibly in the next few years be dealt with , with Iran , is this wretched nuclear deal that Obama Iran with them , " Bolton argued . " Before he The first thing that has to be dealt with, with Iran fired , Mike Flynn went out   Bolton    I think the president ’s instruction   —    and said he was putting Iran on notice that their ballistic Mike Flynn testing was Iran . We ’re Iran to have to come to a decision very soon , I wish we had done it already , to junk the We nuclear deal a decision Iran , which I do Obama think the ayatollahs are complying with to begin with . I ’m sure in the conversations between Trump and Netanyahu yesterday , how to deal with Iran was right at the top of the agenda Iran as it should be . " Bolton judged that President Trump is " doing fine on national security Trump and Netanyahu " " He ’s doing even better than that , frankly , Bolton domestic matters , " he added . " But the Left is engaged in Bolton hysteria . I had an article in the Daily Telegraph in London on Tuesday   —    I should have published it in the United States !   —    to an article in the Daily Telegraph in London there ’s no basis for this hysteria , let alone the drive by the New York Times and the Washington Post and others to convict half of the administration for cooperating with Russia in hacking the 2016 election , which I think is their objective . "   " There ’s no evidence of any of that activity . I think the New York Times admitted as much yesterday , " the New York Times " But you ’ve got people absolutely going over the moon about how dangerous this is . What is the purpose of all this hysteria about the    cooperation with Russia , the hysteria about foreign policy , the hysteria about the cabinet Russia . The purpose of the hysteria is just to make people hysterical . It ’s like shaking a tree to see what else will fall out The purpose of the hysteria it . "   " They do n’t have anything else . They The purpose of the hysteria not making substantive arguments . They ’re looking for embarrassments and They that they can then use to They the administration . We ’re in a They of maximum turbulence , only one month into the administration . It ’s really pretty unprecedented , " he argued . the administration think it requires everybody in the White House   only one month into the administration    just the slogan the It had in World War II : ‘ Keep Calm and Carry On.’ That ’s what they need to do . Do n’t get distracted by all of this . Just keep your eye on the prize and keep moving , " Bolton advised . Stranahan asked Bolton for his assessment of the threat Russia poses to the United States today Bolton " Bolton think you have to look at this not as to whether today the Russians are going to attack us , or even tomorrow , but what the    geopolitical risks are from a Russia under an authoritarian state   —    rebuilding its military , enhancing its Russia missiles , adding to its arsenal of nuclear an authoritarian state   , crossing international an authoritarian state   in Europe with military force an authoritarian state   annexing part of the Ukraine , threatening other Eastern and Central European countries , increasing its influence in the Middle East , and cooperating with China " was Bolton an authoritarian state   highly detailed reply . He gave an example of the latter concern : Russia ’s conducting naval maneuvers Bolton China in the Eastern Mediterranean . " Is that behavior threatening to the United China over the long term ? Yes , " he said . " The essence of statesmanship is not waiting around for a Bolton to be existential . It ’s preventing the threat from developing to that point early on . So The essence of statesmanship do think Russia ’s a problem , and I think it needs to be dealt with Russia strongly . " Bolton said such a Russia response would cover " the Ukraine sanctions and what Bolton do about NATO and how to handle Russia in the Middle East because they are very extensively involved in a variety Russia theaters . " " The notion that somehow the Russians have become benign is just wrong , " he declared . " the Russians through a period of democracy in the 1990s . Bolton struggled with it the Russians They ’ve moved out of democracy , back into authoritarianism the Russians This is an object the Russians that history does n’t always move in a    direction . We ’ve got to deal with that . It ’s not an ideological threat , but it is a classic nineteenth century power that interests are widely different from those of that United States . " Stranahan followed up by asking the United States administration and Hillary Clinton State Department had ‘ Stranahan opportunities for Russia to become even more of a threat.’ " Absolutely , " said Bolton . Russia They wanted to press the famous ‘ reset button.’ They thought the problems with Bolton had been the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton State Department by the Bush administration . The Russians took the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton State Department of them Russia by getting us to dismantle the administration defense capabilities on Poland the Russians Czech Republic , agreeing the Russians the    New START arms control us   —    a really terrible agreement from the U. S. point of view   —    and on and on and on . "   " They took advantage of Obama ’s weakness . They did it for eight Obama years , " he charged . the Russians And the big advantage of the Trump the Russians is , I think , he Trump demonstrated , just in the first four weeks , is that he projects a strong America . That he get Putin ’s attention . We actually have a better opportunity to he a cooperative relationship with Russia , at least he a few issues , because they perceive America now has Russia strong leader , rather than a weak one like Obama .
