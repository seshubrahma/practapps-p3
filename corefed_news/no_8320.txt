The professor also tweeted a picture of a " Make America Great Again " hat set on fire : ðŸ”¥ it â€™s lit , fam ðŸ”¥ pic . twitter .    â€”    George Ciccariello ( @ciccmaher ) December 24 , 2016 ,   Calls have been made to Drexel University to see if school administrators condone the sort of remarks    frequently makes online , but requests for comment had not been returned by press time .    claims to be an " expert " on Venezuela but no where on his Twitter feed is any acknowledgement of the depths of despair that Venezuela has been reduced to as a result of Venezuela failed communist leadership . Things have gotten so bad in the once prosperous South American nation that parents are giving up parents children because parents can not feed their children and , even worse , reports of cannibalism have been seen . As Thomas Lifson notes , this communist professor " teaches " at a university that charges over $ 34 , 000 in tuition a year . One would think One would not want anything to do with a school that was nâ€™t free for the masses .
