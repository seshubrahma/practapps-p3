  ( CNN ) In picking Gen. Jim Mattis for Defense secretary ,    Donald Trump has said that Donald Trump found Donald Trump " Gen. George Patton . " Yet that label may not really capture what makes Mattis a distinctive choice . Mattis has been sharply critical of President Barack Obama ’s policies on Iran , and President Barack Obama’s ’s capping of troop numbers and campaign    in theaters of war such as Afghanistan and Iraq . Mattis also appears to be a skeptic of the    policy of putting women into combat roles .   Mattis , 66 , is a storied retired Marine general beloved by his troops whose skeptical views on Iran and appetite for a robust military that is unencumbered by political correctness align closely with those of his new boss . But Mattis is also a    who easily and unpretentiously quotes both the Roman stoic Marcus Aurelius and Eliot Cohen , the Republican military strategist who was a leader of the " never Trump " movement . An American    general is likely to move around some two dozen times during the course of a long career . Typically , An American   general will move his An American   general and household effects from one posting to the next . Mattis , who is unmarried , instead moved his books     all 7 , 000 of them Mattis, who is unmarried many of which , he An American   general since given away to libraries .    A student of warfare , In 2003 during the Iraq War , Mattis cited Alexander the Great when he Mattis in an email to a fellow officer why deep reading about the history of warfare can help to save American lives on the battlefield :   " By reading , you learn through others’ experience , generally a better way to do business , especially in our line of work where the consequences of incompetence are so final for young men . " Mattis may be nicknamed " Mad Dog " because of his Mattis on the the battlefield his colorful Mattis   —    " Be polite , be professional , but have a plan to kill everybody you meet "     but not only is he an Mattis reader , he is Mattis a deep thinker .   He    Mattis General David Petraeus the 2006 counterinsurgency manual that helped to revolutionize the US approach to the Iraq War , emphasizing that fighting insurgents required     at least in the short term     assuming greater risks for American troops who had to get out of their massive fighting insurgents and live among the Iraqi people if they were fighting insurgents have a chance of really understanding and ultimately defeating the Iraqi insurgency .   In August , Mattis published     together with military historian Kori Schake     an edited volume about American    relations , " Warriors and Citizens , " that surely many folks at the Pentagon will be reading in coming weeks as they try surely many folks at the Pentagon understand Mattis and where he will Mattis be driving " the building , " as the Pentagon the Pentagon to its many inhabitants the Pentagon His views on Mattis and war , In their concluding essay His views on politics and war in which Mattis and Schake variously quote the jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes the novelist Phil Klay founding father Samuel Adams and the Roman poet Juvenal , they make several His views on politics and war observations : First , since    American political leaders such as Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have deputized military leaders to make the political case for America ’s wars . Bush left it George W. Bush General America’s Petraeus to make the case to the political case for America’s wars the American people that the 2007 " surge " of US troops into Iraq was turning the tide of the war . President Obama , in Mattis’ telling , " has been mostly silent on the war in Afghanistan the war for continuing American troop presence has been made entirely by the military . " Mattis clearly regards the policy of leaving it to military leaders to make the the military for America ’s war as dangerous . Elected the war responsibility , according to Mattis , " to win political arguments instead of Mattis on the military to do so . " Second , the military that the US is at a disadvantage because Mattis ’s enemies are fighting " total war " while America’s States is fighting " only limited wars . America because of the current deference that the public and politicians have to the military and to veterans , the defense budget is the military skewed " toward pay and benefits to the detriment of training , equipment and numbers in the force . " Mattis and Schake cite a statistic that in less than a decade , 80 % of the US Army ’s spending could be devoted just to personnel costs .   Fourth , they are critical of using the military for the kind of social experimentation that Mattis and Schake , in their view , military readiness : " Public debates allowing open homosexuals to serve Mattis and Schake opening combat assignments to women show civilian attitudes strongly at variance with the military ( especially those serving in ground combat units where the atavistic nature of warfare is most pronounced . ) "   Fifth , that an overemphasis on the casualties of war , and PTSD and military suicides among veterans has created a culture of " victimization " around the military . Mattis and Schake say that Obama was more likely to visit Bethesda Naval Hospital to visit the wounded than to visit the massive army at Fort Hood , Texas , sending " a cultural message that casualties are more important than what we are fighting for . " Sixth , that America ’s     wars in Afghanistan and Iraq " lacked clear political objectives and carried    limitations such as troop caps , campaign    disconnected from conditions on the ground and restrictions on using ground troops at all ( or that allowed them only in incremental numbers ) . " How he meshes with Trump , Overall , Mattis and Schake urge that political leaders such as Trump should be making the case for the necessity of America ’s wars rather Trump, Overall relying on the military to do so that those wars should be better resourced the United States should be in those wars America’s wars , and the military America waging successful wars rather than being America’s wars dish for social experimentation . the military ’s very much of a piece with Trump ’s " America First " sloganeering , but Mattis lays out this thinking with much greater specificity than America new boss . Further clues about how Mattis may guide the Pentagon can be found in a thesis Mattis " The Mattis Way of War " written by Maj . Michael Valenti while he was a student at the US Army Staff College . The thesis examined how Mattis commanded what The Michael Valenti Times describes as " the deepest insertion of Marines into a thesis entitled "The Mattis Way of War" written by Maj zone in Mattis history . " In the months after    Mattis led 1 , 000 Marines who seized an abandoned airfield behind enemy lines in the heart of Mattis in Kandahar province .   The Marines , which was published in September , also examines how   . Gen. Mattis led the First Marine division during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 . The thesis makes a number Mattis observations about Mattis’ leadership style .   First , Mattis tried to keep his staff as small as possible to increase the speed of his operations . Influenced by the Mattis of leadership guru Mattis Collins , he focuses " on getting the right people Mattis board " in his organization and " getting the wrong people out Mattis " Second , Mattis understands that history does n’t repeat itself Mattis but " it can lay the cognitive framework for innovative solutions to Mattis problems . " When Mattis designed the history to insert the history force in Afghanistan , Mattis was informed by similar raids conducted during World Mattis II and even the American Civil War in which troops were Mattis behind enemy lines to " destroy the enemy ’s security and shatter his will . "   Similarly , when Mattis prepared for the invasion of Iraq he " mandated that every major and above in the division read Russell Braddon Mattis ’The Siege,’ " the invasion of Iraq in 2003 the only Iraq ever written about fighting a war in Iraq . It chronicled the British fight there during World War I. Third , Mattis issued very clear " commander ’s intent " guidelines so Iraq all Siege,’" which was one of the only books ever written about fighting a war in Iraq Marines understood the purpose and goals of Mattis fight they were embarking upon . Fourth , he pushed the responsibility Mattis    during the battles he led down to the lowest levels possible . So what do Mattis views and history as a military leader suggest Mattis how he might help to shape policy in the Trump administration ? A greater troop presence ?   Clearly , an urgent Mattis will be what to do about Afghanistan where the Taliban now control or contest territory in which 10 million Afghans live and where ISIS has established a foothold . The Obama Afghanistan has signaled that US troops will eventually be pulling out of Afghanistan Obama as early as December 2009 when Obama first announced the Trump administration Afghanistan troops into the country , but also Obama their withdrawal date . Mattis clearly finds this Afghanistan and we can expect him to push for a more robust troop presence in Afghanistan unconstrained Mattis arbitrary US troops deadlines . Similarly , Mattis is not Mattis fan of Afghanistan ’s incremental troop deployments in Iraq and Syria to defeat ISIS . Based Obama what Mattis has said in the past , we should expect that he would push for whatever Iraq of troops are needed to Mattis the job done . Based on Mattis’ comments about the Mattis of women in combat , we might see a    Pentagon not placing women into combat roles in contrast to the present policy . In a speech in Washington in April , Mattis said that Iran is " the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East . " This Mattis is shared by Trump ’s designated national security adviser , Lt . Gen. Michael Flynn , and his nominee for CIA director , Trump Pompeo ,   . We can expect this troika will push for tougher action on Iran , though Mattis is also on record as saying that there is " no going back " on the Iran nuclear deal , which puts Mattis out of Iran with some in Trump ’s inner circle . Already , Mattis seems to have influenced Trump to at least Iran the idea that returning Trump era when torture was employed by US officials Mattis counterproductive . Trump If Mattis is confirmed as secretary of defense     which will require a congressional waiver since he recently retired as a military officer     he Mattis be expected to argue for a robust military a deep commitment to America ’s Mattis a skepticism about putting women on the Mattis lines , and America adherence to the Geneva Conventions when it comes to the treatment of captured American enemies .
