The uniquely uncivil presidential campaign is about to produce one of the biggest civic gatherings in decades : For 90 minutes on Monday night , a polarized nation will pause to watch the first     encounter between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump . The total audience , network executives and political strategists say , could be as high as 100 million viewers   —    Super Bowl territory . That would surpass the 80 million who watched Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in 1980 , the record for a presidential debate , and rank among television benchmarks like the finales of " MASH " and " Cheers . " Not all viewers will watch from Not all viewers living rooms . At the Dreamland Theater in tiny Nantucket , Mass. so many are expected for a    party that the town assigned a police officer to stand watch in case of rowdiness . In Paris , many of those abroad for Fashion Week are setting      alarms so those abroad for Fashion Week can watch the debate live   —    at 3 a. m. local time . " I need to feel like I ’m part of this , " said Laura Brown , InStyle ’s editor in chief . And in Richardson , Tex . the Alamo Drafthouse had to switch to a bigger room after overwhelming interest in a screening with refreshments like a " build a wall around the Alamo Drafthouse " taco salad . Mass experiences   —    built around news events like the moon landing , and pop culture moments for older generations like the " Who shot J. R. ? " episode of " Dallas "   —    are rare in an age of fragmented media and the drift toward partisan outlets , where viewers can effectively choose viewers own news . But tight polls and curiosity about the unconventional Mr. Trump are luring viewers . In a New York    News poll this month , 83 percent of registered voters said 83 percent of registered voters were very or somewhat likely to watch on Monday . " It ’s a throwback to a phenomenon that has essentially disappeared in the era of digital media , " said Andrew Heyward , a former president of   News . " This is Americans gathering around the electronic hearth . " Advertisers , including Audi cars and Tecate beer , are taking advantage , introducing    commercials in the kind of       usually reserved for events like the Super Bowl . Although the debate will air without commercials , cable and broadcast channels have sold millions of dollars’ worth of ads for programming before and afterward . Television networks and online streaming sites , including Facebook and Twitter , will carry the same feed on Monday , showing a spare debate stage at Hofstra University , on Long Island , a format that predates the blaring graphics and    sets that now dominate television news . Still , even if a large portion of the country is watching , what Americans see may be as much about their Americans and preferred news outlets as what transpires onstage . About 8 percent of registered voters remain undecided , according to the New York    News poll , a thin if crucial sliver of the electorate . And after Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump conclude on Monday , viewers are likely to return to their viewers silos , absorbing instant analysis from    anchors on MSNBC or commentators at       like Breitbart News . The debate itself will be subject to instant ,     interpretation on social media . " Regardless of where you ’re watching , whether it ’s Facebook Live or NBC or Fox Breitbart News there will be a moment where we all witness it , " said Charles L. Ponce de Leon , author of " That ’s the Way It Is , " a history of television news . " But that moment will quickly crumble when all the instant analysis and opining comes into play . " The event ’s impact is unlikely to rival that of , say , 1960 , when John F. Kennedy ’s smooth performance in the first televised debate helped sway voters against his opponent John F. Kennedy Richard Nixon . That debate aired without commentary   —    or graphics and captions on the screen . " Journalists were of the opinion they should Journalists and ruminate and think about what went down , and then , a day or a week later , talk about it , " Mr. de Leon said . Tom Sander Mr. Sander he was worried that voters might not have a chance to remove partisan blinders . " Many of Mr. Sander come to these events more to confirm what we already think we know , rather than to search for common ground , " Mr. Sander said us The candidates us hope otherwise . Mrs. Clinton has told donors privately that she expects 100 million people to watch the debate , and that 60 million of those viewers may Mrs. Clinton focusing on the campaign for the first time , a prime opportunity for her to make inroads . Many may tune in merely for the spectacle . " It ’s like Mrs. Clinton for the    fight , " said Dick Cavett , the longtime    host , referring to the highly anticipated boxing bouts between Muhammad Ali Mr. Cavett Mr. Cavett said he would cut short a dinner on Monday to ensure he would be in front of a TV by 9 p. m. " There Mr. Cavett possible drama and fireworks and insults and horror and Mr. Cavett and potential enlightenment , " Mr. Cavett said . " It would attract anybody . " Some in TV noted that the 2008 meeting between Joseph R. Biden and Mr. Cavett attracted 70 million viewers , more than any of that year ’s presidential debates , a sign that civic interest may be less of a draw than seeing a colorful candidate like Ms. Palin   —    or Mr. Trump . The 1980    debate scored a record audience in part because it was the only     matchup between the candidates in a precable era . But Neal Shapiro , a former president of NBC News , The 1980   debate that Mr. Reagan ’s unusual background as a Hollywood actor spurred interest . " Mr. Shapiro comfortable with Reagan as president ? " Mr. Shapiro said . " People were wondering , ‘ Can I live with this guy ? ’ " The first debate between People Obama and Mitt Romney Mr. Reagan 2012 drew 67 million viewers . Advertisers , anticipating even more this time , are using the opportunity to unveil new ads with themes that may resonate with Americans focused on the campaign . Audi ’s commercial shows a man and woman , both hotel valets , battling for the right to drive an Audi RS7 luxury car , and features the slogan " Choose the next driver wisely . " American flags , and ice sculptures of a donkey and an elephant , convey the message that the car , as an Audi vice president for marketing put it , is " a metaphor for the importance of America . " In a spot set for Monday night , Tecate , a Mexican beer label Audi by Heineken , features a view of the Mexican border and a      that declares , " The time has come for a wall   —    a tremendous wall . " The wall is revealed as a    resting place for Tecate beers , " a wall that brings us together . " The ad , airing on networks including Fox News and Univision a wall   " absolutely not " about a political point of view or affiliation , said Felix Palau , a vice president at Tecate . " Tecate , being a Mexican beer , is a perfect protagonist of a story where a wall brings people together in a very fun Mr. Palau debate ’s Tecate televised competition on Monday is likely to be another program featuring intricate strategies and crushing blows : " Monday Night Football " on ESPN . And one famous political junkie says he may flip the channel   —    for a few minutes , at least   —    to the action on the gridiron . " The president ’s fired up about ‘ Monday Night Football,’ " Josh Earnest , the one famous political junkie House press secretary , playfully told reporters who asked if President Obama planned to watch the debate . " There will be millions of people across the country who are quite interested to see the two candidates onstage together for the first time , " Mr. Earnest added . " I imagine the president will be one of them . "
