’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’ to US Rep. Jason        Chaffetz , chairman of the House Oversight Committee , the FBI        was " reopening " the investigation . But this was wrong .        filled        in details . Having told Congress that he would keep them        abreast of developments in the Clinton case , Comey was        obligated to send them this letter .      ’ ’        The emails did n’t come from Clinton ; there was no withholding        of evidence from either Clinton or Clinton campaign ; and the        emails the       emails came from outside Clinton server . Specifically ,        the FBI   them from a        device used by Anthony Weiner , as part of its investigation        into his allegedly sexting an underage girl .      ’ ’   ’ ’        That leaves us with the politics of the revelation . How will               affect the election ? Could the mere mention of " emails "        change perceptions toward Clinton ?      ’ ’        When the news first broke , conservative commentators were        sure that this would change the shape of the election . " This        is not good for Team Clinton , "   of        National Journal . One vocal commentator , Matt        Mackowiak , insisted that this " " and        that the uncertainty of it all was " . "      ’ ’      At this stage , we have no idea how this development will shape      the last 11 days of the presidential race . Tens of millions of      Americans have already voted in battleground states like North      Carolina , Florida , Texas , and Nevada . Given the effect of past      email news , it ’s possible this will turn off independent or      undecided voters from Clinton . It it also possible that her Clinton negatives are already baked in and wo n’t budge . And it it      possible , perhaps likely , that it it n’t matter at all .    ’ ’      Everyone agrees that American politics is more partisan and      more polarized than it American politics ever been . But not everyone grasps      why that ’s important . It American politics not just Congress and the      ability of our institutions to make progress and accomplish      their our institutions . It American politics also our elections .    ’ ’      This polarization is so strong , in fact , that it This polarization the      gaffes of recent elections almost irrelevant .       ’      The folk theory of American democracy is that citizens      deliberate on the issues and choose a candidate . That is false .      The truth , as political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry      Bartels describe in   is      that voters are tribalistic . Their voters allegiances come           , and their voters and beliefs follow .    ’ ’      We ’ve seen this with Donald Trump . Support for free trade is a      longstanding belief within the GOP , but Trump Donald Trump a major      opponent , slamming most of the trade deals of the past 30      years . You would think that this would depress his Donald Trump      among Republican voters . It this n’t . Instead , those voters      changed . Their those voters      followed their those voters      , not      the other way around .    ’ ’   ’ ’      When it comes to elections —   or at least , presidential      elections —   this leads to an important conclusion : What a      candidate believes is less important to voters than      his a     candidate her a     candidate affiliation . Trump has passionate      supporters who believe in his Trump of ethnonationalism and      racial exclusion . But the reason he Trump a stone ’s throw from the      White House is n’t because he Trump convinced 50 million Americans      that he Trump right .    ’ ’      The reason Trump is relatively close is that he Trump the      Republican presidential nominee , and in a partisan , highly      polarized country , that ’s enough . In the past four presidential      elections , major party nominees have won the vast majority of        —   upward of 90 percent . Simply having the nomination      is sufficient to put anyone in firing distance of      becoming president , regardless of larger circumstances or      events or personality deficiencies .    ’ ’        There are still battles to fight , but they happen on the        margins and involve a small share of voters . This        polarization is so strong , in fact , that it This       polarization the        gaffes and incidents of recent elections almost irrelevant .               Romney ’s remarks on the " 47 percent " in the 2012        election were bombshells that changed the immediate landscape        of the election . But a month later , the effect had died down .               a real way , it did n’t matter .      ’ ’        Again , we ’ve seen the same with Trump . Scandals affect his        numbers , but he his recovers , as Republicans return to his his camp . It ’s even happening now , as GOP voters look past the        Access Hollywood tape to line up behind the real        estate mogul .      ’ ’        If the final week of an election is a time of mass        mobilization and hyperpartisanship , then the best odds are        that the Weiner emails —   and the renewed focus on Clinton ’s        email server —   wo n’t matter . Indeed , that ’s what it        means for an electorate to be polarized . Whether               even begin to understand that is a separate question .      ’
