WASHINGTON   —    One by one , the senators shuffled to the lectern on Wednesday , explaining the senators grimly , reflecting on the specter of mutually assured destruction and wondering aloud how the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch had delivered the institution to this moment . It was the eve of two seminal votes for the Capitol ’s upper chamber : an expected Democratic filibuster of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch Judge Neil M. Gorsuch Thursday and a likely rule change pushed by Republicans   —    the    nuclear option   —    to bypass the filibuster and confirm President Trump ’s selection with a simple majority vote . On a few points , at least , bipartisan consensus seemed to have congealed : This is terrible for the Senate . This This terrible for the country . And this This happening . Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona , spoke of the " further and perhaps irreparable damage it will do to the the Senate " Senator Lisa Murkowski , Republican of Alaska , suggested it was a trying time to be a lawmaker who prides herself " as one who believes in the traditions of the Senate . " the Senate E. Grassley , Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee , held forth wistfully on a bygone era in these halls . " We need to get back Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee " he said , " to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee comity that we ’ve had . " Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee these were the " yes the comity that we’ve had votes on the nuclear option . Yet as they have argued all week the comity that we’ve had from the moment Democrats secured the votes to block the nomination under current rules , Republicans insisted on Wednesday that they had no choice but Republicans pursue this course . " Democrats would filibuster Ruth Bader Ginsburg if President Trump nominated her , " the Republican President Trump leader , Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , said from the Senate floor . " We all know why . Democrats are bowing to    special interests that ca n’t get over the results of the election . " The minority party has framed its opposition differently . Democrats The minority party cited concerns over Judge Gorsuch ’s record on workers’ rights and his degree of independence from Gorsuch Trump , among other issues . They have also reminded the Democrats of the treatment last year of Judge Merrick B. Garland , President Barack Obama ’s nominee for the seat left vacant with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia . Republicans , led by Mr. McConnell , refused to even consider Judge Garland during a presidential Judge Merrick B. Garland Judge Merrick B. Garland " The truth is , each side can blame the other , " said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York Mr. Schumer blamed more . " We believe they ’re more in the wrong each side They Mr. Schumer we ’re more in each side wrong . The game of pointing fingers and     can go back and back the wrong to the very founding of the republic . " But the remedy , Mr. Schumer argued , was not to bulldoze longstanding rules and traditions it was to find a compromise nominee who could earn 60 votes . " If the majority leader breaks the rules tomorrow   —    and that ’s his choice , " Mr. Schumer began longstanding rules and traditions that Mr. McConnell would be " erasing the the majority leader shred Mr. Schumer in the Senate confirmation process . " the majority leader logged more speaking hours on Wednesday ( and Tuesday ) than Senator Jeff Merkley , Democrat of Oregon , who held the floor until midmorning after a more than    overnight     to protest the nomination . It was not technically a proper filibuster , as no Senate business was being delayed . But it was certainly a feat of congressional stamina and    content enhancement Senate with rousing flourishes , meandering detours and encouragement from his Democratic peers on social media . " I ’m here on the floor at 4:20 in the morning , " he said at one point , nearing 10 hours in , " because so much is at stake . his In his remarks , Mr. Merkley argued that Judge Gorsuch ’s rulings had disproportionately favored the privileged . He suggested his the Senate his confirm a lifetime appointee of Mr. Trump ’s amid investigations into ties between his president ’s orbit and Russia . He quoted George Washington and lamented creeping commercialism and an erosion of civic participation . Republicans have pointed to assorted his of Democratic escalation , including attempts to block judicial nominees under President George W. Bush and the party ’s choice in 2013 , when Democrats controlled the Senate , to bar filibusters on lower judgeships and executive branch nominees . Senator Tim Scott , Republican of South Carolina , said the week ’s events owed to the " physics of Mr. Scott an inevitable outgrowth of a rare partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court pick whom conservatives view as plainly qualified and uncontroversial . " For every action , there is an equal and opposite reaction , " Mr. Scott said . " An unprecedented action is going to provoke an unprecedented reaction . " Still , several lawmakers sought to present themselves as pained , fueling an unusual dynamic on Capitol Hill . At least a handful of Republicans predicted that their votes would damage the country and several lawmakers future of the judiciary , but described the alternative   —    letting Judge Gorsuch ’s nomination die   least a handful of Republicans    as even less palatable . " Now that we ’re entering into an era where a simple majority decides all judicial nominations , we will see more and more nominees from the extremes of both left and right , " Mr. McCain said . " I do not see how that will ensure a fair and impartial judiciary . " Republicans have vowed that Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed on Friday .
