I do n’t know how many he knows , he I went down to Orlando and Billy Graham ’s people asked to pray for me , and I was happy to do that , very gratified by that . Conservatives are hugely compassionate !

What more do you want ? Trump is massively    massively    he ’s    Trump huge cult gay following .

" " There are of course so many young people who got involved in the Trump campaign , they ’re on their , they ’re new their figures   …      We might not be like totally down with the gay thing , but we ’ll certainly We the rights of gay people to be protected from Muslims . I do n’t know who this guy ’s listening to . " " He ’s looking this guy the sort of gushing liberal feelings festival on the right that they indulge in after every tragedy on the left . Well there ’s a reason why we do n’t do it on the right , because we ’re actually we for solutions . We ’re not we to make people feel better , we ’re looking we the facts and how to stop it happening again the facts I ’m sorry if we ’re not we enough for this gay guy , I ’m sorry we ’m ’re we we to sit down and hold his hand and this gay guy " is this OK ? "   —    he ’s got this gay guy to do that , he ’s got this gay guy to do that . " " What people look for in conservative politicians is leadership , people who are actually going to get things done . People who understand numbers , who understand foreign policy , people who can run a government properly . That ’s what we like about conservatives . Conservatives Conservatives not there to sit down with you at the coffee table , to pat your head and   make you a cup of tea . I think he ’s looking Conservatives the wrong place for solace if he wants that Conservatives "
