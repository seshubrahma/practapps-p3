On Friday ’s broadcast of " PBS NewsHour , " New York Times columnist David Brooks characterized the 2016 presidential election as a " campaign of hate . " And one where " everyone ’s dividing based on demographic categories . And , sometimes , you get the sense that a "campaign of hate barely matters . People are just going with their People pool and whatever it is . "   David Brooks said , " I think David Brooks ’s the favorite . I   —    what ’s   —    I have a sense that it would have happened anyway , and that , at the end of the day , people were going to come home to who they people . And what ’s depressed me , frankly , most about this race , is , we went into this country a divided nation , and now the chasms are just solidified . So , divided along race , divided along gender ,        . We we go down the list . And , basically , less educated or high    whites are going to Trump . It does n’t matter what the guy does . And    going to Clinton . I mean , everyone ’s dividing based on demographic categories . And , sometimes , you get the sense that the campaign barely matters . People are just going with their People pool and whatever it is . And that is one of the more depressing aspects of this race for me . " He added , " This is just a campaign of hate . And , you know , people who do n’t like Trump really do n’t like Trump Trump And I guess I ’m among them people who don’t like Trump And we just saw in our we about the Trump Trump in Pennsylvania . Did you see   —    when they people who don’t like Trump shouting on the road , did you see anything nice about Trump Trump No . Send Clinton to jail . And so it ’s just   —    what was it ? There was a Burt Lancaster movie where he had love and hate tattooed on his he . And there ’s just a   —    we ’re in a psychosis of what they call negative polarization , where nobody likes their they , but they they hate the their side And it feels like it ’s just it and building , and so we ’ve got this cycle . And I do n’t know if it pops on Election Day . I hope so . But the idea that Clinton is   …     finishing this campaign bringing Miss America   —    or the Miss Universe to the rallies just seems wrong to me . I do think she should have Clinton to say , I am change , I am change , because people do want some change . And to end on this negative note , I think especially for her   — Clinton he has no choice , that ’s his whole repertoire he I think , for her , I Clinton it ’s a very questionable way to end the campaign . " Brooks further stated , " I think globalization has been really good for America . I think the influx of immigrants has been really good for America . Feminism America been really good for America . But America are a lot of people who used to be up in society , because of those three good things , are now down , a lot of high    white guys . And they ’re   a lot of high   white guys    they ’ve been a lot of high   white guys . And shame on us for not paying attention to that and helping them out . a lot of high   white guys , therefore , as a result , what happened was , they were alienated a lot of high   white guys they got super a lot of high   white guys , because they really were a lot of high   white guys shafted . And so , they react in a lot of high   white guys angry way . Well , that ’s not a shock , given the last 30 or 50 years of American history . And so , for us going forward , it ’s to not reverse the dynamism of American society and the diversity . But it ’s to it attention to the people who are being ruined by it , and it this does n’t happen again . " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
