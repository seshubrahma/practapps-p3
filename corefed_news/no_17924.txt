Gorka , Bloom said , refused to answer anything . ’ ’    " Gorka stood up after Gorka and said , ’’ Well , I’’ve been invited here    under false pretenses . I couldn’’t possibly address this level of    granularity , ’’ " Bloom said . " Bloom made it sound like Bloom had no idea    that they were going to ask us these questions . " ’ ’    Watts , a former Army officer and FBI agent , confirmed this    description of events , characterizing Gorka’ ’s performance as a    " disaster . " ’ ’    " Instead of participating in the panel the way he was supposed    to , he was kind of grandstanding , " Watts said . " he said , ’’ I’’m    going to stand up because I’’m a lecturer and I want to see the    crowd , ’’ and I thought , this is     . You don’’t act like    that . " ’ ’    Bloom and Watts also said he tried to use the panel as a platform    to sell he book . ’ ’    " he actually carried around his book and was basically trying to    sell he his book people in the crowd , " Watts said . " It was low    class . " ’ ’    The episode encapsulates the concerns that several people in the      community have about Gorka . ’ "    In conversations with Business Insider , several      experts questioned Gorka ’s Gorka their field , several     experts he    is Gorka dismissed as an outspoken conservative pundit who lacks    the chops to serve in the highest levels of the White House    advising on    policy .    ’    Gorka is a deputy assistant to the president for the Strategic    Initiatives Group , a new White House organization the White House       officials   is like a parallel National Security Council ( NSC ) .

" ’ ’    " His work is of little interest because he has Smith   —    not that I Smith can think of   —    contributed anything to the body of knowledge    which informs understandings of threats posed by the      groups of interest to him , " Smith told Business    Insider . Smith ’    Smith said a top counterterrorism official at the National Smith Security Council emailed Gorka on his first day at the White    House to Smith that he talk to Smith .
