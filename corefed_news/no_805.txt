" We will make it easier for the the Navy   plan for the future and thus to control costs and get the best deals for the taxpayer , " the President Trump . " The same boat for less money , the same ship for less money , the same airplanes for less money . " Ever the showman , Mr. Trump arrived on the carrier in dramatic style , landing on the flight deck aboard his helicopter , Mr. Trump One .

Mr. Trump marveled at the ship ’s Mr. Trump calling it " the ship acres of combat power and the ship U. S. territory , the likes of which there is nothing to compete .
