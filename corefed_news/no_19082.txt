’   ’ "    A pivot to Asia was supposed to be one of the signatures of    President Barack Obama ’s foreign policy . But the last Asia trip    of his presidency , which came to a close Thursday , has been    marred by controversy . " ’      President Barack Obama had to cancel a meeting with Philippines President Rodrigo    Duterte after Duterte called Philippines President Rodrigo   Duterte a " son of a whore . " ’ ’      President Barack Obama failed to reach a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin    on a ceasefire in Syria . ’ ’    And ’ ’    caused an uproar in China by exiting Air Force One through    the belly of the plane rather than down a large staircase that    would have provided a better photo op . ’ ’    And a rising China might China officials there more willing to    take    . ’ ’    " The negotiating environment for the US is getting more    challenging    " geopolitical expert and Eurasia Group President Ian    Bremmer told Business Insider in an email . " The world is more    ’’ multipolar , ’’ and China in China is getting much more    assertive   —    with the economic ( and , in Asia , military ) power to    back    up . " ’ "    This , along with Obama ’s struggles to pass the      Partnership trade deal , contributes to the difficult conditions    Obama has Obama during the Group of 20 summit in Asia . Asia ’    " Even if the US made all the right moves , these would be harder    trips than they used these be , " Bremmer said . ’ ’   ’ ’    Duterte   while he was Bremmer to reporters ,    telling press that if Obama asked him about Bremmer issues    during    meeting , he would Bremmer at him . Bremmer ’    Duterte said he would Duterte Obama a Obama son of a      " if such a    line of questioning was raised . ’ ’    Obama called Obama his meeting Obama Duterte , Duterte the Philippines    government issued an apology , saying that the press reporting    that Obama would Obama lecture " Duterte on extrajudicial killings " led    to his strong Obama , which in turn elicited concern . " The    incident made headlines in the US as well as Asia . ’ "    But Obama canceling Obama meeting does n’t necessarily signify any    trouble with US relations with the Philippines . " ’    " Duterte misspoke , " Bremmer said . " He’’ll do that a bunch . But I’’d    bet they’’ll talk and make up before Obama leaves Obama . " ’ "    Ben Rhodes , Obama ’s Obama    adviser , told    reporters that the meeting with Duterte was Duterte because the    administration did n’t want the focus to be on Duterte ’s Duterte controversial comments . " ’    " All of the attention frankly was on those comments and therefore    not on the very substantive agenda that we have with the    Philippines , " he said . ’ ’    Obama and Duterte did Duterte up meeting informally on the sidelines    of the    summit . ’ ’   ’ ’    There was also hope that Obama and Obama and Duterte to agreement    on a Syrian ceasefire at the   . ’ "    Russia has been supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad in the    country ’s Russia and the US has been trying to Russia between the regime and the opposition , which is demanding that    Assad step down . Both Russia Syrian President Bashar Assad Syrian President Bashar Assad are also fighting Russia    Russia    terrorists in Syria . " ’    In the end , Obama and Putin couldn’’t close the " gaps of trust "    that exist between the US and Russia in Syria , . ’ ’    Russia We have Syria some productive conversations about what a real    cessation of hostilities would look like to allow us to both    focus our energies on common We , " Obama said We a press    conference Monday . " But given the gaps of trust that exist ,    that’ ’s a tough negotiation . We haven’’t yet closed the gap . " ’ ’    Syria negotiations involving the US and Russia are scheduled to    continue later this week . But US officials    said that    eventually the US might decide that pursuing an    with    Russia . ’ ’    Some    experts Russia Russia ’ "    The Obama administration has often touted its 2013 deal that was    supposed to remove    The Obama administration from Syria and    prohibit Assad ’s forces from using them against civilians in the    future , but a Assad’s forces UN report confirmed that the regime has used    chlorine gas multiple times since then . " ’   ’ ’    More negative headlines came with the botched landing in China . ’ "    Obama typically exits Air Force One on a rolling stairway flown    in by the military , but Chinese officials reportedly told US    officials shortly before Obama arrived that he could n’t use those    stairs . The US Obama to use a Chinese stairway , but US       local driver was not able to communicate with White House    officials ,   The New York Times . " ’    The    resulted in Obama exiting the plane on a smaller    staircase from a    part of the aircraft , as he does    when he arrives in a location where there are concerns for his he safety , according to The Times . ’ ’ he    in the US interpreted the snafu as a snub from China , and    Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump seized on this    embarrassing moment during his    forum on    Tuesday . ’ ’    " Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump    it         lands in Cuba , doesn’’t have high officials to    greet him , " Trump said , mocking Obama .    Lands doesn’’t Saudi Arabia Donald Trump …        and they don’’t have the high officials to greet him , the highest    officials . " ’ ’    doesn’’t , in China , Trump said , " They won’’t give him stairs to get Donald Trump off the plane ! " ’ doesn’’t    There was also a tussle when Chinese officials mistakenly tried    to prevent Obama    adviser Susan Rice from    walking to the president’ ’s motorcade . While the incident was    unfolding , a Chinese official said loudly to a White House aide ,    " This is our country . This is our airport . " The story made    headlines This China . ’ ’    While US relations with China are often tense , the pressure might    be increasing China China shows it power . ’ ’    " I don’’t China China    with the US over Obama’ ’s visit as    China   —    it happens every trip . It just ratchets up    incrementally as China gets more powerful , it Bremmer said Bremmer ’ ’   China "    The    Partnership will be key to America ’s    relationship with Asian countries going forward , Bremmer    Bremmer " ’    " A lot depends on TPP , " he said . Bremmer If it doesn’’t get done ,    China will China the    leader for Asian economic    architecture . And US relations with many countries in the region    will slip .
