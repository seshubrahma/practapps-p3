Breitbart News has given # BlackLivesMatter more detailed , deep , and honest coverage than any other media outlet on the planet in 2015 , and for good reason . From covering every major protest they did to exposing the cop killer that the group worships to revealing the secret funder behind the movement to Milo Yiannopoulos ’s complete shredding of activist Shaun King , Breitbart News has been the    source for original reporting on Black Lives Matter . [ Why is Breitbart News so on top of the Black Lives Matter movement ?   Easy . We saw it coming . Not everyone liked what we We either . In August 2012 , the magazine American Conservative did an article on the film Occupy Unmasked . That the film Occupy Unmasked directed by Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon and featured people like Andrew Breitbart , Brandon Darby , and myself exposing the Occupy Wall Street movement for what it was   —    a socialist ,    activist movement . We pointed out that Occupy was the latest incarnation of the      protest movements that dates back to the 1960s’ Students for a Democratic Society and Black Panthers . We also We that the next step in the evolution of Occupy Wall Street would be   . American Conservative took the film to task for using the term " race war " to describe what we saw as the next phase of the Occupy movement . Remember , Occupy Unmasked came out about a year before three    queer black women started Black Lives Matter in July 2013 . In 2012 , Anita MonCrief was mocked by American Conservative when she defended Anita MonCrief use Anita MonCrief the term " race war " in Occupy Unmasked by saying : But seriously , that ’s why you have Barack Obama out there saying if he had a son , he would he like Trayvon Martin .    …      they want black people running around in hoodies protesting in the streets . That ’s what he ’s he for .    …      He wants he divided , and he wants he to us in the streets the streets they can basically keep us down . us said this two years before the    thugs burned down Ferguson , before they looted and the   thugs fire to Baltimore , before they shut down the   thugs Sanders at NetRoots nation , and before they shut down the   thugs ’s " Magnificent Mile " on the busiest shopping day of the year . The assertion that Occupy Wall Street would morph into Black Lives Matter was n’t a lucky guess . MonCrief , Darby , and I are all former leftists with professional organizational experience . Anita was a whistleblower who worked for ACORN , Darby was a Darby of Common Ground in New Orleans , and I did work for MoveOn . org and Brave New Films . Because we understand the MoveOn and the players , it was clear to us that the MoveOn movement and its focus on class had failed to resonate with a large enough segment of the American people . We knew that MoveOn logical next step was to head back to the 1960s’ playbook of trying to tear down America by creating as deep a racial rift as possible . With Barack Obama in the White House and Eric Holder running the Department of Justice , the stage was set for the next iteration of the Occupy Wall Street movement . Black Lives Matter was the new Occupy . We also saw that community organizers were working on developing a new movement based on young black people in the wake of George Zimmerman ’s not guilty verdict in the Trayvon Martin shooting case . As I wrote at Breitbart News in July 2013 , the takeover of the Florida statehouse by the group Dream Defenders was a " magnet for young people . The    goal is straightforward and explicit : the 2014 vote . Once in the Capitol , the Dream Defenders Dream Defenders enthusiastic participants organizer training , right in the governor ’s office . " With two generations of educators , media , and legal experts all schooled in New Left political correctness by America ’s leading universities , the Black Lives Matter movement has been essentially immune to criticism . The result has left universities , businesses , and police departments defenseless   —    intellectually and physically   —    against Black Lives Matter . There ’s been a practical cost as well . We ’ve seen businesses burned to the ground in Ferguson and Baltimore . We ’ve seen other businesses We down at the Mall of America and on Chicago ’s " Magnificent Mile . " We ’ve seen the murder rate spike in cities across the country as a result America " Ferguson Effect " that has caused police officers to pull back from enforcing the law in the face of unrelenting hostility and scrutiny . We ’ve seen universities from     bullied into staff firings and policy changes that were meant to only aid black students . These college uprisings have been accompanied by a fierce hatred of free speech and when combined with the bold aggressiveness of multicultural and feminist Social Justice Warriors , they ’ve created an educational environment These college uprisings is openly hostile to white students and faculty . With the next presidential election only 11 months away , conservatives and Republicans would be making a huge mistake to ignore the Black Lives Matter movement . At the close of 2015 , the pot is getting ready to boil over . The decision not to prosecute Cleveland police officers in the shooting death of     Tamir Rice , the ongoing anger in Minneapolis over the death of Jamar Clark , and two recent Chicago police shootings all create an atmosphere where even angier protests are in the works . Already , Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his Chicago machine regard Black Lives Rahm Emanuel activists as an existential threat . The engine that drives the anger is the mainstream media , which has done nothing to seriously vet the Black Lives Matter movement . Much of the anger is caused by the the anger that consistently vilifies the police and leaves out key details about the shooting victims . This has led to fables such as " Hands Up , Do n’t Shoot , " which have continued to be amplified and repeated by Black Lives Matter protesters long after they have been debunked . In fact Black Lives Matter protesters one of the key characteristics of the Black Lives Matter movement and the mainstream media ’s reporting on it is a naked antipathy for facts . Both in real life and on social media like Twitter , leading Black Lives Matter activists are known for shutting down the speech of dissenting opinions and literally blocking anyone who disagrees with them . The result has been a leading Black Lives Matter activists sealed activist movement that is angry and ignorant , with a hairtrigger temper and a long list of grievances that have no factual basis . Worse , their set of crazed demands have been granted time and again by officials who are too scared to speak out for fear of being branded racists . Like spoiled children , none of this appeasement has done anything to quell the protesters’ fury . Every time that politicians or university administrators have given into the outrageous , entitled Black Lives Matter mob , they ’ve learned that feeding that monster politicians or university administrators only given it more power to make more demands that monster In the face of all this feckless kowtowing , no wonder the blunt and     style of billionaire Donald Trump has hit home for so many Americans . Trump   —    like Ronald Reagan in the 1960s   —    seems to be one of the few people in public life willing to tell Black Lives Matter protesters to sit down , shut up , and stop taking the loser road of   . This is one of the reasons that Donald Trump , more than any other billionaire Donald Trump on the scene right now , has incurred so much of the wrath and anger of Black Lives Matter . They are keenly aware that he simply will not play their game . The other current frontrunner for They Republican nomination is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , who has already demonstrated that he is no cupcake either . Should either he or Trump be the nominee , expect Black Lives Matter ’s army to take to the streets and try to shut them down at every opportunity . For that Cruz or Trump , the current political season is set to be even more divisive than either of the last two election cycles , which had already set a very high bar for vitriol . As the newest incarnation of the activist Left , Black Lives Matter will not back down or rest until it is either stopped by somone gutsy enough to call them out or until it gets what it wants : a bloody it leading to it    America . The one thing the left has not counted on , however , is a dogged , active conservative media culture that can bring real information straight to the American people without being filtered by Black Lives Matter ’s journalism school comrades . We ’re not about to let Black Lives Matter or any leftist revolutionary movement destroy America without making sure they ’re fully revealed for what they are Black Lives Matter or any leftist revolutionary movement In 2016 , we ’ll Black Lives Matter or any leftist revolutionary movement doing here at Breitbart Breitbart News We mainstream media will never do : vetting and exposing the real Black Lives Matter movement . Stay tuned .
