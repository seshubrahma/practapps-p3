Last week in Washington D. C. at a discussion sponsored by the Raben Group , former senior advisor to President Barack Obama Valerie Jarrett spoke about President Donald Trump ’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord .   She said that decision meant President Donald Trump was " abdicating " America ’s role as both a " beacon of hope " and the leader of the world . Valerie Jarrett said , " It is unrefuted science that there are    consequences that are leading to the degradation of our planet . And it was unprecedented to have so many countries , nearly 200 countries from around the world , who followed the United States’ lead on this issue and came to the table and not just the government leaders but in our country , just hundreds and hundreds of large corporations signed on recognizing that it is not    to care about our climate it is not an either or , it it a both and an imperative . " She continued , " So I think it signals to the world that the United States is not serious about protecting our planet . Now , I do n’t know what other way to interpret a decision that I think could be as dramatically negatively impactful as that decision . And what it that decision is the rest of the the world move forward without us and our United the United States been that beacon of hope , the leader , the world leader , that ’s why we ’re called the our leader and we ’re basically abdicating our role , so that ’s disappointing to me .
