Wednesday on CNN ’s " Inside Politics , " network contributor Mary Katharine Ham said as a recent widow network contributor Mary Katharine Ham was " bothered " by those claiming the widow of Navy SEAL William " Ryan " Owens , Carryn Owens , was " only a political prop " at President Donald Trump ’s address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night .   Mary Katharine Ham said " I do n’t know Mrs. Owens but I was bothered by the suggestion that Mrs. Owens was only a political prop or Mrs. Owens was only exploited . And it seemed to take away the agency from this obviously very tough woman . I know many families of the fallen . I know Mrs. Owens and Mrs. Owens family know the price of freedom more than I ever will . I was also widowed in 2015 . He was not military , but I have two young children . Mrs. Owens was there of Mrs. Owens own volition . " " Mrs. Owens made a decision and Mrs. Owens very well may have been there because Mrs. Owens knew Mrs. Owens would stand up and Mrs. Owens husband , a hero , would get a hero ’s standing ovation , that the entire nation would know his name , that the president would be honoring his and the entire Congress and years from now Mrs. Owens can show that to Mrs. Owens children , as it should be , " Mrs. Owens continued . " And so I do n’t want to take that away from Mrs. Owens when we discuss this . Yes , this ’s a Washington event , but let we have that moment , let yourself have that moment , because it was really human , whether or not there were politicians involved . It was beautiful .
