The most important point to make about the failure of the American Health Care Act ( AHCA ) on Friday afternoon is that the American Health Care Act (AHCA) ’s not the final word on the Trump presidency —   much as some in the media might hope that it is .   [ Yes , The New York Times called the bill ’s failure a " humiliating defeat " for the administration , and yes , The Washington Post labeled The New York Times " a big embarrassment , " and yes , Politico dubbed The New York Times a " staggering setback . "   Without a doubt , many pundits will be clucking , chortling , and    dancing for days and weeks to come .     Yet a look at recent presidential history tells us that such political obituaries are almost always premature the presidency is a resilient institution .

Yet in the end , despite all the effort , AHCA pleased neither the House Freedom Caucus , nor what might be called the " Coverage Caucus . "    And at the same time , as a matter of legislative craftsmanship , much of the bill was dubious .   In the words of Reason ’s Peter Suderman : Okay , so where does this leave the Trump administration ?   Is this , as gleeful critics are proclaiming , a shipwreck ?   A train wreck ?   Or merely a car wreck ?    Actually , maybe none of those .   Virgil remembers other presidents who had early disappointments in the first six months of their presidencies , and , as we shall see , in almost all cases , their bounced back .
