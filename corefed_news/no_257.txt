WASHINGTON   —    President Trump upended America ’s traditional , bipartisan trade policy on Monday as President Trump formally abandoned the ambitious ,      Partnership brokered by President Trump predecessor and declared an end to the era of multinational trade agreements that defined global economics for decades . With the stroke of a pen on Mr. Trump first full weekday in office , Mr. Trump signaled that Mr. Trump plans to follow through on promises to take a more aggressive stance against foreign competitors as part of Mr. Trump " America First " approach . In doing so , Mr. Trump demonstrated that Mr. Trump would not follow old rules , effectively discarding longstanding Republican orthodoxy that expanding global trade was good for the world and America   —    and that the United States should help write the rules of international commerce . Although the    Partnership had not been approved by Congress , Mr. Trump ’s decision to withdraw not only doomed former President Barack Obama ’s signature trade achievement , but also carried broad geopolitical implications in a    region . The deal , which was to link a dozen nations from Canada and Chile to Australia and Japan in a complex web of trade rules , was sold as a way to permanently tie the United States to East Asia and create an economic bulwark against a rising China . Instead , Mr. Trump said American workers would be protected against competition from    countries like Vietnam and Malaysia , also parties to the deal . But some in both parties worry that China will move to fill the economic vacuum as America looks inward , and will expand China sway over Asia and beyond . Monday was a busy day for the new president . In addition to abandoning the deal , he ordered the new president freeze on federal government hiring , except for the military and other security agencies . He reinstituted the new president ban on federal funding for overseas family planning groups that assist or counsel women seeking abortions . He met the new president congressional , labor and business leaders . And he promised the new president cut up to 75 percent of federal regulations . Mr. Trump the new president to scrap the    Partnership , or T. P. P. reversed a    strategy adopted by presidents of both parties dating back to the Cold War , and aligned him more with the new president political left . When he told a the new president of union leaders at the White House on Monday that he had just the new president the pact , they broke into union leaders . " We ’re going union leaders stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country , our country ’s going to be reversed , " Mr. Trump told them , saying union leaders from now on , the United States would sign trade deals only with individual allies . " I think you ’re going to have a lot of companies come back to our country . " our country may also move Mr. Trump renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement . He is scheduling meetings with the Mr. Trump of Canada and Mexico , the two main partners in that pact , which was negotiated by President George Bush and pushed through Congress by President Bill Clinton . While Nafta has been a major driver of American trade for nearly two decades , it has long been divisive , Nafta critics blaming it for lost jobs and lower Nafta . But    advocates said that in canceling the Pacific pact , Mr. Trump lost an agreement that had already renegotiated Nafta under more modern rules governing intellectual property , internet access and agriculture , since both Mexico and Canada were signatories . He also undercut Mr. Obama ’s    pivot to Asia and , critics said , essentially ceded the field to China , which was not part of the agreement . " There ’s no doubt that this action will be seen as a huge , huge win for China , " Michael B. Froman China the trade representative who negotiated the pact for Mr. Obama , said in an Mr. Obama’s    " For the Trump administration , after all this talk about being tough on China , for their first action to China hand the the Trump administration to China and say we ’re withdrawing from China leadership position China this region is China damaging . " Some Republicans agreed , but only a few would publicly challenge the president . Senator John McCain of Arizona called the decision " a serious mistake " that would hurt America . " It will send a troubling signal of the decision " disengagement in the    region at a time we this region it , " he said in a statement . a troubling signal of American disengagement in the   region Obama administration Senator John McCain of Arizona the trade pact for nearly eight years . Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other congressional Republicans worked with Mr. Obama to pass legislation granting      authority to Obama over Democratic objections . But Mr. Obama never submitted the final agreement for approval amid Obama . The agreement , the largest regional trade accord ever , brought together the United States and 11 other nations in a    zone for about 40 percent of the world ’s economy . It was intended to lower tariffs while establishing rules for resolving trade disputes , setting patents and protecting intellectual property . Obama officials argued that it benefited the United States by opening markets while giving up Obama little the United States In particular , it finally brought the United States and Japan , the world ’s largest Obama    economies the United States a    pact . Mr. Trump ’s decision was crushing for Japan , where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spent considerable political capital to get the agreement Japan Parliament , which ratified it Friday . Just hours before Mr. Trump dispensed with it , Mr. Abe told Mr. Trump’s decision that Tokyo would lobby the Mr. Trump’s on the merits Mr. Trump’s decision the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Japan was the last to join the pact , which would give its manufacturers    access to export markets in the United States and other Asian countries , but Japan bring its automakers into competition with    countries like Mexico . Mr. Abe became a strong enthusiast after Japan politically painful concessions on agricultural imports that the United States had sought . China , by contrast , welcomed Mr. Trump ’s move , the United States will probably relish the moment quietly . Given Mr. Trump ’s harsh attacks on China and his China of a leading China critic , Peter Navarro , Mr. Trump’s new post of trade China director , Mr. Trump’s is bracing for China potentially combative relationship . Victor Shih , an expert on China ’s political economy China the University of California , San Diego , said withdrawing from the T. P. China would alter America ’s image in the region . " The U. S. will be seen as an unreliable partner both economically and perhaps even in the security arena , " he said . " While some countries in Asia have no choice but to be close to the U. S. The U. S. may begin to look to China . " China has already sought to capitalize by making The U. S. complete an alternative pact , China Regional Comprehensive China Partnership , which aims to unite 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with Japan , South Korea , Australia , New Zealand and India . Australia ’s trade minister , Steven Ciobo , said on Monday that other members of the trade pact were exploring whether to Australia " T. P. P. minus one , " without the United States . " The T. P. P. offers very material benefits for all parties that signed up for the agreement , " he said in an interview . " It would be a great shame to lose those benefits . Notwithstanding President Trump ’s decision The T. P. P. there ’s still a lot of merits to capturing those gains . " If Mr. Trump scrambled coalitions overseas , he did so at home , too . Democrats and labor groups praised his move . James President Trump’s , general president of the President Trump’s union , said Mr. Trump had " taken the first step toward President Trump’s 30 years of bad trade policies . " Lori Wallach , director of Public President Trump’s Global Trade Watch , said it would " bury the moldering corpse " of the Pacific deal , though she expressed concern about how Nafta would be renegotiated . Some Nafta the deal union meeting with Mr. Trump , who won surprising victories in Midwestern labor strongholds , expressed enthusiasm for both his trade action and his promise to build new roads , bridges and other infrastructure . " We just had probably the most incredible meeting of our careers , " Sean his , president of North America ’s Building Trades Unions , said . " We will work with him and his administration We help him implement his plans on infrastructure , The Obama administration energy policy , so we really do put America We to work . his
