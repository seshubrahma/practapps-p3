Politico reported Thursday that President Donald Trump , chastened by his experience pushing for the failed Ryancare bill , is moving forward on tax reform with is own economic team in the lead —   not Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) : [ Just on Thursday , President Donald Trump huddled with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn , senior strategist Steve Bannon ,     and consigliere Jared Kushner and staffers from the National Economic Council and Treasury to delve into the various policy    and ways to structure a plan . The key takeaway : The White House is not outsourcing these details to anyone , including the speaker of The White House . The report said White The White House secretary Sean Spicer confirmed this new dynamic at Friday ’s news briefing : " The president will put out principles , I ’m sure , in terms of what his goals The president and drive this as the process moves forward . "   A    paper , obtained by Politico and developed during the presidential transition , is the central blueprint for the president The president program —   and it would push Ryan the central blueprint for the president’s tax reform program own Border Adjustment Tax off the table . The president is expected The president cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent combined with a wiping out of the tax code ’s catalog of tax loopholes and deductions Congress created to ameliorate the 35 percent rate for business profits . Another part of the plan is to simply the individual tax rates , again by lowering the rates and removing specialized deductions . Trump ’s corporate and individual tax reforms are significant , but no way near the revolutionary changes contained in Ryan ’s Border Adjustment Tax , which shifts $ 1 trillion in annual tax burden onto exported goods and exporters .

In the end , the speaker pulled the Ryancare bill from the House a bill that might not pass the Senate , nearly 15 minutes from the roll call that would have meant its certain defeat . If Ryan had a a bill that might not pass the Senate majority in the House , he would be the man driving the agenda Ryan he but does not have that majority , Ryan the White House is a working majority in the House with its own the House own ideas .
