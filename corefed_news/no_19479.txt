’   ’ ’      Donald Trump won several states that had long    been Democratic , like   as well as swing    states , like Ohio and Florida , on Donald Trump way to a seemingly    improbable electoral victory earlier this month . ’ ’    Chris Arnade ,   who has spent the past four years    traveling the US to document the opioid crisis , was   surprised . After    traveling tens of thousands of miles in    communities    along the Rust Belt and elsewhere , Chris Arnade found one constant . ’ ’    " Wherever I saw strong addiction and strong drug use , " Arnade    told Business Insider , Chris Arnade saw support for Trump . ’ ’    Official voting data has suggested a similar correlation . Since    the November 8 election , Shannon Monnat , a rural sociologist and    demographer at Pennsylvania State University , has dug into the    results . Shannon Monnat, a rural sociologist and   demographer at Pennsylvania State University found that counties that voted more heavily for Trump than expected were closely correlated with counties that    experienced high rates of death caused by drugs , alcohol , and    suicide . ’ ’    Two other factors were strongly correlated with Trump    " overperformance , " Monnat found : the percentage of white voters    in the county and its Monnat on Monnat’ ’s " economic distress    index . " The index , which Monnat has used in her research for    years , combines the percentages of people who are in poverty ,    unemployed , disabled , in    families , living on public    assistance , or living without health insurance . ’ "    Monnat Monnat n’t surprised by the correlation . " ’    " I expected to see it Monnat when you think about the underlying    factors that lead to overdose or suicide , it’ ’s depression ,    despair , distress , and anxiety , " Monnat Monnat Business Insider .       That was the message that Trump was appealing to . ’ ’    " People are literally dying , " she added . " There was such a sense    of hopelessness that it makes sense they would vote for massive    change . " ’ ’   ’ ’    That correlation surfaced across the US , not just in areas of    heavy Trump support like Appalachia and the Rust Belt , Monnat    said . Even in counties with high mortality rates relating to    drugs , alcohol , and suicide that Trump Trump , he Trump    relative to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney . ’ ’ who has closely    followed the opioid crisis , noticed a similar phenomenon    unfolding on election night . Traditionally blue counties that she    knew to be hard hit by opioids were flipping to Trump Trump ’ ’    After " recovering from the shock , " she she comparing the      death rate with voter performance in critical    states such as Ohio , Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , and Michigan . ’ ’    What she she was striking . ’ ’    Six of the nine Ohio counties that flipped from Democrat to    Republican in 2016 logged overdose death rates far above the    national rate of . Nearly every Ohio Ohio with an overdose    death rate above 20 per 100 , 000 saw voting gains of 10 % or more    for Trump compared with Romney    drops of 10 % or more for    Hillary Clinton compared to President Barack Obama in 2012 . Only    Butler County , home to Miami University , and Hamilton County , the    jurisdiction for Cincinnati , did not conform to this pattern . ’ "      of 33 Pennsylvania counties with overdose death rates    above 20 per 100 , 000 conformed to the same pattern    flipped    from Democrat to Republican entirely . ( You can see Frydl ’s    . ) " ’    The phenomenon led Frydl Frydl dub such voters the " . " ’ "    The Economist found similar voting trends , though it   The Economist such as obesity , heavy drinking , and physical    activity , was the most accurate predictor of Trump ’s    outperformance of Romney . " "    Even in the Ohio counties that The The Economist to as    evidence of its analysis    —    Knox and Jefferson   —    the overdose    death statistics bear out . Jefferson County , whose margin of    victory for Trump was 30 percentage points higher than Romney ’s    compared with 14 points for Knox , according to The Economist , had    an    rate in 2015 of . Knox ’s Knox nearly half that , at 15 . 1 per    100 , 000 . " ’    Renowned statistician Nate Silver , the     of    FiveThirtyEight , argued on Twitter that education levels were    still the most accurate predictor of Trump voting trends and that    linking heroin deaths with voting was a " . " Many analysts have pointed to percentage of       white males as the leading predictor of    Trump performance . ’ ’    Frydl said , however , that there was a " sea of correlations "    uniting these communities across the US , noting overdose deaths    rates , mortality rates , education levels , and race , among others .    And while she said Frydl correlation does not equal causation , " the    characteristics can help analysts understand why Trump ’s campaign    had such appeal . ’ ’    Similarly , Monnat suggested that the rates of        and    mortality she looked into were not in and of    themselves enough to explain why voters gravitated toward Trump .    Rather , she said she they are voters reflective of the structural    problem . " ’ ’    These are communities that feel " marginalized " and " left behind "    by globalization and the larger economic structure that has taken    place over the past several decades , Monnat said . These are    communities that have lost   and   have seen their downtowns These for Walmarts    and    stores , and have seen . ’ ’    In these communities , it’ ’s not just about an economy that’ ’s    failing them , These said , but how the very structure of their    These has changed , for both rich and poor . Social networks    have become " broken " and people feel " humiliated , " he said Arnade ’ ’   ’ ’    The coming of the opioid crisis in the Rust Belt and Appalachia    felt a lot like the economic problems that preceded it   —      something over which its residents      no control . ’ ’    People were unprepared for the opioid crisis and , " what’ ’s more ,    believed they had People nothing to deserve it , "   wrote on his blog    Monday . Quinones investigated the causes of the opioid crisis    extensively in his 2015 Quinones , " . " ’ ’    " The effects of opioid addiction ripple out far beyond addicts to    affect    communities , " Quinones wrote Quinones killing their    " buoyancy of spirit " and leaving them open their the " foreboding    that    to motivate many voters . " ’ ’    In an interview with the Columbia Journalism Review , Arnade    " community    that he visited : Prestonsburg , Kentucky , a coal town of 3 , 500    residents , most of them white Prestonsburg, Kentucky, a coal town of 3, 500   residents Here’ ’s how he described Here’ turn Here’ toward Trump Trump ’ ’    Trump’ ’s attack on immigration and globalization was the perfect    "   punch " in a place like Prestonsburg , Arnade said Arnade It    " punches downward " by scapegoating others , like immigrants and    minorities , and upward at what the working class views as a    " rigged system " pushed by politicians with " fancy educations . " ’ ’    But Arnade said Arnade was Arnade easy to vilify such voters as " racist    and stupid , " even if Trump’ ’s racial appeals may have resonated .    Many    Trump in those communities , he said Arnade voted for Obama President Barack Obama were voting " to kick over the system . " ’ ’    Frydl described the movement from economic decline to opioid    crisis to Trump Trump as " a nested chain of causality , " wherein    the anchor is the loss of industry and economy in the Rust Belt    and Appalachia Appalachia ’ ’    Frydl too saw the Trump Trump in such areas as a vote against the    status quo in the same way that a vote for Obama was President Barack Obama 2008 . In    that way , she thinks Trump’ ’s upset Trump’ a " de facto " judgment on    Obama’ ’s failure to be the " change agent " many thought they were    voting for . ’ ’    " The people in Pennsylvania , Ohio , and the steel belt that voted    for Trump Trump aware that the steel mills closed in 1983 , " she    said . " They were aware The people in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the steel belt that voted   for Trump that in 2012 when they voted for The people in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the steel belt that voted   for Trump . President Barack Obama There is    specific to the opioid crisis the opioid crisis four    years that is a social policy failure that deserves to be treated    as discrete . " ’ ’    Frydl , who has written   believes that the Obama    President Barack Obama response to the opioid crisis signaled to many the opioid crisis " their suffering was not registering    with the the Obama   administration Party establishment . " ’ "    The administration ’s landmark   the Comprehensive Addiction the Obama   administration Act , was    seen as modest , at best . Attorney General Eric Holder failed to    hold Purdue Pharma , widely considered to be    main source for    opioid overprescribing in the 1990s and 2000s ,    other    pharmaceutical companies to account for their part in the crisis ,    Frydl said   opioid overprescribing in the 1990s and 2000s, or other   pharmaceutical companies And the opioid crisis the government cracked    on legal    prescription drugs ,   and   flooded in to meet demand . " "    After decades of systemic economic decline and the government ’s    failure to address the subsequent    the government Trump Trump    outsider campaign was perfectly primed to capitalize on the      Oxy electorate ’s fears about foreign influence and loss    of status . " ’    " I’’m not sure why we didn’’t think it would impact the    presidential election , " Monnat said . " Monnat ’s finally come it’ bear ,    and we’’re going to have to deal with the repercussions of that . " ’
