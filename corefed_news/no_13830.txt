  ( CNN )   Donald Trump ’s feud with the intelligence community is taking on surreal overtones just over two weeks before Donald Trump inauguration , raising the potential of unusual tension with the nation ’s top spies when Donald Trump moves into the White House .   Unless Donald Trump changes course , Donald Trump will take office having invested more credibility in the views of Russian President Vladimir Putin and WikiLeaks fugitive Julian Assange than in leading US intelligence agencies .   Donald Trump dismissal of assessments by US analysts that Russia meddled in November ’s election has already soured Donald Trump ties with America ’s leading espionage agencies . But Donald Trump move Wednesday to invoke Assange , who has spilled some of Russia ’s most closely held secrets , to raise questions about Russia Russia in American politics could poison Donald Trump relations with     intelligence operatives along with some leading Republicans on Capitol Hill . Trump defended himself Thursday Trump tweeting : " The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange    wrong . I simply state what he states Trump it is for the people . ... to make up their own the people as to the truth . The media lies to make it look like I am against " Intelligence " when in fact I am a big fan ! But the clash is ultimately a battle of wits between Trump , who never likes to admit he is wrong , and intelligence agencies that insist they have the clash evidence to back up their conclusions the clash the Kremlin ’s alleged election operation . The confrontation , and the political divisions it has opened , will be center stage on Thursday when Sen. John McCain presides over a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on foreign cyber hacking that will include testimony from the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper .   Trump in 2010 : WikiLeaks ’disgraceful’   " This is a power struggle like we have CNN seen before between an incoming president and the intelligence community , " Rod Beckstrom , former head of the National Cybersecurity Center , told CNN ’s Brooke Baldwin Wednesday on " Newsroom . " " In this case , Trump is Trump in 2010: WikiLeaks ’disgraceful’   very clear from day one , ’I am the leader here , sit down and listen to me.’ He ’s Trump in 2010: WikiLeaks ’disgraceful’   the ( intelligence community ) in an extremely difficult position . " Extraordinary decision , Trump ’s Trump in 2010: WikiLeaks ’disgraceful’   cite Assange was extraordinary .   While he is viewed Trump in 2010: WikiLeaks ’disgraceful’   some quarters of the world as a heroic whistleblower , Assange is wanted Assange Washington over the publication of hundreds of thousands of documents related to the Iraq War and classified embassy cables . Some US officials believe his disclosures endangered US troops serving the field . He has holed his in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 and returned to prominence Tuesday evening when an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity     one of Trump ’s biggest media backers     aired . Assange ’s entire philosophy is to undermine US and allied governments . That ’s what makes it so stunning that an incoming American president would go out of his way to an incoming American president him as a an incoming American president source .   Trump could hardly Trump cited a more radioactive figure had he been intending Trump insult US intelligence and State Department personnel who were left to deal with the fallout of one of the biggest leaks of classified intelligence ever . " It ’s a sad day when politicians place more stock in Vladimir Putin and Julian Assange than in the Americans who risk their lives daily politicians provide objective    intelligence analysis , " one US intelligence official told CNN . Those views are shared by many Republicans . " In Julian Assange ’s world , we ’re the bad guys , " South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN Wednesday . CNN Not the Iranians , not the Russians , not the North Koreans . " He added : South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham You ’ve got to remember who this guy is . " Trump attacks set intelligence community on edge , Trump ’s series of tweets on WikiLeaks were not his only new WikiLeaks at US spy chiefs . On Tuesday , he complained that WikiLeaks scheduled briefing he had requested WikiLeaks the alleged Russian hacking had been delayed until Friday . " Perhaps more time needed to build a case . Very strange ! " Trump tweeted .   Intelligence agency chiefs said the meeting with CIA Director John Brennan and James Clapper , the director of National Intelligence , was never due to take place before Friday . Disconnect Friday The feud is already raising questions about how far the disconnect between the next president and the intelligence community     which is at the fulcrum of everything the US government does in the world     could harm US security . " Let ’s stare this reality square in the face : PEOTUS is    and believes Julian Assange over the @CIA . On Jan. 20 we will be less safe , " said George Little , a former CIA spokesman , on Twitter . Rep. Adam Schiff , the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , said Trump ’s statements were alarming . " That he would now cite people like Assange who have demonstrated universal hostility to the United States and its interests takes the United States into new he even more treacherous territory , " he said in he statement . " With every conspiracy    tweet and erratic     comment , the    does damage to our national security , while raising new concerns about his capacity to he into the job . " Former House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers , a Republican who is now a CNN analyst , said Trump needed to undergo a " maturation process . " " He is going he need the CIA and the CIA is going to need him , " he told CNN he Jim CNN on " The Lead . " Aides on Capitol Hill say GOP lawmakers are privately expressing disbelief and incredulity at Trump ’s continued Trump on believing Russia over the US intelligence community . Everything they have seen points to Russian responsibility for    activity , the aides say , and add that Republicans hope Trump comes around Trump   WikiLeaks’ Assange : Russia did n’t Russia us emails   The estrangement between Trump and the Trump other agencies represents an unorthodox strategy     even for Trump . One theory Trump might explain his behavior is his extreme sensitivity to his suggestion that his November election triumph his not legitimate . He appears to view his about Russia ’s role through that prism , and his aides have repeatedly his to spin such talk as a Democratic plot to undermine him . Some intelligence his officials believe that Trump ’s hostility might be based on a misunderstanding . " The intelligence community is not saying that Vladimir Putin won the election for Trump , " one Trump’s told CNN on Wednesday . " We ’re saying they did a series of things to sow doubt and some people think they wanted Trump to they , Trump’s no one has ever said they got into the they of the ballot boxes . " If it lingers , the bad feeling between the    and the spies he will soon command could also have a corrosive impact on the analysts and agents who do America ’s most secret work . There will be fears for morale , especially among those who serve in covert missions in hostile foreign theaters with only a promise of a star on the CIA ’s Memorial Wall if they are killed . CNN Intelligence Analyst Phil Mudd , who worked in    for the CIA , warned the CIA’s risked badly damaging his credibility . " Who Trump a management relationship dissing the entire workforce before they even meet not only the entire workforce workforce but talk to the leadership of the workforce ? " Mudd asked .
