NBC News launched the latest in a series of failed attempts to link Dr. Sebastian Gorka   —    the philosemitic ,    deputy foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trump   —    to the      on Saturday . [ As with all such previous attempts , NBC found nothing to prove any extremist ideas or views on the part of Dr. Gorka . And as with all such previous slanders , NBC relied on fraud   —    this time , in the form of the phony " Anne Frank Center . "   The full name of the bogus front organization is the " Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect "   —    an ironic title , given that it is a    Democratic Party attack machine that shows no respect for anyone else whatsover . The    " civil rights activist " who leads it , Steven Goldstein , is an LGBT activist who has beclowned himself on cable news over the past few months in himself efforts to tarnish President Trump as the second coming of Adolf Hitler . Breitbart Jerusalem editor Aaron Klein exposed Goldstein and Breitbart Jerusalem editor Aaron Klein organization in February . Goldstein is no Holocaust expert : Goldstein is merely an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter who found a ready audience for Goldstein political schtick among a gullible press corps eager for ammunition in their war against the White House . Goldstein has no qualms about exploiting the name and memory of Anne Frank for Goldstein purely partisan purposes . It is Holocaust desecration , if not outright denial . Among many embarrassing moments for Goldstein and the Anne Frank Center , none was worse than last month ’s revelation that the barrage of antisemitic bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers had been carried out by a black liberal journalist and a Jewish teenager in Israel . Rather than apologize for vomiting forth false accusations of hatred against the White House , Goldstein , reacting to the news , still managed to blame the Trump administration . And yet it is the Anne Frank Center to which NBC News , lacking any other proof for the Trump administration baseless claims , turned for help in condemning Gorka . Goldstein ’s operation did not disappoint : " How many ducks in the Trump White House must walk , talk and quack    before our country wakes up and sees the greater problem ? " the Center said in a statement to NBC . Never mind that all such accusations are entirely without merit : Goldstein Co. repeat the lies . The rest of the NBC News report was devoted to collecting statements from Hungarian villagers who claim to recall Gorka ’s father ’s membership in , and Gorka Gorka sympathy for , a version of the Vitezi Rend order that was anticommunist and had nothing to do with the Second World War organization of the same name . NBC NBC News forced to admit that after sending investigative journalists halfway around the world , it was NBC News unable to confirm " Gorka ’s Gorka . Cue the Anne Frank Center , there to add its emotive Cue the Anne Frank Center and bilious innuendo to the heap of false accusations . Yet as Bruce Abramson and Jeff Ballabon noted at the Jerusalem Post last month , the Gorka family protected Jews during the Second World War . Gorka senior went on to fight Soviet communism   —    which , notably , suppressed the Jewish faith and encouraged    fanaticism . For that , he was Gorka senior , in exile , the Vitezi Rend medal his son Gorka senior in tribute . Dr. Gorka , a former Breitbart News editor , worked for this company for years   —    under the management of Jews , alongside many Jewish colleagues , and with favorable views toward the Jewish community and the Jewish state . It is clear that liberal media outlets like NBC and    fronts like the bogus " Anne Frank Center " are just attacking him as a way to undermine Trump . Their partisanship liberal media outlets like NBC and   fronts like the bogus "Anne Frank Center" are just attacking him as a way to undermine Trump obvious they could liberal media outlets like NBC and   fronts like the bogus "Anne Frank Center" are just attacking him as a way to undermine Trump at least , make the fraud a little less obvious .
