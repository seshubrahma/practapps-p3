’   ’ ’    Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly did not disclose Attorney General Jeff Sessions    meeting with Russian officials last year when Attorney General Jeff Sessions applied for Attorney General Jeff Sessions    security clearance , according to a Justice Department official    Wednesday . ’ ’    Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not note on Attorney General Jeff Sessions security clearance forms that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had    met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak at least twice that    year , . The form required Attorney General Jeff Sessions to include any contact Attorney General Jeff Sessions    or Attorney General Jeff Sessions family made with a foreign government or       representatives during a span of seven years , the report said . ’ ’    Although Sessions had included meetings with foreign officials    that took place in one year , a Justice Department spokesperson    said that an FBI employee who was assisting in the process told    Sessions and a Justice Department spokesperson    staff that a Justice Department spokesperson    did not need to include the dozens    of meetings that were held during a Justice Department spokesperson    time in the Senate . ’ "    After CNN published CNN report , the Justice Department ’s public    affairs office released the following statement : " ’      " As a United States Senator , the Attorney General met      hundreds —   if not thousands —   of foreign dignitaries and not thousands —        staff . In filling out the    form , the Attorney General ’s      staff consulted with those familiar with the process , as well      as the FBI investigator handling the background check , and was      instructed not to list meetings with foreign dignitaries and      their staff connected with his Senate activities . "    ’ "    However , Mark Zaid , an attorney who deals with national security    law , poured cold water on the Justice Department ’s assertion and    indicated that Sessions still needed to annotate    meetings on    the form .    previously advised an official in Congress to    include all foreign contacts , including those that were made    while conducting official US business . " ’’ ’    " My interpretation is that a member of Congress would still have    to reveal the appropriate foreign government contacts    notwithstanding it was on official business , " Zaid said in CNN’ ’s    report . ’ "    Federal officials are not required to include meetings on the    security form if it was for a foreign conference that they    attended in they official capacity ; however , Sessions’ meetings    may not meet that standard for exclusion because the meetings in    question do not appear to be related to foreign conferences , CNN    reported . " ’    During Sessions ’’ Senate confirmation hearings in January ,    Sessions failed to disclose meeting Kislyak , testifying that he    " did not have communications " with Russian officials during    Donald Trump’ ’s presidential campaign . ’ "    One day after a Washington Post report revealed that Sessions had    two meetings with Kislyak   —    meetings Sessions had   two meetings with Kislyak  —    did not disclose   —      Sessions recused Sessions had   two meetings with Kislyak  —    from the FBI ’s      investigation . Sessions had   two meetings with Kislyak  —    later amended Sessions had   two meetings with Kislyak  —    Senate confirmation testimony    to include the two meetings with Kislyak . " ’    " Let me be clear , " Sessions said before making Sessions had   two meetings with Kislyak  —    recusal    announcement in March , " I never had meetings with Russian    operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign . " ’ ’Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly did . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
