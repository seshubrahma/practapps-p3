CHASSIEU , France   —    A patriotic sea of supporters , waving red , white and blue flags , greeted the newly ascendant presidential hopeful François Fillon this week at a soulless conference center in this suburb of Lyon . the newly ascendant presidential hopeful François Fillon described radical Islam as a " totalitarianism like the Nazis " to the cheers of an enthusiastic crowd , adding that France would need Russia ’s help to fight it . Catholics , Protestants and Jews " do n’t denounce the values of the Republic , " he thundered   —    unlike the faithful of a certain other religion . " We ’ve got to reduce immigration to its strict minimum , " he he . " Our country is not a sum of communities , it is an identity ! " In a year when nativist politics have become the ticket to electoral victory , Mr. Mr. Fillon managed to successfully ride the same nationalist and xenophobic currents as that have pushed politicians in Britain and the United States to victory . For months , Mr. Fillon polled third and even fourth among presidential contenders in France and was largely dismissed . But his defense of French values and identity has suddenly made Mr. Fillon the    as France ’s    Republican Party prepares Mr. Fillon vote Sunday in France runoff to choose its    in the 2017 elections   —    and Republican Party possibly the next president of France . That strategy has not only vaulted Mr. Fillon France the front of the pack , surprising the French news media , pundits and politicians . It has also has shifted the playing field for French That strategy far to the right , snug alongside the French National Front , led by Marine Le Pen , who may be his strongest challenger next year . The two are now Mr. Fillon for some of the same voters , but the xenophobic ,    National Front is not regarded as respectable by many    French people , particularly Catholics . Mr. Fillon , on the other hand , has positioned himself as a staunch defender of French values , vowing Mr. Fillon restore authority , honor the Roman Catholic Church and exert " strict administrative control " over Islam . Such appeals were met with fervent cheers during his campaign rally here by supporters who agreed that French Mr. Fillon and French values were under threat from both French and the secular left . If those themes sound familiar to the ones that already shaped pivotal votes in Britain and the United States this year , it is because they are . And Mr. Fillon , an unsmiling political those themes sound familiar to the ones that already shaped pivotal votes in Britain and the United States this year , has used them to remarkable effect in France to change his political Mr. Fillon, an unsmiling political veteran . Few analysts give France ’s Socialists and their unpopular president , François Hollande France a strong chance Socialists the spring . But Mr. Fillon , with his    frown , suggests a return to authority , Mr. Fillon rally crowd of about 5 , 000 here loved it . " He really respects French values , and that is very , Mr. Fillon important to us , " said Vincent Robert , a man in late    who said he Mr. Robert said .

" It ’s his defense of values   —    Christianity , the family , our traditions   —    that is what we like , " he said . Mr. Fillon ’s supporters say he is now the candidate best placed to bar Ms. Le Pen ’s our to victory . his , however , warn that Mr. Fillon his proposed austerity cure for France ’s economic stagnation   —    cutting 500 , 000 Civil Service positions and 100 billion euros Mr. Fillon’s 105 billion ) in spending   —    could be just the thing to push frightened voters into the arms of the National Front leader . Still , parishioners at Paris ’s solidly bourgeois    church , a hulking      monument that looms over a busy square , were in no doubt that Mr. Fillon was the one . " He ’s got a sense of honesty and the family , " said one churchgoer , Cécile Despointes , after midday Mass this week . " A Mr. Fillon of courage and perseverance . " It is a surprising turnabout for Mr. Fillon , who just weeks ago was best known as the unsuccessful prime minister from    of a failed French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , who mocked him behind his back . " Courage , Fillon ! Mr. Sarkozy in his recent book " The People ’s Cause . " Then , Mr. Fillon trumped both Mr. him   —    humiliating him in Sunday ’s round of voting   —    and the pollsters . He came out on top in Mr. Sarkozy France ’s 101 départements Mr. Sarkozy or districts , with 44 percent of the vote , 16 Fillon of the Mr. Sarkozy Sunday , another former prime Mr. Sarkozy , Alain Juppé . Mr. Fillon won in Paris and in rural France . Fillon Juppé ’s more moderate agenda   —    fewer cuts in the Civil Service and public spending , less accommodation of Russia , friendlier to gay couples   Fillon    Sunday’s    voters , which in turn disturbed the right Fillon electorate . " It bothered me that France many Alain Juppé the left voted for him , " Michel Carron , a rural official who attended the rally here , said of Mr. Juppé . Mr. Fillon " defends our values , " he said . " We ’re in a sort of despair , and he makes us live , " Mr. Carron said , adding that Alain Juppé knows National Mr. Carron States , the pollsters had failed to detect a hidden yearning for the restoration of a mythical older France , rural and dominated by Mr. Fillon values of a conservative Roman Catholic Church . " The media , Mr. Fillon , We are out of phase with the population , which Mr. Carron fed up with being called xenophobic and Mr. Carron , " said Ms. Despointes , after Mass outside    in Paris . Mr. Fillon is not keen on social changes like    marriage and chafes at being the " vassal " of America , as he put it in his speech here . The media, television crowd at the rally was almost all white . " He ’ll help Mr. Fillon again , " said Jacqueline Badoux , a retired teacher who attended the rally . " In the fight against Islamic State , he will have the authority , " said Ms. Badoux ’s husband , Bernard , also a Mr. Fillon teacher , who Mr. Fillon mightily of Mr. Fillon ’s performance here . The very qualities the mercurial    Mr. Fillon Sarkozy made fun of , us to Mr. Buisson   —    Mr. Fillon ’s rural origins and ponderousness the rally his legendary caution and his silences "   — Mr. Fillon earned him favor with the crowd here . Jacqueline Badoux, a retired teacher who attended the rally outside Lyon . " I will Mr. Fillon family back at the heart of all public policy . " The crowd roared . Catholics are gravitating toward him because Mr. Fillon for the essential Mr. Fillon   —    family , nation Mr. Fillon Mr. Fillon’s    Fillon incarnates them with a certain tranquillity , " said the Rev.    Grosjean , a Versailles priest who writes an influential Catholic blog . " There ’s a desire to break with the spirit of May ’68 and go back Mr. Fillon’s values of the crowd education , to a France that is not ashamed of its roots , " said Father Grosjean , referring to the crowd when thousands of demonstrators took Mr. Fillon’s the streets   protesting France ’s    order . For Catholics , " he captures this Mr. Fillon’s conviction and realism , "for the essential values  —   family, nation, identity   he said . At the rally , Mr. Fillon promised to bring back school uniforms , restore respect in schools and stand up to America . Mr. Fillon is reminiscent of    Donald J. Trump in a significant way : He is friendlier toward Russia and its leader , Vladimir V. Putin . Indeed , the French news media has detailed his numerous ties to Mr. Putin   —    he has stayed at Mr. Putin France residence at Sochi , according to the newspaper Father Grosjean Monde , and played billiards with him . He Father Grosjean received a bottle of wine from Father Grosjean leader on the death of his mother , according to the newsmagazine L’Express , which described Mr. Fillon Father Grosjean French politician who " appreciates " Mr. Putin the most . Such concerns Father Grosjean it appears , did little Mr. Putin’s in the United States . Similarly , they may Father Grosjean just as easy to overlook for supporters of Mr. Putin’s Ms. Despointes . " He ’s a Mr. Fillon conviction , " she said outside Mr. Fillon . " For people who have moral values . "
