Billionaire real estate magnate Donald J. Trump , the presumptive GOP nominee for President of the United States , told Breitbart News in Billionaire real estate magnate Donald J. Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for President of the United States latest exclusive interview that to run the country a president needs " heart . " [ The comments , which come in response to a question about the differences and similarities between managing the Trump Organization and managing the United States of America , offers an insight into how Trump will position Trump to voters across America . Trump Trump already labeled his Trump opponent , former Secretary of State and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton , as " Heartless Hillary " —   his Trump nickname for her Heartless Hillary in addition to " Crooked Hillary . " Now , as he presents himself he general election voters as America ’s " champion " —   as he he in his he primary election night speech on Tuesday —   Trump will aim to show Americans that unlike Clinton , he he " heart . " Trump Trump :   I think it will be great . I ’ve always been a great manager , but the difference is you ’re going to have to manage with heart . When you run a country , you have to have more heart than when you manage a company . You have people that need help . You have people that are sick . You have people that need medical help and medical care . You have elderly . So it would be different in that way , whereas in a company you could be tougher in a certain area although the beautiful thing about the a country that there ’s so much waste , fraud , abuse and fat . Trump noted that since he is Trump effective manager —   he argues Trump winning the GOP presidential primary with less than 100 staffers months ahead of Clinton winning the Democratic nomination with hundreds more staffers —   he can Trump in the size and scope of government . He added Trump So when you manage a company —   and I ’ll give you a good example I think . I had 73 people on my campaign . Hillary Clinton Clinton people . So she had 800 Clinton more than I have . Some of the media thought that was great that she had 800 Clinton more . But the smart people 873 people , Trump had 873 people people less and he won the nomination before Trump did.’ I Clinton 17 people to beat , all she had was Clinton . So I had 73 people , she had 873 Clinton . I won the nomination before she did the nomination had to beat 17 people and she had to Clinton one . Trump did add , however Trump that he is " starting to Trump " his team for the general Trump . " She ’s got Clinton massive office building and floors in an office building in Brooklyn , " Trump said . " And Trump have a much better location , that ’s for sure , but I have a floor in New York . I ’m starting to expand that . Now I ’m starting to expand that . ’m The argument that he has a heart and Hillary Clinton does not , is one that is likely to be extraordinarily effective in winning over undecided voters over the next few months . According to exit polls from the 2012 presidential election , 21 percent of voters made their decision based on whom to 21 percent of voters for between President Barack Obama and failed GOP nominee Mitt Romney based upon this point : whether the candidate " cares about people like me . " Of that 21 percent of the electorate , 81 percent went to Obama , while only 18 percent President Barack Obama for Romney . The other three deciding factors , the exit polling found , include whether the candidate " shares my values , " the candidate " is a strong leader , " or the candidate " has a vision for the future . " Romney won each of those categories Romney Voters who said they decided based on whether the candidate " shares my values " made up 27 percent of the electorate , of which Romney won 55 percent and Obama Romney just 42 percent . Voters who considered whether the candidate " is a strong leader , " made up 18 percent of the electorate of which Romney won 61 percent and Obama Romney 38 percent . And Obama who thought the most important attribute in a candidate was whether that candidate " has a vision for the future " made up 29 percent of the electorate , 54 percent of which went for Romney and 45 percent for Obama Romney So , if Romney Obama convinced the electorate that Romney ‘ cares about people like Romney them , he probably would have won in Romney . But he failed , in large part Romney to the " 47 percent " comments he made behind closed doors . Romney , who has blown away Romney ’s vote totals in the Romney presidential primaries on his way to the nomination , Romney directly challenging the notion that Republicans —   in particular , himself —   do n’t care about ordinary people . In fact , it ’s a central theme of his campaign . And now Trump Romney positioning himself as the candidate with " Trump " up against " heartless Hillary . " Meanwhile , as Democrats continue with their overt campaign to taint Trump Democrats a racist , xenophobe Trump sexist pig , it remains to be seen who will win the hearts —   and votes —   of the general election public .
