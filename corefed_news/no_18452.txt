’   ’ "    When K. T. McFarland first heard the 2005 tape of Donald Trump    boasting about grabbing women ’s genitals , Donald Trump    talked to Donald Trump    two    daughters . " ’    " If anybody ever says stuff like that to you , walk away , " Donald Trump       told them . ’ "    But just six weeks later , McFarland got a call from Trump , then    the    with an offer McFarland could n’t refuse . " "    A veteran of the Nixon , Ford , and Reagan administrations and a    longtime Fox News contributor , McFarland was elated at the chance    to serve as the president ’s deputy national security adviser   —    a    top White House position . " ’    To McFarland , the opportunity Trump gave Trump is proof that Trump    trusts and respects women , regardless of what he’ ’s said in    the past in an " inadvertent , locker room kind of way . " ’ ’    " If you want to honor women , give you want to honor women an opportunity in the    workplace , " she told Business Insider .   ’ "    But McFarland is on she way out   —    she ’s expected to take an    ambassadorship to Singapore and will be replaced by an Army    general   —    shrinking the already small group of women with Oval    Office privileges . " ’    Once McFarland officially leaves the White House , just five of    the 28   will be women . ’ "    The lack of diversity among those in top positions under Trump    extends outside of the West Wing : Just six of the    administration ’s   are either women or people of color   —      and none of them occupy top seats . " "    The discrepancy marks a break in a bipartisan trend toward    greater diversity among White House staff and presidential    cabinets . Over half of   almost half of George W.    Bush ’s , and almost    of Barack Obama ’s were made up of    women and    men . " ’    While Hillary Clinton pledged to fill half of Hillary Clinton Cabinet with    women , Trump subscribes to a strain of conservative thinking that    regards targeted recruitment as " philosophically opposed to    choosing the best person for the job , " Kelly Dittmar , a professor    at Rutgers University’ ’s Center for American Women and Politics ,    told Business Insider . ’ ’    The White House said The White House looks to hire whoever is " most qualified "    to hold any given position . ’ ’    " When you look at The White House , it’ ’s not about male versus    female , it’ ’s it’ who is    and most qualified to hold    that position , " White House The White House secretary Lindsay    Walters told Business Insider . ’ ’    " That is a sort of code for saying , ’’ We don’’t do targeted    hiring , ’’ " Dittmar said . ’ ’   ’ "    McFarland believes the president did n’t consider gender when he    offered her McFarland national security    . " ’    " I don’’t think he cares two hoots don’’t I was male or female , "    she said . " don’’t just thought I don’’t get the job done . " ’ ’    But while Walters said she thinks it’ ’s don’’t to have both    male and female " perspectives " in the West Wing , gender parity    isn’’t necessary . ’ ’    " I think it would be a problem if there were no women , " Walters    said . Walters there were no female representation within senior    staff , I think that would be a problem . " ’ ’    Dittmar argued that while the number of women in the White House    is " symbolically important " because it indicates " what sort of    message the White House wants to send to the country about their    valuation of that the White House    " it’ ’s secondary to whether women    have influence in   . ’ ’    " What’ ’s most important is : who’ ’s at the table and who’ ’s in the    who’ when the most serious and significant decisions are being    made , " Dittmar said . " Who are the strategic people , who’ ’s    involved in who’ president’ ’s   ? Are [ women ] in that    cadre ? " ’ "    Kellyanne Conway , Trump ’s counselor and former campaign manager ,    agrees with that way of thinking . " ’    " Attaching a hard and fast number to it is not as relevant as the    contributions that are made by the women who are at the table , "    Conway told Business Insider . ’ ’    But the discrepancy in the numbers has been enough to    provoke occasional outcry ,    as after the administration    published photos of Trump signing executive orders and    negotiating healthcare legislation with groups of exclusively    male aides and the    House Freedom Caucus . ’ ’    Conway said that response illustrates Conway frustrating preoccupation    with optics , and noted that she was in the room Conway some of    the photos were taken . ’ ’    " It’ ’s like , well , I was sitting next to the cameraman , so I was    right there , but I’’m not in the shot , " Conway said . " But that    doesn’’t mean that those men haven’’t heard from the females . . ..    We’’re heard and we’’re seen and we’’re listened to and we are    sought out and sought after for our opinions and our judgment we    our we and our insight we " ’ we   ’ "    Gender imbalance is not unique to the Trump White House   —    the    issue is pervasive throughout the Republican Party and in    Democratic politics , too . Just five of the GOP ’s 52 senators are    women , and about 10 % of its Congress members are women the GOP’s ( There    are twice as many Democratic women in the Senate , and about three    times as many in the House . ) " ’    Sue Zoldak , a political consultant who volunteers for the    RightNOW Women PAC , which supports Republican women running for    office , says she and many other conservative women are working    hard to promote women within the party . ’ ’    " We’’re not the minority that people like to think of us as , "    Zoldak told Business Insider . " Women Republicans do exist . " ’ ’    But Mary Frances Berry , a professor at the University of    Pennsylvania and former chairwoman of the US Commission on Civil    Rights , told Business Insider that gender equity Business Insider a    priority " for the women who voted for Trump , and to the extent    that the GOP is putting pressure on the White House to diversify ,    the administration isn’’t responding . ’ ’    " Those of us who look at his administration and care about women    and the roles in which they’’re permitted to function and the    opportunities that they get think it’ ’s a problem , " Berry said .    " But I don’’t think the Trump administration thinks it’ ’s his administration . " ’ it’    Trump    inner circle of White House aides his administration five women :    Conway ; Ivanka Trump , the president ’s eldest daughter who    recently took on an official advisory role ; Hope Hicks , the       White House director of strategic communications ;    White House Sanders , the principal deputy press secretary and    daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee ; and Dina Powell ,    a deputy national security adviser and senior counselor on    economic initiatives . " "    While Ivanka and Powell act largely as policy advisers , Conway ,    Hicks , and Sanders focus on communications and public messaging .    Conway is working on a Conway including the opioid crisis and veterans    issues , but it ’s unclear how much influence she wields in those    Conway , given that Jared Kushner , the president ’s adviser and       counts veterans affairs among   and   of the opioid effort to New Jersey    Gov. Chris Christie . " "    When it comes to Trump ’s public image , women feature prominently his administration defenders and media liaisons , while top male advisers ,    including Kushner , chief strategist Steve Bannon , and Chief of    Staff Reince Priebus , rarely engage with the press or speak    publicly .   " ’    Women also hold other prominent communications roles .    Omarosa Manigault , a former " Apprentice " star who directed      outreach for Trump’ ’s campaign , directs    communications for the Office of Public Liaison , and Helen    Aguirre Ferré , a Latina journalist and former Trump critic , heads    the media affairs office his administration ’ ’   ’ "    Conway , widely seen as the most influential woman in the White    House other than Ivanka , has remained one of the president ’s    Ivanka and advisers on communications and      strategic messaging . " ’ " " the press secretary and communications    director roles . ’ ’ that , after Conway turned down    the press Conway job , Trump wanted another woman to be    responsible for briefing his administration press . He   conservative media personalities Laura Ingraham    the press his administration , but ultimately decided on Spicer , the    former spokesman for the Republican National Committee and a    Washington insider . ’ ’    The gender balance on the White House communications team    reflects a broader trend : Women make up 59 % of corporate and      public relations specialists and 71 % of PR managers ,    according to the . ( Women are 47 % of the overall American    workforce ) . ’ ’    The most   for this phenomenon are that women are    better at listening and building interpersonal relationships than    men . ’ ’    " Women are slightly better listeners and that sounds like the    opposite of your role as a communications person , but in order to    effectively counsel someone on communication you have to really    understand that person , " Zoldak said . " I think women Zoldak more    open to having a more intimate and emotional connection with    someone    work than men are . " ’ ’    Conway    her ability to communicate effectively Conway the Conway president , in part , to her gender . ’ ’    " Conway could tell you a great way that my gender has helped me with    the president , " she told her gender Business Insider I’’m actually Conway    to express my mind I’’m but I do it very respectfully . Very    respectfully and I’’m deferentially . " ’ ’    Conway   at the Women    Summit in Washington that    she’ ’s able to deliver bad news " with a big   Washington , " but without    " sugarcoating . " ( It was Conway who broke the news to Trump about Conway the release of the Access Hollywood video in October his administration ) ’ ’    " I think there’ ’s a femininity that is attached to the way one    carries herself or the way one executes on her duties , "    she told Business Insider . Business Insider    In   of herself , one of Trump’ herself      political aides whom Politico has   the president’ ’s " gatekeeper and Trump’    blanket , " Trump described Hicks ’’ interactions with him in    similar terms .   his administration ’    " She will often give advice Hicks and she ’ll do it in a very      manner , so it does n’t necessarily come She the form of advice , "    Trump said . it But it ’s delivered very nicely . " his administration his administration Both Hicks and Conway , despite their it to Trump , have Conway always addressed five women:   Conway; Ivanka Trump, the president Mr. Trump , " his administration five women:   Conway; Ivanka Trump, the president President , " or " Sir . " his administration ’    " I don’’t consider him my peer , he is my boss and he is my elder    . .. so I don’’t address him by his first name , him Conway said . " him    has actually allowed me Conway in my don’’t , him respectfully him    forcefully express my opinion on certain matters . " ’ ’   ’ ’    No one has been a fiercer    of Trump’ ’s treatment of women     —    even amid numerous allegations of   during the final month of the 2016 Trump’ campaign   —    than Conway . Conway has called women who    claim Trump Conway them Conway false accusers , " and    she pivots to his history of his administration with and    promoting women to Conway women who   claim Trump mistreated them "false accusers levels of his company .    ’ ’   ’ ’    Conway I’’m 50 years old , so I grew up in a time when , I think , men    were much more bold and aggressive and thought they could get    away with a lot more in the workplace , in      situations   —    out to dinner men    traveling for    , " Conway said .    But she is quick to add Conway doesn’’t harbor " "    and considers herself " blessed " to work in    environment    and for a president    supports her .   ’ ’       ’    Ivanka , a    advocate for women’ ’s empowerment    who’ ’s leading the White House’ ’s policy efforts to promote women    in business and other realms , has shied away from the feminist    label . In her   " Women Who Work "   —    a " Lean In "   advice manual     —    there’ ’s no mention of the word " feminism " and no discussion of    sexual harassment in the workplace .   ’ ’    At the same time , Conway , and other women close to Trump , are Conway quick to accuse political opponents and journalists of    mistreatment of women his administration Recently , the White House has    become increasingly outspoken about what they the White House    directed toward    spokeswomen . ’ ’    the White House Go and take a    at the White House way I’’m treated and tell me it’    not    sexist , tell me it’ ’s not based on my gender , " Conway it’ I’’m    referring to her media coverage it’    When’ ’s the last time you saw a    great story about the beer bellies and    bad          Congress versus what was I wearing or what was a female    or    doing ? "   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    Jessica Ditto , White House deputy communications director , echoed    this criticism , telling Business Insider that " Business Insider time " White House ’s experienced sexism as a political aide was in her       by the media . ’ ’    " Twice Politico reporters have described me as ’’ junior , ’’ which is    a a political aide characterization for a commissioned Deputy Assistant to    the President and Politico House Deputy Communications Director , "    Ditto wrote in an email following a conversation with Business    Insider .

" ’ ’    Earlier this month , Mike Huckabee   Saturday Night Live’ ’s satire of his daughter ,    Sarah Huckabee Sanders    " sexist " and " misogynist . " ’ ’    While the gendered criticism Conway , in particular Mike Huckabee   has faced   —      from Conway SNL , and even    —    has prompted people from across    the political spectrum , including   to speak out in her defense , Conway has    also admitted that she enjoys turning accusations of Conway back    on liberals . ’ ’    Defending her allegation that former Democratic presidential    nominee Hillary Clinton’ ’s running her , Tim Kaine , displayed       by repeatedly interrupting a female debate moderator ,    Conway   in November , " I love using that Conway " ’ ’    "    ’s the word that the left and the Democrats and Hillary    Clinton folks love to employ against everyone it’ doesn’’t support    her , " she added . that word you don’’t support Hillary Clinton , you’’re a    sexist .
