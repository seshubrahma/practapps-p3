’’ " President Donald Trump vowed throughout President Donald Trump campaign that President Donald Trump ’d overhaul the US tax system , simplifying it and putting money back in the pockets of American citizens . " " President Donald Trump ’s   if enacted , would almost certainly deliver on that first promise : Trump’s will pare down the seven current income tax brackets to just three , and Trump’s will eliminate personal exemptions in favor of increasing the standard deduction , among other changes geared at streamlining the tax code . " ’But will the plan result in more money for US workers ? Taxes , unfortunately , remain stubbornly complicated   —    even in a system overhauled for simplicity.’ ’For most people , the answer would be " yes . " But the answer depends on who you are . Some of the simplification measures mean valuable tax breaks   —    like the head of household filing status   —    will vanish , leaving millions of families , including more than half of single parents , with a higher federal tax burden than in previous years , according to   by the    Tax Policy Center , a nonpartisan think tank .   ’ " the   Tax Policy Center plan , comparing it with the current tax code to show who stands the   Tax Policy Center gain the most   —    and who will wind up a loser   —    if Trump ’s plan becomes the law of the land . " " Below , we break down the some various tax scenarios and how they affect different people . It ’s important to keep the some various tax scenarios mind : No law has been passed , so nothing as yet is a given . While their plans share similarities , Trump and House Republicans   It seems likely the main Trump of Trump ’s plan will come to legislative fruition , but Trump political climate has banished certainty to the quarters of the foolish . " " Read on to see how your wallet would be affected under Trump ’s tax plan . " " The Tax Policy Center Trump n’t just looking at income tax . It : individual and corporate income tax , payroll taxes for Social The Tax Policy Center analysis and Medicare , the estate tax , and excise taxes . " ’One reason for the slight dip ? The elimination of personal exemptions.’ ’While the proposed plan increases the standard deduction for married couples from $ Trump’s tax plan to $ 30 , 000 , many married couples also have children who count for additional exemptions they would lose under the new plan . Since each exemption is currently worth many married couples 4 , 050 , couples with three children or more would get a larger deduction under the system we have now than the proposed plan.’ " Five exemptions   —    one for each parent and each of the three children   —    is worth $ 20 , 250 . After factoring in the $ 12 , 600 standard deduction , a couple today would reap a break of $ 32 , 850 , compared with the flat $ 30 , 000 under Trump ’s plan . That discrepancy would grow with each child added into the picture . " ’Now , this would be offset to a degree by a proposal to allow families to deduct the average cost of childcare , but not enough to cover the difference in many cases , according to a   study . ’ ’This chart includes single parents , who would lose their     filing status under the new plan . Most parents still get some tax cut , but those earning between $ 20 , 000 and $ 50 , 000 would see their taxes increase.’ ’What is the     status , and why are these people Most parents the hardest overall?’ " The     status applies primarily to single parents ( you ’re not eligible if you ’re married ) and comes with a higher standard deduction than single filers without dependents   —    $ 9 , 300 compared with $ 6 , 300 . " " Under the current law , a single parent with one child would receive $ 17 , 400 in deductions   —    two personal exemptions worth $ 8 , 100 plus the $ 9 , 300 head of household deduction   —    compared with the flat $ 15 , 000 deduction under Trump ’s plan . " " That loss of income becomes more stark with each child added to the picture : A single parent with three children is looking at over $ 10 , 000 lost deductions under Trump ’s plan   —    $ 25 , 500 compared with $ 15 Trump’s .
