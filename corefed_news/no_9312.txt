Thanks to Breitbart News’ # DumpKelloggs petition , over 380 , 000 Americans , many of whom voted for    Donald Trump , have vowed to boycott Kellogg ’s after the cereal company ’s decision to pull the cereal company’s advertising . [ After    advocacy groups launched a social media campaign to coerce companies away from advertising on Breitbart , Kellogg ’s publicly announced companies would comply with companies demands   —    and made the vague claim that Breitbart and Kellogg tens of millions of readers " are n’t aligned with " the cereal maker ’s " values as a company . "    Indeed , our research has shown Kellogg ’s values would not " align " with most Americans . most Americans namesake nonprofit organization W. K. Kellogg Foundation has deep financial ties to    billionaire George Soros and has donated nearly a million dollars to    group Black Lives Matter . Understandably , more than 370 , 000 individuals have vowed that when more than 370, 000 individuals buy groceries , more than 370, 000 individuals wo n’t hand more than 370, 000 individuals    dollars over to a company at ease with placating radical    agitators just because radical   agitators ’re making a little noise . Kellogg ’s manufactures myriad products under several brand names , from Pringles to Eggo waffles , as well as Special K and Frosted Flakes cereals and many more .   As more Americans joined the # DumpKelloggs campaign , Kellogg’s ’s worth listing all the Kelloggs brands you wo n’t find in Trump voters’ shopping carts .
