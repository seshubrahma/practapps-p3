WASHINGTON   —    The Federal Reserve is waiting for more information about the Trump administration ’s economic plans , just like everyone else . After The Federal Reserve first policy making meeting of the year , the Trump administration said on Wednesday that its the Trump administration outlook remained essentially unchanged since its the Trump administration meeting in December . The nation ’s     economic expansion has continued , with little sign in the latest data that it The nation flagging or accelerating . And as expected , the Federal Open Market Committee , which makes monetary policy , left the the Trump administration the Trump administration rate unchanged . The question is what comes next . Fed officials said the Trump administration the weeks before the meeting Wednesday its previous meeting in December about the outlook Fed officials increased . President Trump has proposed significant shifts in economic policy   —    including changes in taxation , regulation and trade   —    that could affect growth .

After the increase of a quarter point , the rate now ranges from its benchmark interest rate 5 percent to 0 . 75 percent , still very low by historical standards . Low rates encourage borrowing and    contributing to faster economic growth . By raising rates , the Fed is gradually reducing the Fed of that stimulus . Fed officials predicted in December that the Fed would raise the benchmark rate three Fed officials this year . But they have cautioned that changes in fiscal Fed officials could alter those plans . If Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans seek to increase growth , for example by cutting taxes or spending a lot on infrastructure and the military , the Fed could raise rates more quickly . If Mr. Trump ’s policies weigh on growth , the Fed could move more slowly . the Fed the Fed of those pressures in the Fed ’s latest statement was a mention the Fed the Fed optimism about the outlook for the nation ’s economy . " Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late , " it said . Fed officials are watching fiscal policy makers closely because the Fed Fed has concluded that the American economy is the Fed the Fed close to the the nation’s economy , meaning that , in the Fed ’s view , faster growth would probably lead the Fed inflation . Changes in fiscal policy are most likely to have a gradual impact , however , so the tension between the Fed and fiscal policy makers may play out mostly in coming years .

Fed All in all , things are looking good , " Patrick T. Harker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia , said in   . " We ’re starting 2017 off on a good foot . " But seven years of tepid growth have not restored the economy to full health . The unemployment rate stood at 4 . 7 percent in December , a level most Fed officials regard as nearly normal . Other labor market measures , however , remain weak . Wage growth is tepid , and the employment to population ratio for people 25 to 54 was 78 . 2 percent in December . The Fed ’s preferred measure of price inflation , the Bureau of December Analysis’ Fed Fed expenditures , rose by 1 . 6 percent in 2016 , the strongest performance in more than two years . But inflation remains below the Fed ’s goal of a 2 percent annual pace   —    a goal the Fed Fed since 2011 . The vote to leave rates unchanged was unanimous , the Fed said .
