I have worked with Stephen K. Bannon ,    Donald Trump ’s new chief strategist and senior counselor , for nearly six years at Breitbart News . I can say , without hesitation , that Steve is a friend of the Jewish people and a defender of Israel , as well as being a passionate American patriot and a great leader . [ A word or two about my credentials : I am an Orthodox Jew , and I hold a Master of Arts degree in Jewish Studies . My thesis at the Isaac and Jesse Kaplan Centre at the University of Cape Town dealt with the troubled status of Jews in an increasingly    and antisemitic ,    South Africa . I believe My thesis at the Isaac and Jesse Kaplan Centre at the University of Cape Town to be a qualified judge of what is , and is not , antisemitic .   It defies logic that a man who was a close friend , confidant , and adviser to the late Andrew Breitbart   —    a proud Jew   —    could have any negative feelings towards Jews . As I can testify from years of work together with Steve in close quarters , the opposite is the case : Steve is outraged by antisemitism . If anything , Steve is overly sensitive about it , and often takes offense on Jews’ behalf . Steve cares deeply about the fate of Jewish communities in America and throughout the world , a fact that is reflected in Breitbart News’ daily coverage . It was in that spirit that Steve joined Breitbart News CEO Larry Solov ( also Jewish ) in launching Breitbart Jerusalem last year , fulfilling Andrew ’s dream of opening a bureau in Israel specifically to cover the region from an unabashedly Zionist perspective . I ’ve worked closely    Steve Bannon at Breitbart . Breitbart ’s an American patriot who also defends Israel has deep empathy for the Jewish people .   —    Joel B.

Americans should see Steve ’s appointment to a key White House role as a positive sign that    Donald Trump intends to fulfill his   Donald Trump . Andrew Breitbart anticipated the kind of attacks that Steve Steve and anyone else who is effective at opposing the left , would face . In his Andrew Breitbart Righteous Indignation : Excuse Me While I Save the World , Andrew noted that the "   complex " would tarnish any conservative with "   closet KKK status .
