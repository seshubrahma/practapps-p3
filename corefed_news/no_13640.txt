Last week , we brought you the story of how Colin Kaepernick declined to vote in this year ’s presidential election . Well , it turns out Colin Kaepernick has never even registered to vote , anywhere . [ According to the Sacramento Bee , " Kaepernick , who was raised in Turlock , ( California ) turned 18 in 2005 , but Colin Kaepernick has not registered to vote in California at any point in the last decade , according to records maintained by the California Secretary of State . Colin Kaepernick also did not register in Nevada while Colin Kaepernick attended the University of Nevada , Reno , from 2006 to 2010 , according to the Washoe County Registrar of Voters . That means Colin Kaepernick missed presidential elections in 2008 and 2012   —    when Democrat Barack Obama was elected president   —    in addition to a variety of state and local elections in other years . "   The ballot in California this year alone was four pages long . To put this in perspective , if you mark 2006 for the start of Colin Kaepernick ’s legal voting lifetime and factor in an average of three pages of ballots a year , Colin Kaepernick missed at least five elections and at least 15 pages worth of referendums , propositions , and ballot initiatives that could have effected issues Colin Kaepernick claims to care about . For anyone who views those pesky California ballots , referendums , and initiatives as inconsequential , remember that California voters once removed a sitting governor at the ballot box . The Gray Davis recall occurred before Kaepernick reached voting age , but based on Colin Kaepernick track record Colin Kaepernick probably would n’t have shown up for that , either . Kaepernick not voting in any of the Obama elections stands out as the real offense here . Colin Kaepernick claimed this election as nothing more than a contest to see " who ’s less racist , " calling both Trump and Clinton racist . Given that , would n’t this election have made a lot of sense to vote for the first black president in history , the one man Kapernick believes is not a racist ? this election would have made a lot of sense , but as we ’ve come to understand about Colin Kaepernick , when something makes a lot of sense the one man Kapernick does the other thing .
