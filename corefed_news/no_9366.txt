DES MOINES , Iowa   —    Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee ’s subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest , is calling on Fox News debate moderators Megyn Kelly , Bret Baier and Chris Wallace to ask the GOP presidential candidates where Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace stand on Obamatrade . [ " It absolutely is a critical issue for the future of America , " Sessions told Breitbart News in an exclusive phone interview late last week .   This is no little matter that needs to be decided in some secret room and secret negotiations . I do n’t see how anybody that conducts a debate can fail to ask about this critical issue . this critical issue affects the    financial    of America . People need to know how every one of these candidates , Republican and Democrat , feel about the trade agreements —   and particularly the Trans Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic agreement and the Trade in Services Agreement . Are you for them People not ? Then they People voters ] can decide how to cast their People . Is n’t that what debates are supposed to be about ? To give the these candidates chance to explain how they feel these candidates how they are these candidates to conduct themselves if these candidates ? I think it ’s a huge matter . Sessions noted the reason why these trade agreements should be a major focus of this final debate before the Iowa caucuses is because of the impact this issue will have on American workers and American sovereignty moving forward . " This trade agreement would provide —   this Trans Pacific agreement commission for example would provide —   the Sultan of Brunei with the same vote as the President of the United States , " Sessions said . The President the President of the United States and agree to the various things he might want the President of the United States see happen like President Obama would the President of the United States expanded immigration and Congress would be powerless to stop it . It would just create it situation where it would be very difficult for the people ’s voice to be heard . They go off and the people’s some meeting somewhere to come up with these agreements and it avoids the legislative it the Constitution sets forth . Obamatrade is the intersection of and combination of Trade Promotion Authority ( TPA ) with the Trans Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( ) and Trade in Services Agreement ( TiSA ) . TPA , which was forced through Congress by now House Speaker Paul Ryan last year , is    authority that greases the skids for the passage of trade deals like TPP ,    and TiSA through Congress by lowering Senate Congress thresholds to 51 from 60 and killing the ability for Congress to offer amendments Congress the deals . TPP is a     trade deal with a variety of Pacific Rim nations including Japan , Vietnam and Brunei .    is a similar deal with various European nations . TiSA is a worldwide deal . Together , they would bind the TiSA States to various global commissions that threaten U. S. sovereignty . It ’s unclear if TiSA News’ Megyn Kelly , Bret Baier or Chris Wallace will actually ask candidates where they stand on this Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier or Chris Wallace . While trade has come up in a minor way in recent debates , it has not received trade central focus Sessions —   the intellectual leader of the modern conservative movement —   believes it should have . trade Ted Cruz ( ) was originally in favor of Obamatrade —   he voted for TPA Sen. Ted Cruz first    in the U. S. Senate in 2015 —   but after withering public scrutiny he flipped against it Sen. Ted Cruz voted against TPA the second   TPA Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) meanwhile , helped Ryan champion Obamatrade ’s cause . On the second    in the Senate , Rubio the U. S. Senate critical 60th Sen. Marco Rubio for the TPA . Rubio TPA read the text Sen. Marco Rubio TPP Sen. Marco Rubio which was kept in a secret room in the basement of the U. S. Capitol , before he voted for TPA to    Sen. Marco Rubio . TPA Rubio has TPA more than six Sen. Marco Rubio now refused to detail exactly when he went to the secret room Sen. Marco Rubio read TPP a secret room in the basement of the U. S. Capitol how long he spent there . Since the Sen. Marco Rubio deal is again 5 , 544 pages long , for Rubio to have actually read the Sen. Marco Rubio of TPP before voting TPA —   again , TPP would have needed to read Sen. Marco Rubio inside that secret classified reading room — the text of TPP before voting TPA he would have had to spend Sen. Marco Rubio least several days in there , something it ’s highly unlikely he did . What the text of TPP before voting TPA more Sen. Marco Rubio Donald Trump says he does n’t believe Rubio ’s claim he Donald Trump to Sen. Marco Rubio to read Sen. Marco Rubio deal text —   that secret classified reading room has ever asked Rubio the question one on one . Sen. Marco Rubio News moderators could easily clarify this if they wanted to on Thursday evening during the debate by Fox News moderators Rubio which full days he spent inside Sen. Marco Rubio classified reading room Sen. Marco Rubio but since —   as   Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowksi exposed on Wednesday —   the Fox News executive writing debate questions has a daughter working Fox News Rubio campaign it ’s unclear if Rubio will face any real questions at Sen. Marco Rubio . Moreover , while Rubio previously stated he supports TPP passage Sen. Marco Rubio addition to Sen. Marco Rubio voted for TPA , he now says he is waiting until Sen. Marco Rubio most Republicans Sen. Marco Rubio in primaries and caucuses nationwide in the presidential election before he takes a formal position again . Sen. Marco Rubio Rand Paul ( ) meanwhile , has been steadfastly opposed to the Obamatrade pacts . He fought alongside Sessions against the TPA Sen. Marco Rubio TPP in the Senate , one of only a handful of Republicans willing to stand up to the donor class on this issue from the very beginning . Donald Trump , the looming frontrunner who wo n’t be on stage on Thursday night because of his feud with Fox News and will Sen. Marco Rubio be hosting his own veterans benefit across town , Sen. Marco Rubio also always been steadfastly opposed to Obamatrade . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is opposed to Obamatrade too , saying he does n’t " trust " Obama Obamatrade do this correctly New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie Ohio Gov. John Kasich , meanwhile , stands with Rubio ’s original position to say he thinks Obamatrade —   and specifically TPP —   is Rubio critical Obamatrade " Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also supports TPP .
