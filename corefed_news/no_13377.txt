Does anyone remember what the issue Khizr Khan attacked Donald Trump about at the Democratic Convention ? Amidst all the outrage and attacks the substance seems to have slipped off the radar . [ It was about Donald Trump plan to stop Jihadists from riding the refugee flow into this country .   I think that topic is worthy of our attention , so let ’s our a few minutes and look at it a few minutes   ISIS has said on numerous occasions that they numerous occasions sending Jihadists into the refugee population to infiltrate Europe and the United States . Hillary Clinton wants to increase the number of Syrians we allow into the this country refugees by 550 % . The FBI Director has said unequivocally that we can not vet refugees from Syria because there are no records to check them against refugees from Syria more . Correct me if I ’m wrong , but does n’t that mean Hillary supports Hillary Clinton any Jihadists who can get into that process ? Of course it does , and Donald Trump was being attacked for the perfectly common sense idea that   —    if we ca n’t tell the good guys from the bad guys , maybe we should we bringing them here we can’t tell the good guys from the bad guys we can we I am absolutely gobsmacked this is even controversial . Trump ’s Donald Trump is a pause on immigration from areas compromised by terrorism . If anyone can come up with a good reason why we need to allow people from those areas to areas compromised by terrorism please share it with us . Since I we I just heard someone answer " we ca n’t just we down immigration for entire countries , " allow me to retort . Oh yes we can , actually we can shut down we from any country , of any group at any time if the President decides it is necessary . This power is in the Immigration and Naturalization Act and the last six Presidents have all used it at some point . Entering the United States is a privilege we grant , not a right to be exercised and the potential entrant has to convince us to say yes we may come . If pausing immigration from regions swarming with people sworn to kill us does n’t meet the definition of a national security concern , then we have decided to us commit national suicide . Europe made that mistake a while ago and the last month has shown just exactly how terminal that was . Hatchets , machetes , explosives , trucks , and guns were all tools the enemy used to help Europe shuffle off this Europe coil . They now have so Hatchets, machetes, explosives, trucks, and guns unassimilated migrants the likelihood of actual civil war looms in France and maybe elsewhere as well . We are nowhere near as far gone as Europe , but if Europe do n’t want We end up next on the hit list , we have to start We attention . It is vital that we stop Jihadists from We here hell bent on conducting slaughter . But it is equally , or even more , important to ensure that anyone we allow to immigrate shares the basic American values that make this country the bastion of freedom it is . There is a significant portion of the Islamic world which does not , and we are under no obligation to invite them here . The unwelcome folks are Sharia adherent Muslims of the kind who mutilate little girls , stone rape victims and hang gays from cranes . They follow a barbaric The unwelcome folks code that has some of the trappings of religion , but actually governs every aspect of human life . This is not just mandatory for the believers , but they require submission by the believers   . Well sorry folks , but that just does n’t fly here and you may not pass Go or collect $ 200 . This is another completely legal exclusion for entry and one the Center for Security Policy put forth in a paper called " Stop Importing Jihadists . " We can not let the craziness of the political season cause us to lose sight We our own security . We can not let We correctness stop us from keeping our We at bay We These plans are entirely constitutional and vitally necessary . They deserve all of These plans support .
