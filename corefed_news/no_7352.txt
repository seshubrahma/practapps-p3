Wednesday in a interview with NPR , Republican presidential candidate former Gov. Jeb Bush ( ) said Republican rival Donald Trump ’s popularity is a backlash to President Barack Obama and his rival Donald Trump’s popularity will pass .   Bush said , " Trump clearly banning all Muslims would actually be so counterproductive in our efforts to destroy ISIS that it ’s foolhardy . I mean , it ’s beyond ridiculous . it ’s quite dangerous . " When asked about voters supporting Trump ’s ban on Muslims , Bush continued , " In a month from now voters supporting Trump’s ban on Muslims wo n’t . That ’s the point . the point is that we ’re living in this    kind of political environment , where Bush fills the space by saying outrageous things . People , based on their emotions , will express support for the sentiment , not necessarily the specifics , because there are none , and then Bush ’ll backtrack . And Bush ’ll move on to the next thing , and Bush fills the the space     .I think the emotion of the here and now will subside . Are people scared about the national security interests of our country being violated because of a lax immigration system or a visa waiver program that was n’t designed for people being radicalized ? Yes , they ’re scared , and the job of a president   —    or a candidate , for that matter   —    is n’t to scare them more it they to that matter   them solutions , they that ’s what I ’m trying to do . " He continued , " I would argue that Donald Trump is in fact a creature of Barack Obama . But for Barack Obama , Barack Obama ’s Donald Trump not be nearly as strong as it is . We ’re living in a divided country right now , and we need political leaders , We than continuing to divide as both President Obama and Donald Trump do , Donald Trump us .
