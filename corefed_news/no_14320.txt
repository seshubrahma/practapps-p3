Detroit ( CNN ) As Detroit (CNN) progressive base rages against President Donald Trump , the candidates vying to lead the Democratic Party are all abiding by a simple rule : First , do no harm .   Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison , Labor Secretary Tom Perez and South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg are leading a race for Democratic National Committee chair that often sounds like an echo chamber . The candidates’ ideas are largely    and built mostly around a desire to do everything possible to tap into the    progressive energy without risking damage to what many fear is still a new and fragile movement that could die out well before the next election . Gathered over the weekend in Detroit for their third of four " future forums " before the party selects a new chair , it was increasingly clear that even those seeking to lead the party are still trying to figure out how to harness a movement that has gained voice and energy during Trump ’s first couple of weeks in office . " A lot of what we ’re wrestling with in terms of a movement the likes of which we have n’t seen since the ’60s , and where the the party into that , is uncharted territory , at least for our generation , " Buttigieg said in an interview .   It is , in part , because the new DNC chair wo n’t be installed until well after this first wave of    activism .   The 447 DNC voting DNC wo n’t select their new The 447 DNC voting members February in Atlanta .   At forums for DNC candidates DNC the same ideas     the importance of organizing , a    strategy , more funding for state parties , a focus on voting access and total deference to voters in primaries , to avoid the appearance of Hillary     Sanders style favoritism     are espoused by each of the candidates .   " We ignored the basics " in 2016 , Perez said on stage in Detroit . " We all like each other so much that whenever anyone has a great idea or a great phrase , it ends up getting incorporated into all of our speeches , " said Sally Boynton Brown , the Idaho Democratic Party executive director and a candidate for chair . " I think that ’s a problem for all of us . " Buttigieg argued that " people are treating things as obvious a little too soon "     pointing to the idea of a    strategy , focusing beyond the big states , which was " wildly controversial " when Howard Dean first introduced it in 2005 .   Tea party and town hall project , As Democrats decide on their new leader , Tea party and town hall series of ad hoc groups have already taken on the task of organizing and channeling the protests     mirroring the tea party , which grew outside the Republican Party establishment in 2009 and 2010 but was eventually embraced and fueled by the GOP .    Jimmy Dahman     who spent the 2016 presidential campaign as a field organizer for Hillary Clinton in Iowa and Ohio     recently tapped into his network of Democratic Jimmy Dahman    who spent the 2016 presidential campaign as a field organizer for Hillary Clinton in Iowa and Ohio     to recruit an army of 100 volunteers to launch the " Town Hall Project . "   It was a simple idea : Dahman , his volunteers and other Jimmy Dahman    who spent the 2016 presidential campaign as a field organizer for Hillary Clinton in Iowa and Ohio     on social media would compile every Republican town hall meeting or event into one giant spreadsheet and post it online .   one giant spreadsheet by the massive turnout of    activists at a town hall hosted by Rep. Mike Coffman ,    Dahman said he believed people craved   Dahman to tell their representatives        much people tea partiers did in 2009     and he wanted a way   Dahman empower them .   " their representatives        thought , ’I wonder how many people feel the same way but did n’t know the event exists,’ " Dahman said . "   Dahman ’s an energy there . We just want to give people something to do with it . "   He said he ’s   Dahman reports   Dahman lawmakers moving their    events to lawmakers venues .   " It ’s not just in these big cities or where you ’d expect     it ’s in swing It . It ’s in safe It , " he said . "   Dahman ’s encouraging to me is that there   Dahman so many people interested and there are groups like this popping up with regularity . "   Surprised by base ’s energy , In Detroit , Democrats described being astonished by the base ’s energy . They said they ’d Democrats    Democrats posted on Facebook by people who were not already deeply connected to the party draw hundreds of attendees .   Additional new groups are taking on tasks such as training potential candidates for office . Two veteran Democratic operatives launched " Run for Something "     with about 200 party professionals volunteering to help    activists who want to get involved on the local or state level but do n’t know where to start .   As of Friday , the group said , Two veteran Democratic operatives 300 people had already signed up to run for some office .

Another 500 were on a waiting list , and the group is working to Two veteran Democratic operatives in    sessions , too 500 women   Outside Washington , Democratic state attorneys general Washington increasingly coordinating their legal battles against the Trump Democratic state attorneys general     with figures like California Attorney General Xavier Beccera and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman expected to play increasingly prominent roles . The super PAC Priorities USA has brought Democratic superlawyer Marc Elias onto its board and plans to focus The super PAC Priorities USA fighting    GOP efforts to restrict voting access in courts and legislatures .   Meanwhile , former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading the new National Democratic Redistricting Committee , which will similarly combat the    efforts that have helped the GOP secure its House majority   GOP What many   GOP hope the national party will become is something   GOP Republican National Committee under former chairman Reince Priebus     a Wisconsin operative whose focus on the nuts and bolts of collecting voter data , building party operations in each state and fundraising allowed the party to turn over the keys of a   GOP to Trump once he was the nominee , rather than building that campaign from scratch , as Hillary Clinton largely did .   The DNC chair candidates argued the base ’s enthusiasm is only helping Democrats , even in red states , where 10 Democratic senators are up for    in 2018 in states Trump won . Perez said the party is still confronting " existential threats , " the base loss of white voters in rural and exurban Rust Belt the base . " That ’s why I ’m going out to rural America next week     to Wisconsin and Kansas     to talk to them about , what was it about our message that did the base resonate with you ? " he the base . " We have to make the base calls in this job . " the base Ellison said it ’s urgent for the party to do all it can this job encourage and channel the    protests . " the party have to understand one simple idea , and that is if you want a friend , you have to be one , " he said .   Still , Ellison acknowledged that organizing and Ellison are n’t enough     the Ellison needs money , and needs to spend it on the party . " You ’ve got to train , the party and get some of these young people to run for office . "
