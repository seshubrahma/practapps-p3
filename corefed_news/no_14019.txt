  ( CNN ) Donald Trump ’s inauguration will feature readings , musical performances and prayers , but like Donald Trump Republican predecessors , no poets , according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies . This prompts the question :   What impact does poetry   —    or its absence   —    have at moments of national significance ?   Former Poet Laureate of the United States Rita Dove thinks not having poet is a meaningful moment missed .   To Former Poet Laureate of the United States Rita Dove , poems are unique because we connect with poems on an individual and a collective level . Former Poet Laureate of the United States Rita Dove says , " When you hear a poem , you both feel a poem enter you , but you also have to rise to meet a poem . That pulls the citizen in you out , into the air . That ’s why I think a poem ’s important and meaningful to have a poem read at a    of a president . " Dove read Former Poet Laureate of the United States Rita Dove poem , " Lady Freedom Among Us , " at the bicentennial of the laying of the cornerstone of the Capitol in 1993 . Poets have been , for some inauguration watchers , a part of the spectacle of the occasion since Robert Frost , the first poet to appear at the ceremony , read for John F. Kennedy ’s    in 1961 . And yet , according to inaugural historian Jim Bendat , it has n’t been a consistent feature of the day . Only Democrats     Kennedy , Bill Clinton , and Barack Obama     have had a poet read from the steps of the Capitol . The air was bitterly cold in January 2009 when poet Elizabeth Alexander read " Praise Song for the Morning , " composed for the occasion of Barack Obama ’s first inauguration . She Barack Obama the perhaps unenviable task of following the President as a speaker , but her Barack Obama on the program     between Obama Barack Obama inaugural address and the final benediction from the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery     offers some insight into what role poems have historically played in the    of presidents . Between the new leader ’s vision for our nation and a prayer to keep it safe and free , there was poetry . As Jim Bendat points out , to be an inaugural poet is to join an intimate group of only five , with only two     Alexander , and Richard Blanco , who read " One Today " when Barack Obama was inaugurated for his Barack Obama term     still living . Bendat Jim Bendat that only Democratic presidents     JFK , Clinton , and Obama     have had a poet at their only Democratic presidents    JFK, Clinton, and Obama     .   Robert Frost actually prepared a poem ( " Dedication , " later retitled " For John F. Kennedy His John F. Kennedy " ) for the occasion but chose in the moment ( because , he John F. Kennedy His Inauguration") said and as Bendat outlines in his John F. Kennedy His Inauguration") , he John F. Kennedy His Inauguration") n’t see to read the words he John F. Kennedy His Inauguration") typed out on the page because of the bright sunlight ) to recite from memory a shorter poem , " The Gift Outright . "   Frost ’s improvisation aside , inaugural poets have delivered a work written for the occasion : Maya Angelou ’s " On the Pulse of Morning , " Miller Williams’ " Of Hope and History " for Clinton     and Alexander and Blanco for Obama .   Dove , whose most recent book is Collected Poems :    is now the Commonwealth Professor of English at the University of Virginia . She the Commonwealth Professor of English at the University of Virginia with me about the power poetry can have for everyday citizens and a commander in chief . The interview was lightly edited for clarity and length .   CNN : What stands out to you as meaningful in idea of a poem being read at the    of a president ?   Rita Dove : What is meaningful about a poem being read at any event where a nation or a community is gathered is that a poem will make us feel like we us coming together . But at the same time , you can feel an incredibly individual sense of empathy . You feel like an individual but you are also part of a community . That is both immensely comforting and challenging and exhilarating .   When you look at the word inaugural     where does this word really come from , what does it this word mean or stand for ?     you see that its this word is embedded deep in its this word ’augur’ in ancient Rome , was the word for omen , for foreboding . It turns out that an inauguration was actually a situation where you would ask for a sign from the gods that you were doing something right .   What a poem does is remind us is that we us fallible and at the same time that we us just trying to do the right thing . When you hear a poem , you both feel it a poem you , but you also have to rise to meet it a poem That pulls the citizen in you out , into the air . That ’s why I think it a poem important and meaningful to have a poem read at a    of a president . CNN : What prompted your participation in Writers Resist and why choose to read the a poem read at a   of a president Dove : For me , to participate Dove not only a call to literary arms     a way of saying that we are not going to sit back and roll over and do whatever the new government decides is best for us     but it we meant that the new government were taking a step into the political arena . That writers are not the stereotypical person writing in the attic or the ivory tower . We are of the we in the world and write the world world and therefore it the world to get out we and talk . I was so happy that there was a venue where this could be expressed , not only in New York but all over the country .   I chose ( to read ) " Lady Freedom Among Us , " which is a poem I had written back when I was poet laureate . I felt moved to write it when I was newly appointed , ( when ) I was reflecting on what a poet laureate stands for . I had gotten so many letters and responses from perfect strangers , who pretty much told me how much it meant to have someone ( like me ) who could speak for them .   ( The poem ) is about the statue on top of the Capitol Building , Lady Freedom , who was erected sometime in the nineteenth century and had been taken down for cleaning ( in 1993 ) . It prompted me to think about what Lady Freedom would see if she were standing in the street Lady Freedom . I wrote it out of my heart . It just kind of bubbled up It When I was asked to read at the laying of the cornerstone ( of the Capitol , in 1993 ) and I said I would read that poem , no one vetted the poem . They trusted me that poem was the no one era     they trusted that as poet laureate , no one would read something appropriate . And I found that so immensely hopeful . Now , we flash forward to 2017 , and I feel we ’re in a very different atmosphere we And the poem became less a poem about that poem being together and it was more a poem of warning , that poem a lament . CNN : Thinking back , do any other selected works read on the day at Writers Resist stand out in your mind ? Dove : One that sticks out : ( " Poem " by ) Muriel Rukeyser     " I lived in the first century of world wars . " It ’s an amazing poem because she wrote this poem many , many decades Muriel Rukeyser     and yet it ’s so appropriate today . She ’s It " the news would pour Muriel Rukeyser     of various devices , " and " I would call my friends on other devices " and everyone was " more or less mad . " And I just thought this is the feeling of the times now . Then it has that incredible last line : " this lived in the first century of these wars . " And you realize that she is prophesying that this will go on Muriel Rukeyser     And so that one has been haunting me .   The Langston Hughes poem , " Let America be America Again , " which I think reclaims the language that has been taken from us with " make America great again "     which is in America certain way a very negative statement . It assumes something is direly wrong with America , and what Langston Hughes’ poem is America is that America was always America , just let it America , just America yourself to all the possibilities of America . That poem has always been an America for Langston Hughes’ poem And then when Rosanne Cash recited the Leonard Cohen song ( " Democracy " ) at the end of the gathering : " Democracy is coming to the USA . " She did just a gorgeous recitation . She could have sung it , but by saying She , you realize how potent the words are it   CNN : Writers Resist was so striking because in many ways , it is participatory poetry . Is there a poem ( or a poet ’s work ) you could imagine Americans standing up where they are to read in public places on Inauguration Americans ? Dove : How powerful that would be if you could do that , in the spirit of America . We are a nation of many different kinds of people and that ’s what makes us , I believe , great and strong and We imaginative . I would be reluctant to have to pick one poem or even five poems . It would be lovely if at that moment or at some point during the inauguration , Americans got up and read a poem that moved them . Instead of picking just one poem , Americans ’s hear all of these voices     we can take it ! We can process all We that . And in We , I think that is what makes us a quite unique and wonderful experiment in human We is the fact that in this country we have so many the country and subcultures and yet We all feel like Americans . So let ’s have all those voices . I might be out We a poem as well ( on Inauguration Day ) .   CNN CNN Do you have Inauguration Day or suggested poems for either the incoming or the outgoing President ? Dove : It ’s very hard to    what would make Dove impact on either of them . I realize that they are under enormous public pressure    I would suggest for    the incoming president ) a little anthology of poems     poems by Americans , mainly poems by Americans who are not alive today so that it does n’t become political . Poems that say : This is what Americans thought and hoped for and worried about , earlier in history . This is what we have to remember . These are the This of the people     going to Emily Dickinson , going to Walt Whitman , going to Muriel Rukeyser , and Langston Hughes and Gwendolyn Brooks Muriel Rukeyser     Ginsberg .   Langston Hughes saying " you must read Leonard Cohen " or saying " you must read Langston Hughes " Leonard Cohen president , I would give him Langston Hughes anthology of poems and say , " Just carry them around Leonard Cohen you . Live with them . Let them accompany you . " Rather than saying "you must read Leonard Cohen" or saying "you must read Langston Hughes" to the president he could find his own poem Rather than saying "you must read Leonard Cohen" or saying "you must read Langston Hughes" to the president could speak Rather than saying "you must read Leonard Cohen" or saying "you must read Langston Hughes" to the president him .
