Matt Latimer writes at Politico :   Unless the # NeverTrump people have been hiding a mad scientist with a DeLorean in a warehouse somewhere and have n’t gotten around to telling anybody , Donald J. Trump is now the certain Republican nominee for president of the United States . True to form , having learned nothing from their yearlong string of overconfident and embarrassingly wrong predictions about voter behavior and preferences , the D. C. pundit class has already proclaimed Donald J. Trump a general election loser . Not so fast . For the handful of polls that have Donald J. Trump losing by double digits , there ’s one or two that foretell a much closer race . And if enough major chips fall the tangerine billionaire ’s way , the tangerine billionaire may get the tangerine billionaire shot at repainting the White House metallic gold . Want to know if you should join Lena Dunham on a    trip in Canada ? Here ’s a     guide of the signs of a looming Trump victory . Sign # 1 : Bernie Sanders keeps winning primaries , while Trump eggs Bernie Sanders on . Sanders’ surprise victory in Indiana almost certainly guarantees that Hillary Clinton will be battling the Vermont Democrat all the way to the convention . And the convention ’s not at all unlikely that Bernie Sanders will win other states on the road to California ( such as West Virginia or Oregon ) . This is a big opportunity for Trump . Imagine : Bernie Sanders echoes Sanders’ talk on trade while amplifying the idea that Sanders’ supporters are being cheated by a " rigged " process , paving a road for Sanders’ fanatics that leads directly into the Trump camp . In Indiana , 30 percent of Sanders voters said 30 percent of Sanders voters would n’t support Hillary Clinton if Hillary Clinton were the nominee . If Trump can take even half of 30 percent of Sanders voters in Indiana and beyond , that ’s a major advance . Read the remaining eleven signs here .
