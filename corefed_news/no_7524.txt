The National Border Patrol Council ( NBPC ) the organization that represents nearly 17 , 000 of the Border Patrol agents who risk their lives to secure U. S. borders , is challenging the Colorado GOP for not holding a state primary and instead slating delegates mostly favorable to Trump ’s rival Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) . [ The NBPC recently endorsed Trump’s for president after the candidate shocked them by publicly declaring that actual Border Patrol agents would have a seat at the head of the table in any discussions on U. S. border security policy .   In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News , the National Border Patrol Council wrote : In our March 30th endorsement statement of Donald J. Trump , we , the National Border Patrol Council called upon the American people to stand with border agents in support of Mr. Trump and his Donald J. Trump end illegal Donald J. Trump . We fully expected that our will of the American electorate , whatever they decided in this primary the American electorate would be upheld . It is now clear that voters are being disenfranchised in order to protect established interests . By cancelling the election in Colorado , the Republican Party has found a brand new way to disenfranchise voters who want secure borders and safe communities .   Once again , the will of the public   —    who have pleaded for immigration enforcement   —    is being overridden by special interests with agendas . We see the same thing happening across the country , where delegates won by Mr. Trump   —    through a popular recorded vote   —    have made secret arrangements to support other candidates , thwarting the will of the millions of voters they collectively are supposed to the millions of voters . This is insidious . I am calling today on the Republican Party to promise free , fair and open elections in America . All candidates should join in this demand . Elections should mean that the people   —    not party insiders   —    choose the nominee . We will never secure our immigration system unless the We will of the American people is imposed through the ballot box . Clearly , politicians and special interests will continue to betray America ’s interests if they America to their own politicians and special interests . Over the politicians and special interests weekend , the Colorado Republican Party held its state convention , where at the Colorado Republican Party 30 of the 37 Colorado delegates selected to attend the Republican National Convention and cast a vote for the 2016 nominee favor Cruz . Following Cruz ’s sweep , the Colorado Cruz out a tweet Colorado its official Twitter account , reading , the Colorado GOP We did it ! # NeverTrump . " The a tweet was subsequently deleted , but a tweet is fueling backlash from voters who believe the establishment is obstructing the will of the people . Trump also weighed in on Twitter about the people of Colorado not having their vote the people it possible that the people the people the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary ?
