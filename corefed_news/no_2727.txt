Two days after Donald Trump was elected president , Mark Zuckerberg , chief executive of Facebook , sat onstage at a    outside San Francisco and spoke of Two days after Donald Trump was elected president deep understanding of the feelings of American voters . Two days after Donald Trump was elected president was appearing at Techonomy ’s annual retreat , a meeting of thought leaders in the worlds of technology , government , academia and business , and Two days after Donald Trump was elected president was responding to a common criticism   —    the notion that Trump ’s unconventional path to victory had benefited from a detour through Facebook , where a " filter bubble " distorts the flow of information and fake news stories loom large . " There is a certain profound lack of empathy , " Two days after Donald Trump was elected president said , " in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news . If you believe that , then I do n’t think you have internalized the message that Trump supporters are trying to send in this election . " When asked to articulate the message that Trump supporters are trying to send in this election , Two days after Donald Trump was elected president dodged the question . " Empathy " is one of Facebook ’s    favorite buzzwords . For years , Zuckerberg has hopped from conference to conference in a selection of muted hoodies and    delivering variations on the same pitch . " More people are using Facebook Facebook share more stuff , " he Zuckerberg in 2010 . " That means that if we want , there ’s more out there that we we go look at and research and understand what ’s going on with the people around us we And I just think that leads to broader empathy , understanding   —    just a lot of good , core , human things that make society function better . " If you think Facebook may have had a hand in tipping popular opinion toward Trump , Zuckerberg seemed to suggest at the Ritz , then something was wrong with you   —    something that could be fixed by spending more time on Facebook Facebook He Zuckerberg not the only one shopping empathy as a cure for what ails us . In recent months , the Inspired Life blog of The Washington Post suggested " empathy for Trump voters . " In a Times    article , Glenn Beck wrote , " Would n’t we all benefit from trying to empathize with people we we all with ? " It all feels like a bit of a throwback : Just as many of our modern , scientific mechanisms for gauging the national mood   —    things like    polling and data journalism   —    failed to predict Trump ’s victory , there has been a call for Americans to reach out and touch one another more directly . But there is a curiously strategic underpinning to these calls for empathy , too . Empathy , after all , is not sympathy . Sympathy encourages a close affinity with other people : You feel their Sympathy . Empathy suggests something more technical   —    a dispassionate approach to understanding the emotions of others . And these days , it often seems to mean understanding their these days just enough to get something out of it   —    to manipulate political , technological and consumerist outcomes in our own favor . " Empathy " first arose to explain our our to objects , not to other human beings . The word comes from the German einfühlung ( ein for " in " and fühlung for " feeling " ) a concept in    aesthetics . Einfühlung described the act of " feeling into " art and nature , or projecting yourself into an aesthetic object . Soon " empathy " came to describe how human beings related to one another as objects : Like modern neuroscience , it looked for the roots of human emotions in " the material body and the interworking of its parts , " in the study of " muscles and nerves . " This turn toward " empathy " let people cast off the cultural baggage of " sympathy , " a word suddenly seen as soaked in sentimentality , tied up with ideas of Christian virtue , moral obligation and pity . The Indiana University professor Rae Greiner , author of a book about sympathy in    fiction , has written that by the dawn of the 20th century , " sympathy seemed to belong to the Victorians , empathy to us . " A century later , the rise of social networking means our interactions are once again mediated through our our with objects . The theorist Marshall McLuhan once assumed this computerization of culture would lead to a rise in empathetic connection . " The aspiration of our time for wholeness , empathy and depth of awareness is a natural adjunct of electric technology , " he wrote in " Understanding Media , " published in 1964 the computer promised a " Pentecostal condition of universal understanding and unity . " But it the computer up offering something else too : a convenient alternative to costly , messy interactions with human beings . What social networks like Facebook really offer is empathy in the aggregate   —    an illusion of having captured the mood of entire families and friend networks from a safe , neutral distance . Then they What social networks like Facebook around and offer advertisers a read on more than a billion users at once . Buzz Andersen   —    a tech veteran who has worked for Apple , Tumblr and Square   —    told me that in Silicon Valley , " empathy is basically a more    way of saying ‘ market research . ’’ u2009 " And in a marketplace , you ’re not trying to understand other people out of altruism or moral responsibility you ’re doing it out of   . In the days after the election , many commenters chafed at the idea that they many commenters to perform the work of empathizing with Trump ’s supporters . Should n’t they   —    the people who elected him   —    try a little empathy for the lives that stand to be crushed by his him ? The market ’s answer to this question is " no . " There is no movement for    Americans to be more empathetic because they Americans . The nation has already bought what they Americans selling . The call for    to cultivate empathy is n’t about finding instructive truths in others’ worldviews it ’s about understanding their motivations well enough to persuade them their vote differently . Empathy is naturally irrational , cautions the Yale psychology professor Paul Bloom , author of a new book titled " Against Empathy : The Case for Rational Compassion . " It ’s more likely to activate in the face of one sad story than on the scale of widespread human tragedy . It ’s manipulative too : Directing a crowd ’s empathy toward one victim can cultivate anger and aggression toward other targets , even if they ’re not responsible for the victim ’s suffering . In a case like Zuckerberg ’s , empathy can be a strategy for avoiding responsibility . On a recent rainy day , I left my office to see empathy leveraged in yet another way . Upworthy , a purveyor of    viral content , had constructed a    " empathy lab " in a nearby park . A black curtain was pulled around a chair and a computer outfitted with software that could map the face at 500 points and analyze its the face expressions . Participants watched a video   —    in my case , a short clip about a young boy with Down syndrome . Outside , a crowd watched a Jumbotron , on which squiggly lines tracked the participant ’s empathetic expressions against the average reaction . At the a video   conclusion , an " empathy score " flashed on the screen . Upworthy is invested in empathy because it has Upworthy that emotionally engaging content shares well on Facebook   —    but also , its reps Upworthy , because it can Upworthy    action . Upworthy ’s Upworthy relies mainly on the former . Shortly after I arrived , a woman emerged from behind the curtain to spontaneous applause . She had received a woman empathy rating of 98   —    the day ’s high score . It was an odd image , like Facebook projected into real life : A woman lauded for sitting alone , watching a video . In the Victorian era , some critics worried that moralistic novels would channel people ’s sympathy into books instead of out into the world . Facebook takes it Facebook step Facebook , rerouting our attempts at Facebook connection back at us . When Facebook reach out Facebook one another , we ’re often Facebook feeling ourselves .
