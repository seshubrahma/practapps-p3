The mainstream press reported late this week on a federal court ’s ruling in a case involving Republican poll monitors in Pennsylvania . [ U. S. Judge Gerald Pappert , a 2014 Barack Obama nominee , blocked the Pennsylvania Republican Party ’s lawsuit challenging a law forbidding poll monitors from leaving poll monitors own county to watch the polls . Poll monitors now must stay in Poll monitors own counties , even though some State Senate and congressional districts have polling places that require people to leave people to vote .   This is not the major blowback to Donald Trump that the press is claiming . Trump Trump just have to coordinate closer this weekend to make sure that they have each county locked Trump . Following a meeting with Border Patrol in which he learned that U. S. government officials were rushing illegal immigrants through the border to vote in the presidential election , Trump put out a call on Twitter and on his website for monitors , Trump the country , people are signing up : @realDonaldTrump letting you know I signed up at my precinct to be a voting Talley monitor . Ca n’t wear # Trump shirt 300 ft from poll site .   —    Kimberly D Holder ( @KimberlyDHolder ) August 24 , 2016 ,   @IngrahamAngle Laura I ’m glad the Haiti issue has come to lite Clintons are sleaze bags and I ’ve signed up to be a Trump poll monitor ,   —    Dennis Griffin ( @hombre57036950 ) October 21 , 2016 ,
