His and subsequent governments had favored a handful of    conglomerates with tax benefits , lucrative business licenses and    and    policies his The his were accused of returning the favors with bribes and suspicious donations . Through the years , top corporations have been rocked by recurring corruption scandals , including the one that implicated Ms. Park and her confidante , Choi   . In 1988 , business tycoons were hauled into a parliamentary hearing to be questioned about millions of dollars they gave to a foundation controlled by the military dictator Chun   . The scene was repeated this week , when nine business leaders , business tycoons Jay Y.
