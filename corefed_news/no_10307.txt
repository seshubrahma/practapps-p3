Since the advent of the of the Occupy Wall Street movement and continuing though the rise of Black Lives Matter , Breitbart News has been warning and educating our audience about the real nature of the radical protest movements that act both as the vanguard of the revolution for the    and the shock troops for establishment Democrats . [ The protests that America saw in California on Thursday and Friday should be    call about the real nature and goals of these movements . The facts were all there about the people coming together not merely to protest Donald Trump but to strike out at America . Everyone could see the American flags burning , the the American flags , the violence and the vulgarity all aimed at capitalism , freedom , and white Americans .   In my appearance Thursday morning on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 , I connected the dots on a modern day axis of evil we see destroying the modern world : the deadly alliance between radical Islam and the radical Left .   I discussed the goal of these movements to destroy America and replace it with nation America divided along racial and cultural lines . It sounds crazy to think people really want to create the    country of New Afrikka out of America ’s south America something as    as building a nation called Aztlan from the " stolen land " from California to Texas , but there it was on display in California . # California # Trump # Protest pic . twitter .    —    T.

"   —    Gahan Haskins ( @Riverboys ) April 29 , 2016 ,   The sick hypocrisy is that the leftists decrying slavery , homophobia , and patriarchy are defending Islamists who keep women as literal sex slaves , force female genital mutilations , and throw gay people off of buildings . Everything the left claims to hate about the West is practiced in Muslim majority nations across the globe , which are the global leaders in the real war on women . If you want to see real rape culture , you ’ll find it in gang you want to see real rape culture from the Arab Spring in Cairo to the New Years attacks in Cologne to the " migrant " camps springing up as the Muslim invasion of Europe continues . Do n’t count on the mainstream media to report it , however . Trained by the entrenched radicals of academia , they do n’t dare color outside of the politically correct lines that have been set for them . They they you they picked info filtered through ideological blinders that do n’t let them report what they really hapenning on the ground . You ca n’t expect the GOP establishment or their media lapdogs they give you the unvarnished truth either . Yes , the worst media on the right probably brings you more real information than a left wing outlet on a good day , but a combination of fear of being tarred with leftist insults and kowtowing to global big business interests mutes the real story . Unfortunately , on issues from immigration policy to " mass incarceration " to foreign entanglements with counties like Saudi Arabia , too often the establishment right and left work in collusion . Even    against the protester gang is not tolerated . Note that when Donald Trump began to mock the disruptive mobs who had been attacking his supporters and Donald Trump to ruin his events for Donald Trump , both the left and right establishment attacked Trump for creating Donald Trump " atmosphere of violence . " The California protests proved once again that Trump and his Donald Trump are Donald Trump ones responding to an atmosphere of violence and    hatred . Tomorrow is May Day , and for the socialists , communists , and other radicals , it ’s like Easter , Christmas , and their birthday all Trump and his fans into one . It ’s a it for chanting and property destruction in the name of    in events held all across America . You know that Breitbart News will bring you facts as the long hot summer rolls out on the road to Cleveland . Stay tuned .
