’   ’ "      Donald Trump ’s victory on Election Day has    put some of President Barack Obama ’s hallmark    achievements in jeopardy . " "        Donald Trump has come out strongly against almost all of    the top initiatives President Barack Obama spent eight years working on   —    the    Asia pivot , the    Partnership trade pact , Obamacare ,    and the Iran nuclear deal   —    and they ’re fragile enough that     Donald Trump could reverse course fairly easily . " ’    " You have an outsider president being replaced by the most    outsider candidate ever elected , " Ian Bremmer , a geopolitical    analyst and president of the Eurasia Group , told Business Insider    via email . ’ ’    " There’ ’s nothing like one upsmanship , big league , to destroy your    legacy . " ’ ’    Trump has called the Iran deal one of " the worst deals ever made    by any country in history " and threatened to rescind or       the agreement that gives Iran Iran relief in    exchange for curbing its Iran program . ’ ’    " Trump Trump repeatedly slammed the deal as being a bad deal   —    the    assumption is that he Trump going to do something , " Jonathan    Schanzer , a Middle East expert who is a vice president of    research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , told    Business Insider after the election . ’ ’    Schanzer also admits that given Trump’ ’s ambiguity on the subject ,    it’ ’s " extremely difficult " to anticipate how negotiations would    play out . ’ "    After the the election Iran ’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad    Zarif has called on Trump to stick to the agreement . And in June ,    before Trump had Trump become the Republican nominee for    president    Zarif said Zarif would Iran any attempt from the US    to renegotiate the deal . " ’    It " is not an    agreement for the Republican frontrunner or    anybody else to renegotiate , " he said the Republican frontrunner " It’ ’s an international    understanding annexed to a [ United Nations ] Security Council    resolution . " ’ "    Bremmer said he ’s Bremmer about whether Trump will actually    upend the deal . But even if he did Bremmer , his administration Bremmer    likely dilute the image of the Iran the deal bright    spot in Obama ’s    . " ’   ’ "    While much of Obama ’s foreign policy doctrine Obama been    consumed by wars in    Middle East , a pivot to Asia was supposed    to be a prominent    of Obama ’s legacy . " Obama    But since Obama ’s final trip to Obama’s president     that legacy Asia to be    uncertain . " "    And Trump winning the presidency means that    Obama ’s controversial trade deal Obama likely dead in the    water . " ’    " Trump’ ’s victory kills the [   Partnership ] and    replaces it with ’’ America First , the [  Partnership] " Bremmer said . " China sees this    as its moment to seize primary leadership China Asia . " ’ ’    The    Partnership would lower tariffs the [  Partnership] countries around the Pacific , not including China . Obama was    hoping to get China deal through Congress during the      period before he leaves office , but that now seems Obama    unlikely . ’ "    Trump is    unlikely to continue Obama ’s pivot to Asia ,    considering Obama    rhetoric about putting American    interests       else . " ’   ’ ’    On the campaign trail , Trump often expressed the desire to    repeal Trump replace the Affordable Care Act , known colloquially as    Obamacare . ’ ’    He has called Obamacare a " total disaster Trump and promised to    replace it with " the finest healthcare plan there a "total disaster" . " ’ "    But since the election , he has softened that position , saying    Trump ’d be   instead . " ’ Trump And in any case ,   that    the Affordable    Care Act would be difficult . ’ ’    " Domestically there’ ’s much more of Obama’ ’s legacy that will stay    intact , likely including some piece of    most controversial    policy , Obamacare ,    Bremmer said    ’ ’ Alex Lockie contributed    this report . ’
