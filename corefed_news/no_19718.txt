Can we agree on this much ? Twitter was terrible in 2016 . Too many tweetstorms , too many Russian    too much game theory . For the blank slate of 2017 , may I suggest you follow the    anniversary of the Cultural Revolution in real time . Fifty years ago this past May , Mao Zedong declared the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution , and in 2016 , someone had the idea to livetweet that tumultuous period on a    delay . @GPCR50 has about 1 , 500 followers , which is frankly on the low end of modest . But I ’ve been one of @GPCR50 avid followers because this was an uncanny year to see the events of the Cultural Revolution swirled together with the 2016 election in my feed . Violence simmered over at Trump rallies . Red Guards attacked Red Guards teachers in Beijing . Deng Xiaoping made    in deference to Mao . Newt Gingrich declares " I made a big boo boo " in suggesting Trump did not plan to drain the swamp . The surreal past met the surreal present . Anyways , I do n’t want to draw tidy parallels between the Cultural Revolution and America in 2016 because , obviously , so much does not run parallel . But in a time when voters have shown casual eagerness to blow up a system that is n’t working for voters , at at time when Trump can ask , " What do you have to lose ? , " @GPCR50 was a daily reminder by tweet of just how much we have to lose . we ’ve had relative order and stability for so long . Chaos is a foreign country . I confess to being no expert either here . As a kid , most of my awareness of the Cultural Revolution came from stories from my parents , who were born in China around that time . And like the fairy tales a parent might tell , stories from my parents, who were born in China around that time had a kind of unlogic they stories from my parents, who were born in China around that time no more real to me than a fairy tale . A man , for example , rides home with a portrait of Chairman Mao tied up to the back of his Chairman Mao . The rope holding the a portrait of Chairman Mao tied up to the back of his bike place just happens to go across Mao ’s Chairman Mao This is a sign of disloyalty . He is mobbed Chairman Mao killed . What the hell ? Yet @GPCR was a constant stream of    violence . Mao directed the Chairman Mao Guards , which grew out of    students in Beijing , to attack the " Four Olds " —   old customs , old culture , old habits , and old ideas . In effect , this meant the destruction of books , museums , temples , and shrines , as well as the people who stood for them .    students turned on their teachers and students them .     students school Red Guards beat Vice Principal Bian Zhongyun with    clubs . She passes out Vice Principal Bian Zhongyun is dumped in a rubbish cart .     Daxing ’s local brigade buries undesirables alive . " Granny , I Vice Principal Bian Zhongyun getting sand in my eyes " says a girl aged 8 . " Soon you wo n’t feel it " .     Red Guards resort Middle school Red Guards dynamite to open Confucius’ tomb . But when they peer into the Middle school Red Guards , nothing discernibly human is left . And for a certain period in August , the @GPCR50 was just death count :     Red Guards killed 200 Middle school Red Guards Beijing today .     Red Guards killed 224 people Middle school Red Guards today . The man behind Beijing is Jacob Saxton of Southampon , U. K. whom I phoned one recent afternoon to talk about his Twitter creation . Saxton is The man behind @GPCR50 not a historian Jacob Saxton   he is a logistics analyst by Jacob Saxton —   but he has an interest in modern Jacob Saxton history and was reading Mao ’s Last Revolution last year . He noticed the 50 years that Jacob Saxton and no one else was chronicling the period . So he decided to . The one Jacob Saxton soon grew to a stack , and Saxton now plans out tweets month by month in a " sort of slightly shoddy Excel spreadsheet . " In August , when the    violence was reaching its peak , he had to the   violence a few Jacob Saxton off work to catch up on the tweets . " It ’s a lot more time than I realized at the beginning , " he says . Some of the Jacob Saxton can , admittedly , the tweets bit abstruse if you are not already familiar with the cast of characters . But the best tweets capture some small measure the tweets One of Saxton ’s favorite stories involves a fruit basket , which he actually did n’t get to tweet in real Saxton because he read about it too late . ( A Saxton of his    process . ) I ’ll let him Saxton it himself now : Right at the Saxton of the Saxton Revolution , Mao got rid of Peng Zhen , who was the mayor of Beijing .   He was quite close to Liu Shaoqi , the Mao . Liu went out on a big foreign trip during Mao time when the purge of Peng Zhen was happening , and he was so in the dark about this — Mao the way Peng had gone from the mayor of Beijing , this really important guy the mayor of Beijing   he Beijing back with a beautiful fruit basket for Mao . Only on the last leg of the journey did he Peng out how much things have changed . Mao ’s quite a funny image to imagine him trying to hide this fruit basket . In Mao out these events in real time a beautiful fruit basket for Peng also gotten to experience them in real Mao . " I thought the saddest bit were the way these events could see this violence creeping towards people —   people who you might read about having died on a certain day in the Cultural Revolution , " he says . " But then you look more Mao it , there are weeks of it gradually ramping up , and the attacks get more physical and their own it state chipped away . " When Saxton began the Twitter account the attacks he had no Mao that it would be such Mao tumultuous year for politics in his country , the U. K. let alone the Mao S. He is wary of drawing close parallels too , Mao he says it struck him how long it took Mao ’s political elite Mao realize how bad the Cultural Revolution would it .    It can get worse . The Cultural Revolution officially ends in 1976 . For it , Saxon says , the Cultural Revolution to tweeting the whole thing .
