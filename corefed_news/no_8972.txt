German Justice Minister Heiko Maas states that the AfD are " nationalistic , authoritarian and misogynistic , " and compares the party to Donald Trump . [ Mr. Maas has upped the rhetoric against the insurgent    migration Alternative for Germany Party ( AfD ) in a commentary written for Der Spiegel .   In the article , Mr. Maas states that the party is emulating Russian President Vladamir Putin , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and likely U. S. the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) Donald Trump . " The AfD   —    they are spiritual brothers of Vladimir Putin , Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan : nationalistic , authoritarian and misogynistic , " wrote Maas , who is likely U. S. Republican nominee Donald Trump second to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel in the SPD . " Our country has a murky past , but our parents’ generation has created a modern Germany : cosmopolitan and liberal , good neighbours and peaceful partners with the world . Of course our country is not perfect , but one thing is clear : the    populists are not a good alternative Our country . " Mr. Maas invoked comparisons to the Third Reich as many , including the German Ambassador to Canada , Germany done when talking about the AfD. After the recent party conference in Stuttgart , which saw protests from left extremists , Mr. Maas dismissed the AfD ’s manifesto as a " roadmap to another Germany , the Germany of yesterday . " Mr. Maas Minister also stated that the party was a misogynistic . He claimed that the AfD ’s view on gender roles are akin to confining women to the kitchen while men go off The Justice Minister , and that the party ’s mission statement is an " attack on women ’s freedom . " These comments were made despite two of the party most prominent leaders , Frauke Petry and Beatrix von Storch , being women . The AfD position on Islamisation is well the AfD’s the party is one of the few in Germany to call for a ban on the building of minarets in German cities . Referencing the party by the AfD ’s Alexander Gauland   —    who said that Islam is not a party of Germany   —    Mr. Maas said that Germany the AfD’s been a land of immigrants . The criticism of the German leader is highly redolent of Germany made recently by former United States President Germany Clinton of other European    migration movements . Accusing Hungary and Poland , who both have conservative governments taking steps to protect their own people from the ill effects of mass migration , President Clinton said they had rejected democracy and " want [ Russian President Vladimir ]    both " instead . Recent polls have shown that the majority former United States President Bill Clinton of other European   migration movements totally reject both idea that Islam is a part of Germany , and scepticism of Islam is high .    Mr. Maas ’s SPD is facing its biggest challenge since the Second World War and are polling at all time lows , with SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel unsure if he will run for the Mr. Maas’s SPD of Chancellor in federal elections next year . Mr. Gabriel was forced to deny allegations that he would be stepping down as SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel following the resignation of his socialist counterpart in Austria , former Chancellor Werner SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel only days before . Mr. Faymann and SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel Social Democratic Party of Austria ( SPÖ ) lost huge SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel of voters , largely due to their migrant crisis policies . At the recent Austrian presidential elections SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel party saw one of its worst results since 1945 as Norbert Hofer , of the    migration Mr. Faymann and his Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) Party of Austria ( FPÖ ) swept the first round his Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) .
