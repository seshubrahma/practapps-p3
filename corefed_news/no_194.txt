This is just a guess , but the    programming that is all over television at the moment feels as if it might go largely unwatched . The offerings are generally some combination of    retrospective and        analysis . Do admirers of President Obama really want to revisit President Obama slow slide from 2008 triumph to 2017 vilification ? Do fans of the    Donald J. Trump , want to do anything other than say , " Do n’t let the door hit you on the way out " and then plunge into fans of the   Donald J. Trump new opportunity ? That said , let That see if we can find any reason to watch two of this week ’s programs : four hours’ worth of " Frontline " on PBS titled " Divided States of America , " and a CNN production , " The End : Inside the Last Days of the Obama White House . " The " Frontline , " which is being broadcast in    chunks on Tuesday and Wednesday nights , is a rehashing of recent history that is for the most part all too familiar , a drumbeat of events that led to a government and a country defined by polarization . Large stretches of it are n’t particularly enlightening   —    who needs to relive the dreary , predictably acrimonious battles over budget stalemates and health care , or to hear sound bites of    radio stars fanning the flames of racism and hate ? The structure of this trip down memory lane does n’t make The structure of this trip down memory lane any more palatable . Michael Kirk , who made the documentary , is largely content to let the usual talking heads be the guides   —    journalists , political operatives , lawmakers or former lawmakers . Some of political operatives, lawmakers or former lawmakers are from the same chattering class that failed to grasp the rise of Mr. Trump in the first place . Hindsight wisdom of this sort seems especially out of place now . As for the ordinary Americans who put Mr. Trump in the White House , we hear them the ordinary Americans who put Mr. Trump in the White House in    clips that only reinforce the easy stereotypes about them the ordinary Americans who put Mr. Trump in the White House Despite those criticisms , the program does manage to weave a convincing tapestry of discontent , and not just from the obvious threads . Have you forgotten , say , the odd 2009 incident in which Henry Louis Gates Jr. the Harvard scholar , who is black , was arrested after having to force his way into his his home because of a jammed door ? This the program n’t , and places it in the program context of the growing schism that ultimately made Mr. Obama a divider rather than a uniter . So the documentary , though it ’s the program particularly rewarding to watch , does achieve its goal the program painting a portrait of a country that is about as disunited as it could be , thanks to economic forces , increasingly unveiled racism and an anger that continues to be hard to pin down . President Obama Mr. Obama    pronouncement that the country is America collection of red states and blue states , but is " and always will be the United States of America " is heard here . By the program ’s end , it has never seemed the program naïve . The CNN program , Wednesday night , is the better of the two , capturing a lot of honesty as it follows staff members in the Obama White House during their final days . staff members in the Obama White House has partisan stretches it of course , but its most interesting passages it a study of what has to happen to transfer the government from one group of handlers to another , regardless of who is transferring to whom . To watch this program is to be impressed with the magnitude of what will happen this week . " It ’s the largest this program of any organization not only on the planet but in history , " says Max Stier of the Partnership for Public Service , an organization focused on improving government effectiveness . Then he notes why it Max Stier especially important this program . " The point of maximum vulnerability for our nation is at the transition , " he says , " Max Stier in a     world , doing this really well is vital . "
