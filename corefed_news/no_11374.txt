Monday on ABC ’s " The View , " while discussing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s first TV ad ,    Whoopi Goldberg lobbied viewers to get out and vote so that Republican presidential    Donald Trump is n’t elected .   Guest    Sunny Hostin said , " You know what concerns me most about the ad ? And I ’ve seen the ad a couple times . the ad ’s fear mongering and I think   Whoopi Goldberg has tapped into perhaps thousands or hundreds of thousands of people who are operating by fear and under fear and that is really , really disconcerting . That should n’t be the country that we are . " Joy Behar said , " But it always works . In my day , remember this , when Lyndon Johnson , I believe this was Lyndon Johnson against Goldwater and they used a mushroom cloud and everybody was scared . they use fear all the time in politics . "    said , " A lot of Republicans are doing it right now . Lindsey Graham and Christie are saying it and it ’s really sad . " Sunny Hostin said , " it ’s sad and vulgar . I do n’t think Hostin ’s such a smart guy , quite frankly . I think Hostin reads a good crowd . I think Hostin reads a crowd and Hostin ’s tapped into all of these people and these people ’re believing Hostin . " Goldberg said , " Goldberg ’s tapped into the white supremacists who have endorsed Hostin . Goldberg ’s tapped into a lot of folks whose idea of America is not America idea of America America Quite frankly , you want to fear monger , okay , but you better call a spade a spade man . When you see terrorists , you better name them terrorists you see them terrorists Not just saying radical . You need that word ? Radical Islam , okay , yeah , there are radical Islamic terrorists . I think everyone has said it a million times . But what there also is is a lot of racists in the world , and we got to name them as well . I think   —    you know , this is still America . This is still America America This This a land where people come for a better life . " She added , " I think that the idea of going backwards to the ’50 s and the ’40s is not a good way to go . Quite frankly , I ’m imploring everybody , get out and vote . I do n’t care what your background is . This is   —    you know , listen , be an Independent , be a Republican , be a Democrat . Get out there , make sure people are voting because the idea that we are building walls and pointing to a group of people and painting them a group of people one brush , I ’ve been there . We we all been there . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
