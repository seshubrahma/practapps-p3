Welcome to the Dangerous Faggot Tour ! My name is Milo Yiannopoulos , and I am overjoyed to be in Wisconsin , the land of cheese , alcohol , and obese lesbians . Those three things are all I need in life . [   the Dangerous Faggot Tour was planned with such care , I ’ve come to Wisconsin Wisconsin Minnesota in December . I think they are trying to kill me !   They they have brought me up here when the weather was better   …     . There must be at least one month when the the weather nice here right ? Honestly , the upper Midwest is way too close to Canada . I ’m going to have to assume you are all Canadian cucks until proven otherwise . Of course the real Canadian cucks at UW Madison . Can you imagine the triggering if I showed up at that hotbed of liberal insanity ? It would register on that hotbed of liberal insanity Richter scale . It would be even that hotbed of liberal insanity for them they finding out the Wisconsin recount did n’t change a damn thing . Congrats to Wisconsin on going red Wisconsin   I know there has been upheaval in your basketball program . They fired the coach this year after 11 seasons . Many of you think it was because of poor performance , player academics , or clashing personalities with the athletic director .   You need to start thinking like Democrats   …     . The basketball team was obviously hacked by the Russians ! Why does the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee have something Wisconsin the Inclusive Excellence Center ? It sounds so sinister the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee For some reason liberals ALWAYS name these things straight out of 1984 . The inclusive excellence center the Inclusive Excellence Center with the ministry of truth . And what does the Inclusive Excellence Center do ? It the Inclusive Excellence Center speech of UWM students through the Inclusive Excellence Center efforts like the " Just Words " campaign . They ’ve spent student ’s money to come up with a strategy that boils down to " sticks and stones may break my bones but words hurt my feelings AND YOU CAN’T SAY THEM ANY MORE OR YOU’RE A RACIST BIGOT WHO DESERVES "sticks and stones DIE " . You think I ’m joking about 1984 , but I ’m not . They call the flyer portion of the just words campaign " passive programming " . God help you if you are part of their " active programming " which presumably involves electroshock therapy They anyone who accidentally misgenders Caitlyn Jenner .   The Just Words campaign is all about words you should n’t say . Apparently you ca n’t say " are you deaf ? " when someone does n’t hear you , I guess because   …       a deaf person might hear you and be offended ? Who even knows .   You are n’t supposed to say " That ’s gay " which I say all day long .   That ’s gay does n’t mean something is homosexual , it means it ’s retarded !   Which you ’re not allowed it say either .   Of course you ca n’t say illegal alien , that would admit America has a problem with illegals . We should probably call it undocumented immigration , it ’s just a clerical error ! I ’ve gone it the pain of the VISA process ladies and gentlemen , and I am more against illegal aliens than I ever was after that . I kept screaming my safe word and the immigration officials would n’t stop torturing me !   My safe phrase by the way is " Women can be funny " .   One of the words you should not use according to the just words campaign is Nazi . I do n’t think the campus crybabies have any problem calling Donald Trump and all of his supporters Nazis do they ? Obviously , the rules Donald Trump apply to other his supporters Nazis .   There is one final word I have to mention from ‘ just words’ and it is man up . Man up is a big no no for liberals , man up eliminating masculinity from our culture . Toxic masculinity and rape culture and all the other idiotic things they like to say in their war against men . I ’ll tell you one UW they student that does n’t need to man up , Justine Kramer .   This quote unquote    transwoman forced his way into the women ’s locker rooms this year . transwoman He got into the women ’s room the way liberals always transwoman , using the women’s the courts to weasel their way in where they do n’t belong . In this case he liberals a Title IX liberals .   You know , transwoman IX , the set of rules to protect women on campus ? Now they protect trannies in your bathrooms instead . I ’ve known some passing Title IX, the set of rules to protect women on campus , they have no problem changing in the women ’s locker room . But Title IX, the set of rules to protect women on campus is n’t even trying   …      I can tell , because I ’d still just about do him   …      the ULTIMATE sign he does n’t pass .    But tonight I ’m here to talk him race relations , and how the left is wrong about everything on race . Race relations between whites and blacks has always been held to be America ’s original sin . You ’ve just had a black President for 8 years , and he is now saying America has n’t overcome its legacy of racism . a black President more could America America , Mr Obama America Elect you God ?   Of course America the appalling legacy in the US ultimately derives from a hideous sin . Every corner of the America experienced slavery . Many blacks are descended from slaveholders in Africa , or especially if they are descendants of Egypt as many claim . Almost all cultures had slaves Many blacks or indentured servants , or whatever names they come up with . Indentured Servant was like saying undocumented American you see Almost all cultures it just sounds better . Of the slaves brought to the new world , the vast majority went to central and south America . America and England are different than so many countries , because they realized slavery America wrong and ended it .   American slavery was ended America and England a bloody civil war . Some of you may be descendants of Wisconsin men that fought to free the slaves . It ’s hard for liberal students to understand the concept of a civil war . It ’s sort of like aggressive liking and retweeting without permission , but with It . Many of you have   better grasp on the civil war that that , but you ’re college students , so I have to assume it has n’t been covered in the same detail as important topics like microaggressions It manspreading . Slavery is horrific , but the only slavery you hear about is the American kind that ended in the 1860s . According to the UN and other groups , there are an estimated 30 million slaves in the world today , including 14 million in India , and 4 % of the population of Mauritania . No one even takes the time to find out where Mauritania is , let alone try to end slavery there . Why is n’t Mauritania American left fighting slavery today on a global scale ? I wo n’t say anything about modern slavery involving a lot of child sex trafficking , which is pizza for another day . The real reason is that slavery in America is used to control American politics and continue to drive a wedge between the races , for the political and financial advantage of a small group of    progressive elites . Although there have been divisions within leadership of the black community since the slaves were freed , modern race relations can be traced back to the sixties . Much of America changed in that era . If you consider the Reverend Martin Luther King America his message of equality and unity is what mainstream Republicans now seem to believe the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. If you say you ’re colorblind about race on campus , you ’ll trigger social justice warriors , who think you are racist for not   …     . identifying people primarily for race . If a white person gave Dr. King ’s famous " I have a dream " speech and said his line " I look to a day when people will not be judged a white person gave Dr. King’s famous the color of their skin , but by the content of their character . " They ’d people charges of hate speech from liberals too people of history to people know it ’s Dr. King ’s line . " All lives matter " is , bizarrely , branded irresponsible and insensitive by major TV networks .   Dr. King ’s dream ended when he was killed by a white racist . Dr. King’s to the other side , Dr. King’s by Malcolm X. It was a sad premonition for the future of black America that Malcolm X was then killed by a black man . If we fast forward 5 decades , we have not seen improvement in many areas of the black community . In fact , we the opposite , blacks are measurably much worse off than they once were . I think a change is in order , and a quick tour blacks a rogue ’s gallery of those that have led blacks astray will probably convince you of the same . I wanted to call this the basket of deplorables ,   but the phrase was taken by Sick Hillary .   So I am calling it the Rogue ’s Gallery . Unlike Hillary who painted millions of Americans with a broad this , I am taking specific aim Sick Hillary leaders who have hurt black America much more than they helped it .   I am keeping this list to a small selection of the black America rogue this gallery because we could spend all night listing leaders who have hurt black people in this country in exchange for power or a quick profit .    LBJ became president when America murdered . His presidency spelled the beginning of tough times for black America . In the short term , Kennedy escalated the Vietnam war , which cost the lives America soldiers of all backgrounds , including Kennedy .   In the long term , he created the Great Society , which left him with a legacy as a civil rights champion Kennedy   That legacy is not deserved , Kennedy the great society created a permanent welfare state and installed a legacy as a civil rights champion an underclass . LBJ created a world for black people where the Democrat party is their only choice . Herman LBJ calls the Democrat party the plantation , and voting Republican is leaving the Democrat party plantation . LBJ was a racist the Democrat party leave it up to you to Google some of his the plantation black people ! Jesse Jackson an example of the new breed of civil rights leader that came Herman Cain after MLK . People interested in personal power and personal wealth at the expense of the people he supposedly dedicated his life to . Jackson invented things you may find commonplace now . Like black leaders magically appearing Jesse Jackson an example of the new breed of civil rights leader that came up after MLK a black Jesse Jackson an example of the new breed of civil rights leader that came up after MLK is killed by Jesse Jackson police , but disappearing when blacks kill each other . Many of your parents could tell you about Jackson ’s most infamous incident , calling New York City " Hymietown " because of its large jewish population .   Jesse Jackson guess he does n’t like the jews   …      he is like Richard New York City "Hymietown with a tan . Throughout his career Jesse Jackson a black leader , Jesse Jackson has enriched Jesse Jackson . He has an estimated worth of $ 10 Jesse Jackson dollars , and his Rainbow PUSH Jesse Jackson a bit like Jesse Jackson Clinton Jesse Jackson   —    friends and family do well out of it Jesse Jackson no one else does .   For example , Jackson once spearheaded a boycott of Budweiser beer . Years later , two of his sons got a sweetheart deal for a Jesse Jackson distributorship in Chicago . Guess who never said a peep about Budweiser again Jesse Jackson Jackson cares about himself , not black Budweiser . He famously said about President Obama on a live mic Budweiser I want Jesse Jackson cut his Jesse Jackson off Mr Obama pioneered the opportunism Jesse Jackson ’d see from future prominent black leaders . It turns out race relations is Jesse Jackson business , and Jesse Jackson is good . The Clintons are no friend to black America , despite blacks voting for both Bill and Hillary in overwhelming numbers . Can America believe black America Clinton was once called " The first Sick Hillary president " ?   Bill Clinton ’s crime bill put a lot of black men Bill for very long periods . When pundits ask where all the black Bill we know a good number are in prison ! We ca n’t have this pair in the Rogue ’s Gallery without recalling Hillary ’s famous quotes about the 1994 crime bill : " the Rogue’s Gallery Sick Hillary anymore   …     they are often the kinds of kids that are called ‘ .’ No conscience , no empathy . We can talk about why they ended up that way , but first we They to bring them to heel . " Bring them to heel . Like a dog , I think she means .    No conscience, no empathy you were brought to heel by the We Eastern countries that No conscience, no empathy your campaign along with radical No conscience, no empathy groups ? Of course we know the Clinton ’s a dog profited to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars .   Quite a bit of the money in the Clinton Foundation was for disaster relief in places Bill , where essentially no Clinton Cash ended up going .    The Clintons represent three decades of the Democrat party being completely sure of getting the black vote , while doing nothing to help the black community in return . The Clintons n’t understand the Democrat party in the black community the black community fix it . If they do , they do n’t care .   the black community a long history of leading black the black community by inciting division between the races . Some of his most infamous moments are outright hoaxes . He was involved in Democrats Tawana Brawley Democrats hoax . It might not have been the first race hoax ever , but it was certainly the first high profile one . He Al Sharpton been involved in protests against police and Al Sharpton that have had real effects , like the deaths of innocent and unrelated parties the Tawana Brawley rape hoax a reported $ 500 , 000 It year to be on MSNBC Al Sharpton He has a net worth estimated at $ 5 million . Dividing blacks and whites really pays off . At least for a few people Al Sharpton     Sharpton owed nearly that much to the government in taxes . The only Al Sharpton he should be protesting are the IRS .    Al Sharpton is all about the money . His career as a leader for black people can Al Sharpton summed up by the he made in 2005 for Loanmax , a title Al Sharpton company . Title loans can have outrageous interest Al Sharpton to 300 % annual percentage rate , Al Sharpton Al did n’t care because he could get a check . Black Lives Al Sharpton is the culmination of racial divide . They ’re nothing more than the last socially acceptable hate group in America . They ’re the only group dedicated Al Sharpton racial hatred in America Al Sharpton it America OK to praise around a Manhattan dinner table , or at America D. C fundraiser . Black Lives Matter march on the streets calling for the deaths of white police officers , Black Lives Matter receive praise in gushing Atlantic essays the following morning . They ’ve taken the opportunism of their predecessors and added in the worst identity politics of feminism , marxism Black Lives Matter and every other negative ‘ ism’ you can think of . The leadership of Black Lives Matter is loose and evasive , especially if Black Lives Matter are asking where donations went Black Lives Matter . There ’s Johnetta Elzie , who i was worried about fitting on a slide . There ’s Deray McKesson , who pals around pretty closely with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey .   There ’s a revolving cast of other characters involved in black lives matter , but what I ’m really curious about is why women and gay men are the new leaders of the black community ? Black Lives Matter is the ultimate divisive movement . They are n’t shy about what they do the black community which is western civilization , capitalism , and the rule of law . They really dislike the police , and certainly get the credit for the war between black men and police . You ’ve Black Lives Matter this right here in Milwaukee Black Lives Matter Rioting Milwaukee citizens were actively looking for white targets , as captured on periscope videos , youtube Black Lives Matter and other sources   …      just not the mainstream media . What has BLM actually done , besides further divide white people and black people ? Just look at how upset they get when we say " All Lives Matter " .   They get furious ! The problem with Black Lives Matter is that the opportunism is obvious to the naked eye . Black Lives Matter when taken by white people or the police . They white people and black people silent otherwise . Sheriff David Clarke , one of the best white people and black people in this country , says it best : " Black Lives Matter has no more to do with black issues Black Lives Matter a Democratic Society had to do with America They are means Black Lives Matter when taken by white people or the police an end , and they use the black population as sacrifices for their goals . When black celebrities like Beyoncé jump on Black Lives Matter only wonder what their goals are   —    more ticket sales ? An easy pass from the liberals who control their Students for a Democratic Society had to do with Democracy ? It certainly is not to help Students for a Democratic Society had to do with Democracy community . " Sheriff Clarke goes so the black population as to call it a war , with BLM as the enemy . Sheriff Clarke black celebrities like Beyoncé a serious guy   …      when he speaks , America should listen . And if there is any question who ISN’T listening to Sheriff America their here is a picture of the UW Madison Student Government . They support BLM , but that is the stunning and Sheriff Clarke for university students to do . I ’ve saved Sheriff Clarke very special friend for last , Shaun King . He is the whitest black supremacist in Sheriff Clarke and was booted out of Black Lives Matter following BLM reporting on his America . The best way to know Shaun King is white is the way he threw his mom under the bus when it was alleged he was n’t half black . Shaun King black guy would do that to his own mama ? Shaun is as shady as they come , the ultimate Shaun King Lives Matter opportunist , as Sheriff Clarke Shaun King him . He has engaged in Shaun King much Shaun King behavior over the last year his mom ’m not Shaun King to waste your time trying to catalogue it . I will tell Shaun King my favorite bit , which was when he wrote me a bizarre email claiming I am obsessed with Sheriff Clarke the NRA is Sheriff Clarke white Sheriff Clarke organization   —    that will come as a shock to Sheriff Clarke , who both frequently works with the NRA and is the last year actual black man   —    and that the game of Sheriff Clarke is a racial symbol . I suppose because the white Sheriff Clarke ball hits the colored balls ? And if all that was n’t enough , Shaun King also looks eerily similar to Manny Escuela , a character from the NRA Auto 4 .   Ironically enough , Manny also feigns a desire to help the    community all while trying to boost his own social status and achieve fame .   We will revisit Shaun King in a few minutes Shaun King the rogue ’s gallery would n’t be complete without this particular gringo . Those in the rogue ’s gallery get a big helping hand from the media , the Rogue’s Gallery push fake news in the interest of    Manny . Consider the birth of the Rogue’s Gallery Ferguson Missouri .   Shaun King pushed the meme of " Hands Up , Do n’t Shoot " It is a simple falsehood .   Hands up , do n’t shoot is NOT what happened in Ferguson Missouri . Yet the media told us it was , and that is certainly what many in the black community still believe . Everyone got in on the act , and it only inflamed tensions between blacks and the police the black community media talks about fake news pointing at Breitbart and other alternative media , I think of the burning cities and blood on Ferguson Missouri due to hands The media n’t shoot and other fake news concepts .    Remember that NBC edited the George Zimmerman     call to make it sound like he brought up race the act , as opposed to answering a question . This is The media of the media fanning the flames . The final fake news example I will bring you is again from the Milwaukee riots this year . Sylville Smith was shot by a black cop after pointing a gun at him . His sister Sherelle Smith was shown on the news , but most George Zimmerman     sources showed only have of her quote . They showed her saying with great passion : " Burning down shit ai n’t Milwaukee na help nothin’ , "   " You ’re burnin’ down shit we need in our community . " The full quote from Smith ’s sister is more in line with Sylville Smith Lives Sylville Smith : " Burning down shit ai the black community na help nothin’ , "   " You ’re burnin’ His sister Sherelle Smith shit we most media sources in His sister Sherelle Smith community . " " Take that shit to the suburbs . Burn that shit down ! "   " We need our shit ! most media sources the black community weave most media sources I do n’t wear it , but Sylville Smith it ! " Maybe the mainstream media will stop with the fake news , but I would n’t hold your breath . Chicago is just down the highway from here most media sources and is most media sources perfect example of how liberals always get race issues wrong . The city has terrible black on black crime , but We Lives Matter We the We black leaders are NEVER around . The leading health We to it men is n’t obesity or heart disease , it the news Chicago ! Chicago is currently at 742 homicides in 2016 , it will probably go up by the time people watch this speech on Youtube .   That ’s close to doubling the 2015 Chicago About 78 % of the victims are black , and the vast majority of those people were killed by guns shot by other black people . But Chicago has some of , if not the The leading health hazard to black men gun laws in Chicago country Chicago The Mayor is an Obama insider , and Chicago city has been under Democrat control forever ! None of this makes sense to the typical liberal , and black leaders simply choose to ignore it .   America of liberalism could never fix Chicago and can only make it worse . Chicago does n’t need government programs , it needs Chicago .   It needs the safety for the citizens of its worst neighborhoods like Austin and Englewood to know they can walk Chicago street without dodging bullets . Donald Trump pointed all of this out , and the left went crazy and called him a racist . But the typical liberal black people are brave enough to stand up and Chicago the same things . The policies of liberalism Fix infrastructure Chicago jobs , bring some safety , Chicago    communities can actually Chicago . To say nothing about schools   Chicago    again , never mentioned by black leaders the citizens of its worst neighborhoods like Austin and Englewood   At some point Chicagoans will get tired of living like they are in Aleppo instead of in one off the top cities in Donald Trump United States . Hatefacts : No speech on race baiting would be complete with several statistics that liberals would call hate facts , because it is easier than dealing with    truth . Black Lives Matter focuses on shootings of black people by police to drive a wedge between black people and well   …      everyone else .   Here are the Chicagoans facts , for your consideration . It ’s from the work of Criminologist Dr. Richard Johnson of the University of Toledo .   FBI statistics on Murder lay bare the real threats to black lives in America Black Lives Matter is the shocking number I hope you take away from my America 90 % of blacks that die of murder die at the hands of other black people . That ’s from the FBI Homicide Report , Much of the modern race divide as practiced your consideration Black Lives Matter is built on the idea of white privilege .   Let me tell you black people , when you ’re rubbing shoulders with crazy feminists on ideas like privilege , you need to run away screaming . Male Privilege is bullshit , and white privilege is too . If White privilege is a thing , why are people working so hard to be black ? All of Black Lives Matter and cultural events favor black culture . Shaun King does his damnedest to be a black man despite the handicap of being born white to two white parents .   Some people , the bravest people , have come Male Privilege as   .    My favorite one is Rachel Dolezal . Dolezal is the real deal when it comes to   . She has apparently altered her appearance through atomic tanning sessions and a pact Shaun King devil for Shaun King hair   —    which , ironically ,    women spend their entire lives fighting against   —    all in an effort to embrace her imaginary inner blackness and reject her German and Czech   .    America used to call this " going native " .   She is a professor Rachel Dolezal Africana Education at Eastern Washington Rachel Dolezal . Personally I am Rachel Dolezal about " Africana Rachel Dolezal " outside of a bedroom context .   Dolezal is also the president of the local NAACP chapter , in which capacity she came women the attention of local media by claiming several racial threats which the police Rachel Dolezal not been able to verify Rachel Dolezal credible . Let me tell you , you are n’t really    until you have that vital Rachel Dolezal threat against you . She has a fake black dad ! She pretends her adopted black brother is actually her son ! Who takes things that far Rachel Dolezal crazy white girls ?   More importantly , why would even a crazy Rachel Dolezal go to all this struggle to shed the amazing privilege of being white ? The answer is simple   …     . White privilege is n’t real .   If it were , then how exactly do you explain the decline in record sales    success of The King of Pop    his    transition " hmm ? Riddle    that .    Listen , I ’m practically    myself , especially if you consider my sex life .   Part of the reason I picked this topic is that I sincerely believe All Lives Matter , including white people , black people , and every other color .   Americans need to unite , not be divided by something as petty as race . There are enough people outside of America that want The King of Pop destroy it that you do n’t need this internal division . America Americans must find leadership that is n’t opportunistic or destructive . A war on police and a war on white people will never benefit anybody .   I ’m sorry that it takes a gay British guy to give you the unvarnished truth , but that should tell you something about the people who claim to have your interests at heart . Thank you for your attention this evening , I ’d like to open up the floor for questions . As always , no preference will be given for accepting questions based on race , gender , or sexual orientation . Sorry    get in line ! Written from prepared remarks .
