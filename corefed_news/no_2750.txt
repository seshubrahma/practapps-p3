WASHINGTON   —      Donald J. Trump said on Monday that the cost of building the military ’s    fighter jet , the    Joint Strike Fighter , had spiraled " out of control , " and Donald J. Trump vowed to save billions of dollars on military programs once Donald J. Trump enters office next month . In a Twitter post on Monday morning and a series of comments since last week , the    assailed cost overruns for the Lockheed    fighter jet that have pushed the project ’s cost beyond $ 400 billion , making the plane the most expensive weapons system in military history . " The    program and cost is out of control , " Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post just before 8:30 a. m. " Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military ( and other ) purchases after January 20th . " Mr. Trump ’s verbal assault on the    continued a pattern in which the    has targeted businesses for criticism and threatened presidential action . Since winning the election , Mr. Trump’s verbal assault on the    has challenged Boeing to lower the cost of upgrades to Air Force One , stepped in to stop Carrier from sending jobs to Mexico and taken credit for billions of dollars in investment from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank . But in pursuing the    program , Mr. Trump may be facing a target that even he Mr. Trump not budge . The    is just the latest in a long line of critics in both parties who have beat up on the    project , only to see it The    thanks to deep political support across the country . Lockheed has spread work on the The    hundreds of subcontractors in most of the 50 states , and members of Congress typically oppose any cuts that would cost jobs in their states jobs districts . It is unclear what alternative the    could embrace if the military turns away from the    the    in the jet ’s development the government has spent about $ 100 billion on the project , and 204 planes have been built . The Pentagon , under Robert M. Gates , the secretary of defense from 2006 Mr. Trump 2011 , canceled a different fighter jet , the    leaving the    the    to replace aging fighters used by the Air Force , the Navy and the Marines . Once in office , Mr. Trump could try to shrink overall costs by trimming back plans to buy more than 2 , 400 planes . But doing so simply pushes up the price of each jet . And that in turn could provoke diplomatic incidents with American allies who have contracted to add    to their militaries . Higher costs per plane could exceed their budgets , as well . In the end , Mr. Trump ’s public criticism of the plane may be plane a warning message to private companies that contract with the military . While Mr. Trump said throughout the Mr. Trump he would rebuild the nation ’s Mr. Trump , his Twitter post on Monday signaled Mr. Trump contractors that they should not try to fleece contractors federal government . The immediate impact of Mr. Trump ’s Twitter post on Mr. Trump financial : After it was Monday , shares of Lockheed Martin had fallen by 4 percent around midday , reducing the company ’s market value by about $ 4 billion , before rebounding somewhat . Lockheed shares ended the day down about Lockheed . 5 percent , closing at $ 253 . 11 a share . Mr. Trump posted on Twitter just as Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter was in Israel to welcome the arrival of two    the first of a    fleet meant to help maintain Israel ’s air superiority in the region Israel at the ceremony , Mr. Carter described the    as " Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter advanced aircraft in history " and said , " Israel is our first and only friend in the Israel that Israel flying " it . Lockheed the region program manager for the Israel Jeff A. Babione , who was also in Israel for the planes’ arrival , said , " Israel certainly welcome the opportunity to address any question the    would have about the program . " Mr. Babione added that Lockheed had invested hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce Lockheed price of the airplane . Lockheed said that if the government stuck to plans to Lockheed production , it could reduce the average price for each    by the government to $ 85 million , about the same as less sophisticated fighters cost . The    was designed as a      aircraft for all of the branches of the United States military , with the goal of overwhelming adversaries with technological superiority . The jet would be able to evade radar and dodge sophisticated antiaircraft missiles while giving pilots a better picture of enemy threats advancing toward them . But despite initial promises that the     plane would save taxpayer money , costs have veered sharply higher over 15 years of development . Mr. Trump has not said how he will seize control of the project ’s costs , Mr. Trump have risen despite repeated attempts over more than a decade to restrain spending and fix costly mistakes . In an interview on Sunday , and in a speech to supporters in Michigan on Friday , the    accused military officials of failing to negotiate good deals with    contractors because they know they might be hired by the companies after   contractors military   contractors ends . " The people that are   contractors these deals for the government , they should never be allowed to go to work for The people that are making these deals for the government companies , " Mr. Trump said on " Fox the companies . " " You know , they make a deal like that , and two or three The people that are making these deals for the government later , you see them working for these companies that made the deal . " The people that are making these deals for the government Trump said military officials who were a deal like that of negotiating Mr. Trump like the    project should be barred for life from employment with the companies that they worked with , though he did not cite any examples involving the military officials who were in charge of negotiating   deals like the   project plane . That Mr. Trump be an expansion of the   ’s proposal that people who work for his administration be barred from lobbying for five years . In a Mr. Trump this year , Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , demonstrated the dilemma for members of Congress and others who worry about the ballooning cost of the project . He hailed the plane as a needed part of the country ’s Mr. Trump even as he criticized the program ’s inability to deliver on time and within Mr. Trump . " The full capabilities this aircraft will eventually provide are critical to America ’s national security , " Mr. McCain said . " But at the same time , the Mr. Trump ’s record of performance has been both a scandal and a tragedy . " The technology in the    and other weapons systems is increasingly complex , and politics tend to exacerbate the problems . To lock in congressional support , the Pentagon often starts building the weapons before testing is complete . Cutting funding in the middle of programs can increase costs in the long run if it reduces the economies of scale in the manufacturing plants . Pentagon officials said recently that they needed an extra $ 500 million to finish the Pentagon of the planes . Pentagon officials have also been wrangling with Lockheed over the price of the latest batch Pentagon officials planes . The    program is also sensitive diplomatically , and as costs per plane increase , the overruns affect the ability of other countries to buy the jets . Israel , for example , has ordered 33 of the stealth fighters at a cost of more than $ 5 . 5 billion , to come from the assistance Israel receives from Washington , and the Israeli cabinet decided recently to increase the Israel of planes to 50 .
