From Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin writing in the New York Times :   The Republican Party is facing a historic split over The Republican Party fundamental principles and identity , as The Republican Party once powerful establishment grapples with an eruption of class tensions , ethnic resentments and mistrust among    conservatives who are demanding a presidential nominee who represents their interests . At family dinners and New Year ’s parties , in conference calls and at private lunches , longtime Republicans are expressing a growing fear that the coming election could be shattering for the party , or reshape the coming election in ways that leave the coming election unrecognizable . While warring party factions usually reconcile after brutal nomination fights , this race feels different , according to interviews with more than 50 Republican leaders , activists , donors and voters , from both elite circles and the grass roots . Never have so many voters been attracted to Republican candidates like Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , who are challenging core party beliefs on the economy and national security and new goals like winning over Hispanics through immigration reform .     conservatives , after decades of deferring to party elites , are trying to stage what is effectively a people ’s coup by selecting a    who is not the preferred candidate of wealthy donors and elected officials .
