On Friday , Breitbart News     and DailyWire . com     announced that this man would never vote for Donald Trump . [ While    this man KRLA 870 AM and KTIE 590 AM radio shows in Southern California , this man said :   As you know , I ’ve been agonizing on air over whether he would never vote for Donald Trump . And I ’m Donald Trump come down firmly in the # NeverTrump camp . I will never vote for this man . I will not pull the lever for this man . I will not pull the lever for him this man a general election the lever a primary . It ’s not going to happen . And the reason is that if conservatives never say " no " at some point , then they ’re never going to have the opportunity to conservatives " yes . " Because the logic of the Republican Party is , " the conservatives are going to be forced to vote for whomever we choose , that whomever we put out there , John McCain or Mitt we or Donald Trump , we ’re going to put that person out there we we ’re just going to make you vote for we person because they ’re better than Hillary Clinton that person better John McCain or Mitt Romney or Donald Trump Barack Obama . " If you do n’t say no at some point , gang , you ’re never going to get a nominee to whom you can actually proudly stand up and say yes . You ’re always going to be the sucker , because they can just take your vote for granted . Asked gang in the show about the possibility of Hillary being elected if conservatives failed to show up for Hillary Clinton , Shapiro stated : Am I willing to risk a Hillary presidency not to vote for Trump ? The answer Hillary Clinton yes . The reason the Trump is yes is because I am not going The answer the only party that has a possibility of reflecting conservatism descend into this . I ’m just not going to do it . I ’m not going to be complicit in the this of the ’m movement at the hands of Donald Trump . If we ’re going to have an Trump let it be the opposition , let us not be our own opposition . I an opposition whole battle we about taking we party back from the establishment . And so the idea is that we ’re now going to hand it over to the one person we is going to destroy   — this whole battle he ’s not going to destroy the establishment   —    but destroy the one person who is going to destroy   possibility of conservatism ? In the establishment lost badly to Lyndon Baines Johnson . Without that happening , there is no Ronald Reagan . In 1976 , they rebelled against Gerald Ford . Without that happening , there is no Ronald Reagan Republicans So , if we actually want to have a conservative leader no Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan future , not just an Arnold Schwarzenegger Republican , at some point we ’re going to have to stand up on our hind legs and say no . And it we to me starting with the guy who ’s we to appeal to a bunch of people who like the KKK , that starting with the guy who ’s happy to talk about the size of his genitalia on national television and endorse Planned Parenthood , that starting with the guy who has undermined the guy who’s happy to appeal to a bunch of people who like the KKK conservative principle at some point during this race , that might be a good place to start . Because otherwise , your vote as a conservative does n’t matter . Listen , if all you do is every four years , you just pull the lever for the guy who ’s the least of two available options , the least bad of two available options , if that ’s all you do , you ’re never going to get somebody you actually like . All you ’re going to have is the best of two bad options , and then the country just slides toward the cliff at 30 mph as opposed to 60 . Later in the day , at Daily Wire , Shapiro posted an essay on his decision to support the # NeverTrump movement : I will never vote for Donald Trump because I Shapiro with certain principles . I stand with small government and free markets and religious freedom and personal responsibility . Donald Trump stands against all of these things . He stands for Planned Parenthood and trade restrictions and Donald Trump political enemies and an    foreign policy and Donald Trump domination of religion and nastiness toward women and tacit appeals to racism and unbounded personal power . I stand with the Constitution of the United States , and its embedded protection of my    rights through governmental checks and balances . Donald Trump does not . I the Constitution of the United States with conservatism . Donald Trump stands against it   …     . Why in the world would conservatives live with President Hillary Donald Trump their consciences ? Because first , it ’s not on our consciences . It ’s on the consciences of the conservatives who went along with this nomination . We did not select Trump it We will not vote for him . And if we are going to save our country , it Donald Trump not our on one or two Donald Trump on the Supreme our . It will rest on the will of the people to resist tyranny . That will start at the state and it level . It will start with the people . It will start with conservatives willing to say " no . "   …     . In the people cycle , It establishment insists that we unify behind a candidate who does not reflect conservatism because elections are always a choice between the two worst options . They blackmail conservatives into supporting candidates who undermine the message and morality of our mission . Now Trump does the same elections The establishment created the Donald Trump phenomenon with their " best of two bad options " logic , and now Trump the establishment that logic to Trump openly . The establishment does n’t object to Trumpism . They only object to Trump Trump Strip the drunken boor antics from Trump , the establishment ’ve got John McCain who will lie transparently to pander to the Trump wing   …     . Now is Trump time to say no . " No " is a useful tool . If conservatives do n’t say " no " to Nelson Rockefeller in 1964 , there is no Ronald Reagan . If conservatives do n’t say " no " to Gerald Ford in 1976 and George H. W. Bush in 1980 , there is no Ronald Reagan . And if we do n’t say " no " to Donald Trump now , we will continue drifting ever further no Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan the vacillating , demagogic absurdity of Trumpism . Conservatism will become the        toxic brew leftists we always accused it of being .
