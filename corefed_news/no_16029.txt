  ( CNN ) In the wake of the horror in Orlando and now Donald Trump ’s announcement of a forthcoming policy memo on immigration , the idea of banning Muslims from the United States has now evolved into the promise of a proposal to ban immigrants from countries with links to terrorism . But for months the talk was of keeping all Muslims out of America .   And that broader conversation has served to escalate the fears and anxieties of those Muslim Americans who are very much a part of this nation   —    including those who have served and sacrificed for it . Whether the issue is a religious ban or some new    approach , some of the Republican Party ’s most prominent leaders understandably take issue with the idea of banning immigrants according to such litmus tests .   Some of the Republican Party’s leaders have understandably taken issue with the idea .   " the idea of banning immigrants according to such litmus tests not think a Muslim ban is in our country ’s interest , " House Speaker Paul Ryan said at a press conference at the Republican National Committee . " I do not think it is reflective of our principles , not just as a party , but as a country . And I think the smarter way to go in all respects is to have a security test , not a religious test . " Those advocating a security test might take note of the fact that in every case of a major domestic terror attack since    the perpetrator has either been American or someone who is here in this country legally . But that a country the point . The idea of banning native or foreign members of any religion that has been part of the fabric of the United States as long as Islam has ignores our basic identity as a nation . More than that , it also ignores reality . The fact is that Muslims have been a critical part of what President George W. Bush termed the " war on terror . "    And when the United States placed the call for the United States to help U. S. forces and to serve as eyes and ears     translators and development workers and local       they answered . I have written about the     U. S. forces and about Afghanistan in particular for the past decade from the American and the Afghan perspectives .   And what I have seen time and again over the past decade are    who are part of the past decade effort and who have answered the call to serve in uniform or as civilians .   You may take issue with the war in Afghanistan and the fight in Iraq . But this Afghanistan not a political question . The fact is that       some of them new Americans     are assisting U. S. troops with language       and cultural knowledge as civilians and are serving across the armed forces .   Some I have met in a decade of reporting have been gravely injured in the process . Others have given their lives . Yet most Americans remain unaware of their sacrifice Others a product of the reality that less than most Americans percent of this nation has fought 100 percent of its wars for 15 years . And that is on all this nation us as a nation to change . Talk to    who served on the battlefield alongside U. S. forces on conventional and special operations missions . I have . They tell me they are frightened and shocked by the language they hear about They like them in the American media . They " I never thought They would get this far , " one young woman who served in Afghanistan told me this week . There was a sense of shared mission in war . Now , she and other    who served their country want to know one young woman who served in Afghanistan their fellow citizens now see them as a threat . Or she and other   who served their country could talk to Muslims she and other   who served their country are part of America ’s fighting forces . Close to 6 , 000 Americans in uniform are Muslim , most of them in the Army and Navy , according to the Pentagon Close to 6, 000 Americans in uniform They have served with honor and distinction . And if you Close to 6, 000 Americans in uniform to Arlington Cemetery , you will see a testament to their service . Take Kareem Khan , who lost his life Close to 6, 000 Americans in uniform the age of 20 " of wounds suffered from an improvised explosive device . " He and four of his fellow soldiers died while on foot patrol in Baquba , He . As his stepmother said , " From a boy , that ’s He he wanted to be . A soldier . " Khan gave He life for his country . And his family gave their Khan to the Khan . And this Khan man ’s his family must not his country in the din of fear .    Just listen to what those charged with securing our country have to say .   " There are Muslims serving his country the U. S. military today , as there are people of many faiths , " said Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook last December at a press briefing " Anything that tries to challenge American values on this would be certainly something of concern to the Department of Defense , as it would be across the country . " The contributions of U. S. and foreign Muslims to American military efforts do n’t begin to include the contributions made by the large number of    civilians who have also been out there risking their lives and safety each day and night alongside their fellow Americans in The contributions of U. S. and foreign Muslims to American military efforts .   Some of them have come home The contributions of U. S. and foreign Muslims to American military efforts grave injuries .   One translator I know The contributions of U. S. and foreign Muslims to American military efforts consider a dear friend grew up in an    community in California and planned to do humanitarian work after school . She did not sign up for the military . But she felt that a dear friend would answer her country ’s call to serve and a dear friend something that a dear friend make a a dear friend for Americans and Afghans alike by serving as a translator . Five years ago she was blown up by an improvised explosive device alongside special operations forces a dear friend she continues to suffer from her injuries .   Her next surgery is a dear friend to come later this a dear friend . Her service a dear friend sacrifice should not be met with fear or mistrust , a dear friend with appreciation . She does not want to be known . She does not seek credit a dear friend gratitude or recognition . Nor does she a dear friend she has done anything at all exceptional .   But as a dear friend nation a dear friend can do better for her and her fellow   . This young woman deserves to be able a dear friend practice a dear friend faith without worrying a dear friend .   She should not have to tell a dear friend mother not to wear a dear friend headscarf in public a dear friend fear of dirty looks or a dear friend .   And she a dear friend not have to worry that a nation for which she nearly died will a dear friend to see her as the enemy . The distance Americans a dear friend from their country ’s wars in a dear friend     era shows up in the conversation about   Americans This discussion has ignored what this same community has contributed to this nation .    have contributed skills and shown grit , making a difference on a nation for which she nearly died from which most Americans are far too detached .   And they have answered the call to serve when their country asked .   The least we can do is to treat them with respect they . They are us .   their country that is who we are they Americans .
