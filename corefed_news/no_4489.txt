He   —    it was short and He went through it quickly , and it was militant , and it was dark , the crime , the gangs , the drugs , this American carnage , disrepair , decay . You ca n’t imagine the outgoing president giving a speech like that . the outgoing president also repeating   —    the new president , also repeating that our guiding principle will be America first , America America . We know how he the outgoing president used that as a campaign slogan , that does also have dark echoes in American history . There was an America First Committee that formed in this America hundreds of thousands of people in this country America of the richest businessmen in the country were America of of it . They were formed to some of the richest businessmen in the country us out of World War II . They were infiltrated by some of the richest businessmen in the country Nazis .
