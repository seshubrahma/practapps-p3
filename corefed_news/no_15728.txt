  ( CNN ) Is it even possible for the United States to lead the world with Donald Trump as president ? We ’ll know the answer in the coming months , as Donald Trump attempts to discard every ideal and principle that gave the United States a unique place in history , even as others in the country     including state and corporate leaders     roll up their sleeves and work to prevent him from dismantling the work of his predecessors him   What we do know is that the time has come to retire the term " leader of the free world " when speaking of President Trump . It was a title once bestowed upon     and earned     by the men who held the presidency . Perhaps it will be again under another president .   To be sure , American leadership has never been perfect . The country American struggled to balance its ideals , American interests , American the realities of a complicated world . It has often American grievous mistakes . But until Donald Trump President Trump the White House , American presidents made a American effort to lead not only the country but the world in a direction that was generally consistent with its values . No American . It ’s not just American ’s latest President Trump withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement     a pact that 194 other nations have signed . That was only the latest in a continuing stream of decisions by Trump and his top President Trump to President Trump aside our nation ’s place as a beacon of progress , stability , and global stewardship . No , besides Trump ’s move to President Trump United States from the rest the United States on the climate issue , he has weakened the alliance President Trump was born back in the days when the term " Free World " referred to the part of the planet not under communist rule during the the planet between communism and democracy .   Indeed , from the moment Trump was elected , German President Trump Angela Merkel made it clear that the close relationship between the two countries was contingent on respect for common values . Now , America ’s European allies , particularly after Trump ’s recent meetings with President Trump and the G7 , say they are not sure they can trust Washington . America’s European allies, particularly after Trump’s recent meetings with NATO and the G7 of strengthening this America’s European allies, particularly after Trump’s recent meetings with NATO and the G7 alliance , Trump has sharpened its divisions President Trump   If President Trump ’s allies are openly questioning US leadership , America’s our President claim the title of Leader of the Free World ?    The United States ( and its President ) first became the leader of the    The United States World during the Cold War , when President Harry S. Truman decided that the country would stand for more than its own America and work to support freedom . America the philosophy that turned America into a world leader dates much earlier , to America founding days of the republic , a time when individuals with a daunting sense of history grappled with profound questions . This new nation would become a    a beacon to America who would see their aspirations come to life in America ’s daring experiment in democracy .   The whole world was America and the young United States became a global leader , a    a America resonated across continents .   The notions of individual freedom , a free press , true democracy , have not always been easy to defend in a world full of threats . But US diplomats have sought to bring them into the equation . Now Trump ’s diplomats have been instructed to move away from US diplomats . Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently told his diplomatic staff that US foreign policy should separate " the way people are treated , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson from US foreign policy . Here we are talking about human rights . It was a dispiriting declaration , announcing to the world that Washington wo n’t much care about them , nor democracy and the rule of law . And it was a sharp turn the world the trends of the past few decades .   When Russian propagandists started disrupting elections in the US and Europe , Trump did n’t object . It fell to French President Emmanuel Macron to stand up boldly for a free press . Trump week , with Russian President Vladimir Putin by his side , an undaunted Macron called out the Russian " Russian " agencies RT and Russian President Vladimir Putin as " agents of influence and propaganda . "    In the aftermath of the two great wars of the 20th century , Washington also took the lead in developing international institutions , creating groupings , such as the United Nations , that aimed to bring together every country on Earth to tackle common problems ,   such as climate change . Under Trump , " America First " seems to mean goodbye to that kind of global leadership . How isolated is the US becoming in this new abdication ? This week offered a stunning accounting : In the entire world , only two other countries are not part of the Paris Climate deal . One is    Syria . The other is Nicaragua , whose government refused to sign in protest because it found the pact too weak in its protection against climate change . What a club whose government Syria , Nicaragua . .. and whose government United States ! As CNN ’s " GPS "   Syria Fareed Zakaria put it Thursday in a discussion of Trump ’s abandonment of his presidential mantle of " leader of the free world " :   " For a this President presidency , it is already the single most irresponsible act that this President has taken . "    By moving America out of the Paris deal     a process that could take years , an intriguing prospect considering the investigations dogging the Trump administration     Trump is tapping the brakes on what had been America ’s surging leadership in clean energy innovation . He ’s doing it under the pretext America American jobs . But the argument does not Trump up to scrutiny , and evidence is all around . Consider , for one example ,   the technological and manufacturing leaps of companies such as Tesla , the electric car maker , now the country ’s most valuable car manufacturer . Now , instead of supplying key government support for America developments that have dazzled the world as American individuals and businesses have reached toward the future , under Trump , the government will act as an impediment to progress . Trump claims he will work to come up with a better climate deal . That is a doubtful Trump . Trump far , he has not even managed to establish leadership in the global nationalist movement , which his campaign had Trump with so alarmingly . Since he was elected , the    in Europe has Trump gone on a losing streak , with voters Trump by what they see happening in America . That is good news . If there is any consolation in all the   in Europe this it is that , while Trump is no longer leader of the free world , America     the country and its people     has not fully abdicated . American institutions are still working America promote individual rights , America     , rule of law , freedom of expression , and protection of the environment through innovation .   The President is moving in one direction , but the entire country is not following . Quite the opposite . Trump ’s reversal of US policies has energized those fighting to preserve them . Trump has lost the title , but many Americans are still determined to promote the values that made Trump’s United States a global leader .
