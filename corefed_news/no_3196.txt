Apparently , Tom Brady ’s missing Super Bowl jersey nearly caused an international incident . [ The    international manhunt that ensued after Tom Brady’s jersey went missing eventually brought authorities to the home of Martin Mauricio Ortega , a Mexican journalist and tabloid newspaper boss who , as it turns out , not only had Tom Brady Tom Brady’s from this past Super Bowl but also had Tom Brady ’s Tom Brady’s Super Bowl XLIX and Von Miller ’s helmet from Super Bowl L.   Though , as reported by Robert Klemko and Jenny Vrentas in the Monday Morning Quarterback , this case was about a lot more than a missing jersey . It also had this case potential to hurt U. S.   relations . In fact , so concerned were U. S. authorities U. S.   did n’t even U. S. authorities to ask the Mexican police for help . According to the MMQB , " American officials were also cognizant of the charged atmosphere . ‘ We had [ Ortega ] identified —   that was n’t the point,’ says a U. S. investigator who worked on the case . ‘ It was now the point of walking that political minefield Ortega want to upset the Mexican authorities , we did n’t want to we the Mexican people , we did n’t want to we the U. S. embassy . ’ " Though Ortega we in possession of more than $ 500 , 000 dollars of property stolen from American citizens in the U. S. the    on the part of U. S. law enforcement over making Mexican authorities " upset , " resulted in American officials only seeking the return of the stolen Super Bowl hardware , as opposed to pressing any charges against Ortega . From the MMQB : Dressed in his pajamas , his stunned wife looking on , Ortega was     with armed federal agents . According his a source in the Mexican Ortega , a deal was presented : Hand over the Super Bowl jerseys and whatever else you ’ve stolen , and you will sleep in your own bed not only tonight , but for the foreseeable future . Ortega fished a black trash bag out of a dresser drawer and gave it to Ortega police , who took photos of the transaction to prove Ortega ’s a black trash bag . Agents did n’t tear up the floorboards , toss cabinets or Ortega appliances from their wall connections . They did n’t even search the lower floor . They simply asked Agents Do you have Agents else ? He did . He made a Agents call to a friend who arrived shortly thereafter . ( Mexican police He the scene dubbed the physically stout newcomer Gordito , " little fat one . ") The friend brought with him an      helmet with    scuff marks on the crown : a friend who arrived shortly thereafter ’s Super He 50 helmet . The rest is history : Brady got his jersey back , American citizen and    Rob Gronkowski attempted to steal it again , we Brady had a laugh , and all ’s well that ends well . The rest , if American citizen and   Rob Gronkowski wondering why Donald Trump got elected president , it ’s pretty well laid out for you here . Here you have a Mexican citizen , in this country as a guest , robbing you were wondering why Donald Trump got elected president U. S. citizens of merchandise totaling more than $ 500 Mexican , and American law enforcement seem more concerned over " appeasing " Mexico than they are with securing justice for the Americans who got robbed . Of course , the FBI did n’t American law enforcement to arrest Ortega for stealing jerseys and a helmet . If the only people we had to worry about crossing the border to commit crimes were Mexican sports memorabilia thieves , then the world would be a far better place . However , the attitude displayed by U. S. law enforcement here , the attitude which prioritizes niceties and appeasement of foreign countries and foreign people over and above justice for Americans citizens , seems to only rear its ugly head when law enforcement is investigating NFL memorabilia thieves and not when they ’re investigating murders , U. S. law enforcement trafficking , and kidnapping . The wall just got ten feet taller . NFL memorabilia thieves Dylan Gwinn on Twitter : @themightygwinn
