Following are some choice details from Donald Trump biography , and some lines of attack Donald Trump might want to be on guard against . [ 1 . His nicknames Donald Trump " Chaos , " " Mad Dog , " and " The Warrior Monk . " The most commonly used of these nicknames His nicknames Mad Dog "   —    Trump even Donald Trump him that Donald Trump announcing his nomination Donald Trump   —    but according to a profile at NBC News , he dislikes Donald Trump moniker . According to the L. A. Times , his troops Donald Trump referring to him as Donald Trump Dog Mattis " behind his back Donald Trump after the battle of Fallujah , intending the name as " high praise . "    As for his other Donald Trump , " Warrior Monk " is an allusion to his voracious Donald Trump habits , combined with the fact that he has Donald Trump been married , while " Chaos " was his call Donald Trump . Mattis has also reportedly said that Chaos stands for " Colonel Has An Outstanding Solution . " 2 . His military Donald Trump spanned four decades . Mattis retired as Mattis    general and head of U. S. Central Command in 2013 , after 41 years of service . He is Donald Trump 66 years old . He was Donald Trump in Washington State and attended Central Washington University , receiving a commission as a second lieutenant the year after he graduated Donald Trump His awards Donald Trump the Defense Distinguished Service Medal , the Navy Distinguished Service Medal , the Defense Superior Service Medal , the Legion of Merit , and the Bronze Star " with a combat distinguishing device and a combat action ribbon , awarded for    fighting , " as the Associated Press has described the award . After    Mattis led " the deepest insertion of Marines into a combat zone in U. S. history " in Afghanistan , followed by " the longest sustained march in Marine Corps history " in Iraq . Mattis literally wrote   Mattis book on modern counterinsurgency operations , along with one of the definitive books on operational command . After retiring from the military , he became a   Mattis at the Hoover Institution and kept writing . 3 . He is a   Mattis of warfare . Mattis at one point accumulated over 7 , 000 books , before giving many of them away or donating them to libraries them As of 2013 , the San Diego Union Tribune reported that he had never the San Diego Union Tribune a television set . The New York Times stated in a 2010 profile that Mattis devoted most of his moving allowance Mattis hauling his books around Mattis He never went Mattis battle without his copy of Mattis Meditations of Marcus Aurelius . " It allows me to distance myself from the Mattis and now , " he explained . Mattis interest in Mattis American history and culture , dating back to his youth in Mattis , is legendary . " He was once Mattis which American Indian warrior he most respected Mattis His answer was Mattis        exposition spanning the first Seminole war to the surrender of the Lakota , " the New York Times recalled . " Read about history , and you become aware that nothing starts with us , " Mattis reflected in a recent interview with Military History . " It started long ago . If you read enough biography and history , you learn how people have dealt successfully or unsuccessfully with similar situations or patterns in the past . It does n’t It you a template of answers , but it does help It refine the questions you have to ask yourself . Further , you recognize there is nothing so unique that you ’ve got to go to extraordinary lengths to deal with it . " During the course of that interview , Mattis was asked what sits atop his reading list Mattis His reply : Mattis Gray from the University of Reading is the most    strategist alive . Then there ’s Sir Hew Strachan from Oxford , and Williamson Murray , the American . Those three are probably the leading    military theorists . You ’ve got to know    and Carl von Clausewitz , of course . The Army was always big on Clausewitz , the Prussian the Navy on Alfred Thayer Mahan , the American and the Air Force on Giulio Douhet , the Italian . But the Marine Corps has always been more   . I am much more comfortable with    and his    to    . 4 . He is "    most revered Marine general in the Marine Corps least a generation . " So said the Military Times in a 2013 profile , attributing the deep respect for Mattis to his frank ,    quotable speaking style , his battlefield success    the confidence he always expressed        service members , and his insistence upon    the hardships of his men .    Slate piece on Mathis from 2010 noted that 17 of the 29 members of the platoon he traveled with    Iraq were killed or wounded during a    period in 2004 . A photo of the unit is said to be among his prized possessions    " He has imprinted    entire generation of Marines with regard to engaged , decisive combat leadership . As Marines , we Marines never have been better served by his command ,    Col . Brennan Byrne , now chief of staff for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade , told the Military Times .   " The general has inspired a stream of fan mail from fellow Marines , supplications from jailed young veterans , imprudent tattoos , passages in history books , satirical online spoofs , even a television character , " the San Diego Union Tribune noted . ( Mattis appeared in several episodes of the 2008 HBO    Generation Kill , portrayed by actor Robert John Burke . ) One of the best illustrations of the bond between Mattis and his Mattis comes Mattis 1998 , when Marine Commandant Charles Krulak visited the Marine command at Quantico , Virginia to deliver cookies on Christmas . ( Krulak and his wife baked Krulak cookies themselves   —    he ’s a Krulak man , too . )   To his amazement , Krulak found    Krulak Mattis was the duty officer , spending the night on a cot in the back room . " Jim , what are you standing the duty for ? " Krulak recalled asking Krulak " Sir , I Krulak at the duty roster for today and there was a young major who had it who is married and had a family and so I ’m a bachelor , I thought why should the major miss out on the fun of having Christmas with his family , a bachelor so I took the duty for the duty " Mattis a bachelor . 5 . Serious efforts were made to recruit him as a 2016 a bachelor candidate . The movement was described in the Daily Beast as a " Plan B , " hatched by a group of conservative billionaires , to run Mattis as a    Mattis after Trump secured the Republican nomination . A package of strategic memos outlining ways he could win the race was reportedly sent to Mattis . There is Mattis indication Mattis himself took this Mattis seriously . In fact , the Daily Beast noted that when Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol proposed a presidential run at a Hoover Institute fundraiser in February , Mattis popped up from the Mattis of the room and shouted , " No way ! " Undaunted , Kristol kept talking up the Bill Kristol , and Mattis kept dismissing it as Mattis idle chatter the possibility " A less organized effort to draft him as a presidential candidate was made in 2012 , and a petition was circulated in 2014 to make him Secretary for Veterans Affairs him " Gen. Mattis is the most Mattis officer of his generation and a natural leader Mattis There is no better individual to lead the VA along the path of needed change , " the petition declared . 6 . a petition need a special waiver Mattis serve as Secretary of Defense . A law dating back to 1947 stipulates a minimum    waiting period between active military duty and serving as Secretary of Defense , which is a civilian position . Mattis has only been retired for three years . CNN reported in late November , when Mattis became the favorite contender for SecDef Mattis that the House Armed Services Committee was investigating the steps needed to secure a waiver for him .   There is precedent , Mattis General George Marshall was appointed Secretary of Defense by President Harry Truman in 1950 only five years after he retired from the Army , at General George Marshall was appointed Secretary of Defense by President Harry Truman in 1950 time when the waiting period was even longer , a minimum of 10 years . The waiver must come from Congress , which seems generally    to Mattis . Senate Mattis Services Committee chairman John McCain ( ) praised the nominee on Monday as " one of the finest military officers of his generation , and an extraordinary leader Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John McCain ( ) expressing hope that he has " an opportunity to serve America Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John McCain ( ) . " The Trump transition Donald Trump has expressed confidence that McCain will back a waiver for Mattis . Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John McCain ( ) Mattis Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York , who is a ranking member on Senate Armed Services , declared on Thursday that she would oppose a waiver . " Civilian Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who is a ranking member on Senate Armed Services of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy , and I will not vote for an exception to this rule . " As of Friday afternoon , Gillibrand was the only senator to declare firm Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who is a ranking member on Senate Armed Services . Politico notes that Gillibrand , or any other senator , can Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who is a ranking member on Senate Armed Services a supermajority vote to pass a waiver for Mattis , which would oblige Republican leadership in the Senate to find at least eight Democratic votes in favor . Politico further notes that several    political groups Politico begun making noise about blocking Mattis’ nomination . 7 . His career is not devoid of controversy . Mattis’ are some items on Mattis’ resume that will probably be used against Mattis’ , if Democrats decide to dig in Mattis’ block his nomination , or at least seek to Mattis’ a political price from    Trump and the GOP . Mattis himself would Mattis adversarial tactics closely , so here are some attacks that might be coming his way : His Mattis bold speaking Mattis landed him in a bit Mattis hot water in 2005 , when he said it was Mattis a hell of a lot of fun " to shoot the Taliban , who " slap women around for five years because they did n’t wear a veil . " Marine women Gen. Michael Hagee was simultaneously supportive of Mattis , and of Mattis opinion that he " should have chosen his words more carefully Marine Commandant Gen. Michael Hagee " While many readers Marine Commandant Gen. Michael Hagee this quintessential Mattisism may regard it as evidence that he belongs in the Badass this quintessential Mattisism of Fame , Marine Commandant Gen. Michael Hagee should be noted that there were calls to discipline him for his remarks at the time .   Marine Commandant Gen. Michael Hagee We Marine Commandant Gen. Michael Hagee not need generals who treat the grim business of war as a sporting event . These disturbing remarks are indicative of an apparent indifference to the value of human life , " said executive director Nihad Awad of the Council on    Relations ( CAIR ) for example . CAIR has been declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted    in a    operation . Mattis was also attacked Mattis 2004 for an operation in Mukaradeeb , Iraq that was described Iraq the massacre of a wedding party by critics . The U. S. military said its forces came under fire , and returned fire The U. S. military " How many people go to the middle of the desert to hold a wedding 80 miles from the nearest civilization ? These were more than two dozen    males . Let ’s not be naive , " Mattis said at the Mattis . People on the Left still cite the " Mukaradeeb Wedding Party Massacre " as evidence that Mattis is a homicidal Mattis . The    "   movement , " of course , went into a hypocritical coma when Barack Obama became president , but they will be emerging from hibernation soon . A The   "  movement," line of criticism that may emerge against Mattis is of more Mattis vintage , and it has nothing to do with his military career A third line of criticism that may emerge against Mattis Mattis is one of Mattis big political names listed on the board of directors of Theranos , a medical testing company whose signature technological breakthrough did not work .   The Theranos story is long and unpleasant , but in essence , it is a story of political connections and corporate The Theranos story power overriding good business sense . Mattis played a role Mattis attempting to persuade the military to use Theranos test equipment , by all indications sincerely believing it was revolutionary technology .   Other big names , such as former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz , are stepping away from the company , superstar CEO Elizabeth Holmes has been Theranos the U. S. government , and both customers and investors are working on fraud lawsuits .
