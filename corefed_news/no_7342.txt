Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump issued a statement Sunday commemorating the 53rd anniversary of Rev. Martin Luther King ’s historic    march on Washington . [ " Today we honor the enduring legacy of the great Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the legacy of all who marched for freedom , justice and opportunity , " Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said . " Their courage , heroism and sacrifice in the face of oppression is an inspiration to us all . Now , today ’s leaders must work to ensure that all of our people can live in safety , prosperity , equality and peace . "   Democratic presidential nominee and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also commented on the anniversary of the march by comparing it with Hillary Clinton candidacy more than fifty years later and insinuating that if Hillary Clinton fails to get elected their work more than fifty years ago may have been for naught . " That ’s just one reason the stakes of this election are unlike any we have faced before , " Clinton said , according to The Hill ’s report . " Those brave men and women who marched , and sat , and bled for civil rights in America must not have done so in vain . " The March on Washington is largely credited with driving the passage of historic civil rights legislation that banned discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex , or national origin .
