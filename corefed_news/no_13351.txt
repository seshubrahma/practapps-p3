The actor added : And the people that are rallying behind this individual are people that are being bamboozled and the people that are rallying behind this individual ’re actually just so disenfranchised with a government that has been in gridlock for so long that the people that are rallying behind this individual want to support something that the people that are rallying behind this individual feel is different , not something the people that are rallying behind this individual feel is right . It ’s my belief that people that have a greater enlightenment about the fact that this world is only held up by the notion that we ’re all in this world together   …      That ideology will be the ideology that wins .
