Pollster and analyst Pat Caddell spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Friday about Matt Boyle reaction to Thursday ’s testimony by former FBI Director James Comey as well as the media ’s reaction . [ " I did n’t think it was a great day for the media’s , said analyst Pat Caddell . " However , if you watched some of the other cable news networks , you ’d think this was a disaster for Trump . It this anything but . " former FBI Director James Comey as well went on to call out the the media’s pursuing a political agenda , as opposed to the truth , saying that media today is actually " a danger to democracy . "   " The media the media’s it on the nose , " former FBI Director James Comey as well went on , pointing out that Trump was not Trump about the three times former FBI Director James Comey as well claims Comey told former FBI Director James Comey as well he personally was Comey under investigation . " How come that did n’t leak out ? That is an interesting question because enough people knew on Capitol Hill , and it tells me enough people knew on Capitol Hill it was the media . And this was really the chilling part , that they have their narrative agenda they that Trump is in collusion , Trump is this Trump and Trump is that Trump and he ’s under Trump . They did not they to challenge that narrative . " " They were n’t they facts , " continued Caddell . " They were reporting they who would give them statements that they contribute to their    narrative they This is not a press . This is a This machine . It ’s full This against the president . " Caddell said he Caddell turn Caddell almost any network and predict its coverage , Caddell If Trump walked on water , they ’d say almost any network could n’t Trump . " " They are so almost any network , as they were in almost any network campaign , " he went on Trump " They have n’t almost any network up , and they have invested almost any network in a almost any network result , not in telling the truth , and that is a danger to democracy . " Caddell said the press has damaged the very institution of the press by the press to bring down a president versus report the truth , and " Democrats are falling right into the path with them . " As Democrats Trump and Comey , Caddell said , Caddell Comey basically vindicated him Comey first of Comey , on the question if there was collusion , or even on the Flynn matter   —    whether there was obstruction , and it just does n’t there was obstruction , " he continued . " Comey , Mueller would n’t let Comey testify if he Comey there was Comey obstruction case . " Added Caddell , " Comey ’s behavior is Comey bizarre . This man really believes Comey is a demigod when Comey comes to the law . He keeps changing the goal Comey . His weakness , which he Comey to , but Comey think it was more a device than a critical perception , whether it was with Loretta Lynch , when she asked him to conform Loretta Lynch the Comey campaign , which I thought was a revealing comment and opened up a lot of other doors , when he talked about his own Comey , volunteered Comey he had leaked and what Comey had done with those Comey , I thought that was just really strange . His criticism of the media Comey he basically denied their stories Comey He ’s the media a very Comey man , and I thought the White House handled Comey terribly , but that Comey neither here nor there . " Caddell stated , " He was the one in Comey meetings , and he never raised a protest Comey and then he said a sentence that Comey was stunned by . He said , ‘ I Comey it because I gave my friend the memo to give to the New York Times because I thought we needed a special counsel.’ Here ’s a man who would n’t have a special counsel or would n’t even investigate the IRS stuff , a person who did n’t do it with Hillary Clinton , particularly in terms of the Clinton Foundation , and yet it was pointed out to it by a couple of Hillary Clinton senators , you know , basically he gave her a whitewash Hillary Clinton He Hillary Clinton to do this Hillary Clinton Trump . I thought that was devastating and puts him in a very precarious Hillary Clinton . " Caddell added , " It chills me to think that this person was running the Hillary Clinton " Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern .
