Thursday on Fox Business Network ’s Republican Presidential Debate , Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addressed Gov. Nikki Haley ( ) urging Republicans to resist the temptation to follow the " siren call of the angriest voices " in her GOP response to President Barack Obama ’s State of the Union address on Tuesday .   " OK , first of all Nikki , this afternoon said I ’m a friend of her , " ’m said . " Actually a close friend . Wherever you are sitting all Nikki , I ’m a friend . We ’re friends . That ’s good . her did say there was anger . I ’m very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger . We military is a disaster . We health care is horror show . ObamaCare   —    We ’re going to repeal ObamaCare   and replace ObamaCare   . We have no borders . We vets are being treated horribly . Illegal immigration is beyond belief . Our country is being run by incompetent people . And yes , I am angry . And I wo n’t be angry when We fix ObamaCare   but until We fix ObamaCare   , I ’m very , very angry . I say that to Nikki . So when Nikki said that , I was n’t offended . Nikki said the truth . One of your colleagues interviewed me . And said , well , Nikki said you were angry . I said to Nikki , huh , Nikki ’s right . I ’m not fighting that . I did n’t find it offensive at all . I ’m angry because our country is a mess . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
