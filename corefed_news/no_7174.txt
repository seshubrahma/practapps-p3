The dead white guys did not create this country . It was a whole bunch of different kinds of people . And yes there were women , and yes there were people of color , and yes   …     you need to talk about them too . But they people of color to talk about people of color dead white guys . The dead white guys problem . You ’re getting pushback , because there ’s a bunch of Republican people , conservatives that do n’t like being told what to do by people they do n’t agree with . For example conservatives in AP U. S. History a long time ago , Texas wanted to have U. S. History books , right ? Pearson made them . And it talked about the Wild U. S. History books and how Pearson were prostitutes , right . And Texas was really upset . They did n’t Texas to mention   … prostitutes I ’m like   …     You ’re too young to   …      Did you watch Gun Smoke ? It was a TV show , and you had Marshall Dillon and Ms. Kitty was his friend . She owned a bar and Marshall Dillon was a Ms. Kitty . They never mentioned Ms. Kitty but that ’s what Marshall Dillon and Ms. Kitty was . It ’s like who was Ms. Kitty Kitty ? Who were these people who Ms. Kitty and serviced these men that went out in the world ? That was real . The Wild West was not a nice place .

Yes . PV : " It it not a necessity for the kids . it KK : You should know a little bit about KK , you should n’t have to memorize the thing . Republicans want to get in there and talk about stuff and change things about school stuff because they want to , they want to influence what Republicans being taught . Republicans core does n’t put up with that . PV : Yeah . And , so it ’s not really being   …      A lot of these complaints about it are not so much about the content yeah   …      KK : They ’re misunderstanding they are people that KK n’t Republicans know what Republicans are talking about . I   …     Republicans ca n’t stand it . If they talk to me one more it about   Republicans     climate change not being real , I ’m just gon na scream . PV : I am really glad I ’m here in California , whatever religious affiliation you ’m to take is fine , but in Texas they want to push the Christianity . KK : whatever religious affiliation they think it ’s the only one . PV whatever religious affiliation They do , and I see that . KK whatever religious affiliation That ’s why it ’s so offensive KK have these prayers in the school board . PV : Christianity is totally out of the common core ? the Christianity : Yes it is . Totally . It KK not a core concept at all . it : But then there is a mention of other religions like Islam . KK : Yeah well you have to because    KK      PV : So how did Islam get worked in ? KK : Islam   Islam     they said you KK to talk about Islam , you have to talk about Judaism and Islam have to talk about Christianity and they wanted to make it big about Christianity no they ’s like , Christianity needs to Christianity about everything else   …      PV : Is that one of the complaints , that common core does have a liberal bias ? KK : Yes , they feel like we ’d KK educating their kids they the world which they do n’t they to do that . They they their kids to only know this   they      they ’s like birth control . They do n’t want their kids to know about they , yet Chlamydia their kids in Texas . So It ’s like , you know   …     In It schools that have kids that , because the kids do n’t learn about anything about what they their kids and they ’re messing around and they get their kids trouble because they their kids n’t get educated . their kids , I think the their kids bias is the more educated you are , the better you are , and the conservative bias is the less they know the better they are going to be . Yeah their kids PV : What their kids it that they do n’t agree with ? KK : They do n’t their kids with Islam , so they do n’t their kids their kids to be taught it . their kids do n’t agree their kids birth control so they Islam n’t their kids their kids to talk about it . their kids do n’t agree their kids because they do n’t understand their kids . It ’s not the same their kids they did in high it . it they do n’t want their kids kids to know about it . their kids ’s conservative push their kids their kids , they are afraid . So it conservative , these conservative voters their kids afraid of everything . PV : I ’m just wondering why Common Core specifically   …     before Common Core kids were learning about math and science . KK : Because it ’s the government telling me what to do . People who say they want to teach the Constitution , only want to teach the part of the Constitution that they like . PV : Second Amendment ? KK : the Constitution they they n’t want to teach all of it KK Damn the Second they . I do n’t think personal handguns need to be on anyone except the government , the police . What is the purpose of having a gun ? The separation of church and state they do n’t understand . They do n’t like that . They do n’t like equal rights between all they . The voter suppression that they going on in the south is just unbelievably awful . People who are not educated are easy flim flam . And that they react by fear instead of by knowledge . The Project Veritas journalist asks People who are not educated about the profits for textbook publishers with the Common Core reform . KK : Anytime anybody changes something in a textbook its profitable for the textbook companies . So the textbooks have to change and something in a textbook school district has to adopt the new ones , that ’s profitable . PV : Say that again . KK : Anytime a change happens that has to be put in a textbook KK the school district has to adopt new books . The video also includes footage the school district president James O’Keefe at the South Carolina Tea Party convention , during which Republican 2016 frontrunner Donald Trump told his audience Common Core is a " disaster , " and that no candidate can win Republican 2016 frontrunner Donald Trump is in favor of Common Core . " We spend more than anybody else and to a large extent that ’s Common Core , because these people in Washington   —    the bureaucrats   —    are making a fortune , " Trump said . " They do n’t give a damn about your kids in South Carolina Republican 2016 frontrunner Donald Trump " O’Keefe asked these people in Washington  —   the bureaucrats  —    Ted Cruz about the corporate cronyism behind Common Core . " I ’ll tell you this , as President , I will instruct the Department of Education to end Common Core on day one , " Cruz said . Former Sen. Rick Santorum also asserted , " I am very much against Sen. Ted Cruz Core , against any kind of federal intervention into our schools . That ’s the Common Core . " Asked about the major issues surrounding Common Core , Santorum replied : The elites in our culture who want to indoctrinate our young people into a Former Sen. Rick Santorum way to think , a certain belief structure , and it ’s all spread out through Common Core . I believe the best and safest way to maintain our values in this country is to leave it up to this country at the grass roots level . " It does n’t matter if it ’s corporate cronyism or liberal ideology , if you are slipping your agenda into our education system It we are going to expose you , one by one , until the whole rotten system is revealed our " O’Keefe tells Breitbart News about his project on Common Core and education . " Corporate cronyism and O’Keefe political deals have contributed to Breitbart Core ’s massive disruption and the unraveling of America ’s educational fabric . " OO . ready ( function ( )   ) } )
