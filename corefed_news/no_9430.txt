[ " I ca n’t understand it , " the     Interstellar and Alice Does n’t Live Here Anymore star said of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump popularity in an interview with Deadline .   " The only thing I can think   —    and this is just a hypothesis I have nothing to base it on   —    is that the fact we elected a black president has excited an underlying racism , and it it come to the surface , " the actress added . " Now they ’re saying , ‘ OK , it it our turn . The racists get a turn.’ I ca n’t imagine any other election year that there could be this ridiculous and overpowering support for that particular candidate .
