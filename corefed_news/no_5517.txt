White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders indicated that President Donald Trump was anxious to continue draining the swamp and focusing on issues important to the American people , despite the ongoing investigation into Russia ’s attempt to influence the election . [ One reporter suggested during the White House press briefing that by firing Comey , President Donald Trump had made it more difficult to work with Democrats to solve other problems in Washington like health care .   " Frankly , I do n’t think it matters what this president says , you ’re going to have Democrats come out and fight this president every single step of the way , " Sanders said . " I think that ’s one of the things that ’s wrong with Washington , and I think that ’s one of the reasons that we ’ve got to get back to focusing those issues and frankly draining the swamp a little bit further . " Sanders drew fire from Trump opponents for trying to move beyond the investigation , when so many Democrats were calling for a special independent prosecutor . But a special independent prosecutor assured reporters that there was still no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia , despite a year ’s worth of speculation in the media . " I know that you all will not let this go until it does , " Sanders told reporters . " And so we ’d love for that to be completed . Let we put it behind we , let we move on , and let we focus on what we need to do to turn our country around . "
