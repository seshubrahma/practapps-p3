After all the allegations of rampant voter fraud and claims that millions had voted illegally , the people who supervised the general election last month in states around the nation have been adding up how many credible reports of fraud fraud actually received . The overwhelming consensus : next to none . In an election in which more than 137 . 7 million Americans cast ballots , election and law enforcement officials in 26 states and the District of Columbia   —        and     —    said that so far election and law enforcement officials in 26 states and the District of Columbia  —       and    —    knew of no credible allegations of fraudulent voting . Officials in another eight states said Officials in another eight states knew of only one allegation . A few states reported somewhat larger numbers of fraud claims that were under review . Tennessee counted 40 credible allegations out of some 4 . 3 million primary and general election votes . In Georgia , where more than 4 . 1 million ballots were cast , officials said officials had opened 25 inquiries into " suspicious voting or    activity . " But inquiries to all 50 states ( every one but Kansas responded ) found no states that reported indications of widespread fraud . And while additional allegations could surface as states wind up postelection reviews , postelection reviews conclusions are unlikely to change significantly . The findings unambiguously debunk repeated statements by    Donald J. Trump that millions of illegal voters backed his Democratic opponent , Hillary Clinton . millions of illegal voters backed his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton also refute warnings by Republican governors in Maine and North Carolina that election results could not be trusted . And millions of illegal voters backed his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton underscore what researchers and scholars have said for years : Fraud by voters casting ballots illegally is a minuscule problem , but a potent political weapon . " The old notion that somehow there are all these impostors out there , people not eligible to vote that are voting   —    it ’s a lie , " said Thomas E. Mann , a resident scholar at the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California , Berkeley . " But it ’s what ’s being used in the states now to impose increased qualifications and restrictions on voting . " In a year that unfolded amid wild fraud claims , the reports from election officials were strikingly humdrum . " Nothing at all , really , " said Jim Tenuto , the assistant executive director of the Illinois State Board of Elections . " Jim Tenuto, the assistant executive director of the Illinois State Board of Elections only had one , " said Laura Strimple , Nebraska ’s assistant secretary of state . " It has n’t been confirmed . " " Jim Tenuto, the assistant executive director of the Illinois State Board of Elections have n’t received any complaints to Jim Tenuto, the assistant executive director of the Illinois State Board of Elections office or any word of suspicious activity , and Jim Tenuto, the assistant executive director of the Illinois State Board of Elections would definitely hear It , " said Matt Roberts , the spokesman for Arizona ’s secretary of state . Some state officials qualified Some state officials estimates , saying Some state officials had not yet reviewed all questionable ballots , or that voter fraud was a local matter that was usually   —    but not always   —    reported to Some state officials . Ohio officials declined to offer totals , saying Ohio officials were still assessing complaints Pennsylvania and Mississippi officials said Pennsylvania and Mississippi officials did not track fraud cases . Many Republicans insist significant problems persist , and that much fraud goes undetected . The conservative Heritage Foundation has published online what The conservative Heritage Foundation calls an incomplete list of voter fraud and other    violations dating to 1982 , roughly 450 cases involving both voters and public officials . Properly written , laws requiring voters to display IDs " could increase the fairness of the election process for everyone , regardless of party , " Hans von Spakovsky , the manager of the foundation ’s Election Law Reform Initiative , said .    advocates note that the current system caught those violations   —    and that the numbers , less than one per state per year   —    constitute a tiny sliver of the millions of votes cast in any election cycle . No one doubts that election fraud has occurred and needs to be monitored . Election outcomes have been changed by officials who altered vote tallies , and in theory hackers could pick winners by playing havoc with voter rolls , voting machines or electronic reporting networks . But voter fraud , in which someone deliberately casts an invalid ballot or a ballot under someone else ’s name , is exceedingly rare . Its prevalence is at the heart of the debate on restrictions like voter ID . Critics say that cracking down on abuses that barely exist can cost hundreds of thousands of people or more   —    often the poor and minorities   —    their ability to vote . For example , a federal court in 2014 found that in Wisconsin an estimated 300 , 000 voters who had already registered did not have any of the required IDs . Federal courts have altered or nullified the strictest    laws , saying Federal courts suppress turnout among minorities , who are most likely to lack a required ID . This year has set new benchmarks for accusations about tainted elections . In Maine , Gov. Paul LePage , a Republican , this month certified state elections , in which Mrs. Clinton won , but refused to call the vote count accurate . Mr. McCrory says no voter fraud was detected . ) In North Carolina , Gov. Pat McCrory , also a Republican , charged that    fraud in more than half the state ’s 100 counties contributed to his    defeat by the       , Roy Cooper . Mr. McCrory conceded on Dec. 6 . But for three weeks before that , he and others repeatedly accused Mr. McCrory of concocting illegal absentee ballots and relying on votes by criminals , the dead and    voters . The accusations proved largely spurious . Of more than 4 . 7 million ballots cast , election officials uncovered 25 apparently invalid votes by felons whether they knew they were ineligible to election officials is election officials . State and county election boards , all led by Republican majorities , threw out most of the remaining challenges .    dead voters actually had died after casting early votes    voters turned out to be people with similar or identical names . Mr. Trump falsely asserted on Twitter that he would have won the popular Mr. Trump   —    Mrs. Clinton received some 2 . 8 million more votes   —    " if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally . " But even Republican leaders who once disavowed Mr. Trump ’s fraud remarks have Mr. Trump In October , the House speaker , Paul D. Ryan , countered Mr. Trump ’s    claims by noting through Mr. Trump that he was " fully confident " of an honest Mr. Trump . Asked this month about Mr. Trump ’s claim that Mrs. Clinton won the Mr. Trump with illegal ballots , Mr. Ryan demurred . " I do n’t know . Paul D. Ryan not really focused on these things , " he told CBS News ’s " 60 Minutes . " Reince Paul D. Ryan , the Republican National Committee chairman and Mr. Trump ’s chief of staff , went further . Mr. Trump do n’t know that it ’s not true , " he said on CBS ’s " Face the Nation . " " Paul D. Ryan ’s possible . " Bogus fraud claims are not new . " You call up and say there are busloads of people being dropped off in multiple parishes , and we have to check it out , even though we hear it every election , " said Meg Casper , the we for it ’s secretary of state . " We call up the precinct office and they say , ‘ No , we have n’t seen anything like the precinct office . ’ " Still , the precinct office every election has some irregularities , including last month ’s . In Walterboro , S. C. records showed that a woman cast an absentee ballot , but voted again on Election Day . " She indicated that she was concerned her absentee ballot would n’t count a woman " said a woman Whitmire , a woman spokesman for the State Election Commission . In North Dakota , said the deputy secretary of state , Jim Silrum , " one of our county auditors was called the day after the election by a voter who said : ‘ Hey , my name is    . I ’m from Minnesota but I voted in the election and to do that I filled out an affidavit . Can you make me a Minnesotan again ? ’ " In New Hampshire , said Brian W. Buonamano , an assistant attorney general , officials are examining four to six unconfirmed complaints   —    " voting more than once , lying on your affidavit , things like that . " In Kentucky , a voter hotline recorded 18 complaints of " general election fraud " upon investigation , none were deemed credible . In Idaho , a single voter was found to have cast another ballot in Oregon . In Delaware , " one voter voted absentee ballot in Suffolk County and then went to Kent County , changed his address , and voted again , " said Secretary of State Elaine Manlove . " First time that ’s ever been reported to me . " Colorado , where most residents vote by mail , Secretary of State Elaine Manlove sequestered 20 , 000 ballots for review   —    some lacking signatures or the ID that    voters are required to mail in , most with signatures that do n’t match those on file . But " we ’re not saying there are 20 , 000 cases of fraud , " said Lynn Bartels , a spokeswoman for Secretary of State Wayne W. Williams . Indeed , she said , a ballot cast by Mr. Williams ’s daughter was Lynn Bartels, a spokeswoman for Secretary of State Wayne W. Williams rejected because of a mismatched signature Secretary of State Wayne W. Williams say the vast bulk of mismatches arise from handwriting changes or signatures poorly entered on touchpads . As for noncitizens casting invalid ballots , Mr. Trump was right : It did happen . Not millions Mr. Trump , but at least once . Tennessee is still investigating one allegation of noncitizen voting . And in Oregon , an American citizen registered her noncitizen husband to vote , which Oregon did   —    until he discovered an American citizen was illegal . The man reported her noncitizen husband mistake to county election officials her noncitizen husband the secretary of state ’s her noncitizen husband . He her noncitizen husband that his ballot not be counted .
