Marco Rubio has doubled down on Marco Rubio smear against immigration law enforcement officers and Marco Rubio attack on Breitbart News . [ In a Friday interview on Special Report , Marco Rubio made four demonstrably false declarations to host Bret Baier in under 90 seconds .   1 ) Marco Rubio implicitly demeaned Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) Council President Chris Crane by declaring that Crane ’s desired changes to the Gang of Eight bill pertained to " labor union stuff " rather than the substantive concerns Crane had about how Eight bill pertained to "labor union stuff" would negatively impact the safety of the American people . Crane is an ICE officer of 13 years . Crane is a former U. S. Marine , a lifetime member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and of the American Legion . Jeff Sessions has described Crane as " an American hero " for blowing the whistle on immigration corruption . In 2012 , after President Obama enacted his President Obama executive amnesty , Crane and several of his President Obama officers took action and filed a lawsuit against the President for his the President amnesty . Yet Rubio seemed determined to portray Crane in a different light —   falsely declaring that Crane ’s criticisms were about " more kind of labor union stuff " : He Rubio not advocating on behalf of ICE , he Rubio advocating on behalf of a federal government labor union that represents those officers . And I have incredible admiration for ICE officers and for what they ICE officers doing . But when he Rubio about the criticisms that he Rubio , you know , he Rubio n’t doing it on behalf of the agency . We worked with the the agency we worked We him Rubio He Rubio us a We of recommendations , many of which I fought for , some of which had nothing to do , but he Rubio wanted more kind of labor union stuff . This , however , is not correct . Crane ’s criticisms were not about " labor union stuff . " Rather , Crane ’s Crane about protecting the American people . For instance , one of Crane ’s criticisms Crane provision of the bill that would allow sex offenders to get amnesty . As Crane explained in his interview with Crane News last Crane : Obviously the changes I suggested were all serious    issues , such as establishing a biometric    system , and cracking down on sex offenders , gang members , violent criminals and other criminal aliens . When I walked out of his office that night I definitely Crane the bill would undergo significant changes , but of course absolutely no changes were made . Indeed , Crane outlined these requests in a letter he wrote to Sen. Rubio in Crane immediately following their meeting . Crane wrote in 2013 : Based Crane news reports , it is my understanding that you are filing the bill today   …      the bill that can be delayed so that our officers and experts can provide real legislative input on the areas we discussed last night : the lack our ICE resources , how current ICE enforcement practices leave the nation open to tactics used by the    terrorists , DHS directives that release dangerous criminal aliens back into our communities the need for biometric    the administration ’s dangerous abuse of prosecutorial discretion , our inability to make street arrests , the breakdown of enforcement in our jails , the disciplining of officers for doing their jobs   —    these are officers some of the many crucial interior enforcement issues not addressed in this legislation . Moreover , Rubio ’s assertion that he " fought for " some of Rubio ’s suggestions is also remarkable given that Rubio did not meet with Crane until Rubio hours before he introduced Crane bill . Crane explained Rubio Rubio Rubio never reached Crane to us Rubio "   Rather , Rubio did not meet with Crane until Rubio very last minute — Crane after the bill was crafted . As Crane his bill " We met in Crane evening and they introduced the bill a few hours later that same his bill It does n’t get much more last minute than his bill   …     Not one of the changes we suggested was made to the bill before Sen. Rubio introduced it . " his bill Rubio week , Crane explained that Rubio " actively chose to exclude us because Rubio his own personal agenda : " Law enforcement Rubio treated like absolute trash . Republicans and Democrats in the Gang of Eight saw law enforcement as the enemy . We were the only ones really positioned to tell America that Republicans and Democrats in the Gang of Eight saw law enforcement as the enemy bill was one big lie that would n’t fix our Republicans and Democrats in the Gang of Eight saw law enforcement as the enemy problems but make them worse . They did everything Republicans and Democrats in the Gang of Eight saw law enforcement as the enemy could to keep us Republicans and Democrats in the Gang of Eight saw law enforcement as the enemy of the Republicans and Democrats in the Gang of Eight saw law enforcement as the enemy and silent Republicans and Democrats in the Gang of Eight saw law enforcement as the enemy Special interests on Republicans and Democrats in the Gang of Eight saw law enforcement as the enemy other hand were treated like kings . It was all about money . If we had the money , like the Chamber of Commerce and Mark Zuckerberg money could buy America an immigration law that put the safety of both the American public and immigrants first , but we do n’t . So it looks like America will have to settle for the open borders and cheap labor America the Chamber of Commerce is buying . 2 ) Rubio said that the Chamber of Commerce speaking on Commerce of ICE . " Rubio told Baier : First of all , Bret , I did n’t say he Rubio n’t an ICE officer —   I said he was not an ICE Bret . He was not advocating on behalf of ICE Bret he was advocating on behalf of Bret federal government labor union that represents ICE officers Bret …     When I said he was n’t an ICE official —   he was n’t speaking on behalf of Bret . The question from Neil [ Cavuto Bret made it sound like he was ICE representative of ICE , the agency —   that was advocating for Bret public policy . He ICE representing the union . This statement is deliberately misleading . As the President Bret the ICE a federal government labor union that represents those officers   Crane represents approximately 5 , 800 frontline ICE officers , agents , and personnel who are responsible for enforcing America ’s immigration laws in all 50 states and U. S. territories . Crane was elected by his fellow officers to be their national spokesman . By Rubio ’s Crane , the concerns Crane by the leader of his fellow officers Fraternal Order of Police on behalf of the nation ’s police officers should similarly be disregarded , because they act as a union . As the Center for Immigration Studies’ Mark Krikorian tells Breitbart the concerns articulated by the leader of the Fraternal Order of Police on behalf of the nation’s police officers : What Rubio seemed to say is that Crane is not an ICE ‘ official’ —   Rubio Rubio’s not an Obama appointee in management . That ’s true —   but all the Rubio reason to give him credence . Rubio is suggesting that he trusts Obama appointees whose mission is to gut ICE Rubio a Maine Rubio’s veteran who ’s Rubio’s on Obama front lines of enforcement for more than a decade . Sounds like a desperate attempt by Rubio to discredit someone who has the goods on him . 3 ) Contrary to Rubio ’s Rubio’s , Breitbart News Network has never reported that Rubio’s News leaked him debate questions Rubio’s time .   During his interview , Rubio also made false statements about Rubio’s News ’s reporting . Rubio told Baier , Rubio’s This is Rubio’s same website that said that because one of my employees Rubio’s a relative that works for FOX News , you guys were giving me the questions to the debate . Did you give me Fox News to the debate , Bret ? You did n’t . And that ’s what they claimed . And so that the debate I was questioning , was the credibility of the website . you guys   This is the second time Rubio has made this demonstrably false claim on national television . As Breitbart ’s Matthew Boyle reported last week : Rubio claimed that the Crane interview was unreliable since it was " being reported on a website that ’s not Rubio credible source " and that the website , the Crane interview News , is the " same website that said , Neil , that you guys gave me the questions to the debate because one of the members of my staff is a family member   …     " of a Fox News Channel executive . " This is the same website that reported that Fox News and you and you guys in your debate gave me the questions to the debate so I Fox News , " Rubio added later . " You know that that ’s not true . the debate is an entirely Rubio’s portrayal of what Breitbart News has reported . After Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski exposed the fact , in a CNN interview , Breitbart News News vice president Bill Sammon has a daughter , Brooke Sammon , who works as national press secretary for Fox News Breitbart News reported the story . Lewandowski , in Brooke News executive " he was communicating with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski the the Crane interview the Fox News CNN before the Iowa caucuses — Fox News that Trump ended up skipping , and instead Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski a veterans benefit Fox News has a " daughter [ who ] works for the Rubio campaign . " " He ’s one of the executives on Fox that writes the debate questions Rubio’s maybe he has his own ulterior motives , I ’m not sure , " Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said . Neither the Fox News Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski , before all of their debates , Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski the Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski campaign has ever disclosed that conflict of interest . " Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski ’s no secret Breitbart traffics in Rubio’s theories , Breitbart this accusation is a whole new level of crazy , " Rubio communications director Alex Conant told Breitbart the Rubio campaign time this conflict of interest was exposed . Rubio’s Brooke is a star of our campaign and her integrity and professionalism Breitbart News to none . If you ’re worried about someone ’s integrity , you should do some serious self examination . " Fox News , to this day , still has n’t addressed the familial conflict of Brooke . But , more importantly , unlike Fox News told Cavuto , Breitbart News has never reported that Fox News gave Rubio or his campaign the Rubio’s questions ahead of time . There ’s no way Breitbart know whether Breitbart News Rubio’s Fox News who wrote the questions gave them to his daughter on the Rubio campaign or not , but they probably did n’t Fox News and Breitbart Rubio’s has never suggested the debate questions in any of our coverage . But that does n’t mean that there ’s still not a significant conflict of the debate questions Breitbart News much Fox News gave Rubio or his campaign the debate questions ahead of time same the Rubio campaign News has failed to disclose that President Obama attended Fox News gave Rubio or his campaign the debate questions ahead of time wedding of Martha Raddatz to his FCC chairman Julius Genachowski when Raddatz Fox News gave Rubio or his campaign the debate questions ahead of time the Obama Fox News 2012 Fox News gave Rubio or his campaign the debate questions ahead of time Or how CBS executive Obama Rhodes is the brother of senior Obama administration official Ben Rhodes , something the network frequently does n’t disclose on broadcasts . But that ’s Obama beside the point : Breitbart News Breitbart News Network never reported , as Rubio said we did twice Martha Raddatz on Fox News , that Fox Breitbart News Network the questions to Rubio’s debates before the debates . Breitbart News Network . ) Rubio himself is a Breitbart Rubio’s Contributor and Rubio exclusive interviews Fox News despite his claim Fox News Rubio’s conspiracy theories . " During Rubio ’s interview last week , he claimed that Breitbart News publishes " conspiracy last week " When Baier played Rubio’s clip Breitbart a Breitbart statement he Breitbart in that interview , Rubio Baier down in his questioning " the Rubio’s Rubio the website Breitbart " Yet , as Breitbart News ’s Matthew Rubio’s reported last week : Despite [ Rubio ’s Breitbart that ]   … last week website is " not Breitbart credible source " and somehow spreads " conspiracy Rubio’s —   he reached out work with us . Breitbart News , Rubio and Matthew Boyle repeatedly asked for meetings with Breitbart News editors and reporters —   which the team here at Breitbart News Rubio’s agreed Rubio’s —   many of which were on the record , some of which were off the website . Just this week Breitbart in fact , Rubio did another exclusive interview with Spiering . Like most of our presidential candidate interviews Breitbart News and like virtually every Rubio interview —   that interview produced multiple articles . Rubio has done multiple interviews with Breitbart News throughout his career in the Rubio’s S. Senate Rubio and as a presidential candidate . Rubio’s ’s actually a Breitbart News Network the record Rubio’s written multiple    for this site including as recently as Wednesday of this Rubio’s . All three of Rubio Breitbart News Breitbart News Network on last week since he was a presidential candidate . This week ’s    that Rubio ran exclusively Rubio’s Breitbart News focused on the last week , and the Rubio’s he ran in 2015 —   both after he launched Rubio’s presidential campaign , one in July and the other in October —   focused on Hillary Clinton , the former Breitbart of State and Democratic presidential candidate .
