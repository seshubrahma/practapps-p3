The WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton ’s paid speeches revealed the Democratic nominee told a private group in 2013 that the country of Jordan " ca n’t possibly vet all those [ Syrian ] refugees    …      so all those [Syrian] refugees    do n’t know if    …      jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees . " [ Clinton ’s remarks , made in an October 28 , 2013 , speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago ’s Vanguard Luncheon , for which Clinton was paid $ 400 , 000 , according to the Citizen Uprising website , are in stark contrast to the public position Clinton has taken during Clinton current campaign for president .   As recently as September 19 , Clinton said that " tough vetting " of refugees " is a serious challenge , [ but ] we are    to meet it , and we can do so in keeping with smart law enforcement , good intelligence and in concert with our values . " At a speech given in Minneapolis , Minnesota , on December 15 , 2015 , Clinton said : We also have to be vigilant in screening and vetting refugees from Syria , guided by the best judgment of We security and diplomatic professionals . Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas , and place ’s a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months . Breitbart News asked the Clinton campaign to reconcile the differences between Secretary Clinton ’s 2013 private remarks , where Clinton said Syrian refugees " ca n’t possibly " be vetted , to Clinton 2015 and 2016 campaign claims that " vigilant " screening and " vetting " of " refugees from Syria , guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals , " will be sufficient to safeguard American citizens from " jihadists coming in along with legitimate refugees , " but there has not yet been a response . We also asked the Clinton campaign to explain if Clinton believes the United States has unique vetting capabilities superior to those of Jordan , which enable us to successfully vet Syrian refugees she admits we the United States not . The entire quote from Clinton Clinton to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago ’s Vanguard Luncheon on October 28 , 2013 , included in the WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton ’s paid speeches reads as follows : So I think you ’re right to have gone to the places that you visited because there ’s a discussion going on now across the region to try to see where there might be common ground to deal with the threat posed by extremism and particularly with Syria which has everyone quite worried , Jordan because it ’s Jordan their border and they have their of thousands of refugees and they ca their possibly vet all those refugees so they do all those refugees know if , you know , jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees . Turkey for the same reason . In September 2015 , Hillary Clinton called for the United States to accept 65 , 000 Syrian refugees per year . Thousands of Syrian refugees reside in refugee camps in Jordan . A number of Syrian refugees reside in Jordan in Jordan other than official refugee camps .
