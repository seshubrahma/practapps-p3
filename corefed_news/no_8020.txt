Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos sat down with Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report this week to discuss Donald Trump , Bernie Sanders and the growing army of cultural libertarians . [   On the topic of Bernie Sanders , Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos questioned the assumption that Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos is a " nice guy . " " People think Bernie Bernie Sanders nice . I do n’t get it   …     is he a Bernie Sanders guy ? No , he wants Bernie Sanders in America . It ’s poisonous , ugly , oppressive , political philosophy that has made people suffer everywhere that it ’s It tried . " Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos claimed that the end of social justice culture may be near : " If they break this time , they are they with the full support of politicians , the media , and academia . If people rise up and say this social justice thing , this language policing , this political correctness , safe spaces , trigger warnings , microaggressions   —    this stuff is horsesh*t   …     . If enough people smash its stranglehold enough people the public square , it will enough people recover , " Yiannopoulos claimed . " It will enough people come back like this again because it will enough people at the height of its powers enough people It will enough people in its strongest enough people form . " " Social justice can not get any stronger than it is Social justice . It ’s Social justice the peak of its powers Social justice is losing Social justice It ’s losing Social justice people want freedom . they want to people able to do , say , think , be , play , and read anything , " Yiannopoulos said .   " They have the people in themselves and in people people that they are able people make the best judgements for themselves on what people believe in people They do n’t people to be told how to speak . They do n’t people to be told which books to read . They do n’t people to be told which video games are dangerous . They do n’t people to be told any of these things . They do n’t people instructed and lectured to by politicians , they do n’t people to be badgered and hectored by feminists , and they do n’t people to be lied to by journalists . When pressed by Rubin about the role of emotion in cultural libertarianism , Yiannopoulos made clear that " cultural libertarianism is not about feeling . Cultural libertarianism is a response to feelings over facts . The defining characteristic of cultural libertarianism is the rigorous adherence to    policy making , and    beliefs . And a rigorous insistence on classical liberalism . It has very little do with feelings . It has a It to do with fun . " Yiannopoulos’ closing argument affirmed the importance of individualism and personal liberties : " What is behind all of this , the heart of all of this , is that rejection , that fundamental rejection of the idea that somebody else knows better than I do how I should live my life .
