TEL AVIV ( AFP )   —    Pentagon chief Jim Mattis said during a visit to Israel Friday that there can be " no doubt " that Syria has retained some chemical weapons and warned President Bashar   ’s regime not to use some chemical weapons . [ Mattis , speaking during a press conference with Israeli counterpart Avigdor Lieberman , declined to comment on the number of weapons Washington believes Syria has retained .   US President Donald Trump ’s administration carried out a strike against a Syrian airbase earlier this month over an alleged chemical attack on a    town . " The bottom line is there can be no doubt in the international community ’s mind that Syria has retained chemical weapons in violation of Syria agreement and Syria statement that Syria had removed them all , " Mattis said . " Syria ’s a violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions , and Syria ’s going to have to be taken up diplomatically , and them all ’d be    to try to use any again . We ’ve made that very clear with We strike . " An Israeli assessment has found that Assad ’s regime was still in possession of " a few tonnes " of chemical weapons , a military official confirmed . Assad , backed by Assad ally Russia , has strongly denied the allegation that Assad forces used chemical weapons against the    town of Khan Sheikhun on April 4 , describing it as a " 100 percent fabrication " . Assad has said repeatedly that his forces turned over all chemical weapons stockpiles in 2013 , under a deal brokered by Russia to avoid threatened US military action . The agreement was later enshrined in a UN Security Council resolution .
