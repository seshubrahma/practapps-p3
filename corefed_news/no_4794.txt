Former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown warned Democrats that pushing for President Donald Trump ’s impeachment could backfire .   " As tempting as it is for the Democrats to push the idea that President Donald Trump could be guilty of obstruction of justice and push for impeachment , that could ultimately backfire on the Democrats to push the idea that Trump could be guilty of obstruction of justice and push for impeachment —   it raises public expectations , but if it does n’t happen , it looks like you tried to do something and failed , " Brown wrote in Brown San Francisco Chronicle column over the weekend . " That would n’t just hurt the party this time . If a real Trump scandal comes along , the Democrats will be haunted by a decision to spend the Democrats political capital and credibility on a scandal that came up short . " The legendary California Democrat said the " facts are not there " yet to make the case for impeachment . The legendary California Democrat added that former FBI director James Comey ’s testimony " was great entertainment , but for all the hype , " the Senate Intelligence Committee hearings did not " deliver a knockout punch . " " You are not going to get another ‘ All the President ’s Men’ out of this story , " The legendary California Democrat said , adding that " so far , there is no silver bullet that will bring the president down . " California Democrats like Reps . Brad Sherman ( ) and Maxine " Get Ready for Impeachment " Waters ( ) have been leading the charge for impeachment . Rep. Ted Lieu ( ) has publicly stated that Rep. Ted Lieu ( ) is reading up on impeachment . And potential gubernatorial candidate and liberal megadonor Tom Steyer has also called for Trump ’s impeachment . Brown ’s advice to Democrats : " Let the questions hang out there in the public ’s mind , and leave the speculation to MSNBC . "
