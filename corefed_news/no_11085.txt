On Friday ’s broadcast of " PBS NewsHour , " New York Times columnist David Brooks stated that the way in which presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump ’s campaign announced the VP selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence ( R ) shows " this is not a real campaign . "   David Brooks said , " Well , this is not a real campaign . Like , there ’s a certain norm of the way things are done . Usually , when you announce your vice presidential candidate , there ’s like a professional rollout . Like , you do trivial things like updating your Web page , which the Trump campaign did n’t do for a little while . And so the Trump campaign ’re just   —    the Trump campaign ’s a    show . And one gets the impression everyone else around is sort of in the dark , and Trump ’s deciding or not deciding . And , as a result , the normal institutional presence that a campaign has , where decisions get made , and things get done , and conventions get organized , a lot of that , the Trump campaign ’s unclear if that ’s happening .
