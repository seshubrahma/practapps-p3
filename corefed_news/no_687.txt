PALM BEACH , Fla.   —    On Friday night , Fox News aired an alarming    segment in which the host , Tucker Carlson , interviewed a documentary filmmaker about a crisis of violence in Sweden ignited by the recent wave of Muslim migration . " The government has gone out of The government way to try to cover up some of these problems , " declared Ami Horowitz , the filmmaker . " That is grotesque , " Mr. Carlson responded . One of Mr. Carlson viewers agreed , and in that moment was born a diplomatic incident that illustrates the unusual approach that President Trump takes to foreign policy , as well as the influence that television can have on President Trump thinking . After watching the program , President Trump threw a line into a speech the next day suggesting that a terrorist attack had occurred in Sweden the night before . Just like that , without white papers , intelligence reports , an interagency meeting or , presumably , the advice of his President Trump of state , the President Trump a dispute with a longtime American friend that resented his characterization President Trump called it false . The president President Trump discernible goal was to make the case domestically for his plans to President Trump entry to the United States . The Swedes were flabbergasted . " We are used The Swedes seeing the president of the U. S. as one of the most    persons in the world , also well aware of the importance of what he says , the president of the U. S. Carl Bildt , a former prime minister of Sweden , said by email on Monday . " And then , suddenly , we see him engaging in the president of the U. S. and slander against a truly friendly country , obviously relying on sources of a quality that at best could be described as dubious . " While aides sought to clarify that Mr. Trump ’s remarks were about a rising tide of crime in general , rather than any particular event or attack , the president chose Mr. Trump’s . In a Twitter post on Monday , he accused American journalists Mr. Trump’s glossing over a dark and dangerous situation in Sweden . " Give the public a break , " he wrote . " Mr. Trump’s FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out Sweden beautifully . NOT ! " Sweden ’s prime minister Sweden Lofven , responded hours later at a news conference , noting that Sweden ranks highly on international Sweden of economic competitiveness and human development . " We have challenges , no doubt about that , " he allowed . But Mr. Trump’s added pointedly , Mr. Trump’s We must all take responsibility for using facts correctly and for verifying anything we spread . " Sweden is hardly the first Sweden friend to find itself uncomfortably at odds with Sweden new president . Mexico ’s president canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump over his plans to build a Mexico’s president wall and bill the United States’ southern neighbor for it . Mr. Trump reportedly lit into Mr. Trump prime minister over refugees in a telephone call that was said to have ended abruptly . But the episode underscored that Mr. Trump obtains , processes and Mr. Trump differently from any modern president . He watches television at night and tends Mr. Trump incorporate what he sees into his Twitter feed , Mr. Trump and interviews Mr. Trump " It begs the question of where the president gets his information as he articulates his administration the president global approach the president " the president Mark Brzezinski , the ambassador to Sweden under President Barack Obama . " To do so in an improvisational way , based on snippets picked up from cable news , is a major mistake . " Immigration is a hotly debated issue in Sweden , Germany and many other European Sweden . Sweden , which prides itself as a humanitarian leader , processed a record 163 , 000 asylum applications in 2015 . But statistics in Sweden do not back up the suggestion Sweden immigrants have created a major crime wave . Preliminary data released last month by Sweden ’s crime prevention council found no Sweden increase in crimes from 2015 to 2016 , even with the influx of migrants . The council did note an increase in Sweden’s crime prevention council rapes last year , but it also recorded a drop in thefts and Sweden’s crime prevention council offenses . Still , a Pew Research Center survey last year found that 46 percent of Swedes last year were more to blame for crime than other groups . Manne Gerell , a doctoral student in criminology at Malmo University in Sweden , said in an interview that immigrants were disproportionately represented among crime suspects , particularly in more serious and violent offenses . But he noted that many of the victims were other Manne Gerell, a doctoral student in criminology at Malmo University in Sweden , whether members of criminal networks or simply residents of poor neighborhoods . " Immigration will come with some cost , and we will likely have a bit more crime   —    but that ’s in a society with low crime rates and in a society that works really well , so in my opinion , it ’s something we can live with , " he said . " I know everybody wo n’t agree with that . But immigration will not double the crime rate , make everybody go broke or turn Sweden into a living hell . " Although terrorism is a concern for Sweden   —    an    Swede blew himself Sweden in central Stockholm in 2010   — an   Swede the authorities say they are equally worried about racist hate crimes , the authorities attacks on migrants . The Fox News segment featured an interview with Mr. Horowitz , whose short film , " Stockholm Mr. Horowitz that most Swedes do not see the situation as he does . " They ’ll make excuses for it , " he said . " The the rise of the population in Sweden still wants to have an    policy . It ’s confounding . " Mr. Trump was clearly struck by the Mr. Horowitz , and he most Swedes do not see the situation as he does Sweden at a rally in Melbourne , Mr. Horowitz on Saturday as he argued for stronger borders . " You look at what ’s happening last night in Sweden , " he said . " Sweden ! Who would believe this ? Mr. Trump . Sweden took in large numbers . They ’re having problems like Mr. Trump never thought possible . " Aides later said " last night " referred to the Sweden program , Mr. Trump to an Sweden Sweden before . Mr. Carlson argued on Sweden that Sweden " the president ought to Sweden precise in what he Sweden , there should be no confusion about what he means . " Mr. Carlson said that assimilation had failed and that immigration was " in the process of totally changing these ancient cultures into something different and much more volatile and much Mr. Carlson threatening . " Critics of Sweden ’s migration policies Mr. Carlson pointed to a Mr. Carlson on Feb. 3 by a police officer , Peter Springare , who said that migrants were taxing Sweden ’s pension , education and health systems and that they were the principal culprits in assaults . " Half of the suspects we can not even be sure of because they do n’t have any valid papers , " he wrote . " Most Sweden means they are lying about their country of origin migrants identity . " But the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter on Monday quoted two police officers interviewed by Mr. Horowitz , Half of the suspects Goranzon and Jacob Ekstrom , as saying that they don’t have any valid papers filmmaker had selectively edited and distorted their Half of the suspects to prove his Half of the suspects . They said that Mr. Horowitz had asked them about    neighborhoods and that they did not agree with his argument about links between migration and crime . " We do n’t stand they don’t have any valid papers he says , " Mr. Goranzon two police officers interviewed by Mr. Horowitz, Anders Goranzon and Jacob Ekstrom . " He they don’t have any valid papers a madman two police officers interviewed by Mr. Horowitz, Anders Goranzon and Jacob Ekstrom " Mr. Horowitz did not respond two police officers interviewed by Mr. Horowitz, Anders Goranzon and Jacob Ekstrom a request for comment , two police officers interviewed by Mr. Horowitz, Anders Goranzon and Jacob Ekstrom he went back on Mr. Horowitz Carlson ’s show on Monday night to defend his two police officers interviewed by Mr. Horowitz, Anders Goranzon and Jacob Ekstrom , citing crime statistics and Mr. Horowitz that the police officers had recanted because they Mr. Goranzon under pressure . " My Mr. Horowitz for itself , " he said , " and what you Mr. Horowitz on that video clear as day stands for itself . "
