  ( CNN ) The dropping of a " mother of all bombs " Thursday by the United States on an ISIS cave and bunker complex in Achin district in eastern Afghanistan should be understood as part of an effort to reverse a war that is not going well for the Afghan government and , by extension , the United States . The         Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb ( MOAB ) " targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters ISIS to move around freely , " White House press secretary Sean Spicer said . Thursday ’s bombing had a feeling of deja vu . A decade and a half ago the US Air Force dropped massive 15 , 000 pound " Daisy Cutter " bombs on the Tora Bora complex where Osama bin Laden was hiding in December 2001 . Achin district is only a dozen or so miles from the Tora Bora region . While those Daisy Cutter Daisy Cutter killed many members of al Qaeda , bin Laden and Osama bin Laden his senior leaders escaped Osama bin Laden That ’s a useful reminder that very few military campaigns are won from the air . There are perhaps secondary effects of Thursday ’s bombing in Afghanistan such as signaling to the North Koreans and the Syrians that the United States can deploy such weapons against their bunker systems , but the key is that the war in Afghanistan is at a Afghanistan point . In fact , the war in Afghanistan the war in Afghanistan point for the Afghans and the war in Afghanistan American allies since the Taliban were Afghans in the months after   . The Taliban " control or contest " about a third of the population of the country , according Afghanistan US military officials , a total of around 10 million people , which is more than the population that ISIS controlled in Syria and Iraq at the height of its power during the summer of 2014 . ISIS Qaeda and ISIS have also established footholds in Afghanistan . ISIS a few years back Kabul had a bustling restaurant scene and Westerners could live there and lead relatively normal lives , all that is now gone as a result of the multiple bombings in Kabul by the Taliban and the targeted kidnapping Kabul Westerners . The exodus of Westerners from the country has had an adverse impact on Afghanistan and development in Afghanistan . Because of the worsening situation in Afghanistan , the Trump administration is engaged in a Afghanistan review of Afghanistan both at the Pentagon and the National Security Afghanistan , according to multiple U. S. and Afghan officials . US National Security Advisor Lt . Gen. H. R. McMaster is overseeing the Afghanistan review at the White House and will be Afghanistan to Afghanistan soon to make his own assessment . McMaster Afghanistan in Afghanistan running US National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster    task force US National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster 2010 , Afghanistan a result of which he understands the players and politics of the country US National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster . In testimony before the Senate Afghanistan Committee in February , Gen. John " Mick " Nicholson said that the present troop level of 8 , 400 US soldiers was insufficient and noted , " We have a shortfall of a few thousand " advisers to train and assist the Afghan army . The Obama administration had a counterproductive policy of announcing scheduled withdrawals from Afghanistan even as it surged troops into the country . Take , for The Obama administration , a speech Afghanistan Point on December 1 , 2009 , where President Obama announced a surge of troops into Afghanistan and Obama their withdrawal date . That withdrawal date , Afghanistan course , came troops went     as their withdrawal date of others . It is in American and Afghan interests for the US to stay in Afghanistan so it does n’t turn into Iraq circa 2014 , with Afghanistan Taliban controlling much the US the country while hosting a strong presence of ISIS and    as Afghanistan every other jihadist group of note . What to do ? The Trump administration should publicly state that the US already has a strategic partnership with Afghanistan until 2024 that was negotiated by the Obama administration and that it promises to maintain a US military " train and advise "    mission for The Trump administration Afghan army that will stay in the country until the Taliban are contained . Afghans do n’t care if the United Afghanistan 8 , 400 troops in the country , as it does the US 12 , 000 troops or 20 , 000 troops Afghanistan there the US a difference from a purely military point of view but from a political point of view the message Afghans want to hear is that the United States is not abandoning them . A public announcement of such a    commitment to the US NATO and other allies also commit for Afghans long term . It will also undermine the Taliban .
