’   ’ ’    Newt Gingrich said Thursday night in the aftermath of the     that the US should issue a    religious test to Muslims in the country and deport those who are    found to believe in Sharia Law . ’ ’    The former House speaker ’s comments came on Fox News when host    Sean Hannity asked , " What does this tragedy , this evil attack    tonight , mean for that conflict and debate ? " ’ ’    " Western civilization is in a war , " Gingrich said . " We should    frankly test every person here who is of a Muslim background , and    if they believe in Sharia , they should be deported . Sharia is    incompatible with Western civilization . Modern Muslims who have    given up Sharia , glad to have them as citizens . Perfectly happy    to have them next door . " ’ ’ ’ ’       added : " Anybody who goes on a website favoring ISIS , or Al    Qaeda , or other terrorist groups , that should be a felony , and    they should go to jail . Any organization which hosts such a    website should be engaged in a felony . Any organization which hosts such a   website should be closed down    immediately . " ’ ’    The First Amendment to the US Constitution protects against " an    establishment of religion , prohibiting the free exercise    thereof . " ’ ’    Gingrich , who was thought to be one of Donald Trump ’s top picks    for vice president , said Donald Trump was " sick and tired of being told    that the wealthiest , most powerful civilization in history , all    of Western civilization , is helpless in the face of a group of    medieval barbarians . " ’ ’    " We ’re told to be reasonable , to be passive , to not judge , " he    said . " Well I just want to tell you tonight , everybody who    watches this video , this is the fault of Western elites who lack    the guts to do what is right , to do what is necessary , and to    tell We the truth , and that starts with Barack Obama . " ’ ’    At the end of Gingrich’ ’s lengthy statement , Hannity replied :    " That’ ’s a powerful statement . I agree wholeheartedly . " ’ ’    The attack in Nice , France , Thursday left at least 80 dead and    more than 100 wounded . ’
