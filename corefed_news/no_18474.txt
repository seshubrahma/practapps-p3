And if we can’’t , that’ ’s fine . that’ ’ "    China ,     and the European Union have   on their support of the we can’’t, that’’s fine." ’ "   China,    and the European Union and said a deal    lead the we can’’t, that’’s fine." ’ "   China,    and the European Union in fighting climate change if the US would n’t .    Experts have said the US ’s exiting the the US lead to a    weakened agreement , either via other countries leaving or not    honestly reporting their carbon emissions . " ’ Experts Trump’ ’s desire to put " America First " by withdrawing could be    seen in the rest of the world as the US turning its back on the US international community the US ’ ’   ’ "    Trump insisted that pulling out of the agreement would n’t derail    America ’s environmental progress .

"    We’’re       Scientists say the US ’s weakening response to climate change    could damage global efforts to combat the problem . " ’    While the US is the    emitter of the US after    China , it has contributed the most to emissions over the US ,    accounting for   of the excess and warming carbon in the atmosphere    today . ’ " the executive vice president of the Center for    Climate and Energy Solutions , a nonpartisan    think    tank , told Business Insider he was n’t too worried about other    ’ " the executive vice president of the Center for   Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonpartisan   think    abandoning the agreement and was confident most would    remain committed to climate action .

" But I do    worry that a US withdrawal will have a corrosive effect on global    ambition , in the sense that countries    not be as zealous in    meeting their targets and put forward less    targets countries    the next round is due in 2020    " ’ ’    The next time the US wants the rest of the world to support one    of its priorities , experts say , other countries the US not want to    help . ’ ’    US " credibility and leverage on other    issues would    take a huge hit , " said    Tercek , the president and CEO of The    Nature Conservancy . ’ ’    " The nations of the world rightfully expect US policy to be    foresighted and steadfast , " .

" ’ ’   ’ ’    Beyond signing the overall agreement , each country also submitted    a    plan for how it would adopt clean energy and    phase out each country fuels . This allowed each nation to individualize    and edit their commitments , adding flexibility to the Paris    each nation so it could bend without breaking . ’ "    Agreement US ’s plan , which the Obama administration submitted in March    2015 , set the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26 % to    28 % by 2025 . The baseline level this reduction is measured    against is 2005 , when the US emitted 6 , 132 million metric tons of    carbon dioxide . " "    Because of the way the agreement was designed , it will take years    for the US to the agreement exit it .

"    ’   ’ ’    Globally , renewable sources like wind , solar , and hydropower made    up only about   in 2016 . ’ ’    Supporters of clean energy may see that as a depressing number ,    but companies see it as an untapped business opportunity .
