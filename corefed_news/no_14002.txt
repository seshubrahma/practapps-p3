Price is an orthopedic surgeon who was first elected to represent Georgia ’s sixth district in 2004 , after serving four terms in the Georgia State Senate . One of Obamacare ’s most vocal critics from Obamacare beginning , Price has introduced legislation to the House of Representatives proposing how he would replace President Obama ’s signature piece of legislation . Price would not just be at the helm of Republicans’ efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act . he ’d also oversee policies and budgets that affect nearly every facet of Americans’ physical and mental health .

After doctored videos of employees discussing fetal body party were published , Tom Price characterized the organization ’s practices as " barbaric . " Planned Parenthood has called Price a " grave threat to women ’s health . "   " Regardless of where they stand on abortion , most Americans agree it should not be funded by taxpayer subsidies , " Tom Price said in a 2010 statement . " Giving abortion providers ( funds ) for other activities just frees up an equal sum of money to support their abortion providers (funds) practices . " " It ’s time to end this sickening taxpayer subsidy of abortions , " he said . Currently federal money is not being used to perform abortions in the US except to save the life of the pregnant woman or in cases of rape or incest , which the federal Medicaid program currently mandates .    Planned Parenthood says it Planned Parenthood reimbursed by the federal government ( mostly through Medicaid Medicaid for specific medical procedures that do not include abortions . But some critics maintain that the money in Planned Planned Parenthood budget is " fungible " and can be reallocated . Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood about 3 % of the services it provides are Planned Parenthood . STD screening and treatment accounts for about 45 % of services provided contraception accounts for about 31 % cancer screening and Cancer accounts for 7 % and other health services , such as pregnancy tests or prenatal services , account for 13 % according to the organization ’s    annual report .

That ’s what needs to happen . " Mental health and guns , Last year , last year Georgia Price Marietta Daily Journal newspaper that the country ’s mental health system needed to get better at diagnosing and treating    individuals in order to stem violent crimes .

Price asserted that when Price has taken place , gun ownership has protected     not harmed     those at the scene of the crime . " In fact , guns are used more often to protect lives , not take lives . Steps to remove firearms from the hands of    citizens endanger those very citizens , " he said . A 2014    published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine , found that access to firearms is associated with increased risk for suicide and being the victim of homicide . There is currently no independent evidence showing that gun ownership is associated with a decreased risk of    deaths . Some experts think that the CDC has done little research on gun violence because doing so may encourage legislators aligned with the National Rifle Association to take away funding from the agency .   Stem cell research , Price has been outspoken against research that involves embryonic stem cells . In 2005 , Price spoke with Georgia Price Athens    newspaper about the " ethical dilemma " of stem cell research . Embryonic stem cells , which have the potential to treat myriad medical conditions , are controversial because they derive from early Embryonic stem cells, which have the potential to treat myriad medical conditions . The cells are of embryonic stem cells research because they have the potential to embryonic stem cells into many different cell types , and so scientists believe they can be used to embryonic stem cells cells and tissues that could be used for    therapies . " There are people who believe any form of embryonic stem cell research necessitates the destruction of human life , " Price said . " I ca n’t overestimate the importance of that statement . " And for people who believe that , " stem cell scientists are threatening your fundamental principles , " he said . According to the National Institutes of Health ’s current guidelines on human stem cell research , embryonic stem cells are eligible for research with NIH funding if they were created using in embryonic stem cells fertilization and are no longer needed or were donated by individuals seeking reproductive treatment . Price has voted against expanding embryonic stem cell research . As HHS secretary he would oversee NIH grants HHS secretary research on NIH stem cells .
