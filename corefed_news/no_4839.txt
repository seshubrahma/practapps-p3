On Friday ’s " Real Time with Bill Maher " on HBO , host and comedian Bill Maher interviewed Breitbart News     Alex Marlow .   The two discussed Breitbart Breitbart coverage , the media , Russia , free speech , the shooting at a congressional baseball practice , and political rhetoric . Marlow Alex Marlow that Breitbart Breitbart " not going to cover the exact same stories the exact same way as all the other outlets . We ’ll leave that to the rest of the establishment press . We We very much    trying to highlight stories that we We n’t think get their    day . " After the discussion turned to Russia , Marlow Alex Marlow that there was no evidence of collusion or obstruction of justice , adding , " You guys continue to talk about this story in the the establishment press of talking about the president ’s agenda , which is by design . Because you guys wo You guys if it turns out there ’s nothing , no one will come out on MSNBC , they ’ll just move no one to the next hysteria , and that ’s a huge advantage for people like me who are covering Breitbart rest of the news . " Marlow later said , " I love highlighting Muslim voices who are progressive and reformist and want to take out some of the misogyny and some of the hatred associated with radical elements of it . And I think that ’s an important place to start , but to bring back what Breitbart does different than anyone else , is we cover stories the establishment press does n’t want to cover . " On free speech , Maher and Marlow agreed that if Marlow depictions of the assassination of President Trump were of President Obama , the reaction on the left would be different . Maher then raised corporations Maher ads from people who engage in speech they do not like . Marlow said , " Marlow really started —   in my view —   in the modern era , with Breitbart —   where a lot of people are boycotting Breitbart . And what Breitbart ’re doing is , there ’s a lot of anonymous people online , cowardly people . We do n’t know who ’s funding them . We do they know We they are , who they putting out all of this misinformation about who we are and what We stand for , We they ’re trying to they up corporations to boycott us . And so We what ’s happened is that corporations are now deciding what ’s free and fair speech , who can make a living , what opinions you can make a living saying now , and , of course , now , you ’re seeing the right fight fire with fire and want boycotts of when the left takes it too far in their Trump hatred . corporations it ’s a very it path we ’re on , and I really do think , Bill , and I appreciate you giving me this opportunity , people on the left and the the left are free speech advocates need to come together right now and say that corporations are not going to define the First Amendment and free speech in this country . " Marlow said that he does not believe Bernie Marlow is at fault for the congressional baseball practice shooting and continued , " When you have a climate where you have , CNN , for example , calling Breitbart to the number one platform for the Nazi salute over a video we never played and CNN played , when you CNN the New York Times accusing Breitbart of putting racist dog Breitbart out , when the media lies so much about people , calling Trump supporters racists , despicable , deplorable , all of these things over and over   …     " Maher cut in , " They have been racist , despicable , and deplorable . " Marlow concluded , " I encourage everyone to go to breitbart . . You can Breitbart some of the Breitbart reporters , the Breitbart Breitbart . They ’re Breitbart most wonderful some of the Breitbart reporters, the Breitbart editors diverse , influential journalists on the planet , and no one is interested in their real story because they some of the Breitbart reporters, the Breitbart editors so quick to some of the Breitbart reporters, the Breitbart editors people racist . And it ’s not working . That is why so many Democrats are losing across the country .    …      And so , if you want to play that game , Bill , if you want to keep calling us racists , I do n’t think it ’s going to work for you , so please , racists at it .
