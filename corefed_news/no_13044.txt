.@BretBaier : Trump has passed the point of Trump past being a drag on himhttps :   .   Monday on Fox News Channel ’s " Fox   Friends , " Bret Baier , host of " Special Report , " argued that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s past is no longer a drag on presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump because presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had already passed the point where the electorate would judge presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump past .   " I think that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has passed the point of his presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump being really a drag on him presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump now he presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump this vessel of kick over the table and both parties are n’t working in Washington , " Baier said . " I think he presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump some hurdles to get over from explaining this stuff and the whole thing that he presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump the public relations guys and that it was n’t him presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that it was him presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump it ’s kind of messy . All of that as far as voters   —    I do n’t think we ’ve seen throughout this primary that that affects him presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump all .
