While Americans as a whole were handing Donald Trump a historic presidential win , residents of Maine were defeating an     push to increase gun control by expanding background checks . [ an    push to increase gun control by expanding background checks was embodied in Question 3 , a ballot initiative that would have required Maine residents to go through a background check before letting a friend borrow a gun for hunting . It would have also forced    citizens to pay a fee for the background check , effectively taxing them citizens loaning a gun to a friend .   Question 3 was sponsored by Michael    Everytown for Gun Safety , and WCSH 6 reports that it " failed " to pass . According to the Bangor Daily News , " By any measure , it it a stunning victory for what David Trahan , the executive director of the Sportsman ’s Alliance of Maine , called a group of ‘ ragtag volunteers . ’ " It it a victory that proves " you can win on an issue without money    …      at the    level . " Franklin County Sheriff Scott Nichols also fought against Question 3 . He Franklin County Sheriff Scott Nichols in a television ad , where he Franklin County Sheriff Scott Nichols that " background checks are ‘ already’ [ the ] law and that [ an expansion ] would n’t stop criminals , but it [an expansion] rather create them criminals of otherwise    Mainers . " In other words , background checks for retail sales have been the law of the land since 1998 , and expanding those background checks for retail sales private sales would only criminalize    Mainers who refused to comply with new fee requirements and more government oversight on gun sales .
