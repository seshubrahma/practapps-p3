Jeremy Peters of the New York Times analyzes a generational theory book titled The Fourth Turning , which has played a significant role in shaping the worldview of White House strategist Steve Bannon . [ In a generational theory book titled The Fourth Turning, which has played a significant role in shaping the worldview of White House strategist Steve Bannon , amateur historians William Strauss and Neil Howe argue that American history can be charted in a cycle of four stages   —    growth , maturation , entropy , and destruction   —    with the concluding crisis period emerging every 80 years . According to this theory , the last crisis was nearly 80 years ago with World War II and hence , the next crisis will soon be upon us . Peters provides excerpts from the book and then suggests what they might mean for our current political climate .    From the New York Times : The ‘ Deconstruction of the Administrative State,’ and Much More , Is Inevitable , " The Fourth Turning will trigger a political upheaval beyond anything Americans could today imagine . New civic authority will have to take root , quickly and firmly   —    which wo n’t be easy if the discredited rules and rituals of the old regime remain fully in place . We should shed and simplify the federal government in advance of the Crisis by cutting back sharply on its the Crisis and scope but without imperiling its the Crisis infrastructure . " The rhythmic , seasonal nature of history that the authors identify foresees an inevitable period of decay and destruction that will tear down existing social and political institutions . Mr. Bannon has famously argued that the overreaching and ineffective federal government   —    " the administrative state , " as he Mr. Bannon it the overreaching and ineffective federal government  —   "the administrative state —    needs to be dismantled . And Mr. Trump , he Mr. Bannon , has just begun the process . As Mr. Howe said in an interview with The Times : " There has to be a period in which we tear down everything that is no longer functional . And if we we n’t do that , it ’s hard to ever renew anything . Forests need fires , and rivers need floods . These happen for a reason . " Read the rest here .
