WASHINGTON   —      mayors and housing experts are nervous about the idea of a billionaire real estate developer in the White House . Now    Donald J. Trump has picked Ben Carson , a retired neurosurgeon with no housing experience , as   Donald J. Trump nominee for secretary of Housing and Urban Development   —    and high anxiety has set in . As The Times ’s    bureau chief , I have spent a lot of time in Baltimore , Cleveland and Philadelphia , which are all run by Democrats . In those cities , and many others across the country , housing concerns are deeply intertwined with other    issues , including racial tensions with the police . To explore how a    housing agenda might play out , I reached out to two Philadelphia mayors   —    Jim Kenney , the incumbent , and Michael Nutter , his predecessor   —    and two housing experts , one in Philadelphia and one here in Washington . Here are some of their thoughts : Broadly speaking , HUD devotes HUD to ensuring that families of    and modest means have access to safe homes and neighborhoods . HUD runs the Federal Housing Administration , which helps people get home loans . HUD distributes money through the Community Development Block Grant program , a flexible source of funding used by cities for redevelopment and for rebuilding communities after natural disasters like floods and hurricanes . HUD runs the Section 8 housing choice voucher program , which cities rely on to help house the poor . And HUD enforces the Fair Housing Act , part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 , which makes housing discrimination illegal . Even in a time of economic expansion , dealing with poverty will be the biggest challenge the next HUD secretary faces , conservative and liberal housing experts agree . The American Enterprise Institute , a conservative research organization , cited housing assistance programs as among those " ripe for reform ’’ under Mr. Trump . Since 2000 , the number of    neighborhoods in America has doubled , rising faster in the suburbs , like Ferguson , Mo. than in cities , said Ms. Liu . " There ’s a lot of anxiety now , because this election was about the heartland versus the coastal elites we ’re going to need a HUD secretary who governs both , " Ms. Liu said . " When I think about what HUD is going to have to deal with next , it ’s going to be the future of    neighborhoods , and how to deal with that not only in Baltimore but also Ferguson . " Mr. Carson grew up poor in Detroit and became a celebrated neurosurgeon by the time he was in his 30s   —    a path that he attributes to his      Mr. Carson . His Mr. Carson praise his     success story . But Mr. Carson critics say Mr. Carson career in medicine Mr. Carson not the Mr. Carson training for someone running a Mr. Carson federal housing bureaucracy . " He has a powerful personal story that could connect him to a lot of families that Mr. Carson on HUD assistance , " Ms. Liu said Mr. Carson " He just needs to use that personal story to listen and empathize   —    and Mr. Carson learn about the latest his    success story field . ’’ Most HUD secretaries have had government experience . George Romney , who served under Richard M. Nixon , was HUD governor . Jack Kemp , who served under George Bush , was a congressman . Henry Cisneros , who served under Bill Clinton , was a mayor so was Julian Castro , the current secretary . Ira Goldstein , who worked at HUD under the first President Bush and Mr. Clinton , admired Mr. Kemp . " He had a HUD of relating to people at every economic level he could walk into housing developments Mr. Kemp be perceived as an ally , " said Mr. Goldstein , Mr. Kemp now supervises research at Reinvestment Fund , a nonprofit devoted to redevelopment in Philadelphia Mr. Goldstein said , to run HUD programs " with a businesslike tenor . " Mr. Nutter , who now teaches urban affairs at Columbia University and is a commentator for CNN , says he does not know if Mr. Carson has what it takes . " As brilliant as folks have said that Dr. Carson is from a neurosurgery standpoint , creating fair housing , promoting economic development and having Mr. Nutter, who now teaches urban affairs at Columbia University and is a commentator for CNN living in prospering communities is a little different than operating on somebody ’s brain , " Mr. Nutter said Mr. Carson I do not know how that translates into being HUD secretary . ’’ Mr. Trump got rich building luxury properties most mayors are concerned with housing the poor . In the 1970s , before Mr. Trump got into the luxury business , the federal government sued his family ’s company , accusing it of routinely refusing to rent to     —    the very discrimination that HUD , through the Fair Housing Mr. Trump seeks to prevent . ( Mr. Trump ’s firm settled without Mr. Trump wrongdoing . ) Under President his family’s company , HUD expanded its civil rights reach with the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule , which says that cities must not only respond to bias , Mr. Trump steps to prevent it . Philadelphia " was proud to become the first city " HUD adopt the rule , said Mayor Kenney , whose administration has just submitted an extensive plan to put the rule into effect . Some conservatives see that rule bias federal intrusion into local sovereignty   —    the mayor of Castle Rock , Colo. population 55 , 000 , has refused to accept HUD funding to avoid having to the rule —    and Mr. Trump is likely to roll it back . Mr. Kenney , in a carefully worded statement , make clear that he would push back against any changes . " We will continue with our efforts to overcome patterns of segregation , promote fair housing choice and foster    communities , " the statement said . Mr. Goldstein , who was the    Mr. Kenney of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity when he was at HUD , We about something else : If Congress complied , Mr. Trump could use federal budget policy to deprive a carefully worded statement of funds to enforce    laws . " You ’ve got to say that , given the tenor Mr. Trump the rhetoric , that would be a part of HUD that would not be favored in the new administration , " Mr. Goldstein said . Words matter in politics and policy , and both Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson have made comments that make mayors and housing experts uneasy . Mr. Carson once told a television interviewer that he had risen above his circumstances by realizing that " poverty is really more of a choice than anything else , " by which he apparently meant that people escape poverty through hard work . Mr. Carson , spotlighted in a video    on Mr. Carson Salon website , Mr. Carson dogged the neurosurgeon . So has an opinion piece he wrote in which he described fair housing policy as Mr. Carson social engineering . " This plays into Mr. Trump ’s sweeping declarations about black people living in " inner cities " rife with crime . " I give Trump credit for talking explicitly the neurosurgeon the importance of the neurosurgeon inner city , " Ms. Liu said , " but we need to the neurosurgeon that the policies really do address what is needed there . What we do n’t need is just     tactics the neurosurgeon " Mr. Nutter , who is    is far more pointed he calls Mr. Trump ’s characterizations of cities " a general insult . " Philadelphia built hundreds of affordable housing units using flexible Community Development we Grant funds while Mr. Nutter was mayor . Most of the money , he said , was spent in Mr. Nutter, who is    communities the neurosurgeon I ’m proud that I had seven years with President Barack Obama , who actually knew about community development because he was a community organizer , " Mr. Nutter said . " To the Philadelphia city Mr. Nutter : Good luck dealing with the Trump administration . "
