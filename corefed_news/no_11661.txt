On his show on Wednesday , conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh offered his analysis of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump ’s rise , which his argued was n’t a sign that conservative orthodoxy was winning the day , but instead conservative orthodoxy is a pushback against the    Democratic Party and President Barack Obama .   And that according to Limbaugh is a sign of the rise of nationalism and populism overtaking conservatism . " What ’s happening here , nationalism , dirty word , ooh , people hate it , populism , even dirtier word , " Limbaugh said . " Nationalism and populism have overtaken conservatism in terms of appeal .   And when this has happened , when this exposes   —    what people in Washington are afraid of   —     and that that is , you know , all this money we ’ve asked people to send we and all these donations people have made , this movement , promote that movement , where is conservatism in Washington , what people in Washington ’re asking .   Where is it ?   The Republican Party is n’t conservative .   Where are all these conservative people that are contributing to policy being implemented in Congress or in the Senate ?   all these conservative people that are contributing to policy being implemented in Congress or in the Senate do n’t see it .
