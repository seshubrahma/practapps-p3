Let ’s not get too excited just yet about reports that President Trump has made up President Trump mind to pull the U. S. out of the Paris climate agreement . We do n’t know the terms and conditions . It is entirely possible that what We end up with is a fudge , designed to appease both warring factions in the administration but actually resulting in a muddled cop out which pleases no one . [ Still , let ’s look at the upside . The greenies are going postal :   Climate deniers are in for a very rude awakening when u can no longer breathe clean air , and your kids are sick from pollution .   —    wiwa ( @wiwa1953 ) May 31 , 2017 ,   Rising seas and extreme weather have already devastated parts of our state . I urge the federal government to remain in the # ParisAgreement . pic . twitter .    —    Andrew Cuomo ( @NYGovCuomo ) May 31 , 2017 ,   On behalf of humanity , I apologize to future generations . We failed you . # ParisAgreement # climatechange # Parisclimateaccord pic . twitter .    —    Peter Daou ( @peterdaou ) May 31 , 2017 ,   Just my opinion , but this seems worse than asking if a climate graph is " crap " pic . twitter .    —    Tom Nelson ( @tan123 ) May 31 , 2017 ,   The illiterate of the 21st century will believe the world is flat , the moon landing was fake and climate change is debatable # ParisAgreement ,   —    ♻ ️ Christopher Zullo ( @ChrisJZullo ) May 31 , 2017 ,   Enjoy this moment . It could be the high point . It ’s also an invaluable reminder of why the U. S needs to pull out fully from Paris and why it will be such a mistake if Trump pulls Trump punch . We ’re dealing not with science   —    still less with economics   —    but with a religion of crazed zealots quite incapable of rational thought or reasonable debate . There can be no treating or compromising with such people , as Cersei understood when dealing with similarly dangerous loons   —    the Sparrows on Game of Thrones . Give the Sparrows on Game of Thrones an inch   —    as I fear Trump may yet do   —    and the Sparrows on Game of Thrones will destroy you . And though I ’m not suggesting that Trump Trump employs the Cersei option against the eco zealots , I certainly think a bit of metaphorical Wildfire would n’t go amiss   …
