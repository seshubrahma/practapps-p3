  ( CNN )  (CNN) are the flick and the grab viewed ’round the world .    Arriving in Rome , on his way to visit the Holy Father , of all people , President Donald Trump stood at the door of Air Force One and reached for Trump’s ’s hand . She avoided President Donald Trump Trump’s , reaching up to brush her hair away Trump’s her eyes instead Trump’s President Donald Trump then appeared to put President Donald Trump hand     wait for it     on his hand     behind . Trump’s The internet caught fire with commentary about Trump ’s move , which , if it was n’t what it seemed to be , was recklessly close to a crude display of male ownership . It might have it unnoticed , or at least less noticed , had the Trumps not been the subjects of a similar episode two days earlier at Israel ’s Ben Gurion International Airport . As the couple walked away from Air Force One , the President strode Air Force One his wife ( a Air Force One of marital disconnection so familiar to us all by now that it could be a fun cue for a drinking game ) . On Sunday , though , the President seemed to Air Force One of it , and as his host , Prime Minister Air Force One Netanyahu , grasped his own spouse ’s hand Air Force One Trump reached back for Melania . She rebuffed him with a Trump of Air Force One wrist , never breaking Trump stride . To say Trump the media has reacted to these incidents would be an enormous understatement . The press ( and social media ) have gone a little nuts over them . This is partly The press (and social media) of    demand to see the first lady , who has kept out of the spotlight for months and is now making a    grand tour with her husband     but perhaps more importantly out of a fascination with the way this marriage functions ( or does n’t ) . How might she feel about being married her Donald Trump ? British newspaper The Independent invited a body language expert to offer her assessment . " Melania her President ’s Hand Away to Say She Wo n’t Be Treated her a Child , " read the news site ’s headline , telling you all you needed to know about what followed . Vanity Fair described it as a gesture " ripe for reading into . " Even Pete Souza , Barack Obama ’s official White House photographer , could n’t resist a little trolling , posting a photo of Obama and Michelle Obama comfortably Barack Obama hands at a Selma event , as a contrast . Predictably , while much of the world recognized the flick for its dismissive power , the    Gatewaypundit . com creatively dubbed it a " low five its " If you say so .    But I ’m not buying it . The flick was its rebuff the flick been preceded by innumerable acts of presidential and spousal unkindness , and the grab suggests that the President and first lady are locked in a war of signals and symbols .           On the President ’s part , the goal is always to project power and dominance . Never interested in the kind of subtlety shown when men demonstrate their strength by daring to show men soft side , Trump does not comfortably display affection and has a long record of making disparaging comments about women .   This is the man who has talked about women as a body part that responds best to being treated shabbily . He has joked about his daughter the man who has talked about women as a body part that responds best to being treated shabbily sex appeal and the man who has talked about women as a body part that responds best to being treated shabbily publicly about whether he could have had sex with the man who has talked about women as a body part that responds best to being treated shabbily Diana .   At the same time , he is generally willing to sacrifice the man who has talked about women as a body part that responds best to being treated shabbily around him     even his wife . the man who has talked about women as a body part that responds best to being treated shabbily performance at the man who has talked about women as a body part that responds best to being treated shabbily Al Smith the man who has talked about women as a body part that responds best to being treated shabbily dinner last fall , when he made Melania the butt of the man who has talked about women as a body part that responds best to being treated shabbily best jokes , is a the man who has talked about women as a body part that responds best to being treated shabbily in point . ( Trust this husband ’s word on this the man who has talked about women as a body part that responds best to being treated shabbily man should ever do this to his spouse . )   this reportedly No man Melania to promise she would get her Melania back before Trump agreed to Trump a child with Trump . And he famously walked away Trump her on Trump Day , rushing up Trump steps of the White House while she was still getting out of the Trump .    Trump ’s ungentlemanly style has inspired lots Trump " Free Melania " posts on the internet , as many people feel the urge to support her as she suffers indignities and disrespect Trump full Trump of the world . The assumption by many is that she is getting the short end of Trump bargain that she never thought would take her out Trump her glamorous life in Trump York and Trump her into the public eye . And Trump rages still over whether she is a victim or an enabler Trump the poorly behaved Trump .          The fact is , every first lady is examined closely and subjected to great amounts of " projection " as the American public tries to get a fix on who she really is . In Melania     every first lady remains    and generally out of view     we have less than we usually have to work with . we Michelle Obama was outgoing and engaged , ready to dance with Ellen DeGeneres or play carpool karaoke with James Corden , Melania often looks pained at the attention she receives .   People naturally wonder Ellen DeGeneres she reacts to Trump in the way Ellen DeGeneres would . Is she appalled by People behavior ? Was Ellen DeGeneres announcement that she was interested in Ellen DeGeneres as a Ellen DeGeneres an intentional tweak of the President ? After all the ways that he has publicly disrespected her , is his now completely over Ellen DeGeneres ? Is Ellen DeGeneres what the flick his all about ? The couple ’s every gesture and glance becomes a clue     a Rorschach test for left and right . Understanding the President is a lot easier . the President at the Rome airport seemed to be a matter of    his wife . She flicked , then he    to grab   his wife demonstrating that he    as ever , will go further    his opponent to win any contest .       as Trump ’s behavior may be , not everyone sides with Melania . No one who marries Donald Trump can be considered a naïf , and this is especially true of anyone who chose to become his third wife . But surely what this No one who marries Donald Trump lady has experienced goes beyond what one might call fairness .   Between her husband ’s awful talk captured in the this first lady Access Hollywood tape     " You can do anything "     and his lurching performance thus far as President , her husband must feel angry and disappointed . And this first lady most women who find themselves stuck with a boor , she ’s saddled with the responsibility of an this first lady job that binds her even more closely to her husband . this first lady Stuck in a tight her husband Melania must , out of respect for the American public , grin and bear it . But she has ways of resisting . the American public staying this first lady New York , keeping a very low profile when she ’s in the same house with him this first lady and rejecting his attempt to hold her hand , it ’s him to believe this first lady ’s not sending signals . She may this first lady be ready to join the this first lady club     but she ’s clearly not happy .
