[ The social media stars have gotten a massive following as The social media stars videos have gone viral online , and Trump himself even brought them The social media stars to speak at one of his Trump . Now the dynamic duo , in this exclusive interview with Breitbart News , are hammering away at the Clinton dynasty —   which , if Trump Trump fortunate enough to get there , would be who the real estate magnate most likely faces off against in a general election .   Diamond told Breitbart Breitbart News asked what their thoughts Diamond on Clinton ’s Clinton Lives Matter breakdown in Philadelphia : It looked like he tried Clinton get the Black Lives Matter movement straightthoughts were on Clinton ’s Clinton’s Matter breakdown in Philadelphia . But Philadelphia me tell you what I do n’t understand , I do n’t understand how the media gives him a Clinton as to what he said Clinton okay but if Donald Trump would have repeated the same thing they would have considered him as being Donald Trump bigot or a racist . So I think it ’s a double standard in the media . Listen , the Black Lives Matter movement I am not fond of what they ’re doing they how they ’re doing they and how they ’re trying they relay their message okay they , Bill Clinton is going to have to face the fact that he did sign Bill Clinton crime bill into law that got thousands of black men locked up where they could n’t thousands of black men their sons or black men their daughters . black men ’re still thousands of black men jail locked up today because of the harsh crime a crime bill not giving anybody a pass to commit a crime , but in that crime bill you had people a crime bill even have a good ounce of marijuana still locked up today , but then you have people down there in Colorado selling drugs and they ai n’t getting locked up . So people think that ’s what people are looking at .   I ’m not a fan of the Clintons nor ’m fan of Bernie Sanders , I need a straight outsider like Donald Trump to come in and clean up this insider mess from both sides . So I think the only one who can get the job done is Donald Trump and he ’ll be the best Donald Trump American people Donald Trump Last week in Philadelphia , former U.

" I do n’t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got     kids hopped up on crack and sent them out into the street to murder other African the gang leaders who got     children —   maybe you thought they were good citizens , " Bill Clinton shouted other African American children Black Lives Matter hecklers in the audience at a rally .
