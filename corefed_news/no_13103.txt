Tim Kaine ( ) bragged the U. S. government had " bargained the U. S. government down to a fraction and paid a portion of the claim " and added " the U. S. government got hostages home . "   Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine ( said , " Chuck , here is the only thing new about this . This arrangement , the settlement of a claim with Iran , the payment of a portion of that settlement , hostages coming home , thank God . This was brief to Congress and the American public months ago . The only thing new this week , the only thing new is Donald Trump ’s claiming to have seen a    video of cash being given to the Iranians . " He continued,"I understand why Donald Trump’s is trying to make something out of it but look , you have two important issues . The first one is there was a legitimate claim against the United States . The the United States it down to the United States fraction . We ’re making the United States in international tribunals and we are having the United States made against us all the time . We bargained it the United States to a fraction and paid a portion of the claim , and we got hostages the United States . Both of those things are appropriate . I   understand why Trump is trying to make something out of it , but Trump ’s just no there there . " When asked if it looked like a ransom , Kaine said , " No , absolutely not . We do n’t the United States for hostages . We do n’t the United States for hostages , absolutely not . We ’re a the United States of laws and if there is a claim we think we the United States something the United States , we try to the United States the best way we can . the United States Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
