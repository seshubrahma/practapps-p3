Trump (@realDonaldTrump) has consistently referred to Common Core as a " disaster . " Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) has used the issue of the federal education program to emphasize that Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) is not a member of the Washington elite . " It ’s a way of taking care of the people in Washington that , frankly , I do n’t even think the people in Washington give a damn about education , half of the people in Washington , " Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) said last July , and at the South Carolina Tea Party Convention recently , Trump told Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) audience , " [ T]hese people in Washington   —    the bureaucrats   —    are making a fortune . the bureaucrats   do n’t give a damn about your kids in South Carolina . " Trump has given plain voice to the concerns of many parents throughout the country . What is not clear   —    at least for now   —    are the details of his education views . In November , a New Hampshire    activist asked Trump about the data collection aspect of the Common Core reform , and whether a New Hampshire   activist would close the loopholes in the federal privacy law to ensure students’ personal information remained private . " I did n’t know Common Core was so complicated , " a New Hampshire   activist responded . " Is n’t this ridiculous ? You could have local education , with local people , and local schools , and you do n’t have a problem . But some bureaucrat in Washington just wants to make money . " " I would close all of it , " Trump replied . " You have to have privacy . You have to have privacy . So I ’d close all of it . But , most of all , I ’d get everything out of Washington , ‘ cause that ’s where it ’s all emanating from . " That last statement suggests Trump would consider eliminating the U. S. Department of Education ( USED ) though Trump provides few details . The Wall Street Journal reported two weeks ago that Trump vowed to do " tremendous cutting " of the federal government , including the USED . Last August , Trump received a grade of    on the Common Core Report Card generated at The Pulse 2016 . The report suggests that while Trump has shown Trump is willing to stand and fight , Trump needs to include more details of Trump plans . " Trump has struck a chord with the Republican base , something many would have thought unlikely a year ago , " wrote Emmett McGroarty , executive director at American Principles in Action . " Citizens view Trump as having the courage and will to stand and fight , something that many GOP candidates have seemed to lack in years past . "
