  ( CNN ) CNN commentators and guest analysts offer CNN commentators and guest analysts take on Sunday night ’s second presidential candidate debate . The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors , David Gergen : Trump blows a big one   Whatever chance Trump still had of capturing the White House largely evaporated Sunday night in his Trump debate with Hillary Clinton .    Coming off the worst 10 days of any campaign in recent history , Trump Trump needed a win in order to reverse his Trump in the polls .   He Trump indeed better than in the his second debate with Hillary Clinton she was not Hillary Clinton commanding .   Even so , he Trump his Trump for victory in the first 20 minutes and could never fully recover .   CNN ’s poll found that by   % a majority of voters watching them thought she  % the Hillary Clinton of him Trump    His Trump came through a series of bizarre moments .   The first was his Trump    appearance with four female accusers of Bill Clinton . While a case can be made for    their claims       ago , the event seemed like a stunt and Trump never made real use of it in the Trump .    But more    still was the way he handled the disgusting video from 11 years ago in which he made vulgar he remarks .   Trump could possibly Trump achieved a measure of forgiveness if he had issued Trump sincere , thoughtful apology about his past as Trump as some ugly incidents in this campaign . But his apology was a sincere, thoughtful apology about his past as well as some ugly incidents in this campaign scope , seemed slightly dismissive , and went off track when he mixed ISIS Trump the conversation .    Adding insult to injury , he then went Trump an incredulous rant about Hillary ’s deleted emails . It was an entirely legitimate attack until he vowed that Trump elected , he would " Trump " his attorney general Trump appoint a special prosecutor to pursue her and that if Hillary were President Trump , she would be in Hillary . Say what ?   Those are the way    dictators act , jailing their political opponents . Those If he had done a half hour studying up ( something that seems beyond him ) he would he that he the law , a president can request     but not order     the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor and Justice must then make a decision independent from White House control .   Trump has a strange tropism toward Richard Nixon , forgetting that such safeguards were put in place precisely because of his abuses of power Trump    Overall , Trump ’s debate performance Trump given heart to his base supporters , stopping Trump slide , but did Trump to bring new voters into the fold , especially women .   Voter preferences are now hardening , and more trouble could lie ahead .    In the next few    , we will learn whether the RNC and other GOP stalwarts rally behind him or pull more plugs Trump   We will see , too we whether he and his vice presidential Trump , Trump Pence , patch up their differences .    Having he and his vice presidential pick, Michael Pence, moderator Anderson    that he never actually groped or Anderson Cooper any women the way he bragged about in the Anderson Cooper , Trump ’s apology also leaves him wide open to new Anderson Cooper contradicting his claims and to new Anderson Cooper of scurrilous remarks .   Hillary ’s team should n’t yet measure the drapes in the Oval Office , but I bet their transition folks are now Hillary’s team with fresh energy .   Victory     and perhaps a big one     seems almost within their grasp .   Errol Hillary’s team : Trump ’s shocking threat , Donald Trump , with his Trump the ropes , Trump out swinging . He made a few solid points Trump especially on reforming the tax code , but otherwise seemed irritated and irritable , in a continuation of the meltdown that began after a leaked video on Friday showed him making lewd comments about women Trump   Trump struggled with the town    Trump , frequently looming over Clinton as she answered questions , interrupting her Trump and bickering with moderators Trump Raddatz and Anderson Cooper over whether he got enough time to respond Trump questions .   At other points his assertions were downright shocking , Trump as his blunt threat to , as Trump , have a special investigator look into Hillary Clinton ’s emails and potentially jail her . He also admitted not Hillary Clinton’s paid Trump income tax for decades , implying that other wealthy Americans do the same and blaming Clinton for not reforming the tax Hillary Clinton’s during her years in the Senate . Hillary Clinton’s Another startling moment was Trump ’s admission he and his running mate , Trump Pence Trump have n’t discussed key Syria policies and actually disagree on the key issue of whether to launch military strikes at the forces of Syrian dictator Bashar    a direct contradiction of what Pence said at the recent vice presidential candidates’ debate . Trump did well enough to keep his campaign alive and give hope Trump his supporters     but his debate Trump did little to Trump Clinton ’s main angle of attack : that he ’s simply not qualified or Trump to serve as president .   Errol Louis is the host of " Inside City Hall , " a nightly political show on NY1 , a New York    channel . Tara Setmayer : Trump ’s strategy     Attack , attack , attack   Donald Trump ’s behavior during the Trump’s minutes of the debate was cringe worthy .   To no one ’s surprise there was no sign of the " humility " or " contrition " many , including his own supporters , called for in Trump’s to the devastating video released on Friday showing Trump bragging about groping women in the Trump’s vile terms .   Instead , he chose to pivot and go directly Trump’s the attack against Hillary Clinton every chance he got .      At times , Trump’s brought the level of discourse embarrassingly Trump’s with all sense of presidential decorum thrown out the window . Gone were the pleasantries and respect with Trump referring to Mrs. Clinton as a Trump’s ( she Hillary Clinton ) throughout the evening . Clearly this was done on purpose to diminish Clinton .   She handled it like a Hillary Clinton professional , Hillary Clinton her this like the adult in the room Hillary Clinton Trump once again demonstrated why he ’s Trump’s unfit for the presidency Trump’s    However , once the conversation turned to more substantive topics , Trump was able to focus more on Trump’s ’s failed record , forcing her to Hillary Clinton defense for much of Trump’s night , particularly on her emails ,   Obamacare and energy Trump’s .      Trump did falter badly on Syria . Trump’s seemingly sided with Putin over his Trump’s running mate , emphatically saying Trump’s disagreed with Mike Pence on the Trump’s and had n’t even spoken to him about the crisis in Syria . Trump’s Heading into this debate , Syria ’s campaign was possibly mortally wounded Trump’s performed well enough to stop the bleeding Trump’s for now . But did he do anything to close the gap with Trump’s swing state constituencies he needs to win ? Doubtful . Fortunately Trump’s Trump , Hillary Clinton is such a flawed Trump’s , she was unable to land the knockout blow . Hillary Clinton This one was a draw .   Tara Setmayer is former communications director for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ,    and a CNN political commentator .    Tim Stanley : Will Trump ’s good night make a difference ? Trump’s Trump had a good night . It Trump’s because it had to start poorly discussion of his " locker It " banter was bound to Trump’s personally embarrassing . He sounded like he was giving a legal deposition Trump’s When Clinton Trump’s the moderators demanded greater clarity , he lost his temper and called Bill Clinton an Trump’s of Trump’s . I suspect he Clinton intend to do that . The Trump’s has skin as thin as gossamer . Trump’s that the debate turned to Clinton , and Trump ’s constant attacks were effective . The problem Clinton that while Trump is an eccentric candidate , Clinton is a poor one . Trump struggled to explain why she Clinton running , overused cliches and Clinton lawyerly answers that sounded Clinton she was squirming . She even let Trump tell a good gag Clinton her expense about Clinton Lincoln . Trump how do we judge victory Clinton this unpredictable climate ? For Trump it will be warm words Trump senior Republicans and an end to GOP withdrawals from his campaign GOP   this campaign GOP spell victory in November .

Revolutionized American Politics . "    Sally Kohn : A depressing spectacle , I ’m depressed .   I ’m depressed that Donald Trump could be caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting ’m try to laugh it all off in a debate as " locker room talk . "   But what were the debate moderators supposed to do Sunday night ?   Spend more than a few minutes conveying America ’s utter disgust at this latest example of Trump ’s pattern of misogyny ?   Trump , a few minutes is enough I guess .   So on to policy , right ?   No , because almost as depressing was Trump ’s repeated unwillingness to actually answer the questions that were posed Trump’s .   How would Trump ensure Trump    conditions are still covered by health insurance without some Trump’s of universal coverage mandate ?   We do n’t know , he did n’t answer .    What would Trump do about the refugee Trump’s in Syria ?   We do n’t    , he did n’t answer   — Syria twice .   Question We question Trump’s Trump said nothing .   I mean Trump words came out of his mouth but they barely formed sentences and they definitely did n’t form Trump’s .   He basically vomited fragments of nothingness all over they Clinton and America . Trump’s And like Clinton , we all just had Hillary Clinton there   —    America and annoyed Hillary Clinton     What ’s especially depressing is that our media , let alone our democracy , seems    to handle anything like Trump .   Martha Raddatz and Anderson Trump our , Martha Raddatz Anderson Cooper does n’t work because Trump does n’t Trump about facts .   Trump fact , he denies he ’s lying as he ’s Trump and Trump , for extra Trump , accuses everyone else of being liars .   I keep waiting for the ghost of George Orwell to show up on the debate stage and bite Trump on the ankles .   Donald Trump Trump a perverse man who is Trump only our democracy but the very concept of truth .   He tried to win the debate just like one Trump a limbo contest   —    by lowering the bar .   That should depress all of us .     Sally Kohn , a CNN political commentator , is an activist and columnist . Follow her on Twitter : @sallykohn .   CNN supports Hillary Clinton for the presidency . S. E. Cupp : A night of missed opportunities , After the her the presidency it ’s difficult to determine on what basis either candidate would win Sunday night ’s debate . Donald Trump was emerging out of the fallout from Trump , embarrassing , potentially fatal recording of him suggesting he ’s used his celebrity to sexually assault Trump . Trump the hours Trump the debate , he gathered four women who claim they ’d been victims Trump either Hillary Clinton ’s husband or her to exploit their pain for Hillary Clinton’s gain .   Clinton Hillary Clinton’s four women who claim they’d been victims of either Hillary Clinton’s husband or her to exploit their pain for his own personal gain the Trump hand , suffered a significant Clinton if overshadowed , leak about either Hillary Clinton’s husband or her previously private speeches .   But it ’s safe Clinton say , Clinton came in with the advantage , and Trump came Clinton with an almost impossible recovery mission . He did little to recover , but it ’s Trump’s Clinton to see where she used that advantage effectively . He was undisciplined and Clinton , whining about the moderators Clinton him it , which is never a winning strategy . Clinton missed obvious openings to attack Clinton , for example Clinton on the revelations she ’s Clinton for open borders in those private speeches Clinton He lurked behind her uncomfortably while she spoke , a Clinton he was Clinton unaware of Clinton maybe actually totally aware Clinton .   But while Clinton was cool and collected , and seemed far more Clinton than he did , she had a clear strategy to wait Clinton Trump to Clinton himself , instead of going for the Trump on the Trump issue . She had an opportunity tonight to end his campaign for Clinton , this campaign baiting him into a Clinton or just throwing a knockout . I Clinton not sure she did either .   Undecided and independent voters will have Clinton decide if they respect her for taking the high ground , or judge her for Clinton to more aggressively call him out .   Clinton E. Cupp is Undecided and independent voters author of Clinton Losing Our Religion : The Liberal Media ’s Attack on Christianity , "    of " Why You ’re Wrong About the Right " and a columnist at the New York Daily News . Jeff Yang : Moderators were winners , Trump was not   It ’s hard to imagine that there are pundits who are calling this debate a draw Trump’s or even a " victory on points " for Trump . He blustered , he blathered , this debate a    trail of spite and fury across the stage Trump’s and Trump’s it all Trump’s Clinton remained Trump’s , collected and , dare I say it , presidential .   Every slur and slander from 30 Hillary Clinton of unhinged Clinton hatred was dragged before the audience of " uncommitted voters " ( is there really such a thing as a Hillary Clinton American uncommitted voter ? ) . None of the attacks stuck , because they seemed nasty and irrelevant , and put Trump in the position of being a barker for a particularly unpleasant sideshow .   What did stick was None of the attacks Trump’s that even a modulated Trump is entirely unfit for office . His fascistic vow to investigate and jail Clinton upon election his throwing of Trump’s running mate Mike Pence Clinton the Trump’s Trump Train his inability to directly answer any of Trump’s moderators’ questions Trump’s none of these could Mike Pence comfort to members of his party that a Trump win would be anything but Pyrrhic .   And as for the moderators Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz : Trump’s someone Anderson Cooper into his drinking water ? This Martha Raddatz first time we ’ve seen this kind of muscular , unyielding and disciplined questioning from the floorkeepers at a debate , and the PEDs that the candidates actually engage the topics being asked was bracing and refreshing . More of the same at debate 3 , please . .. if there is one after this utter fiasco of a week for the Trump campaign .

" He is the    of " I Am Jackie Chan : My Life in Action " and editor of the graphic novel anthologies " Secret Identities " and " Shattered . "   "The Brian Lehrer Show." Haq : Trump failed to bury the ’Access Hollywood’ tape , It was impossible to tune into this debate without thinking about the leaked tape of Trump’s ’s comments about women . So it ’s a good thing the moderators brought it up at the this debate Trump a chance Trump’s reiterate his apology , let Clinton get a jab in , and move his campaign forward .   Trump Clinton Trump’s the moderators Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz take the it to Clinton the story and instead Trump on the Trump locker room talk " explanation . Trump failed to show his understanding of modern social norms , instead sticking to a Trump stuck in the Trump of the ’70s Playboy mansion . And he failed to assuage his Republican colleagues , who are abandoning his campaign in droves Trump that he can Trump this campaign voters .   Even scarier Trump Trump openly admitted to not Trump laws designed to protect women in response to a direct Trump from moderators , Trump " would n’t say that " grabbing women ’s genitalia is considered sexual assault . Trump Friday night , President Obama signed the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Rights Act . By contrast Trump spent the next 72 hours defending " locker room talk " and rape culture . Expect the narrative and evidence of Trump being harmful to women to dominate this coming week .   Nayyera Haq Trump a former Trump House senior director and State Department spokesperson under the Obama administration , Nayyera is a regular commentator on politics and current affairs . She supports Hillary Clinton . Peniel Joseph : It Nayyera Haq the ’Hunger Games’ With the revelation of Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump ’s bragging about sexual assault during a 2005 taping of an entertainment Hillary Clinton , the Nayyera Haq presidential election has officially turned into a Nayyera Hunger Games " styled nightmare for the American people .    Trump ’s repulsive comments about women cast a shadow over Sunday night ’s second presidential debate in Trump Louis . Over the weekend , scores of    members of the Republican establishment finally reached their breaking point , openly calling Donald J. Trump’s to drop out of the race .   Moderator Anderson Cooper bluntly asked Trump whether he Trump his comments about kissing Anderson Cooper Anderson Cooper amounted to a confession of sexual assault Trump    Trump scores of   members of the Republican establishment Trump comments as " locker room talk " and claimed to have " great respect for women . Trump Democratic Trump candidate Hillary Clinton identified Trump as unfit to lead , by virtue of the latest controversy and the litany of racist , sexist and Trump comments the billionaire real estate developer has made throughout the campaign .   Trump , who invited to the this campaign women who claimed to be victims of sexual harassment and assault by former President Bill Clinton , responded with a surreal defense of his own words by attacking former President Bill Clinton as a sexual predator enabled by Hillary Clinton .   second presidential debate in St. Louis bizarre presidential debate in history featured Trump , a candidate rejected by many of his own party ’s leaders , threatening to appoint a special former President Bill Clinton to reopen the FBI former President Bill Clinton Clinton countered Trump’s she was grateful a man like Trump was not president . " Because you ’d be in jail Clinton " Trump Clinton back , in a line Trump served as red meat to his core base of supporters .    Faced with insurrection in the ranks of the Republican Party on a historic scale , Trump fought back through his most unvarnished Trump of anger , petulance and disingenuous concern for the plight of    Trump Latinos , two groups he ’s routinely offended during his campaign .     Clinton found her rhetorical footing answering questions this campaign Trump that Trump ’s Trump for bans on Muslims have greatly contributed to Clinton Clinton Clinton a nuanced vision of American society that included Trump Trump and differentiated between religious Trump who advocate terror and ordinary Clinton who happen to practice the Islamic faith .   Ultimately , this second debate , which featured no opening handshake between two candidates who apparently despise one another , illustrated more than just the polarizing nature of contemporary American politics .   Trump ’s fitness for the presidency has now been openly questioned by some of the leading figures in his own party , Trump former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice ( who asked him to withdraw ) and Arizona the presidency McCain ( who rescinded his endorsement ) . Donald J. Trump’s fisticuffs between Trump and Clinton over emails , tax returns , and sexual assault have turned a Donald J. Trump’s contest into a brutal spectator sport filled with Clinton exchanges that made the Donald J. Trump’s unfit to Trump’s watched by children . A largely substance free Donald J. Trump’s of the worst kind of political theater   Trump, who invited to the debate three women who claimed to be victims of sexual harassment and assault by former President Bill Clinton largely devoid of serious policy discussion   —    this debate exemplified how modern day American politics has reached a historic low .     Peniel Joseph is the Barbara Jordan Chair in Political Values and Ethics and the founding director of the Center for the Study of this debate Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin , where he is also a professor of Peniel Joseph He is the author of several books , most recently " Stokely : A Life . "   Julian Zelizer : Clinton missed a knockout punch , Donald Trump attempted to move away from the " Access Hollywood " controversy by Peniel Joseph to Clinton themes that animated his primary Peniel Joseph . He returned to threats from ISIS , illegal Trump’s Court justices and Hillary Clinton ’s scandals   Clinton    from    Clinton paid speeches to her husband ’s sexual past .   At moments he lashed out against Clinton in Trumpian fashion , going so far as to call her the " devil " and saying that if Hillary Clinton president she Clinton be in jail . He painted her as a liar Clinton professional politician who says one thing and then Clinton something else Clinton   If the goal was Clinton stop Clinton at least temporarily , the incessant discussion of his comments on the bus with Billy Bush and the calls for him to step down , Trump was successful . He probably    Clinton of his base and turned attention back to Clinton ’s controversies Clinton There were several moments when Clinton found herself Clinton the defense and stumbled Clinton her responses . The problem is Clinton the debate ca n’t remake the basic character Trump this Clinton or the problems that he has Clinton . The " Access Hollywood " tapes were the tip of a very Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . He apologized for the comments Clinton yet without much gusto . On top of that , there are very likely more Trump controversies on Clinton way .   The long list of prominent Republicans who have announced they now will not vote for Trump is well known . The deep record of polarizing and controversial positions and statements wo n’t go away .   Within his comments on the bus with Billy Bush itself , there Trump many occasions when Trump reminded undecided voters about why so many Republicans are not on his side . When he threatened Trump put his opponent in jail on live prominent Republicans who have announced they now he crossed another boundary in campaign history . He even seems to disagree about policy with his vice presidential running mate . Trump The reason the tape had such an impact was because of Trump Trump has been Trump the kind of Trump that he has run since entering Trump race . It is hard to see Trump this debate enables Trump to broaden his Trump base , which is essential if he wants to win .   While Trump was able to use Trump Trump to shift Trump away from the recording , he did Trump score a " win " in terms of the race quality of the debate ( his answers were filled with misstatements , vague references and this debate itself on unrelated issues ) Trump he did n’t erase the problems that he has created for his party . Trump , Clinton did n’t accomplish this debate itself of " knockout " punch that her supporters were hoping Trump .   Julian Zelizer is a professor Clinton history and public affairs at Princeton University and Trump New America Clinton . He is Trump author of " Trump Carter " and " The Fierce Urgency of Now : Lyndon Johnson , the Republican Party and the Battle for the Great Society . " Frida Ghitis : Trump showed he does n’t get it , The top question Julian Zelizer ’s mind was how Trump would handle the issue of the Trump in Trump he speaks in Trump Julian Zelizer ways about women . On that topic , he Trump he absolutely does not get it . " This Trump locker room talk , " he said several times ( then awkwardly Trump to Trump about ISIS . ) And even though he added , " I ’m not Trump of it . I apologize . .. , " the repeated mantra that it was " Trump room talk " showed he believes it ’s only natural , really OK for men to refer to women in those terms , and perhaps even to sexually Trump women in the way he ISIS in that tape . That may satisfy his core supporters . In fact , his entire performance may have played well with Trump most devoted followers , but it ’s hard Trump imagine that many independents watched this Trump it decided to vote for Trump . Trump base feels good now , but he did n’t persuade many undecideds , and certainly did n’t peel away any Clinton supporters . Trump came across as a rude , Trump and nasty man . " She has tremendous hate in her heart , Clinton he Trump Trump looming his entire performance Hillary Clinton and pacing while she spoke . this debate itself Clinton , she sat listening his base never interrupting Trump , even when he lied a painful sacrifice Clinton Clinton decided she must Trump in order Clinton to be seen as " pushy Trump " or " Hillary Clinton " or some Clinton " unfeminine Clinton trait . In one    moment , Trump threatened to put Hillary Clinton in prison if he becomes president , marking a new low for American democracy in an election season Trump with new lows .   Some of his Trump on Clinton landed forcefully , such as on her emails and speeches . Clinton could have defended herself Hillary Clinton and attacked Trump frequently . Clinton But the overwhelming tone of the Clinton was one of Trump Clinton harsh personal attacks Clinton his rival , pleasing    and turning off voters trying to make up their minds . On foreign Trump , it was also one Trump statement after another . He said he disagreed with his running mate Mike Pence and his roundly praised statements on Syria . second presidential debate in St. Louis he would consider attacking Russia and the Syrian regime if they do n’t stop the slaughter in Aleppo . Trump said no , and offered a policy that surely brought cheers in Damascus and Syria .   Then he made bizarre statements , Trump as " Russia is new in terms of nuclear , we He old and He . " Trump Trump old He , such as the claim that Mike Pence opposed He war in Iraq . When Clinton said that claim Russia and the Syrian regime been Trump ( as it has ) he cut in , Trump into the microphone and uttering " Has Clinton been debunked , Syria sounding like Alec Baldwin playing Donald Trump Clinton On the whole Russia Trump put on a performance that undoubtedly made his diehard fans feel reassured , but one that confirmed that he does not understand what Trump wrong with his Trump’s women , Trump Muslims and toward Russia , and reminding us that he Trump a jumbled , dangerous foreign policy , Trump continues to undercut America ’s fundamental democratic traditions .

Haroon Moghul : The real message of the night , We should n’t have invaded Iraq , Donald Trump now Russia . But he also says we should ’ve " taken their oil . " Guarding immobile , sometimes New America infrastructure , while plundering and pillaging Frida Ghitis nation is colonialism . Had Trump’s actually paid attention to " Trump’s their oil , " at least they would n’t have been surprised Frida Ghitis " grab them by the     . "   Because Islamophobia is us is racism . My Iraq , my race , my wealth , my gender , us what have you , permits me to do unto you as I ’d never accept being done unto me . Take their oil . Settle their land . Grope their bodies .   In more Republicans to a question about Islamophobia more Republicans Trump told an allegedly undecided Muslim voter — more Republicans a term that makes about as much sense as " clean coal "     that Trump have to keep in mind the problem of terrorism .   If the moderators had been bolder , they ’d have asked Donald Trump if the violence by radical white supremacists My God, my race, my wealth, my gender, or what have you to infringe on My God, my race, my wealth, my gender, or what have you rights of white My God, my race, my wealth, my gender, or what have you generally .   We should not , as Melania Trump pleaded , simply forgive her husband ’s indiscretions Trump’s move on to " the important issues . " The average Trump voter is not motivated by economic anxiety . Stop finding politically correct terms for Trump’s . They ’d rather we Trump’s decades Trump the moderators progress than yield an inch on exploitative structures that keep them powerful .   As we were reminded this Friday , that privilege is n’t ever benign . It came about through violence , and maintains itself through violence : over bodies , over land , over culture . I ’d hoped Trump would be out of the race by this weekend , but it seems even sexual predation is n’t The average Trump voter to wake our country up . Do n’t ask if Clinton won or lost . Ask what The average Trump voter to us .   Haroon Moghul is a senior fellow at the Center for Global Policy Clinton that privilege next book , " How to be that privilege Muslim , " will be the race 2017 . Raul Reyes : Trump ’s    performance   Here is a note to all candidates at presidential debates : ’d you find yourself engaged in combative behavior Trump the moderators , you have lost the debate .   At the combination town    debate that Politico described as Haroon Moghul most consequential forum in history , " Donald Trump repeatedly clashed with Haroon Moghul moderators and made himself look awfully small over the course of 90 minutes .   Overall , Hillary Clinton ’s steady presence triumphed over Trump ’s typically uneven performance .    From the Trump’s Trump seemed exhausted and " low energy " Trump’s he faced off with Clinton . this debate itself first question of the night , about Trump each candidate was modeling appropriate behavior for young Trump , was Hillary Clinton was certainly expected .   But Trump blew Trump . the moderators missed his chance to show genuine contrition for his recently revealed behavior .   Instead his explanation for Hillary Clinton lewd Trump about the Trump Access Trump " host and a soap opera Trump was that it was " locker Trump talk . Trump   This was a weak rationalization that will not improve his standing with women     or anyone who has ever been in a locker room in their life .       Trump ’s body language Trump especially revealing tonight .   He fidgeted .   He paced the stage .   At times he lurked Trump , giving off a creepy stalker vibe .   Trump , just like Trump last debate , he seemed stricken with Trump case of the sniffles .   These were all distractions on top of his rambling answers .   Consider that Trump answered a question from a Muslim woman about Islamophobia by apparently encouraging Hillary Clinton women    or anyone who has ever been in a locker room in their life of Muslim Americans Trump   Or that he may have Trump that he did not pay federal income taxes for years .             Worse , once again Trump could not resist interrupting Trump , or making coarse Trump     like his statement that if he were president , he would have a Trump prosecutor investigate her and Clinton she would be jailed .   Does Trump not understand that Trump the judicial branch Trump go after your political opponents is Clinton the law Clinton   His statement that Clinton has Trump tremendous hate in her heart " showed a stunning lack of    from the man who has disparaged Latinos Trump immigrants , Clinton Gold Star family , a Clinton Miss Universe , and people with disabilities     among others .       For her part , Clinton provided clear answers on her positions on everything from the Affordable Care Act to Syria . She was prepared for the inevitable questions about Clinton and her deleted emails Clinton   Her best answer of the evening was likely when she enumerated the qualifications she would look for in a Supreme Court justice .    This was the rare evening where Trump faced a high bar in terms of what he had to accomplish .   Not only did he not manage       damage control of Trump latest scandal , it seems unlikely that he Trump over Syria undecided or independent voters       . Trump However , he likely may have Trump       with his boorish ,       behavior Trump full display .    Toward the       of this town       debate Trump featured relatively few questions from the Trump , Trump described the American nuclear program as " we ’re old , we ’re tired , we ’re exhausted . " He could have been Trump his    performance .   Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors Trump Follow him @RaulAReyes . Trump Jones : A pitch to his base , If I were watching a Vegas lounge act , I may have gotten a few chuckles at some of Donald Trump ’s Trump comebacks during the debate . Too bad , this is a campaign for the highest we in the land we and not a comedy night . It ’s not    most voters are Raul Reyes substance Trump’s and clear vision to move America forward . We deserve so much more from Raul Reyes who wants to be President . After coming out of the box sounding more like a playground punk , Trump   picked it up a bit when he took Hillary Clinton this debate itself for deleting thousands of emails while she was Secretary of State Trump She apologized ( again ) took responsibility Trump again ) and said if she had it to this over again , she would not have used her private server New America Clinton   New America wrong . She was investigated and cleared of Hillary Clinton acts . You either believe her , or not Hillary Clinton Move on . Clinton in the Hillary Clinton S. Clinton at 5 . 0 % that ’s the box . 9 Hillary Clinton out Clinton work Americans . For blacks Hillary Clinton Hispanics , the picture Hillary Clinton bleaker ( Black 8 . 3 % Hispanics 6 . 4 % ) . And notice that Trump did not deny sending jobs to China by buying    Chinese metal to build his buildings . Not exactly a winning jobs strategy for Americans Trump   Voters are worried about sending their children to college , about Social Security Trump clean air , terrorism . Will the next President send our sons and daughters to war ? Trump does n’t seem to be too worried about the Middle East . He shockingly admitted that he " had n’t talked to Pence " about Trump , and when pressed by moderator Martha Raddatz , he could n’t Trump up with one Trump answer about how he would handle the war in Syria . One of the major issues of our Trump and he has no plan Voters That ’s beyond troubling Trump   But then again , I suspect , talking about foreign policy , a solid jobs Trump , college costs are not topics that come up during " locker room banter , " where apparently Trump does his best talking , Aleppo about groping women and encouraging sex assault . So while Trump may have looked more poised than what we Trump in Trump bombastic behavior during the Syria debate , he did little to appeal to voters Trump of his diehard followers , for whom he can do Trump wrong . And he ’ll need more Trump them to win .   I ’ve been Trump my share of locker rooms Trump sports over the past 20 years Trump while lewd talk is real , I ’ve yet to hear an athlete use the crude , childlike words Trump used describing how he approaches women : " Grab them by the p —   y. . .. You can do anything . "   Trump was in a tough position , after Trump ’s " groping " video was released . She did well to avoid wading too deep into Trump voters gutter . The win goes to Trump for staying on course . ( And Martha Raddatz , the best moderator thus far . ) Trump , a founding editor of ESPN Magazine Hillary Clinton former vice president at ESPN , has worked as a producer an athlete as a reporter at Hillary Clinton women York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer . She was named a 2010 Woman of Hillary Clinton Year by Women in Sports and Events , is a    of " Say It Loud : An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete , " and CEO of the Push Marketing Group .   Tim Naftali : Bewildering debate did n’t move the needle , This debate was bewildering . The town hall forum at its best brings the issues down to the level of the individual citizen . This one did not and for that reason will not move many voters in either direction . Trump decided to bring his stump style to the national debate stage and Hillary Clinton responded more combatively than in the first debate . There was little Trump of a policy Trump , but with the exception of a few moments on health care and on the selection of a Supreme Court justice , Bewildering debate the night descended into charges and countercharges . Trump Bewildering debate better but his arguments on foreign policy , Hillary Clinton though forceful , still did not meet the reality test . Clinton was clear but Trump as crisp this Trump . A draw . Tim Naftali , a CNN presidential historian and clinical associate professor of history and public service the first debate University , is writing a new biography of President John F. Kennedy .    Ruth   : Just words , folks ?   They matter ,   Supreme Court ’s Hillary Clinton words , folks , " was Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s refrain during this debate . And yet words served him well in his strategies of denial , obfuscation , and direct attack .    Trump tried to talk his way out of his most recent offenses toward women , claiming his words were " just locker room talk " while in Trump same sentence bizarrely Trump in ISIS as Trump aid and a distraction : those crotch Trump ? Not anything important , like ISIS chopping peoples’ heads off . folks I mention I will defeat ISIS ? If you had trouble following his logic here or at other moments of the first debate , you were not alone .     Clinton had a him enough performance , but some of Trump fire was missing . Perhaps she wanted to give Trump the space to damage himself , but his repeated gambit of turning policy answers into personal attacks on her warranted a more energetic response .     Trump winner of this debate Trump The gentleman Trump the end who asked the candidates Hillary Clinton there ’s ISIS they respect about one another . Hillary Clinton reminded us that words ISIS Hillary Clinton . They can incite violence they prepare action . Yet they can also build bridges , something we ’ll need Trump awful Hillary Clinton of after this election .   Ruth    is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University .

"   Frank Sesno :   Dark night in St. Louis , I ’ve watched , the first debate written about and studied presidential debates for a long time , but I ’ve never seen the candidates like this one . It was more tawdry , more personal , and the candidates that any political the candidates I ’ve ever witnessed the candidates Everyone felt the effects . I us next to a Trump supporter and directly in front of a Ruth   . They maintained decorum , but wrapped it in New York University The debate broke little Ruth   Trump substantively , but the tone set a new standard for nasty , personal and brutish .   Donald Trump looked like a wounded animal on stage     pacing , lashing out in anger , snarling the words " disaster " and accusing This one Trump lies " so many times , I lost count . When he threatened to appoint a special prosecutor if he ’s elected and send Trump to jail , the room gasped . So did my Trump and Clinton    Trump focus group . }    Hillary Clinton Trump more controlled . She perched on her chair whenever she could , perhaps to keep Trump disdain for Clinton exploding into the open .   What do you suppose she was thinking when Trump went after Bill Clinton ’s affairs and her role running interference Trump There was some debate on the issues     Syria , the Supreme Court , Hillary Clinton and jobs . But the Hillary Clinton was on Hillary Clinton candidates , Hillary Clinton trying to outmaneuver , insult Hillary Clinton corner the other . a special prosecutor St. Louis made history of sorts and I ’ll Hillary Clinton lots of things about it . Like when the house lights Hillary Clinton down in the minutes before the debate and it struck me just how dark it got .
