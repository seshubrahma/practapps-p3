Thursday on Fox News Channel ’s " The Kelly File , " Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer speculated that although this was a " terrible week " for Republican presidential    Donald Trump , Republican presidential   Donald Trump will likely recover , noting that the predictions of Republican presidential   Donald Trump ’s demise have proven to be incorrect throughout this election season .   " Look , I ’ve said it many times and I was wrong every single time , " Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer said . " We ’ve heard the expression ‘ peak Trump’ about as often as We ’ve heard ‘ peak oil’ for the last 50 years and oil is gushing all over the world . So look , I think it is likely that oil’ recovers . But if there is going to be one incident or one series of incidents happening together as we ’ve seen in this week that would actually stop oil’ and actually put a question mark in some of oil’ supporters , this would be it . this was a terrible week .
