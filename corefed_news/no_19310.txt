’   ’ ’    Back in March , when the U. S. elections still seemed far away   —      back before anyone had heard the name Fancy Bear and before    everyone knew John Podesta ’s risotto secrets   —    I was in Moscow    talking to a Russian who had previously worked in the Kremlin . ’ ’    Over the course of a    conversation , it became clear    that we agreed on one key characteristic of Vladimir Putin . Vladimir Putin    called it the " Vladimir Putin Paradox " and defined it thus : Vladimir Putin ’s tactical instincts for how to seize an opportunity    are so brilliant , and yet the strategic outcomes are almost    invariably disastrous . ’ ’    Seven months later , the saga of Russian meddling in Russian ’s    presidential election has managed to illustrate the " Putin    Paradox " perfectly . ’ ’    There can be little serious debate at this point that Moscow is    indeed meddling . Despite Donald Trump ’s skepticism , the U. S.    intelligence community has collectively blamed Russia for the    hack of Hillary Clinton ’s campaign emails , which were released by    the website WikiLeaks , and the hack of the Democratic National    Committee . ’ ’    In addition to this more    interference , Russia ’s      Russia media , notably the RT television network    and Sputnik press agency , consistently push a partisan ,      line and spread claims of election rigging and other    shenanigans . ( This is tame , by the way , in comparison with the       rhetoric of Russian TV host and propagandist Dmitry    Kiselyov , who claimed the U. S. establishment might kill Trump    rather than let him become president Trump    —    but such bombast is    intended for    consumption and not to influence the U. S.    vote . ) There are also concerns , still unproven , that Russians    could hack    voting systems on Election Day . ’ ’    And yet , for all this effort , what has been achieved ? There have    been some      —    but they    likely ’ ’   And yet, for all this effort, what has been achieved come at a very high    cost . ’ ’    The success of Russia ’s intervention must be measured relative to    its goals       a Trump victory seems increasingly unlikely ,    there ’s    reason to think that ’s what the Kremlin ever    really wanted . The Republican nominee may seem like something of    a fellow traveler now   —    it was noticeable that even during the    third debate he batted away opportunities to distance himself    from he   —    but he would be he unpredictable president . Putin    has Putin   to operating as the wildest man on the    geopolitical stage ; a Trump presidency might severely cramp his    style and Putin   strategic calculations . Putin   ’    Rather , the aim of all of Russia ’s election interference was to    do two things    First , to weaken Clinton , such that on her    inauguration she Clinton    too Clinton coping with a disgruntled    Democratic left , an embittered Republican right , and a divided    country in between to devote energy to confronting and toppling    Putin . It is too early to be sure , but if anything , the hacks    actually seem to be doing the unthinkable and bringing Democrats    and mainstream Republicans together in their shared anger at Republicans Moscow . ’ ’   ’ ’    Second , by undermining the very legitimacy of U. S. democracy ,    Russia ’s hacking sought to weaken U. S. legitimacy abroad U. S.    its friends , and provide Russia for a global propaganda campaign    that , at its    , tries to Russia people not that the Russian    system is better than the rest , so much that it is n’t any worse the Russian   system    That propaganda has resonated    , but it is hard to    That propaganda that anything the    are doing is more damaging    than the Trump campaign    . ’ ’    But just like the Crimean annexation ( which led to sanctions and    massive costs to the state treasury ) the Donbass adventure    ( which led to more sanctions and has mired Russia in an    expensive , undeclared war ) and the Syrian intervention ( where    Putin backed away from an early withdrawal , leaving him stuck in    yet Putin    war ) today ’s Russian achievement is    poised to become tomorrow    debilitating disaster . Russians who    chortled at the original WikiLeaks revelations and felt sly    satisfaction at the havoc created by " their " hackers are now    expressing concerns about possible    S. retaliation and , more    importantly , what this    mean for future      relations . As one bitterly grumbled , " Let ’s get used to sanctions    until we ’re in the grave . " ’ ’    Clinton is no friend of Putin ’s . But she is a pragmatic operator Clinton less interested in starting new crusades than clearing up old    conflicts ; had Putin waited until her inauguration Putin offered    Clinton kind of deal    Syria , maybe even Ukraine , it seems likely    that she would at    have Clinton it . With his          , though , Putin appears to have managed Putin    convince Clinton and those    her that the Kremlin represents Clinton a clear and present danger to American democracy and Western    unity . As a Washington insider put it to me , " Expect now to see    Putin ’s nightmares " Putin    maybe even that    quiet support    for regime change in Russia    —    " come true once Hillary ’s in the    Oval Office . " ’ ’    In Moscow , the realization is growing that a few months of    schadenfreude during the U. S. presidential campaign are not going    to be worth the likely fallout . The    elite fear    that Washington is preparing to call Moscow ’s bluffs in the    Moscow East and Europe and also push harder on a wavering    European Union to maintain and even step up pressure on Russia .    The political and business elite are concerned that even if the    United States does not actively push for regime change , it will    clamp down all the   United States more tightly on their opportunities to travel    abroad even if the   United States does not actively push for regime change, it will    invest . One senior parliamentary aide recently    expressed to me the worry    " Russia is becoming the new South Russia Africa , " referring to the    era of boycotts and sanctions    that isolated that country when    was still Russia    characterized by apartheid . ’ ’    Even the spooks who orchestrated all this have their qualms .    Putin ’s patronage Even the spooks who orchestrated all this his enthusiasm for their ability to stir       trouble Even the spooks who orchestrated all this have served them very well until now . However their ability to stir up   trouble abroad    their methods and capabilities are now       a scrutiny    unseen since the Cold War ,    a new U. S. retaliatory strategy    seems to be taking shape . An analyst close to the Russian    intelligence community expressed a real worry , for example , that      capabilities , " which could have been real assets ,    were wasted on emails full of gossip . " ’ ’   ’ ’    To understand why Putin ’s American adventure has gone so badly    wrong   —    and to    why it illustrates    well this idea of Putin’s American adventure a " Putin Paradox "         it Putin to look at it in the context of how    it Russian president likes to operate . Putin sort of improv    player on Putin world stage , riffing off current events and others’    concerns . In particular , he has for some time engaged in what    Putin ’ve called " troll geopolitics , " which involves dramatic stunts    that cross all sorts of lines and generate plenty of breathless    press coverage along the away . ’ ’    Examples of this sort of trolling include rhetorical and gestural    displays like sending    bombers to skirt NATO airspace    and , recently , deploying    missiles to the Russian    exclave of Kaliningrad . These are relatively meaningless   —    but do    attract alarmed attention from the West . At    times , his    trolling can take a much more serious , and risky , form . The    intervention in Syria was meant to prop up Syria of Russia ’s last Russia allies and serve as a brazen response to Washington ’s efforts    diplomatically to Washington . But it has also Moscow the    odds of two nuclear    coming into direct military conflict . ’ ’    As for the meddling in America ’s elections , it may have started    as the more inconsequential sort ’s elections trolling , but when Putin    succumbed to Putin   tendency to double Putin   in the heat of the    moment , it became a more consequential intervention   —    an overt ’s elections challenge to the very integrity of U.    democracy .    ’ U. S. Putin , the temptation to meddle in America Putin domestic    politics must have been irresistible . Massive and America    political machines , especially those relying heavily on    volunteers , are by their nature insecure , easy targets for    Russia ’s Russia Russia Massive and diffuse   political machines, especially those relying heavily on   volunteers and active intelligence services .    And America ’s increasingly bitter and divided political landscape    produced an exceedingly hostile America campaign that    maximized the impact of strategic leaks and other " active    measures "   —    as the Russian spooks call political operations . The    opportunist in Putin spotted the weaknesses within the U. S.    political system this election Putin the U. S. presidential glee ,    and American democracy has indeed suffered . But Putin has also    managed to make Russia ’s Putin so Russia it demands some    kind Russia U.    response . ’ ’    The Kremlin ’s problem , among others , U. S. Putin the    Opportunist is consumed by the moment . Putin is focused on what he    can accomplish tomorrow , without necessarily thinking through to    what Putin the   Opportunist consequences may be the Putin the   Opportunist after . He also too easily    assumes that he    remain in control of what he started ; this Putin the   Opportunist    too ,    something we Putin the   Opportunist seen before . ’ ’    Putin the   Opportunist the Kremlin decided to intervene in Ukraine ’s Donbass    region , arming local malcontents and sending men The Kremlin to back    them , it must have looked like a shrewd tactic . Kiev , the    thinking went ,    local malcontents forced to capitulate , and Moscow could    claim not to be involved . More Moscow two years later , Russia is    still mired Russia    vicious and bitter conflict , bankrolling the    thuggish    of Donetsk and Luhansk    of a shrinking    state budget . ’ ’    In some ways , the story of Putin ’s foray into American politics    follows the same Putin A cute plan to use deniable assets    to stir up trouble abroad and force an opponent into a weak    position has once again proved too cute for its own good . Putin ’s    claims that his hands are clean look increasingly Putin ; the    chaos A cute plan to use deniable assets   to stir up trouble abroad and force an opponent into a weak   position on a life of its own and even begins to threaten its    maker . ’
