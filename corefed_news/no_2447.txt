BEDMINSTER , N. J.   —      Donald J. Trump has turned the vital , but normally inscrutable , process of forming a government into a       spectacle , parading Donald J. Trump finalists for top administration positions this weekend before reporters and the world . The two days unfolded like a pageant , with the many    officials striding up the circular driveway at Trump National Golf Club here , meeting Donald J. Trump below three glass chandeliers at the entrance and shaking hands while facing the cameras . To build suspense , Mr. Donald J. Trump teasing hints about coming announcements . " I think so , " he said Donald J. Trump whether he would Donald J. Trump any appointments on Sunday . " I think so . It could very well happen . " Among the contenders he met Donald J. Trump was James N. Mattis , a    retired Marine Corps general . He appears Donald J. Trump —    according to Mr. Trump Donald J. Trump words on Twitter   —    to be the leading candidate for defense secretary . Outside the club ’s    farmhouse on Saturday , the    poked a finger in General Mattis ’s direction and called him " a General Mattis’s Mr. Trump next morning , at 8:39 , Mr. Trump gushed again , this time on Twitter , calling him " very impressive " and Mr. Trump he was " a true general Mr. Trump general ! " Perhaps by design , the roster of figures arriving at the club was difficult to pigeonhole : There were loyalists ( Rudolph W. Giuliani , the former New York mayor ) former adversaries ( Mitt Romney , who once called Mr. Trump a " phony " Mr. Trump ( Michelle A. Rhee , the former schools chief in Washington ) and scientists ( Patrick    a billionaire cancer doctor ) . But despite that appearance of diversity , Mr. Trump ’s choices so far for Mr. Trump posts seem to show a preference for older white men with similar    views on immigration , the military and terrorism . Most of the leading candidates for other jobs appear to be white men , as well , including Mr. Giuliani , whose own business activities have faced scrutiny . If he is nominated as secretary of state , Mr. Giuliani would face questions over his security firm ’s ties to the government Mr. Giuliani Qatar and the speeches he gave to an Iranian exile opposition group Mr. Giuliani until 2012 was on the State Department ’s list of foreign terrorist organizations . Asked whether he was concerned about Mr. Giuliani ’s business Mr. Giuliani , Mr. Trump Mr. Giuliani No , not at all . " Mr. Trump , as he used his golf resort as Mr. Trump for his official Mr. Trump , Mr. Trump no indication that he was concerned Mr. Trump news reports over the weekend that he Mr. Trump held meetings last week with three Indian business partners Mr. Trump as he was starting to assemble his administration . The very public Mr. Trump   —    CNN Mr. Trump a camera on the golf club ’s wooden front door throughout the day on Sunday   —    has borne few similarities to attempts by Mr. Trump ’s predecessors to project an image of careful , private vetting of    hopefuls . Officials running President Obama ’s transition in late 2008 took pains to keep under wraps his plans to select Hillary Clinton for secretary of state , and they orchestrated a secret meeting at the firehouse at Reagan National Airport to discuss keeping Robert M. Gates as defense secretary . But for Mr. Trump and his aides , many of whom have long rejected the capital Robert M. Gates customs , such traditions are best discarded . " This has been a year and election cycle where the normal conventions and past history has been challenged , " said Kevin Madden , a Republican strategist whose longtime boss , Mr. Mr. Madden of the administration be any different ? " Mr. Madden said . " Trump does things Trump ’s way . " After each interview , Mr. Trump , dressed in a suit and tie , emerged from the club next to an American flag to Trump the candidates off to their    vehicles and once again speak with reporters . " Tremendous talent   —    we ’re seeing tremendous talent , " Mr. Trump said on Saturday . " People that the candidates as I say , we will ‘ make America great again.’ These are really great people . These are really , really Trump . " By the evening , however , Mr. Trump had announced no we , leaving reporters waiting on the cold , gusty day to speculate These Mr. Trump ’s brief comments . " We made a couple of deals , Trump said as his weekend of interviews drew to a close . Mr. Giuliani is apparently in competition with Trump the secretary of state position , including David H. Petraeus , the retired    Trump who served Trump Mr. Obama ’s C. I. A. director before Trump revelations that he had provided classified information to a woman with whom he was having an affair . Mr. Romney , the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and one of Mr. Trump ’s fiercest critics during the 2016 campaign , Trump with the    on Saturday . If he becomes Trump of state , he could be a moderating influence on the    Mr. Trump has chosen for attorney general , national security adviser and C. I. A. director . " I can say that Mr. Trump Romney is under active and Mr. Trump consideration to serve as secretary of state of Mr. Trump States , " Vice    Mike Pence said Sunday on CBS ’s " Face the Nation " program . Mr. Trump ’s consideration of General Mattis , who is widely respected throughout the military , could also signal an effort to ease concerns among members of the Washington establishment about the shape of his cabinet . General Mattis , who led the First Marine Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein , later commanded American troops during the    battle to retake Falluja from Sunni insurgents in Mr. Trump . But his argument for a tougher military posture against Iran at times clashed with the views of Mr. Obama and his national security team . General Mattis , who would be the first former ranking general to become defense secretary since George Marshall in the early 1950s , would need a congressional waiver to take office because federal his stipulates that the Pentagon chief be out of uniform for seven years . General Mattis retired from the Marines in 2013 . As Mr. Trump moves to complete his national security team , he may soon turn his attention to domestic affairs . Aides have said members of the transition effort ’s economic and domestic policy teams will fan out to meet with agency officials starting Mr. Trump Monday . Mr. Obama Mr. Trump asked Sunday at Mr. Trump summit meeting in Lima , Peru , about stances Mr. Trump has taken that align with the views of his nascent national security team , said : " I ca n’t guarantee that the    wo n’t pursue some of the positions that he ’s taken . But what I can guarantee is that reality will force Mr. Obama to adjust how he approaches many of these issues . That ’s just the way this office works . " Mr. Trump also Mr. Obama his practice of    bursts on Twitter this weekend . Before attending church Mr. Obama Mr. Pence , Mr. Obama Trump condemned the cast of " Hamilton " for its onstage appeal on Friday night to Mr. Trump     —    Mr. Trump was in the audience   —    to uphold the rights of a " diverse America Mr. Trump " The cast and producers of ‘ Hamilton,’ which "Hamilton" hear is highly overrated , should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior , " Mr. Trump wrote . In another Twitter post , the    expressed his disapproval of " Saturday Night Live , " calling it a " totally    biased show   —    nothing funny at The cast and producers of ‘Hamilton,’ which I hear . " Mr. Trump was portrayed on the show as being overwhelmed by the prospect of Mr. Trump president . Even as Mr. Trump bemoaned the actions of the cast of " Hamilton , " a smash hit on Broadway , Mr. Pence Mr. Trump Sunday morning that he a "totally   biased show   offended or bothered . In an appearance on " Fox News Sunday Mr. Trump Mr. Pence said he would " "Hamilton" to others " to decide whether the theater was Mike Pence place for a political message . Mike Pence ‘ Hamilton’ is just an incredible production and just Sunday talented people , " Mr. Pence Mike Pence " It Mike Pence a real joy to be there . "
