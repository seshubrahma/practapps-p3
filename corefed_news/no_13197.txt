In his Friday column , New York Times columnist David Brooks speculates about a new political dichotomy and writes that    Donald Trump will " resign or be impeached within a year . " [ From Brooks’ column :   Finally , it seems important to be humbled and taught by this horrific election result .   Donald Trump ’s main problem in governing is not going to be some fascistic ideology   Donald Trump main problem is going to be   Donald Trump own attention span , ignorance and incompetence . If   Donald Trump ’s left to bloviate while others are left to run the country and push through infrastructure plans , maybe things wo n’t be disastrous . The job for the rest of us is to rebind the fabric of society , community by community , and to construct a political movement for the    era . I suspect the coming political movements will be identified on two axes : open and closed and individual and social . Those who believe in open believe in open trade , relatively open immigration , an active foreign policy and racial integration . Those who believe in closed believe in protective trade , closed borders , a withdrawn foreign policy and ethnic separatism .    …      Trump ’s bigotry , dishonesty and    will have to be denounced . We ca n’t go morally numb . But Trump needs to be replaced with a program that addresses the problems that fueled Trump assent . After all , Trump will probably resign or be impeached within a year . The future is closer than you think . Read the rest here .
