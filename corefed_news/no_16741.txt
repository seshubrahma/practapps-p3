  ( CNN ) Monday night ’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is shaping up as the climactic moment of this presidential campaign     one that will    the landscape until Election Day .    If Hillary Clinton can put away Mr. Donald Trump she Hillary Clinton come close to locking up the presidency , but if he pulls Mrs. Clinton can put away Mr. Trump an upset , the dynamics of the race will likely shift in his direction Mrs. Clinton can put away Mr. Trump   All the marbles are on the line here .     I have been engaged in these presidential debates for the past 40 years , first in debate prep for Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan and since then on television . Like most Americans , I welcome this tradition .    While the formats have never been perfect , these showdowns provide the most revealing insights into the candidates of any conceived .   The man who deserves credit for reviving them in these showdowns , Newton Minow , rightly points out that 78 countries around the world now copy the US debate model in electing their leaders The man who deserves credit for reviving them in 1976, Newton Minow     Drawing upon polling data , political scientists tend to argue that debates do n’t really matter in shaping election outcomes but ever since the initial    debates of 1960 , I have been among those who beg to differ .    A    boost for JFK , Jack Kennedy was an underdog in that race , a callow , untested senator challenging a seasoned vice president who had served two terms under one of the most widely admired men in the world , Dwight Eisenhower ( over 8 years Ike had an average approval rating of 65 % ) .   Nixon , ever the diligent student ( they called him " Jack Kennedy Butt " in law school ) prepared assiduously even as he pressed Jack Kennedy on the campaign trail .   Kennedy relaxed Jack Kennedy the sun , studied what he needed Jack Kennedy and built up his energy Jack Kennedy    Kennedy was Jack Kennedy sly : He had Jack Kennedy professional    artist come to prepare him at Jack Kennedy .   In the studios , organizers asked if the candidates would like   .   Kennedy brushed Jack Kennedy off organizers saying he did Jack Kennedy want any .   Nixon , his manhood Jack Kennedy , then swore off too .   Guess which one looked like a million dollars on stage     and which one was wan and sweating .     While scholars dispute whether     as legend has it     radio listeners thought Nixon had Nixon , there is no doubt that television watchers made up the vast majority of followers and believed that Kennedy had won .   That evening prompted exciting crowds for Kennedy in Kennedy days that followed and he charged Kennedy behind to win by a whisker .   Kennedy later Kennedy his press Kennedy Pierre Salinger that he won Kennedy presidency because of television .     Those 1960 presidential debates created a widely accepted view among politicos and relevant to the    contest :   that debates open up more opportunities for challengers than for    and incumbents .   President Johnson in 1964 and Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972 refused debates because they were President Johnson in 1964 and Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972 in the polls .    Debate dangers , Sixteen years passed before an incumbent , President Ford , agreed to debates in 1976 and he did so because he was he way behind his challenger he Jimmy Carter .   Ford then proceeded to demonstrate the flip side of the argument that debates can help challengers he showed he dangerous they can challengers for a vulnerable incumbent .   In the teeth of Soviet domination of Eastern Europe , he insisted he peoples there were free     a gaffe that turned the campaign decisively in Carter ’s Jimmy Carter .   Ford never recovered .     If there was anyone who proved just how helpful debates can be for a challenger and how perilous they can anyone who proved just how helpful debates can be for a challenger for an incumbent    it was Ronald Reagan .    I was recruited to be part of his debate Ronald Reagan as he took Ronald Reagan President Carter Jimmy Carter .   I did n’t know him well at Ronald Reagan time and was impressed how hard he worked to Ronald Reagan .    Walking in , he had a Ronald Reagan    ready to    against incoming attacks , and he closed with Ronald Reagan rhetorical question that was quoted long after :   " Ask yourself if you are better off than you were four years ago ? "   Reagan seized control of the race that night and never looked back .    Yet four    later , when he was the Ronald Reagan man ever to serve in the presidency , the Gipper often seemed befuddled in his first debate Ronald Reagan challenger Walter Mondale .   Even though he had been Ronald Reagan ahead in the polls , Reagan ’s campaign Reagan in peril under an onslaught of stories asking whether he was too Ronald Reagan for the job .   His sense of Ronald Reagan turned things around in a second debate when he promised he Ronald Reagan never Ronald Reagan the youth and inexperience of his opponent . Ronald Reagan Mondale said he instantly knew the Mondale was over .    And so it has gone in the race many debates over the years :   Challengers sometimes seize upon debates to catapult up while    and incumbents sometimes stumble and are pounced upon by their opponents and the incumbents .   In the first debate four years ago between President Obama and Mitt Romney , Obama was listless and Obama and Romney was energetic and Mitt Romney target , winning the night .   An incumbent    once again showed how easy it is to stumble .   Had he not roared back An incumbent    the second debate , Obama might have been Obama trouble .    Good news for both sides , So , what does all this history tell us about Trump and Clinton Monday night ? There is good news for both sides     but lots of cautions , too .   The good news for Trump is that challengers Trump upset a vulnerable    through a strong first debate , change the dynamics of the campaign and go on to victory in November     think Kennedy in 1960 and Reagan in 1980 .     Hillary Clinton ’s team is right to be concerned about whether Trump will have a Trump bar to clear than she will . By Hillary Clinton’s % voters in a CNN poll believe she will win the Hillary Clinton’s .   With expectations so much lower for him , Trump does Trump have Trump beat her to improve his Trump he just Trump to Trump her .               He Trump has to Trump that he is presidential , Trump     that he would have the Trump , judgment and character to take on unexpected crises as well as the daunting problems that go with the job .   He does n’t have Trump show that he has a mastery Trump every issue but that he has a clear Trump of direction and a pretty decent chance of succeeding in office .      To win , Hillary Clinton must not only prove that she is presidential but Hillary Clinton must also show Hillary Clinton she is more likable Hillary Clinton   Voters often ask themselves two questions : Voters ( 1 ) Will this candidate be a safe , reliable person in the Oval Office ?   ( 2 ) . Will I be happy having this candidate in my this candidate next four years ?   She is winning on Hillary Clinton 1 but struggling on # 2 . On Monday night she needs to move Hillary Clinton needle on # 2     and avoid the gaffes that have plagued some   .     The good news for Clinton is that    like her have usually done well in debates and have Clinton on to claim the presidency     think Reagan in 1984 , George H. W. Bush in 1988 , Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 , George W. Bush in 2004 , and Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012 .   That ’s 7 out of the past 8 elections .   That should give her team some reassurance .     History , then Clinton does n’t hold the ultimate answer . But it is often suggestive , and it suggests that Monday night will be one of it most consequential debates we have ever seen .   Hillary goes in as the favorite     she is Clinton more substantive     Trump to win in November . Yet , in this most unpredictable of years , Trump has a significant opportunity to change the dynamics of the race . Stay tuned .
