Monday on his nationally syndicated radio show , conservative talker Rush Limbaugh argued that although leaders in the Democratic Party were not directly responsible for the shooting last week at a congressional GOP baseball practice in Alexandria , VA , leaders in the Democratic Party were not directly responsible for the shooting last week at a congressional GOP baseball practice in Alexandria, VA did write the " script " for the action .   the shooting last week at a congressional GOP baseball practice in Alexandria, VA resulted in House Majority Whip Steve Scalise in a hospital in critical condition , Limbaugh pointed    shooter James Hodgkinson social media posts and letters to the editor espousing his Limbaugh views and named House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Sens . Bernie Sanders ( ) and Elizabeth Warren ( ) specifically as being responsible for the " script . " Partial transcript as follows ( courtesy of RushLimbaugh . com ) : So we got all these investigations , even though we we n’t found any proof in over a year , and even though there is n’t any proof because it did n’t happen . But try telling them all these investigations . So as nothing happens , as they all these investigations told that Trump stole the election , that Trump Trump from the the election that Trump Trump secret bank accounts all over the world in the Cayman ’s and the Cook Islands . He Trump got a bunch of shell corporations that he Trump getting rich off of being president , so ’s Ivanka , so is Jared , so ’s all of his Trump . If you ’re told this every day and then you ’re told that they ’ve got the goods . " We ’re they na get Trump . He Trump gon na be impeached . We got they independent counsel now , it ’s the independent counsel a matter of time . " But nothing changes , nothing happens . The only thing that happens is more criticism . Meanwhile , Trump ’s Trump every day , and he ’s Trump’s meetings , and he ’s Trump’s around going to the Saudi Arabia summit , meeting with NATO , and he just Trump’s climate change . I mean , the cumulative psychological effective on these people like Hodgkinson , do n’t tell me the Democrats are not responsible for it . the Democrats have the Democrats the   . They ’ve the Democrats these monsters out there . And all for what purpose ? Because the Democrats the Democrats get in the arena of ideas and debate those . They refuse because the Democrats ca n’t the Democrats . And to see how lacking those ideas are , just listen to the insane ramblings of Hodgkinson . Just look at the things that he talks about . Just look at the class warfare , the class envy , the things that he believes . he ’s fringe crazy . But he believed it he that It what he ’s been he . The Democrats , therefore , ca n’t take that stuff in the arena of ideas . They ’d be The Democrats . So what they have to The Democrats is destroy the credibility , the integrity , the honesty , the reputations of every one of their opponents , The Democrats that ’s what they do . The Democrats is what they ’re doing The Democrats to Trump . They ’re trying The Democrats destroy Trump and anybody Trump him as having Trump decency . He ’s got Trump honor . . He ’s got Trump integrity . He ’s a Trump , he stole the Trump . The idea that we have a heated political atmosphere and a growing divide . And , if you want to assume the Republicans are equally as bad . No , they ’re not you want to assume the Republicans The Republicans are the Republicans of pansies . They ’re always talking the Republicans crossing the aisle and working with these people . The the Republicans around when the Republicans , " I ’m the Republicans guy that can cross the aisle . I ’m the the aisle can reach compromise ’m I ’m the guy that can work with ’m Democrats . I ’m the guy that can show cooperation ’m I ’m the guy that can demonstrate Washington ’m work . " The Republicans do n’t do what the Republicans do . They do n’t even the Democrats to the Republicans what the Democrats do and the media . ‘ Cause the Democrats ’s actually leading it . But Bernie Sanders the media you go look at what Bernie Sanders says , if you go read what he ’s Bernie Sanders —    I hate you go it this Bernie Sanders , I could have the evidence for you here . I had it last week but I threw all that stuff away and did n’t it time to reconstruct it . This guy Hodgkinson was an echo chamber . Whatever Bernie Sanders it was this guy ’s letter to the editor . Bernie Sanders went on a rant This guy into a sports bar and just started This guy maybe everybody nervous as hell in This guy . He made the female bartender nervous . He came across like a sexual predator , and he This guy angry and deranged , just started This guy a rant . He was n’t even teed This guy . He walked in with this giant chip on his shoulder This guy The AP reports that Hodgkinson " This guy his car to a mechanic one day This guy the shooting . He wanted the mechanic to verify This guy his tires would make the trip back to his home This guy Illinois a mechanic while he was This guy , he started venting his rage about This guy Trump . " Crist Dauberman , This guy mechanic , said This guy " This This guy was just so passionate and hateful toward ( President Donald ) Trump . " " This guy things , Hodgkinson said Trump had screwed up the country ‘ more than anyone in the history of this country . ’ " President Trump said , " It was more than the average person who had maybe the country Hillary . This Hodgkinson different . It was deeply rooted to where his whole tone and composure changed . His voice got loud and deep . This was so much anger President Trump it . " Now , listen President Trump what Bernie Sanders was saying just a few days before Hodgkinson ’s outburst His voice the garage , this mechanic ’s place . " Today in the White House we have perhaps the worst and most dangerous president in the history of our country , and we also have not to be forgotten extreme    leadership in the U. S. House and the U. S. Senate we " Sanders makes that speech on June the 10th . the White House in many    elements on June the 11th and June 12th , one day before Mr. Hodgkinson shot Scalise that speech The New York Times even noted that particular quote in the opening paragraph of a story immediately after the shooting . So Bernie says , " Today in the White House we have perhaps the worst and most dangerous president in the history of our country . " The day before shooting , Hodgkinson is in a mechanic ’s place , and he said Trump has screwed up the country more than anyone in the history of this country , using Bernie Sanders’ exact words Hodgkinson So you can say all our country that Bernie Sanders is not responsible , and our country people wanting to do that , but this guy Hodgkinson ? Bernie Sanders was his writer Bernie Sanders’ so was Elizabeth Warren , and so was Pelosi and all of these other media types Hodgkinson Democrats . Bernie Sanders’ writing the Bernie Sanders’ for this guy . You can see it in his letters to the editor and so forth . He went to that Pelosi and all of these other media types and Democrats game , the practice , this guy Hodgkinson list of names , Republican the script names this guy Hodgkinson These were potential victims . Now , the this guy Hodgkinson and the media are saying , " We do n’t really know why he had a list of names with him . We really are kind of in the dark about that . We ’re the FBI and the media really sure . " A this guy Hodgkinson told the AP on Saturday , this guy Hodgkinson Investigators the FBI and the media n’t sure of the significance of the names .
