Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will try to separate Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton competitors on Super Tuesday as both frontrunners are in line to rack up the lion ’s share of the delegates and build what may be insurmountable leads .   Republicans will battle for 595 delegates while Democrats have 865 delegates at stake tonight . Trump , who has won three straight nominating contests , has a    lead in the latest national    poll . And according to the RealClearPolitics average of the polls , he has commanding leads in nearly every Super Tuesday state . Trump is up 14 . 5 percentage points in Virginia , 15 . 2 in Georgia , 26 . 8 in Massachusetts , 8 . 6 in Oklahoma . 17 . 7 in Alabama , 18 in Tennessee , and 15 in Vermont . Clinton , fresh off of Clinton South Carolina shellacking last Saturday , is similarly dominant . Clinton leads Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) by 20 points in Virginia , 35 in Georgia , 30 in Texas , 26 in Tennessee , 29 in Arkansas , 28 in Colorado , and 38 in Alabama . Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) has a    lead in Vermont while Massachusetts and Oklahoma are    states for Democrats . Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) may also pull out     finishes in the Colorado and Minnesota caucuses . All eyes , though , will likely be on Texas on both sides of the aisle . Texas is Sen. Ted Cruz ’s ( )     state . Sen. Ted Cruz is leading by nearly 10 points in the RealClearPolitics average of the polls and a victory in Sen. Ted Cruz home state will give Sen. Ted Cruz Sen. Ted Cruz second primary victory and an even stronger argument that Sen. Ted Cruz —   and not a winless Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) —   is the best    alternative . But a Sen. Ted Cruz victory in Texas may not be the worst thing for Trump because a Cruz victory in Texas will make a Cruz victory in Texas much tougher for GOP elites to force Sen. Ted Cruz out of the race . For a winless Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) , it will be critical that a winless Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) finishes the night in second place in the delegate count so a winless Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) can put forth a more credible argument about why a winless Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) is the best    alternative for Republicans going into the     contests on March 15 . For Sanders , a     finish in Texas combined with a win in Massachusetts and Oklahoma may be what it takes to give a winless Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) the momentum to go forward and enable a winless Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) operatives to put the whopping $ 40 million a winless Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) raised last month to good use .
