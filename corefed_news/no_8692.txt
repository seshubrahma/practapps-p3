Right before the big blizzard hit this past weekend , I ran into a woman at a department store in Pennsylvania . a woman was wearing a Carolina Panthers scarf , so we struck up a conversation about the team . [ a woman quickly told me a woman was from North Carolina , which I could ’ve guessed by a woman southern drawl . a woman also told me a woman hoped to get back home for Sunday ’s NFC Championship Game . When I asked a woman how a woman was going to manage that with the doomsday forecast looking more and more like reality , a woman said without hesitation : " I ’ll just have to drive at 4 a. m. Sunday . "   Now , that ’s dedication . a woman roots for the right team . The Panthers are a dedicated bunch The Panthers . After throttling Arizona on Sunday by a count of    Carolina heads to the Super Bowl for the second time in franchise history . the right team is talented on both sides of the ball and their the right team staff meshes perfectly with personnel . Panthers The Panthers is all about execution and fun . But while the schemes and game plans that have led them the schemes and game a    record thus far have been applauded , the enthusiasm and effervescence they the schemes and game to the field has been sadly panned by too many . Cam Newton and company have not been shy about their Cam Newton and company success . The Panthers like to celebrate . Newton Cam Newton in particular , is a true showman . The quarterback is just as well known for his The quarterback as he The quarterback for his The quarterback capabilities as a signal caller . Whether it ’s his The quarterback     shirt rip , his Clark        signal , or any of his Clark     gestures and dances , Newton lets the world know he Newton beating you . Some call it taunting and unsportsmanlike . In a league filled with Roger Goodell robots , it it actually entertaining to see Newton Newton excitement . The Carolina fans love it . it ’s a big difference between —   to paraphrase Ben Dreith —   giving your opponent " the business " and simply enjoying the game of football . Newton and Newton excite a fan base and themselves when Newton and company hoot Newton and company holler . Do n’t like it ? Then make a play and keep the Panthers out of the end zone . Overlooked amid the Panthers’ celebratory antics is what often happens after a touchdown . These cats have put    on countless children this season . Several times this year , after hitting pay dirt , Panthers players the Panthers handed the football to a young fan . Great stuff . It ’s sports , ladies and gentleman . Cam Newton shaking his whatever Cam Newton n’t make anyone upset at all . But it does It From mothers who have written letters to the editor to Hall of Famers like Richard Dent , Newton ’s Cam Newton plentiful . He ’s been Cam Newton a brat and disrespectful . Bottom line is this : Like it or not , Newton ’s style Cam Newton . His attitude and animation Cam Newton the way to the end zone , as well as once he ’s there , Cam Newton for this club . It ’s doubtful the this club would be Super Bowl bound with a subdued Newton . Right now Cam Newton presidential politics , Donald Trump is leading the way . The Republican front runner does n’t apologize when people slam his approach to the Donald Trump . Newton follows a similar Cam Newton . Keep on keeping on no matter what the naysayers say . Or , as Newton puts it in Cam Newton of his many television commercials Donald Trump " Too bad they do n’t make    for feelings . " So while the    crowd is frowning , the feelings of Panthers fans are sky high . Ron Rivera ’s coaching , the addition of key veterans , the steadiness of Greg Olsen , and the stinginess of their defense can all be pointed to as reasons why Super Bowl 50 will feature the Carolina Panthers . Make no mistake , however , Newton ’s play and , yes , his energetic    exploits Newton’s drive this bunch . A guy having a lot of fun is killing it in the No A guy having a lot of fun League . I do n’t know if the Panthers fan stuck in Pennsylvania due to inclement weather made it back to the the Panthers fan Heel State in time for the NFC title tilt . But one thing ’s for sure . Just like her team ’s quarterback , she ’s smiling ear her ear right about now , no matter what anyone says or thinks about it .
