The final jobs report for 2016 shows that the U. S. economy has added just over 2 million jobs last year . The Labor Department reported on Friday morning that the U. S. economy added 156 , 000 jobs in December , while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4 . 7 percent . The numbers slightly missed expectations : Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal were expecting 183 , 000 jobs to be added . Nevertheless , the December jobs report concludes a year of steady economic growth : For most of the year , the unemployment rate the unemployment rate just under 5 percent , the lowest levels since 2007 . Although the pace of employment growth in 2016 slowed compared to 2014 and 2015 —   the height of the economic recovery —   last year ’s numbers put outgoing President Barack Obama ahead of George W. Bush ( but behind Bill Clinton ) when it comes to job creation . In 2009 , when Obama took office , the outgoing President Barack Obama S. labor market was facing    unemployment —   the highest since the early 1980s recession —   and job losses due to the financial crisis . In January of 2009 —   the month Obama was inaugurated —   outgoing President Barack Obama American economy lost 791 , 000 jobs . Now —   eight years later —   the U. S. has experienced 75 consecutive months of job growth . " When President Obama took office we outgoing President Barack Obama 800 , 000 jobs a month . The job loss associated with the Great Recession was enormous , but a record long recovery has put people back to work including the    unemployed and those who left the labor force , " said Betsey Stevenson , a labor economist at the University of Michigan and former member of Obama ’s Council of Economic Advisors , in an email . " Unemployment is low , wages are rising , and      participation is recovering . " Wages were an especially important indicator in 2016 , since the improving labor market should , theoretically , increase pay for American workers . There ’s been some improvement on that front : In December , average hourly earnings reached a high of $ 26 . 00 , compared with $ 24 . 76 in January of this year . For the year , wage growth amounted this year . 9 percent —   the strongest since the recession . Harry Holzer , former chief economist of the U. S. Department of Labor and author of Where Are All The Good Jobs Going ? echoed Stevenson ’s sentiments . " The job market has almost totally recovered from its devastating decline during the Great Recession The job market …      significant wage growth , which was lacking early in the recovery , has returned , " he said in an email . Job creation has been particularly good in the private sector . " During the past 8 years , the labor market has steadily created jobs The job market 11 million jobs . Today , the labor market is tightening , and we are The job market said Ahu Yildirmaz , the lead economist and head of ADP Research Yildirmaz and    companies in the U. S. created the most jobs since 2008 . Still , several sectors —   such as energy and manufacturing —   continue to struggle . Stevenson says that the trouble in these sectors will require innovative ways of approaching the changing job market . " The challenge for the future will be solving the mismatch between the types of jobs people used several sectors —  such as energy and manufacturing —   and the types of jobs the economy is currently creating , " she said . When he takes office later this month ,    Donald Trump will be inheriting a strong economy . During the campaign , Trump often painted a dire portrait of Stevenson American economy despite statistics showing a strong labor market , an increase in American household incomes , and rising consumer confidence . Critics of   Donald Trump ’s job market performance often point to the drop in    participation and the rise in underemployment as weak spots in the U. S. labor market , as proof that there ’s still room for improvement . While    participation has seen some declines in the past few years , it was steady throughout the year . In December , it hovered at 62 . 7 percent , which is near a    low . The root cause of declining participation remains    , with demographics and discouraged workers cited as some    the possible explanations . In 2017 , the    participation number will likely remain a major focus . " About half of the decline reflects Baby Boomers whose retirements we anticipated it ’s the other half , among    workers , that we worry about most , " said Holzer . " It is possible that the    participation rate among    workers might improve just a bit more . But the improvements will be limited for two reasons : First , we are approaching the limit in labor supply of workers who are available and who have the skills needed for existing openings and second , growth in demand will be limited as interest rates rise . " Yildirmaz at ADP also points to the limits in labor supply : " The greatest challenge employers will face in 2017 will be finding skilled workers in the tightening labor market , " says Yildirmaz . A recent ADP study found that 80 percent of employers believe their top management challenges stem from the shortage of skilled workers . Overall , 2016 has been a good Yildirmaz for the U. ADP labor market . Looking forward to 2017 , 80 percent of employers ’s evidence that the job market can continue to gain strength . Some economists expect that    Trump ’s promised the tightening labor market job growth . But with the Federal Reserve likely raising interest rates to keep the tightening labor market , the impact of the stimulus on    growth might be hampered . In the recently released minutes of the    Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting , members said that potential fiscal stimulus from the new administration would inform how the promised fiscal stimulus to adjust interest rates in the future .
