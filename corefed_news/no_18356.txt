How    it’ ’s possible that he’ ’s pitching shares in a risky startup on TV    is more complicated . Even though the IPO is " qualified " by the    Securities and Exchange Commission , the aggressive way YayYo    shares are being marketed could be problematic , experts say ,       since the pitch is to     investors . ’ ’   ’ ’    The    a tiny startup with no working product , few    staffers    but a big marketing budget .

Experts say the implication that YayYo could become bigger       Uber is audacious enough YayYo attract legal and regulatory    scrutiny . ’ ’    About 700 people have already invested ,    says , with    individual investments ranging from a    $ 8 share    to    $ 100 , 000 . ’ ’      says repeatedly that the ads target only professional ,    savvy investors who watch    channels like Fox    Business and CNBC during the day . ’ "    But those networks also attract many hobby investors and    retirees , and the ad ’s own script specifically speaks to      investors . " ’    " With these new SEC rules , it makes it possible for the little    guy like these new SEC rules or these new SEC rules to buy into an IPO previously unavailable , "    O’’Hurley tells TV viewers . ’ ’    Those new SEC rules are something called " Regulation A+ these new SEC rules was approved in March 2015 as Regulation A+    startups like YayYo    to essentially crowdsource investment in a " .

" ’    And as part of the rules , there are fewer requirements and as long as    regulations for companies like these new SEC rules if it were to as long as    a      IPO . ’ ’    There are actually two kinds of Regulation A+ offerings . In Tier    1 , a company can raise up to $ 20 million from investors in a    year . Importantly , Tier 1 is regulated more by individual states    than the SEC . Tier 2 offerings , like YayYo , are larger   —    raising    up to $ 50 million in a year   —    and though both require an SEC    review , the latter offerings are not subject to review by the    states . ’ "    To the public , that these offerings are submitted to the the SEC might imply that it ’s a pretty good bet .
