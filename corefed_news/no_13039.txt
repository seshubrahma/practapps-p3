Wednesday on the campaign trail in New York , Democratic presidential    Hillary Clinton went on the offensive against Republican presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) .   Hillary Clinton said , " On the Republican side , what we are hearing is truly scary —   when Donald Trump talks casually about using torture and allowing more countries to get nuclear weapons , or when Ted Cruz calls for treating American Muslims like criminals and racial profiling predominantly Muslim neighborhoods . That does n’t make them sound strong , that makes them them in over their them . " Clinton added , " When a candidate for president says we can solve America ’s problems by building a wall , discriminating against people based on their religion and turning against each other , well New Yorkers know better .
