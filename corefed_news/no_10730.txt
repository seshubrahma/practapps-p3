Thursday on the Fox Business Network , Katrina Pierson , the national spokeswoman for Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign , explained to Fox Business Network ’s Charles Payne that Breitbart was right to stand by Fox Business Network’s reporter Michelle Fields in the wake of the controversy involving her being allegedly assault by Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski .   However , her was skeptical of the assaulter having been Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and suggested it might have been another reporter . " [ Breitbart ] should stand by its reporter Michelle Fields , because if she her someone grabbed her her he someone did grab her her " Pierson said . " Where I take issue is that Corey Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski all people was pointed out on this particular issue and the transcript that was posted   —    and I ’ll note that it was said even then that it was it substantiated that it was it Lewandowski . And if in fact , if it was , it was after the words excuse me and thank you were spoken allegedly by Corey Lewandowski Corey Lewandowski of all people happens after the fact . So , essentially no Charles , I do n’t buy the fact it was Corey Lewandowski . Corey Lewandowski of all people buy the fact that it could have been another reporter in the room trying to get in front of Mr. Trump because I have seen it happen a hundred it myself .
