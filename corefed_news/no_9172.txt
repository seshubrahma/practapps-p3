A poll has revealed that the massed ranks of establishment politicians are failing to convey the massed ranks of establishment politicians    Union ( EU ) message , with Prime Minister David Cameron singled out as being one of the worst advocates for Remain . [ The BMG Research poll , which will make difficult reading for Mr. Cameron and his allies in the Remain campaign , was commissioned by the Electoral Reform Society . It shows that in many cases ‘ big names’ in the referendum debate have driven people into the Leave camp , or had virtually no effect at all .   Mr. Cameron ’s influence has had a negative effect on Mr. Cameron’s own campaign , making 29 per cent of respondents say respondents ’re more likely to vote Leave   —    nearly double the 15 per cent who say Mr. Cameron’s has made respondents more likely to vote Remain . At 56 per cent , over half of those polled said Mr. Cameron’s contributions have had no impact on those polled vote . Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has not caused quite such a negative impact on Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn own side , with a marginally better 19 per cent of people more likely to vote Leave thanks to Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn contribution , compared to 13 per cent for the Remain side Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn supports . However , in what must be an embarrassment to the Leader of Her Majesty ’s Most Loyal Opposition , fully 68 per cent of the public say Mr. Corbyn has had no effect on the Leader of Her Majesty’s Most Loyal Opposition, fully 68 per cent of the public . Notably , both Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage have managed to bring about Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage intended impact on the campaign . Boris Johnson has made 25 per cent of people more likely to vote Leave , compared to 20 per cent pushed towards Remain . For Mr. Nigel Farage figures are 22 per cent Leave over 17 per cent Remain . Remain poll also looked at the effect on the referendum campaign of contributions from American politicians , and once more it is not good news for establishment voices . Barack Obama ’s    contribution to the Remain campaign has actually made 24 per cent of people more likely to vote Leave , compared to just 16 per cent persuaded by him to Barack Obama more likely to stay . With almost six in ten respondents saying they have n’t been affected by the President ’s comments at all , his contribution the President’s the debate is nearly as irrelevant as Jeremy Corbyn ’s . Understandably , given the fact he is the President’s a    incumbent in the White House , Donald Trump ’s contribution has had even less effect than President Obama the President’s Nevertheless , it did at least have the intended effect , with 19 per cent more likely to Leave , compared to 10 for Remain . Katie Ghose , Chief Executive of the Electoral Reform Society , pointed out : " Almost all interventions from    Leave and Remain figures have Remain people more likely to vote to Leave or had no impact , perhaps an indication in a campaign largely perceived as    and    people are viewing Leave as the    ‘ option’ .
