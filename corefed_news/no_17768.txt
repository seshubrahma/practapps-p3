’   ’ ’    Do n’t worry about Donald Trump   —    Donald Trump  —    Republican supporters have    been whispering to Never Trumpers like Donald Trump  —    for months . Donald Trump  —    does n’t    really mean all of Donald Trump  —    campaign rhetoric . ’ ’    In fact , Donald Trump  —    does n’t have much interest in policy at all , they    said . ’ ’    Donald Trump  —    ’ll delegate governing to Mike Pence , Reince Priebus , and Paul    Ryan while Ryan plays a lot of golf . You ’ll see that there ’s    nothing to be scared of . ’ ’    After just one week in office   —    arguably the worst opening since       premiered in 2002   —    Trump has exposed such assurances for what    Trump are : the kind of lies that supposedly smart people tell    supposedly smart people to feel better about a catastrophe supposedly smart people know in supposedly smart people    bones is looming . ’ ’    Trump ’s first seven days began on Jan. 20 , when he Trump delivered the bleakest and most divisive   in U. S.    history , presenting a dystopian picture of the America a land    of " carnage " that he Trump on America ’s trade partners and    disloyal American elites . It sounded just like one of his Trump campaign rally speeches   —    not the kind of elevated addresses that    we have gotten used to from his Trump , Democratic and    Republican alike . ’ ’    Seven days later , on Jan. 27 , the first week concluded with the    release of an    decree temporarily barring our doors to    refugees from all over the world and passport holders from seven    Muslim countries selected seemingly at random . ’ ’    This    and badly implemented order caused chaos at U. S.    airports with border agents not knowing whom they were U. S.   airports with border agents    to admit and federal judges stepping in to prevent the    implementation of important parts of this draconian diktat until    their constitutionality U. S.   airports with border agents be litigated . ’ ’    The ostensible justification for this move was to protect us from    terrorists , but no terrorists from any of the seven banned Muslim    countries   —    Iraq , Syria , Iran , Sudan , Libya , Somalia , and Yemen   —      have ever killed anyone in America . ’ ’   ’ ’    It is hard to disagree with Benjamin Wittes ’s   on the Lawfare blog    that Trump is " elevating the symbolic politics of bashing Islam    over any actual security interest . " ’ ’    In between these lowlights , the nation America to risible    claims from the    president that the media had lied    about the size of his   and    he    would    won the popular vote were it not for the " millions " of    ballots cast illegally . ’ ’    To support the latter assertion , for which there is no actual    evidence , Trump alternatively cited a   relayed to    him by a Trump of the German golfer Bernhard Langer ( who is not    a U. S. citizen ) and a   which no one has seen ,    supposedly conducted    a conspiracy theorist Phillips    Phillips has also   that it was Barack    Obama ’s Department of Homeland Security , not the Russian    intelligence services , that hacked the election and that " The UN    is global fascism . " ’ ’   ’ ’       ’ ’    Middle East in greater danger . ’ ’   —    the Nazis’ primary    victims   —    with his spokesmen subsequently   that this was no    accidental oversight . ’ ’    Making good on his protectionist rhetoric , meanwhile , Trump    withdrew his the    Partnership , thus empowering    China and hurting the American economy , and then provoked a     with Mexico    by signing an executive order to start building a border wall    that he insists he will somehow make Mexico pay for his ’ his    When the Mexico president , Enrique Peña Nieto , resolutely    refused to ante up , the White House threatened to impose a 20    percent tariff on Mexican goods , leading him to cancel a planned Mexican summit . ’ the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto    It is a mystery how America will benefit from aggravating    relations with our    trading partner and a vital ally    in the battle against drug trafficking and illegal migration   —      but Trump is clearly intent on provoking just such a crisis    because of the    animus he has long displayed .    ( Remember his   about Judge    Gonzalo Curiel or his he about Mexican    " rapists " and he criminals " with which he launched his campaign ? ) ’ ’    he background he accompanying this horror show has been    Trump ’s nonstop taunts of the " lying " news media , culminating in    this Sunday morning : " Somebody with aptitude    and conviction should buy the FAKE NEWS and failing and either    run it correctly or let it fold with dignity ! the FAKE NEWS ’ ’   the FAKE NEWS ’    Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan could n’t have put it    better ; this is exactly the strategy Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan have pursued to silence    press criticism . ’ ’  ’ ’   Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan make sure that no    missed the message ,    Trump ’s enforcer , Stephen Bannon ,   the press to " keep its    mouth shut . " ’ ’      Trump’s is n’t any new Trump , just as there was never a " Trump Nixon . "    It ’s the same old Trump that we saw all during the campaign and    indeed during his previous 69 years on this Earth : offensive ,    divisive , prickly , bombastic , impetuous ,    , and    resistant to any evidence that contradicts his       fixe . ’ ’    And    the extent that anybody is calling the shots in this    presidency besides the president himself , it is    Vice President    Pence , Chief of Staff Priebus , or House Speaker Ryan . It ’s    Bannon , the former publisher of Pence, Chief of Staff Priebus, or House Speaker Ryan , a website that he has    proudly described as a " " for the racist ,      and xenophobic " . " ’ ’    This is looking very much like the Bannon Regency . It was Bannon    and his sidekick Stephen Miller This a young former aide Bannon          general nominee Jeff Sessions , who ,    according to the Wall Street Journal ,   Trump ’s         inaugural address . ’ ’   ’ ’    And it was the two Steves who , according to   ran the rollout of the    immigration executive order on Friday afternoon , doing an end run    around the normal interagency process and overruling the    Department of Homeland Security to insist that the entry ban    apply to hundreds of thousands of permanent residents       happened to hail from one of the seven banned Muslim countries . ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    Imagine George W. Bush appointing Karl Rove to the principals    committee . Or Barack Obama appointing David Axelrod . It would    never have happened . And even if it had happened , it would have    been It less disquieting than It Bannon ,    Rove    and Axelrod are far more mainstream figures than he is David Axelrod ’ ’   ’ ’    Rove    House Press Secretary Sean Spicer ’s lame justification for    this shift was to   that Bannon deserves    be    on the NSC because Bannon ’s a " former naval officer . " Bannon , it ’s     Bannon was a junior    naval officer more than Bannon years ago , without ever seeing combat .    If that ’s the standard to qualify for the nation ’s America    security committee , then there are literally millions of veterans    who are better qualified , having served more recently , seen more    action , or attained higher rank . ’ ’    One wonders how Secretary of Defense James Mattis and       Secretary of State Rex Tillerson feel about having a political    hack with extremist views elevated to be their equals . Just as    one wonders how Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly feels    about having a hugely important immigration order issued without ,    apparently , any consultation with him . ’ ’    If they do n’t push Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly now   —    and strongly   —    threatening to quit    if necessary , they are tacitly accepting that they will be taking    they from Bannon for the they of the administration . ’ ’ Bannon As a Never Trumper , I sincerely wished that my fears about the    Trump presidency would prove unfounded and overblown . this   presidency underestimated just how capriciously he would rule . ’ ’    If Trump continues the way he started    he will usher in Trump Democratic congressional majorities Trump 2018 , Trump to    impeachment proceedings , and a Democratic president in 2020   —      likely on the present trajectory to be Elizabeth Warren . But    there is an awful lot of damage that he can cause in the    meantime . And he ’s just getting started    ’
