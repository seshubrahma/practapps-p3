Friday on MSNBC ’s " Morning Joe , " the host of NBC ’s " Meet the Press , " Chuck Todd said the only person who can stop Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump from winning the GOP nomination is Sen. Ted Cruz ( )   Host Joe Scarborough asked , " The only , the way that it could happen is obviously , Chuck Todd , tell me , let Host Joe Scarborough have this discussion . this discussion is a real outside shot right now based on the polls as the polls sit today . Anything can change . Let Host Joe Scarborough say Sen. Ted Cruz ( )   beats Trump in Iowa and then you go to new Hampshire and let Host Joe Scarborough say Christie beats Trump in Iowa in new Hampshire . It Christie beats Trump in New Hampshire . Bush went up five in the poll . If Bush Bush better , I can see bush translating better in South Carolina than Christie Christie That ’s where the story ends for me . My problem with figuring out who beats Donald Trump is the swing south that we ’ve talked about . You were going into the heart of Trump Donald Trump strongest , strongest region there . So what ’s your scenario for an outside scenario for how Trump Donald Trump stopped at this point ? " Todd said , " I think it ’s Cruz . I think it it Cruz Cruz Iowa and somehow , the establishment never coalescing in New Hampshire and allowing maybe Cruz Cruz Trump Donald Trump be basically neck and neck in New New Hampshire especially if Cruz Cruz I think it ’s very possible Cruz    in New Hampshire New Hampshire people expect because of the fact there ’s so many candidates fighting for the moderate wing of that electorate it ’s going to leave Cruz Cruz himself Cruz the Liberals and the smaller group of evangelicals and somehow Cruz Cruz into the Evan   —    evangelical support . I think one guy that can stop Trump is Cruz Cruz " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
