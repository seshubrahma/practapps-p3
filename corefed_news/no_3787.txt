Thursday at the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee update on the Trump administration ’s fiscal policies , Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) peppered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin with hostile questions , interrupting several times over an updated    law .   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said , " Republican platform did have   . We during the campaign and I had the opportunity to work with the president on this , specifically came out and said We do support a 21st century    which is , that means there are aspects of it , okay , that We think may make sense . But We never said before that We supported a full separation of banks   —   " Warren interpreted Mnuchin saying " I ’m sorry , let me just stop you right there , Mr. Secretary . " Mnuchin objected saying , " You ’re not letting me finish . " Warren shot back ,   " Yeah , I ’m not because I really have to understand what you ’ve just said . There are aspects of    that you support , but not breaking up the banks and separating commercial banking from investment banking ? What do you think    was if that ’s not right at the heart of it ? " As Mnuchin tried to explain , Warren said , " So you ’re in favor of    which breaks apart the two arms of banking , regular banking , and commercial banking , except you do n’t want to break apart the two parts of banking . This is like something straight out of George Orwell . " Warren continued the grilling , saying , " This is just bizarre . The idea that you can say we are in favor of    but not breaking up the banks . " Mnuchin said , " we never said we were in favor of   . we said we were in favor of Mr. Chairman . It could n’t be clearer . " She ended by saying , " we are in favor of a bill that is called breaking up the banks only do n’t break up the the banks Thank you , Mr. Chairman . This is crazy .
