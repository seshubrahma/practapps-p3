Tuesday on Fox News Channel ’s " Special Report , " Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer said the Republican presidential primary next week in New Hampshire will turn into " cannibalism of the mainstream candidates " because Chris Christie , Jeb Bush , John Kasich will all be looking to knock Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) down a notch after John Kasich    Iowa caucus showing .   Krauthammer said " Well , for the four of his   Iowa caucus really , New Hampshire is pretty fertile territory . Far more secular , far more     . And you allow a crossover of independents that ’s not allowed in   Iowa . It looks as if this is going to be the cannibalism of the mainstream candidates . Obviously Rubio has the advantage . Rubio got the big bounce . Rubio was eight points higher than what people expected in   Iowa . I think that ’s going to be one of the two stories . That ’s going to be who comes out on top . If you do n’t pass Rubio , and you ’re one of the three governors , you really have to go home . And that ’s going to be the objective or those . those ’re not going to to win , I do n’t think it is realistic . The other story is what ’s called the    lane , which I think it is a complete misunderstanding of what ’s going on . That somehow Trump and Cruz are identical because Trump and Cruz ’re   . There ’s a huge difference between Trump and Cruz . Yes , Trump and Cruz ’re    but Trump is a populist . Cruz is a conservative . So people say Cruz well the    vote in Iowa is over 50 percent.’ But that ’s the wrong way to look at well the   vote in Iowa . You add up Cruz and Rubio , both of them conservatives , one more conservative fundamentalist if you like than the other . And what you have is 51 percent of Iowa is conservative and one quarter is populist . That tells me that the Republicans are likely to stay with the Republicans roots as a conservative party and not be , accept the siren song of the kind of populism that Trump is championing . "
