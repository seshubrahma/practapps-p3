A New York teacher is facing backlash after A New York teacher called A New York teacher students " racist " in a Facebook post . [ The post , which has since been deleted , read , " This week is spirit week at Smithtown HS West . This week ’s easy to spot which students are racist by the Trump gear they ’re sporting for USA Day . "   Students at Smithtown HS West shared differing opinions on Veronica Welsh ’s Facebook post . " A New York teacher made a mistake by putting the school ’s name in it , " a mistake student told CBS 2 . " But A New York teacher has a right to A New York teacher opinion . " " It ’s not a good idea because then like A New York teacher influences the students with the same ideas , " another said . The school ’s the school incident unfortunate and said the post was highly inappropriate . Parents also chimed in long after the original Facebook post was taken down . " There ’s no reason for A New York teacher to pass judgement on those kids on a social platform , " one parent told CBS 2 . " I ’m not big on social media , but I think that in the classroom they need to show both social media , " another said . Welsh did not respond to media requests from the station nor did A New York teacher show up in class on Friday . Welsh has been " administratively Welsh , " and the superintendent said appropriate disciplinary action has been taken , but A New York teacher remains employed by the school .
