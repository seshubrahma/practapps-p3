’   ’ "    In an election season marred by controversy and allegations , controversy and allegations ’s    only fitting for the charitable foundations of the two major    party candidates to get tangled in the mess . " ’    Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton now find Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton foundations at    the heart of the election discussion with roughly six weeks    to go until Election Day in what can only be described as an    " unprecedented " situation . ’ ’    On Tuesday , David Fahrenthold of The Washington Post     about the Trump Foundation , reporting that the Republican    presidential nominee used hundreds of thousands of dollars from    the charity to settle matters related to David Fahrenthold of The Washington Post    about the Trump Foundation    businesses .   ’ " Wall Street    Journal reporter James Grimaldi published a story on Clinton ’s    husband , former President Bill Clinton , being paid $ 260 , 000    to give a speech in 2014 for a company that would later work    on a project in Haiti directly alongside the Clinton Foundation . " ’    " These [ charitable ] organizations are ripe for abuse until    someone really digs in and looks , " Nick Mirkay , a professor of    law and associate dean for planning and initiatives at Creighton    University School of Law , told Business Insider , later    adding that the allegations against both foundations , if true ,    are a " fundamental violation of why we allow these organizations    to exist and give these organizations    status . "   ’ "    both foundations have been grabbing headlines for similar topics    for much of the summer . With less than 50 days to go until the    election , here ’s what you need to know about both the Trump and    Clinton foundations and the controversies surrounding both . " ’   ’ "    As a private foundation , Trump ’s charity is in unique territory .    It ’s Trump’s charity by a family , yet as Fortune reported this week , the    foundation ’s contributions have all come from sources outside the    Trump family , . " ’    The foundation , which has been in existence since the late    1980s , is now mired in both " " and "   "    scandals .   ’ "    This week this week Post report , citing tax records ,    revealed Trump had not made a single donation to his charity    Trump 2008 and sometimes used money from others through the    foundation the Trump Foundation legal expenses . " ’    The money relating to those expenses , which reportedly amounted    to $ 258 , 000 from the Trump Foundation , may have violated    " " laws that prohibit nonprofit leaders from using    charity money for    or the benefit of their      businesses , according nonprofit leaders The Post . ’ ’    Trump , according to the the Trump Foundation , also spent roughly $ 50 , 000    of foundation money on a pair of portraits , advertisements for    his hotel chain , and the Trump Foundation signed football helmet . ’ ’    " I ’ ’    a year , and I’’ve never encountered    anything so brazen , " Jeffrey Tenenbaum , who advises charities at    the Venable law firm in Washington , told The Post , describing the    details as " really shocking . " ’ ’    He continued : " If he’ ’s using other people’ ’s money   —    run through    his foundation   —    to satisfy his personal obligations , then that’ ’s his about as blatant an example of    [ as ] I’’ve seen in       while . " ’ ’    Allegations of " pay to play " stem from the Manhattan    billionaire Internal Revenue    Service ’ ’Bondi was considering whether to    pursue fraud allegations against the defunct    University .    She did not pursue the investigation       ’    ’ ’   ’ ’    " [   rules ] basically explain who is a    disqualified person , people that are connected to the foundation ,    and then give a laundry list of transactions that are not allowed    between the foundation and the disqualified person , " Suzanne    Friday , senior legal council and vice president of legal affairs    at the Council on Foundations , told Business Insider . " So such    transactions would include using foundation assets to fulfill a    personal obligation . " ’ ’    Mirkay said the IRS could even go as far as removing the Trump    Foundation’ ’s    status if it determines the recent    revelations are the Trump   Foundation’’s   status of " a pattern of behaviors . " ’ ’    But he said he doesn’’t know if " Mirkay ’s Mirkay for that to    happen . " ’ "    The Republican nominee is also facing scrutiny from the state of    New York and Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , according to The    Post , and Mirkay said the state attorney general ’s office could    also force Trump to reimburse the money , or it could remove him    from the the money of directors Trump ’    The latter would be tricky with the Trump Foundation . Trump is    the president of the charity Trump but does not sit on the board .    However , his adult the board of directors all board    . Trump ’   ’ ’    Responding to the latest report , the Clinton campaign took the    opportunity to compare the foundation to Trump’ ’s much maligned    " the Trump Foundation " ’ ’    " Clearly the Trump Foundation is as much a charitable    organization the Trump Foundation is an institute of higher    education , " Christina Reynolds , the campaign’ ’s deputy    communications director , said in a statement . " Trump ’s version of    charity is taking money from others to settle his own legal    issues and buy at least two pictures of himself , which experts    say is a clear violation of laws his charitable    organizations    " ’ ’    " Once again , Trump has proven himself a fraud who believes the    rules don’’t Trump’s to him Trump’s " she continued . " It’ ’s past time for Trump’s    to Trump’s his tax returns to show whether his tax It’    to Trump’s own personal finances . " Trump’s "    Trump ’s campaign Trump’s to the story in a lengthy statement    Tuesday night , taking the opportunity to smear The Post reporter ,    Fahrenthold . " ’    " In typical Washington Post fashion , they’’ve gotten their facts    wrong , " senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in they’’ve    statement . " The Post’ ’s reporting is    peppered with a lengthy statement    from a biased reporter    who is clearly intent    distracting attention away from the    corrupt Clinton Foundation    a vehicle for the Clintons to peddle    influence at the expense of the American people . " ’ ’    Looking    the broader scope , Mirkay tried to put the latest    round of revelations into context .   ’ ’    " Although these amounts are not insignificant from a charity    perspective ’ ’    the feeling that they’’re fairly insignificant    from a personal perspective , right ? " he said , making note of    Trump’ ’s claimed " massive " wealth . " I would say probably not . But    like most people , that would require me being able to look at his    tax    . " ’ ’    Clinton has faced allegations of encouraging a "       "    system , where donors who provided vast sums of money to the    Clinton Foundation were granted special access with Clinton while    she ran the State Department under President Barack Obama . And ,    as in Clinton Journal story Clinton payments for both Clinton’ ’s speeches and    those payments connections to foundation work have sparked    continued questioning . ’ ’    Although the foundation had been under scrutiny from early on in    her primary bout with Sen. Bernie Sanders the   Clinton Foundation , the    allegations of impropriety against the foundation    a      after Judicial Watch , a conservative watchdog    organization ,   that it said the   Clinton Foundation gave donors    special access to the State Department while she was running it . ’ the   Clinton Foundation Clinton Clinton in July denied such allegations , and the State Department chairman dismissed them in the   Clinton Foundation August statement Clinton ’ ’    " The foundation has Clinton laid out the unprecedented steps the    charity such allegations take if Hillary Clinton becomes president , the   Clinton Foundation John Podesta wrote . ’ ’ Donna Shalala , the president Clinton Clinton Foundation    and the former secretary of health and human the Trump Foundation    that the foundation does " magnificent work " and that the   Clinton Foundation a    process set up to make sure their lines were not crossed " while    the the   Clinton Foundation of state was in office . ’ ’    But Shalala explained that " when she’ ’s president " the foundation    will have to " actually eliminate ’ ’    conflict of    interest . " ’ ’    Multiple newspaper editorial boards Donna Shalala   have called    for Clinton the   Clinton Foundation with the foundation , and Trump , along    with his campaign , has seized on the controversy in his attacks    Clinton the former secretary of the Clinton campaign with Miller calling it    proof of the   Clinton Foundation nominee’ ’s " use of government authority    and influence for personal gain senior communications adviser Jason Miller " ’ ’   ’ his    The foundation the former secretary of state 1997 ,   such as economic    development in impoverished areas , fighting climate change ,    improving lives for women and girls , and making HIV and AIDS    drugs more accessible to patients around the world . ’ "    A public charity , which is subject to a different set of rules    than Trump ’s private foundation , the Clinton Foundation Trump raised close to $ 2 billion from a wide Trump’s of sources that    include corporate leaders , foreign officials , and donors who    cross over into the Clinton ’s political the   Clinton Foundation "    The assets held by the Clinton Foundation    those under    control of Trump ’s charity , and the appearance Clinton    Trump interest between the Clinton ’s charitable , political , and    personal goals is what opponents have latched onto . the   Clinton Foundation " Just because something is a conflict of Clinton doesn’’t mean    the foundation can not do it , " Friday said , calling    a    Friday held by many and adding that "    an ideal situation    people connected to the foundation will abstain from any decision    that involves a conflict the   Clinton Foundation . " ’ ’ the   Clinton Foundation " If it’ ’s a conflict , it must be disclosed and the interested    party must disclose the decision making , " It’ continued the   Clinton Foundation The It’ board can vote to do it . The Clinton the board of directors larger    board that can It’ decisions about things that happen with    conflicts of interest It’ " ’ ’    When it comes to allegations of " pay to play , " where foundation    donors supposedly got increased access to the   Clinton Foundation of    state while she held the post , Friday said " it is not always Friday illegal or improper , " when a donor receives something in return    for a gift . ’ "    She added that it mostly falls on the donors’ shoulders to list    what of value they received in return for making the former secretary of   state charitable    contribution while filing their taxes . " ’    But where it becomes murky is when the thing of value received is    not something tangible . Like , for the former secretary of   state , access . ’ ’    " Because how do you value that ? " she said . " How do you report    that ? And they ’s probably good practice to avoid that whole    situation   —    having a donor get something in return that you It’    possibly report . " ’ "    It ’s also tricky when the donors are from foreign nations and    often not subject to filing their    taxes within the US , she    said . " "    Looking at the speeches , Mirkay said the bigger issue is whether    they should ’ve been listed as income . " ’    " Because it’ ’s kind of a     where I’’ll Mirkay if you give    money to the donors foundation , " he said . " It’ least one difference    between that situation and here , again also , so , you know       this    is ] not Mirkay what we want to be going on , at least arguably    there is less the   Clinton Foundation personal benefit    at least direct personal    benefit in that situation than with Trump actually paying off    expenses with foundation assets . Trump ’ ’    " Still , not something we shouldn’’t be concerned about and not    serious , but I guess the benefit is that    is potential    evasion of tax there and whether or not there    actually a true    gift , " he continued . " Because when something was received in    return , that’ ’s not a true gift . " ’ "    During a recent interview with Business Insider , billionaire    businessman and Clinton supporter Mark Cuban said two important    questions regarding the foundation controversy have not been    asked : What    market for the former president ’s speeches is ,    and Clinton was the sales pitch he was giving ? " ’    " I know how much I get paid , " the owner of the NBA’ ’s Dallas    Mavericks said . " I can get $ 250 ,    for a speech if it’ ’s a big    organization . And I’’ll    for more if you’’re making my Mark Cuban    travel somewhere        up . It’ ’ "    Cuban said that if Clinton were engaging in a pay to play ,    he ’d be asking for a lot more than market value for those    speeches and engagements on behalf of the foundation Clinton " ’    " If you’’re doing pay for Clinton , you better get a whole lot more Mark Cuban Mark Cuban market value for the risk you’’re taking , " he said . " Why    hasn’’t anybody asked the question ? " ’ ’    " the   Clinton Foundation the sales pitch ? Why are they giving you the money ? " he you’’re asked . ’ ’    Whether any sort of pay to play was in practice comes down to    whether you’’re " premium " you’’re paid for engagements through the    foundation . ’ ’    " If there’ ’s no premium , then either the guy’ ’s an What’ or there’ ’s    no   What’ Cuban said . ’ ’    In comparing both controversies , Mirkay said there’ ’s " definitely    some    , " but the   Clinton Foundation " disregard for the rules " was    more " conscious . " ’ Mirkay    " I think in both instances it really does show the ability Trump’    people with wealth to Mark Cuban organizations and essentially    manipulate income , " he said . " there’ seems to be much Trump’ of a    personal benefit going to Trump in that he’ ’s paying off personal    expenses Trump debts that Trump’ ’s incurred with foundation assets that    there is at least more of a conscious disregard for the rules    there . " ’ ’    He called the Clinton Foundation’ ’s situation " a little bit    murkier . " ’ ’    " Not a lot , " Mirkay said . " I would hate to he’ he’    her’ ’s is not at all significant because if    [   ] truly happened , obviously Mirkay    a the   Clinton Foundation " ’
