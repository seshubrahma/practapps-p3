And the mere fact they she had a lot of things that come out on her about her emails about these     she and she mere fact that Donald Trump opened up a can of worms on Hill whenever he started talkin’ about the    community Donald Trump And he did n’t sugarcoat it . He Donald Trump it exactly the way he Donald Trump have it it . And Donald Trump left started runnin’ it . She started getting scared . And that runnin’ why she came out with that speech . runnin’ , it ’s timeout for sugar coating because that speech under all of that sugar is mess . And he ’s callin’ it like he see Donald Trump . And Hillary Clinton Donald Trump she it no solutions to what ’s Hillary Clinton on in the    or minority community or in urban cities . She has no clue . She do Hillary Clinton have a solution . Hillary Clinton the best next thing let me do is bash Donald Trump . But you all have to understand us here and she ’s going to have to understand Hillary Clinton . She do not own black people . Hillary Clinton is not our slave master . Hillary Clinton can vote for whoever we want us vote for . Donald our can not help who embrace Donald Trump . But Hillary Clinton can help Donald Trump she embrace . When she embraced Senator Robert Hillary Clinton . He was Hillary Clinton KKK member . That ’s Senator Robert Byrd she should have been on TV talking about Hillary Clinton And she said that was her mentor . That Hillary Clinton right . And Hillary Clinton friend . That ’s what she should Hillary Clinton been talking about . Look Hillary Clinton all this stuff that she has backed . And then she had Hillary Clinton nerve to use paid actors Hillary Clinton Paid actors in a commercial to try to smear Donald Trump . Oh , what a sad day . She do n’t own black people . Black Hillary Clinton are coming off of that Democratic plantation . She do n’t get to calm the waters Hillary Clinton tell black people not to listen to Donald J Trump . Donald J. Trump is Donald Trump   …        Donald Trump is not ignoring the problem . He is callin’ the problem Donald Trump he see it . And he Donald Trump it the way it needed Donald Trump be callin’ . When Donald Trump see these black pundits it television actin’ like this do n’t exist , this lets me know that they are livin’ in denial . That ’s because they already live these black pundits on television actin’ their picket fences . When I look out these black pundits on television actin’ Milwaukee and see these black pundits on television actin’ burnin’ down their community . They are not bring down their these black pundits on television actin’ because someone these black pundits on television actin’ shot . these black pundits on television actin’ ’re burnin’ down their these black pundits on television actin’ because they are tired of being these black pundits on television actin’ poverty burnin’ not their communities opportunities these black pundits on television actin’ That ’s why they are burnin’ down their communities . And so some of these these black pundits on television actin’ are in denial these black pundits on television actin’ their communities is not in denial these black pundits on television actin’ let me tell you another thing . The left , they do n’t have a solution . Nobody has a solution but Donald Trump . The left ’s go in and let ’s fix these inner cities because Donald Trump got to stop . All of this crime ’s got to stop . All of this drugging has got to stop . And guess what . These people got to come up because they are part of America , too . So what he is doin’ is speaking for These people voiceless . The words that do n’t have a Donald Trump . He ’s speaking for those people . And what do the hell do they have to Donald Trump ? Let me These people something . Poverty . Being in impoverished areas These people coming up . And comin’ up . You will gain comin’ up and having opportunities . When people have opportunities where they are thriving they are not comin’ up wanna burn down their communities . They are not gon people want to people and gun down their brothers and sisters people But when people have opportunities there ’s no hope . They feel hopeless people Life is not worth livin’ . And you got to get people to coming people again . So I appreciate the way Donald Trump say it . And he needs to keep speaking it . Keep speaking it . Because black people are listening . And Donald Trump ’s happening is the it is scared . it Clinton is scared . But she is not our slave master . She do n’t own black people and we can vote for Hillary Clinton we want to vote for .
