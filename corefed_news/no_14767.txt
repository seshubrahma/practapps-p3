  ( CNN ) When German Chancellor Angela Merkel meets US President Donald Trump at the White House next week , a lot will be at stake . Not just the important relationship between the two countries , but , potentially , the future of the European Union . US President Donald Trump ’s chaotic entry to the global stage is already having repercussions . US President Donald Trump actions could trigger another tumultuous year in a fragile Europe ever more fragmented by nationalism , Close to a dozen European countries     including Germany     will go to the polls this another tumultuous year in a fragile Europe ever more fragmented by nationalism    many of whom who were buoyed by Trump US President Donald Trump , riding high in the polls . the polls countries     such as France and the Netherlands     the populists could win . Victory for these parties could pull the EU further apart , already weakened with the crisis triggered by Britain ’s Brexit vote .   Europe is in a fragile place right now , a situation exacerbated by Trump ’s apparent ambivalence to its future and easy Europe to criticize leaders like Merkel . As both    and President , Trump has at times Trump’s with the diplomatic dexterity of a rhinoceros . In the case of Merkel , he has Merkel her Merkel of Europe Trump’s refugee crisis , calling it a " catastrophic her handling of Europe’s refugee crisis . " When asked who he would trust , Merkel or Putin , Merkel said : " Merkel ’d start off trusting both . " Trump , who is fixated on trade imbalances , has not just focused his attacks on Merkel Merkel but has Merkel accused Germany of a massive imbalance and taking business from the United States . Add to that already combustible mix a speech by Trump ’s VP Mike Pence in front of Merkel in Germany recently Merkel where Germany tried to reassure Merkel about Trump ’s support without Trump’s the EU , and it is clear just how critical to Europe ’s future next week ’s White House meeting could be . With key elections taking place this year , one thing seems certain : Whatever the outcome , the status quo in Europe can not continue . Europe has a habit of repeating itself in Europe . But History the Europe world of    news , this is easily overlooked . What we are witnessing on both sides of the Atlantic is a steady slip toward division and change for the sake of change . But for all the talk around Trump ’s presidency , it is in Europe where this decade ’s Europe profound political changes could occur . Elections in the Netherlands on Wednesday and in France next month risk dismantling a world order that has seen peace in Europe for nearly three generations Europe   In Holland , Geert Wilders and his Freedom party are surfing Geert Wilders wave of    sentiment , buoyed by dissatisfaction with traditional political parties . In France , the National Front France Marine Le Pen     who inherited the mantle of nationalist leader from her father     is doing what he never managed : taking the National Front’s Marine Le Pen    who inherited the mantle of nationalist leader from her father     fringe    party and the National Front’s Marine Le Pen    who inherited the mantle of nationalist leader from her father     it into potentially the most his fringe    political force in France . And when Germany France to the polls later this year , Europe ’s former moral compass , Chancellor Merkel , faces increasing dissatisfaction with her handling of Europe ’s her crisis , Europe her vulnerable to attacks from her right . The depth to which they are cutting in to her political real estate could her measured at her recent speech in front her Pence and Europe ’s    diplomats . Europe said : " Islamist her is also being perpetrated very close to the European Union ’s external borders and thus has a strong impact on Europe . This is another Europe why cooperation with the United States of America is of course very important for us . " For the leader who garnered global praise for telling Syria ’s war ravaged refugees Germany ’s doors are open to them , her comments less ravaged refugees Germany two years later represent a remarkable recalibration yet she is doing no more her sniffing the political air and realizing that the winds have shifted . British Prime Minister Theresa May is doing the same . In June last year , while still a senior cabinet minister in David Cameron ’s government , she campaigned against Brexit . her But since becoming Prime Minister , she has sounded more in her of a    " hard Brexit " than the official Leave campaign , and more like Nigel Farage and his      UK Independence Party Nigel Farage May ’s apparent Brexit priority is controlling immigration Brexit Business comes second , and yet , as there is no groundswell of buyer ’s remorse , she still seems to be sniffing the political wind correctly . It is becoming increasingly clear the political wind Europe that a significant part of the electorate looks across the Atlantic and likes what it sees . Were Le the political wind to win the presidency in France , she would likely begin the she of untethering France from its European partners France changing France currency and calling for a Frexit vote . Similarly in the Netherlands , Wilders would also try to take the country out of the France That he is unlikely to succeed has Wilders to do with his popularity on the streets and Wilders to do with the fractured nature of Dutch politics .   Even if his party does get more votes Wilders any other in the Parliament , no other party would partner with him to bring him to power Wilders What happens Wilders Holland and France paints only part of the picture . More than a dozen other European countries also have elections this year : Hungary , the Czech Republic and Denmark , to name but three . Each has its own popular ,    movement Hungary, the Czech Republic and Denmark Nationalists are trading on the same fears that nationalists have always exploited : distrust of outsiders . In Europe today , radical Islamist terror , the human exodus from wars in the Middle East and the EU ’s free movement of people within its borders are proving a perfect EU for the    populists . Sixty years ago , when Europe ’s leaders first sought to Europe their national economies together , decreasing Europe’s leaders rationale for war , they were fresh from the lessons Europe’s leaders World War II and needed no history books to point them in the right direction . Europe’s leaders had survived the war and Europe’s leaders the price war to be paid . Today , there are fewer voices and the lessons of history are dimming . While no one predicts a return to the horrific slaughter and appeasement of that dark chapter from history , some of the hallmarks of the intolerance that were its precursor can be seen . In Europe , hate crime is on the rise . In the aftermath of the Brexit vote , a Polish man was killed in an attack that police are treating as a possible hate crime . Since January , we have been reading more and more about    attacks and vandalism in the United States . History shows us again and again that the more leaders identify immigration as a problem , the more immigrants pay a price . But history can only partially prepare us for what is happening . In we , the    populists come in different shapes and sizes . Late last year , Italians voted against their Prime Minister Mateo Renzi in a Italians on constitutional reform . Though his party is still in power , their Prime Minister Mateo Renzi effective winner was Italy ’s    Five Star Movement . Around the same time , in Austria ’s presidential election , the nationalist candidate lost not to a mainstream candidate , but to the Green Party candidate . In Holland , one of the challengers to populist Wilders is from another outsider , Alexander Pechtold of D66 : a different kind of populist who advocates for abortion , euthanasia , prostitution and marijuana use . Europe ’s political jigsaw is a picture in transition : the traditional red and blue hues shading the left and right divide are being replaced . In Iceland , following months of traditional parties trying to form a government , the Pirate Party has been passed the political baton . They advocate the citizens’ direct participation in the Pirate Party , everyone voting on all decisions     big and small . It ’s an idea that may not have come of age yet , but the seed has been planted . Five Star and D66 have similar aspirations . Europe is not so much Europe a crossroads , as a terminus . The status quo appears to be over . Postwar political certainties that for so long seemed as solid as the Berlin Wall are collapsing and are being discarded . There is no shortage of trains departing for other destinations . Some offer swift transit to liberal utopias others offer rides to the past . The common thread running through so many European countries is ironically something that inevitably divides them : nationalism . This nationalism is so many European countries used to paint the leaders of Europe as an Europe’s leaders national values down the river in favor of globalization and the European project , much the same arguments Trump used to win Trump’s way to the Trump’s House . How his conversation with Merkel Trump’s next week Merkel cast a long shadow over the polling booths of Europe . What happens there Europe the coming months will tell us a lot about what to expect over the next few years . Voters would do well to reflect on history , listen to some seasoned voices before their recollections fade and the illumination they offer sputters out Voters leaving the old continent in Voters dark . As with Brexit , once selected , Brexit is no easy turning back .
