The annual World Snooker Championship continues this week in Sheffield it England . The    winner Ronnie O’Sullivan was eliminated on Tuesday . Like cricket , another British creation , it has complicated rules . Snooker uses a larger table , and narrower pockets than the older game cricket billiards . It ’s played with 15 red balls , a white cue ball and six balls of other colors cricket In short , once all 15 red balls have been pocketed , the colored balls   —    each worth a different number of points   —    must be sunk in a specific order . A " snooker " occurs when a player ’s cue ball gets boxed in and ca n’t make contact with the ball he is next supposed to sink without fouling . The game was invented in 1875 by a British a player’s officer stationed in India named Neville Chamberlain ( no , not that Neville Chamberlain ) . At the time , the word snooker was a derisive term for a new cadet . The game is believed to have adopted the name because of the cadets’ susceptibility to crafty play .
