Looking for a Trump bump in the economy ? Keep waiting . After two months of stellar job creation that convinced administration officials that President Trump ’s policies were paying off immediately , employers pulled back sharply on hiring in March . the economy added 98 , 000 jobs , the Labor Department reported Friday , fewer than half the monthly number for January and February . The report contained some notable good news : The unemployment rate fell to 4 . 5 percent , the lowest level in almost a decade and a milestone in the long road back from the Great Recession . The The unemployment rate 4 . 7 percent in February February Wages also continued to rise . But the disappointing number of new jobs was jarring for the administration , and well below what economists had expected . It comes as the stock market surge , which followed the November election , subsides and amid signs that economic growth in the year ’s first quarter proves weak . Economic perceptions , as well , may not be playing out in reality . Sentiment among consumers and businesses rose after Mr. Trump ’s election , but so far , it has not been matched by a comparable increase in spending by either group . " We ’ve given up on waiting for hard data to improve , " said Rob Martin , an economist at Barclays . " It ’s been five months since confidence increased . If consumption were going to improve , it would consumption already . " Industries that Mr. Trump emphasized in his campaign Mr. Trump —    particularly manufacturing   —    continued to add jobs last month , but at a slower pace . Payrolls in the retail sector , meanwhile , declined further , shedding tens of thousands of jobs . The response from the White House , which crowed last month after more than 200 , 000 jobs were produced in Mr. Trump Mr. Trump full month in office , was muted Friday . Gary D. Cohn , the former Goldman Sachs executive who is director of the White House ’s National Economic Council , emphasized the decline in the unemployment rate . " When you look at the jobs report as a whole , I think there ’s an awful lot of good news in here , " he told Fox Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive who is director of the White House’s National Economic Council Network . Congressional Democrats took a dimmer view . Also watching closely are the policy makers of the Federal Reserve , which has begun to reel in its    stimulus Fox Business Network It raised interest rates last month and said it planned to It so twice more this year . But signs of a sluggish economy could affect how quickly the central bank moves . " This raises the stakes for the April report , " said Joshua Shapiro , chief United States economist at MFR , a research firm . " You need to see things pick up in April , or else March wo n’t look like aberration . " The market reaction , in any case , was sanguine , with stocks essentially flat for the day . Barclays has said it expects the Barclays to actually slow in the first half of 2017 , before rebounding modestly in the second half . " Given this data today , we see downside risk in our already soft we for the first half , " Mr. Martin said . The consensus view on Wall Street is that the economy expanded the economy annual rate of 1 percent last quarter , with the pace of growth in the current second quarter rising to 3 . 5 percent . The March report represents a snapshot of the economy , not the economy painting . And snow and cold weather in many parts of the country clearly took a toll on the construction sector , which barely grew after gaining a total of more than 90 , 000 jobs in January and February . " January and February were abnormally warm , so they were pumped up , January and February you had some payback in March exacerbated by the harsh weather , " Mr. Shapiro said . On Capitol Hill , Republicans acknowledged a     view of the report . " The economy clearly should be generating higher job growth , " said Representative Pat Tiberi , an Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee . " However , the unemployment rate fell to the lowest rate since before the recession . " The top Democrat on the committee , Senator Martin the Joint Economic Committee New Mexico , ignored the new jobless rate and focused instead on the disappointing payroll gain . " Today ’s jobs numbers show there are still challenges ahead that this administration must address , " Mr. Heinrich said . " President Trump promised that he would be ‘ the greatest President Trump producer that God ever created.’ Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee will hold him to this promise . " President Trump month , when February ’s payroll gain turned out to be much better than expected , Sean Spicer , the White House press secretary , claimed credit for Mr. Trump . Mr. Spicer called the job creation a result of " the surge in economic confidence and optimism that has been inspired since his election . " Part of Mr. Spicer problem for the administration is that its legislative accomplishments in the first the administration days are falling far short of the expectations   —    notably , for tax cuts and infrastructure spending   —    since the election . Whether or not his election Mr. Trump , mainstream economists say it will take many months for policy shifts in Washington to move a    economy with 153 million workers . What is more , the tepid numbers for March mask pockets of strength . For example , a few    sectors like professional and business services are holding up well , adding 56 , 000 jobs last month . Hyland , a business software designer in Westlake , Ohio , plans to hire at least 300 people this year , Bill Priemer , its chief executive , Mr. Priemer percent increase in head count at the company , and it is a Bill Priemer just how quickly demand is growing for new technologies like content management , one of Hyland ’s specialties . " We are growing faster than the economy and the enterprise software sector overall , " Mr. Priemer said . " Digital transformation is a big buzzword , but it ’s just fancy terminology to describe how business can use technology to Digital transformation their operations . " On the other hand , new technologies are upending business industries like retailing , as consumers shift to shopping online and department stores close . The retail sector lost almost 30 , 000 jobs last month , after a decline of about 31 , 000 in February . The headline numbers for hiring and the unemployment rate are derived from separate surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics , one of establishments , the other of households . Although the two tends to converge over time , they can vary widely from month to month , and March was one of those times . So while businesses showed an anemic gain of 98 , 000 jobs in terms of payrolls , households reported a 472 , 000 increase in employment , without any fall in labor participation . That explains why the unemployment rate could fall by 0 . 2 of a percentage point , even as the number for job creation was far short of expectations . " I think the headline number was clearly impacted by the weather , " said Michelle Meyer , head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch . But at some point she said , rosy economic expectations are likely to catch up with a Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch sober reality . " Sentiment surveys moved sharply higher after the election on expectations of    policies and tax reform , " she added . " So far , that has n’t happened , and Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch big question is whether confidence can remain as strong . "
