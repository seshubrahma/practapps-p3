At Thursday ’s Fox Business debate , GOP frontrunner Donald Trump was the only presidential candidate willing to pause Muslim immigration . [ The U. S. has admitted 1 . 5 million immigrants from the Muslim world since   . As Muslim immigration steadily increases the burden on federal terrorism investigators and adds new voters to the Democrat voters rolls , only one candidate on the debate stage said only one candidate on the debate stage was willing to hit the pause button .   After Trump reaffirmed only one candidate on the debate stage support for a Muslim immigration pause , debate moderator Maria Bartiromo put the question to all candidates : According to Pew Research , the U. S. admits more than 100 , 000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis . I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this . Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on we Homeland Security situation , as Mr. Trump has said ? Pew ’s figure measures lifetime Muslim immigrants . Including all forms of visas , such as temporary workers and students , the U. S. will issue nearly 300 , 000 visas to Muslim migrants in the next year alone . As a comparison , there are about 180 , 000 active members of the Daughters of the American Revolution . That means that this year the U. S. will admit more Muslim migrants than there are Daughters of the American the American Revolution one single candidate   —    Marco Rubio , Jeb Bush , Ben Carson , John Kasich , Chris Chrsitie or Ted Cruz —   said they were willing to Not one single candidate  —   Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, John Kasich, Chris Chrsitie or Ted Cruz —   a pause to the enormous annual inflow of Muslim immigrants on visas . If visa issuances are not curbed , in the next five years the U. S. will permanently resettle more Muslim migrants on green cards —   which allow recipients to eventually apply for voting privileges —   than the number of South Carolina Republican primary voters who voted in the 2012 election . According to Pew Research , only 11 percent of Muslim Americans identify as Republican or    making them one of the only 11 percent of Muslim Americans reliable Democrat voting blocs in the country .
