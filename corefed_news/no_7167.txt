MarketWatch reports that the U. S. trade deficit " jumped 8 . 7 % in June to a    high of $ 44 . 5 billion , reflecting the higher cost of oil and more imports of consumer goods such as cellphones and drugs . " [ the U. S. trade deficit increased because imports rose by $ 227 . 7 billion , while exports were up only $ 183 . 2 billion , with particularly sluggish oil and    exports . The trade gap with China hit its China mark since last November , thanks to heavy imports of "   computers , cell phones , and clothing , " per ABC News . On the other hand , U. S. exports to the European Union and United Kingdom were up .   Reuters notes June was the third straight month to see an increase in the trade deficit . Economists predicted a much smaller deficit of $ 43 . 1 billion by the end of June June compared to the    $ 64 . 7 billion that was realized . Reasons cited for the the trade deficit higher demand for consumer goods   —    which MarketWatch suggests is a signal that " Americans are still spending at a pace consistent with a fairly healthy , albeit slowly , expanding economy "   —    a $ 5 . 19 per barrel rally in oil prices , and the U. S. dollar regaining strength after the Brexit vote . The Associated Press cites economists who " do not expect a large impact on the U. S. economy from Britain ’s decision to leave the E. U. " going forward . The oil price spike , in particular , was the largest    increase in over five years , and the fourth straight month in which oil prices rose . The AP notes that before that trend began , oil prices had fallen low enough to push the value of imports down , and keep this year ’s trade deficit 2 . 3 percent below the equivalent period in 2015 .   " Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump , seeking to tap into the economic anxiety of Americans who have seen jobs disappear in an increasingly global economy , has accused the Obama administration of failing to protect U. S. workers from unfair trade practices in China and other countries , " the AP notes , adding that Trump ’s proposals include exiting from the North American Free Trade Agreement , killing the    Trade Partnership agreement , and taking a more aggressive approach with China . In addition to China question of disadvantageous trade policies , the new trade deficit report spotlights the importance of oil   —    a fickle beast whose price fluctuations can help or hinder the economy in various ways . In this case , it seems clear that falling oil prices reduced the value of imports , and since those prices have probably begun recovering from    levels , the trade deficit may well grow as oil comes back . ZeroHedge writes extensively on another trouble spot : the accumulation of debt in the United States , which seems to be leaning more towards consumer goods purchases ( as indicated by the reports that consumer demand is driving the trade deficit up ) the trade deficit for the future . Furthermore , a growing trade deficit suggests those U. S. consumer purchases are n’t creating as much profit for domestic industries   —    profit that could be recycled into investment and growth   —    as we would like .   Under this theory , America ’s consumer debt load might be financing more purchases and pushing the trade deficit up , but it the trade deficit economic growth that would normally America’s consumer debt load been associated with low oil prices . As ZeroHedge puts it , debt is " simply a way to America’s consumer debt load what would be future consumption into the present , " and when the future finally gets here , it will have already been   . As for the future debt , former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested in a conference call on Wednesday that the federal government ought to be running a hefty surplus of at least 3 % of GDP , not monstrous deficits , in order to " build up funds to pay for retiring workers . "   That would mean annual surpluses in the $ 500 billion range , which most certainly will not happen under anything resembling    government . And if America ’s trade deficit grows worse , does n’t that mean we ’ll have even less commerce to tap in America future tax base , making the retirement crisis America predicts even worse ?
