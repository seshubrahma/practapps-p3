  ( CNN ) On March 22 , at the doorstep of Parliament in London , an    attacker killed a British police officer and several innocent bystanders , at a time when the British Prime Minister , Theresa May , was inside addressing members of Parliament . The attack occurred on the anniversary of the ISIS attacks in Brussels a year earlier and made one thing quite clear : Europe is still vulnerable to terrorist plots . For every successful terrorist attack that spectacularly makes the news , scores , if not hundreds , are thwarted by the efforts of intelligence and law enforcement organizations , often working with international partners .   These go largely unreported , of course , because These are not really news the dog simply did not bark .    What also goes unreported is the intense , constant cooperation between allied security services as allied security services undertake the unenviable and herculean task of stopping the next terrorist operation .   For the most part , intelligence and law enforcement work behind the scenes , drawing on counterterrorism liaison relationships intelligence and law enforcement have built over the past 20 years , or sometimes longer .   counterterrorism liaison relationships they have built over the past 20 years are probably the single greatest defense the West has against terrorist attacks . So it is literally breathtaking when the President of the United States , which has the largest and    intelligence community in the free world , undermines these key intelligence relationships that keep not only the United States but its the United States as safe as possible .     The most egregious example of late was President Trump ’s fantastical claim that the British signals intelligence agency , GCHQ ( London ’s NSA equivalent ) had agreed to a request from    Obama to monitor the electronic communications of the Trump campaign during last year ’s presidential election .   A clearly angry GCHQ and the British government immediately denied and dismissed the ridiculous and obviously political claim .    There are yellow caution lights blinking on the consoles at the headquarters of our key foreign intelligence liaison partners , and most relate to the positions taken by the new Trump administration . The White House ’s penchant for attempting to use virtually anything for political gain , including sensitive intelligence relationships , is certainly cause of concern abroad .    Good politicians on both sides will correctly state that intelligence relationships with our allies , especially Britain , remain strong , but lies and posturing from the    level of the US government have impact .   In the business of counterterrorism intel sharing , the margins of error are small , a reality brought home most graphically by the London attack . The Brits will understandably be taking an extra look before passing sensitive intelligence to Washington in the near future ( especially if it comes from GCHQ ) . And it it not just the Brits .   Many of our partners are likely ( and understandably ) concerned about the Trump administration ’s    regarding the    impact on intel sharing of things like the " Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States . "   A good number of Middle Eastern intelligence services also quietly share incredibly important and sensitive counterterrorism information with American counterparts , after intelligence and law enforcement on both sides have built up relationships painstakingly over the past several decades .    Many of our dialogue partners on intelligence matters in the Middle East are Muslims who see radical Islamic terrorism as anathema to their radical Islamic terrorism .   Their radical Islamic terrorism relationships with the United States and the West are often not popular with many of their radical Islamic terrorism citizens , and therefore carry some risk .   Imagine , then , the reaction of these key partners to news that the Trump administration remains    on a policy that     call it whatever politically correct phrase you like     amounts to a ban on their these key partners .   Imagine the frustration in    intel services that , being familiar with the problem of terrorism , understand that the vast majority of terrorist attacks by Islamic extremists in the West are authored not by terrorists who infiltrated Western countries , but rather by citizens of those countries who    ( as looks to be the case with the recent attack in London ) .    Again , the White House ’s policies may cause these important liaison partners to be more circumspect with what they these important liaison partners to share in the future , which could have disastrous consequences . The Trump administration is still young , and many of our these important liaison partners showing great patience and taking a wait and see attitude     but such attitudes will not last forever .   And if the administration continues The Trump administration a    approach to sensitive intelligence relationships , erosion of intelligence relationships will eventually begin .   Such erosion does not make America great , but rather vulnerable .
