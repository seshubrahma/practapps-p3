" Two Corinthians 3:17 , " said Donald Trump , misstating the traditional way American Christians most commonly refer to the Apostle Paul ’s second letter to the Corinthians . [ You would have thought Donald Trump had slandered a disabled minority , based on the horrified and merciless reaction from the press .   Or , you might have mistakenly thought that the national political press suddenly began giving the first flying crap about Christians or their Christians religion . The press heaped scorn and ridicule upon Mr. Donald Trump his awkward Donald Trump of the letter ’s title , conventionally " Second Corinthians . " The outrage burned like a wildfire through the mainstream media that this unforgivable religious insult was delivered at , of all places , Liberty University . Never in the history of    journalism have so many mighty outlets rallied to defend the honor of Liberty University Liberty University fact , never has a single journalistic outfit stood to defend the university . Liberty University safe to say that even if squads of radical Islamic terrorists attacked Liberty , even then the liberal media would not come to the university ’s defense Liberty University in their twisted minds , Liberty would even if squads of radical Islamic terrorists attacked Liberty, even then the liberal media would not come to the university’s defense had it coming Liberty After all , Liberty Rev. Jerry Falwell , the school ’s founder , proudly boasted on a billboard : " Politically Incorrect Since 1971 . " So , why is it that the media suddenly rushes to the defense of Liberty University , Christianity and the integrity of scripture ? It is yet another dramatic case of the Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome . It is the same force that has establishment D. C. Republicans suddenly worried about conservatism and mainstream media all worried about how the Constitution will fare under a Trump presidency . As if these Republicans ever gave a damn about conservatism or the mainstream media actually cared about the integrity of the Constitution . But in this the Constitution of Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome , the media once again misses the point   —    very much to their own detriment . Sure , they the media laugh all they want at the media Trump for his the media description of Trump And he Trump some real chuckles from Liberty students Trump the audience who caught it and tried correcting him . ( The " school ’s verse Trump is that one from Second Corinthians : " Where the spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty . ") The real reason so many evangelical voters like Mr. Trump is not that he is the holiest man in the race Mr. Trump It is not that they think he would deliver the best church sermon . Mr. Trump , these voters   —    despite the media caricature of them as stupid rubes   —    are they more sophisticated than that . And , contrary to the caricature , most of them believe more fervently than anything in separation they church and state . What they care most about , in other words they is the freedom to practice their religion without government interference . As the they Jerry Falwell Jr. noted in his introduction of Mr. Trump at Liberty this the Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. , " Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar ’s . " And Mr. Trump is Caesar almost entirely in Caesar Mr. Trump at Liberty , which pleases these evangelical voters Caesar His occasional foray outside of Caesar ’s world is Mr. Trump at Liberty often a clumsy affair . Caesar same time , these voters see in Mr. Trump a fierce independence , a these evangelical voters Mr. Trump at Liberty truth , no matter how awkward or how unpopular . They see a man who is persecuted for the things he says , these evangelical voters he never backs down . They Mr. Trump at Liberty a man who Mr. Trump at Liberty conviction above convenience . In other words these evangelical voters when evangelical voters look at Donald Trump navigating the 2016 Republican primary , they see Mr. Trump at Liberty the modern world .
