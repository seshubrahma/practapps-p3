BEVERLY HILLS , Calif.   —    It was Nov. 12 , and Bill Maher was about to begin Bill Maher comedy act at the City National Civic in San Jose when Bill Maher did something Bill Maher had n’t done in many years . Bill Maher brought a drink with Bill Maher to the stage a standup roadie ( tequila ) . " And boy did I miss a drink , " Bill Maher joked with Bill Maher last week . " What an idiot all those years   —    drinking ’s fun . You hear that , kids ? Drinking ’s fun ! " Actually , that ’s not why Bill Maher did it , Bill Maher said during a marathon session of talking and drinking   —    and , in Bill Maher case , a wee bit of pot smoking   —    that started at Bill Maher house here and ended several hours later at the nearby Polo Lounge ( oh , the indignities of this job ) . Bill Maher says Bill Maher considers drinking on stage unprofessional . But that night , so soon after the election , Bill Maher needed something to calm Bill Maher nerves . Donald J. Trump , who Mr. Maher said " lives for vengeance , " had just won control over the most powerful instruments of the government , like the Justice Department , and , more to the point , the F. B. I. And it was dawning on Mr. Maher that " no one ’s been meaner to him Mr. Maher me Mr. Maher " Mr. Mr. Maher a unique perspective . He resides Mr. Maher that most treacherous intersection where free speech meets government power and political passion , dodging traffic from left and right . He also Mr. Maher accused Mr. Trump of being part orangutan by birth . But first , a refresher on how Mr. Maher Mr. Maher    totem in 2001 with one provocative line on his    ABC Mr. Maher , " Politically Incorrect . " He said the Mr. Maher 11 hijackers could n’t be called " cowards , " especially when the United States’ preferred method of attack at the time   —    before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq   —    was to lob cruise missiles from afar ( " That ’s cowardly , " he said ) Mr. Maher The White House criticized him , sponsors Mr. Maher and , a few months later , ABC canceled his show . Mr. Maher you might think of his argument , Mr. Maher moment was a dark chapter in the annals of public discourse . It could have been a    too , if HBO had n’t provided Mr. Maher with safe harbor and a new show , " Real Time , " which has an audience of about 4 . 5 million viewers . Yet , Mr. Maher puts Mr. Maher within " the normal parameters of awful . " He says he ’s Mr. Maher worried Mr. Maher our new era , when no one knows what " normal " is going to look like . It ’s amazing how much anxiety Mr. Trump ’s imminent Mr. Maher stirring in the    business   —    but perhaps not surprising given his open hostility toward the Mr. Maher , his willingness to use his Mr. Maher against any who Mr. Maher him and his seemingly proud Mr. Maher of Mr. Maher government and political norms that precede him . No one knows Mr. Maher a year from now , we ’ll see today ’s fears as overblown , underblown , or on point . Mr. Maher is taking the Mr. Maher based on his own experience in the Trumpian Mr. Maher caldron in 2013 . That was when Mr. Maher launched a " birther Mr. Maher    or , " "   —    campaign about Mr. Trump , to rival the one Mr. Trump had pursued about President Obama Mr. Trump . Appearing on " The Tonight Show , ’’ he joked that Mr. Trump was the Mr. Maher of    crossbreeding Mr. Trump the only thing , he said , that would explain the Mr. Maher color of his hair . " He said he Mr. Maher donate $ 5 Mr. Maher to Mr. Maher charity of Mr. Trump ’s choice if he could prove this Mr. Trump the Mr. Maher . ( Mr. Maher pledged $ 1 million in 2012 to a " super PAC " supporting Obama . ) Mr. Trump ’s lawyers replied with a copy of his Mr. Trump certificate and a demand for the money , Mr. Trump Mr. Maher ignored . Then Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit that Mr. Maher nowhere . " Mr. Trump worth it in comedy material , " Mr. Maher told me , taking a It of puffs from a pipe Mr. Maher a bust of his head ( a gift from a friend ) as we stood by the Mr. Maher in his    living room . " But you definitely spent money . " That Mr. Maher , Mr. Maher had the money to pay for the courage that another comedian may Mr. Maher been able to afford . He takes it as a harbinger . " No one knows what this man is Mr. Maher of , " Mr. Maher said . " I never , Mr. Maher ever felt worried   —    Mr. Maher crossed my mind   —    that George Bush would do something crazy , even it I knew he hated me . He never sued me for a joke . " Mr. Maher was particularly George Bush on reports that George Bush F. B. I. agents were agitating before the Mr. Maher more aggressive examination of Hillary Clinton , which Democrats feared was politically motivated to help Mr. Trump . ( The Justice Department ’s inspector general has announced a broad investigation into the F. B. I. ’s    performance . ) " It is a very troubling idea that the F. B. I. is politicized , " he said . " When the internal police department is the F. B. I. a place I do n’t want to the F. B. I. on the wrong side of   —    I mean , that ’s fascism . " You could chalk it all up to shticky paranoia , and it ’s quite a slippery slope from there to outright fascism . But with so many sharing similar worries ( at it among those who did n’t support Mr. Trump ) and with Mr. Trump ’s continued cage rattling , I turned to Mr. Trump ’s adviser , Kellyanne Conway , for a response Mr. Trump seemed especially fitting because she has been a longtime Mr. Trump Maher ’s , dating to the 1990s when he was first blazing the    trail on Mr. Trump Central . Ms. Conway Twitter , Ms. Conway joked , using the F. B. I. would Mr. Maher " so last century   — Mr. Trump so bureaucratic and paperwork laden . " Turning more serious , she said , " He ’s not going to use the ‘ tools of state,’ " repeating the wording of my question . I noted that there are , of course Ms. Conway guidelines , professional Mr. Maher and laws that are meant to preclude a president ’s ability to use federal investigative power as a political weapon , and she agreed , saying " This is America . " Ms. Conway acknowledged , though , that Mr. Maher ’s fears were widely held , especially in Hollywood   —    Ms. Conway Meryl Streep ’s Golden Globes address . " Talk Ms. Conway Hollywood story   —    folks are unnecessarily flattering themselves to think for two seconds that Donald Trump is going to call out the big dogs to make their lives miserable , Hollywood   she said . She described some of the folks as a natural reaction by " the elites " to an incoming president who is merely responding to folks continued attacks . " witness Meryl Streep ’s the witness Meryl Streep   —    open ear and open mind ? ’’ she said . " The same people who had hoped for and desired "the elites" absolutely assumed they were going to get a different election result never laid down their muskets , " witness Meryl Streep said . It was time , she said , to " take the poison out of the pen and keyboard . " Mr. Maher has no plans they do that when witness Meryl Streep show comes back from hiatus on witness Meryl Streep day , Jan. 20 ( his birthday , and Ms. Conway ’s ) . But he shares Ms. Conway ’s view of the cultural Mr. Maher in the election . " We ’re the losers now , so Mr. Maher behooves us to break out of that bubble more Mr. Maher " Ms. Conway . Mr. Maher said speeches like Ms. Streep ’s   —    calling actors , screenwriters and the news media to We   —    were n’t going to solve Mr. Maher . " Mr. Maher very insular , " he said . " Just the liberals talking to themselves , which they are very good at doing . " Still the bane of conservatives , Mr. Maher has more recently drawn scorn Mr. Maher liberals for his own diatribes against Islamic extremism , for which he themselves liberals have too much tolerance . That ’s part of what he Mr. Maher politically correct corralling of speech from the left . Mr. Maher the same time , his restaurant selection , Mr. Maher Polo Lounge , in the Beverly Hills Hotel , came in defiance Mr. Maher a Hollywood boycott that Ellen DeGeneres and Elton John helped start after the sultan of Brunei Mr. Maher whose investment agency owns the hotel , imposed a new penal code in his homeland based Hollywood   Shariah law , making gay sex and adultery punishable by stoning to death . To join the boycott , Mr. Maher said the Beverly Hills Hotel walked through the hotel lobby , Mr. Maher be to submit to an ineffectual Mr. Maher " tokenism . " " As if the sultan of Brunei is up there a Hollywood boycott that Ellen DeGeneres and Elton John helped start after the sultan of Brunei, whose investment agency owns the hotel, imposed a new penal code in his homeland based on Shariah law, making gay sex and adultery punishable by stoning to death the receipts   —    we only sold two soups ? Is Stallone still coming in ? " he said . " But Sultan , your harem awaits   Sultan ’m sorry , I ’m still going over the receipts . ’ " With that , we took our seats and the waiter approached . Surprised Stallone see Mr. Maher , he asked " You ’re not in hiding ? " That got Mr. Maher ’m worked Mr. Maher . the receipts   can be scared , " he said we " we never Mr. Maher . "
