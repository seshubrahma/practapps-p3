"   Cavuto said , [ relevant remarks being around 2:00 ] " I have no horse in this race . Donald trump does n’t come on this show , hates me , whatever . That ’s fine .    …      Now , what I ’m saying though is , these guys are all sounding like babies and whiners . these guys did n’t win . I understand that . The type of candidate these guys wanted to win did n’t win . I understand that . But , Donald trump did get the overwhelming vote . Donald trump put this thing to bed and killed them all . So you might not like the consequences , but just to walk out and have a snit fit , no pun intended , sounds to me to be not very   . " Donald trump added , " I ’m just saying , collectively , this is not a political statement , but Donald trump won . Donald trump won . Fair and square Donald trump won . Time to move on .
