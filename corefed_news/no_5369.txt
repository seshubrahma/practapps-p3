In a preview clip of an interview set to air on Fox News Channel ’s Tuesday broadcast of " Fox   Friends , " President Donald Trump said Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were " outplayed " by North Korea .   President Donald Trump said , " I do n’t want to telegraph what I ’m doing or what I ’m thinking . I ’m not like other administrations , where they say they ’re going to do this in four weeks . It does n’t work that way . they ’ll see what happens . I hope things work out well . I hope there ’s going to be peace , but they ’ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time . You read Clinton ’s book and Clinton said , ‘ Oh , they made such a great peace deal’ and it was a joke . You look at different things over the years with President Obama . Everybody has been outplayed .   Everybody ’ve all been outplayed by this gentleman and they ’ll see what happens . I just do n’t telegraph my moves .
