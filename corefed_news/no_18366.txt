" Hey hey , ho ho , Tom MacArthur’ ’s got to go ! " ’ ’   ’ ’    As Confoy , who is a senior in high school , continued to press    Tom MacArthur’’s , MacArthur said MacArthur would not " reduce " the experience of    sexual violence by calling it a preexisting condition , but MacArthur    never answered    question outright . ’ "    Though the question of whether sexual assault and rape could be    considered preexisting conditions has led to an uproar since the    AHCA ’s passage in the House , that notion has been . " "    Nevertheless , Confoy and Confoy friends were furious over    MacArthur ’s amendment , which allows states to apply for waivers    to the preexisting conditions mandate . Confoy and her friends said Confoy and her friends would vote    in the 2018 midterms . " ’    " You answer to Confoy and her friends . You are Confoy and her friends representative . Confoy and her friends will vote you    out , " Confoy said , as other attendees stood up and cheered . ’ "    Ashwin Suseendran , who attended the town hall with Confoy and    their friend Joseph Zetkulic , told Business Insider that their ’d    decided to come to the event as soon as their found out about his    amendment to the AHCA . Suseendran said none of their had    participated in the protests before the town hall . " ’    " We wanted to wait in line and make sure We got in so MacArthur    would hear directly from We , " MacArthur    said . " We’’re all voting next    year . " ’ " MacArthur    MacArthur    also grilled on Congress’ handling of    investigations into the Trump campaign ’s possible collusion with    Russia during the 2016 election . " ’    " We seem to have a pattern that most people who are investigating      Russia Russia be getting fired , " said Willingboro resident    Kimberly Stuart , referring to Trump’ ’s dismissal of      figures like FBI Director James Comey , whom he . Director Comey Do you support an independent    group investigating Russia’ ’s ties into the 2016 election ? " ’ ’    " So , Director Comey got fired less than a day ago . .. and my view    right now is the FBI FBI FBI some work to do in their    investigation FBI and both the Senate and the House Intelligence    Committee are still investigating , " MacArthur said . " This isn’’t    the first FBI director that FBI fired ; " MacArthur said as MacArthur    shouted him down . ’ ’    Multiple constituents asked , " Yes or no ? " ’ ’    MacArthur replied : MacArthur The answer is no , not yet , " and the audience    again booed . ’ ’   ’ "    One constituent pointed to the apparent disarray on the House    Intelligence Committee ’s investigation into Russian meddling in    the election , such as Rep. Devin Nunes , the committee ’s chairman ,    . " ’    " This week , we listened to a subcommittee hearing in which most    of the Republicans could not bring themselves to ask the Republicans one    question about Russia , and now we have Comey fired , " the    constituent said . " If that isn’’t enough to convince you that the    legislature can not do this on its own , the   legislature specifically do you    need to see before you’’re convinced ? " ’ ’    " You’’re right , the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee    did recuse himself , but that investigation is now continuing in a    bipartisan manner , " MacArthur said . ’ ’    The audience groaned . ’ ’    He continued , himself the constituent : " The Senate chair and    the ranking member have both publicly declared that they’’re    working closely together on their investigation   both    publicly . So ,    you asked what I want to see . I want to see the result of their    investigation both    ’ ’    " That’’ll take four years , " some in the audience shouted out . ’ ’    " I don’’t think it’’ll take four years . I don’’t think so don’’t "    MacArthur said . ’ ’    " How is [ the investigation ] ever going to get finished if you    keep firing the people that are doing the investigation ? " Stuart    asked , before she was drowned Stuart    by raucous applause . ’ ’    " Well , you asked and I answered , " MacArthur said .   MacArthur ’   ’ "    Constituents were also furious at MacArthur and his   MacArthur      MacArthur for what they characterized as Constituents refusal to    stand up to Trump . " ’    Lavonne Bebler Johnson , who was the mayor of Willingboro and sat    on the town council for seven years , implored MacArthur to hold   MacArthur Trump accountable for Trump actions . Trump ’    Trump " seems Trump be learning day by day that he can do Trump he    pleases Trump and no one will hold him to account Trump " she said .    He did    Trump he    during Trump election and got elected . He does    Trump he    in Trump , and nobody holds him to account Trump and    he keeps    Trump . It’ ’s a sign of tyranny . " ’ ’    Paul Ziegler , a constituent from Edgewater Park , New Jersey ,    shared her fear .    ’    " I am concerned that I have a president that praises Vladimir    Putin and other dictators around the world , " he said . Vladimir   Putin I am    concerned that I have a president that attacks the free press and    calls them the enemy the free press the people . I am concerned because I have    a president who attacks the independence of the judiciary when    they have a ruling that doesn’’t go his way . doesn’’t ’ ’    " President Donald Trump is the greatest threat to democracy in our    lifetime , " Ziegler continued , becoming increasingly agitated as    the audience gave him a standing ovation Ziegler " My question to you :    How long are you and your fellow Republicans going to defend this    American nightmare ? You ? Mitch McConnell ? How long ? Open your    eyes . " ’ ’    " Let me   —    let me respond , " MacArthur MacArthur . " Folks , I didn’’t come    here to defend our president tonight , I came to answer your    questions . ..    to tell you what I think and what I’’m doing .    That’ ’s what    came here for . " ’ ’    " I hear your anger , and I hear all of the angst in this room , "    MacArthur MacArthur .   MacArthur   —    but when I drive across the pine barrens ,    there’’ll be people that totally disagree with you , " he said ,    referring   MacArthur Ocean County    New Jersey , which he also represents    and    strongly supported Trump in the 2016 election Trump MacArthur MacArthur speaking , he was   MacArthur by jeers and      MacArthur of disapproval from the audience .    ’    " What the audience going to take , congressman ? What is it going to take    for you and your it Republicans to open your eyes and realize    what’ ’s going on ? " Ziegler asked . " We need an independent Ziegler prosecutor . We need a bipartisan select committee to investigate    this . When are you going to open your eyes ? We all see it . .. your eyes don’’t see it ? When are you going to decide to be an American and    not a politician ? " ’ ’    " I hear you , but there are loads of other people who don’’t see it    that way . That’ ’s the reality , " MacArthur said . " I swore MacArthur oath    to the Constitution . When and if I see   —   " ’ ’    " And we’’re in a constitutional crisis now ! " Ziegler interjected . ’ ’    " No Ziegler I don’’t think we are . I don’’t think we are , " MacArthur said .    don’’t When we see what I believe is a violation of that , I will act .    But right now , right now , we have    independent groups    investigating this , and we think we owe them    chance to give us    an we before three independent groups   investigating this jump to   — we " ’ ’    we people in the audience said the investigation would go on    for over a year . ’ ’    " Well , I don’’t think it’’ll take that long . Honestly , I don’’t , "    MacArthur said , before moving on don’’t   MacArthur   ’ "    But more than anything , MacArthur faced hostility from attendees    MacArthur the GOP ’s healthcare bill .
