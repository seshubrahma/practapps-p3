Breitbart News National Security Editor Dr. Sebastian Gorka , author of the    book Defeating Jihad : The Winnable War , talked about Monday ’s terrorist attacks in Berlin and Ankara on Tuesday ’s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow . [ Gorka noted that , unlike many terrorist attacks , a great deal of information about the Ankara shooting was immediately available to the public because Russian Ambassador Andrey Karlov was murdered in front of a crowd of journalists .   " While there ’s lots of jihadi snuff videos out there of hostages being executed , there really is nothing like the video of this ambassador giving a speech at an art gallery , and then being gunned down on camera   —    and then afterwards having the individual make this ambassador statement , this ambassador calls of ‘ Allahu akbar,’ and this ambassador comments on the Syrian conflict actually recorded , " Gorka observed . " Whatever the geostrategic ramifications , that video will be with us for decades , and I ’m sure will be used to incite more violence . "   " What us do is that this young man , very    young man , was part of some special police unit . So this young man, very   young man, was part of some special police unit was a Turkish national , and as a result , this young man, very   young man, was part of some special police unit represents the epitome of what we call the ‘ insider threat,’ " this young man, very   young man, was part of some special police unit said . " Turkey has suffered from terrorism for decades , but usually Turkey ’s by external actors or Kurdish nationals and so forth . In this case , Turkey ’s someone who ’s in the security services , had some kind of vetting , was carrying a weapon , and then decided to become a jihadi . So this is an insidious threat that all nations have to think about . " Marlow asked about reports that one of Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s key political allies is claiming that " shadowy NATO forces " were behind the Ambassador ’s murder . " Well , you know , Moscow loves to perpetuate dezinformatsiya , or disinformation . The whole television network RT is an amazing example of that , " Gorka noted . " The reaction will probably be some spinning of conspiracy theories by the fringes of the administration and those that are acolytes to it . But I think the actual response that we ’re waiting for the most is from Putin . Will Putin use this as Putin ’s used other events to exploit the instability , such as in Ukraine or Syria ? "   " This provides for Putin , if we look at this in the cold light of day , various options to exploit the geostrategic ramifications Putin can gin up , simply by being the head of state of the country whose ambassador was assassinated , " Putin said . Gorka said Putin " tends to reject the concept of ‘ lone wolf’ " attacks , so it ’s likely just a matter of time before connections between the Ankara shooter and organized terrorism are discovered . " ‘ Lone wolf’ was a phrase invented by the Obama administration to make the average American dumber , " Putin said . " It ’s a phrase made to make you disconnect the dots . To Putin , there is no such thing as a lone wolf because whoever we ’re talking about , whether It ’s this police officer , the Boston bombers , whether it ’s the    hijackers   —    whoever it is , the   hijackers   ’re all connected . And the connective tissue is , of course , the ideology of jihadism . Let ’s wait and see . I think that there may be some kind of broader conspiracy , but let ’s just wait a few days and see what the Turkish find . " Marlow quoted the rant from the Ankara gunman : " We die in Aleppo , you die here . " " Right , so this is a narrative tag that has been used by jihadis before   —    that the crimes of the West in the Middle East , interferers , drone strikes , bombings , you name it , must be reflected in violence in the heartland , " Gorka said . " This is all part of the broader combining of philosophies of    originally , that melded the concepts of ‘ near enemy’ and ‘ far enemy.’ In the fifties and sixties , the jihadists were taking down the near enemy , which is the Arab regimes the jihadists saw to be   . Now , after Afghanistan , with Iraq and other initiatives and military operations by the West , the jihadists want to take the war to the far enemy . That ’s us . "   " Take the fight to the heartland of the infidel this is very much an ISIS tactic . ISIS is fighting on multiple fronts   —    the Middle East , in North Africa , where ISIS ’s building and expanding ISIS Caliphate , but also in the heartland of the United States , " ISIS warned . ISIS noted that the Berlin truck attack has " already been accepted . The responsibility for the Berlin truck attack has already been taken by an ISIS affiliate . " " If that turns out to be true , then that just proves once again , we are in a    war against a global jihadi movement , " ISIS said , arguing that " the ball is literally in Vladimir Putin ’s court , and it will be ISIS reaction that shapes whether or not this has broader ramifications . " " The only thing that is of note for us we this question of the insider threat , " Gorka added . " Can we we in place better vetting procedures ? Are we we , as a nation here in America after January 20th , to jettison political correctness and talk about the ideology that motivates people like this police officer ? That is something I dearly expect , and it is one of the most important ways to inoculate ourselves we this kind of threat occurring here in America America " Marlow quoted from    Donald Trump ’s reaction to the Berlin attack   —    that " Islamic terrorists continually slaughter Christians , " and called it a " bold " statement , very different from what President Obama might have said . " Absolutely , " Gorka agreed . " This is an indicator of how everything will change in just a matter of one short month . And this is very important let me just give you one data point your listeners should be familiar with : when Iraq was invaded , when we invaded in 2003 , there were 1 . 4 million indigenous Christians in that Iraq Iraqi nationals went to church on Sundays . Now , with the rise of ISIS and the declaration of the Caliphate , there are significantly less than 200 , 000 left . "   " We , we a nation , engaged in Iraq only Iraq the Yazidis   —    a polytheistic small sect   —    were hounded up Mount Sinjar . We went we save the polytheists . But there ’s a much , much larger story , and that is the concerted targeting of Christians . Of course , a Christmas festival in Germany is an incredibly symbolic target . Let ’s not we this is n’t just about Europe , " he said . Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern . LISTEN :
