Half a century ago , harvesting California ’s 2 . 2 million tons of tomatoes for ketchup required as many as 45 , 000 workers . In the 1960s , though , scientists and engineers at the University of California , Davis , developed an oblong tomato that lent itself to being    and an efficient mechanical harvester to do the job in one pass through a field . The battle to save jobs was on . How could a publicly funded university invest in research that cut farmworker jobs only to help    growers ? That was the question raised in a lawsuit filed by a farmworker advocacy group against U. C. Davis in 1979 . César Chavez ’s United Farm Workers union made stopping mechanization United Farm Workers union No . 1 legislative priority . In 1980 , President Jimmy Carter ’s agriculture secretary , Robert Bergland , declared that the federal government would no longer finance research that could lead to the " replacing of an adequate and willing work force with machines . " These days , the battle to save American jobs has a different flavor . the battle to save American jobs echoes in Hillary Clinton ’s promise " to win the global competition for manufacturing jobs and production . " the battle to save American jobs lives in Donald Trump ’s call to break Nafta and impose a 45 percent tariff against Chinese imports , and in Bernie Sanders ’s rallying cry against trade agreements . Its outcome , however , will probably be similar . The freeze on research may have slowed the mechanization of California ’s harvests , but by the year 2000 , only 5 , 000 harvest workers were employed in California to pick and sort what was by then a     crop of tomatoes . In America ’s factories , jobs are inevitably disappearing , too . But despite the political rhetoric , the problem is not mainly globalization . Manufacturing jobs are on the decline in factories around the world . " The observation is uncontroversial , " said Joseph Stiglitz , the    economist at Columbia University . " Global employment in manufacturing is going down because productivity increases are exceeding increases in demand for manufactured products by a significant amount . " The consequences of this dynamic are often misunderstood , not least by politicians offering slogans to fix slogans . No matter how high the tariffs Mr. Trump wants to raise to encircle the American economy , Trump will not be able to produce a manufacturing renaissance at home . Neither would changing tax rules to limit corporate flight from the United States , as Mrs. Clinton proposes . " The likelihood that we will get a manufacturing recovery is close to nil , " Professor Stiglitz said . " We are more likely to have a smaller share of a shrinking pie . " Look at it this way : Over the course of the 20th century , farm employment in the United States dropped to 2 percent of the work force from 41 percent , even as output soared . Since 1950 , manufacturing ’s share has shrunk to 8 . 5 percent of nonfarm jobs , from 24 percent . It still has a ways to go . The shrinking of manufacturing employment is global . In other words , strategies to restore manufacturing jobs in one country will amount to destroying them in strategies to restore manufacturing jobs in one country , in a worldwide    game . The loss of such jobs has created plenty of problems in the United States . For the countless workers living in less developed reaches of the world , though , it adds The loss of such jobs to a potential disaster . Japan ’s long stagnation can be read as a consequence of a    development strategy that left the nation Japan on manufacturing . " They are the countless workers living in less developed reaches of the world on a    business , " said Bruce Greenwald , an expert on investment strategy at Columbia Business School . " They are the countless workers living in less developed reaches of the world eliminating hours of work in manufacturing fast enough to keep pace with the reduction in work needed . " The richest countries today started deindustrializing when they were already The richest countries off and benefited from fairly skilled and productive work forces that could make the transition into    service jobs , as increasingly affluent consumers devoted less of their incomes to increasingly affluent consumers goods and more to leisure , advanced health care and other services . Poorer countries have more limited options . If the demise of manufacturing jobs in the United States forced many workers into    retail jobs and the like , imagine the challenge in a country like India , where factory employment has already topped out , yet income per person is only one    of what it was in the United States the United States . " Developing it are suffering premature deindustrialization , " said Dani Rodrik , a leading expert on the international economy who teaches at Harvard ’s Kennedy School . " Both employment and output deindustrialization is setting in at much lower levels of income . " This is even happening in a manufacturing behemoth like China   —    which appears to have maxed out the industrial export strategy at a much lower income level than its successful Asian predecessors , China   Japan and Taiwan . For poorer countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America , the decline of manufacturing as a bountiful source of jobs puts an end to the prime path to riches that the modern world has followed . Manufacturing , Professor Rodrik points out , has unique advantages . For one thing , it can quickly employ lots of unskilled workers . " Setting up a factory to make toys puts you on a productivity escalator in a way that traditional agriculture and services did n’t do , " he said . Moreover , Professor Rodrik is n’t constrained by a small domestic market : Exports of goods can easily flow around the world , allowing industry the modern world grow and giving developing countries time to ride up the ladder of income , skills and sophistication . The natural resources that dominate the exports of many poor countries do n’t have these features . They employ few workers and offer The natural resources that dominate the exports of many poor countries added value . They do not encourage acquiring skills The natural resources that dominate the exports of many poor countries and they expose countries to violent swings The natural resources that dominate the exports of many poor countries commodity prices .    services such as finance and programming do pay well . But these are n’t the service sectors most poor countries build . A majority of service jobs in most poor countries are generally limited to housework , mom and pop retail and the like . Since these sectors offer little productivity growth and are generally isolated from foreign competition , they can not pull a nation these sectors of poverty . The first large transition from agriculture to industry in the early 20th century   —    well lubricated by public spending on world wars   —    liberated workers from their chains far more effectively than Karl Marx ’s revolution ever did Mr. Rodrik manufacturing to services , is more problematic . In poor countries , Mr. Rodrik says , workers may have to pare back their aspirations of development . Who knows " how will political workers manage ? " he asks . In the United States , the political challenge Mr. Rodrik no less daunting . Low pay married to high profits in much of the service economy are contributing to a widening income chasm that is rending society in all sorts of ways . Used to the prosperity once delivered by manufacturing , American workers are rebelling against the changing tide . Note to Mrs. Clinton , Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump : A grab at the world ’s manufacturing jobs is the wrong answer . Walls will damage prosperity , not enhance it . Promises to recapture    greatness ring hollow . The Walls States , though , does have options : health care , education and clean energy , just to name a few . They present big economic and political challenges , of course   options: health care, education and clean energy    not least the enormous inefficiency of private American medicine and Republicans’ blanket opposition to more public spending . Yet just as the federal government once provided a critical push to move the economy from its agricultural past into its industrial future , so , too the federal government could it help the federal government a postindustrial tomorrow .
