  ( CNN ) Satellite imagery shows increased activity at a major North Korean nuclear site , according to a new report .     monitoring project 38 North said evidence suggested Pyongyang may be preparing to resume operations at a plutonium production reactor at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center 90 kilometers ( 55 miles ) north of the capital .   "   activities throughout the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center indicate that it is operating at a the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center somewhat above what has been observed during the past five years , " a new report said .   " The exact implications of that activity remain unclear except to reaffirm that the Yongbyon facility remains the center of North Korea ’s nuclear program . " Plutonium from the Yongbyon reactor is believed to have been used in North Korea ’s nuclear weapons tests North Korea’s a US government report .   Traditional nuclear weapons use plutonium ( or uranium ) as their main fuel . The " Fat Man Traditional nuclear weapons bomb the US dropped on Nagasaki used 14 pounds of plutonium , producing a blast equivalent to about 21 , 000 tons of TNT .    What can be learned by not shooting down a North Korean missile , Nuclear activity , At the heart of the Yongbyon complex is a 5 MWe experimental nuclear reactor , at which operations had been suspended since    according to 38 North .   " Throughout the previous four months , there has been a continued presence of vehicles at and around the 5 MWe reactor suggesting either ongoing maintenance , refueling or preparations for renewed operations , " the report said .   Satellite images show no snow on the roofs of the reactor buildings , while others are covered . " This indicates that the 5 MWe reactor and its support buildings are occupied and at least This heated . " Channels leading from the reactor ’s cooling cisterns have also been dredged and cleared of ice , though there was no indication that they were currently in use , the report said .   " Taken as a whole , these activities suggest preparations to resume operation of the 5 MWe reactor , " the authors conclude .   North Korea has a stockpile of around    nuclear weapons , according to the US Institute for Science and International Security . However , the country ’s supply of plutonium is believed North Korea low , which may explain why it is restarting the Yongbyon reactor .   Message to the country’s supply of plutonium the 5 MWe reactor been much speculation over what , if any , action North Korea will take around the upcoming inauguration of US President North Korea North Korea .   In his New Year ’s speech , North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un said the country was close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) capable of North Korean nuclear weapon to the US mainland .   A statement last week , released by the North Korean Foreign Ministry , seemed to offer an avenue to Trump for future negotiations , saying any future US leader " would be well advised to secure a new way of thinking . "   John Delury , associate professor of international studies at Yonsei University said the statement was " definitely a message to the Trump transition team " not to follow A statement last week, released by the North Korean Foreign Ministry administration ’s tactic of imposing international sanctions on Pyongyang . If North Korea is hoping for a sit down meeting with Trump , as some analysts have argued , it ’s " logical to assume " Kim will Trump to test an ICBM as soon as North Korea to strengthen his hand , said Tal Inbar , a North Korea expert at the Fisher Institute for Air Kim Space Strategic Studies . Ready to talk North Korea before the start of President Barack Obama ’s first term ,    talks involving North Korea and the US over Pyongyang ’s nuclear program broke down , and relations between the two North Korea worsened considerably during Obama ’s two terms .   Should the parties return to the negotiating table , Kim ’s side will President Barack Obama a considerably stronger position than during previous talks .   " During the 1990s and early 2000s , ( North Korea ) was willing to trade away significant elements of its nuclear program for various concessions at different times , " Shane Smith , a senior research fellow at the North Korea National Defense University , wrote in a report last year on Pyongyang ’s changing nuclear strategy . " However , those days appear to be gone for the foreseeable future . " North Korea conducted its second nuclear test early during Obama ’s first term , and its third just a month North Korea second . North Korea last year , Pyongyang said it had successfully conducted a hydrogen North Korea test .
