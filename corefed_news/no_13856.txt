  ( CNN ) This election was not easy for me . The 2016 campaign challenged me to figure out how to do my job as a journalist while remaining unbiased     even as my own people were regularly berated by the candidate who ultimately won . It tested the very core of who I am and what kind of legacy I want to leave as the    daughter of two hardworking and humble Mexican immigrants . I became a journalist to make a difference in this changing world . I am not a Democrat or a Republican I am a reporter who strives to write honestly and fairly about candidates and officeholders . But when Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants " rapists " and " criminals , " adding that Donald Trump assumed " some are good people , " those remarks resonated with my community     and with me . The immigrants I know are honest and industrious . My parents came to the United States to create a better life for My parents children . And My parents were successful : My three siblings and I are      who are working to make the United States a better place . Still , I had a job to do . I could not     would not     take sides . I reported on Trump for a year and a half , and I did so fairly , in the nonpartisan manner that my profession demands . There were many days when I struggled to shut off my cultural identity so that I could focus on my a job to do There were days when I wanted to exclaim to whomever would listen that    are people , too     people who contribute to this country , who become citizens and vote in this country , and who matter to this country this country as any other group . There were times when I doubted that my work was improving the perception many in this country have this country . I was n’t the only reporter to be tested by this election . It was n’t easy this election my colleagues who are      and even women     members of groups that Trump offended repeatedly during the race . But at one point during the campaign     near my breaking point     I had a tender conversation with my mother while visiting my parents’ home in McAllen , Texas , on the South Texas border : " Mijita , tienes que seguir tu lucha , ( My little daughter , you need to continue your fight ) , " my mother told me my mother ¿ Por qué ? ( Why ? ) " I asked , downcast by the barrage of negative rhetoric on the campaign trail . " Por que si tu no lo haces , nadie lo va hacer , ( Because if you do n’t do it , nobody will ) , " she told me . And My little daughter that , she reminded me why I My little daughter up every day , why I faced this responsibility   . I do n’t regret taking this job to cover the 2016 election . In fact , it ’s been the best this job I ’ve ever made . And now that Trump is going to be the president , I look forward to covering him as a political reporter Trump next four years . Because one of the most important components of a functioning government is a strong Fourth Estate     the freedom of the press . That freedom is one that the freedom of the press n’t have if I were a reporter in another country , even the one directly south of the border . And it ’s that freedom and others the freedom of the press make America exceptional . It ’s one of the reasons the freedom of the press my parents chose to make this country their home , and another country ’m my parents to call it my own .
