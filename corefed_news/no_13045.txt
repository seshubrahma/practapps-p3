During an interview with NPR ’s " Fresh Air " released on Thursday , New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet stated " we did not have a handle on just how much anxiety there was in America . And we did not have a handle on just how much just how much anxiety was going to drive the election . " And " the New    and    too , probably , media powerhouses do n’t quite get religion . "   New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet said , [ relevant remarks begin around 28:30 ] " we wrote a lot of stories about anxiety in America . we even did a series called ‘ Anxious America.’ But we did not have a handle on just how much anxiety there was in the country America we did not have a handle on just how much that anxiety was just how much anxiety drive the election .    …      I could pull out 25 stories that would prove the point that we wrote about it . But I would be dishonest if I did n’t say those stories did n’t quite add up to a powerful portrait of an angry electorate , an electorate that just wanted change . So , yeah , I think that ’s a story we could have done better . By the way , I think even Donald Trump was surprised by the level of that anxiety in the country , everybody was . But , I ’m answering for me . " He added , " even Donald Trump want to make sure that we are much more creative about beats out in the country , so the country understand that anger and disconnectedness that people feel . I think I use religion as an example because I was raised Catholic in New Orleans . I think that the New    and    too , probably , media powerhouses do n’t quite get religion . we have a fabulous religion writer , but she ’s all alone . a fabulous religion writer do n’t get religion . we do n’t get the role of religion in people ’s lives . And I think we can do much , much better . And I think there are things that we can be more creative about to understand the country . " (   Mediaite ) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
