Host Andrea Mitchell asked , " But in this case , do you think Republican presidential   Donald Trump has a point , that it ’s fair game if she Republican presidential   Donald Trump going to make women ’s issues an issue and if he Republican presidential   Donald Trump a surrogate for her Republican presidential   Donald Trump is it fair game to go after Hillary Clinton as well as Bill Hillary Clinton his past Hillary Clinton ? " Panetta said , " You know what , I would like to hear from Donald Trump a little bit of the substance of what the hell he ’s Donald Trump about . He ’s Donald Trump a lot of comments about how easy it is to deal with ISIS , how easy it is to deal with a lot of the challenges that are out there . But I have n’t heard the substance behind it . it think that ’s what we ought to be hearing more about . You know , personal issues , other issues , I know campaigns are going to get involved in those kinds of debates , but from the perspective of the American people , I think they need campaigns hear what kind of substance , what kind of details , is the president going to actually provide as president of the United States , that ’s something we ’re not getting enough of .
