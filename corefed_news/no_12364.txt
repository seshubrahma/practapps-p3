You have the first attack on our country , acknowledged , since Trumps ’s been elected , and Trumps ’s not responded like a patriot yet . Now , that is very disturbing . Now , you guys keep wanting to point out that Obama did this and Trumps did that , oh , and when   —    Van , when   Trump gets here   Trump ’s going to do x , y , and z. The reality is ,   Trump talks all the time .   Trump ’s speaking tonight .   Trump tweets like my children do , and   Trump ’s not spoken like a patriot yet .
