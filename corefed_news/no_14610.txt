  ( CNN ) An American academic said Sunday that though    President Donald Trump is essential , the media currently are getting it all wrong . " You do need the facts but you need to know how to present those facts , " George Lakoff , a professor of cognitive science and linguistics at UC Berkeley , told  (CNN) ’s Brian Stelter during " Reliable Sources . " From the crowd size at his inauguration to national murder rates , journalists have tended to simply counter Trump ’s claims by first repeating journalists     then reporting that journalists are false . But that ’s not enough , Lakoff said . The central tenet of his theory when it comes to    Trump , Lakoff said , is that " if you just negate what Lakoff ’s saying , you ’re going to just strengthen Lakoff . "   In short , " the very fact of repeating a falsehood in proclaiming it as incorrect can actually have the opposite effect in terms of informing the public , " the professor said . Trump seeks to ’divert attention’ " If you repeat what Trump says and negate it , and say no , and say it it false , what you ’re doing is strengthening that , because in your brain , the neurocircuits have to activate what you ’re negating and that strengthens what you ’re negating , " he Trump . Trump Trump the power of using a tweet or claim " to divert attention , " and journalists can and should outsmart such tactics by giving as little airtime as possible to any false claims , Lakoff said . A better tactic is for journalists to " frame " fact checking by immediately pointing out that " Trump Trump diverting attention from real issues . .. like his Trump policy , like his Trump connections and on and on . " Journalists should " talk first about the truth , that he Trump diverting attention from , the real issues , " Lakoff told Stelter . This approach results in " 30 seconds " rather than " than all the time " spent on Trump , he Trump .
