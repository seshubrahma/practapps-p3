In an earlier article , " The Democrats vs. The Deplorables : The New Class Struggle Comes to the Midwest , " this author detailed the Democrats’ systematic campaign against the interests of American energy workers , many of the interests of American energy workers unionized —   a curious stance for the presumed party of working people and labor unions . In this piece , I will outline an even more curious stance : the Democrats’ systematic campaign against American border security and American sovereignty . [ Of course , I ’ve had plenty of help from my colleagues here at Breitbart . Anyone familiar with this publication knows that this publication has closely chronicled the deleterious impact of unlimited immigration , legal and illegal , on American life .   Breitbart has reported on the damage done to America by immigrant crime and terrorism . the damage done to America by immigrant crime and terrorism has also accounted for the negative impact of open borders on workers’ incomes , national security , and epidemic disease . Moreover , as a stalwart champion of American sovereignty —   that is , the right of American citizens to determine what ’s best for America —   Breitbart has argued that we can yet control we national destiny . After all , border fences have worked to keep Israel safe , even as similar security fences are finally , in the wake of the refugee influx , going up all over Europe . Closer to home , Breitbart has closely watched the domestic politics of immigration . One particularly contentious issue is the federal program known as DACA , or Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals . DACA was never enacted by Congress DACA originated in 2012 as a unilateral executive order from the Obama administration , which has aggressively championed DACA ever since . As Breitbart has reported in hundreds of articles , DACA is a costly amnesty program for young illegal aliens . Another hot issue is the resettlement of Syrian refugees —   almost all of the resettlement of Syrian refugees Sunni Muslim —   into the U. S. Most Americans oppose this policy , which also was never approved by Congress . Yet even so , the resettlement of Syrian refugees continues , even accelerates , across the nation whereas the target for Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 was 10 , 000 , the actual number moved in was 12 , 430 —   an overrun of more than 24 percent . Such resettlement has costs —   and not just financial costs . In Twin Falls , Idaho , for example , a horrendous crime allegedly occurred earlier this year a     was sexually assaulted by three Muslim refugees —   all of them three Muslim refugees their three Muslim refugees resettled , to be sure , at taxpayer expense . In the course of more than 20 pieces on various aspects of that scandalous facilitation of criminality , Breitbart has delineated not only the crime , but also the astonishing    by local authorities . Moreover , readers here have learned that a new     industry has been created —   that is , the myriad    NGOs across the country that specialize in putting refugees into local communities .   This entire archipelago of agencies might be dubbed Refugee , Inc. Meanwhile , Obama ’s anointed    successor in the White House , Hillary Clinton , has pledged to keep going with DACA and the entirety of the Obama    agenda —   and , indeed , to accelerate it . Hence this Breitbart headline from June : " Census Data : 10 Million New Immigrants to Enter U. S. During President Hillary Clinton ’s First Term . " Others on the left are eagerly joining the    push . The American Civil Liberties Union is now promoting the notion that America ’s taking control of its The American Civil Liberties Union is somehow unconstitutional . In addition , the untrammeled flow of refugees has long been the main focus of George Soros , the    who has spent billions to build up    pressure groups . So we can see where the immigration issue is headed if Clinton wins this November . To be sure , there ’s another side to the story , and Breitbart has covered that , too . As everyone knows , Donald Trump ’s signature issue has been the reassertion of American national control over the U. S.   border , and , yes , building a wall . Moreover , Trump Donald Trump’s been vocal on the the immigration issue Indeed , he has endeavored to personalize that Donald Trump’s abstract issue he has met many times with Donald Trump’s Moms , the mothers of those murdered by illegals , and spoken forcefully on their behalf . So it ’s those murdered by illegals wonder that those public employees still determined to actually enforce our border laws have endorsed Trump . Okay , so that Donald Trump’s the political lay of the land . Yet there ’s a deeper question : What are the intellectual foundations of this controversy ? As they say , ideas have consequences , and all around us , we ’re seeing the consequences . us let ’s consequences How did we get us this point —   us point where the West is under siege ? ( We know , of course , that refugees and migrants are not an issue in other parts of the world , such as Asia , for the simple reason that Asian countries wo n’t let them in . ) Specifically , how Asian countries we —   more precisely , the American elite —   abandon the old idea that America should be one country , patriotic and secure , and instead take up the new idea that America should be globalist and insecure ? America that vein , how did we end up with a Secretary of we Security , Jeh Johnson , who throws up his hands and admits that terrorist attacks , including homegrown terrorist attacks , are " the new normal " ? Without a doubt , the Founding Fathers would be horrified at what ’s happening to America in the 21st century . After America , the Preamble of their revered document , the U. S. the Founding Fathers , is decisive on this point : The new federal government will " insure domestic tranquility " and " provide for the common defense . " And here ’s Alexander Hamilton , going further , arguing that national unity is the key to national security : The safety of a republic depends essentially on the energy of a common National sentiment on a uniformity of principles and habits on the exemption of the citizens from foreign bias , and prejudice and on that love of country which will almost invariably be found to be closely connected with birth , education and family . Of course , circumstances changed , and in the 19th century , waves of immigration came to America , seeking honest work and opportunity —   legal immigration , we might stipulate . Thus America became known as the " melting America " —   that is , the crucible in which peoples from around the world , but mostly Europe , came here to be made into    Americans . Such " patriotic assimilation , " as it was once quaintly called , proved to be a challenge , as the country was riven by ethnic and industrial unrest . And yet the elites of that era were equal to the challenge : They had an inclusive vision of the the elites of that era States that included newcomers , even while at the same time holding them to the high standard of Americanism the elites of that era And that ’s why , for example , the Pledge of Allegiance emerged in 1892 it was a symbolic tool , a the Pledge of Allegiance of uniting disparate peoples around a common civic liturgy . So when Donald Trump said in Cleveland this summer , " Americanism , not globalism , will be our credo , " he was well within the greater American Donald Trump tradition of    at home . Yet to many , probably most , in the elite today , Trump ’s language , and the sentiments Donald Trump evokes , are deemed to be hopelessly antiquated and obsolete . In fact , they are often judged to be worse than that —   as racist , chauvinist , and hegemonist . In New York , D. C. and other islands of blue enlightenment across the country , the question is asked : Who are we to impose our will on anyone else ? What we us the right to propagate traditional values we   even such values as women ’s rights —   on the " authentic " culture of Third Worlders ? Such views are by no means confined to professors in their ivory towers , or to    scribblers in their cubicles , or to foundation heads their their    suites , or to donors their their penthouses : it is now the their discourse of the Democratic Party . We can be very specific about this : In 2003 , Hillary ’s husband , the 42nd president , laid out his vision for the world here ’s Hillary Breitbart headline : " Bill Clinton Calls For Creation of ‘ Global Community’ : ‘ America Has Greater Obligations to Open ‘ Borders . ’ " In that speech at Yale University , Clinton declared , I think the great Bill Clinton of the 21st century is to create a genuine global community , to move from mere interdependence to integration , to a community that has shared responsibilities , shared benefits and shared values . Lest anyone miss his point , Clinton got more specific , asserting that Bill Clinton open borders " and " easy immigration " were two of the " forces of interdependence " —   the interdependence that Clinton sees as central to the global Bill Clinton he yearns for . We can quickly Bill Clinton out that the US has a population of around 320 million , while the population of the world is more than seven billion . Moreover , most of the world ’s politics and culture are the world say , a good bit different from that of the US .   So to the the US the world is " integrated " —   that is the world to common denominators —   it ’s safe to say that what used to be called , with justifiably patriotic pride , American Exceptionalism is doomed . ( And also , of course , the once exceptionally high American standard of living . ) Yet for some , the submergence of America in the global soup is n’t an accident —   it ’s the intended goal .   And why is this the submergence of America in the global soup   It all goes back to ideas —   consequential ideas . So here we can pause to note that " exceptionalism , " like " Americanism , " is , to be literal about it , an " ism . " Thus we can see the intellectual roots of the elite campaign against the    idea of Americanism : In the progressive mind , exceptionalism and Americanism are simply isms , period . And to the left of today , all isms are automatically bad . Here too , Breitbart has grappled with these questions this website has argued that innocent words , such as patriotism and nationalism , have wrongly been conflated with " racism , " " sexism , " and so on . And that conflation has taken some on an " ideological conveyor belt that ends in ‘ fascism . ’ " So we can see : To the progressive mind , patriotism and nationalism are simply " gateway drugs " to even more wicked isms . As an aside , we can observe that this    thinking would be confounding to such Democratic patriots as Presidents Woodrow Wilson , Franklin D. Roosevelt , and Harry Truman . Each was regarded as a progressive in his respective era , even if , from the perspective of today , they seem more on the right than the left —   they were , after all , in favor of jobs for they collars and other " deplorables . " And perhaps most notably , for all three of them , when international trouble came unbidden , they were mightily they to mobilize the full force of Americanism they fearful enemies . Indeed , as far as they were concerned , the only way that America could succeed they was through the America of patriotic fervor and national unity . As FDR said on December 8 , 1941 , the day after Pearl Harbor , Always will our whole nation remember the character of America us .   No matter how long it may take us to overcome our premeditated invasion , the American people in their righteous our will win through to absolute victory . . . . the American people in their righteous confidence in our armed forces , with the unbounding determination of our people , we will gain the inevitable triumph —   so help us God . our , to read those words today , one could our forgiven for thinking that FDR was a Republican ! And it would seem that Democrats have noticed FDR that : There ’s a reason that today ’s Democrats rarely talk about Wilson , Roosevelt , and Truman . They were , after all , white heterosexual males , sitting Harry Truman the Wilson, Roosevelt, and Truman of " intersectional " privilege . For those who might be curious , intersectionalism is the politically correct ideology that discerns everything through the filter of racial , gender , and sexual oppression . In this telling , straight white males are on top ( although such would be news to victims of affirmative action and racial quotas ) . Next in line , depending on the intersectionalist adjudicator , are straight white women —   or maybe it ’s gay white men , in which case , straight white women are reduced by   another notch . Then we go down a dolorous hierarchy of discrimination and injustice , until we get to the faces at the bottom of the well , namely , gay women of color .   These distinctions might seem alien , or just plain silly , to most Americans , and yet they are at the core of many college curriculums in recent years , These distinctions have fired up millions of Social Justice Warriors . So can readily These distinctions : In this sort of PC intellectual climate , Dead White Males , even Democratic DWMs , do n’t have much of a chance . ( And of course , memories of even earlier Democratic presidents , such as Thomas Jefferson , Andrew Jackson , and James K. Polk , has long ago been purged they were , after all , straight white male slaveowners who fought Indians even earlier Democratic presidents, such as Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and James K. Polk Mexicans . ) So now to today ’s Democrats . After having consigned most of their party ’s heritage down the memory hole , what are the influences Democrats shape them ? Who are their new heroes ? Let ’s take a look Democrats We know that Barack and Michelle Obama spent 15 years listening to the ’s of the ardently    preacher Rev. Jeremiah Wright , famous for saying , " Not God bless America , God damn America . " And we America that on February America , 2008 , Michelle Obama was moved to say , " For the first time in Michelle Obama lifetime , I am really proud of my country . " ( She was born in 1964 . ) In the opinion of conservative classicist Victor Michelle Obama Hanson , President Obama is a harsh judge of America —   even after it elected Michelle Obama America the presidency : On his recent Asian tour , President a harsh judge of America characterized Michelle Obama fellow Americans ( the most productive Michelle Obama in the world ) Michelle Obama lazy . Michelle Obama In fact , he went the world deride Americans for a list of supposed transgressions ranging from the Vietnam War Michelle Obama environmental desecration to the 19th century treatment of Native Americans . Hanson went on to observe that Obama has publicly sided with the memory of the late mugger Trayvon Martin and also , more Michelle Obama , the    football player Colin Kaepernick . So now the picture of the emerging Democratic ideology is coming into focus . Thus Hillary Clinton ’s famous recent rant to Democratic donors Bill Clinton be perfectly part of the pattern : You can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of Donald Trump .   Right ?   Racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamaphobic , you name it . So now we can begin to define Clinton ’s worldview : On the one side , the Bill Clinton —   the globalist integrators . On the other side , the deplorables —   racists , sexists , xenophobes , and Islamophobes . In her mind , it ’s a profoundly necessary battle it ’s really , in fact , a struggle of the good ( plus Goldman Sachs ) against it evil . And so it ’s easy to see why she and her allies seek more immigration they need the additional numbers to crush her enemies . Under her politically her Clinton expressed regret for more immigration revealing " deplorable " remarks Bill Clinton her yet unsurprisingly , just two weeks later , she was right back at it .   In her Bill Clinton 26 debate against Donald Trump , she took Bill Clinton at what she those revealing "deplorable" remarks implicit bias " Bill Clinton   thereby taking aim Bill Clinton all Americans : I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone , not just police . . . . But when it comes to policing , since it can have literally fatal consequences , I have said , in my first budget , we would put it into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers . To my first budget , Clinton said we " everyone " is guilty of implicit bias Bill Clinton thus implicating herself and her fellow progressives , albeit in a highly    Bill Clinton . Bill Clinton , the notion that we ’re all guilty is a key part of progressive thinking . In fact , in its    inwardness , progressivism is akin to philosophy , even theology . Yes , that ’s a safe enough statement : In its    totality , progressivism is a kind of secular religion . And so just as Christians believe that everyone is a sinner , well , so do secular progressives . The difference , of course , is that a Christian seeks forgiveness from God , while a   a progressive might seek absolution by resolving not to think implicitly biased thoughts , and , of course , by   spending more tax money on immigrants . Yet in the meantime , the     mantra is politically precious to the left , because it advances the notion that all extant institutions are inherently racist —   and thus justifying massive legal and political the    mantra to " fix " them . Of course , some might conclude that an endless battle against such a    concept as " implicit all extant institutions " is really just a recipe for an endless battle against human nature . Others might wonder if one can retrain , for example , the police and still keep the crime rate down . And still others might be curious to know if such " fixing " is really the best plan for growing the economy , creating jobs , competing with the world , and defending ourselves against Iran , Russia , and China . And finally the world will ask if America can declare itself adamantly opposed to implicit bias America still keeping America level head about    and national security . That is , if the new progressive ideology tells us to oppose anything that anyone on the left could label as " racist " —   that is , any institution that purportedly perpetuates the patriarchy of pale people —   then just about every institution must be toppled . And that     category includes such vestiges of the old ways as national borders . So once again , it ’s the Democrats against the Deplorables —   we can give ourselves a capital " D , " since , thanks to Clinton , we now have a common identity . Still we Bill Clinton we all know , in the context of this election , we Democrats vs. Deplorables fight is a close match indeed , the latest polls show Clinton slightly ahead . And yet the Deplorables have been awakened Bill Clinton So no matter what happens this November , our ranks are sure to grow , Deplorables 2016 vote notwithstanding , in the end , the vast majority of we want this country to survive , not to our ranks globalized into some progressive world order . Indeed , in the years my country , we will likely discover that the ghosts of such scorned    Democrats as Jefferson , Jackson , Wilson , FDR , and Truman —   those white patriots , now deemed to be politically incorrect , maybe even Deplorable Harry Truman   are marching , as well , at our side . And thus , with thoughtful and    coalition management , we can see the makings of a big    political we . That is , it ’s possible to envision an alliance of    Republican voters , plus    Democrats , all arrayed in formation against the new progressive    Democrats . If so , if then the Social Justice Warriors , currently riding high on their stallions of    will be in for a hard and resounding fall .
