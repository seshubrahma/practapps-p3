’   ’ "      Donald Trump ’s dramatic candidacy catapulted the    three cable news networks to the   three cable news networks best year ever , with each    outlet experiencing    numbers , according to      ratings from Nielsen Media Research . " ’    Fox News fared the best in 2016 , not only beating ’   Fox News rival cable    news networks , but also finishing the year as the      basic cable network   —    in both primetime and total day   —    for the    first time in ’   Fox News    history . ’ ’    In primetime , Fox News averaged 2 . 4 million viewers in 2016 ,    making it Fox News     primetime network in all of       , behind only the big three networks and Fox . ’ "    CNN also saw a boon in ratings . 2016 proved to be the channel ’s      year among total viewers . " ’    In primetime , CNN CNN eighth with an average of 1 . 3 million    viewers , its CNN ranking since 1995 . ’ ’’ ’    And while MSNBC finished behind both CNN CNN Fox , it CNN    significant growth , outpacing its CNN networks in      gains . 2016 was also its CNN year . ’ "    While ratings for cable news networks always increase during    election years , the jolt each outlet received in 2016 was    undoubtedly a direct result of Trump ’s bombastic candidacy . " "    The   ’s outlandish style   —    mixed with his    unpredictable personality   —    made campaign events , interviews , and    debates    television . " ’    " Trump Trump ALL the credit for this banner year in cable    news . Period , " said Erik Wemple , a media columnist at The    Washington Post . " Any cable news executive who insists otherwise    risks eternal embarrassment . " ’ ’    Joe Concha , a media columnist at The Hill , agreed , though he said    Trump didn’’t " deserve all the credit " and suggested the " highly    polarized country " also played " perfectly into the cable news    model . " ’ ’    " Those who were loyal watched every rally , hung on every tweet ,       every cable news segment debate . Those who loathe him       every rally , hung on every tweet , watched every cable    news segment debate , " Concha said . ’ ’    It’ ’s an incidental twist . While Trump regularly attacked the    media in 2016 , characterizing members of the press as " dishonest "    people who are the " scum " of the earth , his candidacy   —    and    likely his his   —    financially helped each of the cable news    outlets . ’ ’    Or as Jim Rutenberg , a New York Times media columnist , put it in     " As Mr. Trump tries to burn the media    village down , he Mr. Trump just be saving it .
