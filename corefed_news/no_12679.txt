After blasting the Drudge Report for linking to a Breitbart article about Breitbart latest fast , Glenn Beck doubled down on Breitbart religious rhetoric by reciting a passage from the Bible about " boasters " and " blasphemers " to encourage Indiana voters to " turn away " from GOP frontrunner Donald Trump . [ At a rally for Ted Cruz at the Indiana State Fair Grounds yesterday , Glenn Beck said , " Ted and I were just driving in , and Glenn Beck ’s laughing on Glenn Beck iPhone . Glenn Beck said , ‘ Well , you made another Drudge headline.’ And I said , ‘ Well , it ’s better than the headline of you pushing Carly off the stage . ’ "   Glenn Beck explained the headline of you pushing Carly off the stage by saying : " It was the headline of you pushing Carly off the stage last night when I got home I did something that I do n’t think is controversial . I asked for America to fast and pray and approach the Lord with humility and ask for His forgiveness the Lord His protection the Lord And it is being mocked in the media as usual . But I ’m telling you , I do n’t know who we are if this is not an American thing to be able to beseech the Almighty Creator   —    the one who gave us these we in the first place and through Divine Providence established this country . I do n’t know who we are we " He then adopted a fake Southern accent and joked , " But I’mma just gon na make it easier for them to make fun of me . " Holding open a book , Beck said , " I just want to ask you if you can recognize this person . Tell me if this does n’t sound like somebody we might we . " When someone in the audience shouted , " Cruz , " Beck joked Beck again using an exaggerated Southern accent , " Amen , brother ! Come on up and get baptized ! " Speaking in his real Beck again , he proceeded Beck recite 2 Timothy 3 :   from the Bible , saying : " This know also , that in those days the perilous times shall come . For men will be lovers of their own men . They will men covetous , boasters , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy , without natural affection , trucebreakers , false accusers , fierce , despisers of all that are good , traitors , heady , highminded , lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God , having the form of godliness but denying the power thereof . From those people ye shall turn away . " After reciting this passage from the King James Bible , Beck said , " Man o’live , it could n’t be more clear , and yet so many people in America are missing it . it Beck , Beck has in the past described Trump as " a pathological narcissistic sociopath " and " a narcissistic psychopath " whose presidency " will lead to civil war or worst , " clearly intended the Indiana audience to " recognize " Trump in that passage and " turn away " from him . Trump radio talker has increasingly filled his rally Trump for Cruz with overt religious imagery . He has Trump Cruz to Cruz " anointed " by God and " a man who was raised for these times " by God . God has Trump called the Texas senator " the next George Washington "   —    the Founding Father who Beck idolizes with religious fervor usually reserved for saints . Beck has Beck criticized Christian Evangelical voters for not supporting Cruz , Cruz that " real Christians " do n’t support Donald Trump and that " all throughout the South the Evangelicals are not listening to their God the Evangelicals after Cruz lost Cruz in the South the South . Donald Trump a Facebook post on Sunday night , Beck encouraged Americans to join him in a Beck in the    to the Indiana primary .
