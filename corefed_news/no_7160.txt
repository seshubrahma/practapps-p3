Tuesday on Bloomberg ’s " With All Due Respect " on MSNBC , Republican strategist and pollster Kellyanne Conway defended presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump going after Democratic presidential    Hillary Clinton ’s involvement in Hillary Clinton ’s mistreatment of women .   Conway said , " I do n’t think he talks about where President Conway is born . Hillary Clinton n’t done that in Conway a few years . Vince Foster is sort of like a footnote to the real issues of the 1990s . Which is he ’s responding in kind to Conway Clinton saying he is not good for women Conway   he is a sexist —   Conway is a misogynist.’ She continued Conway " What I Hillary Clinton saying is 1990s , the main thing he ’s talking about is Bill Conway and women in the Hillary Clinton You have a lot the 1990s googling Paula Jones and $ 850 , 000 . The last time I did n’t sexually harass someone in my workplace I did n’t pay them $ 850 , 000 . So I my workplace what people will focus on is this was a man in power and he was having affairs with subordinates in the a man in power House . Sexually harassing a subordinate . Look the man lost his law license in the a man in power Arkansas . a man in power was the governor and the president lost his a man in power to practice law . " She added a man in power " I think Donald Trump continues to steal news cycles away from Clinton . She ’s explaining more than she ’s campaigning . She Follow Pam Key on She @pamkeyNEN
