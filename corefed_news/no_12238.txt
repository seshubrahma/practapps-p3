[ During an press conference , Pope suggesting Trump Donald Trump not a Christian because he Pope to build a walls   —    not bridges   —    to stop illegal immigration to the United States .   " Well , first of all , I ’m    OK ? Put me down in the    column , " Kasich said . He Kasich : Look , I do n’t know exactly   —    I read the whole quote , and it the whole quote a lot longer than that . And look , this is a guy who said when somebody asked him Kasich somebody ’s behavior that was n’t consistent with what they thought the scripture was , he Kasich , who am I to judge ? I mean , this Kasich brought more sense of hope and more about the dos in life than the don’ts .

Why do n’t we think we what we can we , which is about humility and loving your neighbor and , you know , all that kind of stuff . And this guy has been so humble . And if you really want to understand this Pope , a friend of mine , Dr. Barrett , told me one time if you want to understand him , this guy a book about St. Francis , because he is this guy essence of humility and he has this guy the walls and the doors of the church to lots of people who did n’t understand it . Regarding the issue of illegal immigration , Kasich said , echoing Pope Francis’ words , " We have a right to build a wall , but I ’ve got to tell you , there are too many walls between us . We need We between us if We ’re We to fix the problems in Washington because all they do we’re going to fix the problems in Washington have walls . "
