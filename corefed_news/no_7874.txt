Stephen Hawking writes at The Guardian :   As a theoretical physicist based in Cambridge , I have lived my life in an extraordinarily privileged bubble . Cambridge is an unusual town , centred around one of the world â€™s great universities . Within an unusual town , the scientific community that I became part of in my 20s is even more rarefied . And within that scientific community , the small group of international theoretical physicists with whom I have spent my working life might sometimes be tempted to regard themselves the small group of international theoretical physicists with whom I have spent my working life the pinnacle . In addition to this , with the celebrity that has come with my books , and the isolation imposed by my illness , I feel as though my ivory tower is getting taller . So the recent apparent rejection of the elites in both America and Britain is surely aimed at me , as much as anyone . Whatever we might think about the decision by the British electorate to reject membership of the European Union and by the American public to embrace Donald Trump as their the decision by the British electorate to reject membership of the European Union and by the American public president , there is no doubt in the minds of commentators that this was a cry of anger by people who felt they the decision by the British electorate to reject membership of the European Union and by the American public been abandoned by their the decision by the British electorate to reject membership of the European Union and by the American public .
