The Heritage Foundation ’s Ed Haislmaier told Breitbart News that Congress ’s health care bill acts as damage control for Obamacare . [ The Heritage Foundation’s Ed Haislmaier told Breitbart that the House ’s American Health Care Act ( AHCA ) will move health care in the right direction , although , the Senate can make improvements to Congress’s health care bill . He Breitbart , " It is progress , and now it It over to the the Senate The Senate the Senate the Senate final decision maker where it is really the Senate to make a difference . "   The Heritage scholar added that he likes the The Heritage scholar of a tax credit to purchase health insurance , however , there could be better ways to model the tax credit . He said , The Heritage scholar I think the problem with the House ’s tax credit is that they could have more thoroughly modeled different ways of doing it , and hopefully in the Senate , they can have they variants and come up with a better design . " Senator Bill Cassidy ( ) proposed a solution for higher premiums that would    Americans without health insurance into a basic , catastrophic health care plan paid for by an individual ’s federal tax credit . The Louisiana senator explained , " Your best way to lower premiums is to expand the risk pool    …        would allow expansion of the risk pools . " Haislmaier noted some of the complexities behind the idea of    Americans who forgo health insurance . He stated : Haislmaier for    Americans without health insurance , you are mainly talking about a group of    people who choose not to buy insurance even if they are healthy insurance It ’s a practical question how do you make that work and stay with it , and It for people who are loosely connected to the workforce , and do n’t have a lot of income and usually go to a clinic to get care . This is the problem with expanding Medicaid it does not do a lot to change their behavior , expanding Medicaid does a it more to get the hospital paid . So there ’s a number of issues you have to think through on that , that I believe they have to do . Once you enroll people , how do you keep them in the people ? They do not people to pay nominal premiums , and that ’s what happened with Obamacare . With Obamacare , we Obamacare them insured in people subsidized coverage , and the insurers were surprised that once they were healthy people they would not people pay ten bucks to keep the coverage . very subsidized coverage a technical issue , how do you work through that and make it better ? Haislmaier It Breitbart News that the Senate bill should mirror the MacArthur amendment to lower premiums . The MacArthur amendment allows the MacArthur amendment waivers to rollback Obamacare regulations . He said : It Haislmaier not easy to balance out covering    conditions with lower premiums , that is where you saw some of the political difficulty in the House , and that ’s how they came up with the solution some of the political difficulty in the House the MacArthur amendment , which MacArthur states to lower premiums through a waiver . I think that the process , doing this as part of a budget reconciliation , means that the best you can get out of this is some sort of waiver this . Haislmaier responded to some critics of the AHCA that the bill does too little , too late . The state waivers for Obamacare regulations would only apply as early as 2019 and only if the state applies for the waiver . Haislmaier pointed out : That ’s Haislmaier they tied in some additional stabilization funding , they recognized that some of the they actions could not be done right away and to make it acceptable for reconciliation they have to tie some money they the bill . They ’re going to offer states they funding and other regulatory relief with the expectation that they ’ll use the extra funding they initially to keep things going for the next year or so before the relief can kick in . Keep in mind the target here is not the subsidized ACA exchange market , the target is the market that the target here to it , the    regular insurance market the target here that ’s where the spillover effect is . That ’s where everyone is experiencing higher premiums , deductibles , loss of insurers , and providers , and they ’re getting nothing in return . higher premiums, deductibles, loss of insurers, and providers they ’re trying to save is the higher premiums, deductibles, loss of insurers, and providers outside of the exchanges , for the individual and small employer plans . The ACA dumped a whole bunch of costly people to that market , and you got to the market outside of the exchanges and keep those    people and keep insurance affordable for them . What they ’re trying to do people the stabilization insurance is to provide insurers with some stabilization to help bring down premiums . This is a rescue effort at this point . There is a number of things that the Trump administration has done for 2018 , and they can do more things for 2019 and the Trump administration . Congress under the best circumstances , would not have been able to affect health insurance plan year 2018 , what Congress is working on is for further down the road . Haislmaier told Breitbart News that Congress ’s efforts for repealing Obamacare basically amounts Congress damage control , not true health care reform . He explained , " Let ’s be clear Haislmaier is not health reform , this is damage control for Obamacare . There this a lot more to Obamacare done . It ’s not going to happen overnight . "
