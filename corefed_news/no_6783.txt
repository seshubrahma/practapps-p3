Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker is promising to pad Planned Parenthood ’s state funding if Congress and President Donald Trump succeed in defunding the abortion giant at the federal level . [ " Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker is a strong supporter of women ’s health and believes the commonwealth has a responsibility to ensure access to the important health care services offered by Planned Parenthood in all corners of our state , " the Republican governor ’s spokeswoman , Lizzy Guyton , said , according to the Boston Herald . " And the administration is prepared to fund these the important health care services offered by Planned Parenthood in all corners of our state the federal government pursue changes that would block care for women and families here in Massachusetts . "   Mary Anne Marsh , a Democrat strategist , reportedly said Baker   —    who is up for    next year   —    " needs an overwhelming majority of unenrolled voters , and he needs Baker  —    Democrats , too . " " The majority of voters in Massachusetts are Massachusetts and " she added . " So it would hurt him more Baker  —    to do it than it do it . it Dr. Jennifer    chief executive of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts , Massachusetts told the Herald that elimination of Planned Parenthood ’s federal funding would block 10 , 000 Massachusetts residents Massachusetts obtaining contraception , cancer screenings , and tests for sexually transmitted diseases .

Baker " For every dollar spent , there ’s $ 7 saved in Medicaid funding for family planning . Gov. Baker is aware that Massachusetts has Massachusetts lowest teen pregnancy rate in the country , and cutting Medicaid funding Medicaid preventive services and birth control would reverse those gains .

President Donald Trump promised to defund Planned Parenthood if it continues Planned Parenthood abortions .
