Hollywood and other media progressives reacted to the death of U. S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia on Saturday with a mixture of sarcasm and jubilation . [ Scalia , who was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan , was considered to be one of the most conservative constitutionalists on the Supreme Court . He died of apparent natural causes Saturday while visiting a luxury resort in west Texas after a day of quail hunting .   While there were a number of leftwing celebrities who shared their condolences , others responded with the kind of vitriol you would expect from liberal Hollywood . Star Jones : The # GOP is vowing not to " permit "   # POTUS # OBAMA to do his Star Jones after # Scalia ’s death .
