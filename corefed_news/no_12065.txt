Professor John McAdams of Marquette University appeared on Breitbart News Daily Friday morning to discuss Professor John McAdams of Marquette University defense of traditional marriage , and how    enforcers are threatening Professor John McAdams of Marquette University position at Marquette University . [ Sirius XM host Stephen K. Bannon pointed out that Marquette is a Jesuit university , and wondered how a position in defense of traditional marriage could make trouble for a professor at such an institution .   " I did n’t actually even defend traditional marriage , " McAdams said .   " Simply the right of a student to defend traditional marriage without being bullied and demeaned .   That was the whole point about my blog post . "   In that my blog post McAdams McAdams the case of a student who was told to drop a class by an angry leftist professor , who exclaimed that defending marriage between men and women was intolerably " homophobic , racist , and sexist . " " As for    Catholic universities , first you have to understand that Jesuits are thin on the ground these days , " McAdams McAdams .   " The president of Marquette ’s not a Jesuit , the provost is n’t , the dean of arts and sciences is n’t   …      there are so few Jesuits that Jesuits Jesuit institutions pretty much are n’t run by Jesuits . Jesuits He added the provost the Jesuit order itself was no longer a " bastion of Catholic orthodoxy . "   This left universities like Marquette to suffer at the whims of " whatever fads prevail in academia generally . " " For example , if it ’s pandering to the gay lobby , they ’ll it’s pandering to the gay lobby to the gay the gay lobby they ’ve it’s pandering to the gay lobby so a lot , " said McAdams .   " If it ’s it to racial minorities   —    blacks , American Indians , Hispanics   —    they ’ll do that it’s pandering to racial minorities  —   blacks, American Indians, Hispanics  —    too .   And , like all universities , there ’s kind of a confluence of ideology and bureaucratic interest   —    that is to say , the administrators who run the university have an interest in hiring bureaucrats that work in their offices , so the administrators who run the university ’re always very the administrators who run the university to hire another assistant provost for things Hispanic , or associate provost to set up a bias reporting system , which Marquette has now . " The    institution of Marquette has been hit Marquette hard by political correctness , but McAdams warned there was a general trend of " nonsense in academia " sweeping through institutions of higher learning across the country , citing the example of Emory University students claiming they " felt so hurt and were so unsafe " because someone " put    Trump messages on the sidewalk . " As for his own case ,   Trump reported that Marquette McAdams said they Emory University him without they for the   Trump of the calendar year .   He would be allowed to   Trump in January , " if I abase myself and apologize " for   Trump blog post . He   Trump said he would   Trump required to   Trump promise to adhere to Marquette ’s guiding values and Emory University statement   …      which of course , in my view , I ’ve done . " Unfortunately , McAdams noted the bureaucrats at Marquette seem to interpret their Emory University statement not as the bureaucrats at Marquette    commitment to academic inquiry and free expression , but simply as , " you do n’t make trouble for the institution . " Professor McAdams declared he would McAdams McAdams apology McAdams by P. C. enforcers .   " I ’m not going to sign any ‘ loyalty oath’ to Marquette ’s mission   —    since I ’m , in fact , ’m ’m proponent of Marquette ’s claimed mission than the people Marquette the university , " he chuckled .   " But McAdams ’m against loyalty oaths . Interestingly , ’m lot of older liberals remember loyalty oaths in the 1950s , where professors were required to swear they were loyal to America and had a lot of older liberals sympathy for Communism   …      liberals hated that .   And now what you have is a liberal administration at Marquette demanding a loyalty oath from me Marquette " He declared his determination to fight McAdams university McAdams cheerfully noting that his lawyers are working pro bono McAdams so " Marquette ca n’t run me away by Marquette me build up huge legal bills . " " I think it ’s pretty clear , the odds are there ’s going to be a huge lawsuit , " he predicted . Breitbart News Daily McAdams on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST .
