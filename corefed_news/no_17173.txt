Washington ( CNN ) Neither Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson nor the Green Party ’s Jill Stein managed to make a dent in the Electoral College , but Jill Stein did post a significant enough showing in several states arguably to help elect Donald Trump .   Donald Trump won 290 Electoral College votes to 232 for Hillary Clinton , as of Wednesday evening , with Hillary Clinton topping Hillary Clinton in the popular vote . But had the Democrats managed to capture the bulk of    voters in some of the closest contests     Wisconsin ( 10 ) Pennsylvania ( 20 ) Michigan ( 16 ) and Florida ( 29 )     Hillary Clinton would have defeated Trump by earning 307 Electoral College votes , enough to secure the presidency .   The entire scenario conjures up memories of Ralph Nader ’s Green Party run in 2000 . Ralph Nader’s share of the vote in that year ’s    Florida contest was 1 . 63 % according to the final totals from the Federal Election Commission . Bush won the Florida just . 05 % which tipped the Electoral College in his favor Bush ( Nader Ralph Nader’s for years denied his Ralph Nader’s played a role in Bush ’s Bush . ) It ’s impossible to know how an election could have gone under hypothetical scenarios , but the Johnson campaign regularly said they thought they the Johnson campaign pulling the Johnson campaign equally from    Trump supporters and    Clinton voters . Stein ’s campaign , meanwhile , made a constant , explicit appeal to disenchanted Democrats and former supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders .   If Johnson and Stein Johnson n’t Stein the race , it ’s also possible many of their supporters may Johnson and Stein stayed home . But if about half of Johnson ’s supporters Johnson voted for Clinton over Trump , and if most of Stein ’s supporters broke Stein the Democrats , the electoral map would have been decidedly different . For what it ’s worth , both Johnson and Stein have Johnson repeated Stein with CNN taken offense at the notion they would spoil the Johnson and Stein .   Johnson said he hoped Johnson candidacy Johnson wipe Johnson the    system and , in a recent MSNBC appearance , literally held his nose shut at Johnson mention of Clinton and Trump . Stein said she would Johnson " Johnson well " in the event of a Clinton or Trump presidency Clinton suggested Trump would be more Clinton to start a nuclear war than the current   . However , Johnson ’s running mate , former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld , took a different tack . He defended Clinton regularly Johnson argued Clinton was a unique Trump to the United States . Johnson campaign spokesman Joe Johnson told CNN on Thursday " the    campaign was clearly a factor " and cited Colorado as a place where the Libertarian presidential campaign may have actually benefited Clinton . " To Clinton extent that independents and others found a voice through our campaign , were heard , and impacted the outcome , that is success     and ultimately an important step toward breaking the    hold on the system , " Hunter said . Also in a response on Thursday , Stein campaign press director Meleiza Figueroa dismissed any impact the Green Party may have had on the presidential election , citing the campaign ’s marginal our campaign battleground states . " There is no way statistically we could have been a " spoiler " for the outcome of the election , " Figueroa the presidential election " In Stein campaign press director Meleiza Figueroa case , the solution to a potential ’spoiler’ scenario should never be to silence political opposition and limit democracy to two    choices . " Here ’s the breakdown of what might have been , based on available totals for the key states : Florida ( 29 electoral votes ) Trump stood 119 , 770 votes ahead of Clinton , with 99 % of the vote in Wednesday evening . The total support for Johnson and Stein was 270 , 026 votes     well more than double Trump ’s margin of victory . Trump a Trump victory here .

The total support for Johnson and Stein was 191 , 565     almost three times Stein ’s margin of victory . CNN projected a Trump victory here .
