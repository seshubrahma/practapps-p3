Tuesday while on the campaign trail in New Hampshire , Republican presidential hopeful Se . Ted Cruz ( ) reacted to Donald repeating a    calling Ted Cruz " a pussy . "   Ted Cruz said , " Oh listen , nothing Donald Trump says Donald . You know , Donald does not handle losing very well . He did n’t like Donald he lost in Iowa Donald And his response often is Donald simply yell and insult and engage in profanity . My approach is to not respond in kind . From the beginning of the campaign when he and others have Donald to insult , chosen to go to the gutter , chosen to go to the mud —   I do n’t respond in kind . I ’m going to stay focused on the issues . I ’m going to stay focused on the substance . Now part of the reason that Donald engages in insults is because he ca n’t discuss Donald —   ca n’t defend his record . " Donald Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
