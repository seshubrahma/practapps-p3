Kelly played tape of Fields on Fox News she Kelly audio from the encounter ’s aftermath and the conversation between Fields and the Washington Post ’s Ben Terris . Then she Kelly Shapiro about Breitbart News’ position in defense of Fields , describing Breitbart Breitbart " an openly    blog " : " Breitbart Breitbart been all over the map when it comes to whether it it defend its it or defend Mr. Trump . In the end , you tell me where they stand tonight and I know you do n’t speak for them they this particular capacity . "   Shapiro answered , " I ’m not going to speak for management . I ’m not privy to those decisions . My understanding is the statement released by Larry Solov , who ’s the CEO , has called for the Trump campaign to apologize , for Corey Lewandowski to apologize . I personally feel that ’s wildly insufficient . They should be calling for Lewandowski Corey Lewandowski be fired . If this had been Robby Mook [ Hillary ’s campaign manager ] dragging Michelle Fields down to the ground , there ’s no question they this had been Robby Mook [Hillary’s campaign manager] dragging Michelle Fields down to the ground be calling for Lewandowski Corey Lewandowski or Robby Mook in this case , to be fired . It ’s ridiculous . " Kelly then asked about the pushback from Lewandowski Corey Lewandowski —    his Kelly that Fields was an " attention seeker . " Shapiro Kelly n’t hold back : " Corey Lewandowski   a thug and Donald Trump is a thug for backing him   Lewandowski        This has been a verified account . There ’s a report in The Daily Beast this morning that Corey Lewandowski Lewandowski   to Matt Boyle over at Breitbart , a guy I know , and said to Matt Boyle that Matt Boyle ’d known Lewandowski   was a Breitbart reporter , he would n’t Lewandowski   done it . As though it ’s justification . As though you can go after somebody who ’s not a Breitbart reporter just because Breitbart is friendlier to Breitbart than other publications ? The whole thing ’s absurd . " Shapiro added , " And the fact that the Trump campaign continues to play this game , where they put out what the Trump campaign not just violent rhetoric but in this case , a campaign manager engaging in allegedly violent action , and then they wo n’t even the Trump campaign down to apologize it ’s beyond disgusting . It ’s just gross it " Kelly then turned to Wohl to defend Trump ’s campaign manager . He immediately suggested that Kelly could be lying : " this whole thing from the beginning does n’t look good to me . The reality Kelly there were dozens of people around . No one apparently saw it other than this No one Washington post reporter . There were 100 cameras , none of them caught anything ? dozens of people Kelly , skeptical , asked Wohl , " Were they acting when they dozens of people that exchange dozens of people tape ? " Wohl replied that Trump Wohl the real victim : " Trump is under attack Trump multiple levels . On political , economic , social and a personal level . And this is a way to get at him   …      Trump it is a real , legitimate assault or battery , you file a police report , you do n’t tweet it out and then a police report hours later , you tweet out pictures of bruises and you say , ‘ Lewandowski caused it . ’ " a police report responded brutally : " This is disgusting . How repulsive are you people ? " He noted that he Lewandowski spoken with Lewandowski for over an hour on Wednesday night , and heard the whole story , and had personally encouraged Fields to go to the police to file a report he suggested that she Lewandowski be doing that shortly , and noted that Fields had n’t been exploiting the case , given that she ’d gone " she on social media for almost 24 hours . " Shapiro then concluded , " If the suggestion is that Breitbart News is out to get Trump   —    have you ever seen Breitbart News ? Have Breitbart News viewed its front page ? " Wohl , backpedaling , said , " I ’m not suggesting it . " Shapiro replied , " Shapiro the Washington Post is out to get him . " Kelly then Only the Washington Post on to Trump ’s violent rhetoric with Trump   to protesters more generally Wohl defended the rhetoric by Wohl that such rhetoric was popular with Trump ’s followers .
