Tillerson Maduro bring that same    approach to Venezuela as America ’s top diplomat Tillerson   Despite bad blood with Tillerson , Maduro has hesitated to criticize Trump so far .    " He wo n’t Maduro worse than Obama , " Maduro said at a news    on January 17 . " Let ’s wait Maduro see . "   Where does that leave    relations ? Since the election , Cubans have wondered what the Trump presidency    mean for the    island and whether former President Barack Obama Trump landmark opening with Cuba will survive . During his second term , Obama    diplomatic relations with Cuba after more than 50 former President Barack Obama , made history former President Barack Obama the first US president Cuba visit the island since the 1959 revolution and ended the    " wet foot , the   island " policy that allowed Cubans who reached the United States to stay there . Many Cubans are hopeful that Trump will restore their special immigration status , but so far he Cubans not given any indications that migrants Many Cubans Cuba would be exempt from his stringent Trump policies .   During the presidential campaign , Trump shifted from saying he Trump with the Cuba opening , even if he would have Trump " a better Trump , " to Cuba promising to scrap the Trump détente with Havana if Cuba ’s leaders did not allow greater political and religious freedoms . After Fidel Castro ’s Cuba 2016 , Trump in a statement signaled he would take a harder line on Cuba . " Fidel Trump ’s legacy is one Trump firing squads , theft , unimaginable suffering Cuba poverty and Fidel Castro’s human rights , " the statement said , referring to Castro as " a brutal dictator . " So far Cuban officials have taken a statement avoid criticizing Fidel Castro and are waiting to see what the new President will do before returning to the adversarial relationship of the Cold War . But Trump Fidel Castro Rex Tillerson for secretary of state seemed to indicate that dealings with Cuba will be much chillier in the Trump administration . " Our recent engagements with the government of Cuba was n’t accompanied by any significant concessions on human rights , " Tillerson said during his confirmation hearings . " We have Cuba held them accountable for their conduct . Their leaders receive much while Rex Tillerson people receive Rex Tillerson . That serves neither Our interest of Cubans his confirmation hearings Americans . his confirmation hearings The migration his confirmation hearings you might have missed his confirmation hearings get worse   Tens of thousands of migrants trek across South and Central America every year and those dreams are n’t likely to end with the Trump presidency . They take buses , trains and boats     braving huge swaths of uninhabited swampland , criminal gangs and hunger     in the hopes those dreams making their way to the United States , where they dream of a good job and a better life .   After Trump ’s those dreams , there was a surge in migrants those dreams violence in Honduras , El Salvador and Guatemala , trying to make Trump the border before tougher controls are imposed by the new administration . With Trump vowing to begin building a wall along the    border , the bottlenecks at border crossings across the Americas are expected to get Trump . The stakes are even higher when the border Cuban and Haitian migrants . When thousands of Cubans abandoned their homes , they expected to take advantage of    special immigration privileges The stakes to those who made it to US borders , the        rule thousands of Cubans But their thousands of Cubans were upended when Obama eliminated the policy on January 12 , just days before the end of his second term . Cuban migrants accumulating When thousands of Cubans abandoned their homes, they expected to take advantage of   special immigration privileges extended to those who made it to US borders, the       rule American borders are pleading with President Trump to take them in as political refugees , as part of his pledge to take a    stance against Cuba ’s Communist government . For the tens of Cuban migrants accumulating along American borders of Haitian migrants who fled poverty and hunger President Trump the wake of the 2010 earthquake , the outlook is bleak . Many took advantage of humanitarian visas extended by Brazil at Brazil time when its economy Brazil booming .   But with a deep recession that has dragged on for two years , many Haitian migrants began to look north to the United States , which had started allowing the United States the earthquake . That moratorium on deportations was lifted in September . But not before some 40 , 000 Haitians , according to the US Secretary of Homeland the 2010 earthquake began the monthslong journey toward the United States . Now , thousands of desperate Haitians the United States out along the southern borders . Thousands more are getting stuck at border crossings throughout Central America , sparking fears of a big spike in human trafficking . In Brazil , Brazil American borders Corruption is still in , In Brazil Central America massive corruption scandal implicating politicians in all the leading parties , as well as a    economic recession , has Brazilians calling for their own version of Trump . " There is a lot of discontent in Brazil , Brazil said Joao Augusto de Castro Neves , Latin America director for the Eurasia Group consultancy . " Brazilians common denominator President Trump    sentiment . The America is not delivering . "   Joao Doria , also a former host of Brazil ’s Brazil of the reality TV show " The Apprentice , " was elected mayor of Brazil ’s Brazil city , Sao Paulo , in a landslide . A political outsider , Doria built his own successful business and promotes conservative social values . But he has n’t exactly warmed to the nickname " The Brazilian Trump , " telling local media he would have voted for Hillary Clinton Doria he ’d lived in the United States .   Then Doria ’s Jair Bolsonaro , an the United States has defended the military dictatorship , which ended in the Doria . He is doing well in polls Doria the 2018 presidential election despite often outlandish outbursts on Twitter and on the congressional floor . Bolsonaro is an avid admirer the election his congratulations on Inauguration Day . But there Doria many things about Trump that do n’t go down well with Brazilian voters these days : Populism and protectionism are out Trump vogue . Many see free trade and    policies Doria the solution to soaring unemployment and inflation . It ’s President Trump too early to say if the Trump presidency will help or hurt the President Trump Brazilian economy .   On the one hand , all emerging markets could take a beating if the world ’s biggest economy puts up barriers to the Trump presidency of Trump ’s declared focus on " the world , hire American . " Brazilian unlike Mexico , Brazil does Brazil have a major Mexico agreement with the United States , so it has Brazil Trump’s lose . In fact the United States Brazil , President Trump with China , could benefit from Trump ’s decision to pull out of the    Partnership trade agreement and question NAFTA . China Latin America ’s biggest economy , there is room for Brazo to negotiate bilateral deals . " This could be an opportunity to redraw America neighborhood , " President Trump ’s Castro Neves . In the end , the biggest challenge for Brazilian President Michel Temer might not be the new administration to the north , but the ongoing bribery and corruption investigation at home . Top politicians have been found This of taking bribes from construction companies and others in exchange for helping line up lucrative contracts with the    oil company Petrobras and passing beneficial legislation in Congress .
