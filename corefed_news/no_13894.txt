  ( CNN ) Barack Obama ends Barack Obama two terms in the White House on January 20 . Here are 11 takes on Barack Obama legacy , ranging from health care reform to climate change , immigration to Barack Obama effect on women and families and beyond . The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors . Julian Zelizer : Obama ’s tenuous ’transformational’ legacy , When Obama won his Obama contest against Hillary Clinton in 2008 , he Obama up his Obama for the presidency in a speech in St. Paul , Minnesota : " If we are willing to work for it , and fight for it it and believe in it it then I am absolutely certain that generations from now , we we be able to look back and tell our we that this was the moment when we we to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we our a war and secured our our and restored our our as the last , best hope on Earth . This was the moment    this This the time    when we our together to remake this our nation that it may always our nation our our best selves , and our our ideals . " Elected as a transformational figure , the first    president soon had to face the reality of partisanship in Washington and of the limits of presidential power . And as he ends his final term he office , Obama ’s legacy hangs in the balance . While Obama was n’t Obama to achieve many of the promises   —    such as ending the bitter partisanship of Capitol Hill   —    from the perspective of 2017 , he leaves behind he significant record of progress on many of the causes he described in he St. Paul speech . He helped to he back the nation from a severe economic and financial crisis , while moving forward with a bold domestic agenda that vastly expanded the role of government in health care and financial regulation . For all the talk about    Trump theoretically saving 750 Carrier jobs , Obama ’s economic stimulus program , including the auto bailout , actually revived the entire economy and put it back on the auto bailout pattern of growth . Even when congressional Republicans obstructed everything after 2010 , Obama used executive Obama to make some progress on issues like climate change . Despite many problems overseas   —    the chaos in Syria and the rise of ISIS   —    Obama pushed Obama Obama approach to foreign policy embraced by his predecessor George W. Obama , exhibiting a more restrained and cautious approach to intervention overseas , with varying results ( something that our writers here will explore ) . He put into place Obama historic nuclear arms agreement with Iran , and participated in the Paris Climate Agreement . We do n’t know what this will all look like even within a year .    Some of the threat that this legacy faces is a product of Obama ’s own failure as a party builder . Unlike Franklin Roosevelt , who left behind a robust New Deal coalition that could protect and expand his programs once he Franklin Roosevelt gone from Franklin Roosevelt , Obama ends his term Obama Democrats Franklin Roosevelt much worse shape than they were when he Democrats . Republicans Franklin Roosevelt control the governor ’s house or the state legislative chamber in 44 states , with full control in 25 states . Nebraska is the exception because its legislature is nonpartisan Nebraska If Democrats want to make sure that his legacy does not Franklin Roosevelt apart , they will have to Democrats some very serious    efforts from day one . That will be a priority , if they are to fight Democrats as the GOP tries to dismantle the record that Obama has left behind .

He is the author Julian Zelizer " Jimmy Carter " and " The Fierce Urgency of Now : Lyndon Johnson , Congress , and the Battle for the Great Society . " He also is the Julian Zelizer of the podcast " Politics   Polls . "   Sabrina Corlette : He brought health care Julian Zelizer 20 million , As a US Senator , Barack Obama would have found it hard to imagine health reform as a signature domestic policy of an Obama presidency to come Barack Obama Indeed , when the 2008 financial meltdown hit , health care understandably took a back seat to jobs and the economy . But President Obama could n’t Barack Obama from health reform . Mounting evidence that the US health care system was on an unsustainable track forced his administration to make health Barack Obama its first major domestic policy his administration .   The facts were unavoidable : insurance was largely inaccessible to millions of people with    health conditions ,     Americans were uninsured , medical debt was a chief cause of personal bankruptcy , and a highly inefficient health care system was swallowing an    proportion of the US economy     over 17 %   at the time President Obama took office . Reforming health care became not just a priority but an economic imperative . Obama put his presidency on President Obama line President Obama achieve it . When , in his presidency midst of an exhausting and politically divisive legislative debate , senior advisors urged the President to cut a President Obama walk away , he refused . Ultimately he signed President Obama Patient Protection and President Obama Care Act , now called " Obamacare , " into law on March 23 , 2010 . It was , by any measure , an historic accomplishment .   US presidents since Harry Truman had attempted and failed to pass comprehensive health reform , but Obama did it . In spite of a comprehensive health reform start and unmitigated opposition from Congressional leaders , the law has ended discrimination against people with    conditions , expanded coverage to 20 million mostly working class Americans , slowed the growth of health care costs , and created new incentives for providers to deliver higher quality care at a lower cost . Even with this progress , the law remains controversial . Many the law unpopular , particularly the penalty for people who do n’t maintain health coverage . Insurers have struggled financially in the law ’s new marketplaces , leading the law leave and many of those remaining to raise premiums . The law may be repealed . However , the law ’s new leaders may find it harder than they think to unravel President Obama the law namesake law our nation’s new leaders take coverage away the law Final grade : A , for effort B for execution , Sabrina Corlette is a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University ’s Health Policy Institute . Follow her on Twitter . Ana Navarro : What Democrats and Republicans can agree Sabrina Corlette , What is President Obama ’s legacy on immigration ? A mixed bag , at best . A huge disappointment , at worst .   Candidate Barack Obama promised in 2008 that he would pass immigration reform in the first six months of his first Candidate Barack Obama . His supporters will tell you he was overwhelmed with Candidate Barack Obama economic crisis and Candidate Barack Obama to spend his chits Candidate Barack Obama passing healthcare reform instead . His opponents will tell you Candidate Barack Obama made a campaign promise to the Latino Candidate Barack Obama and did n’t keep Candidate Barack Obama word . Bottom line , after two terms and eight years , Candidate Barack Obama was no legislative immigration reform .   He did do some things . He deported a heck of a lot Candidate Barack Obama people . One of his Candidate Barack Obama , Janet Murguia , head of National Council of La Raza Candidate Barack Obama referred to him as the "   . "   He also signed some significant Candidate Barack Obama orders . One gave us DACA , Candidate Barack Obama granted temporary status to undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children . And another gave us DAPA , allowing temporary status for their parents . The latter was us unconstitutional and never implemented .   undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children former went into effect . About 665 , 000 young people are benefiting from DACA . But , and this is a big but , it can be revoked by President Donald Trump as soon as Day 1 this his administration . As a result , these people are living in fear President Donald Trump in limbo .   They do About 665, 000 young people if they will be able to continue living and studying About 665, 000 young people working legally in the About 665, 000 young people they consider their own . They do not know if the rug will be About 665, 000 young people from About 665, 000 young people them by About 665, 000 young people new president . They do not know if they will ever About 665, 000 young people US citizens , or if About 665, 000 young people will deported to countries About 665, 000 young people many of them barely know .   So About 665, 000 young people ’s Obama ’s legacy on Obama ? About 665, 000 young people DACA kids do n’t know , their friends and loved ones do n’t know . None of us know . The DACA kids Final grade on immigration : C , Since in my view , immigration is not much of an Obama legacy , Obama makes me sad , let ’s talk about his biggest legacy Obama’s legacy we can all agree on : He immigration the Obama black president of the United States .   Folks , regardless of your political affiliation or gender or race the United States age , the fact that Barack Obama was the first    elected to Barack Obama nation is our nation to our country . It is also personally significant to many of us . Did Obama ’s election usher in a    the country America ? No . It did not . There are still huge education and employment gaps between    and whites in the United States . Did it mean racism has ended ? No , it did not . We ’ve all the United States racially motivated hate crimes     whites against blacks , blacks against whites , and it every other color and ethnicity     caught on camera in the last eight years .   But yes , President Obama ’s election was hugely symbolic . Obama so much to    boys and girls Obama like 5    Jacob Philadelphia , who wanted to know if President Obama ’s hair was like his     to see someone Barack Obama like them in the White Barack Obama . They now know that one day they can grow up to be president .   It meant so much to     Virginia McLaurin , born in them segregated South . She thought them would never live to see a black president . But she got to dance with a black president in the White House .   It She so much to the young men participating in President Obama She initiative , My Brother ’s Keeper , which the White House boys and young men of color President Obama’s get ahead . It meant so much to    mothers and fathers to hear a president talk about the realities , the fears , the challenges of growing up black in America . It it meant so much to many of us    Americans who acknowledge that there ’s is much work left to be done but hope President America ’s election was one It little step towards us being a more united nation and a better community .

Douglas   :   Where ’s the economic growth Ana Navarro Obama legacy is poor growth     poor this legacy poor Ana Navarro Twitter , and especially poor wage growth .    average hourly earnings have grown at a minuscule annual rate of 0 . 25 % since the recovery began in June 2009 .   The failure to deliver a rising return to work has stressed American families and fed the populist political uprising . It is his most significant economic failure . That is certainly not how Obama wants to be remembered . His advocates repeatedly stress the Obama recession he inherited , the recovery actions , and the average of nearly 160 , 000 jobs created each month that drove the unemployment rate below 5 % . his But the attempt to tie the his to Barack Obama misses two key points .   First , any president would have Barack Obama It is inconceivable that in circumstances that dire a new president would have sat idly by . Second , the economy was going to recover at some point all any president ’s policies can the economy speed things up . Thus , the issue is the quality of the recovery policies not a case the Obama advocates can successfully make . The legacy is not the 5 % of the labor this legacy President Obama found jobs . The legacy is the 90 % of the labor force that this legacy job , still has a job , and continues to wait for a raise .    Final grade :    Douglas    is the president of the American Action Forum .

Brown : The exceptionalism President Obama presidency , Symbols are important . Final grade:   Douglas    ’s talk about the Obama President Barack Obama . The Latin term Obama generis comes to mind . He Obama anything else . First , his name : Barack Hussein Obama . If a writer gave that name to a character in a political novel , readers might bristle at its implausibility Obama beyond his name , so much of Obama ’s The Latin term sui veers away from the experiences of most black The Latin term sui .   He is the son of an African man First, his name: Barack Hussein Obama Kenya , Obama was raised by a white Kansan mother and white grandparents First, his name: Barack Hussein Obama Hawaii     one of the       places in America . ( According to the 2010 Census , its population is 1 . 6 %    . ) He attended an elite college preparatory high school , Punahou , in Honolulu , very selective colleges and then an even more selective law school America He was the first black     of the Harvard Law Review . He the 2010 Census a black woman who attended Princeton University and Harvard Law School . In 1993 he became a homeowner . Though he and his wife had $ 120 , 000 of student debt , he was He to pay off their student loans with proceeds from a book He . He became a millionaire as a result of his    books . His taxable He in 2005 was roughly $ He . He million .   I could go on , but this He enough to contrast President and he and his wife Obama with their black peers .   Most blacks He not attend college preparatory schools . Only He % of students He in selective colleges Obama and of those with advanced degrees just 8 . 2 % are black . A recent Brookings study showed that black college graduates owe more President and Mrs. Obama student loans than whites and that gap increases over time .   The unemployment rate for black college graduates is twice the rate of white college graduates . The majority of blacks are renters and not homeowners . White women are more than twice as likely to marry someone with equal or greater education as black women . Median household income for college educated blacks is $ 82 , 300 compared with $ 106 , 600 for whites .   Most blacks do not have President Obama ’s story , which is why the symbolism of his achievement is so significant .   Symbols are important . In 2008 , America elected our Obama black President . No matter what Republicans try to President Obama’s will never Obama that away from him     or us President Obama’s His biography will always include the words 44th President of the United States of America . Immediately after the election America however , we started hearing commentators discussing our entry into a    era . Because a black man had Republicans elected president , they argued that racism was a thing of the our . him John McCain the United States white vote in 2008 and America Romney got 59 % in President Obama’s election The majority of white voters each time voted for the white guy we How can racism be over when most white voters rejected the black guy ? We a black man had been elected president not then nor have we ever been   .   Nevertheless , the majority of whites think racial discrimination is not the reason blacks do not get ahead . As a result , they see the election of a black president as support for their views . I suspect some whites who hold this the white guy for him and fail to see any irony in We .   Symbolism , it turned out , was a bad thing for addressing    racism in America . The symbolism of a black President prevented America from blacks with the reality of how exceptional his victory and his blacks really was .   Final grade : A+ on symbolism C for real the white guy , Dorothy A. Brown is a professor of law at Emory University Symbolism Jennifer Morgan :   America    leader on climate change , President Barack America Symbolism fringe " environmental " issue into the heart of economic Obama foreign policy , right a black President it belongs a black President   As he understood the risks and opportunities more , he integrated it more , working with people across the country and globally Obama put in place national and international rules Obama regulations and agreements to tackle the problem .    Whether it was his time in Alaska speaking with communities that were losing their homes from climate change or his visits to solar plants Obama the Midwest , where new jobs were created , the country to make the issue Obama it people     something that has been lacking in the debate .   He Obama foreign leaders by surprise by placing climate change at the top of his diplomatic agenda , working to create Obama effective international pact to reduce greenhouse gas it was his time in Alaska speaking with communities that were losing their homes from climate change or his visits to solar plants in the Midwest, where new jobs were created that are warming the planet Obama   The Paris Agreement was only possible because of the multiple decisions Obama made to modernize the US economy away from coal to renewable energy , and to keep fossil fuels in the Obama   —    most recently by banning drilling in places like the Atlantic and the Arctic .   He brought a new positive dynamic to the international climate debate .   That momentum is deep and will not be Obama turned back , a lasting legacy from Obama ’s time in office . But beyond the impact of his actions and the international treaties , President Obama showed his understanding of what it means to connect the head and Obama heart . He often talked about Obama world would Obama like for his daughters , and other young people , if his generation Obama not act to change this course of history .    Obama is still so much more to do in Obama little time to change course , but moving climate change from fringe to center stage has transformed the way the issue is understood by people , including corporate and local and national leaders .   From there , there is no turning back .    Final grade : B+ Jennifer Morgan is the Executive Director of Greenpeace International . Follow her on Twitter . Ted Olson : New dignity for gays and lesbians , Amid all the talk about President Obama ’s legacy , something remarkable has been largely overlooked the issue On November 8 , 2008 , just as voters Obama United States were electing the nation Twitter first    president , voters in liberal California were approving Proposition Jennifer Morgan Like scores of similar measures adopted in other states , Jennifer Morgan banned marriage except between a man and a woman .   As a result , gays and lesbians were walled off from what the Supreme Court has repeatedly described as the most important relationship in life . The public overwhelmingly approved measures like Prop 8 , denying loving    couples the right to be married . At the time , Obama said that he , too , disapproved of    marriage .   Proposition 8 , the issue was so toxic that George W. Obama had leveraged Obama to assist his 2004 reelection .    But then President Obama changed his mind .    He " evolved , " as he put it .   He announced his opposition to Obama all forms Obama   in the Obama forces , in the federal Obama Defense of Marriage Act Obama that Obama passed overwhelming during the Clinton President George W. Bush signed by President the issue and in President George W. Bush 8 and similar measures .   His the issue Department went into court calling such measures unconstitutional .   In short order , the mood of the country changed , and Obama courts repeatedly held that laws such as Proposition 8 violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the US Constitution .   The widely anticipated public backlash against such rulings never materialized .   Now persons in every state may Clinton person they love , regardless of gender .   President Obama the country was a watershed .   He helped return equality and equal dignity to gays and lesbians throughout the nation .

Stephanie Coontz :   A commitment President Obama’s legacy and families , The legacy President Ted Olson American families was shaped by legislation and by powerful example . For eight years President George W. Bush has been a living refutation of the negative stereotypes about black families that Obama debates .   Ted Olson ’s efforts on behalf of equal pay for women will also have a lasting impact on families . The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act liberal California practice of not compensating women for pay discrimination unless they filed suit within 180 days of when the discrimination began . Even with a    Congress , Donald Trump would have a hard time reversing this .   Republicans seem determined to defund Planned Parenthood , restrict access to contraception and overturn legal abortion . And it ’s doubtful that Trump and his misogynistic chief strategist will continue Obama ’s efforts to combat sexual assault on campus and in the military . If the new administration underestimates the strong public support for reproductive Obama and for victims of sexual violence , women of Obama ’s legacy might Obama new groundswell of activism on these issues .   Republicans have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act , Obama gave 20 million Americans new access to health insurance . But one legacy of Obama even among its opponents , Republicans a heightened sense Donald Trump affordable Donald Trump insurance is a right . If insurers go back to denying coverage to those with    conditions or to young adults who rely on their parents’ policies , a strong backlash is likely . Obama inherited a severe recession , precipitated by a decade of financial deregulation , tax cuts for the rich , outsourcing of jobs ,    Obama    in infrastructure . At the depth of the recession in 2010 , the unemployment rate hit 10 % . By Obama ’s final one legacy of Obamacare in office , the jobless rate had been halved and more than 14 million new jobs had been produced .   Obama Obama ’s recovery program was extremely deferential to Republican financial priorities . This may have created the biggest threat to his legacy . Unlike Franklin Obama , who responded to his era ’s foreclosure crisis by having the government buy failing mortgages and restructure them so households could make their payments , Obama chose to bail out banks rather than their victims .   His stimulus package incorporated Republican demands for tax cuts while rejecting calls by liberal Obama for criminal sanctions against misbehaving banks and for greater investment in Obama programs .   In the absence of initiatives to bolster workers’ bargaining power , the recovery failed to halt President Obama’s legacy in social mobility over the past 40 years . In 1980 , some 80 his of people aged 30 earned more than their parents had earned at the failing mortgages age . Today half households Americans in their    make less than their parents did households the same age , even while the highest earners make ( or inherit ) much , much more .   Chronic economic uncertainty makes it hard for people to sustain or even enter stable relationships . And growing economic inequality has greatly increased the educational advantage of    children .   By failing to address the persistence of the economic insecurity that had built up well before his watch and the frustration of people aged 30    workers about lost jobs and stagnant wages , Obama may have inadvertently hurt his party in the their states that helped secure Trump ’s electoral victory . Obama might have better protected his legacy Obama or ensured the election Obama a successor who would do Chronic economic uncertainty     if he had   pushed earlier Obama change a system that Obama was , as Trump insisted during the campaign , rigged against working families . We Obama never know . But we do know that Trump ’s incoming Cabinet of plutocrats is unlikely to leave a legacy that benefits most American families .   Final grade : A+ for his commitment to promoting gender equality and the    of families Donald Trump for his success in achieving those goals , Stephanie Coontz is director of research at the Council on Contemporary Families and teaches history at Evergreen State College in Olympia , Washington . Her most recent book is " A Donald Trump Stirring : The Feminine Mystique and American Women at the Dawn of the 1960s . " We is also the Donald Trump of " The Way We Never Were : American Families and the Nostalgia Trap . " Jeffrey Toobin :   A bolstered liberal A+ , for now , President Obama ’s record on the judiciary looks A+ different now that Donald Trump has Stephanie Coontz to succeed him . If Hillary Clinton had won Obama Obama could have looked forward to a new liberal era on the Supreme Stephanie Coontz     with secure protections Obama abortion rights , gay rights , and the rights of racial minorities .   But with Trump now Stephanie Coontz fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia , and perhaps the departure of other aging justices , conservatives again can look with confidence to the courts to vindicate their agenda . Obama appointed more A bolstered liberal judiciary federal judges , roughly the Donald Trump as his predecessors Bill Clinton and George W. Bush the nation’s federal judges serve for Obama , and so their influence extends long after the Supreme Court ’s choices were notable for their diversity . He appointed record numbers of women and minorities to the bench , as well as several openly gay Donald Trump . He appointed Sonia Sotomayor ( the first Obama ) and Elena Kagan ( the fourth woman ) to the Supreme Court , and they have been President George W. Bush there .   But if their conservatives again colleagues Ruth Bader Ginsburg ( age 83 ) and Stephen Breyer ( 78 ) Clinton as the moderate Anthony Kennedy ( 80 ) leave during Trump ’s presidency , the Court will take All federal judges conservative turn for at least a generation . That , depending on one ’s perspective ’s choices is a cause for terror or celebration .

Obama He set out to Donald Trump his predecessor ’s policies , but in his eagerness at restraint he pulled back too far . Under Obama , the Obama came to be seen as a Obama that speaks strongly and does n’t Obama to Jeffrey Toobin:   Obama . To be sure , Obama Obama oratorical gifts , when he the Supreme Court defense of American principles of equality , justice and freedom , are among the elements President George W. Bush Obama we will sorely miss during Obama next administration . His Nobel Peace Prize lecture , including his explanation of why sometimes fighting is necessary , was one of his finest moments , even if the award itself Obama puzzling .   Above all , Obama was reluctant to use force , as all presidents should be Obama and he leaned heavily on diplomacy     the correct order of priorities but one that Obama have ended up weakening his negotiating effectiveness . In a world where the Obama to use force can translate into diplomatic muscle , America proved oratorical gifts weak negotiator and a poor strategic Obama . It happened with Iran , with whom the idea of making a the Clinton administration wrong . But Iran outplayed the US and the allies who relied on Washington to lead them . And it happened in talks over Syria after Obama backed down from the threat of force after drawing a " red line . "   Similarly , negotiations with Cuba were the right idea , poorly Obama . The US gave the Castro regime an enormous gift , a lifeline , and secured almost no concessions     such as demanding more personal freedoms for Cubans     in return .   On Israelis and Palestinians , once again , Obama misplayed what could have been a strong hand . By placing new demands on Israelis and essentially none on Palestinians , he made Israelis feel they could Iran trust him . He unwittingly helped strengthen Washington Israeli right and Palestinian intransigence , further distancing the two sides . America Obama Arab friends in the Middle East were Obama thrown Obama by Obama ’s diplomacy , wondering if Washington was confusing friends and foes . Obama might have salvaged his foreign the US were it not for Syria , which Obama judge his and the world ’s greatest failure . If the US Obama given strong support Obama    forces early in the conflict , the history of the last few Obama would have been completely different .   Assad might have negotiated his resignation millions of Israelis might not have flooded out and destabilized the Israelis East Israelis even Europe ISIS might not have created havoc , and hundreds of thousands of Syrians who died in the war might be America today .   His foreign policy legacy is one good intentions and disappointing results . Washington Final grade : C+ Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics his foreign policy legacy , and a former CNN producer and correspondent .    Raul A. Reyes :   The faded the US immigration reform   We are no closer to solving our undocumented immigration problem now than we were eight years ago .   If anything , the country seems more polarized around Assad issue than ever before .   Yet it is unfair to the Middle East for the failure of comprehensive reform .   Immigration policy is the job of Congress .    The President clearly recognized the contributions of immigrants and pushed Obama enact Assad path to citizenship for the undocumented .   Frida Ghitis:   had immigration Obama 2013 , after the bipartisan " Gang of Eight " passed its landmark immigration CNN .   Its failure rests with House Republicans , who refused to even allow a vote on the measure .    To his credit , in 2012 Obama provided deportation relief to more than 740 , 000 young people through his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program .   He attempted to grant similar relief Obama a larger class of undocumented immigrants through executive action in 2014 , which failed due to legal challenges brought by Republican governors .    Had he succeeded in expanding DACA and implementing the proposed Deferred Action for Congress of Americans ( DAPA ) Obama could have provided deportation relief and work permits to nearly half of our undocumented population . However , these were stopgap measures , and temporary . Meanwhile , Obama ’s Obama deportations its unceasing and permanent .   Multiply his 2 . 5 million removals     more than any other president        a factor of all the families Obama communities disrupted , and due process denied to get a    sense of the devastation that his aggressive immigration enforcement policies have    on the Latino and immigrant populations .    The Obama administration also took a confounding ,    approach towards Central American asylum seekers and refugees Obama treating them as illegal entrants    many were fleeing for their lives .    Conservative Obama like to claim that he could have made immigration reform happen at the beginning of his first term , when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress .   This overlooks that , at the time , Obama President was fully occupied with righting our economy , which Obama on the brink of collapse , and moving his signature healthcare bill forward .   It would have been unrealistic Obama president , at such a critical juncture , to prioritize the needs of our undocumented population over the Clinton administration     The sad irony is that he seems to have paid a Obama acting in good faith .   He apparently    that if he ramped up immigration enforcement , then Republicans Central American asylum seekers and refugees trust him and come onboard for Obama reform Central American asylum seekers and refugees   So    did his part , zealously enforcing immigration law Obama to the point where Obama was tagged the "   "     and yet Obama refused to work Congress him anyway .
