Dr. Sebastian Gorka , deputy assistant to President Trump and former national security editor for Breitbart News , joined SiriusXM host Lee Stranahan for Thursday ’s Breitbart News Daily . [ SiriusXM host Lee Stranahan brought up the outrageous allegation by a    blogger that Gorka was a Nazi sympathizer , based on a medal he was seen wearing . The false story was eagerly repeated , without the slightest bit of    by Chelsea Clinton and the Southern Poverty Law Center , among others .   " My parents escaped Communist Hungary in 1956 , " Gorka recalled . " My father actually escaped from a prison , a Communist prison , because My father was an    and My father had been betrayed and given a life sentence at the age of 20 . In exile , My father was awarded a medal   —    it ’s the Order of the Vitez   —    for My father resistance to dictatorship in Hungary . "   " That Order , for some people , because it is associated with the regent , Admiral Horthy , the regent, Admiral Horthy think that makes my father , who escaped from a Communist prison , a fascist , and , therefore , " My father explained . " It ’s never about policies , Lee . It ’s always about attacking the individual , " Gorka told Stranahan . " My father was tortured in the basement of what used to be the Nazi secret police headquarters , at the age of twenty . My father was tortured by Communists who , just a few years before , had been members of the Arrow Cross . That ’s the irony of central Europe . A lot of fascists became Communists . " " Remember , on the radical Left , facts are optional . I am on TV . I ’ve been a vocal supporter of President Trump during the campaign . They have to attack me . It ’s about Steve Bannon . It ’s about Jared Kushner . It ’s about General Mike Flynn . It ’s not about the policies . It ’s not about the substance . It ’s about ad hominem attacks . If you want to be effective , It ’s about triangulation and isolation . That ’s all it is , Lee . You know it better than anybody , " Gorka said . " The irony is , the first person who wrote this article about Lee was allegedly fired from his last employer for      attitudes , " his noted . " That ’s the reality . You read my book , Defeating Jihad . my book ’s about how Israel is Israel closest ally . Not only that , I have said , for Lee , groups like ISIS and    are the new fascists . The linkage between groups that burn people alive , that behead people because people have the wrong passport , the linkage between people and the Communist and the new fascists is the same . They people all totalitarians . One of them people have worshiped Karl Marx . The other may have worshiped the Aryan purity and Mein Kampf . These people totalitarians , as well , groups like ISIS . They ’re people doing it in the name of their version people Islam . " Gorka agreed with Stranahan that attacks on Trump administration officials like himself are Stranahan attacks on his " Stranahan . " " It has to have that broader connection . Why ? Because what I ’ve seen in the last      weeks of us being in office is all we have us a majority of the media reporting reflects one thing , Lee : they can one thing, Lee believe , refuse to believe , what happened on November the 8th . The American people spoke . The ‘ forgotten man’ was given a voice . And they ca one thing, Lee stand it , The ‘forgotten man’ . Lee   " As a result , what President Trump stands for must be attacked day in and day out . It ’s what President Trump stands about policies . Remember , we never talk about Russia policy . It ’s about who bugged Mike Flynn , and what he said Lee the vice President Trump ’s never about It . It ’s never about It . It ’s the classic It , Lee : ‘ When did you stop beating your wife?’ Remember ? That ’s what they ’re doing , " he said .
