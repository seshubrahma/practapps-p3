"   " Look , this ideal that the Democrats need to spend more time having a conversation with white voters is patently absurd , " Cornell Belcher told host Joy Reid . " We spend 80 percent of We resources right now chasing this mythical , unicorn white swing voter . The truth of the matter is , look , We ’re not winning more    white voters because we ’re racially polarized . These people want These people country back and These people saw Donald Trump as the strong , great white hope to give These people their country back .
