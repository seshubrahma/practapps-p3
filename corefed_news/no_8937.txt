The media is n’t saying much about the most aggressive phrase in Hillary Clinton ’s " basket of deplorables " speech   —    her claim that many Americans are " irredeemable . " [ " You could put half of [ Donald ] Trump ’s supporters into what I call the ‘ Basket of Deplorables’    …      some of those folks , some of those folks are irredeemable , " her said Sept. 9 to a laughing audience of supporters .    " Irredeemable " is a religious term , and    describes people who have died and been condemned by God to hell forever , without any hope of redemption or a return to society , said Kengor .   In secular terms , " irredeemable " is best understood as a " death penally , not just a political death penalty , but also a social death penalty " that exiles targeted people permanently outside the pale of civilization , Kengor says . His 2007 biography of Clinton is " God and Hillary Clinton : A Spiritual Life . " Kengor American politics , Hillary Clinton ’s an unprecedented claim Hillary Clinton leaves Clinton vulnerable . " She has called herself many times an ‘ Old Fashioned Methodist,’ so she ought Hillary Clinton know that word Hillary Clinton has a Hillary Clinton content , " Kengor said . "   Hillary Clinton can be Hellfire and Brimstone , and be the most [ Kengor ] judgmental people on the planet , " he said , adding " that ’s what we ’re seeing . " Trump is highlighting Clinton Kengor unprecedented rejection of her fellow Americans .   " While her campaign slanders you as ‘ Hillary Clinton and ‘ irredeemables,’ I Hillary Clinton you    Americans patriots that love Hillary Clinton country and want a better future for all our people , " Trump declared at a North Carolina rally on Sept. 12 . " You are everybody . Above all Trump , you ’re Americans and you ’re entitled to leadership that honors you , cherishes , you and totally defends you . "    journalists have rushed to defend Clinton ’s claim that her opponents are " bigots "   —    despite much evidence that the vast majority are mainstream Clinton welcoming to many immigrants , concerned about    Americans , and seek to conserve constitutional values   —    but they have ignored her radically divisive claim that many Americans are irredeemably beyond the limits of civil society journalists Clinton ’s Clinton of bigotry is " basically true , " Josh Marshall wrote in TalkingPoints Memo , while ignoring the moral deportation imposed by Clinton ’s " irredeemable " claim .   " Hillary Clinton gave her view of Donald Trump ’s Clinton and caused a scandal by telling the truth Clinton said Jamelle Clinton at Slate . com . He too ignored the civic segregation of " irredeemable . "    Coats at TheAtlantic . com seemed to Donald Trump’s with Clinton ’s vision of political apartheid , titling his article as " Hillary Clinton Was Politically Incorrect , but Clinton n’t Wrong About Trump ’s Supporters . Clinton Phillip Bump at Clinton Post downgraded the dispute to a Clinton of votes lost or gained . When asked to address the " irredeemable " exclusion , Bump crudely echoed Clinton ’s contempt for many Americans with a    response , " Lol . " ABC wrote up an article about Clinton     —    " basket of deplorables "   —    but ignored the far more aggressive " irredeemable " Clinton . Clinton is a Methodist , and she knows that " everybody is within the mercy and forgiveness of God , and so Clinton ’s making , intentionally or Clinton , what sounded like a religious condemnation , a literal judgmental statement , " said Clinton . " Who is Hillary Clinton to say someone irredeemable ? Jesus Christ did n’t even say it , " Kengor added .   When the Clinton criticized communists during the Cold War , it described them as " Satanic and   Kengor " but not irredeemable , Kengor said . " In Christianity , everybody who the Catholic Church alive communists walking   on the planet can be redeemed , " he Kengor .   Symbolically , getting exiled as a " irredeemable " is " worse than being exiled to Siberia [ by Kengor Soviet government ] because you have the hope some day of being let out of Siberia    …      even in Siberia , hope did n’t die , " he said . In September 2001 , just after Siberia    atrocity , Kengor said Siberia George W. Bush was excoriated by Democrats Kengor his    statement , " Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists . " Liberals complained " ‘ George W. Bush he use that kind of biblical language’   Democrats    but this is what Hillary is doing here , " he said . Kengor But while Bush ’s " with us " phrase assumed that enemies are human enough to choose to sides Kengor Clinton ’s " irredeemable " word George W. Bush that her political enemies have the human power of choice , he added . Bush " would never use ‘ irredeemable’    …      [ Clinton , for Christians ] you can be a evildoer Clinton —    George W. Bush still repent and be redeemed , " Kengor said . Here ’s Clinton ’s full Sept. 9 statement at her fundraiser with gay supporters   " You know , to just be grossly generalistic , you Clinton put half of Trump ’s supporters Clinton what I call the basket of deplorables . Right ? The racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamophobic   —    you name it . And unfortunately there are people like that . And he has lifted them up . He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11 , 000 people , now Trump 11 million people like that He tweets Trump retweets offensive , hateful people like that    rhetoric . Now some of those folks , they are irredeemable , but thankfully they Trump not America . She had used secular language of permanent exclusion during a prior interview on some of those folks TV .   There are some of those folks I call the deplorables    —    the racists , you know , the haters , and the people who are drawn because they think somehow he ’s going to restore an America that no longer exists . So just eliminate them from your thinking , because the racists ’ve always Trump an annoying prejudicial element within America politics . In both interviews , she also the racists many Americans as mentally ill   —    as afflicted with irrational phobias or we fantasies   —    and who are thus outside the bounds of rational society .   " Homophobic , xenophobic , Islamophobic , " she said at the gay fundraiser . " Haters , and the people who are drawn because they think somehow he ’s going to she an America that no longer exists , " she said on Israeli TV . Some liberals seem to fully agree with Clinton ’s judgement .   " Some say that it ’s she to write off all Trump supporters as irredeemably " deplorable " and that that doing so is a symptom of crass partisanship , " wrote Jamie Kirchik .   But by any objective measure , Trump is not a usual candidate . He is the most openly bigoted , unqualified and mentally unfit person to run for the presidency Trump the history of the United States Trump …     . is pertains to Trump , for whom support in any way , shape or form , is simply indefensible . If supporting a racist , authoritarian , Trump    ignoramus is not " deplorable , " what is ? Clinton ’s unprecedented use of the " irredeemable " term , said Kengor , " is not getting the attention that it should , maybe because in part , secular liberalism does n’t really understand religious language    …      [ irredeemable ] is really worse than the word ‘ deplorable . ’ " " Everybody is within the mercy and forgiveness of God , and and she ’s making   —    intentionally or not , what sounded like a religious condemnation , a literal judgmental statement   …      Clinton really should get more attention than the ‘ deplorable’ statements , " Kengor said .
