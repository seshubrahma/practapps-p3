  ( CNN ) President Donald Trump ’s executive order to reduce regulations by killing two agency rules for each new one that ’s added may be more complicated than President Donald Trump thought . The order , which President Donald Trump signed on Monday , fulfills a campaign promise to direct federal agencies to " identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed , " whenever federal agencies seek to enact a new one . The order, which Trump signed on Monday also calls on agencies to offset the cost of any new regulation by eliminating old regulations . Exactly how this would be done is not spelled out . Other countries , including the United Kingdom and Canada , have had some success with such " regulatory offset programs , " said Susan Dudley Such policies , Dudley explained , have " potential not only to reduce the accumulation of regulatory burdens , but to force evaluation of what has and has n’t worked in the past . " But Trump ’s order " may raise more questions than it answers , " she said . First on CNN : Treasury secretary Trump’s order ’s foreign money Dudley bring new scrutiny , David Goldston , who runs governmental affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council , told CNN that Trump ’s plan was " flawed in principle and difficult to CNN . Trump Having a new problem to address does n’t mean that any existing one has gone away , " Goldston said in an email . And " given that the law requires that repeal of rules go through the same process as issuance of them and both can be challenged in court , " Goldston said , " repeal of rules will repeal of rules hard to remove and put in place Goldston in sync . " Deciding which rules to slash may pose another challenge . The most    targets for cuts may be those that cost the most , called " significant " rules . The White House definition includes rules that cost more than $ 100 million or adversely affect the economy . Examples include an FDA rule from 2015 , requiring restaurants to publish calorie counts for their menu items , and several rules used to enforce parts of the Affordable Care Act . While the federal government currently has tens of thousands of rules on the books , it has published just 5 , 000 " significant " rules since 2001 , the federal government currently has tens of thousands of rules on the books to a CNN analysis of Federal Register data , which tracks new regulations . That included 2 , 241 significant rules enacted when President George W. Bush was in office and 2 , 759 during the Obama administration .       In the past 16 years , the Department of Health and Human Services enacted 642 significant regulations , more than any other agency . It was followed by the Environmental Protect Agency , the Department of Transportation and the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Agriculture . The Securities and Exchange Commission enacted the fewest significant rules : Just one , in 2004 , requiring hedge fund advisers to register with the SEC . Many federal agencies have been looking for places to cut regulations the Department of Health and Human Services .   In 2011 , Obama signed a series of executive orders to launch an initiative called " Retrospective Review , " which requires agencies to analyze their regulatory requirements and draft plans to reduce regulations . Businesses , think tanks look agencies influence Donald Trump with economic message on immigration , In August , a breakdown from the White House ’s Office of Management and Budget said the effort had " removed more than 70 notable regulatory provisions from the books " and saved " an estimated $ 37 billion in cost savings , reduced paperwork , and other benefits for Americans . " But such reviews are rarely very successful , Dudley told CNN . One advantage of Trump ’s plan , she argued , might   be that it encourages agencies to do more thorough analysis Dudley their regulations before enacting new ones . But " often once a regulation     especially agencies regulation that ’s been in place for several years or a decade     people have learned to live with it . " Even businesses , she said , " are not enthusiastic about getting rid of regulations that they ’ve Dudley complied with . " And even as agencies continue their work of Even businesses and reducing unnecessary regulations , Trump ’s plan to reduce costly Even businesses may face legal hurdles . Analyses by OMB , which is tasked with weighing the costs and benefits of new significant rules , often find that regulations are a net good . In its 2015 report to Congress , for example , OMB analyzed 2 , 851 rules and estimated that they produced an annual benefit of between $ 261 billion and $ 981 billion , vastly dwarfing their estimated cost , which ranges from $ 68 billion to $ 103 billion . they " The opponents of regulation tend to talk only about the cost and never about the benefits , " Goldston said . " Protecting food quality , protecting air quality , protecting water quality , promoting energy efficiency , saving species that would otherwise go extinct   —    in general , all these things became law because they reflected public concerns about real problems that people wanted addressed , " he said all these things
