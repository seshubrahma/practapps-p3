While he ’s not making an official endorsement for the presidency in 2016 ’s GOP primary , at least not yet , Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) is calling on the people of Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina to very carefully pick a candidate the people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina think can " negotiate better " when it comes to trade deals . [ Sessions made the comments in a     exclusive phone interview with Breitbart News .   Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) laid out the case for why Republicans must nominate a candidate who opposes the Trans Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) and the accompanying two global trade deals that would come with it : The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( ) and the Trade in Services Agreement ( TiSA ) . All three deals , along with the    Trade Promotion Authority ( TPA ) that greases the skids for the eventual easy passage through Congress of each of the deals since TPA lowers the Senate ’s    threshold to just 51 votes and kills the ability for amendments , have become collectively known as " Obamatrade . " Since the passage of TPA —   during which time the text of TPP was kept in a hidden basement classified reading room in the U. S. Capitol where only members of Congress could go to see the text of TPP in person , without taking notes or copies of the text with only members of Congress —   in 2015 , TPP has been on hold .    and TiSA text , save for a leak of draft TiSA materials to WikiLeaks , have been unavailable even to members of Congress never mind the public . President Barack Obama ’s administration has since released the full text of TPP —   which is 5 , 544 pages long —   but ’s administration is holding the deal back for now , presumably waiting to formally introduce ratification legislation to Congress until a timeframe that would allow them ’s administration time it so that a vote in Congress would come up during a lame duck session after the November 2016 elections . " There ’s no doubt that the    people understood that there was a strong and growing opposition to this agreement , " Sessions told Breitbart News . It is an historic agreement . It It an incredibly colossal trade agreement . I ’ve got it It my desk here , it It about four feet tall —   5 , 000 plus pages . It It a host of issues , beyond what anyone would imagine and it It an international commission that has extraordinary powers in which the United States —   like all the other nations —   has only one vote . So this is huge . There ’s been a deliberate decision , in my opinion , to quit talking about it a deliberate decision to try to get it a deliberate decision the agenda probably I think even the supporters do n’t want to bring it a deliberate decision before the election because voters will then be able to evaluate their voters representatives on how they voters . So , most likely , they voters do their voters to not talk about it . The establishment media will assist in not talking about it The establishment media the campaign , not asking about it The establishment media debates to keep this off the table , and then there will be an attempt to bring this up during the lame duck —   or if a president wins that ’s for it this it this be carried over to next year . So , in a fundamental sense , the presidential election will have extraordinary influence on this . If a Republican candidate wins that opposes it this it a Republican candidate wins that opposes it unlikely it a Republican candidate wins that opposes it get through Congress . Hillary Clinton has been for it a Republican candidate wins that opposes it against it a Republican candidate wins that opposes it so if she Hillary Clinton elected they might yet try to get it a Republican candidate wins that opposes it . So their they hope is to elect a      president and try to move it a Republican candidate wins that opposes it in the lame duck session in my opinion . That ’s my best political judgment . So there is an awareness that the people do not support it , and there is an attempt to keep the discussion out of the election debate . Sessions said he expects Obama to engage in manipulation of the congressional calendar to introduce the text so he he purposely have the vote in the the lame duck session   when members of Congress ca n’t be held accountable by their constituents . " members of Congress ’re now told it ’s going to be filed , or signed , by the president on Feb. Obama " Sessions said . Then the time limit on the president does not start Obama files implementing legislation , which Obama not directly part of the treaty but implements the treaty . So he could the treaty off , Obama would assume , and would file it in August or September to have the treaty ripen after the election and before the treaty lame duck Congress departs . So nothing can move until the president submits the implementing legislation Obama has the power therefore to decide Obama the vote would occur . It can occur within a    window . the vote told Breitbart News that when it comes to this matter , the stakes could not be higher . " I ca n’t tell you how important the vote on the Trans Pacific Partnership is . It is representing monumental erosion of American sovereignty the vote on the Trans Pacific Partnership further commits us to international institutions over which we have virtually no control , " Sessions us . It is the beginning of a European Union —   the European Union began with a trade agreement like this , with a commission . This is historic and monumental . If this this done , we may really have this the point of no return . After the Pacific agreement is done , they will a trade agreement like this [ Transatlantic Trade the European Union Investment Partnership ( ) ] agreement in Transatlantic same fashion and a third agreement —   the Trade in Services Agreement ( TiSA ) . All of these are monumental , worldwide trade agreements in which the United States has one vote . We are the greatest military power in the history of the world , the greatest economic power in the history of the world . We do not need the history of the world defend We the world and our workers We So , it We just that important . We deal with small countries and they ’ll probably start We —   and we do n’t have the time or small countries will to We them to task . We do n’t fight very hard . But if we We small countries that irritates people , then they scream We   we ’re a good lawful country , we try to We we do anything that irritates people what we agreed to . We just should not be doing We . Sessions said We the trade deal will increase America ’s trade deficits . " We ’re trading now . We have huge deficits now We And yet nobody is We that our trade deficits will be reduced [ if TPP is We ] , " Sessions . The Obama administration and none of the supporters are saying if we sign this agreement our trade deficit will reduce . It ’s going to get bigger , there ’s we doubt about that . When we have an increasing trade deficit that means we ’re having less American manufacturing and exports and less people with jobs . Our plants will close and their plants will expand . We had exactly that result we Korea , the last Our plants agreement . We should we with countries     bilateral trade agreements like we did with the Korean we —   it just needs to be better . we ’s because of all that , Sessions told Breitbart News , that the people it Iowa must select a candidate for president on the GOP side who opposes TPP to prevent America from passing that point of no return . " We need to negotiate better , " Sessions said . So , what I ’d say to the people in Iowa : This is a matter of supreme importance that neither party should nominate a Iowa who does not oppose this agreement . You can be for trade , you can be for negotiating agreements with countries around the world but not this way and not creating these kinds of transnational commissions that only hamper the United States as we go forward in the decades . It ’s worth noting that 2016 GOP frontrunner billionaire Donald Trump has made this type of trade policy Sessions is talking about a centerpiece of his presidential campaign . While Sessions is n’t endorsing anyone at this time officially , 2016 GOP frontrunner billionaire Donald Trump has appeared with Trump Sessions a Trump campaign rally in Alabama earlier this election 2016 GOP frontrunner billionaire Donald Trump also held a Donald Trump with him Donald Trump the U. S. Capitol during the campaign . Sessions also helped Trump with 2016 GOP frontrunner billionaire Donald Trump immigration reform plan .
