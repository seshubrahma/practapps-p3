Monday on CNN ’s " New Day , " conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is a " very dangerous man . "   " conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck said , " What I have warned about for so long   —    people only focus when I was at Fox , only focused on what I was saying about Barack Obama   —    but when I was at CNN , I was saying much of the same stuff about George W. Bush . Nobody paid attention . When I was at Fox , I warned Democrats , please understand if you let the balance of power go out of whack the next guy who can get in could be calling Fox a Republican and Fox will take that same power and use that same power at the same level or expand that same power . That is a very bad thing . We need a Constitutional restraint on the executive branch . And Donald Trump I believe is a very dangerous man . If you listen to things Donald Trump said this weekend    …      ‘ I could go on to Fifth Avenue and shoot people and would n’t lose a vote.’ Donald Trump has joked about killing reporters and not killing reporters like Putin does . Donald Trump is a very dangerous man . Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
