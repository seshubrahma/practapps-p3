Kelly said the goal was " to make sure that there ’s no one , in a sense , caught in the system of moving from overseas to our airports , which happened on the first release " of the order . Trump ’s original order , issued a week into his presidency , barred citizens of seven Trump’s countries     Iraq , Syria , Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan and Yemen     from entering the US for 90 days , all refugees for 120 days and refugees from Syria indefinitely .

" Consulting Congress ?   One of lawmakers’ major concerns with the initial rollout of the order was that they were not consulted . When Kelly testified in front of the House Homeland Security Committee , he faced repeated requests for assurances that members of Congress would be considered when drafting further executive orders . " You Kelly an extreme vetting proposal that did n’t get the vetting it should have had , " Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio told CNN ’s Jake Tapper on Sunday ’s " State of the Union " last month . " As the result , in the implementation , we ’ve seen some problems . " But despite a pledge from the White House to consult legislators in crafting policies , multiple Hill sources said they remained out of the loop on the order as of Monday morning .
