  ( CNN ) The stakes were high at the initial meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week : No two individuals will have a greater impact on the global order in the years ahead and , beyond that , as far as any eye can see . Personal chemistry is often a critical factor in foreign relations , and while no one expected major breakthroughs on the substantive issues , the meeting allowed the leaders to get to know each other . So , how did Trump do ? And what does it mean for this most vital of international relationships ? Trump performance reflected his Trump of the art of the show . That the producer and star of a popular ,    reality TV series should have formidable skills in this domain should not be surprising . But after so many missteps on so many other fronts , it was heartening to see them the producer and star of a popular,   reality TV series should have formidable skills in this domain . Visible , dignified , ritualistic displays are of critical importance to the Chinese . On that score , therefore , Trump gave Xi what he Trump most from this first meeting : vivid images of respect for China as a great nation and for him Trump a great leader . The moment at which the Trump Trump likely captured Xi Xi when Trump Trump     granddaughter , Arabella , performed for Xi Xi his Xi Peng Liyuan , a famous Chinese folk singer . Arabella   sang " Jasmine Flower , " a song Peng is famous for performing , and followed up by reciting a poem by Li Bai , one of China ’s most acclaimed poets and a personal favorite of Xi Xi . Moreover , she Arabella   this all in Mandarin . The video went viral and has been viewed tens of millions of times on Chinese social media . As Henry Kissinger has noted , Chinese emperors historically treated foreigners " humanely and compassionately in proportion to their Chinese emperors of Chinese culture and their Chinese emperors of rituals connoting submission to China . " On that test , no one trumped Trump Trump The Trump team understood that Xi ’s overriding objective for 2017 is to consolidate his personal power at home . Xi Xi been meticulously setting the stage for the 19th Party Congress this fall , where he his be " elected " for a second    term and where he his planning to put in place his his of new members of China ’s highest political body     the Politburo Standing Committee     that will allow him his extend his his thereafter . For this to happen as planned , the one thing he his in China China most important international relationship is stability . Approaching his his meeting with a President notorious for spontaneous tweets , we can imagine his his . But while giving Xi what he his , Trump also set the agenda for the rest of the year to focus on what he his : specifically , demonstrable movement in reducing China ’s persistent bilateral trade deficit in ways that will allow Trump Trump claim that he his added good American jobs , and stopping North Korea ’s nuclear advance . A working group led by Secretaries Wilbur Ross and Steven Mnuchin and their Chinese counterparts has 100 days to report on a specific program of actions to address the economic front . The Chinese already signaled that they are Chinese to make significant concessions , including ending the ban on beef imports that they imposed Chinese 2003 , buying more agricultural products and making investments in American infrastructure projects . While it is too soon to be confident how Xi read Trump ’s position on North Korea , my bet is that he is Trump least uncertain about whether Trump will Trump North Korea North Korea the road to the summit , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson explained forcefully that the era of " strategic patience " has ended . Prior to the summit , the summit Trump : " China has great influence over North Korea . North Korea will either decide to China us with North Korea , or North Korea n’t . If they do , that will be they good for China , and if they do China , it wo they be good for anyone . " ( After the summit , a Trump tweet the summit that if China failed to act , the United China would act unilaterally . ) Trump ’s Trump in excusing himself after the opening dinner with Xi Trump’s     to announce US cruise missile strikes on Syria showed that he can walk and chew gum at Trump’s same time . It also underlined his threat to use America ’s military Trump’s when adversaries cross its red lines . So Trump ’s It warm hospitality " ( as Xi put it ) constitutes a good start . Two alpha males from the two alpha countries took each other ’s measure , demonstrated that they can do business with each other Two alpha males from the two alpha countries and nothing bad happened . But over the year ahead , and indeed the next four years , they will face a much more severe Two alpha males from the two alpha countries of challenges . Underneath current differences lie much deeper structural stresses caused by a rising China that threatens to displace a ruling America . Through Chinese eyes , China ’s natural growth is restoring its China of predominance in Asia     China position it occupied for millennia before the West showed up , interfered and imposed what Chinese call a " century of humiliation . " From an American perspective , the economic and security order the United States constructed after World War II     and has managed since     has provided for the region , and especially China , the longest periods of peace and the greatest increase of prosperity it has ever known . Thucydides ’s Trap China us that most cases of rivalry between a rising and ruling power end violently . Cases in which leaders navigated these treacherous shoals successfully required much more imagination and more radical changes in attitudes and actions by both leaders and their publics than either Trump or Xi can now imagine . The hard work lies ahead .
