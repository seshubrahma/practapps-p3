During Congressional testimony Tuesday , a former federal border commissioner claimed that illegal immigration across the Mexican border is progressively dropping each month since the inauguration of Donald Trump . [ David V. Aguilar , former U. S. Border Patrol and acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner , told the Senate Homeland Security Committee that March 2017 figures he reviewed indicate illegal border crossings are down 67 percent , according to The Washington Times . By comparison , February statistics indicating the number of illegal alien apprehensions fell 40 percent .   " It ’s actually up to 67 percent drop compared to last year , " Aguilar told the Senate Homeland Security Committee . The former Border Patrol chief explained that similar decreases occurred during the Reagan Administration but later spiked in the decades to follow . Mr. Aguilar Aguilar comments were not immediately verified by U. S. Customs and Border Protection . The retired law enforcer ’s statement does , however , follow news previously reported by Breitbart Texas related to the mothballing of temporary holding facilities for the    surge of migrants throughout 2016 . In    a Rio Grande Valley Sector facility near the    Bravo International Bridge was closed after the prior month ’s Family Unit Aliens ( FMUA ) and Unaccompanied Alien Children ( UAC ) border apprehensions exhibited    tumbles . Days later , Breitbart Texas reported on a second overflow facility closure located about 40 miles east of El Paso . Both plants were placed in " warm standby " status capable of reversal in less than 24 hours . March 2017 figures have not yet been released by CBP .
