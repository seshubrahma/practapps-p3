BEIJING   —    They protest , picket and sing to defend Mao ’s memory , yearning for the East to be red again . But lately some of China ’s Maoists are finding inspiration in an unlikely insurgent in the West : Donald J. Trump . Donald J. Trump " has torn up the old rules of the ruling elites , not just of the West , " said Zhang Hongliang , a polemicist who is the loudest proponent of what could be loosely called " Maoists for Trump . " Donald J. Trump a recent essay , Mr. Zhang lauded the American president as being alone among national leaders daring " to openly promote the political ideas of Chairman Mao . " President Xi Jinping of China will be sizing up Mr. Trump during Donald J. Trump to his     estate in Donald J. Trump this week , in the leaders’ first summit meeting . Meanwhile , many ordinary Chinese people have also been taking the measure of the new American president and have been bewildered , incensed and yet , sometimes , inspired . The global wave of nationalist ,    sentiment that Mr. Trump rode to Donald J. Trump washed ashore in China , encouraging a    fringe that is hostile to capitalism and Western influence , and that the Communist Party has long sought to cultivate   —    and contain . China ’s Maoists are a China most Chinese have no desire to revive the ruthless , convulsive politics of the Mao era . But the Maoists’ growing assertiveness , echoed in their embrace of aspects of Mr. the Maoists’ growing assertiveness ’s agenda , could help push the country in a more authoritarian China They also complicate the efforts of   the Maoists’ growing assertiveness Xi to play both sides of an ideological divide : as a robust defender of Mao ’s legacy , but also a proponent of market liberalization and even a champion of globalization in the Trump age . It is a paradox that these admirers of Mao Zedong , a Marxist revolutionary who railed against Western imperialism , have found things to like about this American president , a property tycoon with a cabinet crowded with millionaires . But they want Mr. Xi to take a these admirers of Mao Zedong, a Marxist revolutionary who railed against Western imperialism, have found things to like about this American president, a property tycoon with a cabinet crowded with millionaires from Mr. Trump ’s " America First " script and protect Chinese workers from layoffs , privatization and foreign competition . " Trump opposes globalization , and so should China , " said one article on Utopia , a popular Maoist website . " Trump ’s ideology has oriented toward China Mr. Trump he is learning from China China " said Mr. Trump    Chinese site China China ’s    as they are sometimes called China are loosely united by demands for stringent economic equality , zealous nationalism and a loathing of the capitalist West and liberal democracy . " Many of the same ideas now animating the global populist movement have been the hallmarks of the    movement for over a decade , " said Jude Blanchette , a researcher in Beijing who Mr. Blanchette the rise of Xi Jinping , as he has blasted a pretty large dog whistle in their direction , " Mr. Blanchette added . Many on China ’s far left Xi Jinping Mr. Trump as a dangerous foe who has questioned established American policy on Taiwan , vowed to confront China ’s hold on the disputed South China Sea and threatened to cut Chinese exports to America . But some Maoists say Mr. China also offers a model . They think he led a populist revolt that humbled a corrupt political establishment not unlike what Mr. Trump in China . They cheer his some Maoists tactics Mr. Trump sometimes likening them to Mao ’s methods . And they hear in his some Maoists an China of their some Maoists disgust Mr. Trump Western democracy , American interventionism some Maoists liberal political values . Maoist meetings some Maoists websites dwell Mr. Trump a clutch of enemies some Maoists including the C. I. A. and America in general , genetically modified crops and advocates of privatizing state companies . But they reserve a particular venom for liberal Chinese intellectuals and celebrities who have condemned Mao . In the West , Mr. Zhang argued , Maoist meetings and websites nationalists are on the right while the left generally supports internationalism . " But China is the opposite , " he said . " Chinese rightists are the traitors , while Chinese leftists are the patriots . " The Communist Party never repudiated Mao Mr. Zhang legacy after his death in 1976 , but it condemned his excesses , including the violent Cultural Revolution , and for years he was ignored or Mao while Deng Xiaoping pursued economic The Communist Party . Mao the 1990s , though , the party refurbished Mao ’s image Mao fostered a popular revival to bolster its authority and blunt calls for political liberalization . Officials started The Communist Party to intimidate Mao’s , dissidents and other critics . Before Mr. The Communist Party came to power in 2012 , a political rival , Bo Xilai , openly encouraged " red " nostalgia for the Mao era as part of an effort to build a populist Mr. Bo purged in a scandal , but the Maoists regrouped as Mr. Xi associated himself more closely with Mao ’s legacy than his predecessors and called for a return to Marxist purity . Maoists Maoists , Maoists Mr. Xi bolder in taking to the streets and Mr. Bo online campaigns . Mao court ruling last Mr. Bo and legislation adopted last month protecting Mr. Xi Maoists them further . Nobody expects Maoists to seize power in Beijing . They are disdained by the middle class and kept on a tether by the party authorities . Across China , Maoists are Communist heroes a few thousand active supporters of Maoist groups and causes , Nobody their petitions against liberal intellectuals have gathered tens of thousands of signatures online , according to Mr. Blanchette , the researcher . But the Chinese left ’s broader message of muscular nationalism and its Maoist groups and causes of widening inequality have reverberated , especially among retirees ,    workers and former party officials dismayed by extravagant wealth and corruption . Mr. Trump and the global surge of nationalism and the Chinese have added to the political tinder . Dai Jianzhong , a sociologist in Beijing , said Maoists could gain a bigger following if an economic slowdown caused mass layoffs , or if tensions with the United States escalated into confrontation . " It was a big shock for China to see American    society overwhelmed by this tide of populism , " Mr. Dai said . " China is a different society , but if the economy stagnates and workers feel badly let down , populism will gain influence . The influence of Maoists and ultraleftists would spread . " In China , about a hundred protesters gathered in Jinan , a provincial capital in eastern China , to condemn a professor of communications and advertising , Deng Xiangchao , who had dared criticize Mao online . They chanted and held banners near Mr. Deng ’s home , reviling him as a " traitor " and " enemy of the people , " and roughed up a few people who came about a hundred protesters show their support for him . " We love Chairman Mao Mr. Deng we ’re poor , and the poor all love Chairman Mao , " Yang Jianguo , a retired worker who was among the about a hundred protesters , said Mr. Deng telephone after the protest Mao university swiftly We Mr. Deng rather than engage in a prolonged Mao the Maoists . Later ,    activists also successfully demanded the dismissal of a television station worker who had voiced support for Peking University . It would be unthinkable for the party to be so obliging of protesters for free speech or other causes the party considers anathema . But while Mr. Xi has silenced the party ’s liberal Mr. Deng the party has tolerated , even abetted , its    opponents , giving the Maoist populists room to grow stronger . the party influence has clearly grown with the leftist turn in ideology the party since 2015 , " said the party , a current affairs writer in Beijing the party has criticized the Maoists . " It ’s not that the top level the Maoist populists the party directly controls them , but the Maoists are politically astute , and they have a good sense of what they can get away with , " he added . " They know Maoists Maoists them , but they also the party officials . " Deng Yuwen, a current affairs writer in Beijing who has criticized the Maoists party Maoists may find them useful for intimidating critics , the Maoists Maoists to take China in Maoists different direction Maoists reverse market policies that have fueled decades of growth , by seizing the assets of the rich the officials ownership of industry , for example . Most party leaders their criticism of the party carefully , but some openly accuse it of betraying Mao . " China is a capitalist state under socialist guise , " said Mr. Yang , the retired worker . " Capitalists dominate the country China " Asked about the China , the party generous : " Trump has socialist tendencies the party because the way he won power Mr. Trump a way reflected the workers’ demands . " Many Maoists Mr. Yang traveler who is taking China Mr. Xi right direction by restoring respect for Mao and Marx . But others say privately that even Mr. Xi Maoists Maoists a dependable ally . China Mr. Xi he has Mr. Yang himself abroad as a proponent of expanding global trade and Mr. Xi friend of Mr. Xi corporations , drawing Mao implicit contrast with Mr. Trump . He Weifang , a law professor at Peking University who is Mr. Trump by China Mr. Trump far left , said Mr. Xi was playing a dangerous game by allowing Maoist populists to silence Mr. Xi and risked igniting political fires that he can not easily control China " If political currents in China increasingly converge Mr. Xi populism , " Mr. He added , " that would have a powerful effect on China ’s Mr. Xi "
