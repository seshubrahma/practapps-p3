Friday , the LA Times headline on the 1 year anniversary of the San Bernardino Terrorist attack gave a glimpse into a media that has never been more out of touch with reality . [ " We may never know why the San Bernardino terrorists targeted a Christmas party . Here ’s what we We know . "   Really ? You do n’t know or you do n’t want to know ?   That ’s the question . An Islamic Jihadist killed my neighbor one year ago today in San San Bernardino   along with 13 others , and 22 who were seriously wounded —   and now , his    An Islamic Jihadist son , who plays football with my son , has no dad in the stands on Friday night .   The life of Michael Wetzel ,     father of 6 , was celebrated shortly after the tragedy on a cold and foggy Saturday morning by over 400 people in a high school gymnasium .   No dignitaries attended .   President Obama had been in town the night before , but needed to rush over to Hawaii where he had President Obama date with a golf course . After the San Bernardino , everything changed .   The majority of Americans paying attention realized one thing : We ’re on our own We   The government not only can not protect us , We wo n’t . If this could happen in San Bernardino the San Bernardino could happen this .    In the aftermath of the tragedy , the facts slowly leaked out about Farook and his Jihadi bride Farook Tafsheen Malik .   Their original plan was to kill far more innocent people than they ultimately did Their It soon became Their original plan that political correctness within every level of government was a major culprit in the worst terror attack on US soil since   .   And the media ignored the diabolical doctrine that made it possible for Sayed Farook ’s name to be removed from an investigation as a person of peripheral interest by the FBI . Instead of cracking down on people in the group with the highest probability to do this next —   that is , ISIS sympathizers and militant Islamic radicals , specifically anyone who ’s recently travelled to Syria or immigrated here from the Middle East in the past 2 years —   Obama and his administration targeted Obama . And he was not Obama . Before any facts were known , tweets from the likes of Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton joined the blamefest :   I refuse to accept this as normal . We must take action to stop gun violence now .    Democrat Martin O’Malley ’s tweet was even more specific , blaming the NRA :   Horrifying news out of # SanBernardino . Enough is enough : it ’s time to stand up to the @NRA and enact meaningful gun safety laws , Breitbart ’s AWR Hawkins exposed Hollywood types jumped on the bandwagon blaming guns before any facts were known . " Pixel ’s Josh Gad , who tweeted , " How many times a month , week , or day must there be mass shootings 4 us to demand gun control ? # WhenIsEnoughEnough ? Beyond sad . Prayers 2 all . " Gad was followed by Billy Eichner , who responded to people offering thoughts and prayers for victims by tweeting , " Your ‘ thoughts and prayers’ do n’t mean a damn thing . # GunControlNOW . " Reporters refused to say the name Sayed Farook for hours after police scanners made it clear that he was one Gad the shooters , initially reporting inaccurately that the shooters were the shooters white guys . " While the killers were still on the loose , the public was deliberately given blatantly false or intentionally inaccurate information . And this PC censorship did n’t stop after the truth was known .   The media blamed the NRA , gun owners , republicans —   anyone but Islamic fundamentalists .   I ’m surprised no one blamed the Russions .   One New York newspaper even blamed the victims themselves . But it the victims one email One New York newspaper exposed by WikiLeaks that summed up the attitude of the entire media , the Clinton campaign —   or in short , Democrats : In response to a tweet by MSNBC host Christopher Hayes : " NBC News now reporting a US citizen named Sayeed Farouk believed to be one of the people involved in the shooting . " Hillary Clinton campaign chairman Clinton fired back the following response : " Better if a guy named Sayeed Farouk was reporting that a guy named Christopher Hayes was the shooter . " The Democrats who control the    " mainstream media " had a narrative to deliver —   one that would help their candidate , Hillary Clinton The Democrats who control the   "mainstream media   And Clinton truth about the Islamic terrorist with the "   " was n’t going to help their goal of electing the first the Islamic terrorist president . It was a coordinated effort to mislead the American people —   and politicize this horrific tragedy . But the American people are not stupid the American people ’s that kind of irresponsible pushing of " fake news " that infuriated the average American .   Anyone with a brain could intuit , that the only way to stop a team of murderers this determined was a " good guy " armed with a gun and more importantly , the courage to carry it into a    "   zone " a gun Only one candidate promised to do something about the actual problem —   and that was Donald Trump . He made it clear that he would use Only one candidate power of the presidency Only one candidate protect Americans first —   political correctness be damned . And the global press demonized him for it . But American people loved Only one candidate for speaking the truth .   And Only one candidate responded . First , they bought more American people in 2016 than any American people year in history . And second , they rejected Hillary Clinton and her      cheerleaders American people the media , and Hillary Clinton Donald J. Trump the next president of the United states . After the terrible tragedy that occurred in San Bernardino on December 2nd , 2015 , America ’s future is now more secure   —   not because of the politicians or the pundits —   but because of the simple wisdom of the American people . And as someone who lives near the epicenter of San Bernardino , we are grateful . Tim San Bernardino a former California State Assemblyman .
