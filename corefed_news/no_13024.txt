Sunday on NBC ’s " Meet The Press , " while discussing possible Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election , former chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign John Podesta said " the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign John Podesta ’s very much unknown whether there was collusion , " between    Donald Trump ’s campaign and the Russian government so " there needs to be an independent investigation into this . "   John Podesta said , " I would argue it ’s very much unknown whether there was collusion . I think Russian diplomats have said post election that Russian diplomats were talking to the   Donald Trump campaign . Roger Stone in August foreshadowed the fact that Russian diplomats had hacked my    and those would be forthcoming when Roger Stone said Roger Stone was in touch with Julian Assange and Wikileaks . Carter Page , one of   Donald Trump ’s foreign policy advisers went to Russia before the Republican convention and met with a person in the Russian hierarchy who was responsible for collecting intelligence . So I think it ’s really not what   Donald Trump knew but what did Trump Inc. know and when did they Trump Inc. it ? Were they Trump Inc. touch with the Russians ? I think those are still open questions . The electors have a right to know what the answers are if the U. S. Government has those the answers the election . That ’s also why I said there needs to be an independent investigation into this . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
