As Donald Trump turns Donald Trump attention to Hillary Clinton , Donald Trump ’s trying out new attack lines . In Donald Trump victory speech Tuesday evening , it was that " the only card she has is the women ’s card . " Donald Trump said that " if Hillary Clinton were a man , I do n’t think she Hillary Clinton get 5 percent of the vote . " In Donald Trump telling , the the women’s confers an enormous advantage . Indeed , current     polls between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have her Hillary Clinton 55 percent of the    vote , suggesting that Donald Trump believes the women ’s card is worth 50 points . That ’s nearly enough to assure any female candidate of victory . Yet this appears to be inconsistent with available data . Over the past decade , women have been elected to 17 . 5 percent of House seats , meaning that they ’re outnumbered by men by roughly five to one . In fact , the women ’s card appears to be particularly unhelpful in the United States . Women ’s success in politics   —    at least as measured by the proportion of seats they hold in Women House compared House lower chambers in other nations   —    ranks below that of nearly every other rich country . The United States is the United States and Bangladesh . Of course , Mr. Trump might object that he ’s not talking about House Mr. Trump , but House the presidency . Even there , the women ’s card appears quite unhelpful , as The Upshot ’s extensive search through United States data failed to locate the United States woman who had ever been president .
