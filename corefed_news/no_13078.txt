Thursday on Fox News Channel ’s " Hannity , " former House Speaker Newt Gingrich criticized current House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) for current House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) lack of endorsement of likely presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump earlier in the day in an interview with CNN .   former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told host Sean Hannity it was a " big mistake " and that it sets the wrong tone for the rest of the Republican Party . " [ I]n the case of Paul Ryan Paul Ryan made a big mistake today and Paul Ryan needs to understand this , " former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said . " Paul Ryan is the Speaker of the House . Paul Ryan has an obligation to unify the Republican Party . He Paul Ryan an obligation to reach out . Obviously he Paul Ryan Donald Trump are going to have disagreements . Some of them he and Donald Trump work out and some of them he and Donald Trump Some of them n’t . That ’s fine . Our constitution provides that speakers and presidents can fight , but I think he Our constitution the wrong signal and a signal which I think endangers the House Republicans and endangers the Senate Republicans . " " I much prefer what Mitch McConnell did , what John McCain did   —   they both said , ‘ OK game ’s over , we they both a nominee . I ’m for him,’ " he a nominee . " And I think Paul Ryan has some obligation institutionally to be responsive to the fact that the people of the party he Paul Ryan to have chosen a nominee . And frankly in the long history of American politics , Donald Trump is not outrageously outside the norm . This kind of vitriol you get does not reflect accurately people who have been nominated for president over the last 200 years . Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
