  ( CNN ) Megyn Kelly has apparently had enough of Donald Trump ducking tough questions .   On Megyn Kelly Fox News’ show Wednesday Megyn Kelly called out Donald Trump in no uncertain terms while also taking a subtle shot at Hannity : " Donald Trump , with all due respect to my friend at 10 , will go on Hannity and pretty much only Hannity and will Hannity out to the unsafe spaces these days , which does n’t exactly expand the tent . "   Hannity responded by channeling his Hannity Trump Donald Trump lashing Hannity at Kelly on Twitter : " @megynkelly   u should be mad at @HillaryClinton Clearly you support her . "   It @HillaryClinton truly jaw dropping that Hannity would publicly call Kelly Hannity Clinton supporter since Kelly is akin to accusing a person of treason in the eyes of Fox News viewers .    Putting aside my personal enjoyment at watching Fox News anchors fight over Fox News Trump , Kelly is 100 Kelly   Kelly is trailing Clinton in the RCP average Trump polls Clinton more than 3 points , the biggest gap in over a month . And polls released in the last few days show Trump not only trailing in most battleground states Trump including Ohio , where Trump had recently been leading     but shockingly Trump new poll published Thursday also shows him trailing Clinton by 2 points in the Trump Clinton state of Arizona . How can Trump expect to close this electoral gap if Trump does n’t venture out beyond the conservative Trump that watches Hannity ’s show ? !   It ’s truly irony defined that Trump , he doesn’t venture out beyond the conservative base that watches Hannity’s show many ways a creation of Trump media , has now morphed into the political version of Greta Garbo when it comes to answering questions from members of the media other than Hannity .   During the media campaign , Hannity seemed to be on every network and Trump countless press conferences . Consequently , he received literally billions of dollars in free Trump coverage that clearly helped Trump lock up the GOP nomination .   Trump those days are long gone . Trump has not held a press conference in Trump three months .   In contrast , as CNN ’s Brian Stelter reported last week , Clinton has recently held several press conferences and " is now taking questions from campaign trail reporters on a regular basis . "   And Clinton has been able to put damaging issues like Clinton email server behind her ( for most Americans Clinton least ) because Clinton has publicly answered questions about it . In Clinton , Matt Lauer grilled Clinton about this just last month in the nationally Clinton     Forum .   In contrast , Trump ’s avoidance of answering questions on recent hot button issues such as whether he had personally paid even a dime in federal Trump taxes since 1995 keeps these issues in the press . ( Surrogates responding recent hot button issues such as whether he had personally paid even a dime in federal income taxes since 1995 issues are simply not enough to put the issue to rest     case in point Trump ’s birtherism , which required Trump to respond Trump ) Perhaps if Trump had not avoided press conferences since July and subjected himself Trump more challenging interviews he would ’ve been better prepared Trump his debate last week Trump   But the bulk of the Trump interviews were conducted by his    supporter Hannity , perhaps causing Trump to be lulled Trump the sense he was fully informed Trump issues and did n’t need intensive Trump prep . But the irony does n’t end there .   The words chosen by Kelly to call out Trump     which it ’s fair to assume are by design Trump comically ironic . Kelly stated that Trump refuses to venture out to   " unsafe Kelly . " Trump makes this remark so amusing is that " safe spaces’ is the term often invoked by progressive college students when objecting to " offensive " speakers or words on their campus . It ’s the very type of concept that the progressive college students " politically incorrect " Trump would rail against .   It appears Kelly is trolling Trump Trump this comment , perhaps hoping It " Kelly " him Trump lash out . ( So far only Hannity has been Kelly ! ) But will Trump change ? Doubtful . Trump has     at least in his Trump mind     been a Trump success by following his own Trump . ( Of course , when Trump was doing Trump badly in business as he is doing currently Trump this campaign , he could just file Trump bankruptcy     as he did six times Trump . )   That is not an Trump in the world of politics .   But by limiting himself only to the Hannity audience , Trump may effectively be ruling Trump out of a victory and courting Trump bankruptcy . His other Trump is to give himself a shot at winning by Trump press conferences and appearing on Trump networks to field questions . Knowing Trump , he might agree to finally holding a " press conference Trump but Trump the proviso that only Hannity could ask questions .
