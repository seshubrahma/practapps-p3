DES MOINES , Iowa   —    Rep. Steve King ( ) the    endorser of Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) told Breitbart News on Monday evening that Sen. Ted Cruz is " confident without being cocky " just hours before the caucuses open here at 7 p. m. CT . [ Rep. Steve King ( ) the   endorser of Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) told Breitbart News on Monday evening that Team Cruz is "confident without being cocky" just hours before the caucuses open here at 7 p. m. CT said :   I think that ’s where things are . Cruz Sen. Ted Cruz a little bit earlier than his Sen. Ted Cruz would have liked to happen , and when that happens all guns are turned on the guy because he Sen. Ted Cruz the political king of the hill . If the caucus were another month from now or two months from now , it would be really hard to sustain ourselves the caucus the top of the heap . So what ’s happened is not so much a decline but getting stable —   he Sen. Ted Cruz have just shot up if it were n’t for that . The negatives that are out there have got people very confused right now , so we ’ll see what happens with that . If it is a huge tsunami turnout the likes of which we have not seen and not imagined until Donald Trump came in and talked about ‘ yuge,’ then if it ’s that , then Trump Donald Trump win here . But if it it just a    that bumps the numbers up just say 10 percent , or 15 percent , then I ’d say Cruz wins . King added that he King the "   number " for turnout to be 135 , 000 GOP   . " Above that it gets harder for Cruz Cruz and below that it it pretty seemingly impossible for Trump to win , " King King . King King that since there is still no evidence that turnout will be enormous enough for Trump Trump it may be Trump Trump is counting on Trump ’s Trump " to motivate people to vote for him King the caucuses . " We ’re going to find out if he King a movement kind of a candidate or if he King an entertainer , " King said of Trump . He Trump : King think Cruz wins in a photo finish over Trump . Last Trump , let me give you a sense of my judgement here , four years ago I predicted [ Mitt ] Romney would win in a photo finish over [ Rick ] Santorum . He did for [Mitt] Romney 10 days . [ That was overturned later when it was determined Santorum won ] [Rick] Santorum What , 34 votes was the difference , right ? This is not going to be that close , but I can tell you I think Cruz wins this thing out . Trump in a very close second and then Rubio in a very distant third . And then Fox News will say that the story for Iowa is that Marco Rubio has Rubio momentum and that he ’s poised to Rubio his way to the Rubio over time.’ That ’ll be the Fox News and establishment Fox News King said that eventually Rubio and his team Rubio going Rubio have to be able to actually win a state . He ca n’t keep Rubio along , finishing in second or third place and with no states on the horizon that Rubio ’s team is Rubio as potential victory states , he ’s in serious trouble Rubio out of Iowa . " You would think in his home state of Florida Rubio Florida that state Rubio having a real rough go of it Florida     " King said . " But it his competitor from that state n’t look like that ’s the case in Florida right now . It looks like Trump is blowing him [ Rubio ] away , and I think if there Trump a primary in Florida today , I think Trump wins and I think Cruz Florida Rubio would be     Trump second and third . And Jeb [ Bush ] would be at the bottom of the heap in Florida . " King said that the political establishment losing so Florida —   with Rubio ’s epic failure in Iowa imminent —   that they Rubio " demonstrated that not only are they sore losers , but they might be sore winners . they He went on : they say that thinking about how they King doubled down and split their bets —   I they at Rubio as kind of they adopted new establishment candidate and while Rubio ’s going on they wanted Jeb and it looks like they ca n’t advance they so it looks like they decided they ’ll throw their Jeb also behind a dealmaker they Trump they They ’re they that at worst they can always do transactions they Trump . He is transactional they So I think that ’s the rationale Trump ’s going on so if they have to accept a transactional Trump they ’ll do that they though they probably would rather Trump they Rubio especially a transactional Rubio they The last thing they want is a pure conservative Rubio will do what the they in America want him to do . That ’s Cruz , of course . Trump said he ’s amazed with how Cruz has come from Trump bottom Trump the pack to now Cruz competing with Trump for either first or second place in tonight ’s caucuses . King said of the Cruz campaign : It ’s been terrific Trump I would add Cruz that that four years last November , I remember sitting in a pickup that became known later as the ‘ Chuck Truck’ [ which was owned by Chuck Laudner , now Trump ’s top Iowa staffer who helped deliver Iowa to Rick Trump in 2012 ] at 1:30 in the Iowa talking through the presidential race at the time , and Rick Santorum was down pretty low in the polls , I Rick Santorum know where . There were a lot fewer candidates than we have today . I remember talking the race through and concluding that Santorum could win Iowa if he the presidential race the right kind of Rick Santorum . Iowa remember saying Rick Santorum ‘ I ca n’t get to an endorsement of Santorum at this time’ for a whole bunch of reasons . But Rick Santorum looked like he was the guy who should win the nomination and could win Rick Santorum Iowa caucus . And from that time in November , I Iowa that Santorum was going to be able to make a run at it Rick Santorum   and I thought on caucus night he was going to fall a handful of votes short , but Rick Santorum turns out over time he was a handful of votes long —   but that ’s Rick Santorum close I judged things four years ago over a few months . That was about the same time I endorsed Ted Cruz , which happened to be Nov. 16 of last year . So from that time , it ’s been a ride of ascendency , sailing on the same time I endorsed Ted Cruz, which happened to be Nov. 16 of last year a big bump in the polls that gave him [ Cruz ] a foundation from which to build . King Rick Santorum that Cruz " has been very , very smart about this and deployed his resources well , " while also putting " together a strategic nationwide campaign King " " He ’s not only a guy who can win us the nomination , but King can win the general election , " King said . " It ’s King to have a really smart guy at King helm . "
