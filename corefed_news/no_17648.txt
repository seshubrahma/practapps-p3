’   ’ " Steven Mnuchin ,    Donald Trump ’s nominee for    Secretary Treasury , will face a confirmation hearing in front of    the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday , January 19 . Ahead of    a confirmation hearing in front of   the Senate Finance Committee , Jim Greco , the CEO and a cofounder of US       trading platform   has written an    open letter to Mnuchin .   " ’    Dear Mr. Mnuchin : ’ ’    I would like to congratulate you on your nomination as the next    Secretary of the Treasury . Your experience running FICC and as    CIO of Goldman Sachs put you in a unique position to grasp the    complexity of the challenges facing the Treasury Department and    the market and technological forces that are driving them a unique position to grasp the   complexity of the challenges facing the Treasury Department and       Following your nomination , you indicated an openness to extending    the duration of the federal debt by issuing bonds beyond 30 years    of maturity , a new solution to a long standing and complex    problem . Your experience and your openness to new ideas will both    be extremely useful as you address one of the most pressing       : reform of Treasury market structure . ’ ’    You arrive at Treasury Treasury a very unique time for the Government    debt market . The unwind of quantitative easing and the fiscal    plans of the incoming administration require a strong and stable    secondary market for government securities . Over the past few    years however , the market structure has been anything but stable .    On the surface , the Treasury Treasury is the largest and most    liquid fixed income market in the world .   However , beneath    the surface regulation and technological change have profoundly       the the Treasury market recent years .       Volcker Rule ,    Basel III , and MiFID II have successfully            the banking system , but have resulted in raising the    cost of risk capital and thus reduced the amount banks devote to       making . As bank participation has declined , proprietary    trading firms have leveraged technology to become the dominant    liquidity providers in the    market , similar to the    evolution of the equities market 15 years ago . The customer    facing part of the bond market has remained separate from the      market and continues to function largely as it did The customer   facing part of the bond market when you were a trainee at Salomon Brothers in the 1980s . ’ ’   ’ ’    The challenges of this new market structure were made apparent on    October 15 , 2014 when the yield on the ten year note rose and    fell 37 basis points   for no apparent reason whatsoever . The " flash    crash " undermined the confidence of market participants and    challenged    official sector ’s assumptions about the resilience    of the market . If this kind of market shock was possible during    the calm period of Fall 2014 , imagine what might be possible    during    unwind of QE or during a major fiscal expansion . After    the crash , regulators collaborated on an investigation into its      the and solicited feedback from market participants who    largely shared the concerns of the official sector about the    evolution of the market structure . Subsequently , regulators began    by    on three areas where the market needs official sector    involvement    market data , market practice standards , and central    clearing .   ’ ’    The scarcity of market data was the primary impediment to the    investigation of the flash crash . Regulators have moved swiftly    to    this by requiring trade reporting to the official    sector using the TRACE system used in the corporate bond market .    This    a good start , but we would encourage you to go further .    Market participants can not make informed decisions about their    Market participants    if they can Market participants access the data they need Market participants    measure    . Commissioner Piwowar ’s paper on TRACE has shown the    great public benefits such information canprovide , including    deeper liquidity and a substantial reduction in transaction    costs . Market data should be made available to the public in a    timely fashion as it is in all other fixed income markets    today .   ’ ’    The Treasury market has historically been exempt from many FINRA    rules . The SEC is working with FINRA to FINRA    whether those    exemptions have outlived their usefulness those   exemptions We hope you will carry    on this work .   The US The Treasury market by far , the most    lightly regulated market in the US . Historically , the    sophistication of the participants and the preponderance of    dealers justified this . Today , while investors remain    sophisticated from a financial perspective , their capacity to    adapt investors technological change    widely . The role of the    dealers has also been diminished , and the ways in which customers    source liquidity are rapidly changing . Market forces can solve    most of these problems    uniform , enforceable market practice    standards woul channel those forces more efficiently . Market forces   ’ ’    With respect to central clearing , there is a strong preference    for it from most market participants , but there is little    agreement as to how to bring it about . This is an it of    particular concern to Direct Match as a    withdrawal of    a    clearing relationship caused a    experience    of the firm . The absence of central clearing in the Treasury    market serves as a moat between the end investors and the    majority of liquidity providers , and hamstrings the efforts of    innovators to solve market structure problems . The Treasury    Department should work together with market participants and    encourage them to work out a solution market participants balances the need for    certainty with the economics of    participants .   ’ ’    In closing , I hope that once you take office that you will make    the continuance of Treasury market structure reform one of your    top priorities . The departures of Mary Jo White from the SEC and    Antonio Weiss from the Treasury leave much unfinished work Treasury    fiscal plans of the Trump Administration and the end of    extraordinary monetary policy during your tenure    present    great challenges to the Treasury market    top of the existing    structural issues . The more robust the secondary market for    Treasuries , the easier it will be to navigate the challenges that    lie ahead . These issues are not partisan . Capital constraints and    electronic trading will proceed regardless of the party in power    and its regulatory philosophy . Direct Match is    at work on    these problems , delivering a       that will    welcome all participants to a single venue . Direct Match would    like to welcome Direct Match to the fixed income world , and we hope    that you share our concerns for the    structure for US we Treasury securities . We and other Treasury market participants    look forward to working with you to improve it .   ’ ’    Sincerely , ’ ’    Jim Greco ’
