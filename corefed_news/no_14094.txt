  ( CNN ) Tom Brady has opened up on Tom Brady friendship with Donald Trump , but it ’s not a subject Tom Brady appears to want to delve into much further . Brady , a day after leading the Patriots back to another Super Bowl , spoke about Tom Brady relationship with Donald Trump on Tom Brady weekly appearance on WEEI ’s Kirk and Callahan show . According to Trump , who made the remarks at a    dinner that included Patriots owner Robert Kraft , Brady called the new president to offer Brady congratulations before the inauguration . On Monday , Brady was asked if Brady would confirm Brady had called Brady . " I have called Brady , yes , in the past , " Brady said . " Sometimes Brady calls me . Sometimes I call Brady . But , again , that ’s been someone I ’ve known . I always try to keep it in context because for 16 years you know someone before maybe Brady was in the position that Brady was in . Brady ’s been very supportive of me for a long time . It ’s just a friendship . I have a lot of friends . I call a lot of people . " Brady added : " Why does that make such a big deal ? I do n’t understand that . " Brady then was asked on the show about having conversations with women who may not like Trump . " I do n’t want to get into it , but if you know someone , it does n’t mean you agree with everything they say or they do , " Brady said . " You have a lot of friends in your life . I think there are things that are based in your own dealings with someone that is a personal dealing , not a public dealing . Because you have personal experiences . "
