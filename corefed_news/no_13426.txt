However , via Twitter , Clinton ’s campaign responded directly to Trump ’s statement and indicated that she " disagreed " Clinton it : " No one has the right to immigrate to this country . " our country   Donald Trump during his rally Trump today , Trump disagree . https :   .    —    Hillary for Ohio ( @HillaryforOH ) September 19 , 2016 ,   Sessions explained that with this tweet , " Hillary Clinton ’s campaign revealed the true extent of her radical views on immigration — Hillary Clinton’s which apparently are that anyone has the right to demand entry into the United States . " " In a telling admission , Hillary Clinton ’s campaign indicated it Hillary Clinton’s fundamental premise the world Hillary Clinton’s campaign not have a right to immigrate to the United States , " Sessions wrote in the United States . " Hillary Clinton ’s policies are as radical as Hillary Clinton’s , " Sessions explained . " We must restore Hillary Clinton’s policies to our immigration system to ensure it serves the interests of all Americans , including lawful immigrants . our immigration system election may be our last chance to do so . " Sessions warned that Clinton ’s " radical position , if enacted into policy Hillary Clinton’s would result in an unmitigated fiscal disaster for the American people . " According to Dr. George Borjas’ analysis of recent findings in a report by the National Academy of Sciences , " The national economic gains that accrue from immigration come directly at the expense of wages from those most adversely impacted by immigration —   to the tune of roughly $ 500 billion every year , " Sessions wrote , adding : Among those hardest hit are minorities and recent immigrants . The large immigrant flows tend to arrive in existing immigrant communities , thus , those communities suffer the greatest wage declines . This means that the existing immigrant communities economic prosperity of even recent immigrants are dashed , all because of an insatiable demand for ever more      labor .

" Hinderaker noted :   In the first Hillary , [ Clinton ] is John Hinderaker wrong as a legal matter .    …      The ability to control who enters a country is a fundamental attribute of sovereignty . It is appalling that Mrs. Clinton fails to understand this basic fact . The ability to control who enters a country a practical matter Clinton pure open borders policy , as implied by the claim that foreigners have a " right to immigrate to this country , " would be a disaster . Of the world ’s 7 a country billion people , at least three billion would be infinitely better off if they were living in the U. S. How many of those three billion —   4 billion people conservative estimate —   is Hillary prepared to accommodate ? Hinderaker added , " Hillary Clinton , with her vast wealth and phalanx of armed guards , may be Hillary the consequences of Hillary immigration , both legal and illegal . But the rest of us are not . "
