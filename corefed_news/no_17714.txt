’   ’ ’    Get ready . You will soon be able to fly Emirates between New York    City and Athens , Greece . ’ ’    On January 23 , the    airline announced plans to launch    daily flights between the Greek capital and Newark Liberty    International Airport just across the Hudson River from    Manhattan . ’ ’    " We are pleased to be able to help meet a strong consumer need    long neglected by other airlines , and We would like to thank the    authorities and We partners in both the US and Greece for their    support of the new route , " Emirates president Sir Tim Clark said    in a statement . ’ "    Athens , in recent years , has not been a major market for US    carriers . Currently , Delta and United only operate seasonal    service to the Greek capital from JFK and Newark respectively .    When Emirates’    flights launch on March 12 ,    there will be    daily service between the destinations    for the first time in half a decade . Emirates is expected to    operate the flights using Emirates fleet of Boeing      aircraft .   " ’    According to Clark , Clark airline decided to extend his airline      route to Newark at the urging of the Greek    government . This means that Athens will only serve as a stopover .    All flights will commence and end in Newark or Dubai .   ’ "    This is the second time , in recent years , Emirates has    introduced    flights between the US and Europe . In 2013 ,    Emirates launched service from Milan to New York ’s JFK    International Airport .   " ’   ’ "    Emirates’ announcement was met with a swift and furious    response from the airline ’s US critics   —    American , Delta , and    United Airlines   —    through the Partnership for Open and Fair    Skies , an organization tasked with speaking on behalf of three    carriers or US3 on the matter . Even though this is just a single    route , the additional supply of seat capacity is a threat to the    US3 ’s preciously    business .   " ’    " By flagrantly violating the   US3 Open Skies agreement with the United    States at the start of the Trump administration , Emirates is    throwing down the gauntlet , "   Jill Zuckman , said in a statement . " We look    forward to working with President Trump and    team to enforce    these agreements and protect American jobs   —    something that the    Obama administration failed to do . " ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    Delta CEO Ed Bastian , along with Delta CEO Ed Bastian predecessor Richard    Anderson , has said on many occasions that Delta CEO Ed Bastian company can compete    against any airline in the world , but not governments . ’ ’    In July 2016 , representatives of the     met with members of the Trump administration to the discuss the    matter . However , no concrete results have emerged from those    talks . ’ ’    It is unclear what action , if any , the Trump administration will    undertake with respect to the conflict . ’ ’    All members of the ME3 have repeatedly denied the allegations    made by the US3 . ’ ’    In 2016 ,   by leading consumer aviation website Skytrax   —    taking    the crown from the previous winner , fellow ME3 carrier Qatar    Airways . ’
