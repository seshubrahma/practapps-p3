The annual Bilderberg meeting is definitely an exclusive affair , whether The annual Bilderberg meeting ’s seen as an opportunity for the world ’s power players to informally converse about important global trends , or just a secret gathering of the Illuminati puppet masters who    history to suit the Illuminati puppet masters who   history mysterious agenda . [ " No minutes will be taken . No reporters will be allowed in . There will be no opening press conference , no closing statement , and participants will be asked not to quote each other , " the UK Independent says of the 64th Bilderberg Conference , which began on Thursday at the Taschenbergpalais hotel in Dresden , Germany .   the UK Independent explains that much of the secrecy that fuels conspiracy theories is meant to avoid difficult encounters with the press , a prospect that might otherwise keep many influential guests from attending : " No one wants the Danish minister of justice or the deputy prime minister of Turkey to have to field awkward questions , such as : ‘ Where do you stand on corporate lobbying?’ Especially when they ’re corporate lobbying?’ between the chairman of HSBC and the president of Siemens . " The Guardian thinks it fair The Guardian describe the meeting as a gigantic " corporate lobbying event , " a fact made obvious by the energetic corporate sponsorship of the event a gigantic "corporate lobbying event All those finance ministers sitting round discussing the ‘ geopolitics of energy and commodity prices’ with the group chief executive of BP , the    of Portuguese petroleum giant Galp Energia , and the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell . And then afterwards saying nothing to their respective parliaments about what they discussed . their respective parliaments ’s so     inappropriate that it beggars comprehension . " Among the attendees will be Henry Kissinger , who the Guardian ’s Charlie Skelton does not like very much . " The ageless     former US secretary of state will be holding court at Dresden , croaking out his wisdom from The ageless    former US secretary of state throne of bones he has shipped The ageless    former US secretary of state he goes . The ageless    former US secretary of state just ca n’t keep a bad man down , " Skelton hisses . Charlie Skelton Bilderberg organization releases its guest list The Bilderberg organization the public every year , so the attendees are no mystery . It ’s a The Bilderberg organization even mix of politicians , corporate titans , and the lobbyists who bring them together in matrimony . A few other names beside Kissinger stand out .   Former CIA head David Petraeus will be there , no doubt taking a bit of    ribbing in the locker room for being unable to get away with handling classified documents the way Hillary Clinton does . Gawker Media will be delighted to see its nemesis Peter Gawker Media in attendance . The U. S. legislature will be represented by Lindsey Graham ( ) . You do n’t suppose they ’ll be The U. S. legislature the U. S. presidential race behind closed doors , do you ? Some notable academics will make the trip to Dresden , including history professor Niall Ferguson of Harvard , Hudson Institute senior fellow    Kravis , and Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute . The U. S. media is actually quite    on the guest list : Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum , NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel , Bloomberg View ’s Megan McArdle , Bloomberg LP     John Micklethwait , and Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan . If one of the topics discussed at Bilderberg does prove to be uploading Henry Kissinger ’s brain into a giant computer , it will most one of the topics discussed at Bilderberg does prove to be uploading Henry Kissinger’s brain into a giant computer be handled by Alex Karp , CEO of Palantir Technologies , assuming Thiel is too busy hunting the last survivors of Gawker for sport . The Guardian even describes Karp as " Alex Karp bit like a younger , more hippyish Kissinger , " which makes him sound perfect Alex Karp the job .   LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman will also be there , and we ’d best hope he is n’t LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman one who turns uploads Kissinger ’s brain Kissinger an immortal digital demigod , or everyone on Earth is about to get    with LinkedIn connection emails .    will not feel pity , or remorse , or fear , and it absolutely will not stop , ever , until you respond to its LinkedIn request it There will , of course , be a lot of money represented at the meeting . As previously noted , some    oil company executives will be on hand , along with Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan and his supervisory board John Cryan Paul M. Achleitner , executive board member Benoit Couere of the European Central Bank , Vernon E. Jordan Jr. of asset management firm Lazard Freres   Co. LLC , CEO Rudolf Scholten of Oesterreichische Kontrollbank , and Bjorn Wahlroos of Nordea Bank . Deutsche Bank notes that a few political rising stars have emerged from Bilderberg conferences in the past , including Arkansas governor Bill Clinton in 1991 , and U. K. shadow minister Tony Blair in 1993 . " Conference organisers have previously insisted there is no conspiracy to crowbar their chosen people into Conference organisers jobs , they just have excellent Conference organisers spotters . " In addition to Clinton chum Vernon Jordan , ZeroHedge notes that many of the Bilderberg attendees have paid Hillary Clinton millions in Clinton , and suspects the presence of Lindsey Graham is another sign that helping Clinton prevail over Donald Trump Clinton be a " prominent topic of discussion . " ZeroHedge also observes that secret ZeroHedge whose names do not appear on the official guest list are not unheard of , suggesting that German Chancellor Angela Merkel might be one such quiet attendee this year , given that Europe ’s migrant crisis is on the agenda .
