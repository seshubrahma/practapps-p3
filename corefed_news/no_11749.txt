In order to defeat Donald Trump ,   The Weekly Standard ’s Bill Kristol admits Bill Kristol is prepared to hand Hillary Clinton the Oval Office . On Wednesday ’s " Morning Joe , " the Republican Establishment leader laid out the Republican Establishment leader plot to deprive Trump of the 50 % of delegates necessary to secure the nomination . From there , the idea is to go into a brokered convention and cut a kamikaze deal that awards enough delegates to an " acceptable " candidate ( who will have won far fewer votes , states , and delegates than Trump ) .   The problem with the Establishment brokering a     deal that hands the nomination to a Marco Rubio , is that the backlash against the Republican Party is almost certain to hand Hillary Clinton the presidency . If a bunch of rich , angry GOP elites rob Trump) supporters of angry GOP elites victory , the blowback will result in so many voters staying home in November , Hillary Clinton wins . As NBC ’s Chuck Todd pointed out last night , at this point the delegate math is such that the only way to stop Trump) is through this scheme at the convention . As you ’ll see below , that outcome is preferable to Kristol , and by extension that outcome is safe to assume that outcome is also fine with the rest of the Republican Establishment . JOE SCARBOROUGH : The fact of the matter is that you know there is no historical precedent with someone doing as well as Candidate Trump did yesterday   —    winning New Hampshire , South Carolina and Nevada , [ losing the nomination ] has never happened before , and as you know there is a momentum , a forward progress —    BILL KRISTOL : Right , so we have to stop the momentum , I totally agree . JOE SCARBOROUGH : So that ’s my question . There ’s no cheering here . I am looking at facts . BILL KRISTOL : To your credit , you have correctly seen that this was not going to be the historically normal year , and this ’s not , so maybe we go —    SCARBOROUGH : So how do you beat   SCARBOROUGH ? BILL KRISTOL : You have to beat   SCARBOROUGH in Florida and Ohio , the first two     states , which means there has to be a de facto agreement between the opposition candidates   —    between the resistance to Trump , which I am proud to be a part of , because I think   SCARBOROUGH ’d be a terrible nominee and a terrible president   …        SCARBOROUGH : You have the authority to broker that deal right now ? BILL KRISTOL : Well , they need to . they need to defer to Rubio in Florida and probably to Kasich in Ohio , and say , or imply , that if you are a Cruz voter in Ohio , and if you look up the day before the primary and the primary ’s Trump 42 % Kasich 35 %   —    vote for Kasich . And the truth is if Trump does n’t win Florida and Ohio , Trump remains very much of an open race .    …      Trump [ so far ] has 35 % of the popular vote and 47 % of the delegates . That ’s a lot better than having 24 % of the popular vote and 25 % of the the delegates granted .            JOHN HEILEMANN : Just to go a little further on this topic of what Bill ’s advocating : As you talk more and more to Republicans , who will say to you privately JOHN HEILEMANN sometimes publicly , that they would rather vote for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump , [ these are the ] people who are going to try to stop him   Bill    their attitude they : We know they would happen at a contested convention if we took they nomination away from a Donald Trump [ who has won through ] a plurality of delegates . What would happen is that we would likely alienate his supporters a Donald Trump [who has won through] a plurality of delegates we would likely lose the presidential election . But their position we would likely alienate his supporters and we would likely lose the presidential election that it would be better for us to lose the [ general ] election than to have Donald Trump tear the Party in half as the nominee . Now you can say that ’s suicidal , but that is the posture of people [ worried ] about the negative effects down ballot . KRISTOL : And [ Trump ] would still lose the election the [general] election should n’t win the election , the [general] election yeah , I agree . This is a good time to ask where this    mentality was when America needed it most to stop Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 .    Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC
