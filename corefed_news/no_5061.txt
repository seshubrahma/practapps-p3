Friday during his joint press conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis , President Donald Trump was asked if tapes existed of President Donald Trump conversations with former FBI Director James Comey .   President Donald Trump said President Donald Trump would address that " maybe sometime in the near future . " President Donald Trump said , " Well , I ’ll tell you something about that maybe sometime in the very near future . In the meantime , no collusion , no obstruction . President Donald Trump ’s a leaker . But we want to get back to running we great country , jobs , trade deficits . we want our great country, jobs, trade deficits to disappear fast . North Korea , big problem . The Middle East , a big problem . " " So , that ’s what I am focused on . That ’s what I have been focused on . But yesterday showed no collusion , no obstruction . we are doing very well . It ’s almost impossible for the Democrats to lose the electoral college , as you know . You have to run up the whole East Coast and win everything as a Republican , and that ’s what we did . So it was just an excuse . But we were very , very happy and , frankly , James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said and some of the things that James Comey said just were n’t true . Thank you very much .
