Slate magazine on Sunday published " If You Want to Live Here , You Need to Live by the Rules Here , " a    word exposition of the Muslim migrant rape case in Twin Falls , Idaho . Author Michelle Goldberg subtitles Author Michelle Goldberg piece : " A sexual assault case involving refugee children in Idaho . A microcosm of America in the age of Trump . " That tells you all you need to know : Author Michelle Goldberg and Slate are using the Muslim migrant rape case in Twin Falls, Idaho to demonize opposition to the Democrats’ suicidal policies regarding Muslim migrants . [ Goldberg Author Michelle Goldberg n’t care about the     rape victim in Twin Falls in the slightest degree . In fact , throughout her Author Michelle Goldberg piece and in texts with the victim ’s mother , she mother this little girl and her mother on trial .   Goldberg Author Michelle Goldberg is further exposed by the fact that throughout her wordy mother , she does mother deign to include a full description of the attack itself . The closest Golberg comes to this is her account The closest Golberg the victim ’s mother ’s brief description of the video that the attackers took while they were the attackers the girl : " Her fiancé the girl she said the girl told her it the girl Her fiancé sex as well as their daughter the attackers urinated on . " But Goldberg follows this with prosecuting attorney Grant Loebs waxing " indignant at all the misrepresentations still swirling around about the case . ‘ I ’m a lifelong conservative Republican , and the behavior of the    alternative press on this is atrocious . ’ " Loebs’ own dishonesty I have shown in a previous article . The full exchange between Goldberg and Goldberg victim ’s mother , whom Goldberg calls Goldberg Lori , " reveals how manipulative and deceitful Goldberg is Goldberg In text messages since shared with me , Goldberg appears Goldberg to make the rape charge out to be some kind of cynical    scheme , questioning Lori about "Lori GoFundMe page that was set up for the family   —    as if the family the family   their daughter was the family   by Muslim migrants only to make money . Goldberg presses Goldberg about "Lori    suspension of the GoFundMe page in the wake of false charges that the rape claim was a " hoax "   —    was Goldberg hoping Goldberg expose the whole thing as a " hoax " as well ? In reality , the family is desperately poor and have not yet been able to move out of their apartment , the family they have been the family right next door to the rape suspect . Without any resources or powerful allies , they are going any resources or powerful allies against the      machine in the media , law enforcement , refugee resettlement programs , and more . In her text exchange , Goldberg repeatedly Goldberg to manipulate Lori into reflecting Goldberg ’s Goldberg of view . She disputes Lori Lori account Lori happening , at one point asking , " Wait , I thought there was no rape ? " Lori has to remind Lori ( spelling as Lori original ) : " Forced oral sex is a rape mam . " Meanwhile , the victim ’s mother told me this : " This is what my daughter has told me : that they grabbed her at knifepoint and my daughter her into the laundry my daughter and told her that if she my daughter to leave my daughter they would kill her they The     my daughter took her clothes off . my daughter tells me he my daughter his private The    boy her The    boy and peed my daughter her mouth , and her mouth in her private his private and my daughter peed all over her . And she my daughter they recorded my daughter , too   my daughter      She also told the my daughter room CARES doctor that they had a knife as well , and they found on her neck they cut my daughter Then the day after , they claimed it was a they , when in fact it looked like a cut it " Lori ’s fiancée told my daughter what he saw on the video Lori’s fiancée " I watched the     boy push my daughter up against my daughter and pull her pants down and his my daughter down he then attempted her pants behind . She my daughter able to run my daughter and crouch in a corner shaking in fear while the boy danced around naked laughing the    boy . I stopped watching my daughter that . " How is it that Goldberg found these facts unremarkable , too insignificant to report ? Goldberg repeatedly asks Lori manipulative questions designed to depict Lori Goldberg having an    agenda : " I ’m Lori asking if you agree with those who want to make it a story about refugees , or if they ’re taking advantage of your family ’s tragedy . refugees " Are they not being charged because they ’re refugees , or refugees they are minors ? refugees " Did you worry about refugees people from the Middle East in your complex before , or only since this happened ? " Then in her article , Goldberg compares Cambodian refugees of the 1980s to what ’s happening now . But this is a whole other thing : no previous group of refugees or immigrants has had a holy book that sanctions the sexual enslavement of    women ( cf . Quran 4:3 , 4:24 , 23 :   33:50 , 70:30 ) . Goldberg does not , of course , discuss that . Goldberg , she writes : " At first glance , it might Goldberg like an odd idea to bring traumatized foreigners to a remote , conservative American farming town . " But do n’t worry : Michelle Goldberg will convince you otherwise . Goldberg quotes Zeze Goldberg whom she identifies as " the Goldberg of the CSI Refugee Center Goldberg a Congolese refugee himself , " saying : " The integration process happens faster than in big cities , " he said . " In small towns like this , everyone Goldberg everyone . People are approachable . " Yeah , and    with a political and media machine ready to come to the aid of the rapist . Further tilting the playing field , Goldberg writes : " Refugee advocates insist that the vast majority of Twin Falls citizens support the newcomers . " Who are these " advocates " ? Has there been a vote , a referendum ? Zeroing in on her agenda , Goldberg also says : " This mounting demonization of refugees in Goldberg Falls has coincided , of course , with the rise Twin Falls Trump . " Of course , blame Trump . The fact is , this is not a     the Donald Trump or the egg thing .    and    sentiment led to the rise of Trump , not the other    around . But Goldberg relentlessly pushes Donald Trump agenda , looking for witnesses who call Goldberg of the Goldberg group ACT " pure racists . " It ’s plain slander . Who is really looking to exploit the story here ? Goldberg is intent on demonizing even the victim ’s mother . Goldberg quotes her as saying , " Maybe it ’s what Goldberg do Goldberg their country , I do n’t know . But I do know they the kids in that country can and are used as sex slaves . " Goldberg their country quote out of context , luring Lori into Goldberg this way by asking her why the boy Goldberg videotaped the rape showed the video Goldberg her fiancée . Goldberg does n’t quote another statement Lori texted Goldberg her : Goldberg I do believe there are Goldberg refugees that Goldberg here to live to get away from the horrible places they ’re at . " Goldberg ca n’t show Lori saying there are good refugees it Goldberg n’t fit her Goldberg . How low can Slate go ? To pursue Goldberg    agenda , Michelle Goldberg is demonizing and vilifying the family of it     Goldberg . Also , Goldberg tries to paint " Lori " as some kind of a Goldberg . While leaving out Goldberg that would make her sympathetic , Goldberg makes sure to include Lori ’s saying she Goldberg not been Goldberg , as if to imply that "Lori" is unbalanced "Lori" and her story false . The media is going to "Lori" lengths to kill this "Lori" , going so far as to target the family for character assassination her story can not allow them to do so . The leftist migrant agenda be damned : this poor little the family must have justice .
