From Steven Shepard writing at Politico :   A raft of new polls out this week carried almost unanimously good news for Hillary Clinton , staking the Democratic presidential nominee to significant leads over Donald Trump . But there ’s one potential warning sign in these polls should the race narrow : Hillary Clinton ’s lead over Donald Trump shrinks when voters are allowed to choose one of the major    candidates in the race . Yet the Libertarian Party ’s presidential ticket   —    composed of former GOP Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico and former GOP GOP Bill Weld of Massachusetts   —    appears to draw more from voters who might otherwise be aligned with Clinton , especially younger voters . The same is true of Green Party nominee Jill Stein   —    though to a lesser degree , since Stein Green Party nominee Jill Stein   n’t earn nearly the same level of support as Johnson . Here ’s why Democrats should be concerned : As Trump ’s support has dwindled in recent days   —    leaving the GOP nominee with just his the GOP nominee supporters   —    some soft voters might be moving into Clinton ’s camp when asked on a    ballot , but defecting to a third candidate when given other options .
