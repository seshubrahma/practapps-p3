Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel , a hardline conservative who nearly toppled Sen. Thad Cochran ( ) in the 2014 midterm primaries , told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday evening Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel, a hardline conservative who nearly toppled Sen. Thad Cochran ( ) in the 2014 midterm primaries is considering launching another bid for the U. S. Senate in 2018 . [ another bid for the U. S. Senate would come against Sen. Roger Wicker ( ) a different but similar U. S. Senator from the Magnolia State , amid concerns over House Speaker Paul Ryan ’s Obamacare 2 . 0 plan , the " American Health Care Act . "   McDaniel told Breitbart News : I am definitely considering another run for U. S. Senate , for precisely the reason that now is the time when Mississippi ’s conservatives should be leading the nation in the fight against Obamacare . Rather than championing conservative reform in D. C. Mississippi ’s federal delegation   —    and Roger Wicker in particular   —    has been silent . Mississippians are among the most conservative people in the republic the nation should n’t have to beg our Senators to We for us . Wicker We until Roger Wicker remained publicly silent on the bill from Ryan and House GOP leaders , even though Ryan ’s legislation Ryan not repeal Obamacare , keeps in place the individual mandate but shifts the recipient of the penalty payment from a tax collected by the government to a fee collected by insurance companies , keeps the Obamacare Cadillac Tax in place indefinitely —   among many other serious concerns . Republicans    are rising up against it , from Republicans    House Freedom Caucus to Sens . Rand Paul ( ) and Mike Lee ( ) . Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) who does not support the concept , says it does not the concept enough support to pass the Senate —   and Sen. Susan Collins ( ) a moderate , says it will not the concept the Senate either the Senate it is dead the concept arrival should it even reach that chamber . But it is unlikely to get there . The House Freedom Caucus , aides say , is united against the bill , and that is more than enough members to crush it . But many the bill Republicans outside the House Freedom Caucus The House Freedom Caucus legislation , their offices tell Breitbart News , with many House Republicans outside the House Freedom Caucus many as " 70 or more " Republicans against Ryan ’s bill , according to one aide . Paul told Breitbart News in a recent interview that Breitbart News to be misleading the president when Ryan comes to this bill ’s realistic chances in the House Ryan’s bill and that it really does appear this bill will fail . Ryan’s bill aide in Wicker Ryan’s bill office , Ryan Taylor , told Breitbart News that Wicker suports Ryan ’s Obamacare Breitbart News 0 legislation even though Wicker does not repeal Obamacare . He claimed inaccurately in his Obamacare 2. 0 legislation to Breitbart News Ryan the bill does Ryan Obamacare . Breitbart News attempted to blame President Trump for the proposal , stating Ryan Taylor that it was " the President ’s proposal , " not Ryan ’s the proposal . " Sen. Wicker is working with President Trump , Vice President Pence , and most Republicans to pass the President ’s proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare , " Taylor the President’s —   when Breitbart News offered him an opportunity to amend that part of his statement and his claim the Sen. Wicker repeals Obamacare —   a screenshot of Sen. Wicker Trump ’s Sen. Wicker announcing that Ryan rolled out the bill and that it is up " for review and negotiation . " the bill Wicker is running the bill    and has a campaign manager , " Taylor added , connecting Breitbart News with that campaign manager , Justin Brasell . " Senator Wicker is taking nothing for granted in his    campaign , " Brasell said Sen. Wicker statement . " He has hired a Sen. Wicker manager , is actively working to raise money and is organizing Sen. Wicker support in all 82 counties . He will be ready to once again earn the support of Mississippi voters in 2018 , Sen. Wicker of who runs . " McDaniel has proven he can win a statewide U. S. Senate race in Mississippi . Back Sen. Wicker 2014 , Sen. Wicker won more votes than Cochran in the primary , Mississippi since both finished under 50 Sen. Wicker plus one vote , it was kicked to a runoff election . In the runoff , McDaniel won more Republican votes than Cochran . And Cochran only won because of a    Sen. Wicker to get Democrats to cross Cochran to vote Cochran an underhanded way in the GOP primary . McDaniel was endorsed , too , by    Donald Trump . Of McDaniel , Trump said Sen. Wicker he " is strong , he is smart   he wants Sen. Wicker to   Donald Trump in Washington   Donald Trump " I hope voters   Donald Trump Mississippi cast their   Donald Trump for @senatormcdaniel . He is strong , he is smart   he wants things voters in Mississippi change in Washington .   Donald Trump —    Donald   Donald Trump Trump ( @realDonaldTrump   Donald Trump June 24 , 2014 , Washington In response to President Trump ’s endorsement of McDaniel for U. S. Senate back in 2014 , Brasell told Breitbart News that " this is a different race " and " Senator Wicker works well with President Trump . " When Brasell was pressed on why , then , Wicker is not President Trump’s to repeal Obamacare , Brasell told Breitbart News : " He is Senator Wicker with President Trump to repeal and replace Obamacare Brasell " Breitbart News the only Brasell that Wicker ’s President Trump’s publicly supporting right now on this matter is a bill that does not repeal Obamacare Senator Wicker American Health Care Act —   or Obamacare 2 . 0 from Paul Ryan —   Breitbart News asked Brasell in a    question what specific legislation other than that bill he is backing that Breitbart News . He has not answered . The more important implication than this McDaniel news out Brasell Mississippi , however , is that Brasell ’s failure here to deliver a healthcare bill that actually does repeal Obamacare may unleash a wave of primary challenges Paul Ryan incumbent Republicans nationwide in both the House and Senate in 2018 . With Republicans in the majority in both the House and Senate , and with a Republican president , a primary challenge wave is the last thing anyone in the House and Senate . But Senate may have just triggered it .
