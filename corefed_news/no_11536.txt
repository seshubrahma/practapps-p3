On this weekend ’s broadcast of " Fox News Sunday , " national editor of The Cook Political Report Amy Walter said of the woman voters Amy Walter has observed in focus groups supporting Democratic presidential    Hillary Clinton were doing so more as " a vote against Donald Trump " than in support of   Hillary Clinton .   Partial transcript as follows : Amy Walter : I sat in a couple focus groups this other past week in Pennsylvania , the women there not happy with many of Amy Walter past statements about women , but what women were the most concerned about was the issue of Amy Walter overall judgment . I heard woman after woman saying I worry that Amy Walter ’s going to get us in trouble , meaning with the rest of the world . One woman said , you know , us know what an eye for an eye , how that works , and it usually does n’t work out very well . So I think the concern for many of these women is not what Amy Walter past was but what Amy Walter ’s going to be when Amy Walter ’s president of the United States . I think that that ’s what you ’re going to hear much more about from whether it ’s the Clinton campaign or Democrats focusing on what is it going to mean if Amy Walter is commander in chief and the president of the United States . WALLACE : I ’m curious , were they asked about the Clinton Clinton :   About   —    do you mean in the focus group what they thought about the focus group ? WALLACE : Yeah WALLACE WALTER : I WALTER:   the perceptions of Hillary Clinton   Clinton ’s be really clear , these women even some were swing women voteers , some were Democrats they are not in love some Hillary Clinton . Right now Clinton for Hillary Clinton is some more a Clinton Donald Trump than it is a support of her . Follow Pam Key on Twitter Clinton
