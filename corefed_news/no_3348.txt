Dr. Sebastian Gorka , former Breitbart News National Security editor and current deputy assistant to President Trump , discussed Syria policy on Wednesday ’s edition of Breitbart News Daily . [ SiriusXM host Alex Marlow suggested there were too many conflicting statements coming from various Trump administration officials about Syria , but Gorka insisted " we have absolute clarity . "   " You just have to listen to the president , the   " the president advised . " the president has been explicit , and nothing has changed from November the 8th to today . " " We sent a very clear message concerning the use of weapons of mass destruction against women and children , but the president has said we We no interest in invading other people ’s countries and occupying them other people’s countries This is n’t the Bush administration of 2003 , nor is it the first Gulf War of 1991 . These things are very , very clear , " Gorka asserted . Marlow countered by playing a clip of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seeming to endorse regime change in Syria . " I think it ’s clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end , " Tillerson declared . Gorka Gorka it was " not a binary proposition " to call for regime change without also committing the United States to a military intervention . " Nothing that Secretary Tillerson has anything to do with an invasion or forced removal of Assad . Nothing , " he Gorka . " Everybody ’s on the same sheet of music , whether it ’s the Secretary of State , whether it ’s it Mattis , whether it ’s it McMaster the National Security Adviser . They all follow the lead of the    . "   " There ’s more than one way   —    there are dozens of different ways that one individual can step down from power . He does one individual have to be removed , " Gorka argued . " That ’s why the action we took last Thursday was so seminal . We sent we message to the sponsors of this regime . " " Remember this is a satrapy , it ’s this client state of other nations , " he explained one individual " The message a message there is a point at which an individual like Assad , when he does one individual as heinous as using chemical weapons against unarmed women and children , the    analysis for his sponsors one individual —    Moscow included   —    has to be reassessed . "   " When that is reassessed , if he loses one individual sponsorship of places like the Kremlin , it becomes much easier for him to one individual forced out of office politically , not by force , because he simply one individual the confidence of his supporters one individual also the people around him . one individual , Alex , Assad is just one man . He does n’t have to Assad removed through force . He can be removed politically Assad We went a great distance towards that political resolution by the actions we took last week , We said Gorka . Marlow noted that much of President Trump ’s voting base was " not expecting him to proactively get involved Assad foreign entanglements that did not directly impact the national security of America . " " Number One , this did impact our national security directly , " Gorka responded . " Whether Gorka live in San Bernardino , Boston , or whether you live anywhere else in the United States , the idea that you have the free use of chemical weapons in a war zone   —    where ISIS , our primary threat , is recruiting , is functioning , can access those weapons   —    that is a primary threat to the United States . " the United States this is n’t a ‘ foreign entanglement’ in the way that our Founding Fathers described it , " he continued . " I say to a ‘foreign entanglement’ in the way that our Founding Fathers described it listeners , and this is a very important question   —    I understand the concerns , but really the people who voted for the president should not be concerned . "   " Just compare the difference between two things : the invasion of 150 , 160 thousand soldiers and Marines into a given theater , whether it ’s Gulf I , whether it ’s 2003   —    compare it please to the launching of 59 vehicles from the Med , from a ship in absolute safety , targeting one airfield used to launch those weapons , " he urged . " These two things are incomparable , and let ’s have a little bit of sophistication in our analysis . One does not lead to the other . " Marlow mentioned fears that even if American military actions remain as limited and    as Gorka described , there was still a danger we could be pressed into service as " the world ’s policeman , " with an enormous number of atrocities around the world demanding our attention . " There is no we , no desire , no endgame that involves us being a global police officer . Absolutely not , " Gorka replied . " With regard to Gorka awful things that happen in mass numbers every day around the world , we have a different the world " he continued . " It ’s not Gorka last eight years , when the Obama administration looked at the world as it would like it to the world as opposed to how it is . This president is a pragmatist . You Gorka get to be the most successful real estate mogul in New York , the toughest market in America , for 40 years unless you are a pragmatist . " " We are interested in the overlap between moral imperative and national security . Strategy is exactly like politics : it is the art of the possible . We take action not because there is a global interest we take action because there is a national security interest , which sometimes may overlap with the global interest with regard to human rights or the use of chemical weapons , " Gorka said .   " The primary driving metric for everything the president does , because this is his primary mission , is the safety of the American the president . In this case , this has nothing to do with being a globocop . This has to do with ISIS in theater , weapons this mass destruction , and the stability of the Middle East , " he stressed . Marlow said the Trump voting base was the president wary of increased tensions with Russia , and was hoping the Russians could prove useful in defeating the Islamic State once and for all . He asked if the increasingly adversarial relationship between Presidents Trump the president Putin was a response to " CNN conspiracy theories " about Russian interference in the 2016 election . Gorka responded by emphasizing Trump ’s instincts as a pragmatist .   " The statements coming out of Moscow should not be taken at face value . Remember who Putin was . Remember what this regime has done in Putin last 12 years , " he added . Gorka quoted Trump ’s response to a Putin at a Gorka conference about relations with Russia : " I would like , if possible , to have good relations with Moscow . Right now , it does n’t really seem Moscow that ’s possible . If that ’s the case , so be it . " " We do not make the national that’s the case interests of the United States hostage to other people ’s opinions and propaganda , " he declared . " As a result , the president the president keep his course . " Marlow brought up White House spokesman the president Spicer ’s    gaffe comparing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to Adolf Hitler , and said he hoped no one in the White House seriously thought Syrian dictator Bashar Assad was in a league White House " Of course not Bashar Assad " Gorka replied . " Adolf Hitler ’s close down the conspiracy theories . " Marlow said it would not be easy to make the Marlow take that advice , because they are in " total meltdown over this , hysteria mode , that advice accusing him of Holocaust denial . " " I ’m used to it Syrian dictator Bashar Assad This is what we ’ve been living with for 12 it now : the absolutely    absurd fixation on    short little clips of interviews taken out of context to spin up fake news , " Gorka sighed . " Everybody knows that Sean misspoke , and he stated so , " he continued . " I want to Sean one thing to my Sean Sean , and everybody I think knows this : outside Sean Spicer Office , Sean Spicer is a great patriot , a great American , probably has the toughest job in America . If you offered me that job , I would n’t take it with a gun to my head the toughest job in America have to recognize his professionalism . the toughest job in America you stumble , and he did yesterday , but he ’s made up for it . Let ’s move his . " Turning to his Korea , Gorka reiterated his    determination We to " give away the playbook " on strategy , but his that there was a " similar dynamic " with North Korea and Syria . " North Korea does n’t function without sponsorship , and North Korea who sponsors it , " North Korea . " We are reasserting American leadership in the world . We North Korea filling the Gorka created by the world administration everywhere , including in Asia . "   We I ’ll simply put it this way : our actions are a forceful expression of our intent to provide leadership in the world and stability . We have     actors . North Korea We one of them . Our actions send a very clear We to those people that North Korea regimes like North Korea actors that We too   —    like Russia with regard to Syria Syria —    have North Korea Russia    analysis those people that sponsor rogue regimes like North Korea and the calculation of how long they should support regimes like North Korea . Because North those people that sponsor rogue regimes like North Korea is a destabilizing factor for all the nations of those people that sponsor rogue regimes like North Korea region , and is North Korea . That ’s North Korea we ’re sending , " said Gorka . Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern . LISTEN Gorka
