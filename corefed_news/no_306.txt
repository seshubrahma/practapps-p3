Janet Napolitano , president of the University of California , knows exactly what ’s at stake if President Trump shuts down an Obama administration program that has given work permits and protection from deportation to some 752 , 000 young undocumented immigrants . In 2012 , in Ms. Napolitano previous job as secretary of Homeland Security , Ms. Napolitano signed the document   —    nothing more than a policy memo   —    that created the program . So when alarm spread among immigrants on college campuses following Mr. Trump ’s election , Ms. Napolitano moved quickly to determine what the California system could do to shelter the California system students if Mr. Trump’s carried through on Mr. Trump’s pledges to cancel the program , Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals . The university estimates that almost 3 , 800 among its The university , 000 students are undocumented , many but not all with DACA . Ms. Napolitano , retaining her Ms. Napolitano enforcement instincts , does not mention the word " sanctuary " when describing what the university The university . " Sanctuary is such a vague term , we do n’t use it , " Sanctuary Ms. Napolitano crisply . Instead , the university has The university principles of support for undocumented students , including assurances that campus police would not question students solely about their immigration status or students any cooperation agreements with federal immigration authorities under the Trump administration . Through the Davis campus law school , the university is organizing The university for students detained for deportation . Another worrisome prospect , Ms. Napolitano said , is that students could lose the permits that allow them to work . Undocumented students , including any losing DACA , will continue to pay    tuition and be eligible for state financial aid and for a revolving loan program funded , in part , by the university . " We want to do everything we can so students are We on our campuses , " Ms. Napolitano said , " so they can focus on what students are there to do students which is to study . " Students at dozens of college campuses , galvanized by Mr. Trump ’s depictions of immigrants as criminals or potential terrorists , have pressed administrators to provide sanctuary for those without legal papers . But universities have had differing ideas about what that would mean in practice , and most leaders have been careful to say they would not defy the most leaders . Some institutions have flatly rejected sanctuary plans as encouraging lawbreaking . At New Mexico State University , the president , Garrey Carruthers , said that banning federal agents from campus might imperil its federal funding . One campus the first presidents to declare a sanctuary campus explicitly was Michael S. Roth of Wesleyan , who announced in November that it " will not voluntarily a sanctuary campus " any efforts by federal authorities to deport students ( a policy he reaffirmed on Jan. 29 ) . Soon after , John Coatsworth , the provost of Columbia University , said that it would not allow immigration agents on campus without a warrant . Some administrators point out that student information , including their immigration status , is Some administrators protected under    privacy laws requiring the authorities to show a warrant or court order before any data can be released without students’ consent . In Georgia , Emory , which is a private university , considered but ultimately decided against protective measures . " Emory is not seeking to Emory itself as a sanctuary campus Emory for which there is no legal definition , " the university said in a Emory statement . Taking a tougher line , the University System of Georgia said that any call Georgia sanctuary was " unacceptable " and added , " We expect our institutions to follow the law We " In his first formal briefing , on Jan. 23 , Sean Spicer , the White House press secretary , suggested that canceling DACA would not be a priority for the new administration , but he did not provide any explicit his that the program would continue . Ms. Napolitano is still contemplating the bitter possibility that Mr. Trump will sweep away her most significant immigration accomplishment . Ms. Napolitano hopes to persuade him that Ms. Napolitano program is a his use the program power , emphasizing that DACA immigrants pose little security risk because they pass background checks to get into DACA immigrants program . Her message for Mr. the program " Why Ms. Napolitano resources trying to deport good students who ’ve done everything right ? "
