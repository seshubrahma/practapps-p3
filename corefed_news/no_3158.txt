President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed deep changes to federal taxes , including sharp cuts in both individual and business taxes and the elimination of the estate tax . [ The proposal reduces the number of individual income tax brackets to three —   10 percent , 25 percent , and 35 percent .

The proposal also calls for the elimination of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax . The White House also said that families would receive a break for child care expenses .   As a result of these changes , the tax burden on most Americans would be reduced under the plan . The Trump administration would eliminate most itemized tax deductions except for the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations . Notably , taxpayers would not be able to deduct state and local taxes , which hurts residents of    states such as New York and California . Lower tax rates , however , make these deductions the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations . The corporate tax rate would fall to 15 percent from 35 percent . In addition , U. S. companies would owe little or no tax on future profits earned outside the U. S. putting the U. S. on a territorial tax system similar to those employed in most developed countries . Business income reported on individual returns would also drop to 15 percent , a change that would benefit many small businesses . Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economics adviser Gary Cohn set forth the framework at a White House press White House Wednesday .
