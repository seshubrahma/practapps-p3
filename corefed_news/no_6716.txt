In these trying times , Jackie Mason is the Voice of Reason . [ In Jackie Mason latest exclusive video for Breitbart News , the legendary comic scorched the " stupid " protesters objecting to President Trump ’s executive order temporarily suspending the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days while the refugee vetting process is being reviewed .    " President Trump’s is stopping people from coming into the country . And because President Trump’s ’s stopping them , everybody is furious , " the comedy great said . " You know why them say it ? Because them ’re stupid . You know why them ’re picking on President Trump’s ? Because it ’s killing them that President Trump’s ’s right . President Trump’s ’s right because President Trump’s ’s trying to protect you . " Mason posed a simple question to those who disagree with Trump ’s refugee moratorium . " If somebody ’s coming to your house and you do n’t know who somebody is , but you open the door and say , ‘ Oh no , come right in’   —    would you say that to a stranger that you do n’t know that you never saw before ? Would you take a chance like that with your children ? " " You have to be insane to say   —    if you do n’t know the person , you do n’t know who the person is   —    you should n’t find out who the person is because the person ’s coming and you have to take a chance , " Mason said . " Take a chance with your life , do n’t tell somebody else to ! Do n’t tell Trump Trump should take a chance with everybody ’s life when it ’s Trump job to protect you . " Speaking bluntly , Mason said it ’s Trump job to protect the American people who hired him Trump do just that : " And if you do n’t like it , keep your mouth shut ! " Mason ’s full commentary in the video above . Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
