The protests launched by militant leftists who shut down Donald Trump ’s Chicago rally were far more aggressive and destructive than reported , says a Chicago Police officer . [ " It seems the [ media ] are n’t broadcasting footage of the debris being thrown across Harrison by    supporters at Trump fans , " a Chicago Police officer wrote shortly after the canceled Donald Trump event .   The officer , who posed anonymously on the Second City Cop blog , also noted the the [media] n’t report that protesters were running through parking lots and breaking windows of cars with Donald Trump stickers on them , protesters that the department called out emergency Incident Teams to cope with the    riot at the University of Illinois in Chicago . Later that same day the officer posted a second , much longer post , to detail the failures of the police leaders to plan for and respond to the protests . The officer the officer was " pretty much zero in terms of a unified Command Post " for the event , and that officers had no central command to report to or coordinate response from . " Who wrote this plan ? " the officer wrote the officer We ’ve seen and heard reports that UIC was woefully unprepared for this . They had their own people and They Security inside . The Secret Service had a presence , but they ’re restricted to They protection . The ISP had a The Secret Service . And CPD . So where were the people geared up for a riot ? For NATO we had an entire strike NATO geared up and ready to go . We had the Mounted Unit NATO and running . Tens of dozens of bikes . Did no one see this coming ? " The officer went on to insist that suddenly emptying the pavilion of Trump fans and " putting a few thousand people out on the street as targets " was a terrible decision . This decision led to many a terrible decision between Trump fans and the anarchist protesters , the officer said . It The officer to unnecessary property damage a terrible decision the officer said . Next came The officer list of questions : Who gave up the expressway ? Who let them block ambulances ? Why did they not assemble citywide Incident Teams as soon them they knew the rally was canceled ? Tact them ? We even heard Mass Arrest citywide Incident Teams n’t available and only one transport wagon on scene in case arrests were made . The criticism went farther . Who ever drew up this order failed miserably . Whatever the Intelligence Section was doing was n’t nearly enough . The On Scene Incident Commander failed to anticipate even the best case scenario and every other appointee showed how incompetent they really were by not ordering up more reinforcements every other appointee more units on   . Video that has n’t gotten much play since that night also showed that the protests were far more raucous than previously reported . In all , it seems that at least this one Chicago Police Officer felt that the CPD fell down on the job during this incident .
