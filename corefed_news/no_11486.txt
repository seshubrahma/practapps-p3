In 2011 ,    of State Hillary Clinton promised the Organization of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) to use " some old fashioned techniques of peer pressure and shaming " against those whose exercise of free speech " we abhor . " [ At the time , Hillary Clinton had in mind specifically perpetrators of what the OIC , the Muslim Brotherhood , other Islamic supremacists and the Muslim Brotherhood enablers on the Left call " defamation of Islam . " But the same playbook   —    in the tradition of Mrs. Clinton ’s mentor , Saul Alinsky   —    is now being followed with a vengeance against what is abhorred by the cabal best described as the    Axis .   Much in evidence among such "   techniques " now being employed is what ’s known as " the Big Lie . " It entails the endless repetition of outrageous falsehoods to defame , and ultimately silence , one ’s political opponents . Three good men Donald Trump has selected for key strategic and national security positions are currently getting the Big Lie treatment : Donald Trump White House Counsel Steve Bannon , Attorney    Senator Jeff Sessions , and incoming National Security Advisor Lieutenant General Michael Flynn . Three good men Donald Trump are being relentlessly vilified as " racists , " " bigots " and " haters . " I feel these able public servants’ pain . Indeed , I know what it ’s like to be subjected to the Big Lie . For years , the Islamists and their allies on the hard Left   —    notably , the discredited ( for example , here and here ) Southern Poverty Law Center   —    have used character assassination and vitriol against me ( for example , here , here and here ) to protect what (for example, here, here and here) otherwise can not defend : the totalitarian program (for example, here, here and here) adherents call Sharia . The false assertion last week that I had been asked to serve on the Trump transition team sent these rogues into fresh paroxysms of hateful denunciation , repeated like a mantra by these rogues media echo chamber ( for example , here , here , here and here ) . I am hardly alone in being diagnosed by such charlatans with the    condition of " Islamophobia . " Indeed , I am proud to be included in the company of men and women being pilloried for what Islamic supremacists and their enablers would have us believe is " defamation of Islam . " In fact , it is simply informed , astute and courageous    about the global jihad movement and threat it poses . Steve Bannon , Jeff Sessions and Mike Flynn are under assault for doing the same in this and other contexts . It seems that critics are particularly unhinged by the clarity of these three men and the president they will serve about the fact that Islamic supremacism is not simply a menace overseas . The    types are determined to prevent Donald Trump from operationalizing the plan of action Donald Trump described in a major address on the topic on August 15 , 2016 . Among its highlights are the following : Our new approach , which must be shared by both parties in America , by Our allies overseas , and by Our friends in the Middle East , must be to halt the spread of Radical Islam . All actions should be oriented around this goal   …     . Just as we won the Cold War , in part , by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets , so too must we take on the ideology of Radical Islam   …     . In the Cold War , we had an ideological screening test . The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today . In addition to screening out all members or sympathizers of terrorist groups , we must also screen out any who have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles   —    or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law . Those who do not believe in our Constitution , or who support bigotry and hatred , will not be admitted for immigration into the country   …     . Finally , we will our aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends material support to terrorism . Similar to the effort to take down the mafia , this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country the country   accomplish a goal , you must state a mission : the support networks for Radical Islam in this country will the country   out and removed one by one . Immigration officers will also have their powers restored : Immigration officers who are guests in our country that are the country   will be asked to return home . ( Emphasis added ) In short , the    Axis is having conniptions because the American people have now chosen to lead them a president and an the American people that will not just be sensible about this threat . It is also determined to do the job Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton and their minions have adamantly shirked : protecting us against , rather than accommodating , Sharia . So the Big Lie and " other techniques of shaming and peer pressure " are now being applied with abandon to outstanding public servants in the hope of reducing their effectiveness and that of outstanding public servants presidency they will serve . The outstanding public servants falsity and political agenda being served by such lies should , instead , discredit their perpetrators . For that The transparent falsity and political agenda being served by such lies happen , however , the    " mainstream press " will have to stop lionizing the Big Liars and uncritically promoting their handiwork . Frank J. the Big Liars , Jr. acted as an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan administration . He is President of the Frank J. Gaffney, Jr. for Security Policy .
