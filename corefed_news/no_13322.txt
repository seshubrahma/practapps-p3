After the massive    that was the poorly thought out ,    executed and    " Against Trump " diatribe last week , " National Review " is apparently still so bitter that on Monday morning another fatal decision was made   —    to attack everyday Americans as stupid homophobes . With conservatives like these , who needs leftists , or the mainstream media ? The National Review Online ( NRO ) lead piece was written by Thurston Howell III Kevin Williamson , titled " Our    Politics " ( the title changed later in the day ) and puts forth the theory that Donald Trump is winning because the everyday Americans who support the billionaire businessman do not or can not read . [ T]he candidacy of Donald Trump is something that could not happen in a nation that could read . This is the full flower of    politics . Trump supporters are also bigots : Thomas Aquinas cautioned against " homo unius libri , " a warning that would not get very far with the typical Trump voter stuck sniggering over " homo . " ( They Trump supporters snigger over " snigger , " too , for similar reasons . ) The word " insalubrious " is then used , which I had to look up : Donald Trump is the face of that insalubrious relationship , a lifelong crony capitalist who brags about buying political favors . But his Donald Trump , devoid as they are of a literate politics capable of thinking about all three sides of a triangle at the same time[. ] You have to read the whole thing to believe it the whole thing Had this published     at Salon , no one would blink an eye . In other words , anyone who believed NRO would be circumspect in the face of last week ’s backlash was sorely mistaken . NRO NRO become the very caricature it paints NRO Trump . All the    publication has is insults as opposed to ideas   —    as though pomposity itself is argument enough . Do n’t you understand , if the rubes could quote Thomas Aquinas like us snobs , the rubes the rubes what is best for them ! Apparently the rubes could quote Thomas Aquinas like us snobs is unforgivable that the hoi polloi are simply too busy going about the business of keeping our world turning us have the time to read " Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire "   too busy fighting our wars , us our toilets , us our cars , us our food , us our heating oil us and working three    jobs . The Unwashed have , however , read enough to know that Democrats never do this   —    never attack their own voters Democrats never do this  —    NRO and the rest of the Establishment have this year . But maybe   —    just maybe   —    because they spend all Democrats never do this  —    time in Democrats never do this  —    Real World and not hiding inside NRO ’s erudite reading list , the Unwashed also intuitively understand that what NRO and the NRO have the Establishment for five presidential cycles is pure undiluted ,    bull shit . The Unwashed might not the Unwashed Shakespeare , but they can read a paycheck the Unwashed The Unwashed might not have the Unwashed Capitalism and Freedom , " but they have read a pink slip the Unwashed their job went overseas or to the Unwashed exploited illegal immigrant . The Unwashed might not have consumed the Unwashed library of Greek and Roman classics ( in the original or in translation ) but they have consumed years of " Dial the Unwashed for English , " Common Core math problems , terror attacks committed by immigrants , and an Establishment so removed Jeb Bush is being sold as a winner because    …      he   speaks Spanish . The Unwashed Jeb Bush not read a publication that still pines for a Real Conservative , no less than the architect of ObamaCare who has already lost a nationwide presidential election , but they can read a country slipping away The Unwashed a morass of political correctness , identity politics , and a Republican Party more concerned with the trough that comes with treating illegal immigrants better than America ’s working class . NRO simply ca n’t believe Americans are NRO enough to fall for a slogan like " Make America Great Again . " Maybe NRO America read more . NRO appears to have been caught off guard by an electorate that is n’t falling for The Establishment ’s snake oil this year . Maybe NRO should step out of the Velvet NRO now and again . The publication that once served up a cup that runneth over with ideas is   now reduced to lashing out with ad hominem   —    not against the Powerful ( like Trump ) but against the everyday Americans found in William F. Buckley ’s fabled phone book . Things really have changed at NRO . Impotent rage is a helluva NRO .    Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC                 My link says Buckley used the " Manhattan " phone William F. Buckley’s in his famous quote . Twitter is telling William F. Buckley’s it was " Boston . " The the "Manhattan" phone book in his famous quote has been edited to avoid an insalubrious battle .
