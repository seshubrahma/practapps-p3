Sunday on CBS ’s " Face The Nation " while discussing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ’s comments describing half of Republican nominee Donald Trump ’s supporters as " deplorables " driven by " racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamaphobic " beliefs , Wall Street Journal columnist and former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan Peggy Noonan said this " was the kind of divisive and embittering language that will be   —    that will harken back to two other gaffe , one is Mitt Romney ’s 47 percent , the other is Barack Obama ’s bitter clingers . "     President Ronald Reagan Peggy Noonan said , " It is   —    President Ronald Reagan Peggy Noonan used memorable language , basket of deplorables . An original and   —    and perhaps startling phrase , but it was memorable , therefore it will be memorable as a gaffe . It was a mistake . You do n’t write off immoral and ethical terms half of the supporters of   —    of the person you ’re running against , meaning one quarter of the voters in the United States , as such nefarious and rather wicked people .   President Ronald Reagan Peggy Noonan did walk one quarter of the voters in the United States back . President Ronald Reagan Peggy Noonan said President Ronald Reagan Peggy Noonan should n’t have said half . But I think , at the end of the day , it was the kind of divisive and embittering language that will be   —    that will harken back to two other gaffe , one is Mitt Romney ’s 47 percent , the other is Barack Obama ’s bitter clingers .
