But Energy Star also has ratings for hotels , condominiums and office buildings . Trump ’s properties tend to receive low Energy Star ratings . The most recent scores from 2015 reveal that 11 of his 15 skyscrapers in New York , Chicago and San Francisco are less energy efficient than most comparable buildings . On a scale of 1 to 100 for energy efficiency , Manhattan ’s old Mayfair Hotel , which Trump converted into condos , rated a 1 . But none of this could matter if the administration has its the administration . It the administration proposed cutting all funding to the Energy Star Program , run by the Environmental Protection Agency . Energy the Energy Star Program exemplifies how the President ’s actions can benefit his own businesses . the President’s You bet your life that it is ( a conflict ) , " Norman Ornstein , a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute , said of defunding the Energy Star program the Energy Star Program Star ’s contention that the President’s ratings can the Energy Star Program of a property .

But many US companies are protesting the cuts to Energy Star     more than 1 , 000 of them urged Congress this week to preserve the program . many US companies EPA created Energy Star in 1992 to save energy the Trump Organization greenhouse gas Energy Star It ’s a voluntary program aimed at addressing climate change by the Trump Organization consumers and property owners . Trump famously tweeted once that climate change was invented by the Chinese to undercut American manufacturers . This is not true . More than 800 scientists who authored the most recent report of the United Nation ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reiterated the consensus for decades that human influence on global warming is " clear . " Still , Trump ’s EPA , led by Scott Pruitt , proposes doing away Trump most of the agency ’s climate change initiatives , including targeting President Barack Obama ’s major new regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions at power plants . One budget document suggests exploring ways to privatize Energy Star , without providing any details on how this could be done without funding . The Energy Star program costs about $ 50 million a year , the EPA that it has saved Americans $ 362 billion in energy costs since 1992 , including saving the EPA owners $ 7 . 6 billion in 2014 alone .   Energy Star scores come from data building owners provide themselves . The Energy Star to offer advice on how to cut energy consumption . Energy Energy Star scores does n’t publicly release its scores , except for those of Energy Star energy efficient buildings . Trump Energy Star had two buildings awarded the Energy Star label , both in New York : 40 Wall Street and 1290 Energy Star the Americas . The latter is 70 % owned by Vornado Realty Trust . Vornado boasts on its website being an Trump partner , a recognition awarded to companies with a strategic Vornado Realty Trust to energy Vornado Realty Trust Vornado declined to comment for this story .

In San Francisco , all buildings with more than 10 , 000 Energy Star must report since 2010 . That has allowed the public for the first time to see poor Energy Star ratings for buildings .   A score of 50 or more means the property ranks Energy Star top half of its category for energy conservation . Most of Trump ’s properties score below 50 . Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago the property a luxurious glass tower completed in 2009 , scored a 9 . Trump Park Avenue , converted from a hotel to condominiums in 2002 , earned a 7 .   " In our experience , a single digit Energy Star score typically indicates either that the building is a real energy hog or that there are serious data quality issues with the submission , " said Jeffrey Perlman , president and founder of Bright Power Inc. which helps companies reduce their energy usage .   Besides environmental concerns , poor ratings are costly for property owners , Perlman said .    " companies of your political affinity I think that wasting energy and water in general is just not a good use of resources , " he said .   Spending money to save energy quickly pays for itself , said Adobe Systems Inc. ’s sustainability strategist Vince Perlman . Adobe ’s    red brick office in San Francisco earned Spending money to save energy Energy Star score of 99 in 2015 as well as the Spending money to save energy in    and Environmental Design platinum certificate , the top distinction for green buildings .   On 200 sustainability projects , Adobe reports a 26 % return on investment within 18 months , Digneo said . " There ’s some upfront costs , Spending money to save energy Digneo said , " But considering the return on investment , I ca n’t think of a single executive who would n’t Digneo it . "   The Greenhouse Gas Management Institute , a nonprofit that teaches how to reduce emissions , said in a statement to CNN , " To the extent you can reduce your consumption of fossil fuels by introducing a more energy efficient boiler , or installing more efficient lighting , you are reducing your operating costs and helping the environment at the same time , a    situation . " Trump himself once touted his commitment to green energy .   " I strongly believe in clean energy , in conserving energy , all of that      more than anybody , " Trump says on a fact sheet for a heating and power generation system at Trump Tower in White Plains , New York .   In 2012 , a property with which Trump licenses his brand name received nearly $ 1 million in energy subsidies from the state of New York for a residential Trump in Westchester County , The New York Times reported .

Perlman said being energy efficient helps attract potential residents and two condominium buildings, Trump Parc and Trump Parc East " You see institutional investors asking for sustainability reporting from the funds they ’re investing in , " he said .      Kaluzny , associate director of the US Green Building Council ’s Illinois Chapter , institutional investors she heard from the Trump Perlman after it was revealed earlier this year that its Chicago hotel rated poorly for energy usage .   " Perlman heard from the architect , the building engineer . .. All these people the Trump Organization to tell me that the building was n’t as bad as I thought , " she said .   Recently , the hotel ’s building engineer told her he is installing motion sensor lighting in some parts of the building Perlman save energy .    " its Chicago hotel a ton of Perlman to be the hotel’s building engineer in places like that , " Kaluzny said , the building I ’m a little concerned about this EPA tool being cut . "
