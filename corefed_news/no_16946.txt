  ( CNN ) From the rowdy Republican primaries right into the general election buzzsaw , the 2016 campaign has been an elephant graveyard for political convention .    The art of the debate night    seemed lost for long stretches of the contest . The vice presidential debate was a low point . Wrestling with their own rhetorical limits , Mike Pence and Tim Kaine ultimately found their pinned under a pile of cringeworthy gibes .     " You are Donald Trump ’s apprentice , " Tim Kaine told Mike Pence , to crickets .   Pence dove into the uncanny valley of zingers , appropriating one of Ronald Reagan ’s signature lines     " There you go again "     by responding to a Tim Kaine attack by saying , " There they go again . " Thud . The primaries had n’t been much kinder . The most memorable    delivered by Marco Rubio , was delivered and then delivered and delivered again . Four times in one brief exchange , Four times in one brief exchange told voters it was time to " dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama does n’t know what Barack Obama ’s doing . "   " Barack Obama knows exactly what Barack Obama ’s doing , " Marco Rubio said and said again , though it was clear that , at least in this endeavor , Barack Obama clearly did not . So what went wrong     or right ? Had blunt , bombastic , boisterous and brusque billionaire Donald Trump slain another sacred cow ? Was the era of the    over ? " I do n’t think so , " said former Mitt Romney campaign aide and CNN commentator Lanhee Chen , optimistic even after the vice presidential fiasco . " I think there is still a purpose for them because former Mitt Romney campaign aide and CNN commentator Lanhee Chen, optimistic even after the vice presidential fiasco normally makes a    good is that it encapsulates a really big point in a very memorable way . There is still going to be a demand for that kind of thing for candidates . " Social media , especially Twitter , can grab an effective       especially the kind with a quirky touch     and act as an accelerant , like it did when Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin would consider Trump his " Russian President Vladimir Putin " in the White House . When " Child ’s Play " creator Don Mancini posted an image of his " Don Mancini " minutes later , it was clear . Clinton had broken out and delivered a very serious message about Trump ’s alleged affinity for Moscow in a way that landed with the broader public . She struck Clinton minutes later , succeeding where her running Clinton did not , by tweaking Trump over Trump’s most Trump’s day job . " On the day when I was in the ( White House ) Situation Room monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice , " she said Clinton readying the hammer , " he was Osama bin Laden ’The Celebrity Apprentice.’ " And how about what Trump shot Trump’s ? Chances are , you do n’t remember . John Hudak , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , says the    analysis has never come out more heavily in favor of at least attempting to create what politicos call " a moment . " " There ’s a heavier reliance today on trying to land that    because candidates are looking for that tweet , that little bit of snark that can be conveyed in a very short , punchy way , " he said John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution " Because Twitter has become such a force in media and such a force in politics , too often now candidates are trying not just to land the zinger , but land the tweet . " As an example : " Imagine Twitter in 1988 , " Hudak said . " It would have gone crazy when Lloyd Bentsen said that ( see below ) . He won Lloyd Bentsen debate and he won Lloyd Bentsen that line . But he probably Lloyd Bentsen have won by a much bigger margin if he were Lloyd Bentsen it in an era of Twitter . " But as Bentsen and Lloyd Bentsen top of his losing Lloyd Bentsen ticket , Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis , can attest , simply " winning " a debate is not the same as gaining a meaningful toehold in a tough campaign . They lost to George H. W. Bush and Quayle in an electoral landslide . The full measure of Clinton ’s salvos ca n’t be taken in their immediate They , but in the days     and news cycles     to come . The question now is whether her pithy Clinton accomplished their fundamental her pithy attacks .   " If you effectively land it , you know it will it the TV coverage all day the next day and into the next week , "   said Lis Smith , the director of rapid response for President Barack Obama ’s 2012 campaign and a top aide to Martin O’Malley during his primary Martin O’Malley this year . " So if you effectively land a zinger , it is guaranteed that it will it the news coverage and there is a very real utility in that . " The rewards may be greater as ever , but the degree of difficulty in pulling off that successfully sharp , if telegraphed jab , grows as cultural consumers , already inundated with    brand messaging , gets more    to    stagecraft .   " The curtain has been pulled back on debate prep more than ever , " Smith said . " The public is more conscious about the artifice that goes into debates     the zingers and different debate tactics that candidates use . So because people are more aware of the artifice that goes into these things , they ’re people likely to roll their eyes people they hear people clearly scripted a   . " The eyeball test was kindest to Clinton in her third Clinton final debate with Trump . Her cringe Clinton allusion to , deep breath , "   trickle down " economics from their first round , on September 26 in New York , seemed so very far off .   " In tonight ’s debate , " Smith emailed late Wednesday , " Hillary Clinton Clinton zinger great again . "
