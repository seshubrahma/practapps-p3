More than once , Innate Immunotherapeutics has run out of money and nearly closed its Innate Immunotherapeutics . But despite its Innate Immunotherapeutics profile , Innate has some surprisingly influential boosters in Washington . The congressional liaison to    Donald J. Trump ’s transition team , Representative Chris Collins , Republican of New York , is the company ’s largest shareholder and sits on the board . Representative Tom Price of Georgia , Mr.   Donald J. Trump nominee to be secretary of health and human services , purchased shares of Innate four times in 2015 and 2016 , according to congressional financial disclosures , totaling between $ 60 , 000 and $ 110 , 000 .

Last summer , Mr. Price , Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon bought the stock at a discount as part of a private offering organized by Innate aimed at " sophisticated U. S. investors . " They have since Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon their money , Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon least on paper . Mr. Price ’s investments in health care companies , including Innate , are almost certain to be a focus of questioning during his confirmation hearings Mr. Price week . Some prominent Democrats are already asking whether he may have Mr. Price ethical lines by investing in companies that stood to benefit from legislation he helped shape Mr. Price Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Louise Slaughter of New York and other Democrats have called for investigations into Mr. Price ’s trades .

" But it ’s got to be taken a look at . It ’s just so suspicious , someone ’s got to ask , ‘ it just happened ? ’ " Mr. Collins and Mr. Price have both been active in shaping health care legislation , and Tom Price in favor of the 21st Century Cures Act , which was backed both the pharmaceutical industry and included measures that would allow the F. D. A. to approve drugs more quickly . Mr. Price is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee ’s subcommittee Tom Price , and Mr. Collins serves on the health panel of the Energy and Commerce Committee . A spokesman for Mr. Collins said the congressman had followed all ethical guidelines and said Mr. McAdams he Mr. Collins involved in . " He is very proud of the progress the company has Mr. Collins over the years and hopeful it Mr. Collins be able to develop a potentially lifesaving treatment for the millions of individuals suffering from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis , " said the spokesman , Michael McAdams . In an interview this week in San Francisco , Innate ’s chief executive , Simon Mr. McAdams all of the attention now being paid to what he described as his " little biotech at the wrong end of the world . " Mr. Mr. Collins and Michael Mr. Collins , Innate ’s chairman , said they had never heard of many of the company ’s more prominent investors , and said they first learned that Mr. Price had invested in the company from an article in The Wall Street Journal , which first reported his investment they They also said they had not heard of the company , the    shareholder , or Mr. Paxon and said they had little Mr. Price in they the ear they powerful Washington players . Their goal , they said , is to sell the company to they larger pharmaceutical company . " It wo n’t be up to us they seek approval they the drug , " Mr. Wilkinson said in the interview , which took place at his hotel on a rundown they in San Francisco , where he was pitching the company to potential buyers at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference . Mr. Wilkinson many biotech    Innate has had ups and downs , Mr. Wilkinson Wilkinson said the company But sometimes , things happen , " he added . In his case , he said , " I met Chris . Mr. Wilkinson Wilkinson said he was on a    trip to the United Mr. Wilkinson in 2005 when Mr. Wilkinson two met Mr. Wilkinson and he made his pitch to Mr. Collins Mr. Wilkinson was then Mr. Wilkinson businessman with a reputation for turning around struggling companies . Mr. Collins decided to invest in the Mr. Wilkinson , Mr. Wilkinson joining its board . In 2007 , Mr. Collins was elected county executive of Erie County , which includes Buffalo , and in 2012 , he won election to Congress the company He remained on Innate ’s Mr. Collins and Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Quinn said his new political career has had little impact . " Mr. Collins anything , I suspect it Mr. Collins probably a negative , " Mr. Quinn said . " Because he ’s Mr. Collins bit harder to access   —    he ’s just busy . " Mr. his new political career remained one of the company ’s Mr. Quinn , enlisting many of his Mr. Quinn as investors and even lending the company money a Mr. Quinn of times when it was at risk of going out of business .

A midlevel trial is underway , and results are due in the middle of this year . Experts in congressional ethics and trading rules said there did not appear to be evidence that Mr. Collins or Mr. Price used nonpublic information to steer their investment activities , a practice that would violate what is known as the Stock Act , which bans insider trading by members of Congress . But , said Donna M. Nagy , a Experts in congressional ethics and trading rules professor at Indiana University who has written on the financial investments by members of Congress , " One needs facts in order to get answers to those questions , and coming up with the facts for that is going to be difficult . " Mr. Holman of Public Congress said Mr. Collins ’s recruiting efforts among Washington power players created the opportunity for " influence peddling . " For example , Mr. Paxon , who represented Mr. Collins ’s congressional district in the 1990s , could appear before Mr. Collins as both a lobbyist and a fellow investor in Innate . " It ’s a very effective means of buying access and hopefully influencing politicians , " Mr. Holman said . Mr. Mr. Collins spokesman said Mr. Paxon and Mr. Collins had never discussed Innate and noted that , because they are both from the Buffalo area , he might have become aware of Innate through Mr. Collins the region . Mr. Paxon did not Mr. Collins emails and a call for comment .
