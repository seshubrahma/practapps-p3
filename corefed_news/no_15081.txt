  ( CNN ) The following contains spoilers about " Homeland ’s "    finale . " Homeland " might have got the gender of Homeland fictional president wrong , but as usual , the sixth season of the Showtime series     which concluded Sunday     also got plenty right in weaving    threads into Homeland storyline , while still delivering the taut attributes of a thriller . More than most shows in the genre , " Homeland " operates in gray areas , avoiding facile solutions or easy answers . Where most dramas preoccupied with terrorism gravitate toward the good and bad , this one often deals in murky choices between the lesser of two evils . That was abundantly true of the season finale , which saw the end of what amounted to a coup attempt against the    ( Elizabeth Marvel ) and a thwarted assassination plot . What followed , however , also validated concerns that she would overreach as president , flashing forward to the sweeping purge undertaken in response to those events . The payoff left the program ’s heroine , Carrie Mathison ( Claire Danes ) who ostensibly had the president ’s ear , at a professional and personal crossroads . With the series already renewed for two more seasons , the series also sets up several tantalizing prospects as the show presumably arcs toward the show finish . The finale ’s narrative twists capped a season dominated by a clandestine war between the incoming administration and the intelligence community . As a bonus , it also featured an elaborate " fake news " operation conducted with the latter ’s blessing , run by a bombastic talk personality clearly intended to resemble Infowars’ Alex Jones . Under Dar Adal ( F. Murray Abraham , in Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham most expansive work for the show to date ) the CIA fretted about the new Commander in Chief gutting the CIA operations . Those forces went so far as to frame a    youth with a provocative online footprint in a terrorist attack , in what might be a construed as a reaction to legitimate criticism of " Homeland ’s " past depictions of Muslims as terrorists . All that built toward Sunday ’s finale , in which the orchestrated attempt on the president ’s life resulted in the sacrifice of Carrie ’s longtime associate , Peter Quinn ( Rupert Friend ) in order to save Carrie . " Ultimately , I lost control of what I set in motion , " Dar Adal told CIA colleague Saul Berenson ( Mandy Patinkin ) a line that neatly described the frequent " Homeland " theme of unintended consequences . The producers have discussed that The producers were roughly halfway through writing the season when Donald Trump was elected president , suddenly casting The producers efforts into a different light . As executive producer Alex Gansa noted , " things have gotten even more contentious between Donald Trump and the intelligence community , which is what our whole season was about crazily enough . " Alas , not everything else about the sixth season worked equally well . Quinn ’s emotional fate came after an extended subplot dealing with the stroke Quinn suffered in staving off a terror threat , and while a sympathetic figure , that felt more like a distraction from the main themes than an addition to it . Quinn has always provided a window into Carrie ’s conflicted soul , but much of the drama surrounding them simply felt strained . That included Carrie potentially losing custody of Carrie child , a rather manipulative way to showcase the difficulty of    balance when the gig is in   . Those missteps , however , played like relatively minor flaws in a season that proved compulsively watchable     one that has set events in motion that should whet appetites for what ’s to come more than any recent " Homeland " edition .
