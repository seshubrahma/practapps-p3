The Middle East Forum ’s " Islamist Money in Politics " project compiles an annual list of politicians who receive campaign contributions from Islamist groups and " individuals who subscribe to the same Islamic supremacism as Khomeini , Bin Laden , and ISIS . " [ The    recipient in the    list is Hillary Clinton , who raked in $ 41 , 165 from prominent Islamists , says the report :   This includes $ 19 , 249 from senior officials of the Council on    Relations ( CAIR ) declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates on November 15 , 2014 . For example , Mrs. Clinton has accepted $ 3 , 900 from former CAIR    Ahmad    who has defended numerous Islamists in Ohio indicted   —    and later convicted   —    on terrorism charges . The top ten list includes nine Democrats , one independent ( who just happens to have been Mrs. Clinton ’s chief rival for the Democratic nomination , Bernie Sanders ) and zero Republicans . Donald Trump received no Islamist money , and neither did Libertarian Gary Johnson . Jill Stein of the Green Party accepted $ 250 in such donations . " While the amounts of Islamist donations are relatively small , the information : ( 1 ) holds politicians accountable for accepting funds from soiled sources ( 2 ) signals the Islamist lobby ’s affections and intentions and ( 3 ) tells voters who takes money from individuals linked to enemies of the United States and the United States allies , " the Middle East Forum argues . CAIR has been declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted    in a    operation .   CAIR is closely entwined with Islamists and with jihadis that court documents and news reports show that at least five of CAIR people   —    either board members , employees or former employees   —    have been jailed or repatriated for various financial and    offenses . Breitbart has also published evidence highlighted by critics showing that CAIR was named an unindicted    in a    criminal effort to deliver $ 12 million to the    HAMAS jihad group , that CAIR was founded with $ 490 , 000 from HAMAS , and that the FBI bans    meetings with CAIR officials . " The FBI policy restricting a formal relationship with CAIR remains    …      [ but ] does not preclude communication regarding investigative activity or allegations of civil rights violations , " said an Oct. 2015 email from the FBI spokesman Christopher Allen . In 2009 , a federal judge concluded that " the government has produced ample evidence to establish the associations of CAIR   …      with Hamas . " Awad has a long history of    statements , according to critics . CAIR   has posted CAIR   defense online .
