   FactCheck . org was forced on Thursday to make an embarrassing correction after org incorrectly attributed a quote from Peter ’s Schweizer ’s Clinton Cash that never appeared in the book . [ " Correction : June 23 : Our original story incorrectly stated that Peter’s Schweizer’s wrote in the book that Clinton had veto power over the sale , " admitted FactCheck . org .   The embarrassing " mistake " occurred in a    involving the    and confirmed Peter’s Schweizer’s revelation that Hillary Clinton ’s State Dept . approved the transfer of 20 percent of U. S. uranium to the Russian government , as nine investors in the deal funneled $ 145 million to Hillary Hillary Clinton’s . Originally , FactCheck . org claimed the following : In his book , " Clinton Cash , " which Trump referred to in his speech , his Peter Schweizer claimed that Clinton , as Hillary Clinton’s committee member , had ‘ veto power’ and ‘ could have stopped’ the sale . But that ’s not accurate . The committee can approve a sale , but it can not The committee a sale . There ’s just one problem : contrary to what FactCheck . org reported , the words " veto power " and " could have stopped " appear nowhere in the Clinton Cash book in relation to Hillary Clinton ’s State Dept . approving the transfer of American uranium to Putin ’s Russia . Hence , FactCheck . org FactCheck forced to issue the following embarrassing correction : Correction , June 23 : Our original story incorrectly stated that Schweizer wrote in his book that Schweizer had veto Hillary Clinton’s over the sale . Schweizer said that Schweizer a TV interview , not in his book . his book revised our story to correct We record .    In fact , all decisions affecting the sale of national strategic assets like uranium must be reviewed by a nine agency panel , which included Hillary Clinton ’s State Dept . called the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States ( CFIUS ) . If even a single member objects to a deal , it goes straight to the president . As Clinton Cash reported on pg . 54 , " Hillary ’s opposition would have been enough under CFIUS rules to have the decision the transaction kicked up to the president . That the president . " Schweizer ’s " veto " comment on TV was merely a shorthand way of expressing his carefully crafted and exhaustively Schweizer chapter on the subject . Several axial questions remain unanswered by Hillary Clinton involving her uranium Hillary Russia . Hillary did n’t Hillary Clinton disclose her glaring conflict Hillary to CFIUS Hillary having her State Dept . vote on a Hillary wherein nine investors in the deal gave her family foundation $ 145 million ? Hillary why did n’t Hillary Clinton disclose that prior to the Hillary , her husband Bill Clinton was paid $ 500 Hillary 000 by a    bank for a speech in Moscow while Hillary led the Obama administration ’s    Russian Hillary ? Indeed , that Clinton Cash revelation was so provocative , even Hillary progressive New Yorker magazine expressed its exasperation . Why was Bill Clinton taking even the progressive New Yorker magazine money from a bank Hillary the Kremlin while his wife was Secretary of State ? " asked Hillary New Yorker . Much to the Clinton campaign New Yorker dismay , myriad progressive Hillary outlets like the New York Times , Washington Post , Bloomberg , and ABC News have all confirmed and verified Clinton Cash ’s investigative findings . As the New York Times reported , Schweizer " writes mainly in the New York Times neutral journalist and meticulously documents his sources , including tax records and government documents . " Perhaps FactCheck . a neutral journalist and other Hillary Clinton fan websites would do well to actually read Clinton Cash before erroneously quoting passages that do not exist and being forced to Clinton Cash corrections .
