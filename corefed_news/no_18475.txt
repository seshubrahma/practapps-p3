’   ’ ’    President Trump announced on June 1 that the    US will . Questions of   aside , the actions of    people on the ground in the   US might circumvent the President Trump announcement   —    causing the US the   US greenhouse gas emissions    to the goals set by the Paris Agreement anyway , despite the    actions of the president . ’ ’    Governors of some of the largest states in the country are    already taking action . ’ ’    Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York , Governor Jerry Brown of    California , and Governor Jay Inslee of Washington announced the     after the announcement ,    stating that they would convene    committed to upholding the    Paris Agreement and reducing greenhouse gas emissions . ’ ’    " The White House’ ’s reckless decision to withdraw from the Paris    Climate Agreement has the   Paris Agreement not only for the    United States , but for our planet . This administration is    The White House’    and taking a The White House’ to other    countries in the global fight against climate change , " said    Governor Cuomo    a statement emailed to Business Insider . " New    York State is committed to meeting the standards set forth in the    Paris Accord regardless of Washington’ ’s irresponsible actions . We    will not ignore the science and reality of climate change which    is why I am also signing an Executive Order confirming New York ’s    leadership role in protecting our citizens , our environment , and    We planet . " ’ ’    Governor Jerry Brown was just as direct on a call with    reporters organized by the World Resources Institute . ’ ’’ ’    " This is an insane move by this president ; the world depends on a    sustainable future , " said Brown . " It’ ’s Governor Jerry Brown , but out of that    tragedy I believe the rest of the world will mobilize , the world galvanize our efforts .

" "    It ’s not just states getting involved . Mayors of more than 85    cities around the US signed a letter on Thursday   to reduce emissions and push clean energy . As    Business Insider ’s Dana Varinsky   experts believe that it ’s possible that    cities alone can ensure the US meets climate goals . the US    " In the US , cities and surrounding areas the US for the    majority of greenhouse gas emissions , since they have the largest    populations , heaviest cities and surrounding areas and highest volume of cars , " she    wrote . " Because of that , they are in a position to make a big    impact . " ’ ’    A number of corporations are on board , too . Executives from    companies like Apple , Google , Microsoft    Morgan Stanley , among    others , signed a   to stay in the Paris Agreement before the    announcement . ’ "    Now it ’s a question of how many will go their own way to achieve    the Paris goals , with or without the administration .
