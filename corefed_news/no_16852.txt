Washington ( CNN ) Thousands of hacked emails from Hillary Clinton ’s campaign chairman , John Podesta , were posted online Friday evening , including what appears to be excerpts from transcripts of    speeches Hillary Clinton’s gave to Wall Street companies after leaving the State Department . WikiLeaks , which has been alleged to work with Russia , posted more than 2 , 000 emails from Podesta and promises to post more from a trove of more than 50 , 000 the group said the group has access to .   The Hillary Clinton’s campaign would not confirm the authenticity of any of the documents but has not disputed the contents . Hillary Clinton’s ’s comments to financial firms , if legitimate , would validate what supporters of Bernie Sanders long said about Hillary Clinton’s : Hillary Clinton’s is a fake populist who is really out of touch with the middle class . But the timing of the leaks , well after the Democratic primary and the same night video emerged of Donald Trump bragging about being able to grope women , could blunt any political impact . About a week after Bernie Sanders raised the issue in a January debate , the campaign ’s head of research , Tony Carrk , sent around the excerpts , apparently provided by " HWA " ( likely referring to the Harry Walker Agency , a firm representing Clinton and other    speakers ) to Podesta and other top campaign officials , including Podesta and Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri .   the excerpts shed light on Clinton ’s Clinton Wall Street behind closed doors , as well as her positions on Clinton such as trade and regulation .   Clinton ’s presidential Clinton sought to cast the former secretary of state as a fighter for the middle class , someone who will stand up to monied interests and corporations , and advocate on behalf of people who have seen wages stagnate over eight years under President Barack Obama .   In one 2014 speech , Clinton admits to being Clinton kind of far removed " from the struggles of the middle class . the middle class father loved to complain about big business and big government , but we had a solid middle class upbringing , " she said in the Clinton . " . .. And now , obviously , I ’m kind of far removed because the life I ’ve lived and the economic , you know , fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy , but I have n’t forgotten it . "   Russian involvement ? The emails released Friday range from menial email blasts and newsletters to highly sensitive internal campaign discussions from inside the Clinton campaign as they were facing a strong primary the Clinton campaign from Sanders . And they come just hours after top the Clinton campaign security officials accused Russia of trying to influence the US elections through    hacks .   US accuses Russia of trying to interfere with Russia election , Podesta fired off a series of tweets Friday night , blasting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and pointing to Russia as the source of the Russia , although there is no official link between his specific emails and hacks by Podesta . " I ’m not Russia about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election the Russians Donald Trump , " Podesta tweeted Friday night . In Podesta tweet , he said , " Do n’t Podesta time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked . " The Clinton campaign declined to confirm whether the emails were Podesta ’s . " Earlier today Podesta the US government removed any reasonable doubt that the Kremlin has weaponized WikiLeaks to meddle in our election and benefit Donald Trump ’s candidacy , " Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said in Clinton statement Friday night . " We are not going to confirm the US government authenticity of stolen documents released by Julian Assange who has made no secret of his desire to damage Hillary Clinton Julian Assange " Caplin also Clinton concerns that Russian Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin could have doctored the content in the emails , saying , " Guccifer 2 . 0 has already proven the warnings of top national security officials that documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated Russian misinformation campaign . "   Sanders Russian speech transcripts , For many Julian Assange supporters , including some who remain Julian Assange of Clinton , the release of Clinton ’s paid speech transcripts is too Clinton too late . Sanders made Clinton ’s speeches to Goldman Julian Assange and other Clinton a cornerstone of his stump speeches , regularly slamming Clinton Julian Assange the private remarks . " I kind Clinton think if you ’re going to be paid $ 225 , 000 for a speech , it must be a fantastic speech , " Sanders said during a speech in Warren Julian Assange Michigan . " A brilliant speech which you would want to share with the American people . " He regularly added that the remarks must Julian Assange " Shakespearean " given Clinton the private remarks . With Sanders’ urging , the Clinton caught hold among his supporters . Protesters at Clinton events Julian Assange yelled " Release your transcripts " Clinton the phrase became a commonly used hashtag on social media . But the reality of Friday ’s release is that these partial transcripts would have had more impact had they been released in March , not October     especially these partial transcripts ’s comments on trade . After calling the Clinton Pacific Partnership the " gold standard " as secretary of state , Clinton has said publicly that she now does not Clinton the deal . " Clinton oppose it now , I ’ll oppose it after the election she now does not support the deal and I ’ll oppose it she now does not support the deal President , " Clinton said earlier this year she now does not support the deal Warren , Michigan Clinton But in a 2013 speech , Clinton told an audience that her " dream is Clinton hemispheric common market , Clinton open trade and open borders , some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it , powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere . " Clinton has publicly said that she believes in trade Clinton but has made running Clinton the way certain trade deals are enforced    including the North American Free Trade agreement    a key to her outreach to union and white working class voters Clinton " I am not satisfied with the status quo , I am not telling you everything is peachy keen , " Clinton said about trade in a July speech in Clinton . " I am telling you we have made progress but we have work to do . "   ’You need we a public and a private position’ While Clinton ’s comments at the paid speeches are different Clinton what she usually says , Clinton has been up front Clinton in public    Clinton the fact that she and Bill Clinton have vaulted from the middle Clinton to wealth since they came onto the national political scene in the late she and Bill Clinton .   " Bill and I have been blessed , " Clinton said in Raleigh in September . " We Clinton n’t come from millionaire families . My husband "Bill and I father died before he was born . "   She added , " My husband’s father struggled , they worked hard My husband’s father And America gave him the chance They get a good education , pursue My husband’s dreams , end up being president . "   My husband’s a 2013 speech , Clinton told members of the National    Council , Clinton you need both a public and a private position " in politics .   " I mean , politics is like sausage being made , " she said . " It is unsavory , and Clinton always has been that way , but we usually It up where we need to be . But if everybody ’s watching we you know , all of the back room discussions and the deals , you know , then people get a little nervous , to say the least . So , you need both a public and a private position . " State Department technology , Clinton also weighed in on her use of technology at the State Department     an Clinton that would later plague her campaign when it was revealed she exclusively used a Clinton email server to conduct State Clinton business .   " When I got to State Department Department , it was still against the rules to State Department or let all Foreign Service Officers have access to a Blackberry , " Clinton said in August 2014 . " You could n’t have desktop computers when Colin Powell was there . "   She also spoke about how the State Department was targeted by hackers " Clinton hour , more than State Department . "   " And we knew it was going on when I would go to China , or I would go to Russia , we would leave all of our electronic equipment on the plane , with the batteries we , because this is we new frontier , " said Clinton .   Carrk , the man who wrote the hacked document , currently serves at Clinton ’s research director and is part of Clinton ’s campaign inner circle , trusted Clinton he has been part of Clinton ’s Clinton debate preparations .   Tony Carrk worked for Clinton Clinton her 2008 Clinton and later led rapid response research at the Democratic National Clinton . her campaign ’s 2016 campaign , the Democratic operative lead the research operation at the Center Clinton American Progress .
