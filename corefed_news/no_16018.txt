Tim Kaine is getting the most buzz within Democratic circles as a potential running mate for Hillary Clinton .               And CNN ’s Jeff Zeleny says that ’s for good reason . Or reasons .               " Tim Kaine is from a red state , Tim Kaine now represents a purple state , but Spanish .

As one Democrat pointed out to me in this week in bringing up Vilsack , somebody who is a sort of reliable person for campaigning and governing also would have no impact at all on the Senate . If you think about Hillary Clinton other options , almost all of you think about her other options would have some impact on control of the Senate .

CNN ’s    Henderson harkened back to 2012 , when coal and energy issues were part of the GOP playbook while Democrats courted Latinos in the Denver suburbs .
