    " Welcome to fuckyoupalooze , "    offers on Run the Jewels 3 , and    might as well be the album ’s alternate title . Since the initial 2013    of the rappers Killer Mike and    Run the Jewels have built a rep as fierce protest musicians , but their a rep is best understood as an omnidirectional middle finger . Over the course of their a rep release , they a rep nuns , bunny rabbits , " moms from jazzercise , " and general politeness : " I do n’t know how to not spit like a lout , "    says , adding , " I ’ll spill a pound of my kids on your couch . " It would seem like a good moment for loutish spitting , given the tenor of online discourse and given the     headed to the Oval Office . Not long ago , Run the Jewels came across as total outsiders , with the smart sorrowful conscience of Atlanta ’s Killer Mike and the    agitation of Brooklyn ’s    combining for a vibe out of step with the rap mainstream and much of American popular culture . But lately their finely detailed ,     bombast seems strangely   : In style if not in substance , they not the rush of giddy , combative pessimism on the rise for both sides of the ideological spectrum . A Tribe Called Quest and the Shadow of Trump , To be clear , they A Tribe firmly on the left side of that spectrum .    stopped wearing red hats because of Donald Trump Killer Mike worked as a Bernie Sanders surrogate . But Mike Donald Trump Killer Mike worked as a Bernie Sanders surrogate opposed Hillary Clinton throughout the general election , saying she Hillary Clinton " the same " as her Hillary Clinton and alternately issuing " stay the fuck home " and " vote locally " messages to black people in the campaign ’s final days . He Donald Trump Killer Mike worked as a Bernie Sanders surrogate possibly the leading cultural champion of the     mindset that took such a hold on portions of the traditional Democratic base that it may have swung the the general election and he Donald Trump Killer Mike worked as a Bernie Sanders surrogate not softening now . " Choose the lesser of the evil people , and the devil still gon’ win , " he Donald Trump Killer Mike worked as a Bernie Sanders surrogate . " It could all be over tomorrow , kill our masters and start again . " The fantasy of erasing the powerful and starting society again , of justice achieved through total rupture , has always been essential to the thrill of Run the Jewels’ music . It ’s in the mechanized warfare of   ’s production , where    textures click and clack over propulsion recalling The Prodigy ’s angry breakbeats . It ’s It the   .   verbal teamwork creating rhyme patterns and    that are complementary ,    and out of step with what you ’re hearing elsewhere . And it ’s It the    lyrics that swirl raunch and introspection and agitprop . Run the Jewels 3 is the longest of their releases —   14 songs , 51 minutes —   and it must be said their shtick their this scale does become a bit repetitive . Still , the highlights are enormous . " Down " makes a poignant start , putting the entire Run the Jewels project into perspective by establishing how a desperate past can color someone ’s successful present . Over downbeat washes of sound , Mike talks about his fear Mike having to return to drug dealing and summarizes the Bill of Rights as it most the Bill of Rights pertains to those like him : Mike One time for the freedom of speeches    Two time for the right to hold heaters    Just skip to the fifth , with the cops in the house , close your mouth and pray to your Jesus . " From there , the duo vaults through a series of brag jams that double as    sessions , the musical geography defined less by verses and choruses than by clusters of epic moments . One comes when a deadpan female voice interrupts   ’s claim about what ’s between his legs : " I got a unicorn horn for a —   ‘ stop . ’ " Another comes as the beat switches between the songs " Legend Has It " and " Call Ticketron , " the latter a    rave spiked with snippets of old commercials for Madison Square Garden seats . While the swagger often betrays a political sensibility —   Mike : " Domain eminent , we the preeminent " —   eventually they shift the swagger often betrays a political sensibility —  Mike: "Domain eminent, we the preeminent" —   into more serious , solemn modes . It ’s the swagger often betrays a political sensibility —  Mike: "Domain eminent, we the preeminent" —   solemn , and memorable , when the two give their own the swagger often betrays a political sensibility —  Mike: "Domain eminent, we the preeminent" —   spins on grief for " Thursday in the Danger Room . " As is typical ,    focuses more on self and Mike more on community , but both deliver potent testimony . Earlier , the spacey " 2100 " contemplates pending civilizational catastrophes , with the title hinting either at the date of total disaster or of    repair —   though in Run the Jewels’ worldview , of course , these can be the same thing . The talk of inevitable holocaust and war hits hard after , say , recent famous tweets about nukes , but the song was written before the election and the sentiment has been the same all along for the band . " I ’ve felt this dread pretty much my entire life , "    told Vulture . " I think we live in a bit of a bubble here . And that bubble a bubble here . Everybody ’s like , ‘ Holy shit , things might not be fine if we turn the TV off . ’ " Throughout , the rappers display South    disregard for decorum , most especially on the religious defilement anthem " Panther Like a Panther . " This obscenity is n’t simple hijinks to hear them tell it , it This obscenity a This obscenity effect of political bravery .   " I ’m a pervert with purpose that make you question your purpose , " Killer Mike raps .   ’s take : " You talk clean and bomb hospitals    So I speak with the foulest mouth possible . " Is this stuff actually going to shock people out of complacency ? Maybe a few . But Run the Jewels raps first for its    fanbase the Jewels and the people who shell out for remix albums made entirely of cat meows are presumably already converted . The spectacle of        rhetoric works best to cinch performer and listener , a dynamic that ’s    these days —   even outside of music .
