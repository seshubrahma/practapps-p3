A new study that explores the effects of    vouchers on Catholic parishes and vouchers on Catholic parishes schools finds that while vouchers may help keep a church financially afloat , the expansion of government funding leads to a decline in private donations from parishioners . [ The study , a working paper by the    National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) is titled " Beyond the Classroom : The Implications of School Vouchers for Church Finances . " Notre Dame University economics associate professor Daniel Hungerman and colleagues Kevin Rinz , and Jay Frymark analyzed financial data from Catholic parishes in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , using information from both the parishes and Notre Dame University economics associate professor Daniel Hungerman and colleagues Kevin Rinz, and Jay Frymark schools .   " Notre Dame University economics associate professor Daniel Hungerman and colleagues Kevin Rinz, and Jay Frymark show that vouchers are now a dominant source of funding for many churches , " the researchers write . " Parishes in our sample running    schools get more revenue from vouchers than from worshipers . We also find that voucher expansion prevents church closures and mergers . " The authors continue : Despite these results , we fail to find evidence that vouchers promote religious behavior : voucher expansion causes significant declines in church donations and church spending on    religious purposes . The meteoric growth of vouchers appears to offer financial stability for congregations while at the same time diminishing congregations religious activities . While voucher programs for Catholic schools have already been on the rise in nearly half of all states in America , the study is released as the topic of school choice and    school vouchers has risen to national prominence with the election of President Donald Trump . On Friday , President Donald Trump and U. S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos visited St. Andrew Catholic School in Pine Hills , Florida , to highlight the administration ’s plan to offer children from poorly performing public schools other education opportunities . In his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday , Trump and U. S. Education said , " Education is the civil rights issue of our time . " " I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth , including millions of    and Latino children , " his added . Catholic schools are the most common type of religious private school in the United States . Nevertheless , Catholic schools have faced a significant economic downturn Catholic schools In 2011 , the National Catholic Educational Association ( NCEA ) reported that , between 2000 and 2010 , the number of Catholic schools dropped from 8 , 146 to 6 , 980   —    a loss of 117 schools per year . Additionally , Catholic elementary and secondary school enrollment fell 22 percent during that same period , from 2 , 647 , 301 to 2 , 065 , 872 . The NBER researchers observe : Brinig and Garnett ( 2014 ) note several reasons for dwindling enrollment , including competition from charter schools , struggles to appeal to    populations ( e. g. Hispanics ) and increasing tuition costs . They summarize the situation of Catholic schools   populations (e. g. Hispanics) : " The Catholic school financial model —   which depended upon the generosity of parishioners in pews that are now empty and the free labor of nuns who are now retired —   can not be sustained . " Catholic schools , the authors continue , have turned to diverse populations , including    students from    families , to remain open . The government funding from vouchers has had an impact on both the schools and their parishes , they add . The The government funding from vouchers assert : The government funding from vouchers find that The government funding from vouchers voucher policy is , unsurprisingly , associated with increases in voucher revenues for parishes with schools . We also find that voucher expansion prevents parish closures and mergers .    …      We further see how voucher expansion impacts parishes’ finances . Interestingly , and the above results notwithstanding , we find no evidence that vouchers subsidize parish religious activity beyond the operation of religious schools . In fact , our estimates repeatedly suggest the opposite . Vouchers cause a significant decrease in spending on    religious purposes such as religious staff salaries , mission support , and church maintenance . We also find that voucher programs lead to a significant decrease in church donations . " Vouchers thus may help ensure the survival of churches , but may do so while diminishing churches’    religious activities , " the authors conclude . Writing at National Catholic Register , Charlotte Hays observes that NCEA senior consultant Heather Gossart has " grave issues " with the NBER study . " The study drew conclusions that I do n’t the NBER study valid , " she said , disturbed by the finding that Charlotte Hays vouchers for Catholic schools is associated with parish dependence on them . " Vouchers do n’t fund parishes and Catholic schools , " she said . " That would be a Charlotte Hays of    separation . " As a supporter of the Common Core standards , NCEA has welcomed the partnership with government in Catholic education . In 2013 , the organization was awarded $ 76 , 593 by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation   —    the primary source of private funding for the promotion of the nationalized Common Core standards   —    to help implement the standards in Catholic schools . In 2015 , many Catholic school parents and educators were outraged when NCEA invited Common Core " architect " David Coleman to serve as the keynote for its annual convention the following spring . Regarding the NCEA effect of a drop in parish contributions , Gossart added that contributions are " a reflection of the community in which a parish finds itself . " On the issue of vouchers diminishing a parish other religious activities , Dan Guernsey , director of    programs at the Cardinal Newman Society , observes that a parish supporting a parish school itself is its most essential religious activity . " There is a parish school itself better way to evangelize the youth of the parish ( whom it must be remembered are the parish   —    they are just the parish at grade 3 ! the parish   than an authentic Catholic education , " Guernsey said . What the NBER study does not specifically address is perhaps the primary concern of    vouchers for    schools : the amount of regulation the acceptance of government funds brings along with it . In a 2010 study at Cato Institute the acceptance of government funds Andrew Coulson studied the question of school vouchers and increased regulation of private schools . He concluded that " vouchers   …      impose Andrew Coulson substantial and statistically significant additional regulatory burden on participating private schools . " Voucher programs , Coulson concluded , are more likely to " suffocate Andrew Coulson very markets to which they aim to expand access , " because state Voucher programs —   which invariably come with state regulation —   are directly transferred , in the form of vouchers , to parents to spend in an alternate education setting . In January of 2015 , 40 conservative groups in Indiana submitted an agenda to their state lawmakers that urged cutting regulations for private 40 conservative groups in Indiana that agreed to accept school vouchers . " State lawmakers should cut all but the most basic of transparency requirements on private voucher schools , given that parents and private accreditation agencies already place higher demands on private schools than any bureaucrat can generate , " the coalition asserted . " Particularly egregious is the requirement that    schools administer the new assessment aligned to Indiana ’s      standards . " Dan Thiele , a conservative activist from northern Indiana , said about the coalition ’s agenda , " We wo n’t the coalition brighter students by creating more government programs and expanding the role of government .
