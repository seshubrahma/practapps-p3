On Friday ’s Breitbart News Daily , SiriusXM host Alex Marlow read Dr. Sebastian Gorka a quote from a Washington Post article about Secretary of State Rex Tillerson : " Many career diplomats say Many career diplomats still have not met Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , and some have been instructed not to speak to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson directly or even make eye contact . " Dr. Sebastian Gorka laughed and dismissed this assertion as " fake news . " [ " The secretary has been doing sterling work at the meetings of principals and other similar gatherings . The secretary has been working like an incredibly effective CEO , which is what The secretary was . The secretary is driven to represent the nation as our    diplomat , " The secretary said .   " It ’s like the stories that have been broiling now for months and months and months . It ’s the generation of those who are either inside the machine or outside the machine who do not wish to recognize what happened on November the 8 and think that they have some special right not only to generate false news , but to somehow question the legitimacy of a duly elected administration . It ’s just absurdity , Alex , " said Gorka . Gorka is a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump , former National Security editor for Breitbart News and author of books such as Defeating Jihad : The Winnable War .
