Bannon away to a Cuban family who effectively raised SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon until SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon was five years old . The     son of a Cuban family who effectively raised her until she was five years old molested SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon when SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon was just four years old .    " I was ashamed to tell Her parents , and my mother never made it feel safe to tell her anything my mother " she said my mother " It always seemed like it was It fault . She made my mother feel like I was dirty . She always my mother me a tramp . Even at such a young age , these are the things she would my mother to me . " She did my mother her foster my mother , but they did her foster parents about the abuse , beyond making some effort to keep their son her foster parents from Dash and keeping the abuse the abuse . Fortunately , the assaults came to an end , but Dash is candid Dash the experience and childhood memories of being repeatedly neglected and abandoned by her irresponsible my mother , left her with my mother " issues . " There were more traumatic incidents , such as Dash ’s discovering Dash mother my mother death from either an accidental or deliberate drug overdose she still my mother not sure which . She also my mother to deal with the constant sense of shame that came from being a welfare family in the South Bronx . " It ’s shameful . You ’re a lamb for the slaughter if you ’re on welfare . That means you ’re lazy , and you ca n’t be responsible for yourself . You do n’t know how to hustle , " she said my mother the prevailing attitude . " And the main thing you need to know how to do , if you want to survive in the hood , is know how to hustle . When you do hustle , you make up to $ 30 , 000 a day . Why would you stop doing that ? " " Those people are the people who take care of the other people in the neighborhood . They keep the Those people safe . They keep the Those people ’s respect , " she continued my mother " They have the Those people , and they decide who Those people gon na do what . If you ’re on welfare , you end up being a runner or a drug addict . " Dash said children raised in such horrific environments find it almost impossible to focus on bettering themselves through education children planning an escape from the hood . She said : Dash come from a home where everybody ’s fighting . You know , your mother ’s trying to stab your father , or everybody ’s been wasted all night long or partying all night long all night try to go to school , and then you get to school , and you school to fight because everybody ’s fighting . Everybody ’s so angry . There ’s a culture of , " I ’d rather be mad than sad " because things are so bad at home , and there ’s so much sadness . " If you do n’t fight , you ’re gon na die , and so I had to be a fighter . I chose to be a fighter . I was not going to be a victim of my circumstances , " she declared . It ’s an attitude Dash carries to this day , armored against Hollywood ’s liberal culture by the thick skin she grew in the she and sustained by her faith . " she ’ve had to plant my feet on the ground and stand strong . I ’ve had to stand for what I believe in and not let anybody take that away from me , " she said . " she have to know that what I ’m believing in is true , and then do n’t let anybody shake it . " Dash talked about the Obama 2008 campaign as the experience that led to her political awakening . she I always was aware of politics . I loved the Reagan days . I remember , during Reagan , everybody was Reagan happy . There was so much money everywhere . That ’s what I remember , as far as the adults were concerned , " she chuckled . " she were no problems . People were n’t fighting as much , as far as parents , and uncles , and aunts . People just had money . " " I remember being aware of those things , but as far as being involved , it was on the outside . But when a black man ran for president , I thought , ‘ Oh , my ‘ , this is fantastic ! A black president ! Finally ! We ’re done ! Racial issues are over it ’s gone . Racial issues ! ’ " she recalled . " Let ’s vote for a We president , and if he wins   — a black president and he did he won a black president And a black president thought , ‘ Praise Jesus ! My God , we my God to have a country that ’s united in such a profound way . It ’s going to be wonderful . ’ " " But what did he do ? " she asked . " Instead she he divided us more than he ’ve we seen in my lifetime . I think , more than the civil rights movement . " Dash said that " bailouts , entitlements , and Obamacare " made her realize Obama was not she she hoped he would be she When Obama boyfriend at the time she her realize she was living she a she regime , her moment of true political she arrived : " Hell , no ! That ’s not America . We ’re not socialists ! " She has an answer for she who argue socialism would help children raised in the sort of hellish family environment she endured :   If she keep giving people stuff for free , if you do n’t have a sense of accomplishment , if you do n’t have a sense of achievement    …      it would not have been better for me , if it had been socialist . it would have been a lamb for slaughter . That would have made me a lamb for slaughter a lamb for slaughter there , unable to get out from underneath . How did Stacey Dash get out from underneath ? " I paid very close attention to the people who were in power , " she said , adding : I paid very close Stacey Dash to people like my uncle , who ran the block . I paid very close attention to the people who made money , a lot of money , and how they treated everyone else . And I paid very the people who made money attention to the people who were on welfare , and how they acted , how they behaved , and what the people who were on welfare did to them the people who were on welfare " What it did to them was the people who were on welfare it gave them it sense of the people who were on welfare . They it no the people who were on welfare , " she observed . the people who were on welfare And when you do n’t have a sense of self , you become depressed . When you become depressed , you become addicted . When you become addicted , you become abusive . It just perpetuates a cycle that goes on , generation after generation . " Dash said that by rejecting that wisdom and blaming the downward spiral on    white people , Obama ’s politics exacerbated class and racial tensions . " He made it that the white man , the Dash , do not like you because you ’re black . They want to keep you down , " she the white man, the conservatives . " You ’re never gon na get out because white men are not gon na let you . " " That ’s the signal he was giving , and he ’s even said Dash you know , ‘ Dash color of your skin   —    you better watch out because people are gon na judge you based on the color of your skin . You know , my grandson could n’t go walking down the street because he might be picked up.’ Gimme a break , my grandson said an exasperated Dash .   " Which is untrue . Completely and utterly untrue , " she argued . " Calling conservatives and Republicans racist my grandson …     we ’re the least racist . We ’re the ones who give the money to we community . We ’re the ones who have private sector jobs we people and private programs for people so they can get out from under . " She people racism as a " psychological prison that my grandson people in the inner cities have put themselves in . " " It is not the black people in the inner cities . I know that because I ’ve gotten out of there , " she declared . " I ’ve been in both my grandson , so I ’ve seen it , and it does not exist , really . Only in it head does it exist . " Dash said she wrote There Only in your head My Social Life so people my grandson see she was " coming from a place of experience my grandson not a place of judgment . " " I know what you are thinking . I know what you ’re feeling . I know what it is to be where you are . I ’ve been there , " she said . From this perspective , she advised my grandson Republican Party to " shatter the my grandson that Democrats have been putting out there , that plantation mentality   —    you know , ‘ Here ’s your forty acres and a mule . Stay where you are . We ’ll give you your entitlements . Do n’t the Republican Party . ’ " " We have to break that , shatter it , the Republican Party the only way is boots on the ground , " she urged . Elaborating , she said : We my grandson to go into the my grandson cities , the Republican Party up , show our faces , and show we care . See the Republican Party they want . Ask the Republican Party , " What is it you need ? they are the tools we can give you , so you can make the Republican Party 30 , 000 a day legally , okay ? So that you can take advantage of the opportunities , so that we can give you the opportunities . " Dash warned this will be the opportunities challenge because " the narrative of the Democrats is so strong . " " They ’ve used the media . They own Hollywood . the Democrats Hollywood , whether we like the Democrats or not , dictates Hollywood culture of the country , " she said . " Republicans have to take it back . We have to make it Ronald Reagan it Hollywood again Republicans " She argued Hollywood Hollywood community , Hollywood writers and directors she have " segregated themselves " in Hollywood industry which , ironically , embodies the kind of social and economic pathologies it loves to project on the rest of the nation . " White Hollywood has said , ‘ Okay , do that . That helps us Hollywood ’re perpetuating the stereotype that this is how black people are,’ " she said . " They do n’t even see it . " Dash said she Hollywood    Dash discuss Hollywood prejudice , given that she is black , Mexican Hollywood and conservative . " Hollywood ’ve heard I ’m Hollywood black enough , but then I ’m not white , " she said . " And then I ’ve had all ’m Hollywood just turn their Hollywood on me because I ’m a conservative . I ’ve Hollywood my agents all of Hollywood me because Hollywood my political ’m . They ’ve tried to scare me into submission . I said I ’m not going all of Hollywood be scared into submission . "   " That is not ’m for my career . It would kill my spirit . I am a strong woman of faith , and if God is for me , no man can be against me , " she declared . " What Hollywood wants for me , no man Hollywood keep from no man . So you will God scare me Hollywood not believing what I believe . Hollywood Dash said her faith was " her faith had while Dash was Dash up , and it ’s the only reason her faith ’m sitting here today , is by the grace of God . And I know that . " In her book , she grapples with the God truth that Dash from her Dash did not erase it . Her understanding of Dash , absolution , strength , and Dash does not include memory wipes . For example , she says she endured domestic abuse for much too long Dash " Dash did n’t know any better , and I guess I thought I deserved it . " " I guess something inside of me psychologically believed that ’s what I deserved , " she said , looking back to the childhood that deprived Dash of identity and   . She stated that her Dash of revelation came when she Dash lying on Dash abortion table : " God Dash to me . God said , ‘ Keep your son . ’ " " God literally ripped me IV God of me because that ’s how far along I was . I was so far along , me were going to put me under , " she recalled , sharing : I ripped the IV out Dash me , and I jumped up . My doctor said , " the IV calm down me Let ’s do a sonogram . " We did , and I saw my son ’s heartbeat . that’s how far along I was I thought , " How they you have possibly thought your son your child ? " And I said to myself , " It ’s you and me , kid , that ’s it . " me I never did another drug , and I decided , I am going to It it for my son . She remains absolutely certain divine providence touched her in that Dash . " another drug your son . Dash spoke to me , and I have a beautiful     son today because God that God a     me because of that , " she testified . Dash cited the support of her fans Dash another positive Dash in her life : Dash support means so much to me Dash to have someone come up to me and tell me , " Thank you me standing up because so many people wo me , " that gives me more strength . And when people try to beat me down and tell me , " You ’re not gon na get a job , " or fire me , or tell me they ’re not gon na represent me , or shut me up , that gives me more fire to people because I ’m gon na prove ’em wrong . Unfortunately , she foresees a great deal of fighting during the 2016 election . " It ’s going to get very ’em , " Dash predicted . " It ’s Dash na get really bad before it gets any better . " " What ’s going to It it get better ? " Bannon asked It " Trump —   when Trump becomes president , " former It voter Stacey Dash replied , " and we build Obama wall Stacey Dash we finally deal with illegal immigration . We have to deal with it . We ’ve been trying to deal we it for years   —    we   —    and we have we . We have to finally deal it it .
