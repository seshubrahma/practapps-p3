Carney writes : The top recipient of money [ Tim Carney the 2014 midterm election ] from the financial sector was Sen. Cory Booker , who pocketed $ 4 . 5 million from financial executives and PACs . Within that sector , Booker dominated among cash from real the financial sector ( Booker 50 percent more than the Senate   ) . He also dominated in Wall Street money . Carney Booker that Booker ’s support for the policies Tim Carney his corporatist Booker been   .    publications , Booker notes , have described Booker as " disturbingly tight Tim Carney Wall Street and entrenched Booker interests " —    a politician who " shares a worldview with the financial elites who fund his campaigns , " and who " represents the interests Booker both Wall Street and Silicon Valley . " By contrast , Sessions Wall Street as the intellectual    of the conservative    populist movement that emphasizes the need to enact an agenda that puts the interests of American workers first . Sessions , Carney writes , has clashed with the Silicon Valley tycoons and " Wall Street titans who have bankrolled Booker Silicon Valley rise " —   most notably , on the issue of immigration , where Sessions has pushed for policies that prioritize the job and wage opportunities of working Americans over corporatists’ desire for cheap labor . In recent months , Cotton has seemed primed to take up Sessions’ mantle as the leader of this populist movement in the Senate . In particular , Cotton has become a vocal champion for American workers of all backgrounds against Cotton      policies lobbied for by corporate special interests and advanced by Washington politicians like Cory Booker , who represent the interests of the donor class . In a New York Times    last month , Cotton wrote :    Trump now has a clear mandate not only to Cotton illegal immigration , but also to finally cut the    influx of    immigrants that undermines American workers   …      For too long , our immigration policy has skewed toward the interests of the wealthy and powerful : Employers get cheaper labor , and professionals get cheaper personal services like housekeeping . We now need an immigration policy that focuses less on the most powerful and more on everyone else   …      In some quarters , proposals like these invoke cries of " nativism " and " xenophobia . " But recent immigrants are the very Americans who have to compete with new immigrants for jobs . Far from being    this proposal would give recent arrivals a better shot at higher wages , stable work and assimilation . Following Cotton ’s clarion call for an immigration policy that benefits American workers , the Center for Immigration Studies’ Mark Krikorian wrote a piece titled " Immigration : As Sessions Moves On , Cotton Steps Up . " In the post , Krikorian assured voters that Cotton Sessions , Congress ’s tireless advocate for an the Center for Immigration Studies’ Mark Krikorian First immigration policy , departs the Senate to join the incoming President ’s cabinet , American workers should " fear not " as " Tom Cotton has reported for duty .
