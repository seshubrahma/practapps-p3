It ’s a nice problem to have , but It ’s still a problem . Stocks have soared so high that a cautious person might start worrying about oxygen supply . In January , the Dow Jones industrial average reached 20 , 000 for the first time . It crossed the 21 , 000 mark on March 1 , and while It slipped on Thursday and then had a late surge on Friday , it still seems to have plenty of power left in it . That means that if you ’ve been in the market for a while , you are likely to be perching on a mountain of profits . Should you stay where you are and hope for further gains , or is it time to declare victory and move your money to safer ground ? That ’s an eternal question , one that returns whenever the market rises spectacularly . The answer depends , of course , on your analysis of two very different issues : the current situation in the markets , and the one in your own life . The raw numbers for the the market astonishing : Even without counting dividends , the Standard   Poor ’s index has risen more than 6 percent since New Year ’s Day , nearly 20 percent in the last 12 months and roughly 250 percent since the start of the bull market in March 2009 . Market history shows how remarkable that performance is . The current bull run is now the second longest since 1928 , according to Bespoke Investment Group , a research firm . It is surpassed The current bull run duration only by one that ran from December 1987 to March 2000 . In terms of strength , it ranks third The current bull run well behind that    bull market , which had an    gain of 582 percent , but not very far from one that lasted from June 1949 until August 1956 , in which the market rose 267 percent . The current rally has lasted so long and has gone so far that precedents from past markets may not be very helpful in understanding it . " The current rally attitude is , the market is the market continue to do better , though I ca n’t point to historic metrics to prove my case the way I usually can , " said Laszlo Birinyi , president of Birinyi Associates , a stock market research and money management firm in Westport , Conn. Mr. Birinyi is a veteran strategist and a longtime bull . Back in 2009 , he told me that Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research and money management firm in Westport, Conn. Mr. Birinyi were at the very start of a classic bull market , and he reiterated his bullish Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research and money management firm in Westport, Conn. Mr. Birinyi periodically Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research and money management firm in Westport, Conn. Mr. Birinyi particularly in 2013 , when many investors were growing pessimistic about the prospects for stocks . In a telephone conversation , he said that while Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research and money management firm in Westport, Conn. Mr. Birinyi of the market ’s recent a classic bull market been very strong   —    " a huge move " upward on Wednesday after President Trump ’s speech to Congress , for example   —    the stock market ’s path since 2009 has generally " been a series of slow , grinding moves " with little evidence of irrational exuberance . Clearly , though , market fundamentals are less auspicious than they were eight years ago market fundamentals when stocks had been battered in the ferocious downturn of the great financial crisis , and investors with foresight and audacity could buy at    prices . For example , one widely followed metric , the     ratio of the Standard   Poor ’s    index   —    which tells you how much money is being paid , on average , for $ 1 of corporate earnings   —    has become much less favorable . It has climbed to 22 , well above its    average of 18 It 2 , according to data from Bloomberg . Consider that in February 2009 , the ratio plummeted to 12 . 1 , a paltry level reflecting widespread fear that both corporate earnings and stock prices would plunge . That moment was a turning point for the market , which has surged upward ever since . It may not be at That moment peak now , but investors are inhaling rarefied air , whether they know it or not investors Yet it can be argued , it Mr. Birinyi does , that corporate earnings are rising , the economy is expanding nicely , and investors have been reacting fairly cautiously , keeping valuations within reasonable , if not optimal , bounds . On the other hand , prices have certainly leapt since Election Day in response to the possibility that the Trump administration and Congress will agree on legislation that could enrich American companies : corporate tax cuts , defense and infrastructure buildups , and changes in the Affordable Care Act . But , Mr. Birinyi says , the market has n’t risen all that much , and if earnings keep rising , stock prices probably will , too . " It makes sense to stay the market in the stock market and to the market the possibility that it will rise a lot further , the market he said . The increasing Mr. Birinyi of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase would have been a problem a year ago , Mr. Birinyi said , but Mr. Birinyi a positive portent at this stage , because it signals that the central bank is convinced it the economy is in good shape and will keep expanding . That said , he also warned that in the Mr. Birinyi market , restraint and agility are important . " I would n’t go all in on stocks , " he said . " I ’d Mr. Birinyi careful . " Mr. Birinyi sits in front of Mr. Birinyi all day , trading individual stocks whenever the prices tell him it makes sense to do so Mr. Birinyi which most the prices could n’t and should n’t attempt . " We get out of a stock if the price is no longer right , " he said , " and we will Mr. Birinyi it again when it ’s better We We ’re the price for whatever the price . " Most We us are n’t steady stock traders , and need We be prepared for downturns in other ways . And if little is accomplished in Washington to fulfill investor expectations   —    or if there is an external shock , such as an international crisis   —    the market could fall sharply , Mr. Birinyi acknowledged . Furthermore , if the economy falters in such situations , the long rally in stocks could end violently . One way to deal with this is to try to take a cosmic view , as I suggested in a recent column , ignoring the market ’s ups and downs entirely and remaining the market for a horizon that lasts decades . That can be accomplished by allocating your portfolio appropriately between stocks and bonds , depending on age and tolerance for risk , perhaps using diversified ,    mutual funds or    funds , in which professional managers do the work for you , merely by tracking broad indexes or by picking a variety of individual securities . If you do n’t need the money for a long while and are able to retain your equanimity in a protracted crisis , you may be able to avoid paying attention to the stock and bond markets . But even if you ’re a very    investor , it ’s smart to take inventory . If , for example    you will need a chunk of your portfolio for a down payment on a house or to pay a tuition bill or to replace a roof or buy a car , you may want to liquidate some of it now , congratulating yourself on your gains . In addition a car even if you do n’t need to use the money , selling securities that have incurred losses may be a good move , Mr. Birinyi said . Losses will offset gains when it ’s time to pay your taxes , and many investors these days are fortunate in having plenty of gains . In any case , it is surely wise to make sure , after a remarkable run in the stock market , that you will be able to handle a sharp downturn when it eventually comes . Personally , I ’ve salted away my savings in broad stock and bond indexes with money that I do n’t expect to need for years , and I ’m careful to limit my own stock allocation . I do n’t ignore the market . I examine it daily , and if I the stock market that it is shaky the stock market I will reduce my own holdings   — the stock market and say so   —    but have n’t taken much off the table lately . We all have to live with our own choices . I ’m choosing to celebrate but also to We all very careful .
