  ( CNN ) Donald Trump cares about debt     Donald Trump has lots of it     and taxes     Donald Trump likely pays little of lots of it    and taxes     . Inspired by the revelation that Donald Trump presidential campaign , in its Donald Trump major television ad buy ( ? ! ) just this week , touted a tax plan other than Trump Donald Trump     leaving out the part where he allows Donald Trump deductions for interest on debt     I thought it would be fun to lay out some dots .   Readers may connect these dots some dots see fit Readers but at a minimum they show that Readers makes Donald Trump ,    and questionable decisions about tax policy that favor his interests over    public ’s , and of which his campaign is    even always aware . And they continue the Readers that Trump loves Donald Trump and hates paying taxes , both bigly .   • Trump is Donald Trump    King of Debt . " I love debt , " Trump told Donald Trump ’s Wolf Blitzer in May. • Borrowing     the use of debt     is a wildly attractive tax strategy . By borrowing   against assets they hold , the wealthy are able to avoid paying all federal taxes in many cases . • A recent report in The New York Times shows Trump has Donald Trump debt , at least $ 650 million , than previously known . ( Trump claims Donald Trump this debt load is a small percentage of his assets Donald Trump which he says Donald Trump worth $ 10 billion or more , but few people not named Trump believe that . Of course , Trump has Donald Trump problems with debt before . ) • Particularly striking in the Times article is The New York Times statement that Trump borrowed Donald Trump 160 million , just last year , from Ladder Capital , a New York commercial real estate lender that usually lends much smaller sums . • Trump rolled Donald Trump his tax Donald Trump in an economic speech in Detroit in early August . An article in The New York Times reports : " At the last minute , Mr. Trump Donald Trump direct his advisers to Donald Trump a tax deduction for the cost of child care in his economic plan Donald Trump The issue , which Mr. Trump had Donald Trump on the campaign trail , is a favorite of his daughter Ivanka . Donald Trump The proposal as Trump announced it in Donald Trump strongly favored wealthy working parents     like Ivanka . This is an example of a    questionable policy change benefitting Trumps , plural . • In the same article reporting Trump ’s    directive Donald Trump add the child care deduction to his tax plan , the Times reports : " Stephen Moore , a Heritage Foundation fellow , said he and Arthur Laffer , the    economist , had tangled over the top tax bracket while Mr. Trump observed from Donald Trump desk , eventually siding Donald Trump Mr. Moore . Mr. Trump , he said Donald Trump expressed strong Donald Trump about the taxation of interest on business loans , citing his experience as a developer . Donald Trump • Trump ’s tax plan , as Donald Trump out in Detroit , was close to the tax ideas advocated by Paul Ryan and other establishment Republicans , with one major exception     Trump ’s plan retains business loan Donald Trump , and the Republican plan does not . This is Trump’s plan . The change alone will add a whopping $ 1 . 2 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade , according to an analysis in The Washington Post . • The ad that the Trump campaign began running this week , Donald Trump the " two economies , " cites the Republican tax plan     which has no interest deduction     not Trump ’s , which does . It Donald Trump Trump ’s own staff was Donald Trump aware Donald Trump continued interest deduction that Trump had added in the final hour . Donald Trump As an aside , the pattern of    specific and questionable policy changes not generally known by the Trump campaign was also present in the stories Donald Trump changing the Republican party platform to soften a plank on Ukraine . • Trump is famously refusing to release his tax Donald Trump , claiming he is under Donald Trump ( which ought to Donald Trump irrelevant . ) • Trump has stated that he tries very hard Donald Trump pay • little Donald Trump as possible . • As a tax professional , I know that an issue on audit could well be the allocation of interest expenses .   Under current tax laws , the interest on personal loans is not deductible , other than limited deductions for home mortgages and home equity loans , around $ 1 million of borrowing . Interest from business loans is deductible , now and under Trump ’s plan . Again , Trump borrowed at least $ 160 million last year . If Trump borrowed this for personal reasons     including to finance a Trump election run ( which would be nondeductible )     he should not be deducting the interest . Trump may be Trump the loans are business ones , and Trump IRS may be challenging that fact . If the IRS were correct , Trump could be using an interest the IRS the IRS get all Trump to help finance his campaign . This is speculative , of course , but Trump can not know for sure if Trump ’s tax plans are directly relevant to his own situation Trump until and unless we see his tax Trump . • To summarize , we know that wealthy Trump can use borrowing plus interest deductions to pay little or no taxes while living large that Trump is a major borrower , including of at least $ 160 Trump last year alone that Trump showed interest ( small pun intended ) in few details of Trump tax plan other than the child care deduction and the continued Trump deductibility for business loans that Trump ’s child care deduction would hugely benefit wealthy working parents like Trump that Trump ’s ultimate tax plan diverges from the Republican    tax policy Trump jour , mainly in its continued deduction for business loan interest that this deviation alone has a    $ 1 . 2 trillion dollar budgetary cost that his campaign seems not generally aware of this fact about Trump ’s Trump tax plan that Trump ’s disclosed tax returns from Trump show little or no tax Trump Trump claims to be under autit now and wo n’t release his tax returns Trump These facts strongly suggest an impulsive leader who never strays Trump far from his personal    in making public policy decisions , who personally likes debt and Trump it aggressively and hates paying taxes himself . Whatever else one thinks of Hillary Clinton , there is no doubt that her own taxes would rise under her own tax plan . Not so for The Hillary Clinton .
