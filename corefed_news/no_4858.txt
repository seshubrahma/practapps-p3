GEORGETOWN , DC   —    An astroturf protest campaign targeted Donald Trump ’s national security adviser Dr. Sebastian Gorka Monday , who appeared on a panel on cyber security at Georgetown University . Gorka branded the protesters " victims of fake news . "    " Eight out of ten times , I can read something written in the daily paper about an event that occurred the night before , and it is literally 180 degrees incorrect , " said Gorka in Gorka remarks to the crowded room . " It is totally contrary to what happened inside the building 80 percent of the time . That ’s something that has opened my eyes to the lack of true investigative journalism . "   In conclusion , Gorka said : What we are witnessing today —   whether it ’s RT , whether it ISIS tweets , Telegram —   none of it is new . The platforms may be new , but the concepts of propaganda , dezinformatsiya , Maskirovka , none of these are true . none of these are just being packaged in new and far more effective ways . And this administration , with our allies and partners , including Israel , intends to take it very , very seriously . Thank you .
