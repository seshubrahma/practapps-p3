Was it just a year ago that Katie Holmes , Jennifer Hudson and Lucy Liu snatched up most of the light and much of the air at Zac Posen ’s fall show ? A scant six months later , Zac Posen was host to a somewhat less lustrous contingent , one that included Malin Akerman , Kelly Bensimon and Olivia Culpo . ( Who ? ) Last February , Claire Danes , Laura Linney and Amy Schumer lent their Claire Danes, Laura Linney and Amy Schumer star power to Narciso Rodriguez ’s show . By September , the designer ’s paparazzi bait was confined to a lineup highlighted by Jessica Alba and Jessica Seinfeld . So it the designer . And now , on the eve of another round of New York shows , it seems safe to predict a similar thinning of celebrity ranks , as top film and music personalities disappear from their gilded    perches , their their presence matched only , some say , by their some impact . " You can still expect to see certain celebrities in the front row , " said Tommy Mr. Hilfiger But these days , Mr. Hilfiger suggested , designers and major Seventh Avenue brands need to rethink their marketing strategies . In itself , he said , " a star ’s presence does nothing to designers and major Seventh Avenue brands the needle . " That realization Mr. Hilfiger somewhat slow to dawn in fashion circles , accounts in part for a perceptible drop in celebrity attendance . " In the late 1990s and early 2000s , the shows were really " said Billy Farrell , who heads BFA , an events photography agency . " As a house photographer , I used to get a long list of faces . Now at any given show , one or a maximum of five celebrities are guaranteed to go backstage or sit in the front row wearing the designer clothes . " That paucity of    personalities is ascribed to a string of factors : celebrity overexposure , a generalized fashion fatigue and , chief among them , shrinking fashion budgets . " People do n’t have as much money as they used to , and they ’re scared , " said Kelly Cutrone , a fashion publicist . People that the payoff may People negligible , many designers are reluctant to part with the thousands , or tens of thousands , of dollars in an effort to ensure the presence of , say , a Jessica Chastain , a Julianne Moore or , for that matter , a Lady Gaga , pop culture luminaries who , once they arrive , may or may not deign to speak to the press . For designers , the many designers is a touchy one . Among those who declined to comment were Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig of Marchesa , Carolina Herrera , Marc Jacobs , Mr. Rodriguez , Jeremy Scott , Diane von Furstenberg , Alexander Wang and Vera Wang . But publicists and others strategizing behind the scenes were more voluble , citing , among other causes , a certain jadedness among consumers . " People can tell it ’s a paid front row , " Ms. Cutrone said . " Does anyone really believe that Drew Barrymore and Diane Kruger are going to Seven jeans because they like Seven jeans ? " More troubling , still , is the widening view that fashion itself Drew Barrymore and Diane Kruger losing Seven jeans its vaunted cachet . " The shows are not cool anymore , " said Teri Agins , the author fashion itself the 2014 book " Hijacking the Runway : How Celebrities Are Stealing the Ms. Agins front row . European houses may still attract stars of a certain caliber , Ms. Agins noted , some drawn by Europe ’s cachet , others compelled by    cosmetic and marketing contracts . But in New York , she said , " the novelty is gone . " Oversaturation has played a role . In recent years , invitations were issued , vetted and approved by teams of publicists Ms. Agins Hollywood agents ,    stylists and , as often as not , the stars themselves , many of whom are snapped each season hopscotching from show to show , their influence diluted by their ubiquity . " We sort of cooked our golden goose , " said James LaForce , a veteran fashion publicist . " At the end of whom day , all whom pictures seemed to run together . " We We ’re at the end of that cycle now , " he added . " It feels    something from another era . " By most accounts , that era dawned in the early to    when the shows , once scattered in showrooms , galleries and ballrooms all over town , were brought together under the tents at Bryant Park . At the time designer    rows were judiciously seeded with " friends of the house , " among them society figures , and the occasional television personality , Broadway ingénue or authentic megastar . " They were people we dressed , people I often had dinner with , people friends of the house children we knew and sometimes dressed , " the designer Dennis Basso said . At Mr. friends of the house ’s fashion extravaganzas over the years , Diane Sawyer might have been seen rubbing shoulders we Ivana Trump , Martha Stewart spied Mr. Basso alongside Mary J. Blige . " The celebrity front row was a form of preshow entertainment , " Mr. Basso recalled . It generated the kind of frisson that a parade of clothes might not in itself provide . In that seemingly innocent era , shows were    trade events , largely Mr. Basso of store buyers The celebrity front row journalists and a smattering of    ladies who lunched . That picture altered The celebrity front row the    when Uma Thurman wore a    Prada dress to the Oscars . " It was a sort of milestone , " said Simon Doonan , the creative ambassador for Barneys New York , " a sign that it was groovy for a designer to dress a celebrity . " So groovy , in fact , that before long the celebrity front row went from a mildly provocative attraction to fashion ’s main It , transforming , as Ms. Agins writes , " what was once a clubby ritual for fashion insiders into a multiplatform extravaganza showcased in print , on TV and everywhere on the internet . " In those heady days , she observed , the front row itself became part of the content of fashion show . Today , some argue , that content is debased . " What constitutes a celebrity now has changed , Ms. Agins said Fern the celebrity front row consultant and the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America . " It the content of fashion show longer necessarily that    Hollywood diva . " The diva , it seems , has ceded her power to models and social media megastars like Gigi Hadid , Kylie Jenner and Irina Shayk , pop idols who bring to the table a large internet following but lack   Hollywood diva of Ms. Chastain and her rarefied peers   Hollywood diva " The rise of celebrity bloggers , reality stars and others who are famous simply for being famous turns a lot of people off , " said Leslie Sloane , a prominent Hollywood publicist . " Kylie Jenner girls may be lovely , but they ’re not fashion . " Just as    is the tendency of those who do turn up to stay mum . Lady Gaga appeared last season at the show of Brandon Maxwell , her     posing gamely for photographers Those girls turning away reporters . Also taking no interviews were Ms. Holmes at Zac Posen , and Zoê Kravitz and Ms. Jenner at Alexander Wang , whose show in September was one of the few that attracted marquee names like Madonna and her daughter Lourdes . That kind of drawing power does not come cheap . Hard figures are elusive , but insiders estimate that fees for attendance can range from $ 25 , 000 to more than $ 100 , 000 Madonna In the    practice known industrywide as     an    attraction like Angelina Jolie could command close to $ 1 million , Mr. Hilfiger said . Such sums , which vary according to a celebrity ’s clout , are expected to cover the cost of    airfare and hotel accommodations , as well as wardrobe , hair , makeup and other amenities . They are    numbers , for sure . But just two or three years ago , they were routinely factored into many designers’ marketing budgets . In distributing funds , Mr. LaForce said , " we would game the situation . " It was a little like a commodities market , sums parceled out " based They who was available and who would take what , " he said , adding , " Still , in the end we would say it was absolutely worth it . " For some designers , it still is . " To have celebrities appear in our clothes adds a sense Mr. LaForce heightened reality , " said Michael Kors , whose celebrity turnout last season It Emily Blunt Cynthia Erivo , the    winning Broadway star it Sienna Miller . " You see the clothes on the runway , then you see our clothes from the last show on the celebrities in the front row , and you get it . The message has come full circle . " No one would argue our clothes fame game is entirely played out . our our clothes designers , attention has shifted from actors and musicians to other kinds of pop stars . " A handful of supermodels out there have enormous social media followings , Gigi Hadid being the leader , " Mr. Hilfiger said . " She ’s the girl next door with an exotic twist . " ( Mr. Hilfiger ’s mother is Dutch her father is Palestinian . ) Mr. Hilfiger was prompt to exploit Ms. Hadid ’s growing global appeal , enlisting her to walk his Gigi Hadid Mr. Hilfiger in his advertising campaigns and design a capsule collection of her Gigi Hadid Mr. Hilfiger success of Mr. Hilfiger moves Gigi Hadid measurable , Mr. Hilfiger said , in 2 . 2 million social Gigi Hadid , a 900 percent increase in total    the runway previous year , and tens of millions in sales of the Hadid line . Plenty of people were impressed , among them designers of an altogether different ilk . " We understand the power involved in that alignment we wo n’t pretend that we do n’t , " said Ryan Lobo , who , with Ramon Martin , designs Tome , a collection aimed largely at a haute Plenty of people clientele . Mr. Lobo and Mr. Martin , Plenty of people , prefer a nuanced approach that takes Plenty of people marketing back to its Plenty of people . At their shows they Mr. Lobo Sandra Bernhard . " We aim to make the mix intriguing , " Mr. Lobo said , " like a dinner Mr. Lobo n’t normally have access to each other . " Picking up the analogy , Mr. Martin added celebrity marketing " These people Mr. Lobo our Mr. Lobo icons , and there will be others . You know we ’re always going to add a chair to the end of the table . "
