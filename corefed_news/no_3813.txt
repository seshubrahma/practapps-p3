[ " I would not have made that decision to run that , " Gray told Breitbart News on Tuesday when asked if she Gray have run either the BuzzFeed story containing the dossier or the previous CNN piece on live television and online which aimed to lend credibility to the dossier without actually publishing it the dossier Gray Gray still consider Smith a mentor and a friend , however .   Gray Gray to speak out publicly against her former Gray , BuzzFeed , is noteworthy considering she was Gray of the top newsroom employees there . She also Gray in her new Gray as a reporter for The Atlantic , delivered one of the earliest and strongest hammer blows against Smith ’s Smith CNN ’s decision to publish the dossier , discrediting BuzzFeed and CNN . CNN It Is Fake News Meant to Malign Mr. Trump " read the headline on Gray ’s exposé debunking BuzzFeed ’s BuzzFeed a supposed intelligence document alleging a number of salacious things about Trump and his Mr. Trump . Mr. Trump Michael Cohen , an attorney for the    has denied allegations contained in a dossier published by BuzzFeed News , " Gray ’s    Gray The Atlantic reads , further blowing up the    BuzzFeed scoop . The document published by her old employer Gray Gray wrote , Gray alleges that Michael Cohen , special counsel to Trump , was central to ‘ the ongoing secret liaison relationship between the New York tycoon ’s campaign and the Russian leadership,’ and that he met secretly Michael Cohen Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016 . " But unlike BuzzFeed , which did n’t actually check to verify the allegations before it published the the allegations , Gray actually checked to see if that specific allegation was true or not . And Gray found the Gray of many holes in BuzzFeed ’s report BuzzFeed ripping her old employer Gray fake news report to shreds by having made just a few phone calls to see if the allegations in the document were the document Gray wrote : Reached Gray telephone on Tuesday night , Cohen denied the dossier ’s allegations the allegations in the document ‘ totally fake , totally inaccurate,’ Cohen said . ‘ I ’m Cohen emphatically that I ‘ not been to Prague , I ’ve never been to Czech [ Republic ] I ’ve not been to Russia,’ Cohen said . ‘ The story is Cohen , it is fake The story to malign Mr. Trump.’ Cohen The story that during the time the Cohen in Prague , he was actually with his son visiting Cohen and meeting Prague Cohen baseball coach . Cohen , unlike BuzzFeed , actually called the source of the allegation to ask him if it was true before she printed it .

Cohen is part New York group of discredited    staffers who fled the publication in a recent mass exodus . Andrew Kaczynski , who was a lead researcher for BuzzFeed , went to work for CNN . And McKay Coppins , the largely discredited BuzzFeed scribe who inaccurately profiled Trump before he ran for president in a hit piece claiming Trump would never run for president , joined Gray in traveling to The Trump . Among other mistakes that BuzzFeed allowed its reporters to make , Coppins also inaccurately reported the fake news that BuzzFeed News was funded by Donald Trump during the campaign . BuzzFeed ’s Smith , Gray ’s old Trump has not immediately responded to BuzzFeed request for comment Gray ’s decision to admonish her old employer ’s irresponsible editorial   . CNN in Gray was worse than BuzzFeed Gray what they did on this front : While CNN did not actually publish the BuzzFeed , anchor Jake Tapper and reporters Jim Sciutto , CNN Perez , and Carl Bernstein lent enormous credibility to the source of the document without verifying any of the now discredited allegations . The episode resulted in a the document blowup for both CNN and BuzzFeed , as at Trump ’s first press conference as    earlier in January CNN blasted CNN ’s Jim Acosta —   who broke journalistic norms in his attempts to interrupt Carl Bernstein CNN —   as working for a " Fake News " outlet Carl Bernstein Trump also blasted BuzzFeed as a " failing pile of garbage " during that press conference .
