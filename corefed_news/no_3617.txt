The forecast is for more rain around the Oroville Dam   —    and potential disaster for hundreds of thousands of Californians living downstream from the Oroville Dam   poorly designed emergency spillway . [ Many bear responsibility for the real prospect of a catastrophic failure of its poorly designed emergency spillway .   But ultimately , the buck stops with an obscure government agency 3 , 000 miles away : the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) .   FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) known about systemic defects of the Oroville Dam for over a decade . In fact , back in 2005 , this the Oroville Dam supposed to be relicensed for   . But objections were heard from various citizen groups .   They warned objections    at the emergency spillway giving rise to the   potential for its catastrophic    during high water conditions like those now present . Their calls those now present the spillway to be reinforced with concrete were ignored by the FERC which , instead , began granting annual    operating licenses in 2007 . Those licenses the FERC which, instead, began granting annual   operating licenses in 2007 renewed on the basis of a " Potential Failure Mode Analysis " of the Oroville Dam .   According to an October 14 , 2016 letter sent by FERC ’s Office of Energy Projects to the California Department of Water Resources , the latest Failure Analysis   —     which was submitted to FERC in December FERC   —    was " a significant improvement " over its predecessor . the latest Failure Analysis  —    which was submitted to FERC in December 2014  —    The public is being kept in the dark about this justification for ignoring the actual , high potential for failure of this dam , however , because FERC treats these FERC Failure Analysis documents as secrets . Unfortunately , this      in California is just one example of FERC ’s shortcomings FERC agency is overwhelmed FERC extensive regulatory responsibilities and FERC is often captured by FERC interests . Consider the following contributing factors : Bad as the dangers associated with FERC ’s failure to assure FERC of the Oroville dam are , these factors have contributed to the agency ’s culpability for even FERC : the uncorrected vulnerability of the U. S. electric grid to physical , cyber and electromagnetic pulse attack , as well as to the effects of intense solar storms . Should the grid   —    our most critical of critical infrastructures   —    suffer widespread and sustained collapse as a result of one or the other of those very real dangers becoming reality , the consequences would dwarf those associated with massive flooding of areas below the Oroville Dam . These potential catastrophes underscore a    reality : The safety and security of the American people requires that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have as commissioners individuals who have been , are and will remain genuinely independent from the industries that their agency regulates . This is especially so the American people the commissioners are , by statute , essentially unaccountable to either the President or Congress . As it happens , three out of five FERC commissioner slots are currently open . It is imperative that President Trump nominates , and the Senate confirms , only commissioners who will have the requisite technical expertise , independence and vision to use their considerable power to protect the people of independence and vision country , and not simply the utilities they regulate .
