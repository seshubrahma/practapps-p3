Pat Caddell spoke to Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Thursday morning about Wednesday night ’s     Forum on NBC , saying , " I do n’t think she has a narrative to capitalize on , other than , ‘ Trump is dangerous , unfit to be   ’ which is hard to make when you ’re not showing that you ’re in total command yourself , " said Pat Caddell . [ Pat Caddell also said :   I thought as I watched it , I thought , every time she [ Hillary Clinton ] ca n’t answer a question —   which is almost every time —   in one sentence or two , she rambles on , and you can tell she ’s lying , she ’s lying , she ’s lying . Whether it has to do with knowing the facts or not , it ’s just what comes across as she ’s trying to make things up and throw things in . " she was on the defensive last night , " Caddell said , continuing : she was hit by all sides by different points of the audience , who were very polite to she . Even the man who suggested Even the man who suggested he would be in prison for doing what she did  —   the first question out of the box would be in prison for doing what she did   —    the first question out of the box . But everything was , " I was wrong and so was Donald Trump , and Donald Trump has n’t taken responsibility . " Caddell stated , " By the way , the new argument that ‘ I used a classified server for classified documents,’ where the hell did that come from ? I mean , that was just out of left field . " He went on to say , " I was on my heels listening : ‘ Oh , my gosh , what are you talking about?’ She keeps going back to the same lies , and She gets away with it because Lauer does n’t follow up . " " She looked defensive and sounded defensive , and the mainstream media is just flipping out because the mainstream media do n’t know what to do , " Caddell concluded .
