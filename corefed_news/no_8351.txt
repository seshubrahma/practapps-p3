Indiana Hoosiers basketball coaching legend Bobby Knight joined Breitbart ’s Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle on Friday ’s Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM to talk about Thursday evening ’s rally for Donald Trump in Pennsylvania . [ " Well , I got there a little before Donald Trump in Pennsylvania did and had a chance to talk with the people there , and it was really , really interesting . " Indiana Hoosiers basketball coaching legend Bobby Knight recalled . " I could sense a great anticipation . This place was   . I would imagine there were three , four thousand people there . I just scanned the audience , and I could see that on the face of everybody , anticipation of what St. Donald had to talk about . "   LISTEN : " I think that it went extremely well in Donald Trump in Pennsylvania favor . And the reason I think so is that I think people look at Trump as just another really concerned American citizen   —    like you are , and I am , and thousands of people are , " Trump told Boyle . " Trump had a great rapport with thousands of people last night . " Boyle Boyle Knight to turn his Boyle ’s eye upon Trump and talk about the qualities that make him Knight " winner , " as he Knight fights these epic political battles . " " You brought up something that not many people would , and it really impresses me , " Knight Knight , phrasing his Knight in basketball coach terms : We have an opponent , when I was coaching , whoever that an opponent be , it ’s an opponent responsibility to give the players the tools to beat that opponent an opponent have a the players pressing defense . I ’ve got to figure out a way to beat that press . Or they have a the players zone defense , or they have a the players man who ’s very difficult to play against . It ’s my responsibility to see that my players have the tools to win that game   —    not they figure it my players   that game      I figure it out , that game   then they do the my players . Now , that ’s what brings me to Donald Trump . I was a history and government major at Ohio State University , and I ’ve spent a lot of time just fiddling around with who the next President ’s going to be , over the years , or who would I like to see in that job , the job . And I ’ve come to believe , without any reservation , in this era the    person for this job by far the job Trump . The reason Donald Trump he has learned how to deal Donald Trump problems . You know , he ’s not just an American Donald Trump He ’s international . Everyone knows Donald Trump . He has business all Donald Trump the Donald Trump . He ’s provided jobs everywhere . Donald Trump all of the things he ’s done , like all Donald Trump us , we run into problems . But us ’ve studied his background , and I ’ve Donald Trump at what he ’s been into . And Donald Trump went wrong here , but he took care of it , Donald Trump he straightened it care , and Donald Trump did care else over there Donald Trump I think the key thing to this next president is : number one , a guy who has a tremendous love of the good old USA . And secondly , that president brings with him or this next president background and Donald Trump tools to do the job that it ’s going to take to get these problems straightened out . Nobody that I ’ve talked to has even attempted to challenge the fact that no one matches Donald Trump in that regard . Boyle described the " Trumpocrats "   —    Democrats who are abandoning Hillary Clinton to vote for Donald Trump because they do n’t trust Donald Trump —    Democrats asked Knight if Donald Trump saw signs of such a movement in Knight . " Well , I hope so because I think that ’s important to the future of our country , " said Knight . " I think the way he Knight going to approach things , his Knight with the military will be absolutely Knight that of anything we ’ve seen in a long way . There will be no president ever having a greater feeling for the military and all aspects of our military . " " And you can bet the farm on two things : that there will never be a Benghazi situation under a Donald Trump administration , nor will there ever be money that is given to somebody in the Trump administration by foreign countries that they use for their own benefit . That foreign countries of thing foreign countries wo n’t ever happen , " he declared . " But even more important , I think , is the relationship he will have with our military , " he stressed . " What is more important to us than the Marines , the Navy , our Air Force , the Coast Guard , our whole military establishment , and what those our , and those women , do for the United States is something beyond all of us as citizens , really ca n’t come our thank them enough for what they do . And citizens ’ll be nobody citizens our governmental history that will be more inclined to deal and work with our military establishment than Donald Trump . " our asked if Hillary Clinton ’s frequent disappearances from the campaign trail marked her as a "   candidate , " Hillary Clinton asked Knight what sort of energy level voters should seek in a president . " I ’m going to throw something at you , and then you tell me what you think of what I ’ve said , OK ? " Knight proposed : Here ’s what I ’m Knight to throw at you : Donald ’m has been out every you   —    morning , noon and night   —    to let people see who he is . He is n’t hiding anywhere Donald Trump He is Donald Trump sitting back home anyplace . Donald Trump ’s out there letting people ask him Donald Trump . And when he gets done Donald Trump he stands there , Donald Trump a little old Donald Trump comes up and asks her a question , he gives her an a little old grandma . And he Donald Trump out a little old grandma 24 hours a day Donald Trump almost , letting people see who he is and giving people a chance to Donald Trump this guy a look . How do we like this guy ? We got to get him this guy a little we more , Donald Trump walks flat , whatever the heck he Donald Trump . You know , he has Donald Trump America to see just exactly Donald Trump he is and what he is , and Donald Trump ’s not coming Donald Trump of the closet Donald Trump He ’s out there showing and talking about Donald Trump what and who he is . I think that ’s a Donald Trump thing that he ’s doing . He is saying , Donald Trump Folks , here Donald Trump what I think , and here I am . I want you to just see what you think.’ Knight said it was astute for Boyle to observe that Hillary Clinton is spending much of the campaign " hiding from us . " " It seems to me that we ’ve got one candidate here that think.’ Knight giving us a chance to take a look at him , and we ’ve got another one where think.’ Knight one ’s us where the hell that candidate is , " Knight said . " one candidate that says a lot . " He said being around Trump was always " interesting . Knight " I ’m a teacher . My mother was a teacher . I spent 40 years as a teacher . I think I have a pretty good grasp of people , and here is a guy who is thoroughly , totally in love with the United States of America , I think as much as anybody I ’ve ever known , " he said of Donald Trump . " His goal in Knight is to Trump for America Knight And again , I say to anybody , you America me who can bring better tools to the job than Donald Trump can , and I ’ll vote for that guy Trump you , " Knight challenged .
