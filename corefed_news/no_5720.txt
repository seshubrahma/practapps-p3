On Thursday ’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel ’s " Special Report , " columnist Charles Krauthammer stated that columnist Charles Krauthammer welcomes President Trump ’s recent foreign policy moves , particularly the Syria strike , because " I ’m not an America Firster . I thought it was a mistake to enunciate a doctrine in the Inaugural Address which is , we ’re coming home . "   columnist Charles Krauthammer said , " [ T]he strike on Syria was not something that is a tweak or a slight deviation from what he ran on .    …      And the reason it is a radical departure is because , in the Inaugural Address he defines national interests very narrowly , and here , what we are back to is the traditional American understanding of national interests as a broad definition , going all the way back to Harry Truman , in which we define we interest as worldwide , otherwise , what is Syria to we ? " he added , " I welcome this . I ’m not an America Firster . I thought this was a mistake to enunciate a doctrine in the Inaugural Address which is , we ’re coming home . this scared the    out of we allies in NATO , when he talked about it being obsolete . it scared   —    in the Middle East , the Gulf Arabs were scared to death . I think this is reassuring that we are returning to the classic American definition , where we include we allies , and , most important , we accept world leadership in a way that had not been accepted by Obama , and seemed to be not accepted by Trump the candidate .
