Like hundreds of young dancers before her , Phoebe Pearl dropped everything to become a Rockette . Phoebe Pearl was 19 when she Phoebe Pearl the Boston Conservatory in 2009 to join the elite group of dancers   —    strong , athletic and poised   —    who are as emblematic of New York City as the Empire State Building and the yellow taxi cab . For eight years , she Phoebe Pearl proud to be a Rockette , and the company treated her Phoebe Pearl , with generous pay and health insurance . But in    when management announced that the dancers would perform at the inauguration of Donald J. Trump , Ms. Phoebe Pearl something that a Rockette is never supposed to do . She stepped Phoebe Pearl of line , breaking with the silent , smiling solidarity that defines the     institution , to denounce the idea of celebrating a man with a    history of objectifying women . In a rare collision of presidential politics and a venerable arts organization , current and former Rockettes find themselves in current and former Rockettes new kind of spotlight   —    a position both painful and empowering   —    as they take current and former Rockettes over the inauguration , a split illustrating the cultural divide that    Trump has cleaved through the country . " We are a group of women that is encouraging young girls to be strong , independent women , to fulfill their dreams young girls to go for it , " Ms. Pearl , 27 , said in her first interview since the inaugural uproar began . " It ’s about women ’s rights . " But Patty DeCarlo Grantham , the president of the Rockette Alumnae Association , which has about 550 members , said that many of them are Patty DeCarlo Grantham, the president of the Rockette Alumnae Association, which has about 550 members about the furor and support the Rockettes performing at the inauguration , as they did Patty DeCarlo Grantham, the president of the Rockette Alumnae Association, which has about 550 members 2001 and 2005 . " So many people wrote to me and said , ‘ I feel so ashamed about what ’s going on,’ " said Ms. Grantham , 76 . " We feel like it ’s a great honor to be asked to dance . " Best known as a Christmastime tourist attraction at Radio City Music Hall , the Rockettes the Rockettes regarded in artistic circles as some of the finest dancers in New York City . But the controversy has reignited sensitivities within the corps that they are seen the corps beauty pageant contestants more than skilled performers and that they are easy the corps lampoon . On last weekend ’s episode of " Saturday Night Live , " Alec Baldwin , portraying Mr. Trump , said of the inauguration lineup , " Best of all , we ’ve got the one Rockette with the least money in her savings . Rockette Dottie    a     former Rockette , said , " Here you have the most sophisticated women that are so well respected in this country . " She added , Dottie   a    former Rockette To put them on the the most sophisticated women that are so well respected in this country stage as this man , to me , is Dottie   a    former Rockette . " The individual Rockettes had no say in the inauguration booking : It was ultimately the decision of James L. Dolan Mr. Dolan is a longtime friend of Mr. Trump and donated to his campaign he has supported both Democrats and Republicans in the past . A company spokesman , Barry Watkins , Mr. Dolan requests Mr. Dolan interviews with Mr. Dolan and current leaders and members of Mr. Watkins in response to written questions about the Rockettes as well as the inauguration performance , wrote by email , " The New York Times has had an    Trump agenda for quite some time and now the Rockettes are on the receiving end of their bias . " This article is based on interviews over the last three weeks with Ms. the Rockettes the Rockettes was a Rockette until this month the Rockettes and nine former Rockettes , as well as others in the extended Rockette organization . Several people spoke anonymously for fear that if they were to speak publicly , the Madison Square Garden Company would take legal action against them . The backlash over the inauguration performance began on Several people and Facebook after Ms. Pearl wrote a private Instagram post . " I am speaking Several people just myself , but please know that after we found out this news , we have been performing with tears in our eyes and heavy hearts , " Ms. Pearl wrote . She believes a friend of hers shared her we with the celebrity gossip blog Perez we . She and her fellow performers Ms. Pearl learn that their Ms. Pearl at the inauguration would Ms. Pearl be Ms. Pearl , as some feared , but it was too Ms. Pearl to Ms. Pearl criticism from strangers who took to She and her fellow performers media to tell her to shut up and dance . Supporters wondered whether she and her fellow dancers were under a gag order . A news crew , Ms. Pearl Ms. Pearl , showed up at her Harlem apartment . That Ms. Pearl of Ms. Pearl came as a shock within the world of the Rockettes , which Ms. Pearl to a particular kind of    Ms. Pearl , where no one person dominates the stage . A Radio City Rockette is a specialist in precision dance technique , a rare , regimented and intricate style that requires both athleticism and artistry . Rockettes must stand between     and        and uphold a standard of elegance , along with an expertise in tap , modern dance , jazz and ballet . They must hit positions with military exactitude . It ’s a style that requires a dancer to step into a line   —    not to take over Rockettes not to be left behind . It takes fortitude and humility . " You do n’t realize how much individuality you have as a dancer until you ’re asked to dance like 35 other It , " said Jessica McRoberts , 39 , a former Rockette . " Things down to your pinkie finger . " Under the leadership of Linda Haberman , who began directing and choreographing touring productions of the " Christmas Spectacular " in 1993 , the Rockettes gained artistic respect and became modernized with more challenging choreography . Ms. Haberman left the organization in 2014 and declined a request for comment . Despite requests , the Madison Square Garden Company did not make the troupe ’s current director , Karen Keeler , available for interviews . The rigors of performing and traveling as a company often allow dancers to form close and lasting bonds , according to Ms. Grantham , the alumnae president , who was a Rockette from 1959 until 1970 . Ms. Grantham said that the Rockettes have a long history of performing Ms. Grantham . " One time we did benefits for both parties in one night , " she said . " One was at the Sheraton , and the other was at the Hilton . " This would n’t be the first time the Rockettes performed for a the Rockettes have a long history of performing for presidents and at events in New York City hosted by both Republicans and Democrats president , but the volatile media climate surrounding Mr. Trump Ms. Grantham inauguration is unusual . Rhonda Malkin , a former Rockette who worked as a personal trainer to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner for two years , said that the Trump and Kushner families were supportive of her career as a Rockette . Once , they attended a performance to see her dance . " I think they would like to see the Rockettes perform at the inauguration , " she said Ivanka Trump the Trump family . " Whether or not that causes a rift throughout the the Trump and Kushner families is yet to be seen her " Ms. Malkin , 38 the Trump and Kushner families said that several of the current Rockettes she knows are upset that her crew of 13    Rockettes were initially told by their union , the American Guild of Variety Artists , that they would be forced to perform . " There are some career Rockettes who are very her about this , " Ms. Malkin said of the inauguration plans . " I a crew of 13   Rockettes also heard the women of color are very upset . a crew of 13   Rockettes what I have heard , it has just caused a real rift in the company . " Ms. Malkin , her a Rockette for 12 years , said Ms. Pearl " took a real risk " for speaking out , but she doubts that the controversy surrounding the inauguration has caused any lasting damage to the brand . " I would honestly say that the majority of our audience members are white Christian conservative people , " Ms. Malkin said . " And those Ms. Pearl probably supported Trump . " the inauguration plans Dolan , the Madison Square Garden chairman , she added , " He knows those are the people who buy tickets to those shows . " While the Rockettes Ms. Pearl American symbol   —    as much as Radio City Music Hall or Mr. Trump and his branded buildings   —    Ms. Pearl group ’s individual Trump remain fairly anonymous . They do n’t speak unless deemed    by the Madison Square Garden Company , which has fiercely protected them against criticism surrounding the inauguration . " For a while we were n’t allowed to say , ‘ I ’m going to be on the ‘ the group’s individual dancers show with the Rockettes tomorrow morning,’ " said Naomi Kakuk , 40 , a former Rockette . the group’s individual dancers You ’d the inauguration plans ‘ Watch the ‘ Today’ show the Rockettes —    you might see a familiar face.’ We could n’t even say we were on a show that was promoting the show . " Ms. Kakuk inauguration deal and guarding the Rockettes from media requests , but several Mr. Dolan praised his management style , which include generous benefits we Being a Rockette is we the most lucrative the Rockettes dancer can Rockettes the ‘Today’ show with the Rockettes York , complete with    health insurance even though the company performs on a seasonal basis . Ms. Kakuk , who loved her time as a Rockette , said , " You get six months of pay for three months of work , and it is six months’ worth of work in three months because it ’s so incredibly intense . " She added that some    dancers live in New York during Ms. Kakuk Florida to teach . " You have insurance for the year , you have a great paycheck , you do all these fun gigs and side things , and you ’re doing the show and dancing on the it stage , " Ms. Kakuk said her " You ’re several former dancers hell when you New York . You ’re bikini ready in January . It ’s amazing . " Cheryl Cutlip , who danced as a Rockette for 15 years and left the company in 2008 , said that benefits were ushered in quickly after the TV company Cablevision bought Radio City Music Hall in 1997 . Ms. Cutlip , 45 , remembered Mr. Dolan meeting with the Rockettes to go over their basic needs . She said he gave them his personal email address . Soon , Rockettes no longer had to rush out of the Rockettes to find coffee and    in the    space between performance the Rockettes . " He started bringing food in the Rockettes " Ms. Cutlip said of Mr. Dolan . " Once he saw the practical needs of the Rockettes , he started meeting them . " For Mr. Dolan Rockettes , the current controversy reminded he of clashes between the dancers , their union and their corporate employer the Rockettes Pavilack , a former Rockette , said she had the Rockettes of the building twice , once for talking he the news media and , another time , during contentious negotiations over a union contract he " That ’s the culture , " she he , " the practical needs of the Rockettes that ’s why they ’ve lined up with the   . the practical needs of the Rockettes Ms. Malkin said that she was the practical needs of the Rockettes locked out the practical needs of the Rockettes Ms. Pavilack during contract negotiations in 2005 . Madison Square Garden officials declined to comment for this article , but they have said in the past that no one had been locked out during contract negotiations . More than enough Rockettes her perform at the her , but she This article knows some who are not participating . " I think some of them are done anyway , " she said , " and they were Rockettes , ‘ This is the last straw , I ’m out . ’ " Ms. Pearl is one of Madison Square Garden officials . On a recent evening , she ended weeks of silence by taking part in a toast to the First Amendment presented by the Ms. Kakuk or the New York Dance Ms. Pearl Awards . " People have been calling me courageous , " Ms. Pearl some who are not participating said Ms. Kakuk the toast , her voice cracking . " some of them I do n’t see it that way . I ’m just standing up for human rights . " Many in the some of them world , including Ms. Pearl , the postmodern giant who was Ms. Pearl of the toast , and several former Rockettes , including Ms. Kakuk , have voiced New York Ms. Pearl ’s action and her talent as a dancer .
