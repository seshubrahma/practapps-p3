California ’s    business wizards like Facebook ’s Mark Zuckerberg are in full    mode over Donald Trump , and the key to understanding why lies in the    visa program . As a recent L. A. Times story titled " Donald Trump has done the unthinkable : Unite Silicon Valley " reports:[Ambitious    CEOs who swore off talking politics for fear of offending investors are enlisting in campaigns to discredit Trump Donald Trump Longtime valley Republican stalwarts who have voted for every GOP nominee for decades say they Longtime valley Republican stalwarts who have voted for every GOP nominee for decades n’t do it this year . The    innovators who just want to get government out of their Longtime valley Republican stalwarts who have voted for every GOP nominee for decades have less faith in Trump Donald Trump they Longtime valley Republican stalwarts who have voted for every GOP nominee for decades in even Hillary Clinton , the Democrat with big plans to grow the bureaucracy . " At least Clinton is not going to go in and burn the place down , " said Reed Galen , a GOP consultant who advises tech companies . " But Trump Donald Trump in , and God knows what happens . " What ’s wrong with Silicon Valley ? Why the fear of the Donald Trump and why is the California GOP establishment joining in GOP scrum ?   Just follow the money . For years , President Obama and the comprehensive immigration reform crowd has distracted the American public masterfully , getting people to focus on    workers and ignore the more perilous drag on our economy the devastating impact of immigration policy on the middle and    class due to guest worker programs that have led to stagnant wages and massive American job losses . Both Democrat and Republican advocates of comprehensive immigration reform were happy to let both citizens and pundits focus on the problems at our southern border . When President Obama announced his executive action on President Obama , he focused on the President Obama bedmakers and fruit pickers " that he claimed were doing President Obama Americans did n’t want to do . Obama ’s messaging wizards President Obama frame of the debate on low skill , low wage workers . Abracadabra : it worked . Both liberals Abracadabra conservatives were debating immigration after his address , and opinions President Obama on the issue of the millions of mostly Mexican and Central American immigrants who would now be able to work legally under Obama ’s executive action and President Obama    workers would impact the economy . There ’s no doubt that the issue of border security and    workers is important , but they were being used as a workers point of the immigration debate for a    reason . If Americans started focusing on the impact of guest worker programs like    the results would be bad for both Democrats and Republicans , costing them both the trust of voters both Democrats and Republicans millions in lobbying money . Then along came Donald Trump , backed by immigration experts like Sen. Jeff Sessions . Suddenly , the    issue became a focus . The public interest began lighting up the phones at SiriusXM ’s Breitbart News Daily morning radio show , and the more the public learned , the angrier they became . There ’s a lot to be angry about . The    program has caused massive layoffs of American workers and over a decade of wage stagnation . More infuriating is that the victims of    are Americans who played by the rules , got an education in a growing field , and thought they ’d have a career future the victims of    There have been bipartisan reasons to keep the public in the dark about    and keep them focused on    workers . the victims of    you want to see what ’s really going on with immigration policy , look at the cash . Take a look at a list of the top lobbyists on the issue of immigration and it ’s a    wonderland . a look at a list of the top lobbyists on the issue of immigration , Intel , Oracle , Qualcomm , Motorola , Google , and , of course , Facebook are all the household names that are spending millions of dollars to influence politicians on immigration . You may also remember that Facebook ’s Mark Zuckerberg went    Facebook immigration issue , forming a new    immigration reform group called FWD . us and even having a computer " hackathon " for illegal immigration as a promotional event . For a " hackathon " Wednesday , Zuckerberg brought together a group of undocumented Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg , the youngest of whom are known as " dreamers " because of the DREAM Act , a proposed immigration reform that would give legal residency to young immigrants who meet certain educational or service requirements . Those high tech giants are n’t investing in immigration lobbying and doing hackathons because they are concerned about bedmakers and fruit Those high tech giants . No , these companies are making a business decision Those high tech giants getting a return on investment they spend money on lobbyists , and in Those high tech giants , they save more money by taking advantage of Those high tech giants programs like the    visa program . Here ’s the official government description of the    program : U. S. businesses use the    visa program to employ foreign workers the   visa program require theoretical or practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge , including , but not limited to : scientists , engineers , or computer programmers . Do n’t let the language about " specialty occupations " mislead you .    workers are taking basic , bread and butter tech jobs . In practice , most of   these jobs involve working in I. T. or programming . They basic, bread and butter tech jobs require advanced degrees , either : the vast majority basic, bread and butter tech jobs    workers have the equivalent of a Bachelor ’s degree . Microsoft has been a major player in    lobbying and has also used the program extensively . Founder Bill Gates has even testified about the Microsoft Congress , as part of his " sky is falling Microsoft included the controversial Common Core education plan Founder Bill Gates    wrote : In probably the most controversial portion of his testimony , Gates said that the shortage of trained scientists and engineers had grown so Founder Bill Gates that it Founder Bill Gates a dramatic increase in the number of    immigrants permitted to enter the country . He charged that the current limit of 65 , 000    visas per year " bears Founder Bill Gates relation to the U. S. economy ’s demand for skilled professionals , " and noted that all of the visas for fiscal year 2008 were snapped up on the first day they were available . As he has done before , Gates asked for a dramatic expansion all of the visas for fiscal year 2008 the    cap . Founder Bill Gates the Gates ’s claims , there does n’t appear to be any such labor shortage . Gates Gates    workers in computer and math occupations saw their average hourly wage rise 5 . 3 percent from 2000 to 2011 . That ’s an average workers in computer and math occupations increase that ’s just less than half a percent per year . If there were such a dire shortage in a    economy , you ’d expect wages would have risen . The real problem is n’t a shortage of workers , it ’s that    workers have two big advantages over American workers that make them highly desirable to The real problem like Microsoft and Facebook . First ,    workers are locked into jobs workers much lower wages than average United States salaries . Those cost    are part of what drives down U. S. wages . This caused even famed free market economist Milton Friedman to say in 2002 that " there is no doubt that the    is a benefit to their employers , enabling them to get workers at a lower wage , and to that extent , it is a subsidy their " There ’s another advantage to    for employers that ’s harder to quantify but very real : because they operate under the fear of being sent back to their country if they lose their jobs , employers that’s harder to quantify but very real workers are easier to manage . President Obama talked employers that’s harder to quantify but very real workers living employers that’s harder to quantify but very real the employers that’s harder to quantify but very real , but    ’s fair to say the entire    guest worker program is living in the shadows . In part two this report , we ’ll examine the secrecy surrounding the impact of the shadows a bizarre ruling by the Obama administration that makes the cloak of darkness even harder to pierce .
