’   ’ "    It was supposed to be Independent Journal Review ’s week to shine . " "    The upstart ,    news website , which has emerged    as a favorite of President Donald Trump ’s administration for       conservative bent ,   to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as he traveled to    Asia for he first trip there as the nation ’s top diplomat . " "    Media critics were wary of the Trump administration ’s decision to     in favor    of a sole reporter   —    from IJR , no less , a friendly news outlet .    The website had already been scorned for using The website newfound White    House access to publish what were seen as glowing pieces about    the Trump administration’s . " "    The opportunity to shadow Tillerson did little to change that    perception    IJR reporter McPike filing stories from the road during the week . Nor was she    sending    updates to colleagues about the secretary ’s       . McPike    her superiors in a   saying they    told her to focus McPike solely on a profile piece   —    McPike decision that was reversed later    under mounting pressure and allowed her to break some news about    his trip and views toward McPike media . " "       at home , another firestorm erupted when IJR ’s viral editor ,    Kyle Becker , published a conspiracy theory about former President    Barack Obama . Without evidence , Becker suggested that perhaps    there was a connection between Obama ’s   Kyle Becker to Hawaii and a    ruling by a federal former President   Barack Obama that blocked Trump ’s revised    travel ban . " "    Reporters took notice and ridiculed the baseless report . IJR ’s    congressional reporter , Joe Perticone , . And IJR was forced to retract the    report . " ’    In IJR email obtained by Business the baseless report apologized to    his colleagues for " showing a lack of judgment . " However , while    Becker took the fall , he was not the only person to blame , a Becker person familiar with the   Becker told Business Insider . ’ "    IJR ’s chief content officer , Benny Johnson , Business Insider warned    earlier that the story about Obama was an unfounded conspiracy    theory , but he assigned it to Becker anyway , this person said . "       Alex Skatell    the founder of IJR , told    in a    statement that the incident was under investigation . He said    Business Insider Johnson , and content    Becca Lower had been    suspended : ’ Becker    In conversations with more than a dozen current and former    employees    most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity ,    several people said the incidents were emblematic of larger    problems at IJR . Current and former staffers said the website ,    chasing clicks , had    sharply to the right in recent months    to feed its conservative base the red meat it desired . ’ "    Additionally , these    characterized Johnson    who declined    to comment its conservative base this story , as a verbally abusive leader who had    flagrantly violated the website ’s ethics guidelines   —    only to be    promoted up the chain . The work environment , they said , has    resulted in a swath of talent recently leaving the website for    work Johnson, who declined   to comment for this story, as a verbally abusive leader who had   flagrantly violated the website’s ethics guidelines  —   only to be   promoted up the chain . " ’    IJR was founded in 2013 by Skatell , a former Republican         in the field of communications . The website is a    property under an umbrella organization , the Media Group of    America , the website includes IMGE , a Republican consulting firm . ’ ’    From the beginning , IJR has held a key advantage : access to a    large , highly engaged Facebook audience with a IJR interest in    politics . ’ ’    Skatell , ahead of the curve years ago , started a string of    Facebook pages aimed at attracting people passionate about    certain subject matters . Perhaps the largest was Conservative    Daily , which quickly amassed followers . ( It currently boasts more    than 7 million followers . ) ’ ’   ’ "    IJR used the page as a springboard . In its infancy   —    and still    today   —    the outlet posted its content to its It Facebook    page but relied heavily on Skatell ’s Conservative Daily page for    It of its It . " ’    At a time when clickbait reigned on Facebook , IJR found great       in packaging conservative news stories with sensational    headlines , then posting them to its      Facebook page with a large partisan audience . ’ "    The strategy catapulted the great   success in packaging conservative news stories with sensational   headlines past IJR media    organizations to become a top    news destination . In    January 2015 , Disrupter Capital   in Media Group of    America to help fuel the website ’s growth . Soon after , Skatell    sought to boost IJR ’s credibility as a news the website of    the 2016 election by making a slew of hires . " ’    First was Johnson , who came aboard in early 2015 as its creative    content director . Michelle Jaconi joined the team a few months    later from CNN , taking the role of executive editor with the aim    of working alongside founding     Bubba Atkinson , to    streamline operations . Justin Green was brought on board from the    Washington Examiner as politics editor , Hunter    from The    Washington Post as a national political reporter , and Kate    Bennett from Politico as White House correspondent . ’ ’    The young team put a unique spin on its news coverage , and by the    summer of 2015 , the site had made a splash in the The young team of viral    politics partly by filming videos with several presidential    candidates . South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham , for instance ,     amassing    more than 2 million views . Texas Sen. Ted Cruz   which raked in more    than 1 . 5 million views . ’ ’    " It was a startup atmosphere , " said one former employee . " At peak    IJR , it was an exciting place to work . It really felt like we    were building something that didn’’t exist . We were experimenting    and trying new it . " ’ ’    The investment in news seemed to slowly we off in    of    earning respect from the ’ ’    . In February    2016 , IJR made a sizable leap into    mainstream , hosting a GOP    primary debate with ABC News . ’ ’    While the website bolstered its news staff and moved to    professionalize operations , it struggled to wean itself from its    partisan roots . Cracks the website the newsroom began to emerge . ’ ’    the website content team , the website from the website news team and mostly made up    of remote writers and bloggers ’ ’    churn out aggregated    partisan content , aiming to feed what DC staffers , according to    sources , had dubbed " the redneck army . " IJR’ ’s most loyal readers ,    sources said , weren’’t as interested in serious ,        pieces written by the news staff in DC , who    were sometimes    to by the remote writers as the " elitist "    members of IJR . ’ ’    " You kind of have these two sides to it , " one former staffer    said . " There’ ’s the public side of who they claim to be : ’’ We are a    place where you can experience the news . ’’    …      And then There’ have    this other side that is a lot more   . " ’ "    The pressure to package stories in a way more palatable to the    tastes of the website The website audience was even felt by    some members of the news team who in the early days were beholden    to weekly quotas of upwards of 500 , 000 clicks , according to two the news team The attitude is a familiar one for many sites focused on    the    hyperpartisan nature of political news , as    they hold their writers to traffic goals and struggle to find a    balance between telling the news and satisfying their audiences . " ’    " I felt they of a lot of the stuff that I had to publish    there , " said one they staffer . " There’ ’s stuff that I had to    write at IJR that I wouldn’’t want my professors to read . Not    because it was authored in There’ bad way , but the way    IJR    covering stories and issues was an embarrassment to political    reporting    "    ’    The stories produced by the news team , however ,    to much    higher standards compared with those from the    team ,    sources said . The two sides the news team heads . ’ ’    " There kind of came a point where we were like , ’’ What    we ? ’’ "    one person said . " Are we this    independent news    organization , or are we just feeding the    beast ? " we "    In one particularly contentious incident , Bennett , we site ’s    White House correspondent , confronted Becker about a post he had    written that contained several questionable tweets about Obama . White House Becker and hurled insults Becker Bennett in response , two    people said . " Obama    Becker She was in tears , " one person Kate   Bennett from Politico as White House correspondent . ’ "    Multiple sources said Atkinson , then the site ’s editor in chief ,    was the glue that held the two camps together . Commanding the    respect of each side , he had been working to move the content    toward the center , they said . " ’    " Bubba was steering it toward more in the middle of Atkinson, then the site’s editor in chief,    road . Not    this crazy conservative    " said one person Atkinson, then the site’s editor in chief,    " And I think    we were really      close . We almost got there . The clicks   —      the money probably was a deciding factor in why things didn’’t end       eventually getting there . ’ ’ we " He spent years fighting Alex to try to get this thing in a place    where we were respected , " this person added . " At the end of Bubba    day , he grew tired . He got to the point to where his we of    life was not good . He was fighting every day . He just got worn Bubba out . " Bubba "    Atkinson departed IJR for Bubba news website Axios in November ,    leaving Bubba power vacuum that eventually led Bubba the outlet ’s      roots being emboldened and IJR control , current    and former staffers told Business Insider . " ’    " Bubba was sort of the person that kept the normalcy and the    guard up , " one person said . " Once that happened , people were just    Bubba off their leashes . " ’ ’ ’ "    Johnson , the     DC internet personality who was     seized power after Atkinson ’s departure . He was promoted earlier people this year to his current position , chief content officer . " "    But Johnson ’s rise inside the company Atkinson come without    Atkinson . Skatell ’s move to empower Johnson Atkinson IJR    staffers for a host of reasons , many of Atkinson said Skatell’s Skatell       had doubts about his ethics    professional behavior , IJR leadership style Atkinson and vision for the website ’s editorial    direction . " "    IJR   staffers for a host of reasons major concern , sources    Staffers was Johnson ’s    of    plagiarism . In    2015 , new allegations were leveled against    Johnson by his colleagues , multiple people familiar with the    matter said . " Atkinson These people said Johnson’    colleagues had accused him of    plagiarizing part of an Atkinson Atkinson Cathy Atkinson    Rodgers . The article cited " GOP sources " who said she was a multiple people familiar with the   matter candidate to succeed John Boehner Atkinson House speaker .    Johnson had lifted a portion of the Washington state    representative’ ’s an article about Rep. Cathy McMorris   Rodgers the story , the sources said . ’ "    The content in question was discovered and scrubbed after the Atkinson story had been published , a person familiar with the matter said .    A vague editor ’s note "GOP sources" who said she was a   possible candidate to succeed John Boehner as House speaker bottom said the story had been    updated . " ’    The incident was brought to the attention of Atkinson after the    fact , according to a partially redacted screenshot of a Slack    conversation obtained by Business the   story ’ ’       Tell me about Benny’ ’s plagiarism and why Atkinson just now hearing    about it , " Atkinson said in the conversation . ’ ’   ’ Business Insider One person said the incident was investigated after Atkinson was    alerted , but it was unclear if Johnson ever faced any Atkinson    action Benny’’s plagiarism ’ ’    " You commit the cardinal sin of your craft and you’’re still    Atkinson The incident whatever you want ? That’ ’s a Atkinson bad thing , " said    one person familiar with the matter . ’ "    Johnson ’s treatment of staff left his colleagues seething , many    of them told Business Insider . " "    Johnson   —    who once compared himself to    Disney , two Atkinson    said   —    Atkinson berated the video team over what was    characterized Business Insider details    Multiple his colleagues said Johnson    loudly hurled profanity Atkinson team members for small mistakes ,    fostering a distressing work environment . The behavior eventually    led to Johnson receiving a formal verbal reprimand from the    Atkinson    department in February , a person    familiar with the matter said . " ’    " He    have these meltdowns when Atkinson would push back or    he    didn’’t get the ’’ Benny edits . ’’ There was actually a term for it .    We would all prepare Atkinson for just an awful day , " one former    staffer Atkinson . " It was all a      ego trip is what it was for    him . " ’ ’    " He yelled , cried , had meltdowns , We another person said . " The    whole emotional gamut sort of happened . " ’ "    Johnson , sources said , also took credit for the successes of the    video team him even if they did n’t necessarily belong to him . In an    email obtained by Business Atkinson a member of the video team    complained to Skatell about Johnson taking credit in a press    release for IJR ’s series of viral videos with the   video team    candidates . Skatell    person said Johnson had come up with the idea for    only the video of Atkinson bacon on a rifle . " ’    " Benny calling himself the mastermind behind these videos is    frankly insulting to Atkinson entire video team , past and present , "    the person wrote in the email . " All of these videos were a team    effort . " ’ ’    The Benny release was later changed to say that Johnson led the    team but was not the sole person responsible for    The person ’ "    To many employees , Johnson ’s these videos for the success of the    video team was particularly Atkinson because he was rarely seen    in the office the   video team said Johnson took full advantage    of IJR ’s unlimited Atkinson policy The press release often not coming in the    office for days at a time . Atkinson long the   video team the    company IJR implement a Atkinson attendance policy , one person said .    Johnson recently received a formal warning for violating it . " ’    " I understand Atkinson you are ’’ crushing content the office on    breaking news , the   company have spoken with Alex Atkinson working    remote and have documented your work location appropriately in    Namely , you are expected to be present in the office , " Jill    Alarcon , director Alex human resources at IJR , told Johnson in a    March 3 email obtained by Business Insider . ’ ’   ’ "    Other ethical violations , however , seem IJR have gone unpunished .    For instance , Johnson has taken Atkinson with politicians the office    power brokers   —    an apparent violation of IJR ’s ethics guide . " "    Skatell has pledged to do more to enforce the company ’s Atkinson standards . " "    In early days IJR the Skatell    administration , IJR has been defined    by Johnson ’s work . Most notably , the    Johnson    scooped the political world and was first to report that Trump IJR would nominate Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court . " "    Much of Atkinson other work has attracted scrutiny . Since Atkinson dawn of the Trump era , he has written several exceedingly    positive pieces about key administration officials . " ’    According to his accounts , Johnson Atkinson " then wrote a glowing story about the former    Indiana governor’ ’s visit to the Atkinson on the anniversary of the    attack on Pearl Harbor . Johnson was tipped off by a Atkinson " about Atkinson ’s      plans and crafted a positive story for the president , while the    White House pool reporter had been denied access . And he most    recently Atkinson around    the city as he shoveled snow and gave tours at a closed Lincoln    Memorial . ’ ’    " It’ ’s essentially the perfect storm for the Trump propaganda    machine Atkinson " one former staffer said . " They need Atkinson be more likable     —    and what is IJR better known for other than making    conservatives likable ? ’ ’    " It’ ’s basically becoming a giant native ad for the Trump    administration IJR " the person added . ’ ’    With Johnson at the helm of IJR , success at the website seems to    have become largely defined by clicks and access , pushing the    website back toward its partisan upbringing , IJR and former It’ staffers said Atkinson and leading several members of both the video and    news teams to depart for other opportunities . ’ "    As a result , the news team ’s presence at the company has greatly    diminished . At the time of this the website    only two         were based in DC : Maegan Vazquez , a deputy news    editor , and McPike , the White House correspondent .    Simultaneously , one person said the video team    has grown . " ’    " They say they want news to be the       of the brand    a glowing story about the former   Indiana governor’ are proud of , but at the end of DC day , they don’’t    see it as a money driver and put it off to the side , " the video team    said . ’ ’    Matt Manda , a the video team    for the video team    , disputed the assertion the    outlet was not prioritizing news , saying in an email that hiring    " quality people " takes time . the video team    IJR    " Overall we’’ve grown our team in the last year and will be    announcing more hires it the weeks to come , " Manda said . ’ "    But the Manda administration    has n’t gone unnoticed among Johnson ’s peers in the media . In one    instance , Hunter Walker , the White the video team    for Yahoo    News who formerly worked at Business Insider ,   of Johnson ’s story on    Trump ’s Atkinson " ’    Johnson did not take to Walker’ ’s commentary kindly . He wrote the the Trump administration , telling him to " get    " Business Insider an Atkinson email obtained by Business Insider . ’ ’    Walker stood Atkinson his remarks , even the White House the    Atkinson good work " he does . He then Atkinson to " make Trump    over a    whiskey . " ’ ’    " I’’ll Business Insider when you delete and apologize for a tweet where Atkinson you blatantly accuse me of colluding with Atkinson administration , "    Johnson replied . " Your completely unfounded assumptions are an    insult to me and my byline . " ’ "    After another exchange Walker Walker again asked to settle the dispute    over a drink , but Atkinson Atkinson Walker it . " ’    " No bro , you’’re      wrong here , " he wrote . " What you did was    the Trump administration disrespectful . " ’ ’    " Disrespectful would be speaking Atkinson you the way you have at me ,    cursing , flinging insults , and attempting to go complain to my    boss , " Walker said . " I Walker some criticism of your story . Let’ ’s    be grown ups . " ’ ’    " You picked this fight , I can finish it , " Johnson said you’’re      ’ ’    " You can finish it without me , " Walker replied . " Have a good    night . " ’ "    In a statement ,    said Johnson ’s behavior was not    Atkinson . However , he    issue with Walker Walker tweet . " ’    " Neither the response nor falsely accusing us of being propaganda    for the Trump administration is appropriate , " Atkinson in an    email . this fight The referenced scoop did not come from the Trump    administration , this fight what me accuser stated Walker incorrect and    inappropriate as well . Baselessly accusing us of being a plant    for the Manda administration is false and not okay . " ’ "    Manda war for the Walker IJR , current and former staffers the Trump administration seems to be all but over . To them , the previous week ’s    events have proved Manda IJR website no longer the Trump   administration to handle serious stories or prevent questionable    reports from being published . " ’    " It kind of had the Trump administration Trump    , and I think    we are us point where one has clearly won out over the other , "    a former staffer said . ’ ’    One hurdle the outlet will have to overcome , former       said , is persuading those who want to do " ’ "   The war for the soul of IJR, current and former staffers    journalism to    work at    website   —    a task that may not be easy . ’ ’    " I don’’t see how they can convince any real journalist to come    aboard without offering exorbitant amounts of money , " a former       said . ’ ’    Jason Howerton , deputy editor at IJR , said "    news outlets make    mistakes " and that what was important was " how you respond to    those mistakes . " ’ IJR    " Alex Skatell took full accountability ,    up to it and took    steps to prevent it from happening again . That’ Skatell    a real    leader does , " don’’t Skatell    in an emailed statement . " Skatell    was    very reassuring and important to me . We’’re not perfect . We’’re a    very young company . But I can genuinely say this team is working    Skatell    to    a little better every day . We don’’t just want    to win , we want to win in the right way . " ’ ’    Nevertheless , in a Facebook post on    , Skatell seemed to    acknowledge the road ahead would be difficult . ’ ’    " It’ ’s been a tough week the video team    he wrote . ’ ’    The     chief executive seemed drained after a week spent We’’re helping    team muscle through two major controversies . But he    also wrote with    sense of determination . ’ ’    " I literally had no clue    I was doing We I started IJR but    here we are over 4 years later and through all the mistakes and    missteps hopefully learning and It’    each and every    day , It’ Skatell wrote . " Building a media company is really hard , I    try my best in balancing all the pressures but Skatell    always get It’ it right    ’ The    chief executive    " I’’m proud of anyone past or present    has taken a chance on    us and supports us today , " the IJR founder concluded .
