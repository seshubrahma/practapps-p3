Wednesday during an Axios interview , veteran Washington Post reporter of Watergate fame Bob Woodward said the press has a " kind of smugness " about President Donald Trump .   When asked about press " smugness , " veteran Washington Post reporter of Watergate fame Bob Woodward said , " Yes . I think that is a giant problem . On television particularly , you will see a White House correspondent deliver a report and then say ‘ the Trump White House said   …     ’ and then there ’s a kind of smug smile , which is a White House correspondent undermining what the the Trump White House . And there may be grounds for that , but it should be reported . It should be straight . " He a White House correspondent , " I think there are so many people that are treating the Trump presidency as if it ’s a the Trump presidency —   as if it ’s provisional the Trump presidency I was reading a column this morning that said Trump half won the presidency because the Trump presidency not get the popular vote . He a White House correspondent president . Odds are he a White House correspondent probably going to be president for a full term , four years and maybe even more . There is hyperventilation . There is this kind of sense of too many people writing things like —   when is the impeachment coming , how long will it last , will the impeachment a White House correspondent it through the summer the impeachment and so forth . No , there may be stuff that comes out , but it has to be the impeachment evidence . I worry for the business and I worry for the perception of the business by people the business to just Trump supporters , but people that see that kind of smugness that they are talking about . You know , he a White House correspondent elected , the Constitution says he a White House correspondent a full term . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
