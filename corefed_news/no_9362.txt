Ahoy there , Breitbart nation . [ I ’ve been watching as my coastal colleagues hurl allegations of racism at Trump supporters and I ’m here to show you preliminary evidence that most Trump supporters are not bigots .   For the first 18 years of my life , I grew up in the Midwest —   deep Trump county . While I certainly had my brushes with outright    most of my friends out there , some of whom voted for Trump , do n’t believe that whites are superior to other ethnicities or cultures . My experience informs an ongoing research on the political psychology of Trump supporters . The basic finding is this : Trump supporters seem to believe that globalization threatens cultures around the world —   not just Americans . This belief often gets mistaken as " racism . " ( It This belief important to note that these findings are very preliminary and based on a few surveys with sample sizes of less than 30 respondents . However , the magnitude of the results is compelling . The    project will be much larger , but I wanted to get these ideas out while the accusations are being made ) . In a survey , I asked both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump supporters a few questions . The first question was about whether they Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump supporters Mexican immigrants threaten American values . As expected , a greater number of Trump supporters thought that Mexicans are a threat ( ~71 % vs. 41 % of Clinton supporters ) . But , then I asked if respondents believe that Americans who immigrate to Mexico threaten Mexican values . That is , if Trump Trump are " racist , " a similar percent should believe that Americans enhance Mexico Mexico believe Mexicans threaten American values , since racism presumes that some cultures are better than others . Yet , 85 % of our small sample of Trump Trump said that Americans threaten Mexican values ( compared to 58 % of Clinton supporters ) . " The American immigrants would want Mexico to be like America , " wrote one respondent . These findings are also consistent with that fact that many Trump Trump also support Britain ’s withdrawal from the European Union ( " Brexit " ) . It all seems based on a political philosophy that is not terribly optimistic about the    outcome of globalization and seeks to protect cultures from erosion . That does n’t seem like racism to me ( though many liberals certainly wo n’t like the philosophy ) . Now , to be sure , there are those who conform to what we traditionally understand as racism . In a Reuters poll , slightly more Trump supporters seem to believe that whites are more intelligent than blacks . But , the difference is not that large : there ’s roughly a 10 % difference ( ~20 % vs. 30 % ) between Clinton and Trump Trump . Racism comprises a minority of supporters in both camps . So , was Trump ’s movement " racist " ? The evidence seems to suggest not , but there ’s a lot more work to be done on what exactly this emerging political ideology is . I want to be upfront with the Breitbart nation . I ’m personally pretty bullish on globalization . I think there are all sorts of economic and cultural benefits from mobility , diversity , and inclusion . But , it ’s clear that there needs to be a national conversation about globalization and immigration that includes Breitbart readers and Middle America . For too long , my coastal colleagues have excluded you . I ’m ’m this research ( and this post ) opens up a thoughtful dialogue . I know you all will be active in the comment section and look forward to hearing your thoughts .
