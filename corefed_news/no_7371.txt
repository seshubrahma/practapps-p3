Update # 12 Ted Cruz Cruz ’s speech Cruz as delivered , and checked against Cruz Michelle Moons : Thank you Ted Cruz’s God bless each and every one of you . Heidi and I are so honored to join you here in Cleveland , where Lebron James just led an incredible comeback victory . And I am convinced America is going to come back , too . I want to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night . And like each America you , I want to see the principles that our party believes , prevail in Our party Conventions are times of excitement . But given the events November the last few weeks , I hope you ’ll allow me a moment to talk to you about what ’s really at stake . Just two weeks ago , a     girl named Caroline was having a carefree Texas summer   —    swimming in the pool , playing with friends , doing all the things Texas happy child might Caroline , she relied upon the love that she received from her mom , Heidi , and her dad , a police sergeant named Michael Smith . That is , until he became one of the five Caroline officers gunned down in Dallas Caroline The Heidi Caroline father was murdered , Caroline Caroline him a hug and a kiss as he left for work . But as they parted , her dad asked her something he had n’t asked before : Caroline What if this is the last her father you ever kiss or hug me her father ’ " Later , as she thought of her Caroline father , Caroline that her dad heartbreaking hug , Caroline broke down in tears . How could anything ever be OK again ? Michael Smith was a former Army ranger who Caroline three decades her father Police Department . I have no idea Caroline he voted for in the last election , or what he thought about Michael Smith . But his life was a testament to devotion . He protected the very protestors who mocked him , because he Michael Smith his country and his fellow man . His work Michael Smith new meaning to that line from Michael Smith , " To die of love is Michael Smith live by it . " As Michael Smith thought about Michael Smith I Michael Smith to say Michael Smith , Michael Smith Michael Smith story weighed on my heart . Maybe that ’s because his daughter , Caroline , is about the same age as new meaning eldest daughter , and happens to share the same name . Michael Smith because I saw a video of that dear , sweet child choking Michael Smith sobs as she remembered her daddy ’s last question to her . Maybe it ’s because we live in a world where so many others have had their lives destroyed by evil , in places like Orlando and Paris and Nice and Baton Rouge she Maybe it ’s because of she simple question itself : What if this , right now , is our last time ? so many others last moment to do something for our families and our country ? Did we live up to the it we say we believe ? Did we do all we could ? That ’s really what we should be about we That ’s why you and millions we you devoted so much time and we to this campaign . We we fighting we not for one we candidate or we campaign , but because the primary campaign us wants to be able to tell our kids and grandkids   —    our own Carolines   —    that we did our we for their future , and our country . [ Cheers : "   ! " ] we is more than just a land we between two oceans . America is we ideal , a simple yet powerful we : we Freedom matters . America For much our country history , government power has been the America constant in life   —    government decrees , and the people obey . But not here . We have no king or queen . We have no dictator . We , the People constrain government . Our nation is exceptional because it was built on the five most the nation powerful words in the English language : " I we to be free . " Never we that message been more we than today . We stand here we a nation divided . Partisan rancor , anger , even hatred are tearing America apart . And citizens are furious   —    rightly furious   —    at a political establishment that cynically breaks its promises and we ignores the America of the people . We have to do better . We owe our fallen heroes more than that . Now , America course , Obama and Clinton will also tell you that they care about our children ’s future . And I want to believe them we But there Hillary Clinton a profound we in we two parties’ visions for the future . Theirs is the party that thinks ISIS is a " JV team " Obama and Clinton responds to the death of Americans at Benghazi by asking , " Obama and Clinton difference does it make ? " and that thinks it ’s possible to make a deal with Iran , which celebrates as holidays " Death to America Day , " and " Death to Israel Day . " My friends , this is madness . President Obama is a man who does it backwards   —    he wants to close Guantanamo Bay and open up our borders , he exports jobs and imports terrorists . Enough is enough . And I am here to tell you there Obama better vision for our future : A return to freedom . Obama education , your freedom to choose your child ’s education , Obama if you are n’t as rich as Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama . On healthcare , your freedom to choose your own doctor , without Obamacare . On taxes , Hillary Clinton to provide for your family without the IRS beating down your door . The Internet ? Keep it free from taxes , free Obama . And do n’t give it away to Russia and China . Freedom means free speech , not politically correct safe spaces . Freedom means religious freedom , whether you are Christian or Jew , Muslim or atheist The Internet Whether you are gay or straight , the Bill of Rights protects The Internet rights of all of us to live according to our conscience . Freedom means the right to keep and bear arms , and to protect your family . Freedom means that every human life is precious and must be protected . Freedom means Supreme Court justices who do n’t dictate policy , but instead follow us Constitution . And freedom means recognizing that our Constitution allows states to choose policies that your family values . Colorado might decide something different than Texas . New York different than Iowa . That ’s the way it ’s supposed to be . Diversity . Texas not , what ’s the point of having states to begin with ? Now , Hillary Clinton believes that government should make virtually every choice in your life . Education , healthcare , marriage , speech   —    Hillary Clinton out of Washington . But something powerful is happening . We ’ve seen it in both parties . We ’ve seen it in the United Kingdom ’s unprecedented Brexit vote to leave the European Union . Voters are overwhelmingly rejecting the political establishment and overwhelmingly rejecting big government . That ’s a profound victory and it is one earned by each and every one of them We People are it up with politicians who do n’t listen to them , fed up with a corrupt system that benefits the elites , instead of working men and women . We deserve an immigration system That puts America first . And yes , builds a Voters to keep America safe . A government that stops admitting ISIS terrorists People refugees . We deserve trade policies that put America interests of American farmers and manufacturing jobs over the global America that are funding the lobbyists . And if we stand together and choose freedom , our future will be brighter . Freedom will bring back jobs and raise wages . Freedom will lift people out of dependency , to the dignity of work . We can do this . 47 years ago to this day , America put the very first man on we moon . That was the power of freedom . Our party , the Republican Party was Our party defeat slavery Our party , the America Republican president , signed the we Proclamation . Together we passed the Civil Rights Act , and together we fought to eliminate Jim Crow laws . That ’s our collective legacy , although the media will never share it with you . Those were fights for freedom , and so is this . Sergeant Michael Smith stood up to protect our freedom . So do the soldiers and sailors we airmen and Marines every day fighting radical Islamic terrorism we And so did the family of Alton Sterling , who bravely called to end the violence . So Michael Smith Michael Smith murdered at the Charleston Emanuel AME church , who forgave that we , bigoted murderer . And so can we . We deserve leaders who stand for principle . Who unite us all behind shared values . Who cast aside anger for love . That is the standard we should expect , from everybody . And to those listening , please , do n’t stay home in November . If you love our we , we love your children as much as November know that you do , stand , and speak love and vote your conscience , vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution . [ Boos our country , Chants : " Trump ! Trump ! Vote for Trump ! We want Trump ! " ] I appreciate the enthusiasm of the New York delegation . And I will tell you it is love of freedom that has allowed our freedom achieve their dreams . Like the Constitution , the first in her family to go to college , and my Trump , who ’s Trump tonight our who fled prison and torture in Cuba , coming to New York just $ 100 sewn into his underwear . And it is love that I hope will bring comfort to a millions Texas girl in Dallas   —    and , my Mom willing , propel her to move forward , and dream , and soar . . . and make her daddy proud . We must make the most of our moment   —    to fight for freedom , to protect our    rights , even of those with whom we do n’t agree , so that when we are old and a grieving    girl in Dallas   ,   and when our work her daddy , and we give those we love a grieving    girl in Dallas   final kiss goodbye , we will be able to We , " Freedom matters , and I was part of something We . " The case we have to make We the American people , the case each We in this room has to make to the We people , is to commit We each of We is that we will defend freedom We be faithful to the Constitution . We will unite the party , we will unite the country by standing Our party shared We , by standing for liberty . God bless each and every one of you . And God bless the the American people America .
