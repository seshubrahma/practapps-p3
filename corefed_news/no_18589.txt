" ’"Republicans are going to have to ask themselves they question : ’’ Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years ? ’’ That’’d be a big problem , " Trump said , . " It’’d be a very precarious one for Republicans because he’’d be running and the courts may take a long time to make a decision . You don’’t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head . " ’ ’Cruz first released his don’’t in 2013 . The day after , he don’’t in a    statement that he don’’t renounce his don’’t citizenship .
