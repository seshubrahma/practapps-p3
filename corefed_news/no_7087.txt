.@seanspicer : " Irresponsible " for Obama to act on intel report on alleged Russian hacking as it is not yet final https :   .   Monday on CNN ’s " New Day , " incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer fielded questions from    Alisyn Camerota about what    Donald Trump ’s reaction should be to the allegations the Russian government was behind hacking activity that potentially led to last month ’s election outcome .   incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer responded by telling   Alisyn Camerota incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asking   Alisyn Camerota to react to intelligence that was not finalized , which   Alisyn Camerota deemed to be irresponsible . " The    is privy to a lot of classified information , intelligence reports .   Alisyn Camerota gets briefed by   Alisyn Camerota national security team on a daily basis . So as      Alisyn Camerota is privy to information that most people are n’t and   Alisyn Camerota ’s able to understand what the intelligence is and draw conclusions from that . One thing I think that ’s missing from this discussion , is that this report that everybody keeps talking about is not final . The current president of the United States has n’t seen a final report . The intelligence community is talking about wrapping The intelligence community up later this week . So , for anyone to talk about what ’s in a final report , it ’s not final yet . I think the idea that we ’re jumping to conclusions before we we a final report is frankly irresponsible . " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
