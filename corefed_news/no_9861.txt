Ted Cruz (R) ’s name appears on a Canadian government document , obtained by TPM in 2013 , that lists Canadian citizens Canadian to vote in 1974 . TPM shared TPM electronic copy of the document with Sen. Cruz Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) when it originally obtained TPM document in a Canadian government document Cruz ’s    Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) , Sean Rushton , emphasized that the document is not a Canadian government document of people who actually voted in any election . He further pointed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) that the document itself provides notice a Canadian government document for corrections , " " deletions from , " and " additions to " the list may have been necessary .
