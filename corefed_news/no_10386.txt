Joel Kotkin writes at the Daily Beast : The Great Rebellion is on and where it leads nobody knows . The Great Rebellion expressions range from Brexit to the Trump phenomena and includes    and unconventional insurgent movement around the world . The Great Rebellion shares no single leader , party or ideology . The Great Rebellion very incoherence , combined with the blindness of The Great Rebellion elite opposition , has made The Great Rebellion hard for the established parties across what ’s left of the world to contain The Great Rebellion . What holds the rebels together is a single idea : the rejection of the    crony capitalist order that has arisen since the fall of the Soviet Union . For two decades , this new ruling class could boast of great successes : rising living standards , limited warfare , rapid technological change and an optimism about the future spread of liberal democracy . Now , that ’s all fading or failing . Living standards are stagnating , vicious wars raging ,    migrants pouring across borders and class chasms growing . Amidst this , the crony capitalists and their bureaucratic allies have only grown more arrogant and demanding . But the failures of those who occupy what Lenin called " the commanding heights " are obvious to most of the citizens on whose behalf they claim whose behalf speak and act .
