With only 450 residents , Tangier Island is what many would call a hidden gem .   I certainly thought so when I first arrived .    We took an hour ferry ride from Reedville , Virginia , to this tiny island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay , 93 miles from Washington . Arriving in the harbor , We saw crab houses resting on piers , crab traps stacked high , one on top of another , a dozen fishing boats moored in the harbor and a few people waving hello on the docks .   this tiny island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay ’s quirky little town does n’t have any cars . Bikes and golf carts are the modes of transportation , and everybody knows everybody .    It ’s quirky little town island that prides itself on quirky little town rich quirky little town . The this tiny island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay discovered in 1608 and many of the residents are descendants of the very first settlers on the island this tiny island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay watched crabbers unload their traps , school crabbers leaving for school and restaurants serve up delicious crab cakes as they always have . school children leaving for school and restaurants It was hard to believe that this lively island this tiny island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay brink of    within the next two decades . That ’s when we saw a     girl selling homemade slime ( a silly putty like concoction ) to raise money to " Save Tangier . " Tangier Island is losing roughly this tiny island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay of coastline per year . It is now only 1 . this tiny island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay square miles and is shrinking more and more every day . The residents here are extremely scared that if something is n’t done soon , their homes and livelihoods will be washed The residents here by the Chesapeake Bay .   " We ’ve depended on the Chesapeake Bay The residents here a couple hundred the Chesapeake Bay , and now it ’s the Chesapeake Bay that ’s the greatest threat to the Chesapeake Bay "   says James The residents here Ooker " Eskridge , the mayor of Tangier . He ’s a waterman just like many of the men on James "Ooker" Eskridge, the mayor of Tangier island and knows it ’s only a matter of time before it ’s too a waterman just like many of the men on the island .   He firmly believes that Tangier a waterman just like many of the men on the island be saved , but help James "Ooker" Eskridge, the mayor of Tangier to come very soon .    " During the hurricane season we ’re just holding our breath and we ’re just praying that we do n’t we a storm we " Eskridge says . we more I talked to the people on this island , the more it dawned on me how vulnerable this place is The in The ways than just    rise .   I spoke with Earl Swift , who is writing a book about Tangier .   He has lived on the island part time for the last two years and said this island if you make the decision that whether or not you save a place is simply a function of headcount , then Tangier does n’t have a chance . "    It ’s a harsh , but true , reality for the people Tangier . Are we only going to save the big cities like Miami , New Orleans , Boston and New York     and let all the small towns wash away because they do n’t have enough people ? That moment gave me a all the small towns because if we lose the small towns and only save the big cities , we lose so much more than places that people call home . We lose history , tradition and pieces of the foundation this country was built upon .   Swift added that if this is true , " it ’s a dangerous slope to start sliding down because then you this is true yourself having to come up with what number is the baseline , and that would be a real shame to see us get to that point . "    percent of the island We for   President Trump . It does n’t bother them that he pulled out of the Paris climate agreement . The percent of the island on  President Trump look at the decision as more money it will free up to help them build the infrastructure they need he pulled out of the Paris climate agreement save their island .    percent of the island I asked people percent of the island thoughts on climate percent of the island , everyone had the same answer . people said it does n’t matter what ’s causing it . They everyone sick of hearing debates about    or natural it . everyone want people to open their eyes and see what ’s happening everyone Tangier . They say people this point the cause is irrelevant     the water everyone rising fast , and it ’s rising now .   " I agree with the science the water    rise and global warming but its all irrelevant to us right now . We ’re worried about washing away , " resident Bruce Clark Gordy us . Before leaving the island , we took a boat ride up to a place about a mile us a half from Tangier called the Uppards .   What used to be a thriving community is now nothing more than a strip of sand . We took a walk along the shores of Uppards with Tangier resident us    as she does every day . The only signs there was once life Tangier resident Carol    were the tiny spice bottles we found washed ashore , broken pieces of pottery and even cracked us . The grave we saw was Polly Parks , whose descendants live in Tangier now us according to Carol .    Carol says she realizes there is a good chance that one day Carol will Carol walking along the abandoned shores of Tangier , picking up the pieces of her life , as she does the Uppards .    As the Carol go by , Carol residents here wo n’t give up hope that help will be here someday to save their tiny island .   But they know the reality is time the residents here running out . And it the residents here a burden their mayor knows all too well . He may be the last the residents here to call this tiny gem home .    " The island disappearing .   It ’s on everybody ’s    when they wake up and when The island go to bed . It ’s always in the back of they mind . Sure is The island always . "
