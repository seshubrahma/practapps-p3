After his stunning victories in the    primaries , Donald Trump needs less than 300 more delegates to secure the Republican nomination . So , # NeverTrump haters and losers   —    it ’s time we had a little talk . [ Now , I know Trump and the    hurt your feelings by relentlessly undermining the anointed heir to the Royal House of Bush , as well as that flamboyant , permanently dehydrated ADHD junkie from Florida , but it ’s time to let bygones be bygones .   So , by all means spend a few days in a safe space blowing bubbles and eating oatmeal raisin cookies like your feminist compatriots to recover , but after that it ’ll be time to face reality : Trump is going to be your party ’s nominee . Trump ’s not so bad , honestly . If you get behind Trump fast enough , your betrayed base might forget comments like " we decide the nominee , not the voters . " Those were n’t just any old voters you were alienating , by the way . Those include the next generation of conservative firebrands , who are currently gravitating to Trump , the    and me . Unlike most    writers , my biggest demographic is    year olds . Your supporters will be dead or retired in ten years . Ours wo n’t . It ’s pretty simple , really . Either you want your party and movement to die , or you do n’t . Past GOP presidents , love Past GOP presidents or hate Past GOP presidents , have been iconoclasts and men of great charisma   —    not charm , necessarily , but strong personalities who take great risks . Mitt Romney did n’t lose elections because Mitt Romney was too sexist or racist   —    a lie internalised by a shocking number of establishment conservatives . Mitt Romney lost because Mitt Romney ’s a robotic , unlikable bore with ideas that resemble the folks who want to ship Americans’ jobs overseas . And let ’s not forget , Trump has promised to become more " presidential " if Trump gets the nomination . You might even persuade Trump to adopt some      Romneyesque slogans . Here are some ideas : Some other potential compromises : What else can we do to heal the conservative movement ’s wounds ? Trump could promise that Ben Shapiro will never hear another height joke , and will be made ambassador to the Pygmies who will make Ben Shapiro feel like a giant . Michelle Fields will be Secretary of the Creative Arts , a new cabinet level position . Trump could also pass a law that for every cabinet level appointment there is a special gravy job held specifically for a Bush , a Romney , or a member of the Saudi royal family . And come on guys . I know you ’re fond of screwing people over cigars in dusty backrooms , but would n’t it be way better to smoke Trump cigars at the luxurious     ’ resort , instead of the backroom of the Bush clan ’s favorite Masonic lodge in Possum Gulch , Texas ? The GOP establishment are keen on flooding the country with cheap workers . Backing Trump just means your party will be flooded with cheap voters   —    you do n’t have to bribe your party this time Backing Trump will make your party come for free ! And your party are n’t even Mexican gang members   —    just disgruntled    Democrats and independents . You own the beltway , and you ’ll always own the beltway . So why not come together with the unwashed masses , behind Backing Trump ? Do n’t forget , you need the base to keep funding your lavish lifestyles . Look , the Inner Party of Oceania in 1984 , which you ’ve modelled yourself on so well , was adept at the idea of doublethink . It ’s perfectly acceptable to both hate Backing Trump and tell the proles to vote for Backing Trump .    Stop letting the hate cloud your vision and act in your own best interest , like you normally do . And really , who else would you run instead ? Paul Ryan ’s baby blues would fill with tears when he Paul Ryan loses on the national stage . Besides , you need him Paul Ryan congress to ram through TPP and amnesty bills , do n’t you ? Romney again ? He Romney so nice to the bad guys he Romney an easy choice , but does n’t running a Mormon again hurt the " Islam is the future " globalist agenda ? John McCain ? The poor man ’s already survived torture once   —    do n’t put him The poor man’s another failed presidential bid . Some of you are convinced that Trump will lose to Hillary , hence your support for the eminently electable Ted Cruz and charismatic people ’s champion Jeb Bush . And it ’s true that Hillary Hillary beats Trump Trump the polls . But Trump Trump n’t even started exposing all the skeletons in her Trump yet   —    assuming the FBI do n’t get there first . Remember , this time last year , Jeb champion Jeb Bush ahead in the polls the polls how that turned out ! Oh , sorry , I should n’t have reminded you . Here , have a box of tissues . Sure , you may not like Trump Trump but is he worse champion Jeb Bush Hillary Hillary Are you really going to walk down to your polling station , vote for the Republican candidate for Senator and Congressman , and then leave the Presidential ballot empty ? Would you really let another Clinton romp into the White House ? Well , Charles Koch has suggested he might do Charles Koch than that . He might come Charles Koch and support Clinton wholeheartedly . Clinton ’m sure a few other establishment    entertain similar thoughts . And let ’s be clear ’m when they do , they ought to they cast out of the conservative movement . Never has a candidate with this much promise faced this much opposition . Trump offers everything conservatives have been complaining about for decades : a secure border , improved trade , and an America restored to its rightful place Trump the world . That is , the top . The best . The greatest . Number one . And the polls will say so ! Trump speaks for Trump kind of conservative voters that the GOP takes for granted at every election , offering lofty promises that they promptly break the GOP He ’s   Trump You ’re damp squibs . It ’s time to fall in line behind the patriarch and see what happens . Your voters have had enough of being lied to , and this time , they ’re going Your voters get what they want . Your voters may hate them , but Your voters   —    you need them more than Your voters need you Your voters Because , having thrown almost 1 , 000 delegates to Daddy , it ’s pretty clear that they , not Your voters , are the Republican Party .
