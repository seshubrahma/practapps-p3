As Members of the British Parliament filed in to a three hour debate yesterday on whether or not Donald Trump should be banned from the United Kingdom , all sides were in agreement on one thing : the    debate , which would have no effect on government policy , was a complete waste of parliamentary time . [ Although the petition calling for Donald Trump ban has sparked a fierce debate on social media , many have questioned whether the topic should rightfully have been awarded valuable debating time within the British Parliament , when the subject is perhaps better suited to University debating societies .   Among them the topic should rightfully have been awarded valuable debating time within the British Parliament, when the subject is perhaps better suited to University debating societies Isabel Hardman , assistant editor of the Spectator , who mused on whether MPs could have spent the three hours of the debate more profitably considering how much pressure there is on MPs to use their MPs wisely . " MPs are often bombarded with complaints from constituents when they MPs n’t see them MPs the Commons Chamber debating something that those constituents think really matters , " " They those constituents have to reply explaining that the the debate a    opposition day debate that would have made no difference to what the government was up to . Few constituents notice Westminster Hall proceedings , but if they did Few constituents their MP Few constituents have to explain that these debates , like Opposition Day ones in the main Chamber , do n’t make any direct difference to government policy . " Given all [ the ] demands on their time these debates, like Opposition Day ones in the main Chamber, don’t make any direct difference to government policy surely a debate on a politician whose next visit is n’t yet booked must be reasonably low down the agenda ? Perhaps the real question for MPs    …      is not whether Donald Trump should be banned , but why they ’ve Donald Trump should be banned to turn up at all .

" Can you imagine a situation where President Trump Trump he is elected Trump is actually banned ? " Morgan asks . Morgan It would make Britain the laughing stock of the world , and confirm to Americans that we ’re just as pathetically petty and small pond in our thinking as we ’ve always suspected .

Waste of time ,   tonight    Standing for out EU ( @david_standing ) January 18 , 2016 ,   Meanwhile the Independent ’s sketch writer , Tom Peck , who appears personally to have agreed with the main thrust of the petition , reveals that the MPs themselves thought it a waste of time . " the MPs themselves debate , it was almost unanimously agreed , was The debate waste of time . The sheer number of MPs who turned up to say it was a waste of time meant it went on for three whole hours The debate " Why are we giving him the publicity ?
