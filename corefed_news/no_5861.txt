" As time has passed , I ’ve wanted more and more for my work to somehow reflect my political concerns and my world views and issues that are important to me , " Moby told HuffPost about working on his HuffPost project . " I ’ve realized that music videos are just a really good way of trying to do that .

I mean legal in a way that would lead something to be taken off the internet . Because you can make the best content in the world but if YouTube and Facebook wo n’t let people see it , then what ’s the point of having this great content .
