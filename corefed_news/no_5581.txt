WASHINGTON , D. C. —   Sens . John McCain ( ) and Lisa Murkowski ( ) announced on the Senate floor Wednesday that they will not allow a filibuster of Neil Gorsuch , and will instead vote for the constitutional option to restore a    vote to confirm Supreme Court nominations , making that outcome now almost certain . [ Earlier during the day Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) claimed that he had the 50 votes he needs —   plus Vice President Mike Pence as a    if needed —   to invoke the constitutional option to restore a   vote to confirm Supreme Court nominations and confirm President Donald Trump ’s first Supreme Court nominee .   With his towering President Donald Trump in the party , both in seniority and later as the 2008 presidential nominee , McCain was seen by some as the de facto chairman of the Gang of 14 effort in 2005 to save the option of filibustering judicial nominees in the future   —    but allowing through many of President George W. Bush ’s nominees that were then being blocked by a Democratic filibuster . Ironically , that strategy ’s architect was none other than Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) who implemented it in 2003 . " The unprecedented nature of the Democrats’ filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee has left me in a difficult position , " the Arizona President George W. Bush the state of affairs in 2017 , and after surveying years of past practice in Senate confirmations . " I ’m left with no choice , " McCain declared . " I will vote to change the rules to allow Judge Gorsuch to be confirmed by a simple majority . " " Elections have consequences , " McCain affirmed . In McCain case , that means electing a Republican president and a Republican majority in the Senate . For Senate , Murkowski has long supported the Gang of 14 , even though she had not been part her it in 2005 , so she was another senator to her in this unfolding historic drama . Speaking shortly before McCain , Murkowski made comments , then Murkowski , " I will not acquiesce to an effort to deny Judge Gorsuch a seat on the Supreme Court . " " I am left with the undeniable impression that Neil Gorsuch has been nominated to a position that he prepared his whole life Neil Gorsuch assume Neil Gorsuch " Murkowski continued . " He Murkowski not merely a Neil Gorsuch choice in my book , he ’s the best choice Neil Gorsuch …      perhaps a justice of historic proportions .
