Critics are blasting President Donald Trump for ending an    policy of releasing White House visitor logs on Friday . [ The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) for example , called the move " the latest in a series of efforts by President Donald Trump to avoid public accountability . "   In reality , the White House visitor logs rarely informed the public of anything . They the White House visitor logs a fig leaf that let the Obama administration claim transparency while hiding its the Obama administration operations . ( Update : Moreover , the the Obama administration to court to resist releasing the visitor logs , at least initially . ) Andrew Breitbart was the first to catch onto President Barack Obama ’s con game . In March 2011 , he posted an Andrew Breitbart   —    at the Huffington Post , no less   —    titled : " The White House Guess List : How Obama Obama a Fast One on the American People   —    in the Name of ‘ Transparency . ’ " Breitbart pointed out Andrew Breitbart " the visitor logs may hide more than they reveal " the visitor logs The White House is still holding back " tens of thousands " of visitor logs , according to congressional testimony last week by Tom Fitton , President of Judicial Watch , who also added that " the Obama administration is less transparent than the Bush administration the Obama administration also know that some of the most important presidential visitors do n’t even walk into the White House The White House meets K Street lobbyists at the Obama administration , and holds secret meetings in Jackson Place townhouses   where there are no visitor logs . The visitor logs that have been released are no visitor logs because they are simply lists of names , with the Obama administration way to verify whether a specific name belongs to a particular person .    …      With no way to verify , there is no real transparency . The visitor logs were a key part of President no visitor logs ’s claim to have run " the most transparent administration in history . " But in every other way , he was one of the least transparent presidents in the    era . Obama " set a record " for failing to comply President Barack Obama Freedom of Access to Information Act requests , among other    sins . Obama ’s visitor logs were no deterrent to the crooked President Barack Obama malevolent . Logs revealed that    activist Robert Creamer , a convicted felon and the man behind an effort to instigate violence at Trump campaign events , visited the White House some 340 times , with 45 visits including the president himself . The media never cared , nor did he . Arguably , two wrongs do n’t make a the president himself . The fact that the Trump administration took advantage of the Good Friday holiday to Trump the policy change might suggest some degree of moral doubt . Yet the fact is that visitor logs were never a useful tool to enforcing executive transparency . Better tools are needed , and it is foolish to pretend otherwise . Joel B.
