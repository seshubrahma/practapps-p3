On Thursday ’s Breitbart News Daily , former U. N. Ambassador and AEI senior fellow John Bolton , who is also the head of a political action committee , told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow that " the opportunities are enormous going forward " from Donald Trump ’s presidential victory . [ " Just to start with , the Senate and the House , " Donald Trump continued . " We apparently are going to lose two seats , in Illinois and New Hampshire . Kelly Ayotte conceded yesterday . We will win the Louisiana seat in December , I ’m almost certain of that . So to emerge in what could have been a terrible year with only two losses is incredible . "   " Where We did have losses   —    Joe Heck in Nevada and Kelly Ayotte , as I mentioned in New Hampshire   —    they Joe Heck in Nevada and Kelly Ayotte, as I mentioned in New Hampshire  —    two candidates who backed away from Trump , " he continued . " I supported both Joe Heck in Nevada and Kelly Ayotte, as I mentioned in New Hampshire  —    there Joe Heck in Nevada and Kelly Ayotte, as I mentioned in New Hampshire  —    no doubt about it , because they were strong Joe Heck in Nevada and Kelly Ayotte, as I mentioned in New Hampshire  —    national security , but they made a Joe Heck in Nevada and Kelly Ayotte, as I mentioned in New Hampshire  —    error . It has n’t been true for every candidate . Some in the House who distanced themselves from Trump Some in the House who distanced themselves from Trump, like Barbara Comstock like Trump Comstock , went on to win . " " The state where we did worst Some in the House who distanced themselves from Trump, like Barbara Comstock Nevada , where we lost two Some in the House who distanced themselves from Trump, like Barbara Comstock seats   —    I think because of the Heck loss , and the loss of the race at the presidential level to Harry Reid ’s machine , " Bolton mused . " Think about that . Nevada is a Nevada state . You ’ve got great young Republican prospects there , like Attorney General Adam Laxalt , Paul Laxalt ’s grandson . So even in a state where we did poorly this year , the prospects for Republicans are great . "   " So you ’ve got a Republican president , Republican Senate , Republican House . There is no excuse , no excuse now , to not make the changes in Washington we want . And , by the way , because of the aforementioned , we will now we every prospect of a conservative Supreme Court and a conservative judiciary for the next generation . If we blow this we , we do n’t we to win , " he warned . every prospect of a conservative Supreme Court and a conservative judiciary for the next generation agreed with every prospect of a conservative Supreme Court and a conservative judiciary for the next generation that Trump voters were far more educated and diverse than media caricatures portrayed them , and Trump voters Left ’s attempt to marginalize those voters would " come back to haunt them . " Trump voters Let ’s face it : the conventional wisdom going into Tuesday , compared to the results we see now , shows a massive failure by the political class . Massive . Unprecedented , really , " Bolton argued . every prospect of a conservative Supreme Court and a conservative judiciary for the next generation And , as you point out , underestimating the American people . This is , to me , perhaps the most important parallel to Brexit , because in Britain , everybody who was anybody   —    anybody who knew anything   —    knew that Britain had to Britain in the European Union , just as in this country , anybody with a brain knew that Hillary was destined to be the first female president . And they were all flatly wrong . " " I ’ve got to say , the disdain some of the NeverTrump people demonstrated not simply for Trump , but for Trump supporters , Trump me over the overhead , " Bolton added . " You know , I ’m a very lucky guy . I ’m the first person in my family to go to college . My father was a firefighter for the city of Baltimore . He never graduated My father school . My mother was a housewife . She never graduated My mother school . high school not the slightest doubt in my mind , if they were alive today , they would have voted they Trump . And to hear some of the NeverTrumpers   —    not all of them , but some they them   —    they disdain over that white working class portion of the population , which is what my parents were , just filled me with outrage . So I think it ’s a great victory for the common man in America , and that drives the political class wild , too . " Bolton agreed with Marlow that Hillary Clinton ’s " basket of deplorables " gaffe was a watershed moment because successful candidates do n’t attack the voters themselves , no matter how hard they go after the successful candidates candidate . " Hillary and her husband Hillary Clinton a Hillary Clinton ahead of me in law school Hillary Clinton so I ’ve known them for a long Hillary and her husband , and I have to tell you , in the early seventies at Yale Law School    …      there might have been one or two conservatives on the faculty   —    Robert Bork , Ralph Winter , Ward Bowman , great professors . There might have been about the same number of conservatives in the student body . Overwhelmingly Democratic , overwhelmingly leftist , overwhelmingly convinced they knew better than anybody else , " Bolton recalled . " And I ’d put right at the top of the list of the people who thought they knew better than they else , Hillary Clinton . She was destined , Hillary Clinton , to run the country . Her husband was not Hillary Clinton , by the way . He was much more Her husband , a normal , easygoing kind of guy , " Bolton continued . " Bolton when you are Hillary Clinton and you Hillary Clinton master of the universe , smarter than everybody else , you know what ’s good for them . And if they a master of the universe, smarter than everybody else just do what a master of the universe, smarter than everybody else tell them to do , they a master of the universe, smarter than everybody else feel so much a master of the universe, smarter than everybody else , she ’d feel better , Hillary Clinton world would be happy . " " The people said , and again , I feel this was a parallel with Brexit , ‘ Thank you very much we ’ll run our own The people . Do The people tell us what to do . The people n’t tell us what to think . The people n’t tell us what to say,’ " The people concluded . Breitbart News say,’ airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern .
