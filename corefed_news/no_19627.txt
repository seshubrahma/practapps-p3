’   ’ ’    The Cubs won the World Series , Donald Trump is the      and the rent in New York appears to be falling . ’ ’      In October , the   of New York City rentals that took a      price cut , according to the listing tracker Streeteasy , topped      42 percent —   the highest level since December 2010 . The real      estate firm Citi Habitats , which draws data from the listing tracker Streeteasy own      listings , reports that the vacancy rate in Manhattan has       to 2 . 1 percent , the listing tracker Streeteasy      highest level since 2009 . Both of those indicators , in other      words , are back in Great Recession territory . " It’ ’s a      renter’ ’s market right now , " says Chris Lee , the director of      sales at Triplemint , a real estate startup .    ’ "      We do n’t know yet why that is , or how long it could last .      Certainly , rents have outpaced incomes .    tenants      are less geographically selective than tenants      used to be . New      construction has caught up with demand . But whatever the      reason , it looks like rents are about to dip . .. and then some .    " "      It is hard to overstate the impact of New York ’s high      residential rents . They all but elected mayor Bill de Blasio ,      whose campaign ’s theme was correcting for inequality . whose campaign have      driven homelessness to record levels and continue to      monopolize the disposable income of millions of New      Yorkers . whose campaign have caused dozens of commentators to question      the city ’s very identity as a haven for the castoffs and      dreamers of middle America and strivers from the rest of      the world .    " "        And because the problem of high rents is so general to        American cities right now , if New York ’s rental bubble is        about to pop , New York’s rental bubble is       about to pop may offer a lesson to places like Los        Angeles .      " "        First , a caveat : It ’s hard to generalize about rents .        Different brokerages pull data from different stocks of        apartments and report different findings . Some say New York’s        rents are already   than any          market in the country . Most say that prices        have softened or stabilized .      " "        But there ’s reason to suspect that rents are on the cusp of a        larger decline . That discounts and vacancy are at a          high is part of it . But charts like the one below ,        from Streeteasy , that show rents reaching a plateau are        likely        little behind the times . " ’          For one thing , part of the shift toward a buyers ’’ market          has been disguised by widespread and growing          " concessions " —   landlords offering a month or two of free          rent , for example , but leaving the monthly rate the same .          In August , the New York Times   on this          phenomenon in Downtown Brooklyn , where a massive building          boom has seemingly created a new skyline overnight .          Nearly every building was offering one to four months of          free rent .        ’ ’          It’ ’s not just Brooklyn . According to Citi Habitat ,           of          Manhattan transactions featured a " concession " in          November 2016 —   meaning real , lower rates for tenants aren’’t          being reflected in rent data . The concession rate has more          than doubled since . Douglas          Elliman , another broker , reports that rents are down in          Brooklyn and Manhattan and also says that          concessions have   in both boroughs          from this time last year . * That is not part of the normal          seasonal downturn in rents that happens at year’ ’s end .        ’ ’          The other thing about market reports is that they are out          of date . They show they things were going six to eight weeks          ago . A sample of December listings shows an even sharper          decline .        ’ "          Urban wonk Stephen Smith , tweeting at Market Urbanism ,          some of          these listings . A Williamsburg   down to          $ 2 , 500 from $ 3 , 500 in 2014 —   with a free month ’s rent . An          East Village   at          $ 2 , 695 —   same as its rent An         East Village   August 2009 —   and still unrented .          A Hell ’s Kitchen   rented in          2014 for $ 3 , 750 , down to $ 3 , 250 , and still unrented . A           in Downtown          Brooklyn down 30 percent since July —   with two free months . A           in          Williamsburg down $ 600 from last year , with two months          free . A   overlooking          Prospect Park , down more than $ 600 to $ 2 , 940 since it          was first listed in July —   and still available . A studio in          the          30s   for less than it rented          in 2013 .        " ’          A three bedroom on the Upper East Side that , after eight          price chops , is back to its 2010          —   and down more than          $ 1 , 000 since 2013 . Oh , and the apartment comes with two          free months —   on a    lease ( which , in a city where          rents were rapidly rising , would be more favorable to          tenants ) .        ’ "            These are anecdotes , of course . I have n’t been to these            These they ’re in bad These . Maybe their            landlords got These , or greedy . But Smith ’s point is that            this is all happening day by day . Those    graphs            are already propped up by developer concessions . And they            have n’t Those   graphs            in drops like these .          " "            What ’s more , if it is a glut , the glut is likely            just beginning .            was a record year for            residential building permits in New York City —   with            developers pressed by expiring loopholes , the city            authorized New York City 000 new units in the second quarter            and nearly 10 , 000 more in the fourth . Total permits            topped 50 , 000 —   more than any year since the early 1960s .            And many of them are n’t done yet —   according to the U. S.            Census Bureau ,   of all            multiunit projects take more than 13 months from the            permitting date to be completed . One look at the skyline            will tell you that the city is still very much in            the throes of a building            .          " "            That skyline in Downtown Brooklyn ? That ’s what a tenant ’s            market looks like .          "
