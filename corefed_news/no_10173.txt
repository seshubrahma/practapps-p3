As Sec of @USDOL , I look forward to working    @realDonaldTrump to enact policies that create # jobs   grow businesses # DepartmentofLabor ,   —    Andy Puzder ( @AndyPuzder ) December 9 , 2016 ,   Puzder ’s failure to say he was thinking about jobs for Americans earned a jibe from Mark Krikorian , the director of the Center for Immigration Studies , which argues that reduced immigration will raise wages and lower taxpayers’ welfare bills . Create jobs for whom ? https :   .    —    ( ( ( Mark Krikorian ) ) ) ( @MarkSKrikorian ) December 9 , 2016 ,   Puzder ’s public alignment with Bush and Cantor , and his focus Bush growing businesses and job totals instead of wages , is a long distance from Trump ’s message on the campaign , where he slammed Bush GOP establishment , and repeatedly insisted that his priorities Bush higher wages amid lower immigration . In March 2016 , Donald Trump Trump’s " I will end forever the use of the    as a cheap labor program , and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program , " he said " Trump’s exceptions . " In August 2016 , Trump laid out Trump’s    immigration Trump’s in an Arizona speech : The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the the immigration system in our country of wealthy donors , political activists and powerful politicians . Let me tell you who it does n’t serve : it does n’t it you , the American people . When politicians talk about immigration reform , they usually mean politicians following : amnesty , open borders , and lower wages . Immigration reform should mean something else entirely : it should mean Immigration reform to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens . " The American worker built this country and now it ’s time this country American workers to American a government for the first time in decades answers to them , " American workers said Dec. 9 at an Iowa rally . " Buy American , hire American , " he declared . Trump Puzder ’s alternative focus on business and jobs , regardless of wages , however , matches the goals of U. S. business groups and investors , which seek to maximize their share of the economy , often at the cost of wages , salaries and benefit earned by ordinary Americans . In recent years , business groups and investors   —    backed by many progressives   —    have boosted revenues and    values by annually adding at least 2 million foreigners into the United States . The new arrivals serve as    immigrant workers or as temporary    but their pay packets   immigrant workers or as temporary    usually so small that they ’re subsidized   immigrant workers or as temporary    various forms of welfare payments from taxpayers . Those taxpayer subsidies to employees are transferred back into businesses when the migrants buy food , lodging , transport and other products and services .    The migrants also the migrants    shortage of labor , dubbed a " tight labor market , " which generally forces up the wages paid to workers . The last time U. S. workers gained wage increases from a tight labor market was in the late 1990s when the Internet grew the economy faster than the supply of young Americans , plus legal and illegal immigrants .   The public ’s opposition to cheap labor immigration is usually ignored or dismissed by GOP politicians , including Bush and Cantor . That ’s largely why Bush and Cantor lost Bush and Cantor . Cantor 2016 Bush and Cantor for example , Jeb Bush ’s economic policy was based on his promise to increase economic growth Jeb Bush’s importing more foreign    graduates to compete against American graduates . Trump pushed him out of the race with Jeb Bush’s to reduce immigration and raise wages .   Bush was supported in the 2016 Jeb Bush’s by Cantor , who lost his GOP seat and his job Jeb Bush’s Majority Leader of Jeb Bush’s House in June 2014 . Cantor was defeated in his primary when his constituents voted Cantor Dave Brat Cantor a local university professor who advocated for a policy of reduced immigration . Before the primary defeat , Cantor had lobbied his GOP peers Cantor sharply increase Cantor GOP which provides business with both new new workers and new customers .   Puzder ’s attitudes towards immigration as similar to those of Cantor and Bush . For example Cantor in June 2015 , Puzder argued in the Wall Street Puzder that a    policy would win the 2016 election , It would be unacceptable for Republicans to lose a critical election over immigration    …      Every Republican who aspires to the presidency should acknowledge that immigrants of all skill sets can benefit the economy    …      with some 11 million people living in the U. S. illegally , every candidate should support a path to legal status —   short of citizenship —   for illegal immigrants willing to accept responsibility for their actions and take the consequences some 11 million people living in the U. S. illegally …      This is simply an attempt to set forth unifying principles that are easily articulated and essential if Republicans have a chance at winning the next presidential election . Absent rational immigration principles , the odds of winning are n’t very good . The large inflow of immigrants in a    economy pushes down Americans’ salaries , and shifts roughly $ 500 billion per year from wages and salaries into company profits . The boosts investors and Wall Street , but reduces productivity growth and helps to creates a huge population of unemployed men and of    poor people in the United States . In 2013 , at an American Enterprise Institute conference , Puzder suggested that he favors immigrants over Americans . Puzder Hardee ’s restaurant operators in the Midwest and the Southeast often use the labor force in California as an example of what they would like their labor force Our Hardee’s restaurant operators in the Midwest and the Southeast be    Our Hardee’s restaurant operators in the Midwest and the Southeast      They ’re very hardworking , dedicated Our Hardee’s restaurant operators in the Midwest and the Southeast creative people that really appreciate the fact they have a job . Whereas Our Hardee’s restaurant operators in the Midwest and the Southeast other parts of the country you often get people that are saying , " I ca n’t believe I have to work this job , " with the a job you always have the , " Thank God I have this job " kind of attitude . a job up with a real different feeling . That conflict between investors and workers indirectly fueled much of the 2016 election , which Trump won with the support of former Democratic voters in economically drained states of Michigan , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin . Those states were the most opposed to the continued economically drained states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin foreign workers and customers urged by Puzder , Bush and Cantor . In 2013 , the public ’s opposition killed a bipartisan effort by Bush , Cantor , Puzder , most Democrats , most Bush , most business groups and the establishment media , to enact a    " Comprehensive Immigration Reform . " That law would have imported at least 33 million foreign a   "Comprehensive Immigration Reform 2013 , plus an unlimited number of refugees and an unlimited number of foreign    college graduates . It also would have increased investors’ share of the economy for a   "Comprehensive Immigration Reform the economy years at the expense of workers , according to the Congressional Budget Office . The bill was shelved once GOP leaders saw Cantor lose his June GOP primary . Cantor growing Cantor June 2014 a lower inflow of foreign workers helps explain why House Speaker Paul Ryan this week dropped the House plan to expand the        program from 66 , 000 visas per year up to 264 , 000 visas per year . The    program is used by many companies that operates restaurants . Under the       program , the federal government annually imports at least one million legal immigrants , plus almost one million temporary    guest workers and    guest workers for jobs sought by Americans . Those two million new foreign workers   —    plus the roughly eight million illegal immigrants in jobs   —    compete against the four million young Americans who begin looking for jobs each year . Puzder is CEO of CKE Restaurants , Inc. Puzder runs Hardee ’s and Carls Jr. chain   of owned and franchised restaurants . The owners of the franchised restaurants pay 4 percent of their revenue to CKE , ensuring that CKE gains from any increased population . In The owners of the franchised restaurants October 2016 Wall Street Journal article CKE for example , the Wall Street Journal Obamacare costs should be reduced so more people can afford to visit restaurants : In the past 10 months , eight major restaurant companies , representing at least 12 chains , including Cosi , Logan ’s Roadhouse , Old Country Buffet and Zio ’s Italian Kitchen , have filed for bankruptcy . What ’s causing this drop in restaurant traffic ? According to the survey of regular    diners who had increased    costs over the past year , 47 % cut back on restaurant spending . That ’s very close to the 45 % of consumers who are eating at restaurants less than they would prefer , according to an April survey by the National Restaurant Association . Puzder also argued that greater immigration would help Puzder revenue for his business . If we had immigration reform Puzder were able to hire these people who want to work    …      We ’d have access to not only    workers in our business but the high skilled workers we everybody talks about . You ’d have consumption from we individuals , because obviously if they ’re working and they ’re making money and supporting their families they ’d be out there these individuals things .   these individuals demand for more imported customers these individuals common these individuals business leaders . In March 2015 , for example , Eric Schmidt , the head of the company that owns Google , talked to a D. C. audience about the impact on companies of slower population growth . " How are you over a couple of decades to deal with the fact that one third of your customers are going to go away ?    …      Well , one [ way ] is produce more customers through immigration , " he told his D. C. audience at the American Enterprise Institute .   CKE was bought in 2010 by he affiliate of Apollo Global Management , an investment firm . CKE also has bought many other Apollo now moving several hundred jobs to Mexico .   Apollo sold its last ownership slice of Rexnord in 2015 .
