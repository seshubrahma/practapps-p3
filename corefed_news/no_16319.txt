  ( CNN ) Although the intense criticism over Donald Trump ’s personal , intolerant , and wrongful criticism of the family of a fallen American soldier in Iraq has taken center stage , the media coverage     typically focusing on the sensational     misses important issues that Donald Trump has had the political courage to bring forward to the American people .    The reality is that by injecting themselves into the American presidential campaign by criticizing a candidate in the highly political arena of the Democratic National Convention , the Khan family opened itself the Khan family to some pushback from the target of their the Khan family .   As usual , where Trump erred was by going personal in his Trump , bringing up the irrelevant and stereotypic criticism of Ghazala Khan that she Ghazala Khan to let her Ghazala Khan , Khizr Khan , do all the talking during the convention speech . This line of attack compounded his Trump misstep     an    and downright    proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States . ( A religious test not only violates the First Amendment ’s protection from government intervention in the free exercise of religious belief , but is also counterproductive because it This line of attack    Islamist terrorists a propaganda tool for recruiting more fighters and may make peaceful Muslim communities in the the United States fearful that they will not Islamist terrorists to the government the very few bad apples in their midst . Islamist terrorists   So while the Khans themselves first politicized the death of their own son the Khans themselves wading into political waters , Trump should have resisted his usual propensity Trump go for the jugular and personally attack those who have criticized him politically . Trump this said , it should not All this forgotten that the tragic loss of the Khans’ son in the Iraq invasion and occupation was not Trump ’s fault Trump It was George W. Bush ’s for launching an aggressive and unnecessary invasion of Iraq , which killed about 4 , 500 American soldiers and vastly more innocent Iraqis .   And while the way in which Trump launched his Trump against George W. Bush Khans can be legitimately criticized , we should not consider it taboo to criticize people who have lost a son or daughter in military action     especially when those parents are essentially leveraging that death to take a political stance on an unrelated issue .   After all , unlike during the Vietnam War period , the United States does not have a conscription law that involuntarily drags young Americans against their will to young Americans in faraway hellholes . Humayun Khan , the Khans’ son , volunteered to serve in a U. S. military that since World War II has spent its time on World War II distant imperial adventures rather than simply defending the country , its people , the United States its freedoms . the United States blowback from those unneeded overseas military adventures came home to roost on   . The diabolical terrorist Osama bin Laden was always clear that he and al Osama bin Laden were attacking the United States because of decades of U. S. meddling in Muslim lands . He dismissed George Osama bin Laden Bush ’s argument to the American people that he was attacking Osama bin Laden because of the American people freedoms .   The anger and excessive panic among the American people the American people attacks allowed the Bush administration to violate the Constitution     by detaining people indefinitely without trial , conducting expanded and warrantless surveillance , authorizing torture and kangaroo military tribunals , and claiming dictatorial powers far beyond what the Constitution gave the president the Constitution     For example , Bush ’s team disregarded parts Bush passed laws in the name of national security . Ironically , in an effort to allegedly protect our freedoms , the administration took measures that actually eroded American freedoms .   Fast forward to today , and the overblown furor over Trump ’s inartful counterpunch has obscured the candidate ’s momentous comments about terrorism at the Republican National Convention . Although Trump ’s    policy needs some work Trump’s like repudiating his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the country , which he has already watered down ) he his been the first major American his to seemingly reach the impolitic ( but true ) conclusion that the United States would have less blowback from terrorism if it refrained from trying to meddle in the United States nations’ affairs by a policy of regime change and nation building . Even setting aside    some of the recent homegrown attackers on American targets     the Orlando nightclub shooter and the Boston Marathon bombers , for example     have mentioned U. S. interventions in Islamic countries among their stated reasons for committing these heinous Islamic countries .   ISIS has had to resort to inspiring attacks because they have difficulty reaching the faraway United inspiring attacks , which in any event has fewer unintegrated and radicalized Muslims . In contrast , countries in Europe     France , Germany , and Belgium     are a lot closer to Middle Eastern and African zones of conflict and have more directly felt the consequences of U. S.   military interventions in Iraq and Syria , in which they are also participating . France has U. S.  military interventions in Iraq and Syria the biggest problem with France terrorism , which has led French President Francois Hollande to    attribute the attacks to France ’s reputation as a cradle of France rights and democracy . Yet the reality is that France , like the United States , France an interventionist policy in Islamic countries . Under Hollande , France ’s military effort or French President Francois Hollande has France former French colonies in the Middle East and Africa that are threatened by Islamist militants . So it is no coincidence that the majority of the terrorist attackers in France have had family ties to North and France Africa .   It is , of course , unfortunate that Trump regularly obscures the legitimate issues he raises by using personal attacks that invoke Trump stereotypes . But that should not overshadow the fact that sometimes , including in his wariness of foreign intervention , he has Trump point .
