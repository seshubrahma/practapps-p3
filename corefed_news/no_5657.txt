   FBI figures show that the number of background checks conducted for gun purchasers in 2016 were so high they actually beat the previous annual record by more than 4 million . [ According to   FBI figures , there were 2 , 771 , 159 background checks conducted in December . That ws down slightly from the record high of 3 , 314 , 594 checks conducted in December 2015 , but was more than high enough to help make 2016 a historical year for background checks . In fact , a new    record of 27 , 538 , 673 background checks conducted in 2016 .   On top of the astounding number of checks , each check could represent more than one gun sold at retail . Checks are performed on the purchaser rather than the gun ( s ) the purchaser rather than the gun( wishes to buy . Once a check is passed , a customer can buy numerous guns . That means 27 , 538 , 673 background checks could amount to 55 , 077 , 346 guns sold , if every    buyer bought two guns . If each bought three , the figure would be 82 , 616 , 019 guns sold . It is interesting to note that 2016 had already broken all prior annual records for background checks by the close of business on November 30 . Breitbart News previously reported that there were 24 , 767 , 514 background checks January 1 through November 30 alone . The    surge broke previous    records by more than a million checks .    Donald Trump ’s decision to run as a defender of the Second Amendment seems to have caught the mood of the public   —    at least of consumers in the market for firearms , who were partly driven by concerns that new federal and state restrictions , such as ammunition background checks in California , could limit their new federal and state restrictions, such as ammunition background checks in California to own guns and ammunition . The National Rifle Association ( NRA ) backed Trump and celebrated his The National Rifle Association (NRA) .
