Dan Gainor , the vice president of business and culture at the Media Research Center ( MRC ) talked with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Monday regarding recent violence at Berkeley , as well as media coverage of the tea party versus today ’s    Antifa groups . [ The MRC ’s NewsBusters site also pointed out the discrepancy here : " Networks Parrot Demands of Liberal Tax Day Protests Smeared tea party Events Eight Years Ago . "   Characterizing previous tea party events versus events today at which Antifa shows up , Gainor said , " Conservatives are learning very quickly . " Tea party events were " a bunch of people showing up , very nice , very polite , neat , cleaning up , and that was it , " according to Gainor . " And now conservatives know , " continued Gainor , " that if you ’re going to go to a Trump rally , if you ’re going to go to any sort of event , you ’ve got to go expecting to be attacked . That means you ’ve got to wear almost combat gear , not just things to protect from someone punching you , but actually , gas masks or bandanas to cover your face because the Antifa people were pepper spraying free speech protesters . " According to Wikipedia , three violent protests at Berkeley just this year were all Antifa or leftist related . Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern .
