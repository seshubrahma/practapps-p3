  ( CNN ) I realized Donald Trump could win the presidency on a frosty January morning in Albia , Iowa , 151 hours before the start of the caucuses . Ted Cruz had just sauntered inside Bogie ’s Steakhouse , in Ted Cruz barn jacket and cowboy boots , with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry at former Texas Gov. Rick Perry side . The event opened with both men bowing both men heads in prayer under a mounted    buck ( reportedly the largest    buck ever harvested by a hunter ) .   Moments before , Cruz had insisted to reporters that Cruz was finally seeing conservatives come together because " the stakes are too high for us to get this choice wrong . " Cruz predicted conservatives would choose the proven conservative , and asked , " Who ’s stood and defended life and marriage and religious liberty ? "   But the numbers were telling a different story : Trump was rising among evangelicals . That morning , Trump had received the    endorsement of Jerry Falwell Jr.   For so long , students of politics thought the key to winning the Republican nomination was a candidate ’s ability to win over conservative evangelicals . We had wrongly assumed they would never embrace Trump , with his shifting views Trump abortion and luminous praise for Planned Parenthood .   But lingering at Bogie ’s talking to voters as the bleak winter light streamed through the blinds , many    Christian conservatives told me they were wavering many   Christian conservatives Cruz and Trump .   Trump could that be ? I asked one of them . How many   Christian conservatives so many evangelicals look beyond Trump ’s lifestyle Trump way he talked about God Trump church   —    drinking his " little wine Trump and having his " little cracker Trump "   He just looked at Trump , scribbling away at my notes . " America , " he said , " Trump a forgiving nation . "
