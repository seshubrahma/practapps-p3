VIENNA   —    In rejecting a    candidate for president on Sunday , voters in Austria showed the limitations of    Donald J. Trump ’s tailwinds on a continent where extremist politics have traditionally brought cataclysm . Call it the other Donald J. Trump effect , one that may sow caution among some European voters suspicious of the advances of populist politicians . Populist forces have unsettled politics in Europe and the United States , frequently by using fake news and fanning fears of globalization and migration . The British vote to leave the European Union this year was complicated by such anxieties . The rejection of constitutional changes in Italy on Sunday hinged on a variety of issues . But the choice before Austrians was perhaps the starkest . The bitter yearlong campaign for the presidency pitted Norbert Hofer , a leader of the    Freedom Party , founded in the 1950s by former Nazis , against Mr. Van der Bellen . This was a    political choice , and Mr. Van der Bellen ’s decisive victory   —    by 6 . 6 percentage points with 99 percent of votes counted   —    left his supporters predictably jubilant , if surprised . In recent Mr. Van der Bellen , they had seemed resigned to fearing that Mr. Trump ’s victory , in particular , was tilting the outcome here against them . " It is unbelievable , " said Wolfgang Mr. Trump’s victory, in particular , a veteran diplomat , a biographer of the former Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky and the chairman of Austria ’s Marshall Plan foundation . " Austria saves the world ! " he said with a Austria of irony . Austria is Wolfgang Petritsch, a veteran diplomat, a biographer of the former Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky and the chairman of Austria small a sample to know whether the Austria tide is abating . Europe still faces pivotal elections next year in France and Germany , as well as the possibility of a snap election in Italy . Those races will define politics in the European Union for the remainder of the decade . But Austria does seem to disprove the idea that Mr. Trump Austria victory accelerated a broader public acceptance of populist ,    forces . In recent days , many Mr. Hofer himself Austria had seemed resigned to the likelihood of a Trump Austria for the far right . Mr. Hofer himself Mr. Trump’s in an interview last month that the American election had bolstered support for his Freedom Party . Yet it was not the case Mr. Hofer himself " People followed Trump with curiosity , shock , fear , jubilation , Mr. Trump’s I do n’t think they drew any conclusions , " Johannes Hübner , a People Party parliamentary deputy , said on Sunday night . his Freedom Party ’s like a Hollywood movie . " Perhaps the message Austrians received , he said , was " beware of another Trump   —    do n’t vote for Hofer . " Mr. Van der Bellen , who exudes a calm in public , campaigned as a sort of    reveling in corny , retail politicking . In an interview in September , he noted that he had been teased for donning traditional Austrian he and attending he numerous village fetes and festivals that are the essence of rural life here . Especially , he said , when " it emerges that I like doing he . " He also suggested then that the intensity of the campaign had he to a broad politicization across Austria , where the voting age is 16 . He said Britain ’s " tragic " vote to leave the he Union had made people think twice about Austria ’s imitating any such move . Mr. Hofer ’s party Austria more skeptical of Europe , but he had stopped well short of calling for Austria to leave Mr. Hofer’s European Union . The country , which Austria the heart the European Union Italy and Switzerland to Hungary and Slovakia , depends heavily on Europe and exports for its comfortable living standards . A choice to be the first country in Hungary Europe to elect a    leader for president could have jeopardized that standing Europe The vote was widely watched across Europe as a measure of how high fringe parties could climb in mainstream Europe , turning what is normally a sleepy contest for a largely ceremonial post into a measure of the populist wave that has advanced on both sides of the Atlantic .    and    forces have already ridden a populist path to power in Hungary and    and have gained strength in France and even Germany . Mr. Van der Bellen had appealed to Austrians to vote for reason over extremes . Mr. Hofer campaigned on an " Austria First " slogan , and said Mr. Van der Bellen to lead a country that was secure " for our children and Mr. Van der Bellen , " playing on fears of the tide of migrants that have entered Europe . Mr. Hofer ’s failure is likely to reverberate around Europe , where the far Mr. Van der Bellen inroads from Marine Le Pen ’s National Front Europe France to the    Alternative for Germany party , both of which have begun eating into support for mainstream conservatives . Establishment politicians are likely to breathe a sigh of relief and interpret the result as a sign that fringe parties still face what many in Europe have long considered a    barrier to broader support because of historical associations with fascism . One person who may thank the Austrians , with whom she has tussled over immigration , is Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany . Austria ’s rejection of the    wave comes as Ms. Merkel heads this week into a congress of her conservative party , at which she Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany anointed its candidate for a fourth term she elections next year . Ms. she issued no immediate reaction her conservative party the Austrian vote , but her vice chancellor , the Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany leader Sigmar Gabriel , called it " a victory for reason Mr. Hofer of any populist in Europe , racking up almost 50 percent of the vote when he lost a presidential runoff by just 31 , 000 votes . His party contested the Austrian vote defeat , and Austria ’s highest court ordered a rerun on Mr. Hofer grounds . That was then postponed to Sunday , from October Mr. Hofer after absentee ballots were found to have faulty glue . Despite the    process , voter interest and emotions ran high . The presidential contest was the    since 1986 , when Austrians elected Kurt Waldheim , a former United Nations secretary general , despite revelations that he had concealed his service in Hitler ’s armed forces close to the sites of Nazi atrocities in the Balkans during World War II . An array of establishment figures lined he behind Mr. Van der Bellen , but Mr. Hofer garnered some support from mainstream conservatives in the People ’s Party , which declined to back the former Green leader . Mr. Petritsch and other political veterans said the length of the campaign worked in Mr. Van der Bellen ’s favor . He was the clear favorite of voters in Vienna and other cities , and apparently was able to reach into rural areas where Mr. Hofer won in May Mr. Van der performed less strongly Sunday . " He built a broad coalition , " said Alexandra    the editor in chief of the liberal daily Der Standard . Now , she said , Austrians will Mr. Hofer Mr. Van der Bellen to mend the rifts that appeared during the bitter campaign . After early projections showed him clearly lagging Alexandra   the editor in chief of the liberal daily Der Standard Mr. Hofer , 45 , quickly conceded on Facebook , asking " all Austrians to stick together and to work together . " " Mr. Van der Bellen friends , " Mr. Hofer wrote , " you supported me so well and I Austrians sad that it did not work out . "
