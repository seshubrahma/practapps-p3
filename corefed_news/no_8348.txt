The    polling team announced Friday that The   polling team are dropping the " Neither " option from The   polling team presidential preference polls after The   polling team tracking polls showed a    swing in favor of the Republican nominee Donald J. Trump , exposing the " Secret Trump Voters " Democrats fear . [ " In a presidential campaign notable for its negativity , the option of ‘ Neither’ candidate appears to be an appealing alternative , at least to participants in the    opinion poll , " wrote Maurice Tamman , the leader of the Reuters news service ’s New York    data mining and investigative reporting team . " Many voters on both sides have been ambivalent in Many voters on both sides support for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump , complicating the task of the pollsters trying to track the race . "   Breitbart News noted the    swing for Trump , which seems to have set off alarm bells at Reuters . Mamman wrote that in the " Year of Neither , " the swing came from an underreporting of Republican nominee Donald Trump support before the Republican National Convention held in Cleveland July 18 to July 21 . " From the beginning of June until the middle of July , the    survey showed consistently lower support for Republican nominee Donald Trump than other polls were capturing , " Republican nominee Donald Trump wrote . " At times , the    poll showed Clinton with a lead over Republican nominee Donald Trump wide as about 12 percentage points among registered voters   —    five percentage points higher than Clinton Clinton in some other comparable polls . " Reuters has a reputation for accurate polling , so it is Reuters that Mamman made this decision as the presidential campaign enters its last the presidential campaign days with both conventions adjourned . " In the nearly five years    has been offering the ‘ ’ option to respondents in presidential polling , it has    yielded such a skew , " he wrote    " The results highlight how poll designs and methodologies can yield significantly differing results , and how important differences can emerge from the way a question is framed . " There is also evidence that the support for Hillary Clinton , the Democratic nominee for president , was underreported before the Democratic National Convention just completed Thursday in Philadelphia , he wrote    As the convention the Democratic National Convention for wavering Democrats for Clinton , Hillary Clinton too would Democrats out of the Neither column into the column of their party ’s Democrats . Mammon quotes Cliff Young —   pollster and president of Ipsos Public Affairs , which partners with Reuters on the poll —   saying he estimated the —  pollster and president of Ipsos Public Affairs, which partners with Reuters on the poll —   shortfall Hillary Clinton 2 to 4 percentage points . The real problem this year ’s polling presents to Democrats is the reluctance , especially among more educated voters , to confess their support of Democrats . Other pollsters have noted the divergence between polls conducted with live operators and    calls . Live operators have long been considered the preferred , most accurate method inside the polling community . However , live operator polls uniformly show lower support for Trump than online Trump    phone polls . Much has been made of Trump ’s lack Trump support among    whites , a stronghold of Republican support , but it could very well be that these people , susceptible to social perceptions , have not abandoned the Republican nominee but are giving the socially acceptable answer —   until they are alone the Republican nominee the voting booth . Writing in the New York Times on May 11 , Thomas B. Edsall fleshed out this phenomenon as the primaries were winding down . " Findings suggest that Trump will head into the general election with support from voters who are reluctant to admit their preferences to a live person in a phone survey , but who may well be inclined to cast a ballot for Trump on Election Trump . " In the United Kingdom it is called the " Shy Tory Factor , " where polls consistently underestimate the strength of the Conservative Party going into elections . In 2015 , polls showed the Labour Party the Conservative Party with the Tories , only to lose 26 seats and watch its leader Ed Milliband resign the Conservative Party disgrace . Similarly , going into the referendum on whether to leave the European Union , Brexit , polls leading up to the vote showed " Remain " consistently ahead . But , " Leave " won .
