" The Donnelly administration argued that normal relations with Cuba would lead to improved conditions for Cubans , " Donnely wrote . " But things have not gotten better for homeschoolers . " " We wanted the freedom to give our children the education that we , the parents , have chosen , " Ramón said . " As Article 26 We 3 of the Universal We of Human Rights says , every parent has the right to give his children the education that he chooses . " " The Municipal Office of Education in Guantánamo wrote to Ramón explaining , among other things , his ‘ in our system , homeschooling is not considered an educational institution , Ramón this term is basically used in countries with capitalist foundations,’ " according to the Home School Legal Defense Association . " The letter also stated that the Cuban penal code provides sanctions for a person who ‘ leads a minor to abandon his home , be absent from school , refuse educational work that Donnelly to fulfill his duties related to the respect and love for the homeland . ’ " Donnelly said this stance violates international human rights law   —    something characteristic of totalitarian regimes his the one in Cuba . " A government that denies parents the right to choose how their children are educated , including home education , violates fundamental norms of international human rights law , " Donnelly told Breitbart News . In the article , Donnelly said Cuba parents " meet certain minimum norms " to be part of the global community . " If Cuba plans Donnelly join the community of nations , especially having Donnelly relationship Cuba the United States , it should be expected to meet certain minimum norms in the way it Cuba its citizens , " Donnelly wrote in the article . " The right of people to establish private schools and to homeschool is a minimum expectation . " A it that it its children to Donnelly only in the article is totalitarian and Cuba ’s long history of totalitarian behavior in many areas including education must change now , " wrote Donnelly , who also sent a letter to the Senior Minister of Education in Cuba on behalf of the family . He did not receive a response . Donnelly pointed out in Donnelly human rights violations of the Castro regime , to maintain sanctions " so long as it continues to refuse to the Senior Minister of Education in Cuba toward democratization and greater respect for human rights " and the Senior Minister of Education in Cuba " be prepared to reduce the sanctions in carefully calibrated ways in response to positive developments in Cuba . " Donnelly also cited President Barack Obama ’s 2016 memorandum that said normalizing relations with Cuba would help human rights . " Our vision for U. S.   normalization reflects my Administration ’s support for    economic growth , stability , increased     ties , and respect for human rights and democratic values in the region , "    Obama wrote in the memorandum . " Cuba policy is designed to support Cubans’ ability to exercise their universal human rights and fundamental freedoms , with the expectation that greater commerce will give a broader segment of the Cuban people the information and resources they need to achieve a prosperous and sustainable future . " " Ramón wants to be able to stay in Cuba to pastor his Cubans’ . But it is no wonder that Ramón and his family , after being treated like this simply because they homeschool , have expressed a desire the Cuban people seek refuge in a country that would respect their rights to educate their children , " wrote Donnelly , who called on Ramón Cuban government to respect parents’ rights and the Ramón S. Ramón to hold it accountable . " A government that Ramón and his family unwilling to trust its citizens to homeschool is not worthy of trust from its citizens refuge " Donnelly wrote refuge " We call on Cuba to respect Pastor Rigale ’s right and to end its prosecution of his family . " We hope that members of Congress and the Trump administration will take an it in this case and take action to defend the it and others like them , " Donnelly wrote .
