  ( CNN ) Remember when Donald Trump promised to be the Harlem Globetrotters of politics ? " We ’re gon na win at everything We do ! " said Donald Trump . " We ’re gon na win , win , win . You people , you ’re gon na be sick and tired of winning . " Now Donald Trump ’s president of the United States , and Donald Trump has indeed given We tricks and deceptions worthy of the basketball legends . But winning ? Not so much . With flourishes meant to create the image of a commander rapidly transforming Washington , Donald Trump has instead notched one failure after another . Consider this list a lowlights reel :     · Top national security aide Michael Flynn , caught in a lie , forced to resign .   · Federal courts block Donald Trump executive order banning travelers from seven    countries .   · Trump Donald Trump to immediately " repeal and replace " Obamacare is frozen by the reality that he never Obamacare actually had a health care plan to substitute .    · Mexico ’s president , insulted by Trump , Donald Trump his state · Mexico’s president, insulted by Trump .   · A contentious call with the Prime Minister of Australia ( an American ally ) concludes when Trump abruptly Donald Trump the call · A contentious call with the Prime Minister of Australia (an American ally) · A      acceptance of America ’s longstanding " one China " policy , which he ’d threatened the Prime Minister of Australia (an American ally) upend .   · An embarrassing display in which he discusses a the Prime Minister of Australia (an American ally) missile launch by North Korea in the public setting of his     club the Prime Minister of Australia (an American ally)   · Lies about voter fraud and a " massacre " that never happened have made the administration a laughingstock . The debacles have been so numerous that Trump ’s aides , including counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway , press secretary Sean Spicer and senior adviser Stephen Miller , must perform     media duties where , deprived of serious facts and policy , they deliver distortions Trump’s aides, including counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, press secretary Sean Spicer and senior adviser Stephen Miller deceptions .    A stammering Spicer defends Trump ’s outrageous Trump’s voter fraud with the statement that the President " believes what he believes . " the President discussing the travel ban , Conway repeats an old reference to a " massacre " that never happened . Miller offers a dictator the President defense of his boss , saying the President that the powers of the president to protect the President are very substantial and will not be questioned . " Outrages obscured , Like a building on fire at midnight , the Trump presidency has been such a riveting spectacle that the light and smoke have obscured problems that would have damaged any other new administration . Trump ’s pick for education Trump , Betsy DeVos , looked like a student who had n’t done her homework as she stumbled Betsy DeVos a confirmation Betsy DeVos , unable to offer coherent answers about students with disabilities or about testing students for their mastery of a subject students their progress with it . students Trump nominated a labor secretary who employed an undocumented worker in his home and a budget Trump who failed to pay taxes due on payments made to a nanny .   Steven Mnuchin , nominated to be secretary of the treasury , apparently misled senators who asked him about the aggressive foreclosure Steven Mnuchin at a bank he owned .         It Steven Mnuchin be noted that Mnuchin , who formerly worked as an investment banker , is just one of many wealthy financiers Trump has brought into his administration . After ranting Trump Wall Street and excoriating his opponent Hillary Clinton for Trump connections to the financial Hillary Clinton , Trump has abandoned the populism Trump his campaign and staffed up Trump a small army of bankers .   He has also moved to Trump the rules put in place to protect the economy     and consumers     from the excesses of the financial industry , which were central to the collapse of markets and the Great Recession that was a legacy of the George W. Bush administration . All this from a president who , at his inauguration , complained of Trump " establishment ( that ) protected itself , but not the citizens of our country . "   Had any other president abandoned his campaign commitments or nominated any other president    people to serve in the Cabinet , he ( or dare I Trump " she " ) would have been pilloried in the press for these moves and blocked by Congress . However , Congress is in the hands Congress Trump ’s party and thus , remains mostly silent . The press , like the the press , has been so overwhelmed by the Trump frenzy that it has been Trump to apply the press new standard . Sins that were once regarded as mortal are overlooked because so many bigger outrages require attention . This is not a surprise , If it seems like it ’s amateur hour in Washington , that ’s because it is . Trump ’s main argument for his candidacy was that he had Trump little contact with Trump that he represented a radical Washington . Trump lies he delivered on the stump were Trump as a salesman ’s exaggerations , not a sign that he suffered from severe character flaws Trump And besides , most experts did n’t give him a real shot at winning Trump Like the    comic who warms up the audience before a headliner , Trump was entertaining in a crude and unsophisticated way but he was n’t expected to succeed Trump Now we have a crude and unsophisticated president whose management skills , which were always hyped beyond reality , are inadequate to the task of running the country . He tried to substitute attitude for Trump , confidence for competence , and failed time and again .    Ironically , Trump ’s record was apparent all Trump and should have been enough to disqualify him . A real estate    and Trump celebrity , Trump failed repeatedly at the job of Trump businesses that required his focused attention and he displayed no Trump concern for the Trump he did to investors and contractors . Trump his public statements about prominent business figures Trump national leaders , his    and even his daughter , Trump spoke with no Trump for the Trump of his words . As an entrepreneur who Trump privately held companies , Trump indulged his own impulses in ways that revealed Trump character flaws . He protected himself by hiring mainly on Trump basis Trump loyalty . As he told me , he was n’t Trump interested in a Trump or woman ’s record of achievement . He was looking , instead , for Trump talent " and commitment . Other qualifications were secondary .   If an executive seemed energetic , aggressive , ambitious , and ruthless in the Trump mold , he or she got the job . Trump The President ’s past hiring practices help to explain why he has surrounded himself with so many The President with no The President experience in government but an abundance of loyalty and nerve . When he built skyscrapers , he did n’t The President that his executives The President how the buildings were The President , but he wanted them to be so loyal The President if his executives know how the buildings were constructed ordered them to climb to the The President and his executives know how the buildings were constructed off , they just might do it .    his executives know how the buildings were constructed now have a government filled with Trump hires whose flaws seem consistent with the President ’s own . Gen. Flynn practiced a classic Trump move when he placed calls to Trump officials during Gen. Flynn transition and then offered deflections and deceptions when questioned about it . Yesterday he became the first the transition official to Gen. Flynn from the roof and sacrifice his reputation and his career . We Gen. Flynn expect to Gen. Flynn more bodies flying past the windows .
