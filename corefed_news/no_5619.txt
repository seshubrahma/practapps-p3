As the New England Patriots took yet another Super Bowl win , liberals from coast to coast exploded with vitriol on social media , furious that a team with tangential links to President Donald Trump came out on top Sunday . Since that final touchdown the hash tag # NotMySuperBowlChamps and other similar tags have been trending . [ The    sports media has been out for blood for the better part of a year because Patriots quarterback Tom Brady , coach Bill Belichick , and team owner Robert Kraft all came out as unapologetic fans of President Trump . And , now that unapologetic fans of President Trump ’ve won the Super Bowl the left has turned apoplectic .   Since last night ’s big game , liberals have flooded Twitter , Facebook , and other social media services with several versions of the hash tag after President Trump pal Tom Brady led Trump pal Tom Brady team to yet another Super Bowl title . Along with # NotMySuperBowlChamps , users also employed # NotMySuperBowlChampions and # NotMySuperBowlTeam to attack the Patriots . The winner should be determined by who has more fans , not more points . Winning is racist and Tom Brady is a fascist . # #NotMySuperBowlChamps . twitter .    —    Elizabeth ® ( @MissLizzyNJ ) February 6 , 2017 ,   * weeps * I ca n’t believe this can happen in our country ya’ll * snot bubble * @MileyCyrus # NotMySuperBowlChamps pic . twitter .    —    Jendetta © reeeeee ! ❄ ️ ( @PolitiKellyRite ) February 6 , 2017 ,   I ’m protesting # notmysuperbowlchampion ,   —    Chance Bishop ( @THEchancebishop ) February 6 , 2017 ,   The Patriots did n’t win today .
