On Tuesday ’s broadcast of CNN ’s " AC360 , " Senior Political Analyst David Gergen , who served as an adviser to Presidents Nixon , Ford , Reagan , and Clinton , argued that " we ’re in impeachment territory " with President Trump .   Gergen said , " I was in the Nixon administration as you know , and I thought , after watching the Clinton impeachment , I would never see another one . But I think we ’re in impeachment territory   …     obstruction of justice was the number one charge against Nixon , that brought him down . Obstruction of justice was the number one charge against Bill Clinton , which led to his indictment in the house , his won in the Senate . " his added that while his was n’t sure whether Trump had engaged in conduct that met the legal definition of obstruction of justice , " from a lay point of view , it looks like his was trying to impede the investigation . his was using his power to do that , and when James Comey did n’t go along with his , when James Comey was n’t his boy , James Comey fired his boy . Which , I think is also relevant to the question of what James Comey was trying to do . So , from my point of view , this is of enormous consequence for James Comey presidency . I think if you look at the three bombshells we ’ve had , the James Comey firing last week , then the sharing of this highly classified information with the Russians of all people , and now telling James Comey to drop the case , what we see is a presidency that ’s starting to come apart .
