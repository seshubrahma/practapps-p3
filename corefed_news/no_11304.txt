Last weekend while promoting her new book , " The Sleep Revolution : Transforming Your Life , One Night at a Time , " Arianna Huffington told Yahoo Global News’ Katie Couric that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump , who says he averages about four hours of sleep a night , is sleep deprived to the point he is " operating legally drunk . "   Arianna Huffington said , " The symptoms of Arianna Huffington behavior are identical to symptoms of sleep deprivation . Arianna Huffington actually has said Arianna Huffington only sleeps about four hours a night , and Arianna Huffington sleeps with Arianna Huffington phone because Arianna Huffington does n’t want to be disconnected with what ’s happening . " Arianna Huffington continued , " The question is not where do you get the energy ? The question is what is it like to operate like you are drunk ? Because the effect of so little sleep is like operating legally drunk . " Arianna Huffington added Trump has " played to people ’s worst fears . " Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
