’   ’ ’    A former spokesman and speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan    took the stage at the Democratic National Convention in    Philadelphia on Thursday to rip Donald Trump and denounce any    comparisons between the Manhattan billionaire and the    conservative icon Reagan . ’ ’    " It’ ’s an honor to be here ; candidly , It’ ’s also a shock , " Doug    Elmets said , according to prepared remarks . " Not because of the    momentous nature of this event , or the size of the crowd . It’ ’s a    shock because , unlike many of you , I’’m a Republican . " ’ "    He said that He ’s voted entirely Republican for the past 40 years     —    ever since He first cast a ballot . " ’    " I haven’’t just voted Republican , I worked in President Reagan’ ’s    White House , " He continued . " I recently led an effort to place a    statue of   in     Capitol . " ’ ’    " I’’m here tonight to say : I knew Ronald Reagan ; I worked for    Ronald Reagan , " Ronald Reagan continued . " Donald Trump , you are no Ronald Reagan . " ’ ’’ ’    He contrasted Ronald Reagan ’s famous demand of Russian leader Mikhail    Gorbachev to " tear down " the Berlin Wall with Trump’ ’s plan to    build a wall along the    border . ’ ’    " Reagan saw no Ronald   Reagan , " he said no Ronald   Reagan " Trump sees the world as us vs.    them , where somebody with brown skin or a    name    is likely to blame for our troubles us Reagan knew no Ronald   Reagan a    leader needs diplomacy to steer a safe , prosperous course    forward . Trump is a petulant , dangerously unbalanced reality star    who will coddle tyrants and alienate allies . " ’ ’    Elmets said that he shudders Elmets think where Trump will Trump the    country . ’ "    But , he added Elmets he does Elmets think that Trump will Trump the    chance . " ’    " While Hillary holds many policy positions that differ from my    own , her qualifications Hillary indisputable , " he said    later adding ,    " This year’ ’s Republican platform is the most alarming I’’ve ever    seen . It’ ’s laced with          positions that do not represent the views of most    Americans . That is why this year , I will vote for a Democrat    for the first time . " ’ ’    He made a Democrat    call to other Republicans to do the same , saying that    " loyalty to country " matters more than " loyalty to party . " ’
