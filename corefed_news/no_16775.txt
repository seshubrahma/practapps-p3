Washington ( CNN ) Donald Trump offered some excuses for Donald Trump    performance at Monday night ’s debate . There was the bad microphone which no one , except for Donald Trump , seemed to notice . Then there were the questions from the moderator , NBC ’s Lester Holt , some of which Donald Trump complained about the next day on " Fox and Friends . " " Donald Trump hit me on ’birther,’ " Donald Trump told the hosts . " Donald Trump hit me on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt . Donald Trump asked me about that . That ’s a beauty to be asked     a     lawsuit . " Donald Trump did , in fact , have to defend Donald Trump during the debate from allegations that Donald Trump was sued by the Justice Department in 1973 which charged Donald Trump and Donald Trump father with intentionally failing to rent apartments to blacks and Hispanics . Except that Holt never asked about a    lawsuit . The issue was brought up by Hillary Clinton . Trump ’s assessment on how he Trump during the debate was also a tad problematic . " I won on Slate , " Trump Trump during the same " Fox and Friends " interview . " I won Drudge in almost 90 % of the vote in that poll . I won Time magazine . I won CBS . I won every single poll other than CNN . " The problem is that the " polls " on Slate , Drudge Drudge Time were online surveys in which there was no scientifically drawn sample of people that was representative of US voters . Anyone could sign on and vote     and one could vote as many times as they Anyone . Such surveys are not considered credible . Oh , and there was no CBS    poll at all .
