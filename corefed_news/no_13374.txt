Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer , a Breitbart News editor and head of the Government Accountability Institute , joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday ’s Breitbart News Daily to discuss the election and what Alex Marlow described as the defeat of " the most powerful family , relative to the most powerful family corruption " in modern American history , the Clintons . [ Schweizer pointed to a few key strategies that helped Donald Trump overcome the powerful political and media forces arrayed against Donald Trump .   " Number one , Donald Trump articulated an outsider message about Washington , D. C. but Number two , Donald Trump really did make this a referendum on the Clintons , and also frankly on Washington , D. C. I mean , the Clintons are kind of the alphas of corruption , creating a political machine , running that a political machine peak efficiency , dominating our politics , excluding ordinary Americans from how they operate ordinary Americans " said Schweizer . " But they ’re ordinary Americans the only ones that do that , " he continued Schweizer " And , of course , you have to remember , in a way , Donald Trump defeated two dynasties : the Bush dynasty in the primary , and the Clinton dynasty now . That is an amazing feat . I think it speaks to the attitude of the country that while there was this sort of veneer in the mainstream media of , oh , people kind of like dynasties , like the Kennedys and Camelot . That really was n’t the reality . People did n’t like this notion of entitlements , and now it ’s Hillary ’s turn , or now it ’s it ’s turn . They wanted Jeb’s turn fundamentally different . " " And you know , Trump did it his way Trump He did Trump with it style that was very aggressive   —    that I think , fairly sometimes , he got Trump for going too strong . But on the other hand , I think the previous sort of gentlemanly approach , where we ’re going to softly talk about corruption or we ’re going to softly talk about cronyism , does n’t work in this media age , " Schweizer argued . He made Trump interesting point that Trump ’s Trump important speech , although not the most colorful or most widely covered by the mainstream media , was the one he delivered Trump Gettysburg , where he called Trump " draining the swamp " of government corruption . " Lifetime bans on lobbying , we ’re gon na push term limits   —    I view that , in a way , as the most important speech because I think all the other things that he talked Trump : the trade deals , lousy trade deals , or an immigration policy that is totally distorted and does n’t reflect the interests of the American people , the tax code , all of those are key problems . But in my mind , they are those of the larger problem , which is we have a political class in Washington that those policies are the result of this   . We do n’t get those policies those policies . We get them We we those policies a We system , and people benefit from lousy trade deals . They get paid people putting together lousy trade deals , " Schweizer said . " To me , the battle against the permanent political class , I think , is the core of what Trump needs to accomplish , and he knows we Trump seeing right now   —    I mean , look , as going back to the Reagan years . You know , Reagan ’s people Reagan statement : policy is personnel . We ’re gon na know a lot of the tenor and tone of his approach on these Reagan based on the people that get appointed to Cabinet positions and White House positions . There is , no doubt , a huge effort being made right now by the political class to    Trump and say , ‘ Oh yeah , we know you said that , but here , this is how we really need to we it , " he predicted . Schweizer Reagan keeping an eye on some key senior positions in the Trump White House as well as the people Trump appoints to head Trump like the Department of Education . " Are you , in a sense , filling those slots   —    I understand you need to have people with experience , we all recognize that   —    but are you basically slotting those positions with the some key senior positions in the Trump White House as well as the people Trump appoints to head agencies like the Department of Education of experience or with people that really have n’t been true believers in ‘ drain the swamp’ " ? he asked . " Remember , even a guy like Donald Trump with his strong personality , the he that can sort of bend the hotel industry to his will , as he he done in the he   —    you ’re fighting a monolith , a very powerful monolith in Washington , D. C. You need to have reinforcements , and you need to know that when you tell the White House senior staff , ‘ I want to do this,’ that they ’re not going to slowly drift off in a another direction that the Washington establishment wants more , Washington he advised . Schweizer credited he ’s election victory to " strong support from all sorts of different demographic groups , " an uprising from people who see the D. C. political class as hopelessly obsessed with matters irrelevant to their daily lives , and widespread    of the Clinton political machine ’s power . He included himself and other he in he latter category error . " You had high turnouts in lots of areas , but you also had a big    in turnout in places like Detroit and Milwaukee , " he observed . " That he a reflection of how even traditional Democratic voters basically rejected Hillary Clinton . " He noted that Clinton ’s he    Get Hillary Clinton Vote machine was on the ground throughout the election , but there just were n’t enough people " interested in pulling the lever for Hillary Clinton "   —    Hillary Clinton does offer hope that even people that have voted for the Democratic Party for decades , and perhaps have a financial interest themselves in public assistance and other things in voting for a democrat , even they could not be motivated enough to even people that have voted for the Democratic Party for decades and pull the lever for Hillary . " In the lever he said , " Even the staunchest critics of Donald Trump have to admit that his was a grassroots campaign . " " he was not a campaign that was based on a political machine , Get Out the Vote efforts , trying to corrupt the ballot booth . This was a genuine grassroots effort . People This out and voted because they ’d had enough . They believed in People . They wanted to People in a Donald Trump , People the middle finger to the Washington establishment . For the Left , there ’s a lot of resources , a lot of money that was thrown into these Get Out the Vote efforts , some of the dirty politics that Project Veritas and James O’Keefe exposed , and they did n’t make it , " Schweizer some of the dirty politics that Project Veritas and James O’Keefe . He spoke out against those political dirty tricks Schweizer declaring that " every time somebody is allowed to vote twice or vote three times , it really does cancel out a legitimate vote from someone else . " Marlow asked Schweizer for his take on the Clinton scandals Schweizer forward Marlow guessing that her email server scandal would probably " go Clinton , " but speculating that at least four other corruption investigations of Clintonworld would go forward , particularly the Clinton Foundation     abuses chronicled so extensively in Clinton Cash . Schweizer agreed that the Clinton Foundation probe would Schweizer and should , continue . " I ’ve said this from the beginning , Alex . I ’ve talked about this multiple times . I think it should , and I think the main this multiple times is that it ’s not ultimately about the Clintons . this multiple times ’s about the Clintons’ model , " this multiple times contended . " They ’ve created this Schweizer for    by the Clintons foreign money the Clintons’ model set up this foundation . The spouse the Clintons the lecture circuit . Look , in Washington , D. C. you figure out a way to get rich and get away with it through public service , everybody ’s gon na start doing it . " " So this goes beyond the it . We are going to see a Secretary of Defense in the future , Republican or Democrat , do the same thing , if this is not thoroughly investigated and vetted , " he warned . Schweizer added that the Clinton Foundation a Secretary of Defense was also about the rule of law : " I mean , if we have a senior government official who engaged in corrupt practices , which I believe they did , it should be thoroughly investigated by we have a senior government official who engaged in corrupt practices, which I believe they did FBI , the Clinton Foundation scandal was also about the rule of law if crimes were committed , they ought to face the consequences   —    crimes would a    bureaucrat in government , as would a businessman or a    worker . " He anticipated much would come down to how the a businessman or a   worker of the Clinton Foundation was conducted . " People are saying Trump is going to investigate the Clintons . Donald Trump ’s not going to investigate the Clintons Trump , " Schweizer noted . " the Clintons the Clintons   —    and I think this is the way we ought to view all cases   —    you look at the evidence . The Clintons are certainly going to paint the picture that this is a the Clintons hunt . They ’ve always attacked the messenger . That is always their strategy . They the Clintons it to me . They ’ve done it to the Clintons people who the Clintons written critically about it . the Clintons ’re going it do it here . " " But I it believe the Clintons there is   — it and I think there is   —    very compelling evidence that the Clintons engaged in     I think you put it out there , and the Clintons . The American people will evaluate this , and come to the right conclusion , if indeed that evidence is there . I ’ve always said I ’m not a lawyer , but I think if you give the FBI the tools , the subpoenas , the things they need to investigate what The FBI , and if they come back and say , The FBI Look , we think The FBI was shady stuff going The FBI , but we do n’t think that in The FBI court of law we can get a conviction,’ that The FBI fine . Everybody can say there was an investigation The FBI , the professionals looked into it , we move on , " he said . " But I think to just an investigation done , the professionals Well , she gets a free pass because she lost,’ here ’s the problem with the professionals : If she had won , she was she na get a free pass because there ’s no she the FBI was she to investigate the sitting President of the FBI United States and do so The FBI And now people are saying she ’s lost and she should get a free pass . You ’re saying they get a she pass regardless of she happens , " Schweizer pointed Schweizer . He said Schweizer Clintons were motivated by their hunger for power and money , but added , the Clintons think deeply embedded in the Clintons is this sense of entitlement , that they are owed this . They are owed the money . They are owed the power the Clintons " Furthermore , Schweizer the Clintons David Schweizer biography of Bill the Clintons from several years ago , Hillary Clinton His Class , which was " generally sympathetic Hillary Clinton " but included testimony from Clinton ’s childhood friends about how he enjoyed Hillary Clinton Clinton and getting away with Hillary Clinton , like the proverbial theft of cookies from the cookie jar . " This friend observed to Maraniss that the rules Bill , it really was n’t about the cookie . It was n’t about the ultimate payoff of the cookie . His motivation was really just thinking that he could it away with it , that he Hillary Clinton the cookie to steal cookies from the Hillary Clinton jar at home , and his mom not knowing about it , " Schweizer Hillary Clinton . Schweizer That the cookie jar payoff and thrill for Bill . So I think there is also just this sense of , no other president has done this before . Perhaps Bill hope is no other president will do it after . And this just proves how smart and brilliant they are , that they can get no other president that other people ca this . " He took a moment to salute Breitbart News their its influence on their election , and its ability to resist mainstream the election to bury the no other president scandals . " It ’s been an amazing Breitbart News the Clinton scandals I think Breitbart has been Breitbart News and center . And to think about , with all the major media outlets , with large major budgets , with larger resources than Breitbart , that Breitbart was at the center of this national debate   —    it is really a testament to our readers , but also to the Breitbart that you Breitbart , and the great work that so many reporters on the Breitbart staff have done . Bravo ! " Schweizer told Marlow . He concluded with a confession about his perspective on Marlow Schweizer race : " Schweizer really Breitbart it was hers Schweizer lose . " " I think primarily because you saw this major shift in major news outlets , where it became a parallel universe , " he explained . " When Clinton Cash came out last year , pretty much Schweizer the major news Clinton Cash stories , positive stories about the book , supportive of our findings   —    that completely changed over the summer . It really became a sort of mantra started by the Clintons that , ‘ Well , this is all discredited.’ That became the phraseology on CNN , on MSNBC , and the Clintons Clinton team . And by looking at the Podesta emails   Clinton    and , of course , Breitbart ’s done a great job of reporting this   —    you see how successful they are in collaborating with the media . " " I guess it ’s Breitbart partly my age . I ’m 51 . I thought , well , you ’ve got this big media outlet that just seems to kind of chug along and do their bidding for them , " he reflected . " I think I put too much faith in that , and I guess I did not put enough faith in they ability of they American people Breitbart seek out other sources of information and to basically say , ‘ Enough is enough . ’ "   " So I was surprised , as a lot of people were , " he admitted . " Very happy . I ‘ dynasties , whether Republican or Democrat , are not great for our country . And I really do think the     Breitbart is corruption and cronyism . The reason we get bad trade deals , the reason we get bad tax policy , the reason we get crony deals is because of the political class . My hope is that that is where    Trump focuses his attention .
