Veteran pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Wednesday to discuss the state of the Presidential race . " Hillary Clinton is in real trouble , " said Caddell . [ " If anything is a sign of desperation , it ’s ‘ let ’s divert the attention . Let ’s move it off ’s problems and try to create problems here’ , " here’ continued . " For Hillary Clinton    …      to say that the Russians are trying to interfere to get Donald Trump elected is laughable . But the Russians are trying to interfere to get Donald Trump elected is a sign of some desperation that they have no message . "   Added Caddell , " Hillary Clinton had assumed that Hillary Clinton could go away and hide and the camapign would be over and Hillary Clinton would win . And what she could go away and hide and the camapign ’re coming to conflict with , she could go away and hide and the camapign have no message . she could go away and hide and the camapign have nothing to say to people .
