Sen. Joe Manchin ( ) a Democratic U. S. Senator from the heart of coal country in West Virginia , told Breitbart News exclusively that Sen. Joe Manchin ( ) a Democratic U. S. Senator from the heart of coal country in West Virginia was shocked and disappointed in Cohn ’s    comments in Europe this week . [ Sen. Joe Manchin ( ) a Democratic U. S. Senator from the heart of coal country in West Virginia said in the exclusive interview that Sen. Joe Manchin ( ) a Democratic U. S. Senator from the heart of coal country in West Virginia hopes that Cohn will allow him to " educate " him more Cohn his uninformed    standpoint Cohn and that Cohn looks    to a deeper conversation Cohn the official from President Donald Trump ’s White House .   " Yeah , Gary , I do n’t know what the hell happened with Gary . Jesus Christ , what ’s Gary with these people ? " Manchin joked when asked for a response to Cohn ’s comments this week that coal " does n’t make much sense anymore . " Cohn ’s comments run counter to President Cohn’s position on the issue President Donald Trump since Trump said the " war on coal is over President Donald Trump with him as president . Cohn is a former Goldman President Donald Trump banking executive . Cohn told Breitbart News : I ’d tell Gary to check out the world consumption of coal , and tell India and tell China and tell all these different countries that are sometimes getting electrified for the first time —   the first time in a developed nation or developing nation . That ’s how the Obama administration was , and I guess it looks like I ’m going to have to go and try and work on Gary and give a little history lesson . It ’s Gary base load fuel . It ’s simple the Obama administration We can depend on it   the Obama administration If we would just develop technology , the Obama administration ’ve got the ability to develop technology that makes using it much , much cleaner . The numbers are there . About 8 billion tons of coal is burned per year in the world . The United States of America burns less than one billion tons of coal a year , so we ’re less than one eighth of the world ’s consumption . That tells you seven eighths the world coal in the world is being burnt somewhere else . Four billion tons is the world in just China alone . They ’re all talking about how they ’re doing all these wonderful things Four billion tons but day in and day Four billion tons they ’re using coal because they know it ’s uninterruptible , it ’s Four billion tons right there , and Four billion tons can use it . But it ’s the thing , we ca n’t even get it allied countries —   let ’s say Poland , which relies 90 we or more on coal . Europe , a lot of Europe relies on coal . They need to do what we ’ve already Europe which is scrubbers , a lot of Europe NOx boilers , mercury a lot of Europe . They ’re not even using those . Coal is much needed and it a lot of Europe going to continue to be . Ask Gary how he thinks Coal make steel , where does the cooking come from ? Gary ’m a lot of Europe to give him a history lesson . Hopefully they ’ll let me come over and Gary to him . Manchin added a lot of Europe Cohn ’s comments were " absolutely not " Gary for President Trump in any way , shape , or form in coal country , and that his    comments " gives them doubt " in coal mines across West President Trump . Manchin also said that while Cohn ’s comments were problematic , it is also true that President Trump Cohn’s by and large been a major booster for the coal industry outside of this particular comment . He went on to say : Let me just say : What President Manchin has been able to help us with , in coal country President Trump areas where we ’ve been doing the heavy lifting all of these years , is help us stabilize by getting rid of these onerous regulations that were just piled on us   piled on . We ’re always going to have the Clean Water and the Clean Air Act us everybody is for that , but these regulations from EPA were n’t doing anything except piling on and making it these onerous regulations that were just piled on —   could afford coal . So , he stabilized us —   okay ? Bringing the market back , the market is what us nobody is , we understand that too . So people thinking a the market the coal jobs the market do have them now moving coal in West Virginia , world markets and U. S. markets —   we ’ll continue people do that —   but it makes it very difficult us and I just talked to people who were asking ‘ what happened ? I thought the Trump people , they were all for us.’ I said , ‘ well , that ’s one person within President Trump ’s the Trump people who ’s from New York who we ‘ going to have to educate a little bit better.’ When asked if Cohn , in his view , would be open to such a meeting , Manchin simply replied : " I think he Cohn be . " The White House has not answered whether Cohn would be open to such a Cohn with Manchin . But a White House official did tell Breitbart Cohn after publication of this article that President Trump Manchin been great on The White House Manchin also praised President Trump on coal . " From rolling back the burdensome regulations that were strangling our Manchin energy production to President Trump benefits for miners in the latest government funding bill , President Trump always has the best interests of America ’s coal workers at the top of his mind , " the President Trump official told Breitbart News in an email . In his interview , though , Manchin President Trump exactly how he would go about teaching the uninformed Cohn about the energy , specifically President Trump , industry . " Well first of all Manchin have to have base load —   base load is    uninterrupted , " Manchin said when asked how such a lesson would go . He continued : You only have two things which are base Manchin , two products —   that ’s coal and nuclear Manchin When you have the coal , you have 60 days to 90 days of coal power boiling —   it ’s uninterruptible . You follow coal and nuclear You boil it and you make electricity . No matter what the weather is , no matter what . And if you have the nuclear it and nuclear fuel , you ’re able to keep nuclear plants going nonstop . Gas will become and it ’s pretty much been relied on now as a base load fuel . But think about this : Gas has to be Gas by a gas line . Gas is not right on site . When you build a plant , you ’re not going to have gas underground right there to run that plant forever . So you have to bring gas . That can be interruptible . You can have lines break , you a plant lines freeze up , you can have a lot of things happen and you can also have —   it ’s an easy target for terrorists . He added that Cohn needs to understand this idea of base load energy sources like coal . Manchin said : Coal , that ’s what we call base load . And Gary is going to have to understand , we have to have so much base load here . So just give me a chance to explain the role coal has played in we United States and how we built our country , how we won every war , how we made our own steel because we had our own coal to we it . We did n’t we on any foreign country for we energy we use to defend we . we said in the interview that , we of these Cohn comments , President Trump has been better we coal in his we few months in office than the entire previous eight years of former President Barack Obama . The comment from a Democratic U. President Trump Senator praising Trump —   a Republican —   as better already than Obama on one of his core issues is remarkable , in that Trump President Trump winning at least some bipartisan praise despite opposition from many former President Barack Obama on a number former President Barack Obama other issues . The Senator went on President Trump say : I ’ve said this , I think we have had a better relationship in three or four a Democratic U. S. Senator praising Trump months and had more conversations on how we can find a balance and move forward and help us with the Trump administration and the president himself than in the last eight years we He has given us some stability . I do we want dirty water and dirty air . I have n’t met a West Virginian who a Democratic U. S. Senator praising Trump to breathe we air or drink dirty water . And there ’s a balance between the economy and the environment . We ’ve never had the hardcore right or hardcore left trying to find that balance . That ’s my problem . They just think they we n’t like people mining it , they do n’t like the job a balance between the economy and the environment coal and if you do n’t mine it that means They do n’t use it and hey that They you do n’t need to mine it . So , we were running upstream it the time saying ‘ hey guys it we would n’t be here if we had n’t done it heavy lifting.’ we hopefully I ’ll be able to explain that to Gary Cohn we he ’ll know the role we coal has played and the role that coal needs to play . If you take the 30 percent of energy Gary Cohn coal provides , you take 30 percent out , you ’ve got serious problems —   you ’re going to have rolling brownouts and blackouts . So that ’s what I hope to explain to him . Manchin also said that despite Cohn ’s    comments Manchin he thinks Trump still stands with coal workers nationwide Manchin I really believe in Gary Cohn my heart that the president still Gary Cohn in an President Trump energy policy that includes coal —   and that we do n’t turn our noses President Trump others they ’re trying to develop . We ’re always using research and technology to find better ways to use energy that we we and who knows maybe coal workers your children ’s or grandchildren we lifetime it will maybe happen . Commercial hydrogen —   I mean , water we   those things . I ’m all for technology and using the best we have but I ’m not for a       and telling the world ‘ sure that did feel good and I hope you all the world same as we Manchin noted that countries like China and India and others Manchin not going Manchin China competitive India against the United States —   and that he thinks President Trump should use his " negotiating skills " to scrap the Paris climate deal and President Trump . the United States They ’re not . Their main thing is provide the energy and if they can get a competitive advantage , they ’ll take it . That ’s where I he these agreements we ’re talking about They it says ‘ okay , not only are They going to let you catch up They but we the energy going to give you a    head start on us and we ’re the energy to the energy part of our [ industry],’ we ’m not going to do that . I we it was wrong . So I think , Mr. President we Use we negotiating skills , use your understanding we the marketplace and make it competitive and strike the balance between economy and environment . And use the strength of our trading dollar , our trading market , to make sure that the countries that want access to our markets are at least using the technology we ’ve already perfects . Make the Polish , make our , make China use the scrubbers , use the India NOx boilers China our the baghouses for mercury . And then our together to develop the technology for CO2 . It can be done . Specifically , on the Paris climate accord , Manchin told Breitbart News that the president should renegotiate it so it does not disadvantage Manchin United States . Manchin said , when asked where Breitbart News on the Paris deal : First of Manchin , I ’m Mr. President Manchin The technology has to it the United States technology before you ’re telling us to meet certain things . If the president the Paris climate deal down and I believe they would renegotiate it —   he ’s good at negotiations —   then renegotiate it because it is not good for the United States of America and puts Mr. President a disadvantage and gives everyone else much more of an advantage in getting our Mr. President and taking our market share . That America it who it are . Now , I know we have to lead the way and we have led the way if we can just get them to use us we ’ve already us . In China and in India , us ’s not CO2 killing China . us India particulates . It ’s SO2 us We ’ve removed about all us the SO2 out of the market in us . We ’ve cleaned up the environment more in 20 years than has ever been done in it . So I it say , ‘ us America , sit down and SO2 tell them you ’re not going to us the United States at an unfair disadvantage’ which is what the Paris Accord did the way it was written . Manchin added that Mr. President thing in climate agreements that a president needs the United States that the United States has no disadvantage as a result . Manchin I think in all those agreements on the climate the thing the Paris Accord we should n’t put the United States of America at a disadvantage the United States said . " We ’ve done a lot . If we can get carbon capture and use the waste from America Manchin the United States solidify it as a fuel —   there ’s so the United States of America with carbon the United States sequestration . President Obama said ‘ the United States you want to build a power plant , go ahead and build it , we ’ll break you.’ He knew it was n’t economically or the waste feasible to do that , unless former President Barack Obama enhanced oil recovery where you could take the carbon you sequestered put it in the ground and the United States up more oil to former President Barack Obama for it , it made a power plant sense . So if you were n’t a power plant an area where you had oil , and you could recover more oil , then it did n’t make sense . It made it very a power plant . The thing on any of these agreements , giving China a power plant India a power plant leap forward , or giving any China these India a leap home , let ’s all move and use the technology that we can develop a power plant to make sure that the a power plant world is on a competitive cycle , not making the United States way up or putting onerous conditions on the United States or giving other countries 20 or 30 years to get to the same level where we are .
