Sunday on CNN ’s " State of the Union , " Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s son Donald Trump , Jr. said Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) can only win the Republican presidential nomination by " bribing the delegates . "   While discussing the delegate system , Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said , " I think we ’re going to do what we need to do at a point . we want to win without having to do that . You know Sen. Ted Cruz has no chance of winning this without bribing the the delegates That ’s his Sen. Ted Cruz at this point . He Sen. Ted Cruz mathematically eliminated but that ’s his Sen. Ted Cruz day one he Sen. Ted Cruz not appealing to the voters . He Sen. Ted Cruz lose more states than Mitt Romney . I ca n’t name a single state that Mitt lost that Ted can possibly win . So I think at this point the Republican establishment would much rather just hand the things over to Hillary , hand the reins over to her and Hillary her run Hillary . the Republican establishment what ? There ’s no accountability in the party . You lose , it does n’t matter . You win , okay , great , you win . because everyone ’s in on the same thing . all their job everyone to do is to protect the little cliques they formed everyone keep the paychecks rolling from special interests and the same thing with the delegate process we ’re seeing today .
