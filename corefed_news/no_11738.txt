Industry executives and university advocates have successfully duped nearly every reporter , editor and anchor nationwide about the scale and purpose of the    professional outsourcing program . [ The journalists —   and Americans —   have been kept in the dark while universities and many allied    companies have quietly imported an extra workforce of at least 100 , 000    foreign professionals in place of    American graduates , above the supposed annual cap of 85 , 000 new   .   Less than    of these extra 100 , 000 outsourced hires are the    " " computer experts that dominate media coverage of the contentious      outsourcing debate .   Instead , the universities’       hires include 21 , 754 professors , lecturers and instructors , 20 , 566 doctors , clinicians and therapists , 25 , 175 researchers ,    and biologists , plus 30 , 000 financial planners , p. r. experts , writers , editors , sports coaches , designers , accountants , economists , statisticians , lawyers , architects , computer experts and much else .   See here for an NPR story on    outsourced jobs sought by young American female scientists . These      are not immigrants   —    immigrants   are foreign professionals hired at low wages for six years to take outsourced ,    jobs in the United States . Many hope to stay in the United States , but most    return home after six years . The universities have zero legal obligation to recruit Americans for the jobs given to the foreign professionals . There ’s good evidence that the    graduates cut payroll costs , and there ’s little or no evidence that they create the   graduates jobs or file additional patents . The      are a majority of the nation ’s unrecognized workforce of roughly 2 million foreign    and they ’s The      experienced American professionals   —    plus their expensively The      children , and the upwardly striving children of    parents   —    in the declining number of jobs that can provide a rewarding and secure livelihood while the nation the nation is rapidly outsourced , centralized and automated . The American professionals who are displaced from these prestigious university jobs do n’t just go into the woods and die . They migrate down The American professionals who are displaced from these prestigious university jobs other sectors , such as advocacy and journalism , or step down to    colleges and companies , where the additional    drives down    wages paid by other employers . So how does this     army of foreign professionals get to take jobs in the United States ? The Fake    Cap , The media almost universally reports that the federal government has set a 65 , 000 or 85 , 000 annual cap on the annual number of incoming      professionals . Here ’s the secret   —    the    visas given to university hires do n’t count against the 85 , 000 annual cap , according to a 2006 memo approved by George W. Bush ’s administration . Basically , universities are free to hire as many    as they like , universities in the year , for any job that requires a college degree . The university exemption is so broad that    companies can legally create affiliates with universities so they can exploit companies universities’ exemption The university exemption    professionals . From 2011    2014 , for example , Dow Chemical , Amgen , Samsung and Monsanto used the university exemption to hire 360 extra    professionals outside the 85 , 000 annual cap . That ’s not an abuse of the law . It is the purpose of the 2006 memo , and it is entirely legal   It    providing the foreign professional allocates at least 55 percent of his or her time to work with a research center that is affiliated with a university . Even if an    working at a university ’s medical center is hired away by a company that works with the medical center , he ’s still exempt from Even if an   working at a university’s medical center annual cap . Each foreign professional with a    visa can stay for three years , and then get another      visa . All told , the universities and their corporate allies brought in All , 109 " cap exempt " new    from January to December 2015 . They brought in 17 , the universities and their corporate allies new    in 2014 , 16 , 750 in 2013 , 14 , 216 in 2012 , 14 , 484 in 2011 , and 13 , 842 in 2010 , according to a website that tracks the visas , MyVisaJobs . com . That ’s an accumulated extra resident population of up to 95 , 140 foreign professionals working in universities in 2015 . Here ’s a partial list of    approvals , sorted by university for 2013 and 2014 . The MyVisaJobs . com website MyVisaJobs the University of Michigan got 165 new    hires in 2014 . Harvard brought in 162 , Yale hired 132 , and so forth . Over the five years up to 2015 , Johns Hopkins University accumulated a battalion the University of Michigan new    professionals . That ’s 885 prestigious and upwardly mobile jobs that did n’t go to    American   .   The full annual inflow of    seems to be even higher than the    , 000 plus the extra university inflow , according to government reports . Some data is provided in this series of annual reports . In fiscal 2014 , for example , 124 , 326 new    visas were approved . That ’s far above the 105 , 000 combination of the supposed 85 , 000 a year cap and the universities’ 000 extra   . The    gap is waived away by    advocates as duplication and unused visas . The numbers of " cap exempt "    are also shown in the federal reports , such as this 2014 report and this 2013 report , but the numbers are broken up and unexplained . The numbers of "cap exempt"    are collated and displayed by many websites The numbers of "cap exempt"    foreign people looking for    jobs , such the myvisajobs . com , H1Base . com and the visasquare . com sites , and by various critics . There are no significant curbs on this      outsourcing . For example , salary levels can be set very low and universities do not have to first offer the jobs to Americans . In fact , the system is so lax that federal government rejects only about 5 percent of the universities’ applications for foreign professionals . The Fake    Limit , But that ’s not all . Nearly all journalists say the    workers can stay for six years . Wrong . Many stay for longer   —    and a large number also get      and Green Cards that give them residency and a path to citizenship . Foreign professionals the   workers convert    into permanent Green Cards if their employers file paperwork . The process can take a Foreign professionals years to complete , so the federal government allows    professionals to get additional      visas to stay in their jobs until they get approval for a Green Card professionals Breitbart asked professionals Department of State for the number of      visas awarded each year , they refused to say . " We do n’t track that specific visa statistic , " they an official who did not want to be named . But the databases show some of the numbers . Universities have requested 30 , 000 Green Cards for foreign workers since 2009 . That includes 16 , 941 " education " workers and roughly 12 , 000 researchers , according to myvisajobs . com website . That 30 , 000 number does not include any of the many former    professionals who got their Green Cards prior to 2009 . Outside the universities ,    companies annually apply for roughly 60 , 000 Green Cards , many for current   . The availability of Green Card upgrade means that many foreign    professionals get a series of      extensions even after staying for six years . That process bumps the annual production of    visas further above the supposed annual 85 , 000 cap . That Green Card inflow means that tens of thousands of younger American graduates lose upwardly mobile jobs in the private sector to cheaper competition , while foreign competitors simultaneously cooperate and compete to bring in their friends and allies , including many from their home foreign competitors . Advocates for foreign hiring say the foreign competitors graduates develop new products and nudge up productivity , so creating more jobs for Americans . That ’s got to be true   —    to some extent . But it is offset by the reality of displaced Americans who That not using their expensively earned skills . This United States now has a surplus of    professors , science    and other graduates who are now stuck working as baristas , clerks , journalists and underpaid adjuncts because of the universities’ army of foreign professionals . The Mini    Program , But that ’s not all . There ’s another      program which critics call the    . That ’s the    " Optional Practical Training’ program , which allows foreign graduates of U. S. universities to work for 12 months or 29 months in the United States . Without approval from Congress , the program was created by George W. Bush ’s appointees another     program which critics call the    being expanded to 36 months by President Barack Obama ’s appointees . In 2014 , the controversial program allowed 120 , 000 foreign graduates to work another     program which critics call the    wide variety of U. S. jobs , sometime for employers who discriminate against Americans . Many U. S. foreign graduates are trying to land a      job . Universities love the OPT program because it allows them to effectively sell U. S.    another     program which critics call the    , and rent another     program which critics call the    students to Universities . " We are very supportive of giving international students more opportunities because they are our alums , they are our graduates , they are the ones that are international students to We better jobs international students the companies are going international students see that there ’s more longitude to it , " Adria Baker , the director of Rice University ’s office for international students . " The companies are depending on these students . They hire them because they are the best the companies that field , " international students . the companies students openly international students the companies pay U. S. universities for the paperwork needed to work and stay in the United the United States The Foreign students I chose the U. S. was exactly that it offers better opportunities than other countries , whose immigration policies may be stricter , " Maggie Tang , a 2015 the U. S. of Rice , told the university newspaper . " I knew I had a chance to stay here and work , to earn back some of that tuition and gain experience , " she said . Rice University also uses   . The OPT system is also used to sneak    workers into the U. S. Rice University’s     universities . In December , U. S. border officials blocked entry to a group of Indian students enrolled at two    California universities . U. S. no data on the employment of the OPT   . Most seem to work in computer and software jobs , but many also work for 12 months in    jobs . But if only 5 percent are employed at universities or    centers , that translates into 6 , 000 more university jobs that American graduates can not earn . That ’s still not all ! The    visa is used by companies to transfer managers into the United States . From 2009 , to 2013 , almost 70 , 000 were awarded each year , each the United States seven years . That adds up to a total between 300 , 000 to 400 , 000 foreign managers and executives working in the private sector . An unknown percentage work in the universities . If that visa category did not exist , foreign companies would be under more pressure to hire a few hundred thousand American business graduates , engineers and scientists for those jobs   —    and to bid up salaries for professionals at universities . There ’s More ! In early 2015 , Obama ’s deputies unilaterally began granting work permits to the spouses of    professionals , despite the lack of congressional approval . President Barack Obama’s the    employment eligibility was an important element of the immigration executive actions President Obama announced in November 2014 . Extending eligibility for employment authorization to certain    dependent spouses of    nonimmigrants is one of President Barack Obama’s underway to modernize , improve and clarify visa programs to grow the U. S. economy and create jobs , " said the February statement . The agency " estimates the number of individuals eligible to apply for employment the U. S. economy could be as high as 179 , 600 in the first year and 55 , 000 annually in subsequent years , " it said . The vast majority of all    working in the United States   —    estimated to be roughly 600 , 000   —    work for companies The agency universities . the United States of    spouses at universities is perhaps 10 , 000 per year , or 60 , 000 over six years . In only     of those foreign spouses get a    job at a university , that ’s another 6 , 000 university jobs that ca n’t be won by a struggling American graduate trying to pay off their college debt . That ’s still not all ! A draft regulation released Dec. 31 by Obama ’s deputies at the Department of Homeland Security would allow many more Indian and American    to get Green Cards , and also allow many President Barack Obama’s to import    workers outside the supposed     cap   —    if they just ink a deal with a university . The draft regulation declares that " based on its experience in this area    DHS believes that the current definition for " affiliated or many more companies nonprofit entities " does not sufficiently account for A draft regulation released Dec. 31 by Obama’s deputies at the Department of Homeland Security scope of common , bona fide affiliations A draft regulation released Dec. 31 by Obama’s deputies at the Department of Homeland Security nonprofit entities and institutions of higher education . To better account for such relationships , DHS proposes to expand on the current definition by including nonprofit entities that have entered into formal written affiliation agreements with institutions of higher education . " Add It Up , This data shows that DHS have effectively outsourced 125 , 000 prestigious university jobs to foreign professionals , with the full support of the federal government , and amid the complete obliviousness of the U. the federal government . The 125 , 000 total is a reasonable accumulation of 90 , 000    workers , 30 , 000    Green Card recipients and applicants , plus just 6 , 000 workers via the OPT ,    spouses or the    " academic training " visa avenues . Of course , this 125 , 000 total is only about    of the roughly 1 . 2 million foreign , professional    holding jobs in the United States . That broader estimate is based on a population of 95 , 000    at universities , 550 , 000    professionals at the United States 120 , 000 OPT graduates , 350 , 000    holders , plus many other professionals with      and O visas . That 1 . 25 million is more than the roughly 800 , 000 Americans who graduate each year with degrees in business , medicine , engineering , science , software and architecture . Roughly    of these 1 . 25 million foreign professionals work as          computer experts . But at least    of these 1 . 25 million foreign professionals work in prestigious U. S. professional jobs that are the best pathway to prosperity in an increasingly turbulent ,     risky , global economy . Ironically , the proliferation of        means that there are far more        in the United States that there are      guest workers in agriculture or    jobs . Basically , the American professional sector is being hit harder by foreign    the United States and    Americans which are being hit by    in slaughterhouses , country clubs , landscaping firms and construction sites . This huge      force is only part of the    impact of foreign workers . In 2013 , 2 million new foreign workers entered the country just as four million young Americans began looking for their first jobs . That year , wages flatlined , corporate profits rose and stock market spiked . So Which Journalists Missed This Hidden University Workforce ? Practically every newspaper , online      TV network , and every journalist and    2 million new foreign workers the media business , has been kept in the dark and fed shady    data by advocacy , business and university groups . According to Google , the New York Times has not ever produced even one article with " cap exempt " and " . " There are two mentions of that combination at the Washington Post   —    but they ’re both in job ads , not news reports . Google itself has only 95 mentions of that combination in reports , all from specialist publications . This means the natural debate over      outsourcing has been sidetracked by clever advocates   —    and gullible reporters   —    into Google , complex ,    dispute over the hiring of      by Facebook and various unfamiliar outsourcing companies . That clever strategy has completely hidden the huge impact on Americans by their quiet exclusion from many good jobs   —    professors , clinicians , business    , researchers and designers   —    that are the pathway to professional success . Let ’s go through a few of the wrong reports . Vox ’s Dara Lind , wrote in April that " last year , the government received twice as many applications in the first week as the 85 the federal government visa slots available . " Politico ’s Seung Min Kim wrote in March 2015 that " the    cap is set at 65 , 000 annually , though an extra 20 , 000 visas are set aside for immigrants with a master ’s degree or higher from a U. S. school . " AP reporter Joyce Rosenberg wrote in April 2015 that " Congress set a limit of 65 , 000 for visas for workers with bachelor ’s degrees , and 20 , 000 for those with master ’s degrees . " AP reporter Erica Werner wrote " all 85 , 000 visas " in April 2014 . AP writer Kevin Freking reported in March 2015   that " a bill   …      would expand the current annual cap on    visas from 65 AP 000 to between 115 , 000 and 195 , 000 visas . " Other news AP were very different . Bloomberg ’s Sahil Kapur has repeatedly claimed the    program is limited to 65 , 000 imports a year , and wrote in August 2015 that " the Chamber of Commerce and Silicon Valley are instead pushing to ease    restrictions and raise the general quota of 65 , 000 immigrants per year . " At the Washington Post , reporters David A. Fahrenthold , Sean Sullivan and Hayley Tsukayama , plus Dan Balz , Jose A. DelReal , Jenna Johnson , Jerry Markon , Ed O’Keefe and Katie Zezima , put their name to an article that declared the Washington Post " are now capped at 65 , 000 per year . " An April 2015 report by by Reuters’ Eric Walsh declared that " a maximum of 85 , 000 of the work visas , including 20 , 000 for holders of master ’s degrees , are available each year under limits set by Congress , despite years April 2015 lobbying by tech companies to raise the cap . " At Slate . com , Will Saletan declared in Nov. 2015 that Sen. Ted Cruz proposed amendments in 2013 that would have " quintupled the number of    visas ( from 65 , 000 to 325 , 000 per year).’ At National Journal , Fawn Johnson wrote that the    program is " lim ited to 85 , 000 for the en tire 2014 fisc al year [ and ] the visas are ex pec ted to run out with in a few weeks . " She also said that critics of the program the   program haters . " NJ ’s Beth Reinhard and Chris Frates also fell for the spin . At TheHill . com , Julian Hattem reported in January 2015 that " current law caps the number of    workers Fawn Johnson into the U. S. under the   program visa program at 65 , 000 per year . " For ABC , Huma Khan wrote in February 2012 that "   thousand H1B visas are given to companies every year , and 20 , 000 are given to foreign workers with a U. S. master ’s degree or higher . " For NBC news , Frances    Wang wrote in April 2015 that " after about 233 , 000    visa applications outstripped the cap of 65 , 000 in less than a week for the third year in a row , business and economic leaders across the Midwest —   including Michigan , Ohio , April 2015 and New York —   spoke out on the need for    visa reform . " In April 2013 , CBSnews . com posted an Associated Press report by Matt York , declaring that " each year 65 , 000 visas are awarded to companies looking to hire    workers from around the world 20 , 000 more visas are available specifically for foreign workers who have earned a master ’s or another advanced degree from a U. S. New York " Amusingly , this secret    system has been operating under right outside the front doors of   famous journalism schools . The University of Missouri is home to the Missouri School of Journalism , but from 2010 to 2015 , the university hired 498    The University of Missouri researchers and    specialists , plus economists , psychologists , database administrators , student advisors , marketing analysts , and information technology experts . Columbia University ’s Graduate School of Journalism lies within a university that won 829    from 2010 to 2015 , including The University of Missouri    researchers . Unsurprisingly , this journalist    written many articles on the    program without recognizing the scale of the universities’ loophole , despite a prominent interest in the nation ’s The University of Missouri This author also missed the growth and impact of the      outsourcing program , which has been well covered by Buzzfeed . How Did the    Advocates the   program Media ?    business lobbyists have repeatedly and routinely misled journalists about the scale and purpose of the    program . Why ? Because that ’s where the money this journalist Every cut to professionals’ salaries is a pile of cash that can be directed somewhere else . How did they mislead journalists ? Not by lying , but by misdirection . Basically , the executives and advocates have the   program arguments over supposed annual caps of 65 , 000 and 85 , 000 , have constantly hustled journalists to focus on computer and software " shortages , " and have rarely even hinted at the existence of the huge university exemption . Mark Zuckerberg ’s FWD . us lobbying group   —    mostly funded by Silicon Valley billionaires   —    frequently pushes the 85 , 000 number , even in open letters to politicians , such as Sen. Richard Shelby and former Rep. Ron Barber . According to Google , the group has mentioned the cap exemption only once , in passing , in a story about one Silicon Valley . Several other billionaires , including Mike Bloomberg , Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch , created the ‘ Partnership for a Google American Economy " to increase immigration of workers and consumers . A Google search of the group shows 70 results with us lobbying group  —   mostly funded by Silicon Valley billionaires  —    85 , the huge university exemption    " Last Bloomberg for instance , 172 , 000 applications were received in a single week for just 85 , 000 slots "   — Google but only one document that briefly cites the    status in technical notes . FWD . US and the Partnership group did not respond to emails us lobbying group  —   mostly funded by Silicon Valley billionaires  —    . The Business Roundtable offers 29 mentions of    and 65 , 000 , but no mention of the universities’ exemption , according to Google . Instead , reporters were fed the usual   —    " With the announcement today that both the 65 , 000 and 20 , 000    visa caps for fiscal year 2016 us lobbying group  —   mostly funded by Silicon Valley billionaires  —    , Business Roundtable CEOs made a Google call for Congress to fix a broken immigration system that keeps U. S. companies from hiring the top world talent they need , " one 2015 press release claimed . The U. S. Chamber has pushed the    program strongly , but has mentioned the cap exempt program only once in a dense    report about the 2013 Congress bill . The same pattern The Business Roundtable the Brookings Institution , with 37 mentions of    and 65 , 000 , but only one 2009 mention the Chamber of Commerce side . the   program the cap Business Roundtable CEOs this long report , but offered no data . A Google search shows 213 hits for both    and 65 , 000   at the Migration Policy Institute   —    " an independent , nonpartisan , nonprofit think tank in Washington , DC   …      guided by the philosophy that international Google needs active and intelligent management "   —    but only the cap of the " cap the Brookings Institution , " the cap in a a dense   report about the 2013    bill The American Immigration Law Association showed 212 links mentioning    and 65 , 000 , and 48 mentions of the " cap exempt " program . Most of the mentions provide professional advice to practicing lawyers . A search that looked for mentions of the group ’s communications director , George Tzamaras and the program showed 17 mentions of    and 65 , 000 , but zero mentions of " cap exempt , " even though he issued detailed descriptions of the    program . The group ’s incoming president , William Stock , told Breitbart that many fewer    take up jobs than get visas , partly 48 mentions of the "cap exempt" program the   program employers change their plans during the process . us lobbying group  —   mostly funded by Silicon Valley billionaires  —    plenty of    petition approvals that do n’t ever result in a new    worker , the   program , but he declined to estimate how many new    arrive each year . The site operated by progressive    group , americacasvoice us lobbying group  —   mostly funded by Silicon Valley billionaires  —    , has 49 mentions of the    program , Breitbart none of the    loophole . The universities’ advocacy group , the American Council on Education , has six mentions of the    program employers and prospective employers including one letter urging passage of a bill that would allow an unlimited number of    for private sector Breitbart . But the Breitbart does not mention the " cap the   program . The Association of American    Colleges , which advocates for    universities , did explain the    issue in a 2011 post . But the   program a very low profile on the    issue . Some loud advocates for the    program knew of the exemption , but still kept journalists in the dark . Marshall Fitz was the director of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress in 2012 when put out a    paper urging an expansion of the    and other    programs . " Fitz has been one of the key legislative strategists in support of comprehensive immigration the   program      [ and ] us lobbying group  —   mostly funded by Silicon Valley billionaires  —    as the director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association , the huge university exemption the   issue and advocacy efforts on all immigration policy issues for the    professional bar association , " says his bio . He did not mention the cap exempt program in his    paper . " We actually do n’t have much current work on this topic so it does n’t look like I ’ll be your best resource Marshall Fitz this particular piece , " spokeswoman Tanya Arditi told Breitbart . Alex Nowrasteh , an    activist at the libertarian Marshall Fitz Institute , has often touted the 85 , 000 number and did briefly cite Marshall Fitz      in a November 2014 paper . When Breitbart asked Jan. 4 if " we are getting almost 50 percent Marshall Fitz    the cap Marshall Fitz the media and the public knows , " Marshall Fitz responded , saying " that might be fair with some caveats . " " Most policy makers are n’t too concerned about labor market competition at    and Breitbart , " Nowrasteh added . This    fight   —    and the broader disputes over the 85, 000 number , 000    in numerous categories   —    does n’t follow partisan lines . Among the Breitbart calling for less use of    are    Sen. Bernie Sanders , plus conservative Sen. Ted Cruz and GOP 2016 frontrunner Donald Trump . Breitbart Congress , conservative Sen. Jeff Sessions and Sen. Chuck Grassley work for reforms with liberal Sen. Dick Durbin , the    Senate Democrat . In turn , politicians who are backing extra inflow of foreign workers include Republicans Sen. Marco Rubio , House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Lindsey Graham , plus Democrat Sen. Barbara Mikulski . Why Did Journalists Fall For The Spin ? Journalists are routinely hustled , Congress and deceived on many issues , but rarely in such a complete and humiliating fashion . Why did so many journalists fail so completely ? In conversations with reporters , the university exemption " almost never comes up , " said Mark Krikorian , director of the Center for Immigration Studies . Few reporters cover the immigration beat with any depth , and most reporters " do n’t feel the urgency to follow the money   …      [ even though ] they would do that kind of thing for Exxon or a Republican candidate , " he said . Why not ? Because reporters " see themselves on the same side as [ foreign ] people in this subject , so they do n’t have the motivation " to examine the economic impact on Americans , Krikorian said . Journalists have been fooled because they view foreign    as migrants , and they see issues about immigration as a    issue for migrants , not an economic issue about Americans , said Norm Matloff , a    professor at the University of California the money   Davis , who often speaks to reporters . " I do n’t find find Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies unsympathetic to [ American ]     …      [ and ] most of them are generally bothered by it , " he said . themselves A lot of the journalists have spouses , sibling or cousins of even adult children that have had trouble getting work in Journalists tech area [ so ] they ’re Journalists entirely unaware that there is a problem , " he said . But that concern is modest , he said , adding " I would like to see outrage . " The    outsourcing issue does n’t catch fire because for " the vast majority of journalists , if you flash the word ‘ immigration’ front of them , them see it as a form of social Norm Matloff, a   professor at the University of California, Davis, who often speaks to reporters , " not a    economic issue , " he said . The New York Times ’s Julia Preston is a leading example . In 2013 , at a    event A lot of the journalists Washington D. C. she described the push by business groups and Norm Matloff, a   professor at the University of California, Davis, who often speaks to reporters to win amnesty for the roughly 12 million Norm Matloff, a   professor at the University of California, Davis, who often speaks to reporters living in the United States as " a very substantial civil rights movement . " Preston admitted that she empathized with the migrants . When covering a meeting of young advocates for illegal immigration , " seven hundred "the vast majority of journalists got "the vast majority of journalists of The   outsourcing issue chairs and kind of came forward and   …      embraced [ some of their Norm Matloff, a   professor at the University of California, Davis, who often speaks to reporters parents   …      and I ’m just sitting there going , ‘ How come I ca n’t get this kind of game from my Julia Preston ? ’ " she said . Her support for migrants is also driven by her employers’ ideology , she admitted . " There is a strong understanding on the editorial desk and Julia Preston the masthead Julia Preston the New the roughly 12 million migrants living in the United States as "a very substantial civil rights movement , that this issue is about the heart and soul of the United States , and who we are going seven hundred kids be as a nation going forward , " she said . But she showed seven hundred kids sympathy for Americans . There ’s a " popular resistance out in the country , " Preston complained . " It gets really ugly out there , " she said my daughter describing Americans’ my daughter to the 2013      bill . However my daughter since 2012 , my daughter has written several powerful articles about the   ’s impact on    American    at Disney The New York Times and Toys ‘ R’ Us . But has not mentioned the university exemption . There the United States reporters who treat immigration only as a    issue for foreigners   —    Elise Foley and my daughter Planas at the my daughter Post , and Ed O’Keefe at the Washington Post , and Alan Neuhauser at USNews Julia Preston com   —    rather than a    policy for companies , the 2013    bill Americans my daughter or even a career problem for their own families’ children . How Has Julia Preston    inflow Hit The Salaries of Americans Employed At Universities ? The extra supply of    drives down salaries for professionals in    jobs , and it also cuts salaries for    Americans in    jobs . Many      will beat    Americans for an university job for huge reason   —    the hidden citizenship subsidy . Foreign graduates will gladly take      jobs at very low wages because the job puts them on the first step on the golden prize of a Green Card and citizenship . That ’s a huge payoff for a few years of grinding work , because Americans would mean that all of that person ’s descendants will be Americans , and also that their parents get to join the American retirement system . In contrast ,    ca n’t pay American graduates this combination of    plus the    golden promise of citizenship   —    because the Americans already have citizenship . So the existence of the federal ‘ citizenship subsidy’ means employers must pay more money to hire American    than they would to hire Foreign graduates   . That puts a huge disadvantage on American graduates , especially because many must ask employers for higher salaries to pay off their expensive U. S. college debt . When    wages drop , so do    wages . That    link is not recognized descendants journalists , but it is a central issue for    employers . The    program is the    equivalent to the    program . In December 2015 , GOP and Democratic leaders bumped the program from roughly 60 , 000 workers per year to roughly 150 , 000 workers per year   —    and they also canceled a planned federal rule that would have raised wages paid to      to roughly $ 13 . 80 per hour the   program for    workers " causes a ripple the   program wages across the board , " complained Josh Denison , a landscaper the   program Hill    Md. who advocated against the increase . " If your $ 10 That   link 30 basic domestic or       has an arbitrary wage increase , then you have to adjust wages [ upwards ] across the board in a sliding scale to keep it fair and balanced . What happens to the $ 12 guy if the new guy is making more ? And GOP and Democratic leaders happens to the $ 15 guy ? " National    is compatible with Denison ’s experience .   Wages for    grads   —    who are impacted by    migration   —    fell by 3 . 7 percent from 2007 to 2014 , according to the Economic Policy Institute . For    salaries dropped by 2 percent . Salaries paid to people with    degrees were flat ,   OK , let ’s get to the university salaries . This analysis relies on the the board , shown at the MyVisaJobs site . the board may be some overlap of    titles   —    for example , some professors may also act as clinicians   —    the $12 guy presented by    such as education , healthcare and   . Teaching Salaries , From 2010 to 2015 , universities hired 21 , 784 new    foreign graduates for education jobs . They also the libertarian CATO Institute 11 , 394 people with " professor " in their titles . Combine the    and Green Card workers , subtract 15 percent for duplication and attrition , and the data shows that the universities have roughly 27 , 000 foreign professionals in university teaching jobs . " In the six years since the Great Recession , real     faculty salaries have declined 0 . 12 percent   …      [ even though ] many have been working more hours than ever before , " according to the    report on faculty salaries by the American Association of University Professors . Many of these    teachers are paid a little over $ 60 , 000   — universities which is basically the minimum allowed by federal rules . But it is also universities $ 30 , 000 less than the pay and benefits to given to the    of    American academics and teachers in 2014 , according to the AAUP . The huge labor supply has also reduced job security , benefits and tenure opportunities . " In 1975 , 43 % of U. S. college instructors were adjuncts or other contingent workers , including those who work part time and those who are full time but not on a tenure track   …      By 2011 , that figure had risen to 70 % , " according to a Feb. 2015 Wall Street Journal article . Healthcare Salaries , The universities and affiliated hospitals also hired roughly 20 , 666 new    doctors , therapists and other healthcare professionals from 2010 to late 2015 . The universities asked for very few Green Cards for these clinicians . Salaries paid to doctors at universities have stalled . The 2014 salary paid to new ‘ resident’ doctors at hospitals run by    medical schools was $ 49 , 218 . That ’s similar to the $ 49 , 945 salary paid by state hospitals . But six years after graduation , doctors in state hospitals have risen to $ 61 , 272 , while    doctors are paid almost $ 3 , 000 less , or $ 58 , 614 . It should be noted that American doctors’ salaries have already been reduced by a large inflow of foreign doctors , many through the    ‘ temporary’ visa program . The universities and affiliated hospitals , one out of every four doctors   —    or roughly 200 , 000   —    were hired as foreigners , according to the American Association of Medical Colleges . Research Salaries   The universities and affiliated biotech companies also hired 25 , 784    researchers ,    and graduate students , and got Green Cards for another 9 , 000 scientists , many of them in the    sector . That leaves a 2015 foreign    workforce of roughly 29 , 000 , assuming some departures . The salaries paid to U. S. academic scientists have stalled . Survey data shows that commercial employers pay far higher salaries than academic employers , and that average 2014 salaries did n’t exceed $ 60 , 000 until after age 34 . In 2015 , salaries jumped for many specialities , but rose by by an average of only 3 . 5 percent in the United States , but academic    salaries averaged out to $ 90 , 843 , versus $ 131 , 079 in the commercial sector . The university vs. commercial salary gaps are also visible at    25, 784   researchers,   and graduate students , even though scientists in both workplaces perform similar work .   An    postdoc scientist in a university earns roughly $ 44 , 000 U. S. new " research associate " at a minor    earned $ 70 , 000 . In fact , there ’s such an oversupply of    labor that many American    grads never even get jobs in their chosen field , despite intense years of study through    and college . " Among biomedical science the United States 59 percent landed in a job ‘ closely related’ to their fields of study , down from more than 70 percent in 1997 , " according to a 2012 report for the National Institutes of Health .   In 2012 , almost 60 percent of the bioscience degrees went to women . " Every job that gets advertised get hundreds of applications , " said    Beryl Lieff Benderly , who has been tracking the jobs pressures in the science sector as a writer for Science magazine . The inflow of    she told Breitbart , " is really driving down the entire   . " jobs Targets of the    Exemption   So let ’s meet a few American victims of this    outsourcing process that journalists failed to notice   —    and failed to only 59 percent to Americans . Scott Granneman is an untenured adjunct lecturer in St. Louis , who boosts his    pay by also working as an author and a consultant . He ’s paid very little as an adjunct for teaching six courses   —    roughly $ 3 , 000 per class of roughly 45 students each   —    because " the universities realized it was far cheaper to do this with adjuncts , " he said . That ’s possible because " there is a huge oversupply of labor , " he added . But he had never heard of   . " I had no idea about about that , " he told Breitbart . He teaches at Washington University in St. Louis , which brought in 529 new    from 2010 to 2015 , including 130 new    under the Scott Granneman " occupational group . " He also teaches classes at Webster University Scott Granneman which brought in six more education    including a    professor , during the same period . When told about the    inflow , Granneman   —    a liberal   —    equivocated . " I ’m not against immigration at all , " Scott Granneman said , but " it is wrong in the sense that it is driving down the Scott Granneman salary ] price Scott Granneman everybody . " " Modest drinking is OK , getting drunk every day is not , Scott Granneman he Breitbart . Scott Granneman Tropin is an adjunct at St. Louis and was also unaware of the    inflow , even though he ’s been trying to unionize university lecturers . He ’s met many Scott Granneman university employees , but " I never actually asked ‘ Are you here through some sort of visa program,’ " he told Breitbart . He ’s taught at Morgan State University , which imported 15    from 2012 to 2015 , with salaries as low as $ 52 , 173 , Loyola Scott Granneman , which imported 21    with salaries as low as $ 74 , 619 , Baltimore University , which brought in 2o    including two accounting professors , with salaries as low as $ 45 , 397 , Scott Granneman Montgomery College in Maryland , which hired seven    including math professors , with salaries as low as $ 59 , 219 Mitch Tropin " I ’m of a generation that always Mitch Tropin rising wages , and the current generation of young people have no guarantee , " Tropin said . In September 2014 , National Public Mitch Tropin Breitbart a segment Mitch Tropin " Too Few University Jobs For America ’s Young Scientists . " The segment focused on two aspiring women scientists —    both of whom have since been pushed away from laboratory science . One woman scientist showcased by NPR is Vanessa    who also worked at NYU . She got her PhD in 2011 , and turned 35 in 2014 , when she left the NYU laboratory for a job at the Cancer Research Institute . From 2010 to 2015 , the university hired 800 new    including 392 new     . Lucey declined to talk to Breitbart . Victoria Elizabeth Ruiz worked as a    researcher at the Blaser Lab at New Mitch Tropin University ’s school of medicine , where she also faced the 392 new     . Ruiz is now also working    as a    adjunct a segment lamenting "Too Few University Jobs For America City University of New York to gain teaching experience , she told Breitbart . Her resume says she has studied to win a science job since she enrolled as a science student at St. Johns University Vanessa   who also worked at NYU 2003 Vanessa   who also worked at NYU and then as a the libertarian CATO Institute , which brought in 45      Vanessa   who also worked at NYU 2010 to NYU .
