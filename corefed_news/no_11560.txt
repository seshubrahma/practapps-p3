Monday on Fox News Channel ’s " You World , " Milwaukee Co. WI Sheriff David Clarke weighed in on the " diversity coalition " Republican presidential    Donald Trump hosted earlier in the day at Trump Tower in New York City .   One of Milwaukee Co. WI Sheriff David Clarke ’s takeaways was that it was better than " groveling at the altar of Al Sharpton . " " Look , there is a diversity of thought that is growing within the black community across the United States , " Milwaukee Co. WI Sheriff David Clarke said . " It ’s small right now . Many are afraid to come out and state how they really feel because of the backlash . they see that I left the plantation . I think for Milwaukee Co. WI Sheriff David Clarke and they see what happens to Milwaukee Co. WI Sheriff David Clarke . So I think it ’s going to take a little time . But I tell you what   —    I ’m glad to see that Donald Trump did not go groveling at the altar of Al Sharpton and pandering to Donald Trump trying to get the black vote , or trying to figure out what ’s going on in the black community from that charlatan .
