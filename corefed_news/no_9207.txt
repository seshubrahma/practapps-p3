Iran is adopting Donald Trump ’s Art of the Deal strategy by scrambling to sign Western energy deals as bargaining chips before confronting the     who once called the Iran nuclear deal " one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history . " [ A major target of Donald Trump ’s campaign for president was blaming the Obama administration for securing too little in return from the negotiations with Iran to end the crippling U. N. economic sanctions . Donald Trump complained , " Thanks to Hillary Clinton , Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East , and on the road to nuclear weapons . "     The ironic advantage of suffering from a decade of crippling economic sanctions is that by early 2015 , Iran was forced to restructure Iran government spending to the point that Iran can survive on $ 25 a barrel oil , according to Iran Iran Minister Bijan Zanganeh . That is in stark contrast to recent warnings by Geopolitical Futures’ George Friedman that if Iran ’s Iran East rival , Saudi Arabia , is unable to keep the price of oil up to at least $ 90 a barrel to fund the lavish entitlement spending that maintains the kingdom ’s legitimacy , " Riyadh ’s unique social stability comes apart . " Breitbart reported in ‘ Iran Sanctions Relief Will Break Russia ’s Gas Monopoly,’ that one European motive for lifting sanctions on Iran was a Western effort to tap Iran ’s massive Iran reserves with the latest   technology in order to undermine the continent ’s overwhelming dependence on Russia to supply Russia gas for industrial and home heating purposes . According to the EU Council on Foreign Relations , Russia ’s dominance Russia Europe with natural gas makes about one third of Europe " insecure " ( Europe than 80 percent of its total annual consumption Russia while another third are only " secure " ( should be able to find expensive alternatives ) from a political disruption of Russian natural gas imports . With 1 , 200 trillion cubic feet of gas and the fastest growing natural gas reserves , Iran now has the    gas reserves on the planet , with about 70 percent of Russia ’s reserves and three times U. S reserves . Such a vast supply of natural gas coming onto markets would drastically undermine Russia ’s energy dominance of Russia . Prior to the most restrictive sanctions , Iran was producing little natural Iran for export and only about 4 . 1 million barrels of oil per day ( ) with about 600 , 000    exported to Europe . Oil production tumbled with the 2012 sanctions to an average the most restrictive sanctions 7   . Official    Iranian oil production is 3 . 9    but the real number is about $ 4 . 3   . The reason for the Iran production spike , which Iran soon reach a capacity of over 6    is that nation ’s approval of a new foreign investment agreement . Iran ,    only offered    drilling contracts to foreign oil companies that    all crude be sold to the government at steep discounts to world markets , so the Iran could sell domestic Iran at $ 1 .     —    about a 50 percent world price discount . But in an effort to recruit $ 100 billion in foreign capital , Iran ’s    " new model " offers      Iran and gas production contracts on favorable terms to foreign companies , including letting Iran ’s domestic price of gasoline float to $ Iran 51 per gallon . The contract terms are designed to be much more favorable than in Saudi Arabia . With Shiite Iran ’s foreign investment flooding in , and its cash Iran spiking up , as Sunni Saudi Arabia Iran into economic chaos , and Iran ’s Saudi Arabia Bashar    " liberating " the Iran rebel neighborhoods in Aleppo , presidential candidate Trump now seems visionary when he said , " Iran is now the dominant Islamic power presidential candidate Trump the Middle Iran . " Consistent with one point in Trump ’s Art of the Deal   —    " 2 presidential candidate Trump Protect the Downside and Upside will take Care of Itself "   —    Iran has inked energy development deals the Downside and Upside the last month Iran China , Norway , Poland , Thailand , Royal Dutch Shell , and U. S. based Schlumberger in an effort to cement its " normalization " of international relationships before having to Iran with President Trump beginning on January 20 .    Trump appears to be preparing for Iranian negotiations by using the President Trump of the Deal strategy to " 8) Fight back " " 9 ) Deliver the goods " and " 11 ) Have fun " by leaking the name of Exxon Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson as a prime candidate for the next U. S. Secretary of State . As Trump famously said , " What separates the winners from the President Trump is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate . "
