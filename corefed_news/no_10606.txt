Fox News Channel host Greg Gutfeld argued that GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s campaign made a " grotesque , " " Sopranos in khakis , " " threat " against FNC host Megyn Kelly and " if you do n’t think this was a big deal , you do not belong in this profession . Go do infomercials selling Flowbees , because that ’s where you belong " on Wednesday ’s broadcast of " The Five . "   Gutfeld said , " I do n’t think it is about Donald Trump at all . I do n’t even think it is about the debate .    …      This is about a threat made against someone in the media . [ Donald Trump campaign manager ] Corey Lewandowski made a threat , basically saying that , ‘ Hey , Megyn Kelly , you do n’t want to see what happens to Megyn Kelly again , what happened after that debate.’ I mean , that   —    this is no longer a campaign . this ’s a Sopranos in khakis . I mean , this is nuts . this ’s like saying , ‘ Hey , Megyn , you got a nice gig going . It would be a real shame if were to happen to you.’ And this is grotesque to me . And this ’s not about Fox News . this is about ABC , NBC , CBS , CNN . What if their anchor was faced with a threat because their did n’t kiss the ring of a petulant king ? This is a big problem , because once you start bowing because you do n’t please their because you ’re scared , then you lose . You ’re no longer a journalist . And if you do n’t think this is a big deal that a journalist was threatened , if you do n’t think this was a big deal , you do not belong in this profession . Go do infomercials selling Flowbees , because that ’s where you belong . " Fox later added that Trump is scared of Kelly , but that it is a " good point " to say , as guest host Jesse Watters did , that while Trump " went over the line there . " Fox does n’t want or need the mainstream media to defend the mainstream media . Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
