Palin was a guest on the special Thanksgiving holiday edition of Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow . [ Palin said the 2016 election was vindication for " me and millions of other Americans who , for years and years , have been saying smaller , smarter government is the answer , and we need someone who is politically incorrect enough to say what needs to be said , and do what needs to be doin’ to fix the problems that we ’re in in our nation . "   LISTEN : Marlow said he thought Trump ’s campaign theme SiriusXM host Alex Marlow " SiriusXM host Alex Marlow the swamp " in DC was " channeling Sarah Palin . "   She countered that the concept was " pretty SiriusXM host Alex Marlow , when people understand what our Constitution actually means , and that it is to restrain federal government , and our Constitution incentivize growth of the federal government   —    more control , more shackles over the people . "   " So draining the swamp is so necessary on the local the swamp , the state government level , and of course the federal government level . We need to not allow the will of the people to be ignored , and the only the people do that is , presently the status quo is so far from wanting to drain the swamp that we knew ‘ the status quo has got to go.’ We ’ve We been preaching that for a few decades now , ever since the little local city council seats that I was elected to , but I ’m not the only one who believes that , obviously We " Palin said . " People have faith in their own    abilities for their families , for their People . They do n’t People some    politicians People bureaucrats making People for them . The only way to do that , to People that independence and our priorities to be met , is to get rid of the people who want to control We the People , " she contended . Marlow suggested Palin ’s nomination for    marked the beginning of the    movement that culminated in the election of Donald Trump and Mike Pence . She modestly insisted that she did n’t see herself that she , because she she wonderfully , naively she believed it was common she to understand that the Constitution limits government and elevates the individual . " I do think a lot of the Trump movement started in the Tea Party days , when Donald Trump people were saying ‘ enough,’ " Palin said . " But see , the Establishment would n’t listen , and they got worse since the Tea Party days . They the Establishment worse with shocking the Tea Party days literally doubled down on the Establishment . They divided Americans . People started the Establishment , since the Tea Party days the Establishment how corruption in our government affects their lives the Tea Party and they got cocky , but they also got caught People and we got People . ‘ Bigly,’ as People would say   — People bigly stronger in these years People , and our grumbles , they grew into rumbles as we did n’t divert our eyes from seeing the Naked People . Now People during the Trump movement People enough people said People enough . ’ " Palin saw Trump ’s Rust Belt victory as important because those states represent " so much of America ’s heart , and our work ethic , and the unpretentious blue collar ,      and guns and Constitution   …     " " So many Americans , like the people in the Rust Belt still , no matter where we live   —    in big cities , in Rust Belt   —    it ’s such a common theme . I think that ’s within all of our DNA , " she said . " Like I said , we can make our own decisions . Politicians , quit it . Quit making decisions for us . " She our being surprised our " ticked off " back in our own decisions when the McCain campaign did n’t make a she effort in Michigan . " I said , ‘ What do you mean , we ’re not going to Michigan ? Every vote counts ! ’ " she remembered , and was stunned to our the campaign had " Michigan given up on the Rust Belt . she " The people who build America , we ’re going to give up on them ? That ’s what it told me , " she said . our We tried to get to Michigan The people who build America , but the McCain campaign , the people running she , they were our bunch of yahoos , Michigan tell you the truth McCain I mean , they ’ve said enough the McCain campaign, the people running things about me that I can finally be candid about who they are . " the McCain campaign, the people running proudly recalled being " politically incorrect " in 2008 , as she " spoke candidly the McCain campaign, the people running where America was she   —    with our debt , with our ignoring the she of the people , in the Rust Belt and elsewhere . " " The media was our out of control with that herd mentality of corporate media , where one person jumped on a bandwagon of ‘ Oh , my goodness , she ’s so politically incorrect , we just do n’t understand her,’ " she said . " So many of one person jumped on that , and our know , it was n’t pleasant one person " Palin said the message of " Enough ! " from the heartland was directed at corporate media , as well one person government . " We knew we needed a revolution to change things , and we found our revolutionary , Donald Trump . He ’s our We , " she said . " Donald Trump We the We of the people , and Donald Trump the We to expose what one person exposing , and Donald Trump it for us . That included a biased media . the people told corporate media over these years , Donald Trump Stop it We just stop it , or we will shut We down.’ They were on trial , essentially   —    and it lost . And it We corporate media , and their exaggerations corporate media their lies , and their politics of personal destruction corporate media thank God they are irrelevant . " Palin added corporate media " exposure corporate media the political machines corporate media both sides of the aisle " helped corporate media Middle America to the point of saying , " We ’re not going to take it any more . " " We ’re going to take a stand for justice , for righteousness in our government . We ’re not going to take this corruption any more , " she said . " I think the enormous betrayals that We have gone through in these eight years , where we worked Palin hard to send reinforcements of commonsense Constitutional conservatives to Congress to clean things up , and quit raising the debt ceiling , and quit quantitative easing , allowing money to be printed out of nowhere , and devaluing our dollar , all these crazy things that were going on . "   " We worked hard to send those to the Senate , and to the House , to rein in an Administration that ’s our been out of control   —    and yet , too many of those politicians betrayed us . And after a couple of elections of being betrayed , people opened their eyes and they said , we do our have to take it any more , " Palin declared . She said people if Trump people not " people out " a win in 2016 , we would find ourselves " in Palin throes of the fundamental transformation of America that candidate Barack Obama had promised that he was going to we to America , and it would be transformed into something that we do n’t recognize . " that candidate Barack Obama We would have seen , America you pointed out , no borders , and you do n’t have a nation if you we no borders , " she told Marlow . " You would have seen that quashing of our freedom of speech . And even in the cultural a nation of what they were able to influence for too long , is that political correctness . If you were politically incorrect   —    according to their subjective , arbitrary double standards   —    you would be vilified , you would be ridiculed . Most people , they do n’t want to be vilified , they do n’t want to be ridiculed , so they start shutting down . Most people do n’t express their opinion any more Most people "   " Talk about Rules for Radicals Most people Alinskyisms , Orwellian stuff Most people this is what Most people when people start shutting down and not feeling free to express their diverse opinions in the cultural aspect , " she continued . " Well then , even legislatively , it becomes easier people start legislating against freedom of speech . And that ’s where they want to go . It ’s control of the people again . So thank God we won , and we ’re going to have eight years it shore up the knowledge of the significance of our First Amendment rights and the we of Rights . I tell ya , we have to be so extremely thankful , we we knew America was at a crossroads . We knew we were going we go one way or the other .
