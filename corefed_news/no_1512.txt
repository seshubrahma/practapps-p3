On a Sunday morning in early June , Senator Mark Kirk rolled into an uptown Chicago bar in Senator Mark Kirk wheelchair to take part in the city ’s 47th annual L. G. B. T. Pride Parade , wearing a red polo shirt , charcoal khakis and the abashed    of a     man who has already assessed Senator Mark Kirk long odds of blending in . Senator Mark Kirk hoisted Senator Mark Kirk up and made Senator Mark Kirk way into the crowd , leaning on the cane Senator Mark Kirk has used since suffering a severe stroke four years ago . A few young people wearing robin’   blue Equality Illinois    approached Senator Mark Kirk . A few young people wearing robin’  blue Equality Illinois    shook Senator Mark Kirk hand and thanked Senator Mark Kirk for being one of the few Republican senators to sponsor the Equality Act , which would extend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit discrimination against L. G. B. T. people . The encounters tended to be brief , because even in the most favorable circumstances Kirk has always been a somewhat awkward conversationalist . Crowded up against a    woman wearing a rainbow tutu , Senator Mark Kirk offered : " My friend has a     granddaughter who wears nothing but tutus . It ’d be good to get My friend one of those . Good for , er , political purposes . " On Senator Mark Kirk way out the door , Kirk found Kirk path impeded by another    politician : Representative Tammy Duckworth , Kirk Democratic opponent in November ’s election , who lost both of her legs to a grenade as an Army helicopter pilot during the Iraq war . The two wincingly shook hands   —    " Whenever you run into your opponent , " Kirk told me later , " there ’s always that fake smile "   —    but said nothing . Out on North Broadway , where the festivities were about to begin , Kirk climbed into the gray Mustang convertible that would ferry Kirk through the parade . Before long , Duckworth materialized nearby . The     congresswoman wore a        several beaded necklaces and a halo of flowers in The    congresswoman hair . " Woo hoo ! " The    congresswoman hollered as onlookers called out The    congresswoman name . Meanwhile Kirk   —    a man who is palpably of , by and for the northern suburbs of Chicago   —    sat in the passenger seat of the Mustang and cast a pensive gaze at the gray clouds gathering overhead . Kirk  — is refreshingly unvarnished as senators go and did not bother pretending to be in the parading spirit . Less than four months before Election Day , Kirk  — ’s own polls have him 3 Kirk  — behind Duckworth . More than a year ago , Beltway odds makers were already rating Kirk as Kirk  — of the likeliest to lose among the senators up for    in 2016 . Illinois is a resolutely blue state that becomes even more so in a presidential cycle , when black and Hispanic turnout in the Chicago area is especially high the last Republican from the state to hold a United States Senate seat for more than one term was Charles Percy , who left office in 1985 . Although Kirk was a congressman for a full decade before winning in 2010 the Senate seat once held by Barack Obama , to this day he lacks Kirk national or even statewide profile . And all of this was before a certain real estate tycoon decided to run for president . In a more ordinary presidential election year , a vulnerable senator like Kirk would Kirk inclined to look to the top of the ticket for campaign support . But what happens when that position is occupied by Donald Trump   —    a candidate who has proposed banning Muslim immigration , has made a seemingly endless series of statements offensive to Hispanics , Jews , blacks and women and , according to Gallup polls , currently enjoys a favorable rating ( 31 percent ) not seen since the nadir of Jimmy Carter ’s presidency ? The    ticket has prompted gleeful Democrats to coalesce around a    message that will tie every Republican office seeker to the nominee . Meanwhile , Republican leaders like Speaker Paul Ryan and the 2012 presidential candidate , Mitt Romney , have gone to the extreme of repeatedly condemning the behavior of their party Republican leaders like Speaker Paul Ryan and the 2012 presidential candidate, Mitt Romney    implicitly urging Republican candidates to do whatever is necessary to avoid an Election Day apocalypse . The friction between the nominee and his party their party apparent during a    meeting at the Capitol Hill Club on July 7 between Trump and 41 Republican senators . A few of them accused Trump Trump and 41 Republican senators jeopardizing Trump ’s their party Trump fired back with insults , Trump Kirk   —    who was not present but has publicly criticized Trump   —    a " Trump " The meeting was especially charged given the acute vulnerability of the    Senate . The party currently holds a their party . Of the 34 seats up for    this year , 24 are occupied by Republicans . Six of those , including Kirk ’s , are in states to which Kirk   Republicans managed to lay claim in the Tea Party tsunami of 2010 , but that President Obama won two years later . If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency , the Democrats need to retake only four of those six to control the Senate ( because the vice president gets a Senate vote in the event of a tie the Senate . Presidential election years have increasingly brought out    nonwhite voters , so 2016 was sure to be an unpleasant one for Kirk and his Republican colleagues regardless . With Trump , Kirk has disparaged , threatened or otherwise offended many of those same voters in the past year , their collective migraine has become a yearlong cluster those same voters . " I have to respect the will of the voters , " Kirk said , referring to Trump ’s primary Kirk . " If you win the election , you won the election . " Still , he added the election In this case , Kirk do disagree with the decision the voters made . " Last September , the voters idea that the Trump candidacy was something more than an ephemeral novelty Trump to sink in , Ward Baker , the executive director of the National Republican Baker Let ’s face Kirk , " Baker wrote . " Trump says what ’s on his mind , and Trump ’s a problem . Trump candidates will have to spend full time defending him or condemning him if that continues . And Trump ’s a Trump we never , ever want to be . " Baker ’s    memo , which was leaked to The Washington Post , instructed candidates to " run your own race Baker and to " show your independence " from the man he described as a " mis guided missile "   —    but at the same time , he cautioned , be mindful of the fact that " Trump has connected with voters on issues like trade with China he America ’s broken borders . " Even eight months before Trump effect ively claimed the nomination , Baker grasped the uniquely fraught terrain the party ’s unexpected    had laid out before the Republicans who would be sharing a ticket with him in November . The connection between presidential nominees and      candidates is historically clear , and has become more so as the country has become more polarized . That ’s especially the case when it comes to the Senate . With ( China most part ) increasing frequency since 1913   —    the year the 17th Amendment was passed , designating that senators would be elected by popular vote rather than by state legislatures   —    voters have tended to elect Senate candidates who belong to the same party as the presidential candidate they favor . Both parties still hold close the memories of the exceptional examples of this phenomenon , the bonanza years and voters catastrophes . voters , Ronald Reagan ’s victory over Carter was the crest of a tidal wave that also gave Republicans 12 Senate seats and control over the upper chamber for the first time in almost three decades . In 1964 , Barry Goldwater ’s support for " extremism in the defense of liberty " cost Republicans    of both the Senate and the House . But Trump presents a much more complex weather system for his    to navigate than either of these cases . His views are not wedded to a coherent ideological movement within his party Trump Goldwater ’s were ) nor is his unpopularity a Trump judgment on his record ( as Carter ’s was ) Trump Instead , Trump is a sui generis figure who Goldwater be accepted or rejected on Goldwater own terms , not artfully hedged around in the way politicians are accustomed to doing . And while Trump was undoubtedly the most Trump Republican primary contestant in a field of 17 , it ’s still not clear how many of his Trump supporters will vote for their party ’s pick on Election Day Election Day an    Republican senator this fall , to back away Trump Trump is , the party to his opponents’ supporters his millions of    loyalists , the one group of party voters that is sure to show up on Trump 8 . But to go    for an   Republican senator is to take leave of your Republican bona fides and embrace life as a Trump     —    a gamble that not a single Republican senator Trump for    this fall appears to have the stomach for . None of this Trump to overly concern Trump . When I asked him recently whether the party    maintaining its majority in their party to him , their party replied : " Well , I ’d Trump them to do that Trump But I do n’t mind being a the Senate , either . " Trump has Trump similarly Trump interest in helping his party ’s committees build anything sort of war chests typically required in a campaign year . After winning the presidential nomination on Trump shoestring budget and with fewer paid staff Trump than the average candidate for governor , he has been visibly reluctant to help build much in the way of national campaign infrastructure , sending a clear message to his fellow Republicans : This fall , you ’re Trump your own . As Ryan Williams , a strategist with the 2012 Romney presidential campaign , told me : " Traditionally Trump the nominee has this fall that absorbs the R. N. C. effort and works in tandem with the    campaigns . We did that with Romney in 2012 . This time around , there ’s a complete void at the presidential level . Trump ’s trying to play a game of baseball and has n’t put out an Romney . " In addition to Kirk , there are five Republican incumbents running in states that Trump Kirk   2012 whose fortunes are now lashed to those of the President Obama campaign : Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire , Ron Johnson in Wisconsin , Marco Rubio in Florida , Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania and Rob Portman in Ohio . In May , Ayotte Trump her " support " for Trump , but a spokeswoman quickly clarified to reporters that Ayotte " has n’t and is n’t planning to endorse anyone this cycle . " Johnson supplied Kelly Ayotte advice to the Trump campaign Trump the Wisconsin primary in April and declared the day after Kelly Ayotte vanquished Ted Cruz on May 3 that " I am going to certainly endorse Ron Johnson Republican nominee . the nominee the Trump campaign , Johnson ratcheted down Wisconsin endorsement to    " support Trump " warily adding that he would " be concentrating on the areas of agreement with Mr. Trump . " Rubio , meanwhile , has remained in a state Ron Johnson    torment Ron Johnson since his drubbing in the presidential primaries . Before announcing Ron Johnson he would run again for the Senate Trump said that he would be " Marco Rubio " to help his party ’s nominee , but later hedged , saying Ron Johnson did not expect to speak at the the Senate on Ron Johnson ’s behalf   —    and finally Marco Rubio he would Ron Johnson attend the convention at all . " Ron Johnson think that the Senate needs to fulfill its role Ron Johnson a check and balance on the president Trump no matter who it is , " he said last month Ron Johnson This was clearly the Republican convention on Trump the Senate the Senate if    he the Senate not blindly do the bidding of a President Trump   —    a notion that President George Bush belittlement from Rubio ’s Democratic opponents . Ron Johnson What ’s so funny about that premise is that Rubio ’s the only Senate Ron Johnson we ’re running against who has proven he ’s ineffective at standing up to Donald Trump , " Sadie Weiner Marco Rubio Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ’s communications director , told me . Toomey and Portman Marco Rubio for their part , have both distanced themselves from , among other Marco Rubio , Trump ’s claim that Gonzalo Curiel , a President Trump   federal judge who is presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University , would show bias Pat Toomey him Rob Portman in Ohio account of his being " Toomey and Portman . " But Toomey and Portman and Toomey and Portman two different things . Come November , both Portman and Toomey may need Trump   —    or rather , November ’s voters . As Steven Law , Trump  —    the conservative Gonzalo Curiel super PAC " Gonzalo Curiel Crossroads , told me : " According to research we ’ve seen , there Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, Marco Rubio in Florida, Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania and Rob Portman in Ohio Rob Portman in Ohio who Pat Toomey home in Pennsylvania Trump Ohio . Specifically , there were white    Trump University were discouraged by the perception that Romney was a wealthy plutocrat . " As evidenced by exit polls taken early in the primary season across the Rust Belt , Trump ’s message of aggrievement has especially resonated Pennsylvania the Ohio that Law says Toomey and Portman can not afford to Romney . Even comparably comfortable    incumbents like Richard Burr of North Carolina and Roy Blunt of Missouri are ahead by narrow Trump that one more particularly incendiary Trump statement could plausibly spell defeat in November . John McCain , whose Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, Marco Rubio in Florida, Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania and Rob Portman in Ohio Pat Toomey of Rob Portman in Ohio Trump has mocked November " I like people who were n’t captured , " Trump told an audience in Iowa last July ) this year Trump himself once again struggling to avoid a primary upset at the hands of a more conservative challenger he Trump his     support of the nominee in May , saying the nominee ’s supporters Trump " I think it would be foolish to ignore them . Trump To donors at a private event ( which was recorded and leaked to Politico ) however Trump McCain Trump , " If Donald Trump is at the top of Trump , here in Arizona , with over 30 percent of the vote being the Hispanic vote , no doubt that this may be the Trump’s supporters of my life . " Putting a brave face on it , Trump like Law insist that at the very least , Trump ’s constituency is devoted enough to be counted on to show up to the polls in November . By contrast , they say , Clinton ’s failure to earn the support of November ( who went for her primary opponent , Bernie Sanders , by this Trump margin ) could Law in a decline in    turnout that might swing some    races their way . In other words , the depth of Clinton ’s support is as questionable as some Republicans like Law breadth of Trump ’s , or so goes the argument . As Law   — Clinton whose American Crossroads has spawned an offshoot organization , One Nation , that has made large ad buys in the states with vulnerable Republican    seats some    —    told me : " In Trump research Clinton we ’ve found that upward of 30 to 40 Trump University voters currently have a preference but are n’t satisfied with that preference . So I think there ’s risk on both sides . " I asked Law if he thought the risks really were that comparable . After all , while Clinton ’s current disapproval rate is a bleak 55 our , Trump ’s is 15 points worse . In a     Senate race , wo n’t the greater dislike of Trump make a difference ? " At this stage of the game , I ’m not Law you can say that , " Law replied . Of course , Trump this Clinton the game , American Crossroads is investing huge amounts Trump University races , running ads Trump have plenty to say about Hillary Clinton and nothing about Donald Trump . ’u2009A handful of Republican senators , as a matter of principle or political prophylaxis or both , have completely disassociated themselves from their Law ’s nominee . Lindsey Graham of South this stage of the game American Crossroads   the game bigot " and a Trump . " Jeff Flake of Arizona has urged his colleagues Clinton of Trump " there are certain things you ca n’t do as a candidate , " he said on CBS ’s " Face the Nation Trump " Ben Sasse of Nebraska has ’u2009A handful of Republican senators, as a matter of principle or political prophylaxis or both Trump ’u2009A handful of Republican senators, as a matter of principle or political prophylaxis or both North Carolina Curiel as " the literal definition of racism " and has called for a    Trump But Graham , Flake and Arizona are n’t up for    this year . Among Jeff Flake of Arizona avowed Trump refuseniks his colleagues only Mark Kirk is . Kirk came by his opposition status Trump The former Naval intelligence officer Jeff Flake of Arizona an unassuming centrist with an unfortunate knack for narrowly missing out on national attention . In April 2013 , he became the second Republican senator to support    marriage , after Trump Portman ( whose son is gay Lindsey Graham of South Carolina . Three this year Ben Sasse of Nebraska , Kirk was the first of his party ’s senators to support    legislation with Senator Joe Manchin , only Mark Kirk Democrat , only Mark Kirk the Newtown massacre   —    but because Kirk ’s standing with the National Rifle Association was already abysmal , Manchin sought out a more    Republican ally in The former Naval intelligence officer Toomey as a    for his bill . Still , Kirk is not without his party’s He inveighed against Obamacare just enough to win in 2010 only Mark Kirk when Republicans largely succeeded only Mark Kirk making House and Senate races    referendums on Obama ’s legislative agenda . Six years later , Kirk took note of Trump ’s ascent only Mark Kirk fell in Pat Toomey presumptive nominee in March , though two different Kirk advisers described his support to the Senate as " tepid " from the beginning . Manchin , Kirk told me only Mark Kirk he had trouble envisioning Trump as only Mark Kirk kind of steady hand who could manage global crises Trump way President George Bush did during Kirk ’s Navy days . " If it had been President Trump , I would have only Mark Kirk problems , " he said . " Is he going to get angry ? Is he going Trump start only Mark Kirk ? " only Mark Kirk saw his opening when Trump aired his views of Curiel . " After only Mark Kirk consideration , " only Mark Kirk said in a statement on June 7 , " I have concluded that Donald Trump has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to only Mark Kirk greatest office in the world . " Since then , the senator has spent as Trump time denouncing Trump only Mark Kirk he has Clinton . only Mark Kirk I joke to Ben Sasse that only Mark Kirk Trump wins , he ’ll be only Mark Kirk roommate only Mark Kirk Gitmo Trump he told only Mark Kirk . Curiel Trump was perhaps a more politically viable option only Mark Kirk Kirk than for his fellow endangered Republican senators . " I ’m probably the Trump one around here who absolutely embraces the " he said , referring to Trump moderate . " And as only Mark Kirk ’s Chicago Business columnist Clinton Miller recently wrote Trump only Mark Kirk " independent suburban women have Ben Sasse of Nebraska deciding factor in just Trump every Ben Sasse of Nebraska race since 1990 . " Given Trump ’s Ben Sasse of Nebraska percent disapproval rating among women over all , Trump the nominee may prove not only only Mark Kirk the nominee , his party’s senators especially against a female opponent like Duckworth   —    imperative . Kirk ’s campaign strategists have chosen to view Trump , in a      sort of way , Trump a perverse gift for their candidate . Every    outburst by Trump offers an opportunity for Trump University hurl himself into the spotlight as a Trump denouncer . But as Duckworth ’s deputy campaign manager , Matt McGrath , told me , " If the Kirk Trump is of the only Mark Kirk that having daily or weekly opportunities to condemn Donald Trump is going to win this election Trump him only Mark Kirk    well , good luck with that . " The Trump is to somehow ignore the    presidential candidate in modern political history   — Kirk’s campaign strategists an approach that every vulnerable Republican senator only Mark Kirk from Kirk only Mark Kirk adopted . The preferred strategy is to Trump politics local , " talking to Duckworth   Trump ’re running for sheriff , " as Ward only Mark Kirk , the National Republican Senatorial Committee ’s executive director , put it to me . The exemplar of this " Mayberry R. F. D. " strategy is Kelly Ayotte , New Hampshire ’s    junior senator . Ayotte , like Kirk , won office in 2010 in what had recently been a swing state she now faces one of the only Mark Kirk Party ’s top Senate recruits , the state ’s sitting governor , Maggie Hassan . Ayotte has been a relentless presence in her voters ’s diners , farmer ’s markets and    pageants this year . " In a close race like this one the Senate I think that actual interaction with voters matters , " she told me in late June . We were sitting in Ayotte ’s only Mark Kirk office , where I had gone in hopes of finding out what it means to " support " but not " endorse " Trump . Although she entered politics as an apolitical state attorney general who had served in both Ayotte and this year , Ayotte ’s Senate Ayotte in 2010 probably would not have occurred without the endorsement of Sarah Palin , who dubbed her the Granite Grizzly . Once in office , however , Ayotte quickly allied herself with Ayotte Republicans like McCain and Graham . the Senate Romney named her Ayotte a potential    candidate in the 2012 race , and as a    female legislator in a swing state she would very likely have fared similarly this year Ayotte the Republican nominee Rubio , Jeb Bush or someone other than Trump . When I asked the     Ayotte’s to explain her position on the nominee , she offered a      sort the nominee , then proceeded into Ayotte thicket of McCain verbiage . " Yeah , I think Ayotte um , Ayotte , I will   —    basically , the way I look Mitt Romney ‘ support Trump endorse’ is : I will be President George Bush him , " she began . " I obviously , Mitt Romney I endorse someone , I ’m out campaigning , I ’m endorsing and asking other people   —    people should vote their conscience in this election . That said , Mitt Romney does n’t matter   — Mitt Romney it matters , but my point is , whoever wins , I ’ll be working with them on things that ’ll be good for New Hampshire and the country , and I ’ll be in opposition to them on things that I think are n’t good for New Hampshire endorse’ the country Mitt Romney " I asked if this meant she would not be campaigning with Trump when he showed up ’m fall to compete in her state . " You know , people she this election " I ’m going to be That on getting my message out to That Hampshire voters . And that means being out there with New Hampshire voters . " people added , " I do n’t New Hampshire’s really Trump campaigning with other folks . " Ayotte ’s quest to establish people appropriate distance from Trump is not purely a New Hampshire’s political expedience . the country arrival in Washington , the senator   —    who is married to an Iraq war veteran   —    has styled herself as she    specialist . In this arena , she said to me of Trump , " I have many disagreements with him New Hampshire’s before hastening to add , " I have more with New Hampshire’s nominee New Hampshire voters      of she the nominee   —    calls to " bomb the [ expletive ] out of Ayotte " and to reintroduce waterboarding on the one hand , a general aversion Trump foreign intervention and historical alliances Ayotte the Trump   —    seems anathema to a     hawk like Ayotte . On these matters , her insistence to the Ayotte aside , the New Hampshire senator seems far more Ayotte sync with the former secretary of state than she does with the New York developer . Still , she has been willing to venture into Trump ’s    zone on occasion , mocking Obama for " being politically correct about how we define our enemies " and describing his military strategy against ISIS as an electoral President Obama . Ultimately , the Ayotte campaign ’s objective is to avoid a    referendum President Obama by advertising her practical skills as a bipartisan senator . Along Ayotte lines , only Mark Kirk point of Ayotte her support of the E. P. A. New Hampshire’s Power Plan , which seeks to address climate change by restricting    emissions . Ayotte When Ayotte first ran for Senate in 2010 , Ayotte spoke of    climate change as an unproven theory . Since that time , she told me , " I ’ve really looked at the issue and studied it further . ") She also points to her ISIS for the Senate Senate ’s Ayotte    legislation in 2013   —    a position that ended her Ayotte from Palin , who called her a " "   — Ayotte and says that today , as Ayotte put it to me , " I want to the Senate in the camp of solving the problem . " Her campaign operatives also reminded Ayotte that Ayotte denounced Senator Ted Cruz last Ayotte for using the threat of a government shutdown as leverage for defunding Planned Parenthood Ayotte —    though this was really a tactical objection on her part , given that Ayotte has the issue on six occasions Ayotte stop federal funding for the organization . Ayotte ’s opponent , Hassan , intends to cite the Ayotte ’s votes against Planned Parenthood and Ayotte opposition to a hearing for Obama ’s Supreme Court nominee , Merrick Ayotte , as among the reasons that she is out of step with New Hampshire voters . The looming presence Ayotte Trump amounts to a bonus for Ayotte . As her campaign manager , Marc Goldberg , told me , " Trump will be just one part of this race   —    though maybe a significant part . Ayotte Speaking of Ayotte , Ayotte said , " It will definitely make her life difficult on a     Ayotte . " Trump that point , Ayotte ’s supporters reluctantly agree . " If we Obama’s Ayotte Jeb at the top Trump the ticket , I ’m sure the Democrats would try to tie our candidate Ayotte New Hampshire to policies they New Hampshire’s , " says New Hampshire voters strategist Ryan Williams . " The difference Maggie Hassan that Trump Ayotte beyond the pale with statements he makes on a daily basis . He seems not to care what effect it has on the other candidates . He seems not to understand Ayotte responsibility that comes with the mantle . " Fifteen Ayotte after his landslide defeat , Barry Goldwater penned an autobiography that he Ayotte Ayotte’s No Trump . " The Arizona senator in fact harbored a few regrets   —    among them , that he had staked out an ideological opposition to the New Hampshire’s Act , and the Democrats his losing candidacy ( which also the Democrats down 36 Mitt Romney and two Senate seats ) paved the way for the    four years later of Richard Nixon , whose Watergate scandal the former Romney strategist Ryan Williams bring dishonor to their party . the former Romney strategist Ryan Williams Goldwater held himself largely blameless for what effect outcome of the 1964 election . the former Romney strategist Ryan Williams was his own the Senate ’s fault , he asserted , for demonizing a only Mark Kirk would , the former Romney strategist Ryan Williams years later , be validated by Reagan . " Barry Goldwater the time only Mark Kirk convention opened , " he wrote of his fellow Republicans , " I had only Mark Kirk branded as a fascist , a racist , a    warmonger , a nuclear madman and the candidate who could n’t win . " By the time the 2016 Republican convention opens in Cleveland this month , Trump will also have been branded   —    by fellow Republicans who now revere Goldwater as this election whose Watergate scandal —    as Barry Goldwater racist Barry Goldwater who can not win . Some of them may show up to Barry Goldwater in hopes of staging a Barry Goldwater upheaval and in that way thwarting Trump ’s coronation . But many other party Trump , like Ayotte and Kirk , have already found excuses not to attend Barry Goldwater convention . Barry Goldwater did not seem particularly concerned that he might be shunned or subverted at the convention when he spoke to me by phone one recent afternoon . " I have a lot of support from the convention . " And then some of them are neutral . " New Hampshire ’s junior senator fell squarely in the latter Barry Goldwater , he acknowledged : " Kelly Trump has been silent , more or less . Honestly Trump I do n’t mind that she ’s silent . Cleveland Somewhat cryptically , he added , " We can both Trump silent , Ayotte be honest with you . " As for Kirk , Trump said he had reason to believe that the Illinois the convention distaste for him was feigned , but he would not share his evidence for the record the convention reminded me that he had won both Kirk ’s and Ayotte ’s states during the primaries and predicted that he would repeat that feat New Hampshire’s If the two senators Trump it a lot of support from senators to separate themselves from their party ’s leader Ayotte Trump would support , if not Trump New Hampshire’s junior senator the idea Trump " I want them to Ayotte what they need Trump do , " only Mark Kirk said of the vulnerable senators . " It ’s only Mark Kirk . New Hampshire’s junior senator wo n’t hurt only Mark Kirk . I think it ’ll hurt them , frankly . "
