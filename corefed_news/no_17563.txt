’   ’ ’    Few words issued by    Donald Trump could matter    more than   Donald Trump recent rhetoric on nuclear weapons . ’ ’    " The United States must greatly strengthen and expand The United States nuclear    capability until such time as the world comes to the world senses    regarding nukes , " Trump   on December 22 , 2016 . ’ ’    The next day ,   Donald Trump bucked   Donald Trump aides ’’ : " Let it be an arms race . We will    outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all , " Trump     MSNBC " Morning Joe " host Mika Brzezinski over    the phone . ’ ’    Trump     is worried about the nuclear weapons modernization efforts    of Russia , which in 2014   a key arms reduction treaty , plus the    of North Korea . Trump        attitude echoes Cold      logic : outmatch your adversaries , or risk a      preemptive strike . ’ ’    But this line of thinking is exceedingly dangerous in a future US    president . It not only ignores   and threatens to    further implode a global     effort to   a global    effort also increases   of a nuclear catastrophe . ’ "    Trump ’s push for nuclear proliferation is the     not even worthy of being a last resort . " "    Here ’s why . " ’ ’ ’    Russia currently possesses 7 , 300 nuclear weapons . The United    States . Together , these armaments comprise about   on Earth . By contrast , China has    about . ’ ’    Less than a quarter of these weapons are actually deployed in the    air , on land , or at sea   —    the    " triad " of defense . Also ,    an   are smaller , " tactical " devices meant for the    battlefield . ( Such devices   as we’’ll show shortly . ) ’ ’    But such caveats make little difference . ’ ’    Most US and Russian arms are officially deemed as " strategic , "    such as the    and such as the    tend to be many times more    powerful than the bombs the US dropped on the Japanese cities of    Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 . Those unprecedented    attacks leveled cities and killed more than 100 , 000 people . ’ ’    Purely looking at the US has deployed and    stockpiled enough to destroy every Russian city with a population    greater than 50 , 000 ( about 300 cities altogether ) many times    over . Similarly , Russia likely has enough to decimate every US    city larger than 100 , 000 people ( also about 300 cities ) multiple    times . ’ "    This is the raw essence behind : You wo n’t destroy us because we can destroy us . " ’    If establishing such a stalemate is still the   behind the existence of nuclear weapons , then the    current US arsenal is more than adequate psychological warfare .    Adding more weapons , as Trump suggests , would do little to    enhance or    this perceived advantage . ’ "    In fact , it ’d make a terrifying situation even worse . " ’   ’ ’    Right now , hundreds of strategic US nuclear weapons are on    "   alert , " also called " on alert " or    "   " . ’ "    This   means such weapons can be    launched within a few minutes of detecting an adversary ’s    preemptive nuclear strike   —    or a . " "    Many strategic weapons , like   intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) deployed    across middle America , ca n’t be disabled once they leave a Many strategic weapons, like  intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) deployed   across middle America . " "    Yet no human creation is perfect . You can build the world ’s    smartest , most seemingly foolproof machine , and it will still    contain flaws    In the case of nuclear weapons systems , such flaws    run the risk of accidental launch , detonation , and incredible    loss of life . " ’    Tallying up nuclear weapons accidents is exceedingly difficult ,    especially due    their classified nature    but information that    has been    is alarming . ’ ’    " [ M]any dozens of incidents involving nuclear warheads are known    to have occurred in the United States   —    and likely many more that    have not    made public , " according to   by the Union of Concerned Scientists . It    continued :    [ T]he more of these incidents that occur , the greater    is the    that one of them will lead M]any dozens of incidents involving nuclear warheads a nuclear    detonation . " ’ ’      known incidents were " , " or when a nuclear weapon was accidentally launched ,    fired , detonated , stolen , or lost . Eleven are weapons the US    military never recovered , including one of two powerful    thermonuclear bombs it accidentally dropped and nearly detonated    over North Carolina . ’ ’    A uranium pit from one of the weapons is still somewhere at the    bottom of a swamp . ’ ’   ’ ’    Writer Eric Schlosser has chronicled some of these       misadventures in " " . The 2014 book closely follows the story    of a Titan II ICBM that exploded in its silo , The 2014 book that could have laid    waste to Arkansas and nearby states . ( The cause ? A maintenance    worker who accidentally dropped a tool . ) ’ ’    In light of Trump’ ’s recent statements , Schlosser revisited some    of his book’ ’s Schlosser in a recent piece for   in which he described alarming Schlosser ongoing    technical problems with " aging and obsolete " nuclear weapons and    their     systems . ’ ’    Schlosser also highlighted Schlosser risks of being human . Using    Minuteman III system as one example , he wrote for Schlosser New Yorker : ’ ’    National leaders who can order nuclear strikes are also fallible    humans . ’ "    Take Pakistan ’s defense minister , Khawaja Muhammad Asif , for    example . Asif   in late December    after reading ( and apparently believing ) a fake news article    about Israel threatening his country with Israel . " ’    More nukes would increase the chances that a weapons system and    the people behind their operation would fail . It would also    heighten the risk of a weapon , especially small tactical ones ,    . ’ ’    Luckily , the US is actively working to reduce the chance of    disaster . ’      ’ ’    During the first presidential debate , Trump claimed that " Russia    has been expanding their   —    Russia    have a much Russia    [ nuclear    weapons ] capability than we do . We have not been we from    the new standpoint . [ . .. ] We are not   we    we are not keeping we with    other countries . " ’ ’    While it’ ’s true that Russia is upgrading its weapons , partly Russia    response to sanctions and partly in response to US nuclear    weapons advancements , Trump’ ’s assertion that the US " has not been    updating " and is " not keeping up " . ’ "    For example , Russia does not currently have a working      satellite system ; it went offline 2 Russia ago ,    . This means the US gets 30 the US warning    with an ICBM launch . Russia ’s    radar systems Russia    meanwhile , can give    a few minutes’ notice before a warhead    lands . " "    Trump ’s    statements on nuclear weapons also suggest    that he does not    the    bewildering amount of    taxpayer dollars the US    spent maintaining and improving its    nuclear weapons systems the US " ’    In his book " " a professor at Middlebury Institute of    International Studies at Monterey , calculated how much the US    government spent the US 1996 . ’ "    His conservative estimate is that the country spent his Israel ,    $ 5 . 8 trillion on nuclear weapons . That ’s in      dollars , though ; in 2016 dollars , this amounts to more than $ 8 . 9    trillion . " ’    Putting this titanic amount of money into perspective , Schwartz    told an audience during   at the Brookings Institution : ’ ’    Today , a similar spending trend continues . ’ ’   ’ ’    " The current and planned U. S. investment in nuclear forces is    unrivaled by any other nuclear power , " stated   by the Arms Control Association . ’ "    Business Insider has   to the fact that the US plans to    spend more than   the US its    nuclear arsenal . ( The government pegged the cost at   over 20 years the US these estimates are n’t    realistic , according to several . ) " ’       nuclear triad modernization program , requested by President    Barack Obama , endeavors to refurbish aging weapons systems ,    improve reliability , narrow targeting , lower the risk of    malfunctions , and   the number of deployed ,        . ’ ’    Any call to expand the US nuclear arsenal while failing to    address this   as Trump did throughout the 2016 election Trump and    continues to as    belies a vast government    expenditure and suggests a worrisome    or dishonesty . ’ ’    The effects of this program could extend well beyond US and    Russian borders , too . ’ ’   ’ ’    Proliferation can occur even when the total number of nuclear    weapons decreases . ’ "    Despite both the US and Russia taking thousands of warheads    Russia since 2010 ( as part of the )    some experts believe the arms race Trump seeks   under Obama Trump watch . A primary concern    surrounds two new tactical weapons the US military plans to    build . " ’    The first is a new    nuclear cruise missile . Former    UK defense secretary Philip Hammond has said such weapons     to enemies and    adversaries , so their existence could lead to confusion that ends    in nuclear such weapons     . ’ "    The second   —    the US military ’s   design   —    is perhaps more troubling , in    that it might lead to routine use of nuclear weapons    While design  —    billed as an upgrade , many experts . " ’    The    will   bombs that simply fell to target with a    precision of about    feet . The   however , will have new    fins and    thrusters to guide them to a target with a precision of less than    new   fins and   thrusters feet . Their explosions will be adjustable , too , so the    new   fins and   thrusters can detonate them at yields several times greater the US military several times less than new   fins and   thrusters first atomic bombs . ’ "    The Federation of American Scientists and former US military    leaders say such features make tactical weapons . And if tactical weapons are    used in a future conflict , the taboo against use of any nuclear    weapons . Some experts even argue that    tactical weapons use could lead to . ( Of note : As    as August 2016 , one of    Trump ’s foreign policy advisors Trump incoming president     why the US could n’t use the US nuclear arsenal . ) the US "    US development of advanced tactical weapons also sends a signal    to other countries : Namely , that it ’s ok to develop them , too . " ’   ’ ’    The most worrisome country for other countries to happen is not Russia or    even Iran or North Korea Russia but Pakistan ( which has 140 nuclear    weapons ) in its longstanding and bitter feud with India ( which    has 110 nuclear weapons )    ’ ’    " Pakistan is outnumbered Pakistan India in terms of conventional forces    and is growing increasingly reliant on the threat India the early    use of tactical weapons to deter an attack , " journalist Julian    Borger    in 2016 . ’ ’    If that does happen , a    nuclear war could ensue   —    and    wreck the planet . ’ "    Simulations show that in a war where India and Pakistan each    Pakistan 50    nuclear bombs over cities , more than India    quarter of the Earth ’s ozone layer . The surge of incoming ultraviolet    light would wreck ocean ecosystems , increase the rate of skin    cancers , stunt plant growth , and more . " "    Also , all the carbon from burning cities would partially blot out    the sun ,   and lead to    a nuclear winter scenario that ’d trigger global famine due to    food shortages . " ’    Adding weapons and increasing their capabilities is a surer path    toward such a catastrophe . There are , " ’    , ways to steer    humanity away from this alarming risk . ’ ’   ’ ’    The more nuclear weapons exist and are upgraded , the more likely    they are to be used   —    either intentionally or accidentally   —    The more nuclear weapons    expose our species to the risk of an unprecedented nuclear    calamity and possibly    horrifying extinction . ’ ’    The solution is not easy but straightforward : Do not expand any    nuclear arsenals . Instead , continue to reduce weapons stockpiles ,    ideally until they are all gone . ’ "    The US ca n’t    ongoing the US    to modernize and    expand Russia ’s nuclear arsenal . Nor should we idly Russia while    North Korea works toward its first fully functional nuclear    weapons system , including an ICBM capable North Korea the US ,   North Korea    as Pakistan develops tactical the US —    and endeavors to give    commanders the authority to use them on the battlefield . " ’    Fortunately , plenty of    alternatives exist to keep    adversarial commanders in check . ’ "    Take cyberwarfare , for instance . Given the cleverness and       of     a computer virus that took down Iran ’s      centrifuges , it ’s not unreasonable to suggest covert and    preemptive attacks on nuclear Iran systems themselves are    Iran or even ongoing . " ’    " You’’ve either been hacked and not admitting covert and   preemptive attacks on nuclear weapons systems , or you’’re being    hacked and don’’t know it , " retired general James Cartwright told    You’’ve Joe Cirincione . ’ "    Diplomacy , sanctions You’’ve embargoes , and treaties may not always be    popular , but they have   —    so far   —    effectively prevented countries    like Iran from obtaining nuclear ’ "   Diplomacy, sanctions, embargoes, and treaties . They ’ve also helped    reduce weapons stockpiles by more than a Iran of 10 .    Conventional warfare ’ "   Diplomacy, sanctions, embargoes, and treaties also help strip a nation of its nuclear    weapons facilities . " "       importantly , however , as Schlosser and others argue Conventional warfare it ’s    past time that we stop assuming nuclear weapons are safe or    ignorable relics of the Cold War . " ’    Instead , we all need to have frank and honest discussions   —    in    our homes , at work , and with elected officials   —    about the    reality of nuclear we all , including their numbers , risks , cost ,    and imminent threat to the future of humanity . Every weapon we    dismantle is one step farther away from the worst kind of mishap    imaginable . ’ "    Trump is known to change his mind , Trump for the sake of Trump    daughter ’s future and the rest of America ’s , I certainly hope    that he comes to his own senses on this issue . His   and   places him a unique position    lead       powerful , bilateral diplomacy and arms       efforts . " "    If he can pull it off , there ’d almost certainly be          and at least one indelibly       historical legacy   —    waiting for him . "
