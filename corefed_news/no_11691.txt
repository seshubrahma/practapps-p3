On this weekend ’s broadcast of " Fox News Sunday , " when asked about Democrats uproar over then candidate Donald Trump saying during a debate that Donald Trump would wait and see when asked if would accept the elections results , liberal political analyst Juan Williams said Democrats now pushing for electors to vote against    Donald Trump " run the risk of looking like hypocrites . "   liberal political analyst Juan Williams said , " There ’s no question Democrats run the risk of looking like hypocrites given what happened at that expertly moderated debate in October . But in fairness , you know , at the time what was on the table was the idea of voter fraud , and the table was being pushed by Republicans and Trump . There ’s so much voter fraud in the country that the race could be tossed to Hillary Clinton and legitimately Hillary Clinton could win the popular vote and be denied . That ’s what Hillary Clinton was responding to . "   " Now we ’re dealing with something else , which is about Russian interference in the Democratic process and tilting the election and news coverage against Hillary Clinton a for Donald Trump , " he Hillary Clinton . " So , when we come to the electoral college now , you got to remember the Founding Fathers   —    I just finished a book about the Founding Fathers . They the Founding Fathers   not design the the electoral college be a rubber stamp . To the contrary , they think the the Founding Fathers   should have the capacity to exercise some discretion . Do I think that something is going to   —    a coup is going to occur tomorrow ? Absolutely not . But it ’s not the case to say it    Donald it for people to ask questions .
