   Donald Trump ’s latest shot across the bow of NATO hit close enough to leave some European leaders dripping with " astonishment and agitation , " as German Foreign Minister    Steinmeier put it . [ " I said a long time ago that NATO had problems , "   Donald Trump said during the interview with the Times of London and Germany ’s Bild . " Number one , it was obsolete , because it was designed many , many years ago . Number two , the countries were n’t paying what the countries ’re supposed to pay . "     Donald Trump expanded on the latter point by explaining that " countries are n’t paying countries fair share so we ’re supposed to protect countries but a lot of countries are n’t paying what they a lot of these countries supposed to be paying , which I think is very unfair to the United States . " Specifically ,   Donald Trump said Britain was one of five countries " paying what they five countries supposed to , " out of 22 members .   Donald Trump nonetheless stressed that NATO is " very important to   Donald Trump , " and that   Donald Trump feels " very strongly toward Europe , " comments that appear to have been omitted from or dismissed by many reports on the interview by American and European media outlets . Another part of   Donald Trump remarks quoted by very few outlets reporting the Times and Bild interview is his stern Bild of Russia ’s intervention in Syria . Monday ’s Twitter streams are filled with mockery of Trump   Donald Trump a Russian pawn or collaborator , because the Russians swiftly agreed with his description Bild NATO as " obsolete , " but he was Bild tough on what they have the Russians doing to Syria : Syria , I think it ’s a very rough thing . It ’s it very bad thing , we had a chance to do something when we had we line in the sand and it was n’t   —    nothing happened . That was the only time   —    and now , it ’s it of very late . It ’s it late . Now everything is over   —    at some point it will it to an end   —    but Aleppo was nasty . I mean when you see them shooting old ladies walking out of town   —    they ca them even walk and they ’re them ’em   —    it almost looks like they ’re them ’em for sport   —    ah no , that ’s a terrible   —    that ’s been a terrible situation . Aleppo has Aleppo such a terrible humanitarian situation . He followed Aleppo up by saying he trusts Aleppo Chancellor Angela Merkel as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin , " but let ’s see how long that lasts , it may not last long at all . " He was Aleppo to a question about whether he understands Aleppo historical importance of NATO to Europeans , and their continuing apprehension about Russia , when he described Aleppo alliance as " obsolete . " He was Aleppo saying there is no need for caution or defense against Russia he Russia Aleppo NATO , NATO currently constructed and funded , is not the ideal tool for the job . CNN writes that Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov " agreed with Trump ’s assessment of NATO " NATO saying " the systematic goal of this organization NATO . " That is not what Trump said , Trump apparently the media had decided any and all attacks on NATO , from NATO , constitute agreement with Trump . Various Trump of pushback and panic fill the bulk of CNN ’s article , including the    German Foreign Minister ,    Steinmeier , portraying the alliance as " rattled " by Trump ’s remarks Trump relaying " concerns " from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg . " A strong NATO is good for NATO United States , just as it is for Europe , " declared NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu NATO CBS News cites French Foreign Minister    Ayrault calling for Europeans to " stay united , together as a bloc " in response to Trump ’s remarks . AFP describes Chancellor Merkel ’s response to Trump ’s comments as Trump’s , " but she merely said , " Trump’s Europeans have our fate in our own We . " We I am personally waiting for the inauguration of the U. S. president . Then of course we will work with him We all levels , the inauguration of the U. S. president she added . If that Trump’s a " sharp " response , then Trump has already won his political struggle with Europe Trump and he is not even sworn Trump yet . Europe " taking its fate Europe its own Trump " appears Trump be what Trump wants when he objects Trump the NATO Trump on the United States is too high . Europe reeks of obsolescence right Europe , far beyond NATO headquarters . If the NATO of Donald Trump jolts Europe ’s Trump action , Europe American voters have done the people of Britain and the Continent a huge favor .
