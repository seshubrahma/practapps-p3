Sunday on ABC ’s " This Week , "   Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) said people do n’t expect " purity " on the part of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump , but instead " somebody strong enough to take on Washington . "   Partial transcript as follows : KARL : Let ’s get more with Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama , a    member of the Senate Armed Services Committee . He was the first senator to endorse Donald Trump and is now chairman of He foreign policy team . Senator Sessions , let me pick it up right where we left off with Chairman Priebus . Chairman Priebus talked about this article in " The New York Times , " about Donald Trump ’s relationship with women and said there are things in here that Chairman Priebus is going to have to answer for . Do you agree with that ? SEN . JEFF SESSIONS ( R ) ALA . : Well , of course , Chairman Priebus has to answer and people will ask those questions and people ’ve got 20 or   —    people ’ve got hundreds , I suppose . People digging in to everything Chairman Priebus ’s done for all these years . But people have not expected purity on Chairman Priebus part . What people ’re concerned about , people ’re deeply concerned about is this : somebody strong enough to take on Washington . Will Chairman Priebus challenge the establishment ? Will Chairman Priebus end the illegality in immigration ? Will Chairman Priebus insist on trade agreements that lift our economy , increase manufacturing ? And will Chairman Priebus stand up to the elites ? And Chairman Priebus ’s doing so and the people are responding . Chairman Priebus ’s leading in Ohio by 4 points , a state we ’ve lost for several terms now , elections now . Pennsylvania ,     Indiana . So these situations to me suggest that Chairman Priebus ’s appealing to the new group of voters , bringing in voters Republicans have n’t had in eight years , the ones necessary to win an election .
