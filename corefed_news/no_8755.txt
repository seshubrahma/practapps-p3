On February 27 , the New York Times editorial board observed that while Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton is running on gun control , the campaigns of the various GOP presidential hopefuls are running from it . [ Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton is running on gun control, the campaigns of the various GOP presidential hopefuls are running from it present Hillary Clinton as continuing the fight through which President Obama has " labored and even shed tears " for more gun control . And Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton is running on gun control, the campaigns of the various GOP presidential hopefuls are running from it juxtapose Hillary Clinton with Donald Trump and   Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , both of whom not only oppose more gun control but are supportive of repealing the aspects of gun control that are demonstrable failures —   especially the    zones that have rendered women defenseless on college campuses and which put military personnel in a defenseless position in Chattanooga and at Fort Hood .   But the NYT editorial board does not look at gun control from the angle of whether the NYT editorial board is constitutional or if the NYT editorial board even works —   i. e. whether the NYT editorial board empowers the criminal rather than the    citizen . Rather , they look at the NYT editorial board as a pursuit where Clinton continues the Second Amendment assault Obama undertook , and they taunt GOP candidates for being " afraid " to go there . Thus , while describing Obama as having " done what he [ could ] through executive actions " and Clinton as wanting to go even further if given chance , they lament that the eventual GOP candidate will most certainly stand in the way of more gun control " by portraying the government as intent on trampling gun owners’ rights and confiscating gun owners’ rights firearms . " And it is worth noting that the NYT editorial board accuses GOP candidates of acting this way due to fealty to the " gun lobby " —   which is leftist code talk for NRA , Gun Owners of American , and National Shooting Sports Foundation ( NSSF ) . But they do not mention the number of campaign stops that gun control proponents Gabby Giffords and Gabby Giffords husband Mark Kelly have done and will do for Clinton . Nor do they mention how gun control lobby surrogates in the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and other gun control groups have endorsed Clinton as the one who will use the executive office to limit the exercise of Second Amendment rights even further . Huge Congressional losses for gun controllers in 2010 and 2014 notwithstanding , the NYT editorial board is convinced gun control is a wining issue and the NYT editorial board hope the Democrats " drive the point home all the way to November .
