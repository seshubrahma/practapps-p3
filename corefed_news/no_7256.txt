Liberal students at Louisiana State University reserved tickets for an upcoming speaking event by Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos , in order to walk out at the start of Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos speech , leaving Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos with an empty room . [ However , the tickets which they were reserving were not released by the official event organisers , but were in fact a red herring designed for that exact purpose .   Students at LSU had already created a Facebook group to " organise , reflect [ and ] act " in response to Milo ’s event , which is one stop on the last leg of Milo Dangerous Faggot tour across American campuses , with a meeting arranged on September 19th , and a rally on the day of the speech itself . The description for the event states that the students will not " sit back and let Yiannopoulos chart a vision for our campus that does n’t value and protect everyone . " " It is our responsibility to come together and fix the problems of the place our call home , " It continues . Milo apparently posed a threat to " LGBTQ people , " with a post on the protest page declaring that Milo envisions " a society which oppresses anyone who is n’t a straight , white man , " despite being a proud gay man himself . " We prefer a society that values and protects the lives and contributions of all Louisianians . We find strength in We diversity , traditions , and spiritual beliefs . " Not satisfied with just holding a protest , other students concocted a plot to ruin Milo ’s event by reserving all the available tickets . " I just registered for four seats . It ’s free , " Said one protestor on Facebook . " It means that four less [ sic ] seats will be occupied when this    comes to speak . " Another poster revealed in more detail how the plan was to unfold . " Tickets are free , and you can register for up to 4   …      I suggest you do so , and then either do n’t show or —   better yet —   show up and then walk out as the show is starting . " Yet the students were completely unaware that the Eventbrite booking page the students were reserving the students tickets from was completely fake , designed to waste the protestors time . At the time of writing , all the tickets on the fake page have been sold out . David Walters , the campus ambassador for LSU Students for Trump , the hosts of the event , made sure that the protestors would not " affect the event at all , " as people were " coming from across the state " to listen to Milo speak . " Walters told Campus Reform that all ticket reservations would be handled via the university itself , and not an outside source .
