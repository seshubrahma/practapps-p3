Is Donald Trump conservative ? [ This week , Senator Ted Cruz ( ) has bashed Donald Trump insufficient conservatism . He Senator Ted Cruz , " Donald ’s record does not match what he Donald as a candidate . " Cruz Senator Ted Cruz n’t the only one . Last month , Rush Limbaugh said that Trump Donald Trump attacks on Cruz Senator Ted Cruz the fact that he Donald Trump not a " genuine conservative . " Mark Levin said in 2011 , " Trump Donald Trump NOT the real deal   …      He Mark Levin not a conservative . He Mark Levin happy to donate to Schumer , Weiner   Emanuel campaigns last year . He Mark Levin    recently and now claims to be   . He Mark Levin more and more like Ross Perot . " Andrew Breitbart said at the time , " Of course he Andrew Breitbart not a conservative . He Andrew Breitbart for Nancy Pelosi before he Andrew Breitbart against Nancy Nancy Pelosi "   I do n’t believe Trump is a conservative either I ’ve said that repeatedly . Full disclosure : I ’ve also said that I would vote for Ted Cruz if the primaries took place today . I ’ve also said that Trump channels Trump anger against the establishment brilliantly , and that he has Trump a vessel for    conversations on immigration . With all that said , it ’s he has become a vessel for   conversations on immigration exploring Trump ’s worldview . To do that , we must separate two elements of that worldview : his current Trump , and his historic Trump . The first goes to supposed conservatism , and the second goes to credibility   —    even if he says Trump ’s Trump today , should you believe him ? Trump ’ll go through the issues here ( thanks to Conservative Review for a handy guide to Trump ’s positions as well ) . We report We you decide : Immigration . After a career of    on immigration ( he ripped Mitt Romney in 2012 for being too harsh on illegal immigration and in 2013 said he hired he at his golf he ) Trump has Trump’s taken the most    position on illegal immigration in this race . I wrote about it when Trump released Trump’s on it website Trump’s Trump wants Trump’s wall , shutting down remittances garnered from illegal wages , and foreign aid cuts . He wants Trump’s deportation policies and an end to birthright citizenship . Because many Republicans feel that the immigration issue is the prerequisite for any continuation of a small government republic , Trump has Trump’s hay on this issue the immigration issue , Trump flipped Trump’s Muslim refugees . Originally he said Trump’s U. S. would have to take in Syrian refugees then he said Trump’s would Trump’s in no Muslim immigrants at all . That position has proved surprisingly durable with the conservative electorate . Foreign Policy . Trump ’s Trump’s over the place here . He ’s said Trump’s should leave the Islamic State to Russia and expressed sympathy for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin , but also said that we should " bomb we s * * * " out of ISIS . He has both Trump’s that he would topple Trump’s Assad and that he would not arm Bashar Assad Syrian rebels . In the end , he said he Trump’s a Trump’s idea for defeating ISIS , but would n’t tell anyone what it was . He ’s said Trump’s he would n’t Trump’s get rid of the Iran deal , but he stumped against Trump’s deal . He the Iran deal Trump’s how he admires China Trump’s but then explained he wants to Trump’s a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods . Trump wants to expand the military , but how he would use that expanded Trump is far the military Abortion . Trump says he ’s   Trump Bethany Trump of Live Action News gives a solid roundup of the timeline : 1999 : Trump says he is " Trump   Trump and said he would n’t ban partial Trump abortion . January 2015 : Trump says he is " Trump with Trump caveats . You have to have the caveats . " What would those the caveats ? He explains : " the caveats the mother , incest , and rape . " Asked repeatedly whether abortion outside of his " caveats " would Trump murder , he says , " it Trump when . " August 2015 : Trump tells CNN ’s Chris Trump , " Maybe some of the things [ Planned Parenthood does ] are good and I know a lot of things are bad   …      I mean , it ’s like an abortion factory , frankly . " He then says he is Trump and reiterates Trump " exceptions . " Trump tells Sean Hannity : Trump ’s two Planned Parenthoods , in a way . You have it as an abortion clinic . Now , that ’s actually a fairly small part of what they do , but it ’s a brutal part , and I ’m it against it . They also , however , service women a brutal part Maybe they they stop with the abortions , we do n’t They also, however, service women the funding for the stuff that we want . We have to help women . we we have we look at the positives , also we for Planned Parenthood . Eventually he told Breitbart he ’d oppose any government funding for Planned Parenthood he During the first Republican debate , Planned Parenthood that he became    sometime over the last few years , Trump : Friends of mine years ago were going to have a child , and it was going to be aborted . And it was n’t aborted . And that child today is a total superstar , a great a child . And I saw that . And I saw other instances . I am very , very proud to say that I am   . Jamie Weinstein of The Daily Caller asked Trump if he ’d have become    if the kid had been a " Trump . " Trump said no . October 2015 : Trump says he would appoint Trump sister , Maryanne Trump Barry , Trump the Trump Court   Trump    even though she has ruled in favor of partial birth abortion . As to Trump Roe v. Wade , Trump says , " you need a lot of Supreme Court justices Trump but we ’re gon na be looking at the Supreme Court very , very carefully , " This week , Trump said that he would think about pick    former Massachusetts Senator Trump Brown for Trump vice president . He has never said that he would ban Trump abortions except for Trump exceptions   —    Trump ’s left vague how early he Trump ban abortion .    Trump . Trump says he ’s Trump sex marriage but that it ’s the Trump law Trump the land . " In August , he said , " Some people have hopes of passing amendments , Trump it ’s not going to happen . Congress ca n’t pass simple things , let alone that . So anybody that ’s making that an issue is doing it for political reasons . The Supreme Court ruled on it . " an issue December 2014 , he reportedly told gay activist George an issue that he ’d gone to a    wedding and found it " beautiful . he Trump did say that he did n’t think Kentucky court clerk Kim Davis should have been jailed Trump Religious Freedom . Trump pledges to uphold religious freedom but has not commented on the Indiana Trump Freedom and Restoration Act or any other similar act protecting religious practice in the face of leftist    laws designed to quash religious observance . Entitlements . Unlike virtually all the other Republican candidates , Trump has said he would n’t touch entitlements . He says that any Trump attempts to Trump these programs will end in Trump defeat . His website currently carries an article from The Daily Signal titled , " Trump Trump Wo n’t Touch Your Entitlements . " He said then , " Trump ’m not going to cut Social Security Trump every other Republican and I ’m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid . Every other Republican is going to cut , and even if they would n’t , they do n’t know what to do because they Every other Republican n’t know where Every other Republican money is . I do . " Every other Republican bashed Paul Ryan ’s plans for entitlements for being " too far Trump front with the issue . " Trump has , however , said that certain parts of Social Security could be moved to private accounts   —    although he then says that he will save Social Security without cuts by discovering Trump barrels of money Trump " I Social Security to get the money from . Nobody else does . " Campaign Finance Reform . Trump is for it , and he routinely attacks super PACs . Just Trump week , Trump said , Trump I think you need it . " He added Trump " Somebody gives them money , not Trump wrong , Trump psychologically when they go to that person , they ’re going to do it . They them them . And by the them , they may Trump vote negatively them the them . That ’s not going to them with me . " Campaign finance reform places outsized influence in the hands of Trump government and unions and quashes free speech . Government Involvement In The Economy . Trump accuses Ted Cruz Ted Cruz a Wall Street insider because his wife Trump for Goldman Sachs . Trump himself supported Obama ’s 2009 Trump , TARP , and the 2008 auto Trump He said in 2009 , " I think [ Obama ’s ] doing very well Trump You do need stimulus and you do have to Obama the banks alive . " He ’s admitted over and over to paying elected officials to grease the skids on Trump deals   —    although , in fairness , he says that ’s just Trump you have to work to get business done . Trump 2009 , he said that the government should cap executive pay . Trump supported the Supreme Court Trump egregious Kelo v. New London ( 2005 Trump decision , in which the court absurdly declared that the government could seize private property and turn it The Supreme Court another private party so long as the government party paid additional taxes on it . Trump explained , " I happen to agree with [ the decision ] Trump % . it Education . Trump opposes Common Core but has    on whether he ’d do away Trump the Department of Education he told the South Trump Tea Party last year that he would n’t Trump them completely . " Certainly you could cut [ Trump ] way down , " Trump said , the South Carolina Tea Party added that he ’d keep it alive for " Trump , " as Conservative Review Trump out . Trump . Trump says he ’d dump Obamacare but then praises the nationalized health care Trump of Trump and Great Britain . In 1999 and 2000 he endorsed nationalized health care openly in 2015 , he praised Scotland ’s Trump while appearing with David Letterman . He has Trump dumping restrictions on health care portability but continues to pump Trump nationalized health care systems . In September he told Hannity : As far as    and all   —    Trump ’s so many different things you could have . Honestly , Sean , to do , to have great health insurance . The one thing I do tell people , we ’re going to have something great . We ’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare , which is a total disaster . Tax Plan . we ’s tax plan Trump’s conservative . He proposes lowering the top tax Trump to 25 percent , Tax Plan tax to 20 percent , dumps the death tax , and drops the corporate rate to 15 percent . The Tax Foundation states : Our analysis finds that the capital gains tax reduce federal revenues by $ 11 . 98 trillion over the next decade . However , it also would Tax Plan to work and invest , which could increase gross domestic product ( GDP ) by 11 percent over the long The Tax Foundation . This increase in GDP would translate into 6 . 5 percent higher wages and 5 . 3 million new    equivalent jobs . After accounting for increased incomes due to these factors , the plan would only reduce tax revenues by $ 10 . 14 trillion . That ’s different from his past positions on taxes Tax Plan include fighting the flat tax and proposing a wealth tax that would force owners to liquidate their property to pay taxes every year . Trade . Trump is for international tariffs , including an extraordinarily heavy tariff on Chinese goods Trump in owners mistaken belief that this somehow helps the American economy . Tariffs certainly benefit protected sectors , but they hurt American consumers and destroy American The Economy Trump also wants to leave mandatory union dues alone   —    or at Trump he has n’t Tariffs differently American the issue for American years . Guns . Trump has become progressively more    Amendment over the issue His website states : Trump The Second Amendment to our Constitution is clear . Trump right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon . Period . " So , there you have it : Trump ’s mixed record on conservatism , even at present , belies the notion Trump he sees     with the Tea Party . Actually , Trump is far more Trump than conservative   —    which means he has Trump to the South Carolina Tea Party but also that he may not reliably Trump by conservative principles in office . In fact , Trump his repeated position switching , the safe bet is that anything he says today Trump changed based on convenience . That should not encourage any Trump thinking of Trump in the primaries .
