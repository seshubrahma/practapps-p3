A group of " " are planning to forcefully " shut down " Breitbart News Senior Editor MILO ’s event at UC Berkeley on Wednesday , branding Breitbart News Senior Editor MILO’s event at UC Berkeley a " tool of Trump ’s fascist government , " while criticizing free speech , which they put in quotation marks , for allowing Milo to express Milo political beliefs uncensored . [ " Milo is a tool of Trump ’s fascist government : Milo has no right to speak at Cal or anywhere else ! Shut Milo Down , " declared the protest announcement email , which was forwarded to Breitbart Tech .   " Milo Yiannopoulos , mouthpiece of    is coming to Cal this Wednesday as part of Milo ‘ Dangerous Faggot’ campus tour . Milo rose to fame voicing disdain for human rights , vicious nationalism , xenophobia , misogyny , and unapologetic support for Donald Trump , which Milo claims Milo is allowed to spew in public because of ‘ free speech’ , " they continued . " Milo claims to be ‘ dangerous’ to a ‘ stifling liberal culture’ of ‘ political correctness.’ Milo tries to leverage Milo identity ( that Milo is gay and has a Black boyfriend ) as some kind of excuse . In fact Milo is a fascist , and students at campuses along Milo tour have righteously fought , and sometimes succeeded , in shutting down Milo speaking gigs . " " At UC Berkeley professors , and students and professors at campuses across the country , have raised that what Milo is doing is hate speech , which causes direct harm to students and campus life , and that is not ‘ free speech’ and should not be allowed , " claimed the student   . " The UC Berkeley administration has not fully responded to this , and is letting Milo ’s speech go forward . This is wrong . But there are even larger issues at stake : " 1 . People who protest Milo are not opposing free speech , People who protest Milo are opposing a fascist America , which is the actual , real , and gravely serious threat to basic rights of speech , assembly , and intellectual life . Milo Yiannopoulos is an editor for Breitbart . Milo Yiannopoulos is a tool of a government that accuses the press of being " fake news " when the press deviate from or criticize the Trump lies that has already begun criminalizing protest , demonizing dissent , and attacking science . the Trump has advocated severe penalties for flag burning , which is protected speech . What Milo is working for is not free speech , but to normalize , legitimize , and help consolidate the    regime   —    which is already marching down the path of crushing all dissent and all ideas that oppose it . 2 . Students who oppose Milo are strengthening the role of universities as places where dissent , critical thinking and the search for truth can flourish . Milo ’s bad boy attack on ‘ political correctness’ is a ruse . In fact , Milo   the government Milo   serves do n’t like the ‘ political correctness’ that has some currency in universities today because they want to replace it with they own , fascist ,    ‘ political correctness.’ This is a government that opposes science , and openly discards facts and then defends a government that opposes science lies as ‘ alternative facts.’ In under a week , they ’ve moved to wipe out all mention of climate science   climate data from the Environmental Protection Agency ’s website ! Legitimizing Milo ’s tour is part of changing universities and intellectual life and science to serve fascist order . Students who fight to shut down Legitimizing Milo strengthen the struggle against fascist order and strengthen dissent , critical thinking and genuine intellectual inquiry . Think of what is going on in the world   —    just this past week , this government has banned refugees , attacked Muslim immigrants , greenlighted the destructive Dakota Access Pipeline , slammed shut access to abortion for women all over the world , and threatened both the press and the UN to fall into line or face consequences . " Think of what would go on inside that room February 1 at UC Berkeley , if it is allowed to go down , " the leftists pleaded . " UCB , birthplace of the Free Speech Movement , tolerates a fascist rally , held in the name of ‘ free speech.’ Inside that that room racists and    will be screaming ‘ Build that wall ! , ’ laughing at rape statistics and sharing ICE phone numbers to aid the government with deportations . " " Milo is seeking to use the campuses to serve a larger fascist transformation of America and its entire America , " they concluded the campuses " Students are right to SHUT IT DOWN America yes , it ’s America . Fascism is dangerous to humanity . And you , if you oppose this with everything you ’ve got , will have the honor of being dangerous to fascism . " The group , who operate under the name " Refuse Fascism , Fascism plan to meet at the MLK Student Union on campus at 5 pm , February 1 . On their official The group, who operate under the name " account , messages declaring that fascists " will not be tolerated , " and violent retweeted pictures of President Trump bleeding can be seen .   UC Berkeley    previously doxed the private information of several student organizers for the event , even posting one student ’s workplace address while falsely accusing him of one student’s a " white nationalist . " Despite the " " attempt at directing harassment towards the College Republicans and MILO event organizers , it was revealed that several of the affected students were not even associated with the group or event —    despite having their personal the group or event posted online by the    group while being branded " white nationalists . " The    did not issue an apology . Following a demand by dozens of UC Berkeley professors to have MILO banned from the campus based on his political views , a group of Berkeley Free Speech Movement veterans defended the Breitbart senior editor , criticizing those professors and students who sought to use fascist tactics in an attempt to block his speech his " Under the terms of [ the free speech ] resolution , even the worst kind of bigot , including Yiannopoulos , must be allowed to speak on campus . So the UC administration was acting in accord with those principles when it refused the UC administration ban Yiannopoulos , Yiannopoulos the group of veterans declared . " We were the UC administration disappointed that so many Berkeley faculty signed an open letter supporting such a ban and criticizing the UC the UC administration to ban Yiannopoulos . Yiannopoulos MILO and the David Horowitz Freedom Center have partnered to launch a campaign against " sanctuary campuses " that shelter illegal immigrants from being deported . The campaign will be a campaign against "sanctuary campuses" that shelter illegal immigrants from being deported a speech from MILO at UC Berkeley . Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech .
