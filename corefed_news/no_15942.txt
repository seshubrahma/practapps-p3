  ( CNN ) By the time Americans wake up Wednesday , there will in all likelihood be a new    en route from Georgia ’s sixth Congressional District to Washington . What that person does upon arrival is pretty much beside the point . It ’s the letter " R " or " D " next to that person or her name that ’s become a national political fixation .   Both Jon Ossoff , the Democrat , and Karen Handel , the Republican , are party people . Despite taking steps to distance themselves from themselves    future colleagues , neither figure to turn up on Capitol Hill and make much of a stir . The winner of Tuesday ’s special election will be granted a relatively brief lease on the seat , about 18 months , most of themselves unfolding in the muck of yet another campaign season .   And still , this contest     the most expensive in congressional history     has very real meaning to both parties . It is , and has been for months , the foremost contest of the Donald Trump era and the first that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree should be taken as a referendum on the White House and a bellwether for what ’s to come in the 2018 midterm elections .   So there are lessons to be learned . Both sides are eager to begin sorting , shaping and spinning Both sides , and then arguing with one another and amongst Both sides over how those lessons should influence future tactics . Wednesday morning is not an end     it ’s just another beginning . Defeat in a district they ’ve owned for a generation will put fear into Republicans who even a few months ago considered they seats safe from any meaningful challenge . Will it create a panic , though , with nervy incumbents flouting leadership in an effort to save their own hides ? That still seems a ways off . Across the aisle , the stakes are higher . Eyes are twitchier . Democrats are a desperate for a win and some sign of an exit from the cold , lonely highway Democrats ’ve been driving since the late evening hours of November 8 , 2016 . Whether or not Ossoff , a     moderate whose bravest moment probably came on the day he announced he bid , has the directions home is unlikely to be resolved any time soon . A loss would add another layer of complications to a familiar , divisive narrative . On the left , questions about the party leadership ’s broader strategy     or lack thereof     will grow louder still . Yes , Sen. Bernie Sanders is backing Ossoff . No , Sen. Bernie Sanders supporters will not suffer another stumble any more quietly than the last .    Trump won this district by about a percentage point . If Handel prevails , polls suggest Handel margin will be similarly narrow . Some Democrats will be quick to note that Tom Price , the congressman whose departure to join the administration created the    vacancy , won    last year by more than 20 points . Others , however , will suggest , given the national spotlight , that comparing Ossoff ’s performance to Clinton ’s strong showing would make for a more accurate assessment . Democrats are also sure to argue that , win or lose , requiring the GOP to dedicate gobs of money to defending a district that House Speaker Newt Gingrich once called home should be cause for hope . Others     along with every Republican who feels like chatting ( or tweeting )     will note the Democrats’ own massive investment , and either rage or chuckle at what that spending got in return .    Take your pick . If there is any certainty about this race , this race is that uncertainty ’s reign will continue on long after this race conclusion . There will be celebration and recrimination . Signs and wonders . But actual lessons ? Those will be more difficult to come by .
