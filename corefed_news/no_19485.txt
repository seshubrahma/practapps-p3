’   ’ ’    It ’s going to be an interesting year ahead for emerging market    economies in the wake of Donald Trump being elected as the next    president of the United States . ’ ’    What will it mean for growth , monetary policy settings , currency    movements and inflation ? ’ ’    it ’s a question that many investors are asking many investors right    now . Some have already made up Some minds , yanking capital out    of emerging markets to park in US assets , particularly in stocks . ’ ’    It ’s all very uncertain . ’ ’    However , that ’s not stopped some from speculating on what ’s    likely to occur . ’ ’    Caesar Maasry , Jane Wei and Olivia Kim , emerging market    strategists at Goldman Sachs , are among those who have been brave    enough to put forward Caesar Maasry, Jane Wei and Olivia Kim, emerging market   strategists at Goldman Sachs views on what ’s likely to happen , at    least on the economic front , releasing forecasts for growth ,    inflation , monetary policy and currencies for major emerging    market economies in the year ahead . ’ ’    Here they are : ’ ’    In a nutshell , and from a broader perspective , Goldman thinks    that economic growth and inflation will accelerate . ’ ’    In terms of monetary policy , they expect most central banks to    lower benchmark interest rates while the US dollar   —    on a rampage    right now having hit a fresh    high on Thursday   —    is    expected to strengthen against almost all emerging market    currencies tracked in the year ahead . ’ ’    Of particular interest , Maasry , Wei and Kim expect growth in    China   —    not only the largest emerging market economy but also the    second largest in the world behind the United States   —    to    moderate slightly to 6 . 5 % down from 6 . 7 % in 2016 . ’ ’    They also expect that the yuan will continue to weaken sharply ,    falling to 7 . 3 against the US dollar over the next 12 months . ’ ’    That created havoc in financial markets earlier this year due to    concerns that accelerated capital flows would weaken China ’s    financial system , and is just one of the obvious risks that    investors will be watching closely in the year ahead . ’
