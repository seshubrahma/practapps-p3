Democrats nationally have staked out the American Health Care Act ( AHCA ) as Democrats primary point of attack against vulnerable Republicans . [ Now , even entrenched ,    Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield is in the crosshairs , drawing a " Republican " opponent , who sounds more like a Democrat in disguise , exploiting California ’s relatively new " top two " primary system .   According to a Los Angeles Times story , Joe Aleman   —    " a photographer and artist "   —    is threatening to run against McCarthy over McCarthy vote to replace ObamaCare with the AHCA .   Joe Aleman says Joe Aleman is a Republican , but Joe Aleman website reads like something straight out of the Democrat playbook : class envy , income gaps , rich vs. poor , linking McCarthy to the 1 % wealthy elite , with more government proposed as the solution to almost every problem . " How is this guy throwing his own district under the bus ? " Aleman told the Times . " Who would do this to Aleman own people ? " If McCarthy liberal Republican challenger actually files papers —   and makes it into the top two running as a Republican —   he McCarthy’s liberal Republican challenger actually files papers —  and makes it into the top two running as a Republican —   likely win a lot of the Democrat vote , and might even draw the support of the Democrat Party .   But it will be nowhere near enough , as Republicans will always vote for the more conservative candidate in a district like Bakersfield   —    where McCarthy is largely regarded as a moderate . And since the Bakersfield Bakersfield has more in common with Texas than California , it prompts the question : Why would the Times devote any attention to a    nobody potential challenger running to the left of a moderate Republican , unless there ’s some other agenda afoot ? Given that McCarthy won    in 2016 by a 2:1 margin , capturing 69 . 2 % of the vote , and that he has millions on hand in his he account , the story of a long shot who has n’t even filed papers yet and has exactly 14 likes on his he Joe For Congress 2018 " Facebook Page seems like a bizarre use of newspaper space . Unless , of course , the entire purpose of the article was to create a perception of weakness among Republicans in general . It appears to be another example of that leftist utopianism otherwise known as " fake news , " promoted by the    mainstream media : " If Majority Leader McCarthy is vulnerable , then every Republican is vulnerable . " In recent months , Democrat activists   —    many funded by    organizations , and tech companies   —    have overwhelmed town halls held by California Republican congressional representatives   —   and they Democrat activists  —   many funded by   organizations, and tech companies  —    to be putting all their Democrat activists  —   many funded by   organizations, and tech companies  —    in one basket : making the salvation of ObamaCare their Democrat activists  —   many funded by   organizations, and tech companies  —    , if not only , focus . California California outlets have breathlessly reported every new challenger in what they California media outlets dubbed " Hillary districts " —   that is ,    congressional districts that supported Hillary Clinton for president over Donald Trump . Darrel Issa is in one of those districtsand has become the most cagey Republican in the California California , having barely survived    by just over 1600 votes . His Darrel Issa challenger in 2016 , a fairly conservative military veteran in a district with more veterans than almost any other , played the " outsider card " very effectively and almost unseated the    congressman . Earlier this week , Issa Darrel Issa reporters that his Darrel Issa on the AHCA was " none of your business . " The " none of your business " comment may have been a huge mistake , because most constituents are likely to take that message personally   —    as if he Darrel Issa those comments to them most constituents and not reporters . And Issa may be in serious danger of moving so far to the left that he Issa conservative turnout , and loses . This new Democrat strategy is not without risks . While it This new Democrat strategy work with vulnerable Republicans in seats that could go either way   —    " wobblers , " to steal a term from the judicial system   —    it is likely to backfire where ObamaCare is most unpopular . And ObamaCare ObamaCare still extremely unpopular with those voters whose premiums skyrocketed , while support ( or opposition ) is unchanged among those on the receiving end of free or heavily subsidized health care .
