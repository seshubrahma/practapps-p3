’   ’ ’      Senate Republicans are walking into a trap , and Donald Trump      might be the only person who can save Senate Republicans from Senate Republicans .    ’ ’      Republicans want to repeal Obamacare . That much Republicans know , and      Republicans ’ve known Obamacare ever since Obamacare was first signed into law .      Had Mitt Romney been elected president in 2012 , undoing the      Affordable Care Act would have been relatively straightforward , the     Affordable Care Act as the Medicaid expansion and the health insurance exchanges      did n’t kick in until 2014 . Repealing Obamacare now would have      huge    effects . It would mean taking insurance      coverage away from millions of people —   unless , that is , the     Affordable Care Act Republicans can coalesce around a replacement that will cover      all those people or at least get in the same ballpark .    ’ ’      Republicans , though , are far less unified around what a      replacement ought to look like than ’ ’     Republicans are in ’ ’     Republicans      opposition to Obamacare . There are a couple of ways of going      forward .    ’ ’      Option No . 1 : GOP legislators suck it up and do the hard work      of passing piecemeal health reform legislation , with the help      of centrist Senate Democrats . The   would be to give up on      starting from scratch , at least for now , and instead give      people who ca n’t or wo n’t buy    insurance      plans the option of buying cheaper ,        insurance without premium subsidies . Subsidized        plans would still be available on the      exchanges , which would serve as a safety net for those too sick      or too poor to afford    plans with high         costs . Instead of pulling the rug out from under states that      expanded Medicaid under Obamacare , Congress could pick up a      higher share of the tab for the poorest and sickest Medicaid      beneficiaries while asking states to take on more      responsibility for helping the healthiest of the poorest and sickest Medicaid     beneficiaries , a swap that      would greatly relieve the pressure on state budgets . In short ,      rather than taking a wrecking ball to Obamacare , Republican      lawmakers could act as sculptors , chipping away at the      provisions Republican     lawmakers like least .    ’ ’        Option No . 2 : Repeal Obamacare without a plan for replacing        it and hang a " Mission Accomplished " banner while America ’s        health insurance market erupts in flame .      ’ ’   ’ ’        Naturally , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appears        hellbent on Option No . 2 . This is " repeal and delay , " a        strategy for unraveling Obamacare in the messiest , most        chaotic way possible .      ’ ’        Because Senate Republicans have a narrow    majority ,        ’ ’       Because Senate Republicans have a narrow   majority,        ca n’t overcome a Democratic filibuster , so ’ ’       Because Senate Republicans have a narrow   majority,        ca n’t        really repeal Obamacare root and branch . The only way to get        to a    majority is to embrace Option No . 1 .        What Senate Republicans can do without Democratic votes is use               budget reconciliation process —   which requires a simple        majority vote —   to roll back Obamacare ’s premium subsidies , its Obamacare        to states that expanded their Senate Republicans rolls , and               Medicaid penalties targeting those who choose to go without               coverage . Republicans in Congress passed a bill in        early 2016 that did just that , which President Obama promptly               . Once President Trump takes the reins , the thinking        goes , Republicans can get a big win under their Republicans ,               their Republicans bona fides , and then press ahead               slashing taxes and regulations .      ’ ’        Repeal and delay would n’t cut off the flow of Obamacare funds        immediately . It Repeal and delay give Republicans in Congress until 2019        or 2020 to come up with a viable replacement . So what could               go wrong ? Pretty much everything .      ’ ’        The Obamacare exchanges are already in shambles , because               The Obamacare exchanges attracted an older , sicker set of enrollees than the        Obama administration had anticipated , which has driven up               . Obamacare Obamacare designed to nudge younger , healthier        people into enrolling on the The Obamacare exchanges threatening them        younger, healthier       people steep penalties if they failed younger, healthier       people do so , but the        penalties have either been delayed or have n’t had much bite .        President        wanted to give insurers    subsidies        to compensate them for insurers        costs , but        Republican lawmakers intervened , insisting this would amount        to a .      ’ ’   ’ ’        The end result has been a highly unstable insurance market ,        from which major insurers are constantly threatening to jump        ship . Instead of easing these pressures , repeal and delay        would further destabilize the market . Eliminating the tax        penalties would give the young and healthy even less reason        to buy insurance . Once the subsidies are placed in jeopardy ,        even        insurers will lose interest in offering plans .          and    enrollees who currently receive premium        subsidies wo n’t be able to afford their insurance enrollees who currently receive premium       subsidies Repeal and        delay , then , is a recipe for tens of thousands of individual        health care horror stories ,    tales Republicans        would have to answer for .      ’ ’        There ’s also the nightmare that would befall state        governments , including    state governments , that        embraced the Obamacare Medicaid expansion . By zeroing out the        federal payments that made the Medicaid the Obamacare Medicaid expansion        repeal and delay        bring on crippling budget crises . Just        imagine the           governors would give        their    senators        the   Republican governors town halls where        Republicans members of Congress would find themselves burned        in effigy Republicans members of Congress It ’s not a pretty picture . Honestly , the only way        repeal and delay        sense is if you ’re a          true believer who ’d rather see the GOP destroy itself than        sell out the GOP      ’ ’          But wait : Would n’t Republicans have years to craft a          functioning Obamacare replacement ? Well , sure . But they ’d          still have Republicans unify the GOP and attract a the GOP          Democrats . How exactly would they do that if repeal and Republicans delay set off a massive national backlash ? And what if          Democrats smelled blood in the         Democrats sensed they had a          decent shot at         Democrats back the          ? Repeal and delay          assumes Republicans will have more leverage in two or three          years than they do today . That ’s not Republicans true .        ’ ’          The good news is that a handful of Senate Republicans get          that repeal and delay would be an epic disaster for the          GOP , so they ’re pushing back against McConnell . a handful of Senate Republicans get         that repeal and delay would be an epic disaster for the         GOP Sen.          Susan Collins has come out against it , which is not          shocking considering she represents a            state . More Maine Sen.         Susan Collins is the opposition of Kentucky Sen.          Rand Paul , who has said he ’s opposed to repeal and delay Maine Sen.         Susan Collins because it adds . Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy , who has a          reputation as an obsessive health care wonk , has also          expressed skepticism about repealing Obamacare without          having a replacement ready to go . And as of Thursday night ,          Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton , a leading light among younger          conservatives , has .        ’ ’          You ’d think that objections from at least four senators ,          who almost certainly speak for several others , would be          enough to get McConnell to shelve his             plans . But most senators McConnell like most humans , are wimps . If          McConnell forces GOP senators to choose McConnell McConnell             bill , he knows armies of conservative          activists will McConnell any " nay " voters for having kept          Obamacare alive . That prospect might not frighten Susan          Collins , who has every incentive to present herself as a            centrist . But it might be enough to bring the          other dissenters in line .        ’ ’            Unless , that is , Trump President Trump in the way . Trump President Trump tweeting            earlier this week managed to spook House Senate Republicans            of . Now , he ’s President Trump to            suggest he wants President Trump and Democrats to work            together to replace Obamacare with Obamacare better and                       approach to providing Americans with insurance coverage .            Could this be a signal that Trump does            want Congress consumed with a    Obamacare meltdown ? Obamacare he            be more favorably disposed to Option No . 1 ( play nice )            than Option No . 2 ( let slip the            of war ) ? More to the            point , could Trump give cover President Trump Senate Republicans who            do n’t want to go Senate with McConnell Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell            strategy ? There ’s no way McConnell knowing . Trump could tweet            President Trump exact opposite sentiment five minutes after I publish                       story .          ’ ’            But how weird            it be if Trump —   a man who seems            blithely indifferent to the    details of            policy , and who ’s had no compunction about belittling                       fellow Republicans President Trump it has suited his            purposes —   managed to prevent Republicans in Congress his           fellow Republicans            making Congress colossal policy blunder ?          ’
