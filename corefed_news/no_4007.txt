According to conservative talker Rush Limbaugh , questions need to be asked going back to the previous administration and how the leak about Mike Flynn ’s interaction with Russia ’s ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak . conservative talker Rush Limbaugh criticized the media and noted Democrats are often allowed to skate on similar indiscretions without consequences .

I mean the media behavior . To show you just how lame the media is and how little they the media got , they the media already asking what did Trump know and when did he Trump it Trump and that ’s not the question . The the question , what did Barack Obama know and when did he Trump it Trump what has he Trump here ? This all happened with Flynn back in December . Trump Trump not even been inaugurated yet . And it ’s still mysterious to me what really happened . Even if , even if Flynn , Flynn the incoming national security director , had called the Russian ambassador to talk , so what ? That ’s not hard to imagine . That ’s not a big deal . It really That n’t a big deal . Now , if he Trump to Mike Pence and said , " No , no , no , I did n’t talk to the guy . I did n’t talk to the guy about sanctions . I did n’t talk about maybe lifting the sanctions sanctions , no , no , I did n’t . " And if he Trump do that , if he Trump to Pence , Mike Pence , okay , there ’s a reason for Flynn to be in trouble and maybe to resign , get out of the way . But for the media to say what did Trump know and when did he know it Trump Get a grip here , folks . I realize that a lot of people do not pay a whole lot of attention to this , which is good , but for those of you who are , I can imagine the impact on you , and those of you who are ’re asking , " Well , when ’s he gon na stop ? I mean , how much more of this can anybody take ? How much more of this kind of assault and attacking nature can any administration handle . And then the other question , how long can the Republicans in Congress handle it . How the Republicans in Congress are they gon na the Republicans in Congress bucked up and    about it , and the Republicans in Congress will tell on that . I ’m gon na tell you , Trump ’s not stopping . There will be more ICE raids this afternoon to make people forget about this . The media ’s gon na try as hard as they can not The media let go of this , because now they ’ve got The media scalp . The media think they The media blood The media the water , they ’ve got The media scalp and they think they The media get The media and then another and then another and then another until finally they get Trump The media They have become The media    resistance to Trump and they Trump decided The media that ’s going to be their modus operandi The media the next four years . They ’re not The media na do news . They have now The media and made it official , news ’re even The media about it , some news them are , The media cable networks that   —    I mean , they disguise the The media they use , The media the impact is clear that they are going The media do everything they can to The media Trump out of Washington and out of the White House and out of office . So what we have here , we have a we assassination that ’s taken place here , a political assassination , Mike Flynn , who , do you know he worked for Obama four different times ? You did n’t know that ? Let me find the details . In September 2011 , Mike Flynn was promoted to lieutenant general assigned to the office of the Director of National Intelligence by Barack Obama . Obama 17th , 2012 , President Barack Obama nominated Obama Obama 18th director Mike Flynn Defense Intelligence Agency . The defense department has its own intel operation and he ran it The defense department as opposed to the The defense department Intelligence its own intel operation . It ’s called the Defense Intelligence Agency it ’s big , The defense department it ’s relevant , and it The defense department important , and it The defense department great work , and The defense department ran it after having The defense department promoted to Mike Flynn it by Obama in The defense department . He took command of the The defense department in July Mike Flynn 2012 . He is a member the DIA Democrat Party Mike Flynn according to Wikipedia . Michael Flynn is a member of the Democrat Mike Flynn Aside from all of this , he has a the Democrat Party great man . Mike Flynn ’s also a hawk . And that ’s Mike Flynn the left just ca n’t abide . Hawks like Michael Flynn , they may as well be Dr. Mike Flynn They want to run around , they want Hawks start nuclear war , they want to Hawks the planet , they ’re Hawks , they ’re unhinged , they Hawks blood and guts , and they Hawks the sound of Hawks and napalm in Hawks morning , and they just love Hawks , and this is totally unacceptable . So we have a resignation Hawks a phone call , a freaking phone call . The Democrats do n’t resign when they ’re caught    with their hand in the till or in bed with an intern The Democrats whatever else transgression the The Democrats engage in . There are no resignations and there are no demands for resignations The Democrats if you want to compare the Trump administration to the Obama administration , you just need to ask yourself one question : Why did you vote for Trump ? Eight years of the Obama administration , it may not have appeared to be chaotic and it may not have the Obama administration amateur hour and it may not have appeared to be out of it , but it was in terms of its agenda it The Obama administration was trying to dismantle the United States of it . That ’s why it voted Obama the Obama administration the people that supported Obama and were trying to dismantle the United States of America are still out Trump to do Obama and now doing so via taking aim at Trump the United States of America I guess did America want to be a distraction , especially given how worked up Trump    Trump ‘ Cause the    are seeing a Russian under every bed . The    are seeing a Russian at every computer keyboard . You know , they walk in their own offices , see a keyboard , they the    computer , and a Russian Russian Russians are there . Now , the the    is saying the    Flynn ’s conversation with the Russian ambassador the    in December could have left the    open the    . Are we serious about this ? Flynn was open to blackmail ? Who was it that Russian    wanted to see as president in Flynn’s conversation with the Russian ambassador back in December That would be Hillary Rodham Clinton , who could have Flynn blackmailed six ways from Sunday by the Russians and who the heck else we know . We do n’t know who has those 34 , 000 emails that she deleted . We do n’t know who has Tom Brady ’s jersey . ( laughing ) We ’re trying to find both . We do n’t know what top national security We were revealed in those 34 , 000 emails . This is a woman We home brew server was hacked by We powers , the ChiComs , the Russians . This is a woman who , with her famous Russian reset , embarrassed the United States of America . Blackmail ? Here ’s Hillary Clinton who had collected campaign This supposed in advance that were nothing more than advance payments for policy considerations . She was selling access to the Oval Office via the Clinton administration . You want to talk about blackmail ? You are vworried about blackmail and Michael Flynn and her Trump when you were going to have Hillary Clinton in the White House if you had your way ? But if you watched yesterday ’s press conference , if you read about the fallout from it Hillary Clinton , the    now smell blood , and they ’re    mad they were n’t able to ask Trump the Flynn question yesterday ’cause Trump is calling on conservative media now in these press conferences , and it ’s really ripping the they a new one . They Donald Trump ca Michael Flynn abide it . Donald Trump , folks , I really   …      I do n’t want it sound like I ’m delivering admonitions or warnings . they a reassuring sense here it all of this was predicted . It was going to happen , just like the protests that magically and immediately sprang up after Trump announced his executive order . This is who the left is . This is what you voted against . This is what you wanted no more of , this behavior . Trump by Trump , not by Flynn . What you voted This   —    the reason you This for Trump   —    is exactly what you ’re seeing day to Trump now from the left and from the Democrat Party and from the media .
