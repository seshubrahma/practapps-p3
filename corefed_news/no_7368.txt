Friday on Glenn Beck ’s radio show , The Blaze TV and radio host Dana Loesch attacked GOP presidential    Donald Trump for the alleged indiscretions of Donald Trump past , ranging from Donald Trump business ties to Donald Trump previous policy stances .   Loesch argued that Loesch personal Tea Party activism was n’t something that was borne out of a desire to support a candidate like Donald Trump . " I ’m disappointed , " Loesch said . " I ’m disappointed because I thought that all of this talk leading up to this time   —    because remember , Donald Trump got Donald Trump start as a grassroots candidate . I heard all of this discussion about how we need to sacrifice this for the better of the country . we need to put forth the strongest conservative and we need to stand on principles and we need not to compromise . " " And Glenn , if I knew that getting death threats , spending weekends away from my family and going door to door and trying to get strangers I did n’t even know to vote for conservative candidates , and phone banking and    people I had no idea who they were trying to get they to vote for principle and conservative candidates , all of these fears   —    getting put on domestic terror watch lists and everything else to elect   guy who supports Planned Parenthood ,    abortion ,    ’s against the Second Amendment , believes in eminent domain abuse , has mob ties , is basically the white Republican Barack Obama , I would have never gone out there and stood on the streets and I would have never done any of that because I did not bust my ass and I do n’t think anyone else in the Tea Party did either to get to this point with this candidate , " this candidate said .
