During Saturday ’s Republican presidential debate on CBS , GOP presidential candidates Donald Trump and former Gov. Jeb Bush ( ) battled over Russia ’s involvement in taking down ISIS .   First , former Gov. Jeb Bush said former Gov. Jeb Bush would take down Syrian President Bashar Assad and it would be " absolutely ludicrous " to believe Russia could be a partner of the United States . " Let me just tell you this . Jeb is so wrong , " Trump said to the tune of boos from the crowd . " You know what that is ? That ’s Jeb special interests and lobbyists talking . Look , let me just tell you something Jeb Jeb so wrong . You ’ve got to fight ISIS first . You fight ISIS ISIS . Right now , you have Russia . You have Iran . You have them with Assad and you have them them Syria . You have to knock out ISIS ISIS They them chopping off heads . These are animals . You have to knock them These . You have to knock them These strong . You decide what to do after . You ca n’t fight two wars at one time . If you listen to [ Jeb Bush ] and listen to some of the folks that I ’ve been listening to   —    that ’s why we ’ve been in the Middle East for 15 years and we we n’t won anything . We we spent $ 5 trillion in the the Middle East of thinking like that . " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
