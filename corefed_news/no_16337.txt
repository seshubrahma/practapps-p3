The New York Times reported Monday that the Republican presidential nominee dodged the draft due to four student deferments and a medical deferment after the Republican presidential nominee was diagnosed with heel spurs , calcium deposits that cause bony protrusions on the bottom of the heel . Classification records shared with CNN by the federal government ’s Selective Service System confirm that Trump received a student deferment and was later found " disqualified for military service " in 1968 after the Republican presidential nominee underwent a physical exam . No ’habitual drunkenness’ or ’masturbation’ allowed , Regulations determining which diseases and ailments disqualify a registered man from being drafted for military service can be traced to the Civil War , according to a digital copy of an 1863 regulation manual in the National Library of Medicine that spans 100 pages .

" In 1940 , as European and Asian war clouds darkened America ’s skies , the United States implemented ’peacetime’ conscription for the first time     but the world was already at war , " he said . " The real break from American tradition came in 1948 when the United States for the first time employed the draft as a routine element of defense manpower policy , whether or not the United the United States war . " Around that same time , physical and mental standards for Selective Service registrants were developed . In 1942 , the list of medical conditions that could have disqualified someone from military service , if found to be severe or detrimental , looked a little different .

He retired in 1994 and now resides in Sarasota , Florida . " You ’re psychologically screened , you ’re physically screened in the normal things you would take a physical for , and your history is taken , " Dower said . " If there ’s any questions , they go out and get there’s any questions for whatever is required . " For instance , the standards of medical fitness for the United States Army were last updated in 2011 ( PDF ) when the " do n’t ask , do n’t tell " policy was repealed .
