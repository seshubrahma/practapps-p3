" It ’s not off the table , " White White House press secretary Lindsay Walters said . " We ’re not pushing anything to FY ’18 . " That came after a White House White House Monday night told CNN that Trump would n’t insist on funding for the border wall in order to keep the government running past Friday . Broader funding for " border security " could satisfy the President ’s demands , the official said a White House official on Monday night the expectation that wall funding would come in future spending bill negotiations . " Politics is the art of compromise , " the official said . a White House official on Monday night orders changed by Tuesday morning , with multiple White House officials scrambling to tell reporters the border wall was not off the table for the current budget negotiations     reviving the notion of a potential poison pill that could lead to a government shutdown . Democrats have been adamant about not funding Trump ’s border wall in the current budget negotiations . Those orders changed as Trump The marching orders by news reports Trump he was backing off his campaign Trump to build a Trump wall , a senior administration official said .

" Do n’t let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL . It will get built and help stop I have changed my position on the WALL , human trafficking etc . , " Trump tweeted . Still , Trump ’s Trump did not address the a tweet the border wall in the current budgeting process that , if unsuccessful , would trigger a government shutdown on Trump ’s 100th day in office . A Trump official said Trump was unlikely to allow a government shutdown over Trump for his border wall and said they believed Trump would ultimately accept A senior administration official for border security in Trump for the coming budget . The mixed signals from the White House just days before the critical government funding deadline did not just develop Tuesday morning after Trump ’s comments to a group of conservative reporters Trump evening . Trump himself muddied the waters in recent days by adding Trump to health care reform to the legislative docket , and promised a " big announcement " on tax reform during the week leading up to the crucial budget deadline and , coincidentally , the    marker of his the critical government funding deadline White House officials failed to send Trump clear and consistent message as they made the rounds of the Sunday news shows as to whether the budget bill needed top White House officials for the border wall to earn Trump ’s signature . The result has been an uncertain strategy that is reflective of the political reality a White House with few legislative accomplishments faces as it nears the end of the first    White House to both make good on campaign promises The result avoid a politically damaging government shutdown .    " They ’re feeling their way forward , " former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who    close both Trump and both White House aides , told CNN on Monday . " One of the lessons they learned out White House health bill is to be cautious and not try and run straight into both wall . " Flexibility ? On Sunday , White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Trump expects his " priorities "     military and border White House increases     to be included in the Trump bill White House chief of staff Reince Priebus but focused on the White House ’s flexibility in arriving at a deal to keep the health bill . " As long White House ’s priorities are adequately reflected in the ( continuing resolution ) and it allows us to get moving with an increase in military spending and a rebuilding of our military as he promised in one of your bullet points , and there ’s enough as far as flexibility for the border us and border the President’s , I think we ’ll be OK with that , " Priebus said on NBC ’s " Meet the Press . " But other top aides us same day focused instead on funding for the border wall     not just on border security overall . " I ca n’t imagine the Democrats would shut down the government over an objection to building a down payment on a wall that can end the lawlessness , " Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on ABC ’s " This Week , " suggesting Democrats     not Trump and Republicans     should catch the blame for a government shutdown over border wall funding . " It will help us complete the promise that the President has made to the American people . That ’s what they want . The American people , they have a right to expect it , " Sessions added . Department of Homeland Security the American people John Kelly the American people Trump would be the American people insistent on the funding " for the border wall . The White House budget director , Mick Mulvaney , Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly Trump ’s comment from a Friday interview : " We do n’t know yet . " Health care , tax reform , The mixed messaging Trump health care , where Priebus and Mulvaney continued to push for a vote to repeal and replace Obamacare , days after Trump told reporters " it does n’t matter " if a vote comes to fruition this week . A day before that , Trump said he Trump " both " health care reform and a budget bill the same week . Privately , senior administration officials over the weekend Trump the Trump to rush for a vote on health care had subsided and this week House ’s priorities were realigning with those on Capitol Hill : to pass a budget bill and keep the government open . The White House also scrambled to temper expectations over the weekend after Trump on Friday promised a " big announcement " on tax reform this week , which the White House’s simply outline the administration ’s " the weekend and priorities "     broad strokes Trump already laid out during his campaign . Both the health care push and tax reform announcement pose a risk to the White House ’s efforts to work with Congress to Trump a budget bill by Trump end of the week by fracturing the attention of members on Capitol Hill and adding unknown variables to an already messy equation . As the West Wing embarks on the final sprint to the    marker of Trump ’s presidency , top aides were thrown into the familiar pattern of rushing to match action to the President ’s words while publicly avoiding words that could box in a President who prides himself on remaining " flexible . " But while negotiations over an Obamacare replacement have played out in public , Trump and his aides have been more cautious in drawing clear lines on its demands for a budget bill that could pass muster . Pressed repeatedly on Monday about whether Trump Trump’s sign Trump’s on a budget that leaves out funding for the border Trump’s , White House press secretary Sean Spicer demurred . " I do n’t want to get Trump’s of those negotiations . They are ongoing , " Spicer said .
