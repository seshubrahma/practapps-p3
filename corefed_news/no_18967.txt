" ’According to multiple reports , Sens . Elizabeth Warren and Tim Kaine , Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro , and former Adm. James Stavridis are among the candidates being seriously vetted for the job.’ ’Some   —    like Castro and Kaine   —    have long been expected to be among the finalists for the job .
