Friday on Fox New Channel ’s " Fox   Friends , " presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort said that the    " Never Trump " movement that planned to challenge Trump ’s nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland next week is " nevermore . "   presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort said , " presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort understand very clearly that denying Trump’s the nomination through some back room deal would destroy the Republican party and that ’s   —    not just the presidential election but probably the congress as well . It was never a real opportunity and yesterday in the rules committee , there were two important votes . One was to unbind the delegates   —   to free two important votes to quote ‘ vote two important votes conscience,’ that lost   . We crushed two important votes . The second vote was to let voters vote voters conscience . voters got less votes to the point voters did n’t want a recorded vote . As far as I ’m concerned , the Never Trump movement is never more . the Never Trump movement ’s gone . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
