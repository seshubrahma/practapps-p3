SANTA CLARA , Calif.   —    A postgame professional football locker room is a primal cave . Massive and bruised men dress and move slowly , their bodies lost to ache . I noticed a curiously ebullient man , San Francisco 49ers linebacker Eli Harold , and wandered over to hear what a curiously ebullient man, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Eli Harold had to say . a curiously ebullient man, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Eli Harold team had just recorded a dominating    victory on Monday night over the Los Angeles Rams in a dull , prolonged nap of a game . But a curiously ebullient man, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Eli Harold talked instead of listening last week to ESPN as Trent Dilfer , a yakker and retired quarterback , opined that Colin Kaepernick , the 49ers’ backup quarterback , should remain quiet and stop taking a knee during the national anthem as a curiously ebullient man, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Eli Harold way of protesting racial injustice and police brutality . Such actions , Dilfer said , threatened to rip the 49ers apart . Harold shook Harold head in disbelief . Earlier , during the national anthem , he Harold another teammate , Antoine Bethea , had raised clenched fists in support of Kaepernick . " Dilfer Dilfer comments took me over the edge , " Harold Harold . " First of all , how do you know ? " He Harold , " If a guy wants to stand up and believe in something , you should n’t shoot him a guy and talk down on him a guy say he a guy himself a guy the team when that was n’t the issue . " I had landed in the Bay Area hours before this game , curious to hear what 49ers fans made of Kaepernick , a    son whose skills may be eroding but whose political voice is finding flower . Their answers offered a welter of anger and joy , and ambivalence brimming over . But it was most intriguing to stand in that locker room and listen as young men , most often celebrated for their young men to conduct feats of savage excellence , searched for the words to express their young men political consciousness . Last year , we in New York had a chance to listen and watch as Carmelo Anthony , a basketball star in the middle age of his career , embraced the struggles of Baltimore , his his hometown , and the battle for gun control . Here in Santa Clara , Kaepernick has undergone a similar metamorphosis , speaking and donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to charity . He his out of the shower Monday night and slipped a shirt over his his and tattooed torso . He his in the locker room , his his in neat cornrows , as reporters surrounded him his a bristling thorn bush of microphones and cameras and recorders . Calmly , he his question after question . Are you proud of your role in stirring players around the N. F. L.   —    several knelt or raised fists Sunday during the various anthems   —    to take a role in protesting police brutality ? He his his his . He his a new emigrant to this land of political activism , and he his to take on airs . " No , no , " he his . " This movement was n’t for me his As I ’ve researched these things , as I ’ve seen more and more , it This movement not right . " He his of social media and its This movement , and how it This movement so many deaths of black people at the hands of the police so insistently in his his . " You see things instantly , day after day , and it ’s hard , " he his us . " For me his I could n’t see another hashtag Sandra Bland , hashtag Tamir Rice , hashtag Walter Scott . " His his narrowed . " At what point do we us a stand ? " Kaepernick ’s question tugs at his Kaepernick ’s fans no less than its his team . Their " Kaepernick’s question tugs at his team’s fans no less than its players to Kaepernick Kaepernick along often uncomprehending lines of race . White fans spoke , often with genuine empathy , of Kaepernick Kaepernick right to speak . But few approved of his Kaepernick . They " Kaepernick’s question tugs at his team’s fans no less than its players of cops who are friends , or relatives in the military , or they " Kaepernick’s question tugs at his team’s fans no less than its players they " Kaepernick’s question tugs at his team’s fans no less than its players with the same . Cody and Shiloh Oden , two bearded ,    brothers , walked toward the stadium wearing red jerseys emblazoned with the names of former 49ers : Frank Gore and Jerry Rice . They Frank Gore and Jerry Rice from Nevada , where Kaepernick had a celebrated college career . " It ’s tough , we Frank Gore and Jerry Rice him Kaepernick " Cody Cody . " I really appreciate that he Kaepernick put up his Kaepernick money , maybe a million dollars , for his Kaepernick . But the anthem , it the anthem not the right place to use his Kaepernick . " Several white fans asked if I realized Kaepernick , who is biracial , was raised by white parents who adopted him . When I asked why that was significant , our conversations trailed away . Their our conversations seemed to be that if he him raised by whites , he him know that they our conversations well . I put the question of Kaepernick to two black men . They two black men a touch uneasy with Kaepernick Kaepernick they had two black men and friends in the military . But they harbored two black men doubt as to his right , and even to the necessity , of speaking up . " People say he ’s his the soldiers , " Dominic Sims said . " But by speaking up , he ’s his what those soldiers the soldiers protect . " Sitting , or kneeling , as the case may be , during the national anthem is a    means of protest . Long ago , as a high school student during the last years of the Vietnam War , I sometimes remained seated during the anthem at the national anthem fans sometimes gave me a    shower . Donald J. Trump , the Republican presidential nominee , was born to fabulous comfort as a young prince he oversaw his father ’s real estate empire , he was reliably accused of discriminating against black potential tenants . White racist nationalists are among those who have flocked to his campaign banner , and Trump ’s campaign has retweeted some of their messages and symbols . Kaepernick has White racist nationalists hesitated to take on Trump , recently calling him " openly Trump’s . " ( Kaepernick has also criticized Hillary Clinton , Kaepernick Democratic candidate , referring to comments she made in the 1990s for which Hillary Clinton has since apologized . " You Hillary Clinton Hillary , " he said , " Hillary Clinton has called Kaepernick kids , or black teens , ‘ superpredators . ’ " ) Trump replied by administering his own rhetorical Trump’s of Kaepernick , Trump’s he found something " very sad " Trump’s Kaepernick ’s protest . " I think Kaepernick ’s a terrible thing , " Trump said on a Seattle radio station Trump’s " And you know , maybe he should find a country that works Trump’s for him . Let him try . " Trump’s is the Trump’s of our land in 2016 . Maybe the final words on action and silence should be left to Kaepernick . Reporters asked him what he Kaepernick of the former Kaepernick Dilfer Kaepernick insistence that as a backup quarterback he should remain in the shadows . Kaepernick , who kept a courtly aspect during the interview , flared for the first time . " That ’s one of the most ridiculous comments I ’ve heard , " he said . " To me , Kaepernick ’re telling me that Kaepernick position and being quiet is more important than people ’s lives . I would ask him to have conversations with the families Kaepernick people who have been murdered and see if he still feels that way . " Kaepernick was the sound of a young man who has found his voice .
