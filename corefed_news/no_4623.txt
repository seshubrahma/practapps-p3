" Host Ari Melber cut in , " I mean , you have tons of Republicans , legislators and Republican citizens , who would say there ’s nothing white supremacist about what they want . they have values , and a lot of women are    as we know . And to pick one example , and you respond ,    white women under 30 broke for Trump , not Hillary Clinton . What do you make of that ?
