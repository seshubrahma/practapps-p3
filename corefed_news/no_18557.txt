’   ’ "    There was a lot Jeff Sessions could n’t quite guarantee Tuesday . " ’    The attorney general   in his blockbuster hearing    that his couldn’’t " recall " a particular detail . That was in    addition to eight instances in which he did not " know " the    answer to a question posed by a member of the panel , five    instances in which he did not " believe , " four times he did    not " think , " and twice each that he did not " have " or " remember "    what the senator in question was looking for . ’ "    So naturally , the most important takeaway   was not   the most important takeaway   ’s    what    did not say . " "    On several occassions , Sessions refused to answer questions    related to    private conversations with President Donald Trump ,    including conversations about FBI Director James Comey ’s    firing , the possibility of presidential pardons for President Donald Trump associates , and whether Trump President Donald Trump expressed frustration with    Sessions’    recusal from any    investigations involving the Trump President Donald Trump . If these    conversations did occur , they these   conversations be central to a possible       case . " ’    Sessions ’’ rationale for his " ’    to detail such conversations    was his " ’    duty to protect confidential communications " he’ ’s had    with the president and a " longstanding Department of Justice    practice " not to disclose such information .   Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and    National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers gave similar    explanations before the Senate Intelligence Committee . ’ ’    Several senators zeroed in on that explanation   —    Democratic Sens .    Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Kamala Harris of California and    Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine   —    in their lines of    questioning , hammering the attorney general on the legitimacy of       the attorney general . The center of their argument was simple : the    president had not invoked executive privilege , Sessions could not    on his the   president invoke executive privilege , so how could Sessions not       the questions ? ’ ’    " You’’re impeding this investigation , " Heinrich said . " So my    understanding of the legal standard is that you either answer the    question . That’ ’s the best outcome . You say this is classified ,    can’’t answer it here . I’’ll answer it I’’ll closed session . That’ That’    bucket number two . Bucket number three is to say ’’ I’’m invoking    executive privilege . ’’ There is no appropriateness bucket . It is    not a legal standard . " ’ "    Sessions said it would be inappropriate to do so without giving    Trump the chance to review whether he Trump to invoke executive    privilege , a position that a number of legal experts told    Business Insider would not pass muster if Congress really wanted    to push the White House . And when pressed on the specifics of the    Justice Department policy he Trump citing to sidestep some of the    senators’ questions , Sessions could not answer much at all . " ’    " Can you tell me what are these    DOJ rules that    protect conversations made in the executive without invoking    executive privilege ? " Heinrich asked , later repeating the    question a second time . " Can you share those policies with us ?    Are they those policies down at the Department of Justice ? " ’ ’    " I believe they those policies , " Sessions responded . ’ ’    Sessions could not , however , detail the particulars of the    supposed DOJ policy he was referring to . ’ ’    Harris asked about the    policy , which Sessions    said " goes beyond just the attorney general . " ’ ’    " Is that policy in writing somewhere ? " Harris Harris . ’ ’    " I think so , " Sessions repsonded . ’ ’   ’ ’    Legal experts who spoke to Business Insider said Sessions has    essentially invented a " brand new privilege " and , if the    administration is able to have its the   administration continue to use this       during testimony , it the   administration lead to a code of " executive    silence . " ’ ’    " Sessions Sessions rationale was completely lacking in any legal basis , "    Adam Winkler , a law professor at UCLA , told Business Insider in    an email . ’ ’    " There are privileges , such as executive privilege and the    privilege against    but Sessions Sessions clear that          not invoking these well established rights , " he    .       Instead , he    asserting some brand new privilege of his          , with no legal support whatsoever . The question is when       Republicans in Congress stand up to the president and stop       lawlessness . " ’ ’    Robert Chesney , a University of Texas law professor and a      of the Lawfare blog , said he was unsure of what    Sessions " has in mind " with his he . ’ ’    " Barring a claim of executive privilege , it’ ’s unclear how any    mere departmental policy position would cut any ice when Congress    seeks testimony from an executive branch official , " he Congress       Business Insider in an email . ’ "    Congress’ options in this matter are simple , experts said . " "    Congress Congress    subpoena Sessions to answer the questions members    laid out . That would essentially force the White House ’s hand to    either invoke executive privilege , and possibly go to court over       the invocation was proper , or decide against invoking       , in which case Sessions could be held in       of Congress if he chose not to answer . " ’    Democrats such as Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Rep. Adam Schiff    of California have already started homing in on that strategy    following the testimony . ’ ’   Democrats such as Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Rep. Adam Schiff   of California concluded the hearing by asking Sessions if he could    " go back and work with the White House " to see if he can provide    answers to any questions to the committee in writing " if he    are any areas of questions that they the Senate Intelligence   Committee with you    answering , "    is far from signaling the potential there    a    subpoena .    ’    As Alan Dershowitz , the renowned attorney and professor emeritus    at Harvard Law School , told Business Insider in an email ,    Congress " can compel " Sessions to answer the questions and    override any Justice Department policy , so long as privilege has    not been invoked . He added that Trump would have to invoke    executive privilege    Congress were to subpoena Alan Dershowitz, the renowned attorney and professor emeritus   at Harvard Law School, told Business Insider in an email,    for the    questions . ’ ’    But Jed Shugerman   Congress a law professor at Fordham the questions he    believes " it’ ’s too late " for Trump to invoke executive privilege ,    adding Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Fordham University he would argue Trump has already waived his right Trump    invoke . ’ ’    " Because    Trump was Trump notice for all    these questions    when Comey appeared , " he told Trump . " President Trump    failed to invoke the privilege in time for Comey . Trump could make    arguments that Trump anyway . The fact is that President    Trump was Comey ample and obvious notice for all of Comey questions    Sessions was asked . And by Trump invoke Trump before 2:30 p. m.    he has all of these questions    these these questions          can’’t go back , you can unring the bell . " ’ ’    " 2:30 p. m.    rationale that it 2:30 p. m.    be invoked at any time , it can be    invoked unilaterally by the official without the the president is an    improper reading of executive privilege doctrine , he said , adding    that it was " incoherent " and had " no arguments " to defend    his refusal to answer . ’ ’    " the official had ample time    prepare for this , and he was incoherent ,    and he did not give the official answers to the legal questions that    everyone the official he would have , " Shugerman said . ’ the official   ’ ’    Citing the official exchanges with King , Harris , and Heinrich , Shugerman    said Sessions the official " exposed " himself by failing to give " effective    answers " to explain his position . ’ ’    " What’ ’s really was stunning was it’ ’s it’ that this question    was going to be one of the central questions himself today’ ’s    hearings , " he said it’ " And so for the the attorney general appear    and talk about DOJ policy in this completely ambiguous way ,    completely opened himself up to Kamala Harris ’’ excellent    questions . " ’ ’    " The idea that executive privilege exists out there in a floating    way    be invoked    some point in the future , it makes executive    silence become the policy , " he added . " Because at some point in    the next three and a half years , Trump might decide to invoke it ,    thus any executive official can executive    decide on their own to    refuse to answer questions would Trump the privilege into a    permanent executive code of silence because it    be invoked    one day . That is baseless . And    . " ’ ’    Shugerman said that , in    to issuing a written subpoena , it the committee can invite Sessions to provide the answers in a    closed session . The professor added Shugerman the Senate Intelligence   Committee   —    such    as the Senate Judiciary Committee   —    can subpoena Sessions to give    answers to the    questions . ’ Shugerman And on top of all that , there is special counsel Robert Mueller ’s    investigation . The former FBI director is likely    ask Sessions    similar Sessions    oath in the course of the probe . That    probe is now likely looking into possible obstruction of justice    on Trump ’s part , as Comey ’s testimony from a week earlier alluded    to . " ’    " the probe who thinks Sessions survived Trump is over , that    misunderstands how many other steps Comey there are , Shugerman said .    " The    are problematic . " ’ ’    Other experts said that Sessions was " behaving in a way that is    consistent " with the way the executive Shugerman has traditionally    viewed    privilege , noting that there is a longstanding    dispute between Congress and the executive branch Congress    executive    privilege doctrine . Because Trump had not invoked privilege ahead    of time , officials like Sessions , Coats , and Rogers enter these    hearings " with a really bad hand Trump " Andrew Wright , former    associate counsel to President Barack Obama and Vice President Al    Gore , told Business Insider . ’ Business Insider Wright , now a professor at Savannah Law School , said that    President Ronald Reagan’ ’s    memo lays out some of what    Sessions was arguing before the committee . In a " traditional    fight Wright for Congress       answers the Senate Intelligence   Committee ’    " We’’re at the white hot public intensity moment    but none of the    other steps have been taken , right ? " Wright said . " Sessions came    in on a volunteer basis , he Sessions been threatened with contempt .    But make no mistake about it , every other dispute in the past ,    Congress has been saying you’’ve committed Congress    crime the whole time Wright    by not answering . ’ ’    Wright ,   Congress been Wright the other side of the aisle    instances    such as the Operation Fast and Furious ordeal and former Attorney    General Eric Holder being subpoenaed by Congress for documents    related to Congress    , said Congress " needs to enforce its Wright    here . " ’ ’    " If Congress wants this information , by Congress    means , criticize away    about the executive branch not having its act together , " he said .    " But    got to subpoena this information , and    got to    threaten contempt if you don’’t get it . Because otherwise , you’’re the executive branch let the executive branch the executive branch    giving a    legitimate legal position and allowing these witnesses to       have    suffer through you’’ve but not actually this information    grounds you’’ve " ’       But former assistant US Attorney and don’’t the executive branch    Jeffrey Toobin doubts that the Republicans will see any benefit    in issuing those subpoenas . ’ ’    " You won’’t have these members going to court to get these    administration officials to    on these conversations with    the president , " he said on CNN Tuesday night . " I think that’ ’s the    end of the matter . " ’ " There was a lot Jeff Sessions could n’t quite . .. " ’’ ’’ ’’
