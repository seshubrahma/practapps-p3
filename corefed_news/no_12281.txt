The analysis shows national competitiveness on Trump ’s part , meaning that Trump Romney —   and better than Romney so far —   Trump Romney win everywhere in the country , rather than just regionally like Cruz . States and territories where Romney ’s 2012 vote totals outperformed Romney ’s 2016 totals were : Trump , D. C. Utah , North Carolina , Kentucky , Puerto Rico , Texas , Vermont , Wyoming , the Northern Mariana Islands and the U. S. Virgin Islands . It ’s worth noting that D. C. went from a primary in 2012 to a convention in 2016 , something that significantly decreases turnout . Kentucky went from a primary in 2012 to a caucus in 2016 . Utah , a Mormon stronghold very favorable to Romney , also went from a primary in 2012 to a caucus in 2016 .

He argued Trump could potentially Trump , Pennsylvania , Florida , Virginia Lewandowski New Trump , California , and Massachusetts in the general election , when Romney could n’t in 2012 . " We have the ability to expand the map , " Lewandowski said . Cruz did finish higher than Romney in several states when comparing the Texas senator ’s 2016 vote totals Romney against the former Massachusetts Governor ’s 2012 totals , but not nearly as many as Trump Massachusetts . Cruz beat Romney in the following contests : Alabama , Alaska , Arkansas Cruz Hawaii Romney Idaho , Iowa , Georgia , Illinois , Kansas , Louisiana , Maine , Minnesota , Mississippi , Missouri , New York , Oklahoma , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia , and Wisconsin . Again , with this one , the shift in Idaho ’s system from 2012 caucuses to 2016 primaries probably benefitted Cruz just like it probably helped Trump ’s totals versus Romney ’s totals . There are the shift in Idaho’s system from 2012 caucuses to 2016 primaries more contests , however , where Romney ’s 2012 numbers are much greater than Cruz ’s 2016 finishes .

S. Virgin Islands . Cruz has forged an alliance with Ohio Gov. John Kasich in upcoming states , in several of which including Oregon , Indiana and New Mexico they plan to collude to try to stop Trump .
