" Karl asked . ’ ’    Spicer said that Spicer intention was " never to lie " to reporters    and that the administration and journalists could " disagree on    the facts . " ’ ’    " There are times we believe something to be true or we get    something from an agency or we act in haste because the    information available wasn’’t complete , but we desire is to    communicate with the American people and make sure you have the    most complete story at the time , so we do it , " Spicer said . ’ ’    " I’’m going to come out here and tell you the facts as I know    the facts , and if I make a mistake , I’’ll do my best to correct it , " I’’ll    added . ’ "    The size of the crowd at Friday ’s inauguration became a source of    debate after Trump said on Saturday that more than 1 million    people attended . " "    There are no official government estimates of the crowd size , but    independent   put it at closer to 250 , 000 attendees , while     and photographs comparing Trump ’s    inauguration with past inaugurations suggested that the number    was far lower than the White House claimed .

" ’    " You’’re in the same boat . There are times when you tweet    something out or you write a story and you publish a correction .    That doesn’’t mean that you were intentionally trying to deceive    the American people , does it ? " Spicer said . " And I think that we    should be afforded the same opportunity . " ’ ’    Spicer said that the information Spicer was provided on Saturday ,    which was given to Spicer by the inaugural committee , " came from an    outside agency , " and Spicer highlighted the millions of people who    watched on TV and streaming services . ’ ’    The press secretary said that The press secretary never claimed that the    inauguration had the largest    audience , saying The press secretary always    meant the total audience of viewers for the   inauguration . ’ ’    " I didn’’t say in person   —    both in person and around the globe to    witness it , " Spicer said . " I don’’t know how I could interpret    that differently . That’ ’s literally what I said , to witness it it both in person and around the the globe " ’ ’    Later in the press conference , Spicer said Spicer it was " not about    the crowd size , " citing commentary and punditry suggesting that    Trump    not win key states in the 2016 election . ’ ’    " There is this constant theme to undercut the enormous support    that he has    " Spicer said Spicer " And I think it is unbelievable    frustrating    you’’re told it’ ’s not big enough , it’ ’s it’ good    enough , you can’’t win .

Today was not normal .   ’ ’    During an appearance on CBS on Monday , Ari Fleischer , a press    secretary for President George W. Bush , urged Spicer to correct Spicer his error . President George W. Bush ’    " It concerns me . It’ ’s one thing to take on the press   —    that’ ’s a      tradition in Washington , DC , " Fleisher said .
