’   ’ "    President Donald Trump has made some huge promises for healthcare    overhaul , but President Donald Trump new guarantee for people with preexisting    conditions may not reflect the reality of the GOP ’s current    legislation . " ’    President Donald Trump has promised that the plan to repeal and replace the    Affordable Care Act , the law also known as Obamacare , will bring    down premiums , deductibles , and the cost to the government , and    will eventually cover " everybody . " ’ ’    Most    experts agree that hitting all four of these    marks is next to impossible . ’ ’    Now , with the White House and congressional leaders apparently    readying an effort to bring the American Health Care Act to the    House floor , Trump is making another promise that is contradicted    by the actual legislation . ’ ’    In an   on Sunday , Trump guaranteed protections for patients with preexisting conditions ,    something    has done since the campaign . ’ ’’ ’    " Preexisting conditions are in the bill , " Trump Trump . " And I just    watched another network than yours , and they another network than yours saying ,    ’’ Preexisting is not covered . ’’ Preexisting conditions are in the the bill And I mandate it . I the bill , ’’ Has to be . ’’ " ’ ’    Trump Trump those comments during   on Monday , saying the AHCA has to    cover preexisting conditions just as well as or better than    Obamacare . ’ ’    " I want it to be good for sick people . It’ ’s not in its final form It’ right now , " Trump Trump . " It will be every bit as good on    preexisting conditions as Obamacare . " ’ ’    But those guarantees run in opposition to recent adjustments to    the AHCA . ’ ’    ’ ’    the bill written by moderate Republican Rep. Tom    MacArthur would allow states to   including aspects of    its    provisions that mandated states people who are    the same age be charged the same price by insurers . ’ ’    If a state were given a waiver for those protections , experts    agree that insurers could price   above those for healthy    people and , in the worst case ,   for people with preexisting conditions    to access insurance . ’ ’    Speaking with CBS , Trump said the addition of " pools " could    offset the issue . ’ ’    The new version of the AHCA would allow for the implementation of    an " invisible       , " which would function as a way to    subsidize insurers covering people    preexisting conditions to    keep costs down for    . ’ "    That could reduce costs for people without preexisting    conditions , but unless the government adequately funded the plan ,    it would   with higher    costs or unable to enroll . According to experts at the Kaiser    Family Foundation , a nonpartisan    think tank , the    current iteration of the AHCA ’s pools would . " "    In response to Trump ’s comments to Bloomberg , AshLee Strong , a    spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan , told NBC that the AHCA    would take care of people with preexisting conditions . " ’    " The Republican plan protects people with preexisting    conditions , " Strong said . " States can’’t opt out without a      pool to take care of them . And waivers never a     pool to    someone who has been continuously covered . We believe there is    more than one way    address this problem . " ’ ’    House Republicans are attempting to wrangle enough votes to pass    the AHCA at some point this week .
