Carey applauded Donald Trump for addressing veterans’ issues " as clearly and convincingly and repeatedly as Carey did . " " Carey talked about the real problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs , how it ’s in need of fundamental reform , and Carey talked to what all of these veterans are experiencing when these veterans do go to the Department of Veterans Affairs   —    which is basically a Byzantine bureaucracy that seems to be more interested in perpetuating their own jobs than these veterans care of veterans , " Carey said . " And then Carey also talked about national security issues in real , clear , and unequivocal manner , talking about the threat of terrorism and the need to build up our armed forces , " Carey continued . " Many of these veterans have recently come off active duty , where they go on five these veterans six , seven , eight deployments overseas to Iraq and Afghanistan . In large part , it ’s because they have this really these veterans deployment schedule because there ’s just not enough forces . And he talked about that Carey He talked about how Carey need to increase the size of our armed forces , we to meet our current commitments . we was first and foremost . " Carey said Trump has " laid out a    plan " for reforming the VA , calling it " one of his most complete and Carey policy initiatives .

" What you need is Trump’s who binds well with the    who understands what the    wants to do , and has the capacity in order to be able to carry that out , " he said . Carrying out that reform Trump’s will not be easy , as Carey spoke of a bureaucratic culture at the VA that is even more insulated from the consequences of failure and malfeasance than most government agencies .
