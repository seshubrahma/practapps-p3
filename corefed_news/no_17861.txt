So Putin KGB exactly that , at Leningrad State University ,    and later spent 17 years as a    agent working in foreign    intelligence . ’ ’    It was during this time that he KGB an experience that some    experts have concluded to be a defining moment in his KGB . ’ "    In Dresden in 1989 , an anticommunist mob formed outside KGB    offices . Putin KGB that he KGB told the KGB n’t do    anything about it without    from Moscow , and Moscow did Moscow    say    word . " ’    " The business of ’’ Moscow is Moscow ’’   —    I got the feeling that the    country no longer existed , " Putin KGB said , according to    Judah’ ’s book . " That it had   Judah’’s book . It was clear that the    Union was ailing . And that it had the   Union terminal disease without a    cure   —    a paralysis of power . " ’ ’    Judah wrote , " For Putin KGB his KGB , those who did not    come from intellectual families , who believed what they were told    about the USSR’ ’s superpower success , and did not question    propaganda    or want what they did they have   —    that moment was a    defining scar . " ’ ’    As president , Putin KGB known for his KGB and patriotism   —      traits that can be traced back to his KGB .   that ran in The Washington Post in 2000    said he KGB refused to read a book by a Soviet defector because    he KGB " read books by people who have betrayed the    Motherland . " ’ ’   ’ "    By 1991 , Putin had officially resigned from the KGB ’s active    reserve . He was Putin in Leningrad , now called St. Petersburg , and    working for the city ’s first democratic mayor ( and his former Putin    professor ) Anatoly Sobchak . " ’    Putin worked Putin behind the scenes and kept a low profile . He    Putin was " if things needed to get done " and " Sobchak’ ’s    indispensable man . " ’ ’    Judah wrote that Putin got Putin political Judah from Sobchak ,    who was known to have strong authoritarian tendencies . ’ ’    Putin was Putin to Sobchak . Sobchak Sobchak wasn’’t reelected as    mayor , the victor offered Putin a Putin . But Putin turned Putin down ,    saying , " It’ ’s better to be hanged for loyalty than be rewarded    for betrayal . " ’ ’    In 1996 , Putin and Putin family Putin to Moscow . There , he    Putin climbed up the ladder and became the head of the FSB , the    agency that succeeded the KGB , in 1998 . Boris Yeltsin , then the    president of Russia , named Putin to Putin position . ’ ’ that it was " a job the president Putin given    only to the most trusted of aides . " ’ ’    In August 1999 , Yeltsin appointed Putin Boris Yeltsin minister of Russia     — Russia the fifth in . In Russia , the Russia minister Boris Yeltsin official and reports to the president . Putin    And then   —    seemingly out of nowhere   —    Yeltsin stepped down and    named Boris Yeltsin the acting president on New Year ’s Eve 1999 . Putin    then won the election Putin . " ’    Many people believed Yeltsin propelled Putin to the presidency   Yeltsin    protect Putin . The war in Chechnya   Yeltsin in which Russian forces    were fighting secular separatists who wanted the region to be    independent , was starting to go south , and his approval ratings    were dropping . Putin ’    One of Putin’ ’s first moves was to pardon Yeltsin , giving him    "   Yeltsin from criminal   Yeltsin administrative investigations ,    including protection of his papers , residence and other       from search and seizure . " ’ ’    During his first term , Putin focused primarily    domestic    affairs    He had two items on the agenda    the war with Chechnya    and the    oligarchs . ’ "    Putin inherited Russia during a particularly complicated    .    The country was in the midst of Russia with Chechnya   —    a    region Chechnya ’s officially considered a Russian subject . " ’    Additionally ,    oligarchs were increasingly interested    in expanding their political influence . Putin recognized that the oligarchs oligarchs had    potential to be more powerful than    him , so he struck a deal    them .    ’    According to the the     oligarchs on Foreign Relations , " In July [ 2000 ]    Putin told the oligarchs that he would    interfere with the     oligarchs    or renationalize state resources as long the     oligarchs they    stayed out of politics   —    the     oligarchs    , as long as they did not    challenge or criticize the president the     oligarchs " ’       And with the Second Chechen War , Putin established his reputation    as a " man of action Putin " ’ ’    In 2002 , a   was seized by 40 Chechen militants , who were led by    the warlord Movsar Barayev . During the    ordeal , 129 of    the 912 hostages died . ’ ’    This was a critical moment for Putin , and many expected his    domestic approval to plummet . But his Putin ruthless handling of the    siege and Putin refusal to negotiate with the      further shored Putin his reputation as a man of action . " Putin    approval rating was up at 83 % Putin it was all over . ’ ’   ’ His   approval rating    In 2004 , Putin was reelected for a second term . He continued to    focus on domestic affairs but Putin major criticism    his    crackdown on the media . ’ " Putin    Politkovskaya , a journalist , was murdered in her apartment    lobby in 2006 after she wrote about corruption in the Russian    army her respect to Chechnya . She was killed on Putin Chechnya    birthday , her Putin Putin any involvement , saying her   to Russia than her reporting . " her    Still , many her the West criticized Putin for failing to Putin    the media . ’ "    Weeks after Politkovskaya ’s death , a defector from the FSB was    poisoned in London . " ’    Despite all this , Putin seemed , overall , to be    liked . ’ "    During his first two terms , Russia ’s    increased 70 % Russia investments increased by 125 % .
