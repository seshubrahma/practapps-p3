Wednesday on MSNBC ’s " Morning Joe , " political correspondent Kasie Hunt said the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is describing Indiana is the candidate ’s " Alamo . "   political correspondent Kasie Hunt said , " Nice to see both of you this fine morning . Look both of you are presenting this as the Alamo . both of you say universally , privately , publicly even , Indiana is it . both of you are going to take the stand I think that there is a slim chance that if Cruz pulls that out there are going to be at least some people who stay on Cruz side , are willing to watch Cruz push it through to California . But you ’re right . Indiana is not Wisconsin . Cruz at the very least needs Indiana to be Wisconsin . You ’ve got all these top elected officials , Mike Pence , Mitch Daniels , other people sitting on the sidelines . Talk radio has been neutral . There are pockets of Indiana that have been hard hit by the economic crisis . There are manufacturing areas that are essentially perfect for Donald Trump . This is nowhere near a sure thing for Cruz . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
