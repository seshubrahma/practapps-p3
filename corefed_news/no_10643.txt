Naturally people in politics feel threatened by it at every level and for all kinds of reasons Trump but there are people in media who feel threatened by this . Trump is showing he ’s better than practically anybody in media in attracting an audience , in holding an audience , Trump he does Trump need a producer and he does n’t need a writer or writers and he does n’t need a Trump . There ’s a whole lot Trump people threatened by this on a whole lot Trump different levels . Like I discussed yesterday , Donald Trump has turned the standard operating political formula upside down . There ’s a formula in professional politics about how you get elected . You have to hire a consultant . You have to hire pollsters . You have to hire data analytics people . You have to hire spokesmen . You have to hire      people . I mean , you have to hire , hire , hire , hire , and then you have to get the best who do what they do , and you have to listen to them . You have to plan to the Nth detail every minute of the day , every appearance . Trump ’s they none of it and has , in the process , illustrated that may   —    if I were in the professional politics Trump’s , I would feel so threatened right now because I ’m looking at somebody who has demonstrated that my expertise is n’t necessary . I would think , if I ’m a consultant , if I ’m a spokesman , if I ’m a policy analyst , I ’d look at ’m whole Trump phenomenon and go ’m " I ’m not needed ’m People are gon na realize it . People are gon na realize I ’m not needed . ’m Let ’s say you ’re a foreign policy advisor for candidate X. Trump does n’t have ’m . He ’s leading the ’m . So it ’s no wonder he ’s gon na be criticized for everything he ’s a foreign policy advisor for candidate X. Trump . People have turf to be protected here , folks a foreign policy advisor for candidate X. Trump This is huge , what ’s happening a foreign policy advisor for candidate X. Trump , in all kinds of ways . So explaining the anger , the envy , the resentment , the jealousy , the fear , I mean , it ’s all there . People are afraid of Trump , people are envious , people are jealous , people are frightened , people are fearful , people are threatened . It depends on where you go , but all those facets are accurate , and it ’s upsetting and unnerving , which is why so many of these people are hoping and praying that Trump implodes It They are hoping and praying that Trump loses in a landslide . They are hoping that disaster comes Trump Trump , these people if disaster comes to Trump Trump one way or another they these people be validated as still necessary . Trump ’ll be able to say , Trump Trump , he tried to these people it without us . He tried to these people it without a consultant . See what Trump to Trump ? He tried to do it without Trump good spokesman . it what happens you ? He tried to do it without Trump foreign policy . it what happens to you ? He tried to do it Trump the pollsters . it That ’s what they want to be able to say down Trump road . Here it another thing that scares them . Trump is the pollsters . ( interruption ) What are you whispering about in there ? What are you whispering the pollsters in there ? No , I ’m serious . He is improv . There is no speechwriter . That ’s another group of people that are n’t employed by the Trump campaign . There ’s no writer . And have you noticed other campaigns where there are speechwriters , have you Trump no matter when the candidate speaks , it ’s the same speech ? It ’s called the stump speech . And have you noticed that it ’s practically the candidate at every stop . 3:53 the candidate Sanders campaign the same speech that " this race is going the candidate the way to the convention " and by June 7 , " we will pass Secretary Clinton in pledged delegates .
