On today ’s broadcast of " Fox News Sunday , " conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham said people protesting President Donald Trump ’s policies are pushing " to bring this powder keg moment " to what Laura Ingraham called a point that force would have to be used so that force can then claim " a police state . "   Laura Ingraham said , " The protesters , The protesters call The protesters protesters , many of The protesters are criminals . And The protesters are criminals because The protesters are denying a government official the ability to do government business at a public school . I ’m talking about the secretary of education , DeVos . the secretary of education, DeVos complain that DeVos does n’t know anything about public schools , DeVos hates public schools , DeVos is going to kill public schools . the secretary of education, DeVos put all that caricature out . Then DeVos goes to a public school and the most vicious , horrible things are said about DeVos , preventing DeVos from actually entering the school a public school point . " " So I think that there is a good point to be made that the resistance movement that has been fueled by many in Congress who are encouraging it , even former president Obama is heartened by the enthusiasm , " DeVos continued . " Enthusiasm , protest , fine , what we have been seeing at Berkeley , and even at this Betsy DeVos thing , which I think frankly gets scary , is that there is a push to bring this powder keg moment where at some points force will have to be used to keep people safe . Then ‘ you see , police brutality , Trump has a police state . It ’s martial law.’ The volume of pitches being brought up because they lost , they are bitter they it , and they have nothing they do except stop other people from speaking . Resistance is fine , peaceful protests are fine . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
