Donald Trump posted one of Donald Trump biggest wins on Super Tuesday in Alabama , winning Alabama by more than 20 points . Donald Trump campaign , fueled by animosity towards the political establishment in Washington , however , provided no lift to two    challengers to Republican incumbents . [ Both candidates , despite signficant backing from Tea Party groups , were crushed by their Both candidates opponents . Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby , who has been in the Senate for almost 30 years , won 64 percent of the vote against challenger John McConnell and three other opponents . If Shelby had been held to under 50 % of the vote , the race would have been pushed to a   . Despite the crowded field , Shelby Shelby cleared that hurdle .   In Alabama Alabama 2nd Congressional District , Rep. Martha Roby fended off a challenge from Tea Party heroine Becky Gerritson and one other challenger . Roby Rep. Martha Roby 67 percent of the the vote far above the threshold needed to avoid a runoff . Gerritson , who founded the Wetumpka Tea Party , received national attention when she testified before Congress after her organization she targeted by the IRS . She racked she    endorsements from Phyllis Schafely , Herman Cain , Allen West , Citizens United , Madison Project , and Tea Party Patriots Citizen Fund . Rep. Roby received strong backing from the U. S. Chamber of Commerce and many other    interests . McConnell , a former Captain in the U. S. Marines , was endorsed by Citizens United Citizens United Tea Party organizations Tea Party national Tea Party Patriots Citizens Tea Party however , broke ranks with other conservative groups and endorsed Sen. Shelby . Sen. Jeff Sessions endorsed both Sen. Shelby and Rep. Martha Roby . Sessions , of course , also endorsed Donald Trump , putting the Senator ’s firm stamp on the state ’s politics . It is obviously difficult to beat incumbents in any environment . The electorate that delivered the state to Trump by the state’s , Donald Trump , seems to have been created to challenge any incumbent . According to exit polls , 42 percent of Republican voters on Tuesday are " angry " with the federal government . Another 42 percent are simply " dissatisfied " with the government . Amazingly , though the federal government solid majority of Republicans , 52 percent , say they feel " betrayed " by the a solid majority of Republicans, 52 percent party and its leaders . By an overwhelming majority the federal government 68 percent , Republicans said they wanted a " political outsider " Republicans their candidate for President . This seems Republicans electorate    for a challenger , especially when the immediate goal is n’t to necessarily win outright , but to hold the incumbent to less than 50 percent . The challengers ’s failures present three possibilities : The results , however , also suggest that the animous building towards Washington is a little bit schizophrenic . It is simply hard to square a circle where voters back a candidate to clean house in Washington but simultaneously vote to repopulate Washington Washington the very same politicians . Washington democracy is very confusing sometimes .
