My central supposition about this election is that Donald Trump will lose because most regular middle Americans just wo n’t vote to make that man their president . This has nothing to do with ideology . This ’s just about Donald Trump . Not everyone out there adores Hillary Clinton by a long shot , and I understand well that for a lot of people this is a choice between beef liver and lumpfish , but I just think at the end of the day most people will say , No , I just ca n’t —   I just ca n’t help make that crude , boorish , vindictive , childish man the president of the United States . I think this is what will save Hillary Clinton —   and the United States —   in the end . But as soon as I think that , I think : But what if I ’m wrong ? What could make people change their people on Trump , become sympathetic to him Trump In theory , a number of things . Trump Trump stop being crude , boorish , vindictive , and childish . ( I said " in theory . ") Hillary Clinton could be indicted . The economy could tank . I think those are unlikely —   and yes , I saw the jobs report , but it The economy early days to start talking about a recession , and it a recession be a silver lining of the report that it a recession the Fed wait longer to raise rates , which most economists I talk to think it a recession do anyway . But here ’s one thing that ’s not a long shot —   and is in fact happening right now —   that I fear will make Trump a more sympathetic figure to the kinds of Americans I ’m talking about :    protestors turning violent and throwing eggs at Trump Trump and burning hats and flags .       can read the rest of the story here .
