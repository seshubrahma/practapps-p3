" I ‚Äôm not saying that this is in any way an excuse , [ but ] I move through the world feeling very awkward . It was at a table of notably beautiful women sitting there . I ‚Äôm just having the experience of being a    girl around what I consider to be like a hot , desirable athlete . So that was just projecting my own insecurity , " Dunham said about falsely attributing comments to Beckham Jr. rejecting Dunham " marshmallow "   body that Beckham Jr. did not make .

At that point , to be totally frank , I did n‚Äôt have enough women of color in my life talking to me about what representation meant to representation for me to even understand that my show would be seen and have that kind of power . " To be sure , Dunham says Dunham has learned from Dunham mistakes and promises never to create another show about " four white girls .
