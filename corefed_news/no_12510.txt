President Obama issued an executive order on Thursday sanctioning Russian intelligence officials , individuals , and organizations based on    unproven accusations that Russia interfered in the 2016 election by hacking the emails of Democratic Party officials . [ This action comes as the President Obama administration is heightening tensions between the United States and Russia on several fronts .   The new executive order signed by President Obama offers no new proof that Russia was involved in what it calls Russia tampering with , altering , or causing a misappropriation of information with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions . " In place of proof of these serious claims , the Obama White House said it will the Obama White House be providing a report to Congress in the coming days about Russia ’s efforts to interfere in our election , as well as malicious cyber activity related to our election cycle in previous elections . " After former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suffered a stunning loss in November ’s election , many    Democrats accused Russian " hacking " of interfering with the election our election Obama has explicitly stated there is no evidence of " vote tampering . " That leaves one possible avenue by which Russian " hackers " could have influenced the vote : the Wikileaks release of email archives from several Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) employees and Clinton ’s campaign chairman John Podesta . The New York Times reported that anonymous CIA employees believe Russia hacked both the DNC and RNC but selectively leaked emails from the DNC to Wikileaks to turn Wikileaks opinion against    Clinton . Clinton Clinton Wikileaks that Russia was the source Russia these published emails , and no one has produced evidence to confirm the anonymous CIA claims . The House Intelligence committee has still not been briefed on the specific proof , if any , that links Russian espionage agencies to the hacking of Democrat ’s official ’s emails , inside sources with knowledge of the matter told Breitbart News last week . The committee was told The House Intelligence committee to wait for the report to Congress to be issued to get the briefing , the source said . Reuters reported on December 16th that Representative Ron Johnson said , " It is disappointing that the CIA would provide information on this issue to the Washington Post and NBC but will not provide information to elected members of Congress " after Johnson was Congress a briefing Representative Ron Johnson the CIA . Obama said the CIA would impact " The GRU and the FSB , two Russian intelligence services four individual officers of the GRU and three companies that provided material support to the GRU ’s cyber operations . the GRU the GRU follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government , and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U. S. interests in violation of established international norms of behavior , " President Obama said in a statement . Dmitry Peskov , spokesman to Russian President Vladimir Putin , denied that Russia was responsible for the alleged hacking . " We think that such steps by a U. Russia was responsible for the alleged hacking administration that has three weeks left to work are aimed at two things : to further harm    ties , which are at a low point as it is , as well as , obviously , to deal a blow to the foreign policy plans of the incoming administration of the " Peskov told reporters in Moscow . He denounced Obama ’s announcement as " unpredictable Peskov and " aggressive foreign policy . " The new executive order comes in the face of other    moves by the Obama administration just prior to Donald Trump taking the Presidential oath of office in the next few weeks . On December 16th , NBC News reported that the United States was sending tanks to Europe to " send a message " to Russia : Three years after the last American tank left Europe , they are being brought back " Europe part of our commitment to deterrence , " Gen. Frederick " Ben " Hodges told NBC News . Hodges , who is commander of the U. S. Army in Europe , welcomed a batch of tracked and Europe support vehicles to a depot in the Netherlands on Thursday . NBC also reported about American boots on the ground just prior to Trump taking office , saying that in January , " The U. S. Army in Europe is due the U. S. Army in Europe troops and 2 , 000 military vehicles on a rotational basis to Poland , Romania , Bulgaria and the Baltic nations . " In another provocative move , Reuters reported a barrage of claims and    by U. S. and Russian officials over a new provision in the defense authorization bill signed into law by President Obama last week that the Russians claim would allow the U. S. to supply    weapons to the    rebels in Syria . As Reuters reported , Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the move by Obama a " hostile act " Russian said in a statement : Washington has placed its President Obama on supplying military aid to    forces who do n’t differ that much from Washington thirsty head choppers . Now , the possibility of supplying them with weapons , including mobile    complexes , has been written into this new bill . U. S. policy has been to not officially supply the Syrian rebels with    air defense system , or MANPADS . Although the official policy of the United States is to not supply    weapons to the Libyan opposition , there has been a great deal of reporting that the Obama administration was , in fact , supplying the weapons through the Central Intelligence Agency .   In 2013 , Michael B Kelley and Geoffrey Ingersoll reported that there was a " September shipment of         missiles ( i. e. MANPADS ) and    grenades from Benghazi to Syria through southern Turkey " and said it may have been connected to slain Ambassador Chris Stevens , who died in the September there was a "September shipment of        missiles (i. e. MANPADS) and   grenades from Benghazi to Syria through southern Turkey" , 2012 attack by jihadists on the Embassy House and CIA annex . The reporters connected the dots by saying : That    shipment   —    " the largest consignment of weapons " yet for Syrian rebels   —    was organized by Abdelhakim Belhadj , who was the    head of the Tripoli Military Council . In March 2011 Stevens , the official U. S. liaison to the     Libyan rebels , worked directly with Belhadj while he headed the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group .    Trump has repeatedly said he is open Trump terrorists in Syria .
