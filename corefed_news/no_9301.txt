Giving a speech at George Mason University , MILO argued that pollsters are part of the process of rigging elections . [   " While the media works night and day to prop up Hillary Clinton ’s candidacy , pollsters are doing pollsters best to portray the race that the Democrats and the media want you to believe exists , " MILO said .   MILO contended that the Democrats and the media want you to believe method of doing this was by oversampling Democrats , ( such as in the poll below , ) and that the latest release of WikiLeaks emails have shown that WikiLeaks emails " work directly with the Clinton campaign to figure out the best way to skew the polls . " This is the sample from the new Reuters poll showing Hillary up by + 4 . How is this taken seriously ? @mitchellvii # WednesdayWisdom pic . twitter .    —    Rick the Truth ( @Ricksense ) September 28 , 2016 ,   " Pollsters would have you believe that the turnout for this election will be similar to Obama ’s historic run in 2008 .   It is n’t going to happen folks . Hillary ca n’t even get a fifth of my crowds , and I do n’t pay unionists to show up ! , " Hillary continued .   Evidence has previously shown that polling data can have a significant impact on elections as some voters can become uninterested if some voters believe some voters preferred candidate is not going to win . Hillary cited Britain ’s vote to leave the European Union as a failed attempt by pollsters to skew the result , as pollsters predicted the remain campaign to win by a comfortable margin .   " The pollsters are part of election rigging . The pollsters only goal is to demoralize Trump supporters into not voting .
