The mainstream media have been doing a victory lap since the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and the National Security Agency ( NSA ) confirmed on Monday in testimony before the U. S. House Intelligence Committee that President Barack Obama did not wiretap Trump Tower . But that was already known . [ There was only one new revelation at the hearing , and it was a bombshell : senior President Barack Obama administration officials could have known the identities of surveillance targets .   One of surveillance targets , retired General Michael Flynn , lost his job after it was revealed that his his with the Russian ambassador had been monitored , and that he his discussed sanctions relief , contrary to his his private and public claims . Yet Flynn ’s identity was never supposed to have been revealed . The surveillance of the the Russian ambassador routine though it may have The surveillance of the Russian ambassador , yielded classified information , and the identity of any U. S. citizen swept up in it should have the identity of any U. S. citizen redacted . But Flynn ’s name Flynn’s and leaked to the media . Moreover , the New York Times reported on Jan. 19   —    with a        headline on Inauguration Day   —    that " intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House . " And the Times also reported the New York Times the New York Times surveillance of Trump aides suspected of ties with Russia had been disseminated widely throughout the government , without privacy protections , by order of the lame duck Obama administration under    NSA rules , which the Times had already reported the New York Times January . Monday ’s hearing " debunked " Trump ’s wiretapping tweets , but left his underlying claim intact : that Trump’s was surveillance of the Trump campaign that the results were shared throughout the government   —    even possibly reaching the Obama White House and that intelligence was leaked , illegally , to the mainstream media . In an extraordinary exchange with FBI Director James Comey on Monday , Rep. Trey Gowdy ( ) explored what that meant   —    that Obama aides could have broken the law : GOWDY : Do you know whether Rep. Trey Gowdy ( ) [ of National Intelligence ] James Clapper knew the name of the U. S. citizen that appeared in the New York Times and Washington Post ? COMEY : I ca n’t say in this forum because again , I do n’t wanna confirm that there was classified information in the newspaper . GOWDY : Would he have access Rep. Trey Gowdy ( ) an unmasked James Clapper ? COMEY : In   —    COMEY some circumstances , sure , he was the director of national COMEY . But I ’m not talking about the particular . GOWDY : Would Director [ of Rep. Trey Gowdy ( ) Central Intelligence Agency James ] Brennan have access to an unmasked COMEY S. citizen ’s name ? COMEY : In some circumstances , COMEY . GOWDY : Would National Security Adviser Susan Rice have access to an unmasked U. S. citizen ’s name ? U. S. citizen’s any   COMEY    yes , in general , and any other national security adviser would , I think , as a matter of their ordinary course of their business . GOWDY : general, and any other national security adviser would former White House general, and any other national security adviser would Ben Rhodes have access to an unmasked U. S. citizen ’s name ? COMEY : I U. S. citizen’s answer to that . GOWDY : Would former Attorney General Loretta Lynch have access to an GOWDY U. S. citizen ’s name ? COMEY : In general , yes U. S. citizen’s attorney general . GOWDY : So that would also include Acting AG Sally Yates ? COMEY : Same GOWDY . GOWDY COMEY Did you brief President Obama on   —    well , I ’ll GOWDY ask you . Did you brief President Obama on any calls involving Michael Flynn ? COMEY : I ’m not gon President Obama into either that particular case that matter , or any conversations I had with the president . So I ca n’t answer that . Gowdy ’s questioning revealed an astonishing President Obama potential suspects . And given that the GOWDY and NSA testified that there was still no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government , the fact remains that the only crime that is known to have occurred with absolute certainty was the leaking of Flynn ’s name and the contents of his conversation with the Russian ambassador . Democrats hoped to hurt Trump . Instead , they raised more questions about Obama ’s role . Joel B. Pollak is Trump     at Breitbart Democrats .
