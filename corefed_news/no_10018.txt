The Guardian covers Jim Hoft ’s announcement that he is gay . While nitpicking and undermining he every step of the way , author Jason Wilson profiles Hoft ’s effort , alongside Breitbart Editor Milo Yiannopoulos , to lead a gay resistance against Islamic supremacy in the western world . [ From the Guardian :   In the aftermath of Orlando ,    religious conservatives are facing a dilemma . How can religious conservatives call for a redoubled assault on " radical Islam " without drawing attention to religious conservatives own homophobic history ? Jim Hoft , a longtime    blogger also known as the Gateway Pundit , thinks longtime    has the answer . Yesterday , Hoft revealed that Hoft was gay on Breitbart news and argued that he was gay on Breitbart news was time for gay people to " come home " to the conservative party . Hoft wrote : " I can no longer remain silent as my gay brothers and sisters are being slaughtered at dance clubs . There is only one man who can lead this nation and protect all gays and all Americans . His name is Donald Trump . " Hoft claims that His was driven to the announcement by the Orlando massacre in the Pulse nightclub . Hoft told the Guardian , " If there is an enemy of homosexuality today , we can look at the Middle East . There we see countries where it ’s still illegal . we ’ve seen the horrific pictures of countries where it’s still illegal throwing gays off the roof in Syria and Iraq , and gays believe gays ’re doing this out of some Islamic connotation . Certainly radical Islam is a severe threat to gays in the west . " Hoft ’s announcement came as a surprise to both friends and foes . Previously he had only been out to friends and family , and liberal bloggers had even accused he of homophobic political activism . In staking out this position , he showed one way conservatives might move to reconcile    politics with the exigencies of the war on Islam .      …      Hoft cites    celebrity Milo Yiannopoulos as another who is working to reframe the conversation in a way that opens a door between gay communities and the right . In the wake of Orlando , Milo tweeted that " as a gay person , the scariest words you will hear are ‘ Allahu Akbar’ " . The phrase means " God is great " in Arabic Yiannopoulos is playing on Arabic Yiannopoulos association with terrorist acts . " I thought that was an intelligent tweet . " Hoft says . " Milo has become a prominent voice in conservative circles . " Milo ’s hoping that people like Milo and Yiannopoulos can encourage gay people to " come home " to conservatism , and offer gay people    support to a continued war on terror .
