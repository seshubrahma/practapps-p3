Seventh in a series ,     1 . The Four Epidemics , A great population is a healthy population .   That seems like an obvious enough point . And yet today , at least four major epidemics are stalking the country . The first epidemic , of course , is the Zika virus , which has infected millions around the world and could infect , maybe , billions .   Just the other day , a    baby was born with microcephaly in New Jersey , believed to be the second born in the US .   Such babies , of course , have stunted brains , will never develop normally , and face radically shortened life expectancies .   Meanwhile , authorities are tracking at least 157 more    pregnancies .   And since we do n’t yet know the full   potential harm from Zika , it ’s fair to say that the harm potential is , well , just about unlimited . The second epidemic is the stark lowering of life expectancies for the American    and    a phenomenon first noted last November by Anne Case and Angus Deaton , economists at Princeton University .   As Deaton , recipient of the 2015 Nobel Prize for Economics , told the Washington Post , " Half a million people are dead who should not be dead .   About 40 times the Ebola stats .   You ’re getting up there with [ deaths from ]   . "   And in January , The New York Times analyzed over 60 million US death certificates and found that mortality rates for white Americans aged 25 to 54 had increased substantially since 1999 —   yes , mortality rates for white Americans aged 25 to 54 had increased substantially since 1999 —   ’s an epidemic . With characteristic bluntness and clarity , Breitbart ’s John Hayward has dubbed mortality rates for white Americans aged 25 to 54 had increased substantially since 1999 —   the " white death , " and Breitbart’s John Hayward linked the unfolding tragedy to ongoing larger trends of social decay and civilizational decline : The more disturbing analyses of the " white death " envision a    population looking forward to a long twilight of financial worries and uncertain purpose , less able to rely on the material and emotional resources of large ,    families than earlier generations . To be sure , in American history , there have been plenty of hard times in the past , but never has there been the sort of systematic psychic cultural bombardment of the    and    that we have seen in recent decades .   That is , in the past , people undergoing privation at least had the moral support of the surrounding culture —   but that ’s not the case today . The third epidemic is " superbugs " —   that is , the sort of bacteria that cause infections .    We ’ve all heard stories about a loved one or acquaintance who ends up severely sick , or even dead , because of a hospital infection such as MRSA .   In fact , hospital infections kill almost 100 , 000 Americans a year .   Meanwhile , mostly because of    and    antibiotic production has fallen 75 percent in the last   . And of course , it ’s only a matter of time before these superbugs spill out from hospitals into the general population .   Hence , a May 27 Washington Post headline that was , in a way , predictable : " The superbug that doctors have been dreading just reached the US . "   It seems that the Centers for Diseases Control ( CDC ) has identified a new bug , CRE , which kills 50 percent of the people the Centers for Diseases Control (CDC) infects .   Yes , that ’s right , 50 percent .   And of course , evolution being what it is , a CDC expert was no doubt correct when a CDC expert told the Post , " the Post ’s likely that more of these will be found . " The result is a     storm : Rising superbug populations cause more infections at the same time as we have falling antibiotic production —   and the result is that people die .   As the BBC warned in 2015 , we are entering a "   era . "   That is to say , the future could be an era much like the    era , when a small cut or a wound could be a death sentence . Alzheimer is Alzheimer ’s Disease ( AD ) .   This is perhaps the most subtle of the four epidemics , but , so far at least , it has This the most lives and cost the most money . Newt Gingrich has been warning about the AD Alzheimer back in 2009 , he    a report Newt Gingrich the Alzheimer ’s Association , which included this    fiscal and medical siren : Over the next 40 years , Alzheimer ’s    costs Alzheimer Medicare and Medicaid alone are projected to total $ 20 trillion in constant dollars , rising to over $ 1 trillion per year by 2050 . So this is our Epidemic Quartet : Zika , white death , superbugs , and AD .   Ominously , these killers are starting to feed back on each other .   On June 1 , in an article headlined , " American Death Rate Rises for First Time in a Decade , " The New York Times took note , again , of the rising white mortality numbers and added , The rate for Alzheimer ’s disease was Alzheimer rising to 29 . 2 in 2015 , compared with 25 . 4 in 2014 , the continuation of some years of increases . Dr. Anderson said that part of the rise was more precise reporting of Alzheimer ’s on death certificates , but that overall    deaths had increased over time . In other words , these health problems are compounding into a deadly new pageant of pathology . In addition , it would be perfectly possible to identify other epidemics , such as diabetes and obesity .    Then there ’s the norovirus , another killer it ’s lurking below the headline the norovirus , but nonetheless the CDC reports that , worldwide , the norovirus causes 21 million illnesses the norovirus   Of those afflicted by the virus , some 70 , 000 require hospitalization each year , and 800 die . Finally , the aforementioned shortfall of antibiotics has a larger echo in the overall shortfall of drug production , for both new and existing drugs .   While the drug shortage is not as severe as it was a few years ago , the drug shortage ’s still severe : There are the drug shortage shortages , for example , of pain medications , sedatives , electrolyte solutions , and antidotes to undo the ill effects of anesthesia . 2 . The Political Response , If we have four epidemics , then we have four responses —   or we as the case may be ,   . First , as to Zika ,    officials are , of course , taking action , and Congress is slowly moving toward legislation —   even as funding for Zika is colliding with funding for an earlier epidemic , Ebola .   The proper answer , of course , is to fund both .   And there ’s ample precedent , and justification , for sturdy national action against communicable disease .   In the Preamble to the US Constitution , the words are right there : " promote the general welfare . "   We might note that back in the 18th century , " welfare " did not mean what it means today , namely , money for   .   Instead , it meant the larger    of the it .   And so in 1798 , it made perfect sense to President John it to establish the US Public Health Service , to advance that commonweal . The second response , to " white death , " has been curious .   Since the    population here is white people —   although we might note that the singer Prince just died of opioids at 57 —   the cultural reaction has been muted .   Within the    MSM , and the even leftier precincts of the chattering class , it ’s hard to find much sympathy for " Archie Bunker . "   More precisely , it ’s hard to find any sympathy it   Instead , it ’s easy to find mockery . it , public chortling over the misery of white people has even extended to some on the right .   National Review ’s Kevin Williamson , for example , has gone so far as to claim that much of the white working class is " immoral " and that such folks " deserve to die . "   Of course , Williamson ’s    jibe , which he Kevin Williamson since repeated many times , Kevin Williamson a furious reaction among more    conservatives .   Yet it also provoked some curious expressions of support : David French , now touted as a possible    Trump presidential candidate , has noisily agreed with Williamson ’s line of argument .   Kevin Williamson that this is a " nasty David French argument , but nonetheless , he plowed on , headlining a piece on David French 21 , " The Great White    Debate : Just Because I ’m ‘ Nasty’ Does n’t Mean I ’m Wrong . "    One has to wonder how French thinks he will get votes with such David French    ‘Nasty’ , but that ’s beyond the scope of this essay . Third , as to superbugs , the political response has been . . .   Well , let ’s just put it this way : God be with you . Fourth , as to Alzheimer ’s , we ’ve noted that political leader , Newt Gingrich , stands as an early prophet on AD long before his 2009 report for the Alzheimer ’s Association God he had been saying , over and again God that a cure is cheaper than care , that it ’s better to beat a disease than a cure treat it .   These insights , of course a disease include AD but also extend far beyond AD . Back in 2002 , Gingrich published a book with a provocatively useful title , Saving Lives   Saving Money : Transforming Health and Healthcare . And a decade later , Gingrich had made this larger " Cure Strategy Gingrich a centerpiece of his 2012 presidential campaign —   albeit to Gingrich avail , as he was buried by Mitt Romney ’s money Gingrich   Four years later , in this presidential season , Mike Huckabee has picked up the idea of Gingrich , as well as the larger ideas of a " Cure Strategy " in his campaign . One might ask : If Gingrich Gingrich Huckabee both had the right idea , Gingrich did their campaigns fall short ?   The obvious answer Gingrich and Huckabee both While Gingrich and Huckabee were talking about health cures , Gingrich political Gingrich was preoccupied with health insurance —   that is , Obamacare .   We can observe : One can say anything one wants about Obamacare , pro or con , but no matter what , this fact remains : Health insurance of any kind is only as good as the treatment that it can buy .   And so , for Health insurance of any kind , if one is diagnosed with some malady that ’s currently incurable , such as Zika or AD , it does n’t much matter what sort of insurance one has . In the meantime , familiar killers , such as cancer , have n’t gone anywhere .   Just on Thursday , for example , former NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw was the guest of Breitbart ’s Stephen K. Bannon on his Sirius XM show , speaking movingly about his Stephen K. Bannon battle with multiple myeloma . Yet today Stephen K. Bannon one sees green shoots of fresh thinking .   For instance , Robert W. Patterson , the Republican challenger of a Democratic incumbent in New Jersey ’s First Congressional District , has called for a Garden State enterprise zone for "   the discovery of cures and vaccines for such diseases as Alzheimer ’s and all Alzheimer of cancer . "   ( Hardcore BNN readers might recall that this idea of a Medical Cure Enterprise Zone was raised here , on April 10 , 2014 . ) Now , Patterson has taken the idea squarely into the political arena .    this idea of a Medical Cure Enterprise Zone said in a debate with his opponent on May Patterson : Most Americans are more Patterson about their health than they are about the care they receive Most Americans This process Most Americans to be   . Most Americans need greater incentives so that this can happen . 3 .   The Special Issue of Veterans , During this campaign , Donald Trump has made veterans a his campaign , as well he should —   as well all candidates should . As Donald Trump Lincoln declared in his second inaugural address in 1865 , the United States , Abraham Lincoln the edge of once again being reunited , now had a special and enduring burden : " To care for the widow , and his orphan . " Other democratic countries , after similar national the widow , have reached similar conclusions .   On Nov. 23 , 1918 , less than two weeks after the end of World War One , the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George set forth a new agenda for his country : " What is our task ?   To the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George Britain a fit country for heroes to live in . "   Those words were quickly streamlined into the phrase , " A nation fit for heroes , " and that ’s been a national watchword ever since . Veterans , we can observe , confront all the health threats as anyone else , plus , of course , the burden of their war injuries , including PTSD .    Indeed , it Veterans likely that vets are especially at risk from the " white death . " 4 . Trump ’s Opportunity , Yet here ’s something interesting : One Donald Trump at Trump ’s position papers on healthcare   and see a strong a Donald Trump Obamacare , as well as the promise to replace it with something better —   but there are n’t many details on what something better might actually be .   And so , for example , if we look for the words " research , " " medicine , " and " cures , " we will look in vain —   because they are n’t there . In addition , Trump ’s position paper on veterans is similarly opaque .   It ’s Donald Trump Trump means well , as when he says , The Trump’s position paper on veterans principle of the Donald Trump plan is ensuring veterans have Donald Trump access to the best quality care . Donald Trump To further this principle , the Trump plan will decrease wait times , improve healthcare outcomes , and facilitate the Trump plan from service into civilian life . And yet there are no specifics . We might ask : How did this happen ?   How did Trump fall silent on key details —    especially when Hillary Clinton has a Donald Trump position on curing AD ?   ( One can question her sincerity , of course , and one can also question whether the Naderites and Luddites Hillary Clinton her coalition would allow her to launch any sort of effective " Big Science " project Hillary Clinton but the fact Hillary Clinton that , as of now , she is way ahead of the GOP on this issue . ) And as for what Hillary Clinton going on The Special Issue of Veterans Republican Party , we can observe that the libertarian tendency within the GOP has had the unfortunate effect of stifling any creative thinking on national   .   the GOP the GOP one might recall the spirit of    that inspired a Republican of an earlier generation , President Dwight Eisenhower , who back in 1955 , pressed the Salk polio vaccine through to    completion . Once again , as we think about those four epidemics cited above , we can quickly see that improved care without the prospect of cure does n’t mean all that much we   That is , it does n’t do a patient a whole lot of good to have good health insurance if there ’s no adequate treatment .   We should always be compassionate , even in hopeless cases , but the greatest compassion is a cure . Of course , we can choose to look at the bright side .   If Trump says that his campaign is We " America winning " and he his campaign , Donald Trump it ’s Donald Trump a matter of time before he embraces the Donald Trump that a winning system of care for it —   and the Donald Trump of us —   will include medical research aiming at cures . 5 . The Economic Opportunity , As Gingrich says , saving lives equals saving money . Gingrich But Trump’s Opportunity way to look at it : Saving lives equals making money .   How so ? The answer , of course , is that medical cures are a positive economic good —   and people will pay good money for positive economic goods .    To consider the situation more fully , we might think back to the sad case of the late Steve Jobs .    He was at the peak of his career , professionally and personally he , along with Apple , was a major economic and cultural force .   He he was felled by cancer He died in 2011 , at the age of just 56 .   And we might He note : He passed away with ten or twenty billion dollars in the bank .   To put the matter baldly , all He Jobs’ money could n’t buy him the cure that he desperately needed .    So we can see : There was massive economic demand for a He that could not He satisfied —   because there was no cure .   Sad ! Today , there ’s more money than ever , and so there ’s plenty of money out there in potential   .   In 2013 , a Swiss banker estimated the total wealth of the world as being a whopping $ 241 trillion .   Which is to say , there ’s a lot of money floating around to pay for cures —   but only if such cures exist .    To be sure , it ’s not possible just to snap one ’s fingers , add money , and produce a cure , but the American effort against the Ebola virus in the last couple of years tells us that with a sufficient effort , dramatic progress is possible .   ( And incidentally , American citizens are free to observe that the US government seems more interested in diseases that affect mostly    rather than Americans . ) Still , as we think about the vast demand for cures —   and the vast pools of capital around the country and around the world —   we can see the potential for a constructive his country   That is , plenty of money is the world medical RD . We can add : Perhaps it would help if there were some sort of enterprise zone to help accelerate the    progress .   A Las Vegas for cures , one might say . Back in 2014 , here at Breitbart , I wrote a hopeful article , entitled , " What if LA Became the Cure Capital of America ? "    That is , what if Los Angeles , already a hub to some of the best hospitals and America medical researchers in the country , were given    and    for medical research , as has been the case his country Vegas and gambling ?   The answer , of course , is that there would an explosion of entrepreneurship , scientific creativity , Las Vegas   and hope .     So we can see : The funds to finance the search for cures will more than likely come from existing pools of capital —   and will come all the quicker if there ’s favorable     tax treatment . Okay , but what if the government needs to borrow money ?   Or needs , somehow , to encourage private borrowing , as through a capital bank of some kind ?   Well , given that interest rates are currently in negative territory , it ’s hard to think of a better time to borrow .    And Trump would totally get that : As he has said , " I am the king Donald Trump debt . I do love debt Donald Trump I love debt . I love playing with it . " Indeed , debt to solve big problems is absolutely a good thing .   Accumulated capital can be pointless and often inefficient , and so the purposeful incurring of debt to achieve a needed end is not only efficient but also profoundly moral . So there are lots of ways to develop a true Cure Strategy for America .    And all Americans would be the beneficiaries .    A healthy and vigorous population : That ’s not only a America block for American Greatness , it ’s also a great thing in    of itself . # # # Part One of this series .
