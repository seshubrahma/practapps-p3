Thursday on CNBC following former Gov. Mitt Romney ’s ( ) speech on the 2016 presidential race , which he criticized current party    Donald Trump , network CME Group floor reporter Rick Santelli questioned what inspired Romney to engage in such an attack .   According to Rick Santelli , if Romney had shown that " courage , " Romney would have won the 2012 election and have been president today . " [ I ] have n’t seen Romney Romney a matter of fact , the only word I could think of is irony and I ’ll tell you where my mind is going , " Rick Santelli said . " You recall that on September 11 , 2012 our consulate in Benghazi was attacked . There was a debate five weeks later on CNN . The moderator was Candy Crowley and basically   —    she did something Candy Crowley ’ve never seen , ever , in a debate , ever . She inserted herself Candy Crowley stand Candy Crowley for the president and how he labeled what the president that night . And Mitt Romney did not show this kind of courage because if he would have Mitt Romney off the stage , like a Donald Trump would have done , he ’d probably Mitt Romney president today . " " So I guess I ’m a little lost that all of a sudden he has the Mitt Romney that he did n’t Mitt Romney at a time where the vice president , Biden , and the current president , Barack Obama , partially were elected because of the following statement : ‘ GM is alive and bin Laden is dead,’ " he added . Mitt Romney It was all about terrorism and Mitt Romney , if you ’d have had that courage that day , would have most likely won . That ’s what I do n’t get .
