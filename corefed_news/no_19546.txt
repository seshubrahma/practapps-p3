’   ’ ’ "    ’ ’   ’ ’      To understand Trump , you have to set aside Trump gave Trump      his election Trump the   he has Trump since . You      also      to set aside the caricature of him as               woman hater who will deport every immigrant      he can      . Instead , look at the four interviews he has           since his election his election the Wall Street Journal , 60      Minutes , the New York Times , and a group of TV      anchors and executives . In these exchanges , all of them      conducted these exchanges the    context of the campaign ,      you ’ll see how squishy he is .        a   and he ’s a      to the country and the world . But      it ’s not because he ’s a      . It ’s because it ’s a      weakling .    ’ ’      That ’s the short version . The longer story is more complicated .      Here are the various facets of Trump ’s personality Trump  a   they      fit together , and why they make him dangerous they      ’ ’1 . He ’s all      reciprocal love . In the      campaign , Trump often played on Trump  a   and hate . He targeted      Muslims Trump  a   refugees , undocumented immigrants , and any other      scapegoat that served his interests . But Trump  a   down , what he      wanted was Trump  a   love of his adoring crowds . Trump  a   , he ’s a      Trump  a   . He can love others Trump  a   but only if they love him first others And Trump  a   that ’s how he sees his presidency Trump  a   In Trump  a     on Nov. Trump  a   , he explained that his Trump  a   is      Trump  a   taking care of the people that really have proven to be —   to      love Donald Trump . "    ’ ’2 . His reflexes are vindictive Trump  a   When Trump was      down Donald Trump the polls , he railed against Hillary Trump  a   , the      press , and fellow Republicans . On election night , he said those      Trump  a   were . But they were n’t . those     grudges        tweets , he    and the Trump  a   of . He       for      Trump  a   ongoing recounts , even after they   and      said they just wanted to they sure the recounts . He summoned TV      Trump  a   to Trump Tower on Nov. 21 ,   the " , " and       them for . The TV     executives next day , in his meeting with the Trump  a   , he bragged      that Trump  a   had stiffed job Trump  a   and pleas for campaign help      from two Republican Senate candidates who had failed to support      him . That      Trump  a   Trump behaves on his political honeymoon . Trump Imagine what he ’ll do when Trump going gets rough .    ’ ’   ’ ’3 . His ego is fragile Trump After winning the      Republican nomination in May , Trump gloated about it Trump      months the     Republican nomination in May Now he ’s gloating about Trump election . In tweets and      interviews , he has   that Trump beat Clinton      Trump . " On Tuesday , he ran      another Trump lap ,   the addition of      Michigan to his " . " Trump understand      how central this is to Trump ’s sense of Trump , check out Trump      first 19 paragraphs of his interview with the Trump .      Invited by the publisher to give opening remarks , Trump spoke      at Trump , not about the future but about his genius and      Trump on the campaign trail . In his Nov. 11 interview Trump       he      bragged about Trump number of Twitter followers he had gained . Trump ’ ’      A    who is    does n’t behave this way .      Nor does he snap at a Trump sketch comedy show . Nor does      he summon TV executives Trump complain that   they      have aired TV executives . Trump      does these things because he ’s deeply insecure Trump      easily      wounded .    ’ ’4 . He craves approval . Trump      often comes        Trump      as indifferent to the feelings of others . That ’s        misleading . He        intensely about Trump      respected and        loved . Consider        twisted relationship with Trump             Times . For two weeks after the election , he tweeted        that Trump      paper was " , " " , " and " . " Despite this , he requested a meeting Trump             showed up at the paper ’s offices the paper his tail . He Trump             Times Trump      an immigration bill that " even the        people in this room can be happy " with . He told them " Trump             would even the       people in this room , to me , a great Trump      if I could come back        here in a year or two years    …      and have a lot of the folks        here say , ‘ You ’ve done a great job.’ And I do n’t mean just a        conservative job , ’cause I ’m not talking conservative . I mean        just , we ’ve done a good job . " Yes , Mr. President . Good boy        ’ ’5 . He ’s easily soothed by flattery ’ ’5 Trump is        a champ at nursing grudges when he feels cheated , threatened , Trump or disrespected . But his grudges , like his commitments nursing grudges        be Trump out by small doses of affection . He speaks        glowingly of generous Trump phone calls        received        from the and Trump . He          in        return Trump Those threats to prosecute        ? . Trump also        ca n’t stop clucking about his Nov. 10 meeting with President        Trump also        . At least   Trump has         to have " " Trump also        the        man he had never previously met and had repeatedly denounced        as the .        That ’s        easily Trump ’s        can turn to warmth Trump also        and vice        versa .      ’ ’   ’ ’6 . He ’s a softie . If Trump hurts Trump also        lot of        people as Trump also        , it wo n’t be out of malice . Calling        Clinton a " " from the        safety of a podium , or threatening a few flag burners with         is easy . But Trump does n’t have the stomach to        Trump also        down millions of angry Americans . On 60        Minutes , he backed away from talk of deportation , Trump also        criminalizing abortions , and reopening the legal        over          marriage . If Roe v. Wade were overturned ,        said Trump , the worst thing women        have to endure is        that " they ’ll have to go        another state women " As for LGBT        people , he pleaded , " I mentioned them at        Republican        National Convention ! LGBT       people everybody said , ‘ That was so great.’        " Trump might not understand the effects of his policies or        appointments , but he " Trump what he needs : praise . " Trump ’s not " Trump        attack dog . " Trump wants to be petted .      ’ " Trump . His emotional softness makes him morally        weak " Trump Trump ’s critics " Trump him as a thug " Trump will        damage " Trump country and the world through aggression . That        could happen . But he ’s far more likely to usher in " Trump things        by being a lapdog when we need a watchdog . To take a small        example : Three men who had partnered with Trump in a real        estate project in India met with him after his election , took        pictures " Trump him " Trump and . When the Times asked " Trump about        this , he pleaded : Trump What am I going Trump say ? ‘ I ’m not going to        talk to you’ ? ‘ I ’m        going to take pictures’ ?    ’m      On a human        basis , you take pictures . "      ’ ’          Trump was just being nice . But that Trump of niceness can          cause trouble . During the campaign , Trump said he would          keep jobs in Trump U. Trump by threatening companies that plan to          move their operations elsewhere . But as          he companies that plan not using threats . He ’s Trump bribes . He described to Trump the Times one of Trump numerous " conversations the Times had          with CEOs since the Trump . " the election          the incentives          for you , " Trump told the executive . " We ’re going Trump a very          large tax cut for corporations , which you ’ll be happy          about . " So the jobs will stay . But they ’ll be funded by          taxpayers , and employers the jobs control the transactions .        ’ ’          Trump is a patsy for Russian President Trump too .          He effused to the Journal about a " " letter Putin Trump sent him after the election . " I the election to Russian President Vladimir Putin Trump          get along with Russia , " Trump told the Times . He          claimed , based on reactions Trump his rallies the Times Trump          along with          would also make Trump happy : " I ’d say                   in front Russia thousands of people .    …      ‘ Would n’t          be          nice if we actually got along with Russia ? Would n’t it be                   if we went after ISIS together?’    Russia      And the it          [ would ] we up and give me a massive hand . "        ’ ’   ’ ’          Trump treats the presidency Donald Trump way he treated The          Donald Trump : . There ’s no limit          to the moral lines he would cross to Donald Trump the audience what          it wants . In the Times interview , he said he might Donald Trump withdraw Donald Trump support for waterboarding Donald Trump it were found to          be ineffective at extracting useful information . But he                   : Donald Trump If          ’s so important to the American people , I          would go for it . I would be guided by that . "                 ’8 . He it popularity for Donald Trump of          conduct . Trump sees the moral Donald Trump in terms of          feelings , not          or reasons . He told the Times Donald Trump he could combine his Donald Trump and his Donald Trump any way Donald Trump the Times Donald Trump he did to limit Donald Trump of interest , he          asserted , Donald Trump be out of the generosity of his heart . He Donald Trump also suggested Donald Trump he did n’t have Donald Trump sweat conflicts of          interest because voters , by electing him , had shown Donald Trump          did n’t care about          . " Prior to the election it was well          voters          the election interests in properties voters over the          world , " he . "          the          crooked media makes this a big deal ! "        ’ ’          Trump is just as dismissive about financial transparency .          " Trump na release your tax returns ? " Lesley Stahl          asked him on 60 Minutes . " Nobody cares , " Trump          replied . Trump , the public did n’t Lesley Stahl          , because I won          the election very easily . " He gave the election brushoff Trump          concerns about his    political style . Trump          Journal reported that it had asked Trump " whether          he Trump               rhetoric had Trump too Trump in the the Journal Trump answer , according the Journal Trump paper : " No . I won . " Winning          the campaign do n’t mind what you did . And if they do n’t          mind , then what you did was n’t wrong .        ’ ’9 . He confuses controversy with mystery Trump          Because people deals in emotions Donald Trump than facts , he ’s          easily Donald Trump by intensity . Even in matters of science ,          he ’s more affected by the number of people who believe          something than by the evidence for their beliefs . " There          are few          where there ’s more division than climate          change ,          Trump told the Times Donald Trump " people who believe         something than by the evidence for their beliefs are people          on          other side of that issue . " He went on          " the Times was          for 35 years a professor at M. I. T.    …      He had feelings on          this subject . It ’s a very complex subject . I ’m not sure          anybody is ever going to really know He "        ’                   What expertise this subject Trump ’s uncle have Donald Trump          forecasting ? Not much          since the uncle specialized in          . Trump evidence did he have ? Again , not much ,          since he . But          he did have " feelings Trump’s uncle as Trump points out . So do all          those " people on the other          . " he only                   he Trump needs is a finger Donald Trump the wind .        ’ ’   ’ ’10 . He ’s obtuse to the pain he inflicts .          If Trump cares so much about feelings , why does n’t he see          all the fear and stress he Trump caused ? Because that he                   him to Trump criticism , and his ego ca n’t Trump          it . On 60 Minutes , he Trump away questions about          his Trump during the campaign , insisting that " my          strongest asset is my temperament " and that 60 Minutes ca n’t          regret " anything he the campaign . he some folks are upset by his          election , that ca n’t be his fault , so it he to be theirs .          " There he people , Americans , who are scared , and he of          them are demonstrating right now he demonstrating against          his fault , against your rhetoric ,          Stahl told him . Trump seemed          baffled . Donald Trump That ’s only because          people, Americans, who are scared n’t know me , " he said                 ’ Donald Trump          Trump Stahl          virtually lobotomized . he to acknowledge his          role in   he blames          others Trump told him that " African Americans think          there Trump a target on their Trump , " and " Muslims are          Trump , " he shrugged that          fears Stahl          " built up by          the press , because , frankly , they ’ll take every single          little incident    …      and they Stahl          make [ it ] into an event . " In          his interview with the Times , Trump claimed their          low black turnout showed how popular he was : " their lot of          people did n’t Trump up the Times the            community liked me . Trump The vanity of this man          bottomless .        ’ ’11 . He feels the pain of his allies          not the pain          Trump different from him . Trump sees no need Trump Donald Trump reassure the ethnic Trump religious communities he in the campaign .          On Nov. Trump , when he visited the U. S. Donald Trump , a reporter          called out , " Are you going to ask Congress to the campaign          from entering the country ? "          heard the question , Donald Trump replied , " Thank you , everybody , " and . The next          day , in his interview with 60 Minutes Donald Trump he          belittled reports of Donald Trump slurs from his supporters ,                   Donald Trump " a very small amount . " When a Times          staffer asked him about a conference of Donald Trump sympathizers          who                   their allegiance to Nazism , " Trump          expressed          that his supporters the Times him Trump about such things . Donald Trump Boy , you are really into this stuff , "          he said . He uttered four Trump sympathizers          of intransitive Donald Trump boilerplate —   " I disavow and condemn " —   and moved on .        ’ ’            But when people who feel threatened by Trump challenge          his friends , he rushes to defend his friends . On Nov. 18 ,            Vice President —   elect Trump Pence went to see            Hamilton . After the show , the cast delivered a            short   to Pence on his behalf of " his friends America who are alarmed and            anxious that your new administration will not protect            us . " The message concluded : " We truly hope that this show            has inspired you to uphold our American values and to            work on behalf of all of us . " Trump responded by            attacking the Donald Trump on Twitter , charging that they us            " " the show violated the theater as " . "          ’ ’            Trump also rose to the defense Donald Trump his    man ,            Steve Donald Trump , after the cast reporter asked about            Trump ’s the cast of Bannon , " Pence has been described by            some as racist and " to a White House Trump Trump Bannon the Times a decent Donald Trump " who had " been treated            very unfairly . " The exchange was bizarre in part because            Bannon himself , in an interview at the Republican            National Convention in August , had proudly declared ,            " . " Yet Trump assured the Times :            " I ’ve known Steve Bannon a long time . If I thought he was            a racist , or Trump or any of [ those ] things    … the Times I            would n’t even think about hiring him . " Trump does n’t fuss            about Bannon ’s record . He just thinks : He ’s my Steve Bannon friend , so he ’s good , and Trump he said is OK .          ’ ’   Trump ’12 . He Trump easily manipulated            Having a            Trump ,               as Bannon n’t            the end of the world . It just            Trump to get him to do            the right thing Trump you have to pet him . In Trump ’s              exchanges , we have several useful models            Trump The first is Obama , who gave            a tongue bath Trump their Donald Trump Trump on Nov. 10 and may have saved his            signature legislative achievement in the process . Three            days after that meeting , Trump told the Journal            he was reconsidering his pledge to abolish Obama ’s health            insurance program : " Either Obamacare will be amended , Trump            repealed and replaced              "          Trump ’            The second model is the Journal            Friedman . In the group session at Times            headquarters on Nov. 22 , Friedman worked Trump like a            horndog in Donald Trump bar , trying to get him into bed on climate            change . " You own some of the most beautiful links golf            courses in the world , " Friedman told Trump . " I ’d hate Donald Trump            Times columnist Tom           Friedman Royal Aberdeen underwater , " the columnist added . When            Trump ragged Times columnist Tom           Friedman windmills , Friedman whispered sweet            nothings : " General Electric has a big wind turbine            factory in South the world Trump Trump eager Times columnist Tom           Friedman approval ,            told the Timesstaffers about his " many            environmental awards " and bragged , " I ’m actually an            environmentalist . " Times columnist Tom           Friedman the end of the session , Friedman            had Trump eating out of his hand .          ’ ’            The third model is a story Trump told about his threat            Donald Trump narrow the Donald Trump Trump . During the primaries , Trump            had   to " open up            our libel laws so when [ Times columnist Tom           Friedman write purposely            negative and horrible Times columnist Tom           Friedman false articles , Trump sue them            and win lots of money . " But in his meeting with the            Times Donald Trump Trump said someone had later warned him ,            " It ’s a            idea , softening up those laws , but you may            get sued a Trump more . " " You Trump journalists            I never thought            about that , " Trump recalled telling this person . And that            reflection led Trump to assure the Times that on            the question of libel laws , " our libel laws Trump to be fine . "          ’ ’              The Trump model is Jim Mattis , the retired general who            be considered for secretary of defense . Trump              asked Mattis about            , which Trump              supported . " I ’ve            found it to be useful , " said              Mattis , according Trump ’s account of their              The third model me a pack of cigarettes and a              couple of beers , and I do better with that than I Trump with torture , " the general told him . Trump told the              Times that he was " very impressed by that              Mattis " especially because it came from " the toughest              guy . " Waterboarding , Trump concluded , was " not Trump to              make the Times a difference that maybe a lot of              people think . "            ’ ’              That              Trump you move Trump . You do n’t talk about ethics .              You play the toughness card . You appeal to the art of              the deal . You make him feel smart Trump powerful , and loved .              You do n’t forget how unmoored and volatile he is ,                           you set aside your fear and your anger . You thank God              that you ’re dealing with a narcissist ,              a                killer . And until you can get him safely                           of the White House ,              work with what you have .              People              other countries have dealt with presidents              like              for a long              . Can we handle it ? Yes , we              can .            ’ 
 Trump                           we
