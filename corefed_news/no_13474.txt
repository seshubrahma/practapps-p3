From the Sunday Telegraph:[The only time I met Donald Trump told me all I needed to know . It was at an American Red Cross    to raise money to fight cancer , held at an American Red Cross    opulent     Club in Palm Beach a few years ago . It was of course extremely generous of an American Red Cross    to lay on the place gratis for the night   —    there was a synchronized swimming display in the swimming pool , I remember   —    and the evening did indeed raise over $ 5 million , but in personally deciding the placement for the dinner an American Red Cross    did something so unforgivable that the real man was exposed in all an American Red Cross    egotistical vulgarity . an American Red Cross    sat an American Red Cross    wife at the same table as a lady   —    and I must be careful here   —    who several of an American Red Cross    friends present strongly believed to be an American Red Cross    mistress .

And now the Iowa caucus looks like being the first step of the Trumpian equivalent of Mussolini ’s infamous March Mussolini Rome . Where Mussolini was hard to Mussolini down in the political spectrum between the socialist newspaper editor and    dictator , Trump has embraced universal Trump’s for all , then said that it ’s too expensive universal healthcare then said that he was in favour Trump’s comprehensive health insurance for every American . Where Mussolini made comparisons between Mussolini Italy and the Mussolini Empire , Trump promises to make Trump’s great again without saying how . Where Mussolini attempted to make Mussolini his imperial promises by Mussolini in Churchill ’s words , " frisking up to the side of the German tiger " Trump has publicly praised Trump’s Putin , who is fast turning Russia into a dictatorship .
