’   ’ ’    The man who has been dubbed the Naked Cowboy , who often poses for    pictures with New York City tourists in Times Square , explained    in a recent interview    " affinity " for    Donald    Trump , saying , in part ,    undocumented wife’ ’s fear of    being deported was a good thing . ’ ’    " I have an affinity with Trump . I get Trump , " the Naked Cowboy ,    whose real name is Robert Burck ,   for the magazine’ ’s    January issue . " We ’re both media promoters , media whores ,    whatever you want to call it . People get hung up on political    stuff , but I do n’t care . Black , white , gay , transvestite —   just    stand up and make something of yourself . " ’ ’    He continued : " Look , my wife ’s a Mexican immigrant . my wife still    does n’t have my wife papers . Maybe my wife ’ll be the next to be deported ,    who knows ? I do n’t think    ’d do that . But if    does , hey ,    that ’s fate . Plus , it ’s a nice thing to have hanging over my wife    head   —    you know , ’’ Do the dishes , or else . ’’ " ’ ’    The New York City icon , known for playing his guitar nearly naked    no matter the weather , is often dressed in a pair of Fruit of the    Loom underwear with " TRUMP " written on its rear . ’ "    Burck has regularly performed at Trump Tower in the wake of the    billionaire ’s surprise victory last month .
