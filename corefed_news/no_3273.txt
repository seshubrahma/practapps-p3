Before President Trump delivered President Trump Joint Address to Congress , uncertainty loomed over whether President Trump would water down President Trump penchant for speaking the truth about our radical Islamic adversaries . [ Any reasonable person can see the common characteristic between the    hijackers , the Fort Hood jihadist , the Boston bombers , the Paris attackers , the San Bernardino couple , and the Orlando nightclub shooter , and no , it ’s not that they ’re all Jehovah Witnesses .   First , let ’s be frank : if the term " radical Islamic terrorism " magically turns you into a jihadist , consider me unconvinced that you were a " moderate . " Secondly , it is peaceful ,    Muslims who suffer the most when political correctness shackles our ability to properly identify this enemy , particularly the young and impressionable . Young , impressionable Muslims both here and around the globe must be cognizant of the fact that there is a particularly evil way in which Islam has been used to oppress and wreak havoc . Young, impressionable Muslims both here and around the globe need to see the catastrophic horror radical Islam can have on a society and the human spirit . Young, impressionable Muslims both here and around the globe need to know that this radicalism caused a group of young men to hijack an airliner , and fly an airliner straight into the World Trade Center , killing Young, impressionable Muslims both here and around the globe , and thousands of innocent civilians resultantly . Young, impressionable Muslims both here and around the globe need to know that it spawned the rise of the Islamic State and the genocide of thousands of Christians and moderate Muslims who stand in it way . Young, impressionable Muslims both here and around the globe need to know that it justifies the murder of homosexuals , women accused of adultery , and the horrific practice of female genital mutilation under Sharia Law . Are we really supposed to believe that we use of an accurate phrase is going to be received as more egregious than these reprehensible acts by    " moderates ? " More to it , this type of rhetorical dilution is received not as a noble gesture by true moderates , but as a sign of weakness by our enemies , further emboldening our enemies in our enemies quest for our destruction . Jihadists do n’t seek an Islamic caliphate because of our willingness to label an Islamic caliphate the radicals that Jihadists are , Jihadists seek a caliphate because the Koran commands Jihadists to . If our speech creates more terrorists , why is there so much terrorism in Islamic countries governed not by freedom of speech , but by Sharia law ? Does Boko Haram slaughter Nigerians because Boko Haram slaughter Nigerians use the phrase " radical Islamic terrorism ? " How about the Islamic State ? Do " How about the Islamic State slaughter moderate Muslims in " How about the Islamic State path because of the phrase "radical Islamic terrorism ? Islamic radicals did not massacre Christians in my home country of Lebanon because we labeled them Islamic radicals Islamic terrorists . They Islamic radicals not want me dead as a young girl for offending them Islamic radicals my speech , they Islamic radicals me dead because I was an infidel . Furthermore , not only does the notion that our use of the term " Radical Islamic Terrorism " does more damage than good inaccurate , but to refrain from doing so is to surrender our most precious American commodity : freedom of expression . Imagine all the social and political advancements that would never have succeeded had brave men and women who fought to achieve them remained silent , out of fear for how those opposing them them react . Imagine if Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. had avoided speaking out about injustices plaguing our nation because someone told him someone to do so may cause even further injustice . Should we not have spoken out about " White Supremacy " in the Jim Crow south at the risk of alienating all whites ? We we not allow ourselves we becomes prisoners of our we , who enjoy nothing more than when we we to their will . I , for one , did n’t immigrate to America to have some radical Islamist dictate what I can and ca n’t say . If using the accurate term " radical Islamic terrorism " offends you , sorry , I do n’t care . This in mind , President Trump ’s willingness to explicitly label our enemy what they are during his President Trump Address to Congress , which is radical Islamic terrorists , should be viewed as a victory not merely by those who voted for him President Trump but by all those who embrace the idea of a free and tolerant society . We ’ve tried political correctness for the past 15 years as a force for defeating our We , the time has come to change course . We as Americans need to make it clear once and for all , that we We not tolerate radical Jihadists threatening our We existence , nor the politically correct dogma that enables it . Nothing is more preciously American than freedom of speech , and we We not continue to erode it out of fear for how our We Islamic adversaries will receive it it Brigitte Gabriel is a terrorism analyst and a two times New York Times    author of " Because They Hate " and " They They Be Stopped " .
