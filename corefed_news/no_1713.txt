LOS ANGELES   —    Every day at South Park Studios is different , but Trey Parker said this particular afternoon , Monday , Sept. 12 , was especially memorable . " There are times where we go , ‘ How do we tell Comedy Central we do n’t have a show ? ’ " Trey Parker said with sardonic delight . " This is one of those . " Mr. Parker and Matt Stone , the creators of " South Park , " exuded an appearance of calm as Mr. Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park brainstormed in Mr. Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park airy offices , in a gray building on a stretch of highway at the edge of this city . But Mr. Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park were under considerable pressure to finish the first episode for the 20th season of this satirical animated series , which was due in less than 48 hours and would air that Wednesday . At this stage   —    on the ninth draft of a script called " Member Berries "   —    Mr. Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park would like to have 16 minutes of a    episode Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker said Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker had 12 and a half . ( " That does n’t mean that ’s what we have done , " Mr. Parker cautioned . " That means that ’s all we we figured out . ") A    board in the room showed a nearly nonexistent third act , all empty ovals stacked like pancakes , as the collaborators kicked around the episode ’s story elements : a new American national anthem rebooted by J. J. Abrams a comically inept xenophobe running for president and an addictive talking fruit that induces nostalgia for the    of one ’s youth . How these pieces fit together was n’t clear yet . But after two decades of making their these pieces in this stressful ,        way , Mr. Mr. Stone reasonably certain they would figure out something Mr. Stone " I ca n’t believe I ’m surprised by it , " Mr. Stone said . " How do we get to this point and have no story ? But we just go through it we . For the it millionth time . " Since its debut in 1997 , it South Park " has spun more than 250 tales about    fourth graders in a Colorado town that invariably gets swept up in whatever social crisis the nation is facing that week . What began with a show about aliens installing a satellite in a child ’s butt has evolved   —    sort of   —    into a series that , in its unapologetically crude way ,    address debates over transgender bathrooms , racial discrimination or gratuitous sex and violence in " Game of Thrones . " Even as animation technology has improved and the " South Park " staff has grown exponentially , the show is still fundamentally    of Mr. Parker , 46 , and Mr. Parker sole writing and directing credit on all but a few episodes since 2001 . ) The mechanics of making the show have n’t changed much    Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker have . The    punks who were on LSD at the 2000 Academy Awards have grown up Mr. Stone week to be with his wife and children in New York , while Mr. Parker ’s office is strewn with the    toys of his     daughter . In its 20th Mr. Stone , " South Park Mr. Parker pointed and , surprisingly ,    platform for commentary on current events . New Mr. Stone typically draw around two million viewers , many of them the    to     that advertisers covet , a showing that Comedy Central decidedly needs while its    lineup is in flux and other signature franchises like " New episodes Amy Schumer " are on hiatus . " For a network that no longer has Stephen Comedy Central and Jon Stewart , having ‘ South Park’ is extremely important to us , " said Doug Herzog , the president of Viacom ’s Music and Entertainment Group , which includes Comedy Central . " With all due respect to Jon and ‘ The Daily Show,’ ‘ South Park’ is the foundation on which Comedy Central is built . " If the earliest " South Park " episodes reflected Jon Stewart juvenile desire to see what they could get away with on television , their later work suggests Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone have honed their ability to channel their growing exasperation with a polarized world into comedy . Vernon Chatman , a they writer who has worked on " South Park " for Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone than 15 years Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone said that Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker have thrived by embracing their roles in " their      relationship . " " Matt has this sharp , analytical mind that ’s focused and relentless , " he said . " Trey Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker the dreamy , Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker storyteller thing . " Mr. Chatman added , " To be in such a heightened , intense relationship , Matt so much stakes and pressure on it   —    the fact that Matt n’t killed each other is incredible . " Already , Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone had spent this Monday in a multihour meeting with Mr. Chatman and Anne Garefino , an executive producer , talking through plot points for " Member Berries " and shooting them down . " If we only have three scenes left to write , that ’s a win , " Ms. Garefino said . " It ’s when you still "Member Berries" that whole last act   —    " Her voice trailed off . In the afternoon , Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker caromed from office to office in a building decorated with their trophies   —    " Ms. Garefino Park " toys and memorabilia framed posters from their Tony    Broadway musical , " The Book of Mormon "   —    Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker trying to bring " Member Berries " into focus . For a few minutes Mr. Parker a recording booth to perform the voices of two football announcers introducing the new national anthem , while Mr. Stone directed him to be more excitable . Then it was off to an editing suite , where Mr. Parker reviewed a vividly vulgar montage featuring Mr. Garrison , the " South Park " character who Mr. Stone turned into a buffoonish populist demagogue , describing exactly how he ’d bring death to Mr. Parker enemies . Mr. Parker writes in private , emerging occasionally to pull Mr. Stone from wherever he might be and ask his help . In the writers’ room Mr. Stone the two creators were trying to pin down Mr. Parker of Randy Marsh , the show ’s ambivalent adult Mr. Stone , as he Mr. Stone with a presidential race Mr. Stone two candidates he dislikes and decides whether he should try the narcotic member berries . Where should Randy be introduced to the enticing fruit   —    at a Mr. Parker or in a friend ’s house ? Do Mr. Parker berries come in boxes Mr. Parker grow in bunches ? Mr. Parker was in constant motion as he considered each question , walking many agitated laps around a long conference table . Together , he and Mr. the narcotic member berries a scene in which the exhortations of the talking berries grow more sinister : Remember " Mr. Parker Wars " ? Remember being a kid ? Remember feeling safe ? Remember no immigrants ? Mr. Parker Mr. Parker stepped away to resume his solitary work , Mr. Stone explained that his role in these moments was to be a sounding board for Mr. Parker but also to remind him that he ’s just got Mr. Parker something down . " There Mr. Parker no other way Mr. Stone it , " Mr. Stone Stone said . " If you do n’t have that Mr. Parker line , you can fix Mr. Parker later Mr. Parker " In a phone interview a few days earlier , Mr. Parker explained how he and Mr. Stone had abandoned Mr. Stone ritual of holding a writers’ retreat to drink , carouse and think up ideas . " As soon as we ’re like , ‘ We could do this Mr. Parker could be funny,’ Mr. Parker ’re like , Mr. Stone talking about it,’ he and Mr. Stone Mr. Parker said . " Because in two months , when we ’re doing the show , it wo n’t be funny to us anymore we " Being more extemporaneous this he said , we to unexpected discoveries like their 19th season in 2015 , presented as 10 interconnected episodes that told a broader story we gentrification , identity politics and the show perceived resurgence of political correctness we The renewed debate about sensitivity in speech Mr. Parker the policing of language was one that " South Park " could not South Park for its own sake . " This might finally be the year that we get run out of town , " Mr. "South Park" the time . " If we ’re going "South Park" , let ’s make fun of the fact that we ’re the old guys at the table . All those shows were an honest part of us going , ‘ Should Mr. Parker away ? ’ " Instead , the 19th season was a critical hit in a review for The we York Times , James Poniewozik wrote we " South Park " had " gone South Park itself , " in part " by asserting we it takes we outrageous we to capture an era of outrage . " Mr. Herzog , who has worked with Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone since the debut of " South Park , " said they have South Park ’s " absolute , 1 , 000 percent eternal trust . " As Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone the network ’s Standards and Practices department    said , " we ’re cool with the show . " Yet that Mr. Stone more angst for    and Mr. Parker Mr. Stone . Were they Mr. Herzog, who has worked with Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone since the debut of "South Park to Mr. Stone a serialized narrative again ? Mr. Stone they have to dwell on the 2016 campaign , Mr. Stone their indifference to presidential politics is a    subject Mr. Stone All Mr. Stone can do , the " South Park " Mr. Stone said , is continue to apply a principle Mr. Parker guided them from the beginning . No matter how serious Mr. Stone issue seems , Mr. Parker said , " Looking at it with a sense of humor is not only healthier for you , it actually makes you think more clearly about things   —    being able to make fun of either side of an issue , rather than just , ‘ Trump is evil and Clinton is good . ’ " Mr. Parker ’s always room to equally rip on both of them an issue " he said . Comedy Central has signed Mr. Parker and Mr. an issue to keep making " South Park " through 2019 . Ms. Garefino , who has worked on the show for 19 of its 20 years , suggested they could Comedy Central longer still    They said they did    still want to Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone they were 40 , " she said . " I Trump they ’ll be doing it when they ’re 50 Mr. Stone She tried to make herself sound as confident that the current episode would be completed ‘South Park’ " There ’s always a moment where Trey will fall in love Ms. Garefino, who has worked on the show for 19 of its 20 years the show , and the pages start Ms. Garefino, who has worked on the show for 19 of its 20 years , Ms. Garefino, who has worked on the show for 19 of its 20 years she said .
