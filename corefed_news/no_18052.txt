Members    of the the press    been very vocally complaining because only    one reporter , from the conservative Independent Journal Review ,    is traveling with Tillerson . ’ "    Some reporters , like MSNBC ’s Andrea Mitchell , have been    using commercial airlines to follow Tillerson ’s travels but    have    been traveling with him .    ’    And the Independent Journal Review reporter , Erin McPike ,    initially    not file stories ( or even tweet ) from the    trip . ( This course of action was reversed by IJR early Saturday    morning . McPike filed a spot story and started to tweet in     ) . ’ ’    Several Washington , DC , bureau chiefs from prominent news    organizations sent a letter to the State Department saying    they’’re " deeply concerned " about the whole arrangement . ’ ’’ "    The lack of access has led to some confusion about    Tillerson ’s status throughout the trip . " ’    The Korea Herald   Friday    that Tillerson didn’’t   Tillerson’s lunch or dinner gathering scheduled    with South Korea officials and that " the US side opted not to    have a meal together , citing the secretary ’s ’’ fatigue . ’’ " ’ ’    The story gathered steam when The Washington Post’ ’s Glenn    Kessler     it , writing Tillerson " cut short " his trip to South Korea .    Bloomberg foreign policy reporter Nicholas Wadhams     explaining Tillerson didn’’t cut his trip short his there was    never a dinner on the schedule . ’ "    In subsequent tweets , Wadhams     that Tillerson had n’t left Seoul yet , and that while the    traveling press , including Bloomberg , the Associated Press ,    Reuters , and NBC News , were not in a press pool , they were    the   traveling press, including Bloomberg, the Associated Press,   Reuters, and NBC News, were not in a press pool in the same hotel as Tillerson and staff . " ’    But there    been difficulties   —    Wadhams   the    traveling press " couldn’’t keep up " because Tillerson flew into an    air force base that morning . Since reporters aren’’t on his plane , aren’’t they’’ve had to book their own travel . ’ ’    " Up until now , secretaries of state have made it a key demand    that our press corps gets into meetings    …      that there be access    for the media , " MSNBC’ ’s Mitchell   recently   . " A key component of foreign policy    is being undercut by this . " ’ "    Moreover , the reporters who followed Tillerson to Asia    have n’t been allowed into some events .

" Tillerson heads to China next on his trip China ’ ’ Tillerson Despite the controversy over the trip , Scott Snyder his trip senior    fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations ,    cautioned against making any judgment on the success or failure    of the trip too soon . ’ his trip " I know there’ ’s a lot of swirl about all this and obviously the    difference in style between Tillerson and his predecessors has    brought a lot of attention ,      " but in terms of what he’ ’s accomplishing    it’ ’s a little bit too    to make a judgment . " ’ "    And Trump ’s tweet , which some viewed as a further escalation of    tensions , could even be a good thing for Tillerson . " ’    " Trump knows Tillerson is out there , " Snyder Tillerson .
