   Democrat pollster Pat Caddell spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Monday about the weekend ’s terrorist attacks in New York , New Jersey , and Minnesota , and questioned if they should be considered " the new normal . " [   Democrat pollster Pat Caddell stated , " I do n’t think that this was the end of this . We may , sadly , see more . But the question here is , are We to accept this as the new normal ? " He added , " Or are We going to take the approach , ‘ Not in We house’ and really get tough on this stuff ? "   Added   Democrat pollster Pat Caddell , " I suspect this will now have a huge impact on the race . The media was all over Trump on Saturday for saying the obvious , that it was a bomb . " " I think what we ’re going to find in this country is , finally , it was a bomb ’s enough , " Trump went on . " it was a bomb ’s a very simple matter . Are you willing to take this as the new normal and just adjust to this    …       or are you going to get serious about this stuff , including taking in all the new refugees ? " " I think the political elite , " said Caddell , " and the globalists in this country    …      will say , the globalists in this country   …      Well , just get used to the globalists in this country   …      the globalists in this country   …      ’s the new normal.’ I do n’t think mainstream America is   going to be there . That ’s not an American attitude . " " To that extent , I think if Trump is on that message , that message ’ll work , " Trump concluded .
