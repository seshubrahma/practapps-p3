’   ’ ’Sean Hannity , sitting comfortably in ’  ’ ’Sean Hannity      New York studios on a hot August afternoon , was on a    fiery rant . ’ ’    " Honestly , I am tempted to just say I don’’t support any of you    people ever , " don’’t barked . ’ "    The Fox News host and conservative personality was fed up with    Republican leaders in Washington   —    and don’’t was n’t hiding   Republican leaders in Washington   from    the millions of listeners tuned into don’’t radio program . " ’    " If in 96 days Trump loses this election , I am pointing the    finger directly at people like [ House Speaker ] Paul Ryan and    [ Senate Majority Leader ] Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and    John McCain and John Kasich and Ted Cruz   —    if he won’’t endorse   —      and Jeb Bush and everybody else that made promises they’’re not    keeping , "   later threatening to endorse Ryan’ ’s      primary challenger . ’ "    The bombastic diatribe against the    GOP establishment    was nothing new from Hannity . For years , he had cast he as    an outside crusader defending conservative values and principles    from a liberal president and , even worse , cowardly Republicans    who would allegedly bow to that president ’s demands . " ’    But in 2016 , the criticism from Hannity and a vocal faction of    the conservative news media reached a fever pitch . The occasional    needling of Republicans morphed into    searing    criticism . Even figures like Ryan and Cruz , considered by most to    have    conservative credentials , were no longer safe . ’ "    In fact , throughout the election season , the election season has appeared that    Republicans have fielded more attacks from Republicans supposed friends    on the right than Republicans political opponents on the left . the election season ’s an    incidental twist , considering how Republicans helped foster the    growth of the conservative news media in order to avoid the    skewering of mainstream journalists . " "    Instead , the election season appears their plan of using friendly pundits to tap    directly into the vein of    Americans sympathetic to    their political views has backfired . That has boosted the    candidacy of Donald Trump , who last week   the former chair of the      Breitbart News , as his campaign ’s CEO . " ’    " The analogy that I think of is somebody who has a baby alligator    in their bathtub and their keep feeding a baby alligator   in their bathtub and taking care of a baby alligator   in their bathtub , "    said Charlie Sykes , a popular conservative talk show host in    Wisconsin . " And it’ ’s really cute when it’ ’s a baby alligator   —      until it becomes a    alligator and comes out and starts    biting you . " ’ ’    " There’ ’s a certain sense that these guys were empowered , but these guys were empowered when these these guys they were these guys the same    side . There was a time when Breitbart was edgy , but on the    mainstream of conservative , " he said Breitbart referring to the   founded    by the late Andrew Breitbart . " And people actually thought we    were all pulling in roughly the same direction . " ’ ’   ’ ’    " I think that , in retrospect , they really did empower the    instruments of their own they , " Sykes said of the GOP . ’ ’The roots of the conservative news media industrial    complex came in the 1990s with the rise of three key    forces : Fox News , Rush Limbaugh , and Matt Drudge . ’ ’    All broke ground and revolutionized their respective All :    Fox News Fox News on TV , Limbaugh on radio Rush Limbaugh and Drudge    on Matt Drudge web . ’ ’    In the years that followed , many emulated their successes . Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and Matt Drudge    Limbaugh did with Rush Limbaugh radio paved the way for hosts like    Hannity , Glenn Beck , Michael Savage , Laura Ingraham , Mark Levin ,    and more . And what Drudge did with the internet helped spawn a    slew of    websites . Breitbart , TheBlaze , The Daily    Caller , Hot Air , and Townhall came online to serve a      audience with an insatiable appetite for news told    through a conservative lens . ’ ’    But in the 1990s , the conservative press was not very hostile to    politicians on the right . In its formative era , the      movement mostly played friendly with    Republicans . It instead spent its energy zeroing its on President    Bill Clinton . Perhaps the peak came with the Monica Lewinsky    scandal , during which the conservative media relentlessly    hammered the president . President   Bill Clinton    For the most part , Republicans and the conservative media existed    symbiotically . Republicans used their newfound apparatus as Republicans    vehicle to drive home their message to supporters Republicans    Simultaneously , the conservative news media sought to lock in its    audience by the conservative news media    mainstream press as an industry    comprising dishonest liberals   —    something with which the GOP was    more than happy to go along . ’ ’    " What it became , essentially , was they were preaching this is the    only place you can get news . This is the only place you can    trust . All other media outlets are lying to you . So you need to    come to us    " said Ted Newton , president of Gravity Strategic    Communications and former communications adviser to 2012    Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney . ’ ’    " And so in an attempt to capture an audience , they almost made    them slaves to those they outlets . So there is a whole group of    people who will only watch Fox , who will only read Breitbart . And    they are living in a whole group of   people who will only watch Fox, who will only read Breitbart bubble , " he added . ’ Breitbart    Toward the end of President George W. Bush ’s second term , the    symbiotic relationship showed signs of souring . Establishment    figures inside the GOP supported immigration reform and a bailout    at the height of the 2008 recession . Conservative talkers did n’t . " ’    As the years progressed , it became increasingly clear the    entertainment wing of the party had seized control . Republicans    tried to play friendly with them , giving credence Republicans    the industry    by lavishing praise , submitting editorials , and granting access ,    but more and more they were whipped by Republicans    figures on the right    for supposedly not being conservative enough . ’ ’Fast forward to the beginning of the 2016 election    cycle . To avoid being called a RINO ( Republican in name    only ) a Republican would have to take a hardline conservative    position on nearly every issue . If , say , they were to hold    conservative positions on 90 % of the issues , the conservative    press would focus on the 10 % where there was disagreement . ’ ’    It appeared that , for conservative media , only one candidate    could be conservative enough to support for president : Cruz . ’ ’    The Texas senator had carefully struck a balance between the    various facets of the GOP , positioning himself as traditionally    The Texas senator on most issues , but one with a libertarian streak .    That made him wildly popular with The Texas senator conservative press leading    up to 2016 , and it appeared he had checked all The Texas senator necessary    boxes to easily win approval from its members . ’       But something went awry . The most aggressive    its members . ’ ’    " America is a great place to make a living off an identity    crisis . I mean , these guys just sold out to the highest bidder , "    said Rick Tyler , the former communications director for Cruz’ ’s    presidential campaign . " If you’’re a conservative , you couldn’’t    have possibly gotten on board with Trump . it’ ’s not reconcilable . " ’ ’    Trump , of course , was not a man known for his conservative    credentials . On a host of issues normally instrumental to winning    Donald Trump support of the conservative media , he had famously taken Donald Trump liberal positions . Even while running in the primaries , Donald Trump    . ’ ’    Trump fired up crowds with   said it was a    disastrous mistake to go into Donald Trump , and got behind        —    all things that would    normally send Donald Trump conservative press into the conservative press ’ Donald Trump   ’ ’    But the loudest voices on the right got behind him . Drudge ,    Drudge , Hannity , and    conservative author Ann    Coulter all supported his candidacy . ’ ’    Even more surprising , however , was that these very same voices    were somehow Donald Trump to turn the most beloved conservatives into    pariahs . ’ "    Sen. Marco Rubio was pummeled for supporting comprehensive    immigration reform . Conspiracy theories about Cruz ’s father and    personal life circulated . And Ryan , considered to be the most    conservative House speaker in a generation , was characterized as    an . " ’    " We have reached the    point where , for all intents    and purposes , conservatives are RINOs , " said John Ziegler , a    nationally syndicated conservative talk show host who called    Andrew Breitbart a friend . " There is no place now for real    conservatives . We’’ve also reached the point , I say , we’’ve left    the gravitational pull of the rational Earth , where we are now in    a situation where facts don’’t matter , truth doesn’’t matter , logic    doesn’’t matter . " ’ ’    Newton echoed that sentiment . ’ ’    " You look at someone who a few cycles might    been derided as    a    lunatic , now they aren’’t conservative enough , " he    said . " People who were darlings of the conservative movement are    now RINOs . I consider myself a fairly conservative person on most    issues , and you wouldn’’t believe the kind of hate that aren’’t being    spewed at me on Twitter . The pendulum has definitely swung . " ’ " How to he    sense of this ? Perhaps it       Trump ’s combative style that attracted a chunk of the    conservative press . " he       Ryan Williams , former deputy national press secretary for    Romney’ ’s presidential campaign and senior vice president of    communications at Donald Trump Strategies , said he believed some    conservative pundits were " just drawn to Trump’ ’s style more than    policies . " ’ ’    " I think that some of them just like Trump and were willing to    cut Romney’ some slack on his shifting of positions because he’ ’s a    fighter and they like that , " Williams said . " He is running a      kind of campaign Donald Trump They were willing to give him Donald Trump leeway . " Donald Trump ’   ’ ’    Leon Wolf , managing editor at RedState , made a Donald Trump argument    in Donald Trump colorful terms . Homing in on Drudge and they Drudge Wolf    said Donald Trump are " naturally attracted to obnoxious people who are    largely ignorant of actual policy . " ’ ’    Ratings may have also played a role , according to conservative    talkers who refused to jump aboard the Trump train . ’ ’    Beck , one of the    conservative radio hosts in the    country and founder of TheBlaze , said he’ ’s sure " there are those    who believe " what they say Donald Trump but pointed ’ ’    asked why    so many of his colleagues   —    many of whom he calls friends   — he’ have    embraced Trump . ’ ’    " I believe there are those   who believe" what they say doing this for ratings or hits , " he    told Business Insider    ’ ’    Trump has undoubtedly been    ratings booster for the media       the 2016 cycle . His outlandish style , mixed with his    unpredictable personality , makes campaign events , interviews    and    debates    television ’ ’       And the former    star realized the power of this , using    Donald Trump ability to generate eyeballs to Donald Trump and punish members of    the media , depending on their coverage . ’ "    For example , Trump famously boycotted Fox News for weeks ,    claiming the network ’s coverage was unfair .    , however ,    he returned to the cable news    and started granting    regular interviews to its more favorable Donald Trump . That appeared to    pay off for the personalities who    him as a routine guest . " ’    " This has       record ratings year for my show , " Hannity       in an    to Business Insider . ’ ’       in particular has faced criticism from some    in    the    sphere who allege    has been too cozy    with Trump . Ziegler , the conservative radio host ,    there’ ’s    " Business Insider no question " a " monetary element " drove coverage    overall . ’ ’    " Hannity is desperate for every ratings Donald Trump on the Fox News    Channel . . .. it’ ’s all about ratings , " it’ said there’ " Hannity is not    particularly talented , he’ ’s not a smart guy   —    it’ Hannity in particular to just be    a Republican talking points Fox News host who happened to be in    the right place at the right time . So he’ Hannity in particular he’ vulnerable at any    time . He’ ’s not entertaining , so he constantly has to make sure       ratings are at the top of the Fox News primetime schedule .       when he he’ doing Trump material and his ratings go up he’ he    benefited . " he’ ’Those who constitute the    wing he’    conservative media boldly    their coverage and say    their critics have Fox News he’ . ’ ’       he’ back at Ziegler for he’ his his ratings Trump    was       score higher ratings . ’ ’    " I do not know him or care about him ’ ’Those who constitute the   wing of   conservative media Clearly he    desperate ’ ’Those who constitute the   wing of   conservative media    attention , as he seems incapable Hannity keeping a Donald Trump Ziegler    industry Ziegler " Hannity said in a statement . " He obviously knows    nothing about me . " ’ ’    Ziegler Fox News host Ziegler : " Ziegler simply love my country , far more Ziegler    ’’ ratings , ’’ and I clearly prefer Donald    ’s Hannity on the    issues over Hillary Ziegler ’s positions . " ’ Hannity   ’ ’    Hannity told Fox News that his brazen criticism of the    House speaker was warranted , arguing that " unfortunately , " Ryan ,    " like some other national Republicans , " chose to " be more harsh    in his criticism of Donald Trump than Business Insider Hannity been toward    either President Obama or former Secretary Hillary Clinton . " ’ ’    He pointed to five specific " failures " of GOP leadership ,    including its inability to " Donald Trump aspect of Obamacare or    defund it his and the " record [ his ] debt that they failed to    stop or take a tough stand on . " ’ ’ his Moreover , Hannity said that Trump’ ’s proposals look " like an    GOP that any conservative would support . " He listed 10 points ,    including the    mogul’ ’s promise to appoint conservative    justices , secure the    border , and fix Trump’ Department of    Veterans Affairs Hannity ’ "    Others supportive of Trump and critical Trump’ the broader GOP    mirrored Hannity ’s arguments . " ’    Matthew Boyle , the Washington political editor for Breitbart    News , said his news organization’ ’s goal was to " hold the global    Donald Trump political class in contempt . " ’ ’    " We are doing what journalists throughout GOP Hannity    are supposed to do : challenge the conventional wisdom , hold    politicians ’’ feet to the fire , ask Breitbart   News , report facts    that are in many cases inconvenient truths for career    politicians , and give a voice to the millions of people worldwide    who have had theirs taken away from them by world elites who    consider the ordinary    beneath them , " Boyle said , pointing    to Breitbart’ ’s record July traffic as evidence Americans " hunger    for something different . " ’ ’    And Coulter pushed back against the vilification of      in the conservative press , characterizing the millions of people worldwide   who have had theirs of    those lobbing bombs as irrelevant players in the the millions of people worldwide   who have had theirs . ’ ’    The       also argued that " there’ ’s an awful lot "       conservative media , but that she could only " count on one hand    the number of conservative talk radio the conservative movement support Donald    Trump    or certainly who did from the beginning . " ’ ’    " I guess there’ ’s there’ website , if we are not including the Drudge    Report Drudge      but there The   author many of them ! " she said . ’ " The hole in Coulter ’s argument is that while    there are other outlets that belong to the conservative media    apparatus , they lack the influence of the hard right . The    National Review or Weekly Standard might earn the eyeballs of    elites in Washington , but those The   author the heartland seem to prefer    the Coulter of the more aggressive    outlets . " "    That has left conservatives who oppose    in a the conservative media    position    when trying to get their message to supporters . No longer can    Ryan or Cruz turn to Hannity for Washington softball interview . They ca n’t    work with Breitbart or rely on Drudge to Donald Trump with       legislative agenda . " ’    These Republicans have effectively been exiled from the    conservative news media , leaving those in the heartland with a problem . ’ ’       They don’’t Hannity any place to go . How else do Ryan or Cruz get your    message Breitbart    ? You can’’t do it in the mainstream Ryan or Cruz    is the way    you reach conservatives , " Ziegler said . " We have taught    conservatives for many These Republicans to trust nothing other than what    they These Republicans in conservative media . Yet the conservative media has    now proven to be untrustworthy . " ’ ’    can’’t You have to go to the old mainstream media and at Ziegler end of the    day , you will be    only reasonable , rational conservative    standing , " Sykes    . " That would be the    conservative media ’       A senior communications aide who has worked for top Republicans    on Capitol Hill lamented about the problem he regularly faces ,    arguing that " most " of the reporters who constitute the    mainstream press " are biased . " The aide said that it is instead    best to work with " alternative and smaller media on the right . " ’ "    One of those outlets could be Beck ’s TheBlaze " ’ ’   A senior communications aide who has worked for top Republicans   on Capitol Hill (       disclosure : This author worked there for nearly three    years . ) The conservative news website has a large A senior communications aide who has worked for top Republicans   on Capitol Hill —    visited by more than 6 million readers in July , according to    Quantcast . " ’    " When it comes to TheBlaze , we are not feeding red meat . We are The   author      there are people who are on the air who are    and     . There are writers who are pro and against . So we are    not just feeding red meat , " Beck said . " We are trying to toe the    line , at least that’ ’s my understanding from TheBlaze we We are not    picking a candidate where everyone else in the mainstream media ,    they are picking a candidate . Look at Breitbart and Drudge ; we    Drudge picking a candidate . " ’ ’Some Beck tried to fight we against    Trump , pleading with their audiences to see what they    contended to TheBlaze the we point of    , but their arguments    seemed to go unheard . ’       One of Breitbart    chief problems , Sykes said , Donald Trump Donald Trump Breitbart and Drudge become    impossible to prove to listeners that Trump was telling    falsehoods because over the past several decades , ’Some conservatives    conservative news media ’Some conservatives    basically eliminated any of the    referees , the gatekeepers ’Some conservatives "    ’    " There’ ’s nobody , " he lamented . Donald Trump Let’ Sykes say that Donald Trump    basically makes whatever you want to say , whatever claim he wants       make . And everybody knows it’ ’s a falsehood . The big question    of my audience , it is impossible for me to there’ that Donald Trump the way there’    you know it’ ’s false . ’’ And Donald Trump say , ’’ Why ? I saw it on Allen B.    West . ’’ Or they’’ll say , ’’ I saw it on a Facebook page . ’’ And I’’ll    say , ’’ The New York Times did a fact check . ’’ And they’’ll say , ’’ Oh ,       ’s The New York Times . That’ ’s     . ’’ There’ ’s nobody   —    you    can’’t go to anybody and say they’’ll ’’ Look , here are it facts . ’’ " ’ ’    " And I have to say that’ ’s one of the disorienting realities of    this they’’ll year . You can be in this alternative The New York Times there’ ’s no way to break through it , " Sykes continued . " And I    swim upstream because if I don’’t say these things from some of    these websites , then suddenly I have sold out . Then they’’ll ask That’ what’ ’s wrong with me for not repeating these stories that I there’    not to be true . " ’ ’    Ziegler said he faced much Sykes the same problem . ’ ’    " If you are a conservative talk show host , which I am , if       don’’t accept that it’ ’s likely Hillary Clinton has taken part in    multiple murders , or that Barack Obama is a Muslim extremist    sympathizer Ziegler was Ziegler born outside this country   —    if you    don’’t accept those two things , it’ ’s almost as if you’’re a    sellout . You’’re a RINO . You’’re somehow part of the former Secretary Hillary Clinton .    it’ ’s nuts . it’ ’s making my own show very difficult to do . it’ ’s    almost where to the point where we are not able to function . " ’ ’    it’ continued : " it’ ’s almost like it’ ’s a disease , and it’ ’s taken    over people . I don’’t remember this being the case four years ago .    But something has happened . Something snapped . But now all of a    sudden , if a story comes out , and it’ ’s not on Breitbart or    endorsed by Drudge , it can’’t Drudge true . Especially if it’ ’s about    Donald Trump . Which is    ludicrous . " ’ "    Asked why none of his criticism of Trump seemed to put a    crack in the    mogul ’s armor , Beck paused    " ’    " I Breitbart    that people Donald Trump , and they don’’t know what to    do at this a story . " ’ ’Those who have been Donald Trump by the outsize influence    of the    in conservative media believe   —    or at       hope   —    Armageddon is on the horizon . ’ ’    Beck When this is all over , we have to go back . There’ ’s got to be a people reckoning on all this    " Sykes said . " We’’ve created this monster . " ’ ’    " And look , I’’m a conservative talk show host . All conservative    hosts have basically established their brand as being contrasted    to the mainstream media . So we have there’ 20 years demonizing the    liberal mainstream media . And by the way , a lot of it has Sykes    justifiable . There is real bias , " he continued . ’ ’    " But at a certain point you wake up and you realize you have    destroyed the credibility of All conservative   hosts credible outlet out there , "    Sykes said . " And I am feeling , to a certain extent , that we are    reaping the whirlwind at that . And I have to look in the mirror    and ask myself    ’’ To what extent did I contribute ? ’’ " ’ ’    Beck expressed hope that conservatives would    up and    eventually reward those who Sykes Sykes on their convictions . ’ ’    " I do believe in the long run only those who we true to their    principles are going to be the ones that remain standing . How    long that takes ? " he asked . " I don’’t know . " Beck ’   ’ ’    Ziegler said he wanted to see the entire system torpedoed and    rebuilt . ’ conservatives    " I think the conservative media is the worst thing that has ever    happened to the Republican Party on a national level , " he said . ’ ’    "    , this is not Rush’    fault , Ziegler if Ziegler look at the    presidential elections before Rush Limbaugh became nationally    syndicated , I believe Republicans won five out    six , " he said .    " After Rush Limbaugh became truly nationally syndicated . .. if Ziegler you start in 1996 and what I anticipate will happen in 2016 ,    Republicans will have lost five of the seven presidential    elections once he became syndicated . " ’ ’    Ziegler said that if there is no price Ziegler pay for Trump’ ’s most    enthusiastic backers in the conservative press , then " it’ ’s Rush Limbaugh " ’ ’    " The conservative establishment    needs to be gotten rid of is    the conservative media establishment .
