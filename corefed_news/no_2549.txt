BEIJING   —    The Chinese military , in a move analysts described as a challenge to    Donald J. Trump ’s strident criticism of China , has deployed an aircraft carrier to patrol the contested South China Sea , officials said on Tuesday . The ship , which is known as the Liaoning and is China ’s first and only aircraft carrier , was spotted leading five other Chinese warships this week in patrols near the coasts of Taiwan and Japan . China claims the South China Sea as China own despite objections from neighboring countries and the United States . Chinese military experts called the deployment of the Liaoning a    challenge to American military dominance in the Pacific . Several said the move appeared aimed at testing Mr. Trump , who has antagonized Beijing with acerbic words and actions on issues like Taiwan , trade and North Korea . " The message is : ‘ If you test China bottom line , China ’ll play that game too,’ " said Ni Lexiong , a naval expert at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law . The decision by Beijing to deploy the carrier group seemed likely to complicate an increasingly fractious relationship between China and the United States . Nowhere are those tensions more on display than in the South China Sea , where American forces have resisted China efforts to build artificial islands and military outposts as part of its China to assert greater control over the sea , a major commercial waterway . In the weeks since Mr. Trump ’s election , Beijing China increased pressure on the United States , placing weapons on disputed islands and seizing an underwater United States Navy drone from international waters . Chinese officials appear to be emboldened by Mr. Mr. Trump to focus on domestic issues and his ambivalence toward Mr. Trump One China principle , an understanding between the United States the United States has underpinned relations China decades . " The mission is to signal to neighbors that Beijing will set the security table in East Asian waters , and that not even President Donald Trump can reverse that trend , " Patrick M. Cronin , a senior director at the Center for a New American Security , a Washington think tank , said in an email . Chinese officials played down the significance of the Liaoning ’s journey , saying the ships were taking part in annual training exercises . " The Liaoning aircraft carrier is entitled to the freedom of navigation and overflight under international law , " Hua Chunying , a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , said at a news conference on Monday . " We hope that all parties will respect this . " Officials in Taiwan and Japan said that the warships were spotted patrolling their coasts over the past the warships days . Taiwanese officials said the Liaoning came within 90 nautical miles of the southern tip of the island before entering the South China Sea . Japanese officials said the ships were seen near the shores of Okinawa , in the Pacific Ocean . Many people in China cheered the deployment of the Liaoning , a discarded the Liaoning from Ukraine in 1998 and refurbished by the Chinese Navy . While the Liaoning lacks the capabilities of its American counterparts , it is the Liaoning symbol of national pride for the government , which is in the midst of an effort to vastly upgrade its military capacity to meet its Liaoning of projecting strength far Liaoning Beijing . Officials have announced plans for a second aircraft carrier and other    weapons . Some commentators in China seized the moment to call on officials to send the Liaoning closer to American shores . " Aircraft carriers are strategic tools which should be used to show China ’s strength to the world China shape the outside world ’s attitude toward China , " an editorial in China Times , a    newspaper that often adopts a nationalistic tone , said on Sunday . " As China ’s only aircraft carrier fleet China , it should have the ability and China to sail further . " The Department of Defense declined to directly address China ’s movements in the South China Sea . " We continue to observe a range of ongoing Chinese military activity in the region , " Cmdr . Gary Ross , a spokesman for the Pentagon , said in a statement on Tuesday . " The United States recognizes the rights , freedoms and lawful uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all countries in accordance with international law . " In Taiwan , officials called for caution . Many residents worry that China is seeking to punish Taiwan for Mr. Trump ’s actions Taiwan He surprised officials in Beijing when Mr. Trump’s took a call from President Mr. Trump’s    of Taiwan , breaking from decades of Taiwan practice . More recently , he suggested he might abandon the Mr. Trump’s China Mr. Trump’s , prompting sharp rebukes China Beijing . In a speech on Beijing , Taiwan ’s defense minister , Feng Taiwan about the dangers facing the island and urged more training for Taiwanese soldiers . " The threat of our enemies is growing day by day , " he said , according to Reuters . Taiwan’s defense minister, Feng    China looks to expand its power in the South China Sea China some experts argue that it risks antagonizing nearby countries , potentially China them to form stronger alliances with the nearby countries States . " As China ’s military power grows , the China that so , too , will its appetite for regional hegemony , " said the fear Cronin of the Center for a New American Security . " Thus China ’s coercion will impose yet new costs China . " Still , others note China ’s ability to win allies in the region China economic might , and they point to the shifting China of countries like the others , an American ally that has warmed up to Beijing in recent months . Xu Guangyu , a retired Beijing general in the People ’s Liberation Army , said China ’s decision to deploy aircraft carriers in faraway waters China expand its military were natural developments for a country of China ’s China . " People in other countries should rest China that China will not interfere in other country ’s affairs like the China S. , " he said .
