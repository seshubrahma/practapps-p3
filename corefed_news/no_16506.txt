  ( CNN ) I ’m tired of hearing about a big , beautiful wall and who should pay for hearing about a big, beautiful wall . And I ’m weary of hearing politicians try to gain votes on the backs of immigrants , both legal and undocumented , by calling one another bigots . As a white guy who served two terms as Governor of New Mexico , a border state with by far the largest percentage of Latino residents in the nation , I really wish the nativists and panderers alike would just take a break , admit what the real problems are , and let common sense prevail . There ’s a reason why Donald Trump is now fumbling Donald Trump way toward the " middle " on immigration policy , after having gained the Republican nomination on nativist promises to build a wall along our Mexico border and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants . Rounding up more than 11 million people     a population larger than all but the 7 largest states in the union     is a ludicrous notion to begin with . Everyone knows it , including Donald Trump . it was a lie cloaked in a promise . Even if it were possible , the idea of federal authorities rounding up millions of people and loading millions of people on buses is an image America could never stomach . Americans know better . Americans know that the only realistic and , to borrow from this week ’s language from Donald Trump , humane policy is to find a fair and safe way to allow    undocumented immigrants to get right with the law and go about their undocumented immigrants , paying taxes , having a valid Social Security number , and earning a legal status .    No cutting the line . No " special " path to citizenship . Just a common sense way for undocumented immigrants with jobs , families , and a clean record to come forward and live by the same rules as the rest of us . Polls show that even a majority of Republicans , the same folks who nominated Donald Trump , favor such a common sense , American approach . Let ’s not forget why we us to have more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the first place . The    would have you believe 11 million people swam the Rio Grande , burrowed under a fence or otherwise sneaked into our us in the dead of night . Yes , some of them did . But a significant number of undocumented immigrants actually came here legally     and stayed .   Many did n’t come —   and nor do they a significant number of undocumented immigrants nefarious reasons , but because they a significant number of undocumented immigrants work , established relationships or joined family members . They a significant number of undocumented immigrants n’t stay legally due to     restrictions on their a significant number of undocumented immigrants . They a significant number of undocumented immigrants students who graduated or found jobs , seasonal workers who found    work , or children brought here by their a significant number of undocumented immigrants . Of those who did hike the mountains of Arizona or stow away in a container ship , how many of them those who did hike the mountains of Arizona or stow away in a container ship have rather come here legally if the line to enter was actually moving ? Almost all of them those who did hike the mountains of Arizona or stow away in a container ship   But our politicians , both right and left , have created a system for legal immigration that simply does n’t work . We have artificial quotas . We have " caps " on certain categories of workers that have no real relationship to the realities of the free market . It ’s no coincidence that recent history shows the only successful way to reduce illegal immigration is to have a recession . Over the past 10 years , both illegal entries and the number of undocumented immigrants in the country have declined . That ’s not because the government did anything right . Even for those from the right countries or with the right skills , our bureaucracy makes it ridiculously slow and cumbersome to come here legally . If it it months or years to get a driver ’s license , how many of us would throw up our us , get behind the wheel , and take our us driving without one ? You know who you are . The way to stop illegal entry is to spend our resources making legal entry efficient for people coming here for the right reasons . Instead , our politicians want to spend those resources building walls , militarizing the border and " stepping up enforcement . "   Did they our politicians stop to think we us enforcing the wrong things against the wrong people ? Try this , instead : No caps . No categories . No quotas . Just a straightforward background check , the proper paperwork to obtain a real Social Security number and work legally or prove legitimate family ties , and a reliable system to know who is coming and who is going . Border enforcement will become what it should be : Keeping out real criminals ,    terrorists and others sneaking across the border for the wrong reasons . Stop sending drones out to keep a mother from crossing over with her a mother to join their drones , and focus on stopping the actual bad guys     or finding them drones they drones by . That ’s what will make us safer .    We us are a nation of immigrants , and we us become the greatest nation on earth without big walls and nativism . Yes , borders must mean something . Sovereignty and civilization depend on them Sovereignty and civilization But before we turn El Paso into a replica of Cold War Berlin or contemplate loading families on deportation buses , let ’s we a breath , recognize the real problem     a   flawed system     and fix it the real problem    a  flawed system
