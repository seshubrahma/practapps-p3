MSNBC Political Analyst Joan Walsh argued that while GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump is taking from the " toxic bog of    hate " by referencing the sexual assault allegations against Bill Clinton , " the Bill Clinton campaign is somewhat worried about the Clinton campaign " and the Clinton campaign " could hurt " Hillary on Thursday ’s broadcast of MSNBC ’s " The Last Word . "   Walsh said , " I think the Clinton campaign will eventually peter out , but I think that the Clinton campaign is somewhat worried about it . the Clinton campaign I have to say , the smooth move of the day on Instagram , was that her campaign Hillary Throwback Thursday photo , a wedding photo of Bill and Hillary looking very much in love . So , that to me was a kind of stick in your eye . But you know , I think they ’re trying Bill and Hillary play against   —    this   —    one of these things started with Hillary Clinton saying Hillary believe rape victims .    …      And she was then assaulted Hillary Republicans and others . Donald Trump has now taken this out of the kind of toxic bog of    hate , where all of these allegations , they never died . these allegations think it was we 20 years ago . I ’m feeling a lot younger this week , I do n’t know about you , Lawrence , Lawrence we ’re back in we ’90s . Which   —    I loved the ’90s , but the ’90s dangerous , because the ’90s was n’t litigated for the ’90s and    who do n’t necessarily    it , and are hearing some of this for the first time . So , it   —    this it hurt her . It ’s kind of like this ’s doing with Lawrence Republican presidential candidate Sen. ] Ted Cruz ( ) he ’s creating this weird Ted Cruz —    he ’s a gremlin , Ted Cruz creating this weird world of doubt , and forcing people to respond to things they would really rather not people about right now .
