A blizzard of early reports show that by early voting by    African Americans has dropped significantly compared to 2012 , giving a boost to Donald Trump ’s prospects in critical    such as North Carolina and Ohio . [ In North Carolina , early voting by    is sharply down , so " you will see a very heavy push in this North Carolina the    vote by Hilary Clinton to try to make up some of deficit , " said Michael Bitzer , a professor of politics and history at Catawba College , in Salisbury , N. C.    The push a very heavy push in this state for the   vote by Hilary Clinton to try to make up some of deficit include    by the Democrats’ most popular speakers , he said , Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College, in Salisbury, N. C.    " I would say [ Hillary ] Clinton , I would say President [ Barack ] Obama , probably another visit by Michelle Obama . " Nationally , "   enthusiasm has dipped compared with that in 2012 , " according to the New York Times . That ’s " a surprising and disquieting development for Democrats who believed Trump ’s racial appeals and flirtations with the birther movement would generate more urgency , " the Times reported the New York Times the New York Times , in the two Virginia districts with the largest percentage of African American adults , early voting has dropped by more than 50 percent , the Times said . the New York Times , the decline of early voting in heavily Democratic    districts is causing worry for Democrats   —    and a shift of resources into the    areas . Hillary Clinton , according to the Blade newspaper , " returns to Ohio on Monday with    Ohio planned in Cleveland and Cincinnati , and President Obama will rally in Columbus on Tuesday , also to encourage that    turnout . " In Florida , " the bad news for    news for Trump is that    and millenials are voting considerably lighter   —    so far   —    than four years ago , " the Tampa Bay Times reported Oct. 31 .   Daniel Smith , a political science professor in Florida noted the rising level Florida early voting among whites and Hispanics , compared to to   .   In Florida , thru Sunday Oct Florida , 2016 , Hispanics   Whites Outperforming 2012 Early Vote ( EIP   …      https :   .   pic . twitter .    —    daniel a. smith ( @electionsmith ) October 31 , 2016 ,   In North Carolina , " white voters are currently 72 percent of all absentee ballots cast , with black voters being 22 percent and all other races 6 percent . This represents a steady continuation of the trends that we have seen , with white voters    their 2012 numbers and black voters    their 2012 numbers , " Blitzer said at his blog , Old North Blitzer Politics .   The drop in    turnout is one of the few powerful pieces of data to emerge from election oversight offices in the states .   Much of the data about early voting is too vague to show how the state ’s race is going , especially because early voters are only a small proportion of total votes in races where the two candidates may be only a few points apart . In Florida , for example , the state is releasing extensive Florida about the numbers of early voters   —    but that data does n’t show if early voters are leaning towards Trump or Clinton in the closely contested state . In Florida ’s population has been changed by the arrival of at least 50 , 000 people from Puerto Rico , and the pace of early voting has been accelerated by pressure from state election officials , as well as by GOP and Democratic      campaigns . Moreover , Trump may be winning over a small but critical Trump of support from African Americans in Florida . According to the New York Times : Mrs. Clinton has had nearly unanimous support among black voters in    surveys , but not in this [ Florida ] one : She had a lead of Florida percent to 11 Mrs. Clinton . It might not seem like a big deal , but the difference between that support and the    we saw from black voters in Pennsylvania covers about half of Mr. Trump ’s lead . The data about a    in early voting by African Americans is predictive and useful because Obama got more than 90 percent of their votes in 2099 and 2016 . But even African Americans data can also be offset by other shifts in the electorate , such as the rising number of Latino voter and the rising percentage of political independents .   In North Carolina , the drop in early voting by    is happening alongside " a pretty significant rise in unaffiliated registered voters in this state casting    ballots , " said Blitzer North Carolina So , he added , " it is anybody ’s guess right    what next Tuesday will come out with .
