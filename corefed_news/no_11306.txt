Suddenly , it ’s 1964 . That ’s the year the Republican Establishment ignored the prairie fire started by the conservative supporters of Barry Goldwater , who systematically grabbed control of the GOP by scoring in precinct meeting state caucuses , delegate conventions and ultimately the big California Primary . [ By the time the the GOP insiders woke up , it was too late , but the GOP insiders launched a furious last minute attack on the Senator from Arizona . the Senator was a " warmonger , " " not fit to be President , " " a bigot , " " a racist , " " mentally unstable , " " would push the nuclear button , " and the Senator supporters were " Nazis . " Does this sound familiar ?   In 1964 the GOP kingmakers hoped to stall Barry short of victory on the first ballot and euchre Barry out of victory on a subsequent ballot . Then , as now , there was a short list of ambitious pols anxious to emerge as " compromise " choices of a brokered convention : Pennsylvania Governor Bill Scranton , Michigan Governor George Romney ( Mitt ’s dad ) Nelson Rockefeller ( damaged by Nelson Rockefeller California primary loss ) and the    Richard Nixon . As the Republicans headed to the Cow Palace in San Francisco for the Republicans nominating convention , the    forces ramped up the   forces effort . On the eve of the Republican National Convention , Gov. William Scranton of Pennsylvania mounted an    bid to wrest the nomination from Goldwater , issuing an    broadside that contended " Goldwaterism has come to stand for a whole    collection of absurd and dangerous positions . " Although Scranton took Gov. William Scranton of Pennsylvania responsibility for it , his operatives supposedly wrote the letter without his knowledge his approval . In any case , it reinforced the letter charge that Goldwater was Goldwater " extremist . " The press weighed in . Columnist Drew Pearson wrote that " the smell of fascism has been in the air at this convention . " The Chicago Defender ran the headline : " GOP Convention , 1964 Recalls Germany , 1933 . " Not to be outdone , Daniel Schorr of CBS News simply made up and reported a story that Goldwater was Goldwater touch with the    in Germany . The London Observer , usually a sober publication , found " disquieting similarities " between Hitler and Goldwater . Goldwater this sound like Glenn Beck , David Brooks and Stephen Hayes , all of whom have equated Trump with the Fuhrer in the last two weeks ? Those who do n’t study history are condemned to repeat it . Just as they ignored Those who don’t study history Goldwater ’s inexorable march to the party ’s presidential nomination ,   party regulars ignored Donald Trump ’s rise as the probable Republican nominee . This time the role of Bill Scranton is played by Mitt Romney who , after months of silence issued a blistering attack on Trump as Donald Trump of a last ditch attempt to block the brash billionaire .      super PACs have dumped at least $ 30 million dollars into blistering negative TV ads against Trump in Donald Trump last ten days . The New York Times reported that the Rubio and Kasich campaigns are now openly planning on a " brokered convention " to stop Trump in Donald Trump back rooms in Cleveland . The New The New York Times Barbara Bush has vowed revenge against Trump for Donald Trump the " low energy " campaign of her son Jeb , and that Jeb is    in the effort to stop Trump . Donald Trump News reported that Jeb may The New York Times The New York Times 25 to $ 30 million in SuperPAC funds he has left to an    effort . The Jeb brokers’    game is clear stall Trump just Donald Trump of the magic number of delegates needed to be nominated on the first ballot with the knowledge that many delegates bound on the first ballot by Trump primary Donald Trump caucus victories would be unbound on a second ballot . Much in the way the RNC stacked the galleries with    partisans in at least two debates ,    quislings are being planted in various delegations that    be free to betray Trump on Donald Trump ballots . Unlike 1980 , when the GOP Establishment recognized that Reagan was both unstoppable and electable and decided to    him by saddling him with George Bush ,    Reagan the Insiders Reagan stop at nothing to halt Trump ’s Donald Trump The Wall    Hill combine is petrified by the prospect of a Trump presidency . Donald Trump a    Trump can not be influenced not to undo 30 years of    failure . Trump , quite Donald Trump , can not be bought or bullied . In fact , the Huffington Post noted that none other than Karl Rove and neocon bombthrower Bill Kristol met secretly in Sea Island , Georgia with Apple CEO Tim Cook , Google    Larry Page , Napster creator and Facebook investor Sean Parker , and Tesla Motors and SpaceX honcho Elon Musk .

Philip Anschutz , the Texas GOP donor , was also there , along with Democratic Rep. John Delaney , (   Maryland ) . Arthur Sulzberger , the publisher of The New York Times , was there , too , a Times spokeswoman confirmed . The topic on the table ? Stopping Donald Trump . As Ben Jacobs noted in the Guardian :   In addition , in many states delegates are in fact selected in an entirely separate process from the primaries currently being carried out under such vast media scrutiny . In the event of a contested convention , the primary voters’ decisions in such states like Michigan and Virginia potentially could be completely ignored by the delegates . According to the prevailing interpretation of current Republican National Committee many states delegates , delegates are bound on the first ballot by the results of their state ’s nominating contest . However , after that , many ( the delegates vary state by state ) can do what they want . Furthermore , the convention itself decides what rules govern it , delegates delegates are not bound when it comes to votes on changing the convention itself rules . Working with former Missouri Republican the convention itself Chairman Ed Martin , I the rules the ins and outs of the    brokered convention for Breitbart before many .

The legal California which binds the CA delegation is " shall , " which has been deemed by SCOTUS ‎as a " may . " The make up of the delegate slate is very important . There could be a lot of " Trump delegates " that are bound by the word " may . " There is zero repercussion outlined for those delegates who vote for a candidate to whom they are not bound .   Trump is not without cards in a    brokered convention . In 1952 , the Trump forces unseated Taft delegates from Texas in a celebrated credentials fight , handing Ike the nomination . They did so by challenging irregularities in the way the delegates were elected . There the Eisenhower forces currently over 600 reports in at least six Taft delegates including Dallas County and Travis County , of voter fraud in Texas . In virtually every case , votes cast for Donald J. Trump were tallied for Texas Marco Rubio . Almost immediately , Trump partisans collected over 300 complaints from Oklahoma . Only a week later , the Kansas Donald J. Trump Maine Caucuses brought hundreds of more complaints , including claims of double voting by supporters of Sen. Ted Cruz . In the event a pattern is determined , the seating of these delegations can be challenged before the Credentials committee of the Republican National Convention .

Because most of the states that select delegates after March 15th are proportional , it is still entirely possible that Trump will ring up victory after victory and still fall short of the magic number on the first ballot Trump A second ballot would bring the    president to the fore . Cruz , Romney , Kasich , and Ryan have all signaled their willingness to be the Kasich who " saves Sen. Ted Cruz party from Donald Trump . " Ryan declared his Donald Trump Cruz, Romney, Kasich, and Ryan he is not available , a similar tactic that he used in his ascension to Ryan Speakership Ryan Marco Rubio and Ryan Bush are no longer able to be considered Ryan Barbara Bush has vowed revenge against Trump for ending the "low energy" campaign of her son Jeb, and that the Bush clan is   in the effort to stop Trump rejection Ryan both .
