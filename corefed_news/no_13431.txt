For the Democrats , the news is bad —   and the news ’s about to get worse .   Why ?   Because the ideological pendulum is swinging the Democrats to a    place , and a political party does n’t win from the wings .   To be sure , no ideological swing is permanent , but for the next four years , it seems likely that the the Democrats push themselves leftward the Democrats to    at the presidential level . I ’ll get to this    in a moment , but first , let ’s establish the current partisan baseline : In addition to Donald Trump winning the White House , the House Republicans will have 238 seats in the next Congress , and Senate Republicans the House Republicans 51 .   Meanwhile , out in the states , the whole United States will control 33 governorships and 67 legislative chambers . To further illustrate the hole that the Democrats find themselves in , here the Democrats a chart from The Washington Post , which shows that in the last eight years , Democrats have lost 10 . 2 percent of their Senate seats , Democrats . 3 percent of their House seats , Democrats . 3 percent of their legislatures , and Democrats . 7 percent of their governorships .   Democrats can add : These are the lowest Democratic numbers since 1928 . In the caustic words of Post reporter Philip Bump , " That whistling sound you hear is the party     . "   Movie fans will recognize that as a reference to the ending scene in the 1991 movie Thelma and Louise , in which the title characters drive off a cliff , plunging to their death . So the title characters happened ?   It seemed like only yesterday that the MSM , and the chattering classes overall , were certain that Hillary Clinton was destined for a decisive victory , possibly even a landslide .   Yet now , not so much . So today , the Democrats have something they did n’t particularly the Democrats for : the opportunity for an " agonizing reassessment . "   The problem is that such reassessments do n’t always end up improving the situation —   sometimes they make things worse the Democrats As former CNN pundit Bill Schneider liked to say , an election defeat gives the losing party a chance to " fix " whatever went wrong .   The big question , of course , is , " What needs fixing ? "   And now the    " autopsy " reports as to the needed fix are coming , one might say , fast and furious . To be sure , a few Hillary loyalists declare that their woman lost because a few Hillary loyalists " sexism , " or some other retrograde " . "   Many more Clintonites blame FBI Director James Comey shadowy Clinton operative Sidney Blumenthal has gone so far as to claim that the election was a " coup d’etat " staged by " a cabal of    agents of the FBI in the FBI office attached to Rudy Giuliani . "   Okay , so that ’s the thinking of a few Clintonite   . Meanwhile , most Democrats , and their    allies in the Democrats , are coming around to the view that Hillary was a deeply flawed candidate .   Here , for example , is the analysis of Politico ’s Glenn Thrush , writing that the failure of Clinton ’s campaign was :    …     proof that a conventional candidate can do practically everything by the numbers ( win debates , raise the most cash , assemble the greatest data and voter outreach effort in history ) and still fall to a movement impelled by raw emotion , not calculation . We might pause to say that other observers would dispute Thrush ’s assertion that Clinton won all the presidential debates it surely seemed that Trump punched through , for example , with , " You ’d be in jail , " thereby highlighting Clinton ’s      scandal . Clinton we could also add that We significant advantage that Clinton had going for her Clinton the active collusion Clinton the MSM , including , yes , the very same Glenn Thrush . So now , with the benefit of hindsight , all the defects of Clinton , and the Democrats Clinton and associated " experts , " have been made manifest .   Writing the day after the election , Politico ’s Michael Grunwald observed : The experts , it turned out , had no idea what they were talking about . The experts And that , it seems , was what last night ’s Trumpquake was about , a revolt against the experts , against the The experts against the        insiders . Again , it ’s funny how , after the fact , everyone can see the handwriting on the wall . Meanwhile , across the country , Democratic activists , who lean well to the left , are conducting their own " reassessment , " Democratic activists, who lean well to the left that ’s sure to affect     thinking , as well as future party personnel . A    poll , for example , commissioned by a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders , concluded that the Vermont socialist would have defeated Trump by an " historic margin . " Others might question the plausibility of the poll —   after all , it ’s the ultimate instance of the poll unprovable hypothetical —   and yet at the same time , it ’s obvious that Democratic activists the poll eager to believe it .   Even today , the poll days after Clinton ’s defeat , the Sanders people are already gearing up to take control of the state parties . Also in the wake of the election , a tide of street protest is roiling the country , and that anger is contagious , at least to the left .   Here’re the words of one young protestor in San Francisco : As a white , queer person , we need unity with people of color , we need to stand up .   I ’m fighting for my rights as an LGBTQ person . I ’m fighting for the rights of ’m people , black people , Muslim people . A Republican can dismiss such sentiments as just the ranting of a loony lefty .   And yet a Democrat ca n’t , because such voices are numerous , perhaps even predominant , at the Democratic grassroots . Moreover , the institutional Democrats in D. C. frozen out of power in the capital as they are , now lack any the institutional Democrats in D. C. of political bulwark from which to repel the activist onslaught . Indeed , the new trend of radical thinking has already bled into D. C.   We can see this from a November 10 news item in The Huffington Post : It seems that a Green activist this at the Democratic National Committee stood up in a DNC meeting and heckled Donna Brazile , the outgoing DNC chair .   As the young man , identified only as " Zach , " said to Brazile , " You are part Donna Brazile the problem , " referring to Brazile ’s early support for Clinton Donna Brazile .   And then Zach added this nutty oratorical fusillade : Zach and your friends will die of old age and I ’m going to die from climate change .   You and your friends let this happen , which your friends to cut 40 years off my life expectancy . Whereupon Zach stalked out of the room Zach Zach that crazed bit of speechifying    might strike most Americans as insane , but this is the mindset of Democratic activists these days : Losing has a way of running some people off the rails ( assuming they were ever on them ) . And so some people we see the some people predicate for that big pendulum swing looming    in the Democrats’ future : Democratic activists , enraged by what ’s happened in the last week , and blaming the establishment , are determined to " fix " the party ’s problem , even if , in their shortsightedness , such " fixing " actually makes the party problem worse . Thus we come to Rep. problem , the      Muslim Congressman from Minnesota .   A Friday headline in Politico tells us what ’s likely in Ellison ’s future : " Warren : Ellison would make a ‘ terrific’ DNC chair . " Ellison That would be , of course , Sen. Elizabeth Warren ’s endorsing Ellison to be the next "Warren Democratic National Ellison , succeeding Brazile . Indeed , later that same day , Sen. Bernie Sanders —   whom most Democratic activists see as the Great Victim of 2016 , as he was so obviously robbed by the    DNC —   endorsed "Warren .   Also endorsing was Sen. Chuck Schumer , Ellison incoming leader of the Senate Democrats .   So as we can see , looking toward the DNC election in January , Ellison has genuine momentum . So who is Keith Ellison Ellison   For one thing , he ’s Ellison of the Congressional Progressive Caucus indeed , Ellison has a    of zero ( on a zero to Ellison scale ) from the American Conservative Union . Under the headline , " Democrats Embrace Their Radicalism , " Commentary ’s Noah Rothman delves into him further : Democrats , a former disciple of Louis Farrakhan Ellison the Nation of Islam , has compared the    attacks to the Reichstag fire , implying that its effects —   the empowering of the Bush administration to prosecute the the Reichstag fire War on Terror —   was the attack ’s design . And so the rest of us might ask : How could the Democrats the Democrats radical man as their partisan spokesperson the Democrats   especially in 2017 , when so few other Democrats will have the national stage ?   In what electoral universe is Ellison an asset ?   Surely Ellison ’s brand of    politics Ellison n’t helpful to Democratic fortunes Ellison whole of Minnesota , to say nothing of the whole United States . Minnesota yet the Democrats want the Democrats because they ’re in a the Democrats mood . Of course , not Ellison Democrats are fiery radicals .   And they ca n’t be happy about the    of their party .   Yet at the not all Democrats time , when a wave is crashing , not all Democrats ’s often safer meekly to seek shelter , as opposed to standing up and confronting a wave at high noon .   So moderate Democrats are likely to remain well hidden during a wave DNC contest . In addition , it must be said that relatively few Americans , now or in the future , will ever be able to name the DNC Chair .   So in that sense , perhaps moderate Democrats are safe as they quietly seek    in 2018 , even as their party ’s ideological hothouse gets hotter perhaps moderate Democrats Yet beyond next year ’s DNC race , perhaps moderate Democrats a deeper dynamic at work .   That is , the choices that the Democrats make in 2017 will the Democrats be an early indicator of where they are headed in 2020 . To the Democrats this further , we can go back to Bill Schneider ’s point about a party Bill Schneider fixing " what went wrong .   That is , the Democrats’ collective understanding of why they lost in ’16 will guide them as they seek to win in ’20 .   We can further observe : If the Democrats diagnose they the Democrats they they the Democrats perhaps more likely the Democrats win in four years .   But if they do n’t get it the Democrats , then they are more likely to the Democrats disappointed once again . This is the lesson of political   : Parties need strong situational awareness if they are to have a chance to win , and yet in the tumult of    and    clarity of Parties is oftentimes lost .   This dynamic , we can further say , applies to both    —   although today , it ’s the Democrats’ turn to swing . We can offer a thesis Parties this    phenomenon : After a party loses the White House , the old guard —   the insider establishment —   is , by definition , discredited in the eyes of party activists .   After all , they lost !   And at the same time , it ’s hard for the activists to admit that something might be wrong with themselves and their beliefs .   Instead , activists typically scapegoat party activists candidate , and the campaign team , for the party activists . party activists And so power in the party reverts to the ideological base , as activists , having absolved themselves the party fault , proceed with full confidence that they are absolutely in the right .   Thus they nominate , for activists next presidential election , a candidate molded in their activists image —   a candidate of the base activists   And base candidates almost never win .   In other words activists there ’s a reason most incumbent presidents win a second term —   they draw a weak challenger .   Now , to be more    we can say that for Democrats , this      phenomenon most incumbent presidents nominating a    liberal —   or , as    Democrats prefer to call themselves these days , a " progressive . "   And by the same token , for the Republicans ,    means nominating a    conservative .   And yet true believers on either side of the aisle , God bless ‘ em , usually have a hard time getting to 51 percent . We can recall how this    plays out in political history ‘   In 1960 , for instance , Richard Nixon , the incumbent vice president , was defeated by John F. Kennedy .   Nixon ’s defeat —   even in a close election that might , in fact , have been stolen —   was a discrediting not only of Nixon , but also of the entire    Republican establishment .   And so party activists , instinctively and ideologically    gathered around Nixon iconic Sen. Barry Goldwater as they looked ahead to the next election in 1964 . The problem for Republicans , of course , was that Goldwater , ideologically party activists pure " as he might have been , was seen as too extreme by the country as a whole .   And so whereas Nixon the Goldwater lost narrowly in ’60 , Goldwater the    lost in a landslide in ’64 . We can quickly observe : Nixon this election year , the country was looking for an outsider , and yet sometimes the country in ’64 , the country is looking for an insider .   The challenge for the country is to read correctly the Zeitgeist , the spirit ’64 the age .   This year , as we know , Trump read it right , and     ago , Goldwater read it wrong . Interestingly , after Goldwater this election year , it was the conservative activists’ turn to this election year discredited , allowing the GOP Goldwater to make this election year comeback in the following Goldwater years .   Indeed , in 1968 the Republicans nominated   …      Richard the entire   Republican establishment Yes , Nixon , a pillar of the GOP , was the party ’s choice the Republicans time around .   And Nixon fact , Nixon won the party Nixon .   Thus we can see the pendulum had swung again , this time in the opposite direction , back to the establishment Nixon Yet of course , our purpose here is not to dope out a possible scenario for the next eight years , but rather , only for the the entire   Republican establishment years —   in particular , what will the Democrats be up to the Democrats and 2020 ?   And what sort of figure will they choose as their   ? the Democrats so to the Democrats illustrate the    phenomenon and where it leads , we can look back to history yet again , this time to the Democrats . The losing Democrat in 1968 , the Democrats , had , like Nixon in 1960 , been the incumbent vice president .   In other words , Humphrey was in the bosom of the establishment —   at least he was , Nixon he lost . And in fact , Humphrey was interested in running again in 1972 .   And yet the Democratic activists — the entire   Republican establishment pushed the establishment aside in an Humphrey mirroring the rise Humphrey Republican activists after 1960 —   Humphrey n’t interested in Humphrey .   Not in the least . Instead , Dem activists had their the entire   Republican establishment on Sen. George McGovern , who was a bit of a Democratic Barry Goldwater .   That is , McGovern Humphrey sweet music to the party base in the primaries , and so Dem activists won the ’72 nomination , and yet he was far too ideologically extreme to win the general election . We can observe that this pattern is consistent across the decades , in both parties . McGovern Again : After the " in " McGovern loses , the ideological activists take over and nominate one of their own —   and that ideological candidate loses even bigger than had the establishment candidate . Thus we can see why so many presidents —   the Democratic activists —   Bill Clinton , George W. Bush , and the Democratic activists —   Obama —   have been   .   That is , in his    campaign , the incumbent president is challenged by a base candidate who is simply too extreme to win . Here at this point some might object that the GOP candidate in 2012 , Mitt Romney , Romney no the incumbent vice president And that ’s true —   but he pretended to be one .   That is , Romney attempted to embrace , as the GOP said so awkwardly , " severely conservative " positions that a ) were not popular with     road voters , and b ) Romney knew he did n’t really mean , anyway .   So no wonder Romney lost Romney , and has not been missed since . By contrast , in 2016 , while Trump was no establishmentarian , he also did n’t pretend Romney be an orthodox conservative .   Instead , having rejected libertarian Romney dogma on such key issues as immigration and trade , he came across Trump pragmatic and centrist , Trump as he retained his populist edge .   And that ’s why he carried states that had n’t voted Republican since the 1980s . So now we Trump look ahead , with more clarity , at 2020 Trump   Trump we have seen , the Democrats are moving Trump , and they ’re likely the Democrats their next presidential nominee along with the Democrats .   Indeed , the Democrats the guiding stars in their the Democrats —   the PC protestors , some of them the Democrats , the growing energy around lefty champions such as the Democrats and Warren , the likely election of Keith Ellison to the DNC —   are aligning to produce a far    Democratic nominee in four years . And that , of Ellison is great news for President Trump if he seeks   .
