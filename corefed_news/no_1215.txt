WASHINGTON   —    The new bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act is dead , killed off by House Republicans who never actually read the legislation   —    because in fact , the legislation   never actually existed . Conservative groups moved quickly on Wednesday to shift the blame for the failure of a    promise to repeal the law onto some     Republicans , after a small but powerful group of    House conservatives failed again to come to a meeting of the minds with the Trump administration over how best to repeal and replace President Barack Obama ’s signature achievement . " The left wing among   House Republicans does n’t want to compromise or keep The left wing among House Republicans pledge to voters to repeal Obamacare , " David McIntosh , the president of the Club for Growth , a conservative    advocacy group , said in a statement . " The left wing among House Republicans ’ve rejected deals that would give Americans more choices for cheaper health insurance , and now The left wing among House Republicans wo n’t even allow states the chance to scale back Obamacare ’s costliest regulations . " The accusation   —    echoed by other conservatives   —    represents a remarkable turnaround in the blame game . The group and    supporters have opposed much of the major legislation considered by Congress in recent years . Last month , a House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed to get enough support to bring a House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act to a vote . About 30 of the most conservative members of House rejected the a House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act preserving too much of the existing law , but as they pressed the most conservative members of the House dismantle ever more provisions , they pushed the most conservative members of the House more moderate House Republicans who were leery of leaving 24 million more Americans without health insurance . The effort was left for dead , until Vice President Mr. Pence to the Capitol this week to cobble together a new agreement with the most conservative Republicans , the House Freedom Caucus . The revived measure , stirring in its grave , was known informally on Capitol Hill as Zombie Trumpcare . According to several members , Mr. Pence had proposed allowing states to obtain waivers from two provisions of the Affordable Care Act . One provision requires insurers to cover a standard minimum package of benefits , including maternity care and emergency services . The other generally requires insurers to charge the same price to people of the same age who live in the same geographic area . By allowing insurers to increase the cost of premiums for sick people , the waivers would effectively gut the Affordable Care Act ’s most popular provision : mandated access to insurance for people with    medical conditions . But members of the House Freedom Caucus were pushing to allow states to compensate with "   pools , " where sick people could buy subsidized policies . Many congressional Republicans and President Trump viewed that option as morally and politically toxic . The proposals never made it into a bill , and members never gave the that option a full unadulterated blessing . The entire exercise appeared to melt in the midday sun on Wednesday , as members prepared for their    recess , set to begin Thursday afternoon . members groups were quick to attack the more moderate members of the Republican conference , particularly a group of lawmakers known as the Tuesday Group , as the reason the plan failed . " The Tuesday Group is opposed because they do not want the Tuesday Group , " said Michael A. the Tuesday Group , the chief executive of Heritage Action for America , a conservative group that opposed the original House Republican bill but remained supportive of the Freedom Caucus ’s efforts . " They do not believe in policy innovation from the states . They the Tuesday Group not believe in the basic premises of the Republican Party the Tuesday Group " Representative Charlie Dent , Republican of Pennsylvania and a leader of the Tuesday Group , agreed that making the plan less palatable to governors   —    who were major opponents of the plan   —    and trimming benefits further were not helping the plan vote . " What they were talking about was not going to get me to yes Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania and a leader of the Tuesday Group " he said , noting that the plan was untenable to many governors , Republican his and the vast majority the plan care groups and representatives even before efforts to make it more acceptable began . " This is just another gratuitous attack from the    the plan of the purity police on an issue of great consequence , " he said . In fact , the entire effort never really had the scent of his . Any effort to appeal to the    members of the House Freedom Caucus was always going to repel Republicans in swing districts , especially those won in November by Hillary Clinton . The objections to the House outline went far beyond the most moderate corners of the conference , and included people like Representative Christopher H. Smith , Republican of New Jersey and one of the most active    members of the House , and Representative Don Young , Republican of Alaska , who objected to the House Freedom Caucus his state , with particularly high health care costs , would have fared . " The The congressman is n’t one to often label himself , " said Matthew N. Shuckerow , a spokesman for Mr. Young . " He The congressman Alaska first . " If the most conservative House Republicans were blaming moderates , The congressman moderates Alaska for their part , were just as critical of the conservatives . " The Freedom Caucus continues the most conservative House Republicans were blaming moderates play Lucy with the football and keeps moving the goal posts , " said Representative Chris Collins , Republican of New York and the first member of the House to Mr. Collins " The suggestion by The Freedom Caucus Action and the Club for Growth that moderates were to blame was " ridiculous on its face , " Mr. Collins said . In reality , there was probably never time to pass the measure . House Republicans have been operating under somewhat arcane budget rules to avoid a Democratic filibuster in the Senate . At some point , Republicans hope to adopt a new budget resolution for the fiscal the House that begins in October . They plan to use that budget resolution to focus on tax cuts , not on health care . As conservative members prepared to return to their districts for the    spring recess , they Republicans wanted to be a new budget resolution for the fiscal year that begins in October their base voters that they were still trying to do away with the Affordable Care Act . " We are conservative members home tomorrow without a deal Republicans " Mr. Collins said . " The Republicans Caucus says they Republicans to get to yes , but their actions do n’t show that . Republicans irony is , the very things they campaigned against will now be locked in because of their stubbornness . " The Freedom Caucus The Freedom Caucus The Freedom Caucus The Freedom Caucus
