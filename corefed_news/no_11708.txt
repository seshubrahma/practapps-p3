Billionaire and millionaire GOP donors have wasted more than half a billion dollars collectively in trying to take down 2016 Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump , a new report from the Center for Public Integrity published by Time Magazine shows . [ Just on GOP candidates that have since dropped out of the race against Trump , a new report from the Center for Public Integrity published by Time Magazine found , donors have wasted a whopping $ 520 million . That amount does n’t account for Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) or Ohio Gov. John Kasich , the only two remaining out of 16 total candidates against Trump Trump   The the Center for Public Integrity Carrie Levine wrote : So far , donors have funneled more than $ 520 million collectively into campaigns and outside groups supporting Republican presidential candidates who have now dropped out   —    and the primaries are far from over . Only U. S. Sen. Ted Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the only two remaining out of 16 total candidates against Trump primary , and they ’re aggressively courting those Ohio once wrote checks to their opponents . But some GOP megadonors with millions Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the only two remaining out of 16 total candidates against Trump dollars to spend have n’t selected a new date Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the only two remaining out of 16 total candidates against Trump the presidential dance . Others are on the arms of their second and third choices . While Trump is taking donations , Trump is not soliciting them Trump and Others largely    his entire presidential campaign . Trump ’s highly successful presidential Trump has infuriated donations , hence many have tried to hatchet his momentum —   and Trump every case thus far , they have failed . As Trump continues to succeed , Trump these donors continue to fail , Levine noted donors some of those donors are surrendering to Trump —   donors Trump abandon the field for now and instead funnel resources donors races . " " Some key political groups dedicated to promoting Republican congressional candidates say they ’re seeing interest from donors who would otherwise be focused on the presidential race , " Levine wrote before quoting Some key political groups dedicated to promoting Republican congressional candidates Prior —   a GOP operative who represents not just a Super PAC backing GOP candidates Levine U. S. Senate races but also works for Karl Rove ’s American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS . Prior , quoted here in his capacity as the communications director for the GOP Super Pac " Senate Leadership Fund super PAC " and for    GOP nonprofit group One Nation , said , " There have certainly been consistent concerns with the tenor and tone of the Republican nominating process . " As such , Prior added , " The fight to keep the Senate has become one where there has been increased interest , focus , and attention from the donor community . " Ultimately , according to Levin , most donors who have given big amounts in this presidential campaign have come up   . " For instance , members of the Ricketts family , which owns the Chicago Cubs , contributed $ 5 million to a super PAC supporting Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker ’s presidential bid , " Levine wrote . " Since Walker withdrew in September , the Ricketts have not thrown substantial support behind another presidential candidate . But since January , a super PAC supporting Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s of the Ricketts family have contributed $ 5 million to an    effort , according to campaign finance reports filed with the the Ricketts family . " The    Ending Spending Action Fund ’s Brian Baker noted that " Everyone is all over the map " when it comes to whether to shift to backing yet another GOP candidate , and instead the Ricketts’ efforts have shifted more into Senate races like the one brewing in New Hampshire where Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( ) is fending off not just primary challenges but a strong general election bid from Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan . The Ricketts’ are hardly the only donors in the doldrums . Levine continued : Another Republican megadonor , billionaire investor Paul Singer , Ricketts’ S. Sen. Marco Rubio until he suspended his campaign earlier this month . Singer is also reportedly boosting    efforts one Rubio fundraiser who attended a meeting of supporters Levine before Levine Florida primary this month said Singer was outspoken on the subject of Trump , referring to him as a ‘ plague.’ Singer did not respond to earlier this month through his Singer about his political spending plans and his comments about Levine . New campaign finance reports filed Sunday show Singer gave $ 1 Levine to the Levine Our Principles PAC . Levine story continues by Trump how two    in Texas who originally backed former Texas Gov. Rick Perry —   Welcome Wilson , Sr . and his son Welcome Wilson , Jr. —   have shifted to now backing Texas , with the younger of the two backing his high school classmate former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the middle . " I never support more than one candidate at a time , but I need to be realistic , " the elder Wilson said . They ’ve attended fundraisers for Cruz recently and are still trying to help the Texas senator . " Wilson said his politically inclined associates are still willing to attend presidential Cruz he ’s hosting , " Levine wrote . " Wilson cites what the elder Wilson described the elder Wilson a    fundraising breakfast he recently conducted for Cruz , the elder Wilson featured the senator ’s wife , Heidi Cruz the elder Wilson " Picking the elder Wilson the defeated candidates’ donors is a the elder Wilson battle the Cruz campaign is fighting for the Texas senator Mica Mosbacher told Levine . " We asked folks in , say , the Bush or Rubio camp to consider Cruz as a second , Cruz , fourth choice , Levine Mosbacher said . " Money is not drying up for Cruz . His path is still Cruz . " Cruz does seem to the establishment ’s last Cruz fundraiser Mica Mosbacher to stop Trump , as even arch enemies of Cruz like Cruz fundraiser Mica Mosbacher Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney —   Cruz 2012 GOP nominee who failed to win the presidential election —   and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( Trump among others , have now aligned behind him . The question is whether this realignment of the Washington establishment behind Cruz is happening too late , or if there will be enough time left Trump stop Trump heading into the final stages of this presidential primary . Cruz ’s lingering in the race is likely to have an effect on the outcome , and it ’s unclear at this time whether Kasich remaining helps Cruz or Trump —   or hurts both of them —   more . But ultimately , the race Cruz ’s efforts to get the Kasich class behind Cruz for Trump last    push is n’t going Cruz or Trump well as the Cruz team may hope Cruz Cruz her piece by noting . " In contrast , two ‘ bundlers’ who raised money for Bush ’s campaign and subsequently for Rubio ’s effort said some donors in their networks are reluctant to support yet another presidential candidate , " Levine wrote . " This is forcing the bundlers to be judicious as they consider their next move . Both men asked not to be named , saying they Levine n’t want Trump , Cruz or Kasich   —    or other the bundlers candidates the bundlers for that matter the bundlers    nagging them for money . One campaign the bundlers said he will likely support Cruz . Another said that for now , he ’s taking a break from presidential fundraising   — the bundlers and may look at supporting Senate candidates One campaign bundler instead . " Cruz One campaign bundler
