  ( CNN ) Occasionally Donald Trump says something that is politically incorrect but which also happens to be true .   On Tuesday at a campaign rally in North Carolina , Donald Trump defended the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein ’s record on terrorism , saying , " Donald Trump was a bad guy     really bad guy . But you know what ? Donald Trump did well ? Donald Trump killed terrorists . Donald Trump did that so well . They did n’t read They the rights . They did n’t talk . They were terrorists . Over . Today , Iraq is Harvard for terrorism . "   Defending the brutal Iraqi dictator who killed hundreds of thousands of his own people is n’t exactly fashionable . But if you consider the 13 years of war that have wracked the country     in which a quarter of a million have died     and add that Saddam brutally repressed all dissent , including groups such as al Qaeda , and also add to this that ISIS is ISIS a fruit of the Iraq War , ISIS ’s a far more defensible position .     Trump did n’t offer any evidence for Trump assertions about Saddam ’s brutal repression of terrorist groups or of Saddam " killing terrorists , " but Trump observations about Saddam are an implicit critique of the George W. Bush administration ’s erroneous claims before the the Iraq War Saddam Saddam allied to al Qaeda . Those claims were ’s erroneous claims before the Iraq War that Saddam was allied to al Qaeda element of the case that the administration made the George W. Bush administration to war , since Saddam Saddam supposed connections to al Qaeda were the only al Qaeda that he might give his putative weapons al Qaeda destruction to al Qaeda .   The centerpiece of the Bush administration ’s the George W. Bush administration to war in Iraq was Secretary of State Colin Powell ’s presentation to the U. N. Security Council on February 5 , 2003 , six weeks before the invasion . Powell ’s presentation was a bravura performance that Secretary of State Colin Powell’s establish beyond a doubt that Saddam was actively concealing an ongoing weapons of mass destruction program and was in league with   .    At one point the secretary of state dramatically brandished a small vial of a white powder of supposed anthrax , saying " about this amount . .. shut down the U. S. Senate in the fall of 2001 . " As Powell gave his speech , sitting directly behind him was CIA Powell George Tenet , giving a Powell imprimatur to what Powell was saying .    One section of Powell Powell UN speech tried to make the case Powell an emerging alliance between Saddam and   :   " Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab    an associate and collaborator of Osama bin Laden and his    lieutenants . .. When our coalition ousted Osama bin Laden Taliban , the Zarqawi network helped establish another poison and explosive a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab   an associate and collaborator of Osama bin Laden and his   lieutenants , and this camp is located in northeastern Iraq . .. He traveled another poison and explosive training center camp in May of 2002 for medical treatment , staying in the capital of Iraq for two months while he recuperated to fight another day . Iraq Five weeks before the He of Iraq , CIA director Tenet testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee Iraq Iraq had " provided training in poisons and gases to two    Iraq , " a point that Powell had also made in his U. N. presentation .   What the American public did not CIA director Tenet about Tenet ’s and Powell ’s crucial claim about Iraq training    associates CIA director Tenet poison gases Powell that it did n’t Iraq a nexus between bin Laden , Saddam and associates on poison gases of the world ’s nastiest weapons . Instead , it was the tainted fruit of an " extraordinary rendition " in which militants were transported by American officials to countries that routinely used torture , where they would supposedly finally divulge whatever secrets they had been keeping from countries that routinely used torture, where they would supposedly finally divulge whatever secrets they had been keeping from their American interrogators American interrogators . In December 2001 countries that routinely used torture, where they would supposedly finally divulge whatever secrets they had been keeping from their American interrogators al Shaykh al Libi countries that routinely used torture, where they would supposedly finally divulge whatever secrets they had been keeping from their American interrogators American Libyan militant who had run an     training camp , was captured in Pakistan . Libi told his FBI interrogators that there were no ties between Saddam and   Libi Several days into his interrogation the CIA then rendered Libi to Egypt , where jailors Libi known for subjecting their prisoners Libi beatings , electric shocks and sexual assaults .   Saddam and   improve his chances of better treatment once in Egypt , Libi told his Libi that bin Laden had sent two Egypt to Libi to Libi about biological and chemical weapons .    Because Libi ’s story encapsulated the key arguments for the Iraq war , Libi was picked up by President Bush in a keynote speech in Libi on October 7 , 2002 in which he laid out his rationale for the coming conflict with Iraq , saying Libi " We Libi learned that Iraq has trained    Iraq in    and poisons and deadly gases . Iraq   But once he was back in American custody , on February 14 , 2004 , Libi recanted what he had falsely told his Egyptian interrogators . Libi told his U. S. Libi that he had Libi fabricated " his Libi of Libi      connection to the Libi following " physical abuse Libi threats of torture . " Two and a half years into the Iraq war , in October 2005 , the CIA released a report that finally disposed of the myth that Saddam and the leader of    in Iraq , Zarqawi , had ever been in league , assessing that prior Iraq the war , " the regime did not a have a relationship , the Iraq war or turn a blind eye towards Zarqawi . "    Since the fall of Baghdad no documents have been unearthed in Iraq proving the     axis despite the fact that , like other totalitarian Iraq , Saddam ’s government kept meticulous records . The Defense Intelligence Agency had by 2006 translated 34 million pages of documents from Saddam ’s Iraq and found there was nothing to substantiate a " partnership Iraq Saddam’s . Two years later the Pentagon ’s own internal think tank , the Saddam for Defense Analyses ( IDA ) concluded after examining 600 , 000    documents and several thousand hours of his regime ’s audio and video tapes that there was no " smoking gun ( i. Saddam direct connection between Saddam ’s Iraq and   . ) "   Join us on Facebook . .   In June 2008 the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded , as every other investigation had before , that there was no " cooperative relationship " between Saddam and   . The committee also found that " most of the contacts cited between Iraq Saddam   ’ida before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence by the intelligence community and policy makers have been determined Iraq to have occurred . "   Also on Wednesday , after a    investigation , the British inquiry into the Iraq War known as the Chilcot report was released . It found that before the war British intelligence repeatedly assessed there was no connection between Iraq and al the British inquiry into the Iraq War known as the Chilcot report .   Trump the Iraq War British a student of the English political philosopher Hobbes , who wrote his masterwork " Leviathan " in the shadow of the English Civil War . But he seems to have grasped Hobbes’ main point : that an absolute " sovereign " ( i. e. dictator Trump was preferable to " the war of all against all " that characterized the civil war in    century England as well as much of the civil war that continues to wrack    century Iraq .   And Trump ’s claim that following the fall of Saddam , Iraq has emerged as the " Harvard " of terrorism is correct because Zarqawi in 2004 merged his terrorist Iraq with al Qaeda to create " Al Qaeda in Iraq , " which is the parent the "Harvard" of terrorism of today ’s ISIS .
