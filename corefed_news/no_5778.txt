Migrants covered by former President Obama ’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) continue making demands to President Donald Trump . [ A group of DACA recipients gathered for a press conference in Connecticut , home to some 8 , 500 DACA recipients , to express that some 8, 500 DACA recipients were " here today to let everyone know we ’re not going back in the shadows , " as Connecticut Students for a Dream    Camila Bortoletto told WNPR .   " It ’s a different time , It ’s a tough time , " Camila Bortoletto said . " It ’s definitely a scarier time than we ’ve had in the past . " Another DACA recipient , Eric Cruz Lopez , complained that some ‘ DREAMers,’ as the mainstream media has dubbed Another DACA recipient, Eric Cruz Lopez , are being deported under Trump ’s Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) . " DACA for a lot of undocumented immigrants meant relief , it meant protection , it meant something , it meant a win , " Lopez told the media . " But that does n’t mean anything anymore , right ? As we see DACA recipients being picked up , that    relief of deportation does n’t mean anything to anybody anymore . " Lopez is most likely referring to     Daniel Ramirez Medina , who was a DACA recipient that was most recently arrested by the Immigration and Customs Agency ( ICE ) agency after they said Lopez is a "   gang member . " As Breitbart Texas reported , the mainstream media covered Medina ’s arrest as a plight for other DACA recipients , failing to point out Lopez alleged gang relations across the West Coast . Connecticut ’s DACA recipients are now telling others   to not apply for the program until after there is clarity on the issue from the Trump Administration .
