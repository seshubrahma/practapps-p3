’   ’ ’    Joe Lonsdale was a little bit nervous as Joe Lonsdale shook my hand    and flashed Joe Lonsdale trademark wide grin . Joe Lonsdale tall ,      frame , in a white dress shirt and black dress slacks , towered    over my     self . No jeans . No hoodie . Joe Lonsdale dressed    respectfully for this rare interview with a journalist . ’ ’    We were on Joe Lonsdale home turf at Joe Lonsdale airy San Francisco offices , and    Joe Lonsdale had      pro Dena Cook at Joe Lonsdale side . I got    the impression that this moment sums up    personality    perfectly : a ton of confidence thanks to smarts and preparation ,    mingled with a touch of nerves , the kind of nerves that make you    want to step up to a challenge , not back down . ’ ’    Lonsdale is like the living embodiment of Silicon Valley all    rolled up into one person : young , smart , geeky , financially    successful , optimistic , passionate , outspoken , and , at times ,    controversial , not to mention    involvement in some pretty    scandalous lawsuits . ’ ’    As a rule ,    refuses to do interviews with the press . " I don’’t    see the upside in it , "    explained . ’ ’       made an exception for me after we met as speakers at a tech    conference and had an enjoyable lunch together . Even so , it took    months of pestering    people before    tentative " yes " turned    into a date and time . ’ "    It ’s not that Lonsdale is shy of talking in public   —    Lonsdale speaks    often at tech conferences . And Lonsdale ’s been known to write candid    and insightful   the online Q&A forum . For instance , Lonsdale once    answered the question   about Lonsdale occasional , noticeably odd    jerky movements , often a facial twitch . " ’    " I agree it is pretty weird   —    I think everyone is just being    polite , but I do n’t mind the question , " . " It ’s    part of a twitch that seems to move around , and comes up a lot ,    and we have n’t been able to figure out why but I ’ve had some    version of    since I was very young . " ’ "    But Lonsdale ’s relationship with the press is complicated , and    the stories about    have not always been kind . " ’    The worst of it happened in 2015 when an    sued    ,    alleging emotional and sexual abuse . The allegations fit into a    troubling pattern of reports about discrimination and sexism in    Silicon Valley , and the headlines publicly vilified Lonsdale . Lonsdale    alma mater , Stanford , where Lonsdale had been a guest lecturer and    where the woman had been a student , kicked Lonsdale off campus . Lonsdale     and argued Lonsdale had evidence that validated Lonsdale    innocence . ’ "    Lonsdale was , ironically enough , also helped by the press , such    as   that    depicted Lonsdale ex as an emotionally fragile woman , Lonsdale as an    awkward    and their relationship as something that was n’t    particularly good for either of their . " "    Both suits were eventually dropped and Stanford removed    ban    on Lonsdale , but the damage to Lonsdale reputation in 2015 was intense . In    the backdrop of that , Lonsdale VC firm , . The partners had differing investing    philosophies , and The partners personality conflicts were exacerbated by    Lonsdale ’s public problems , . " ’    Flash forward two years , and Lonsdale , 34 , is happy , and he    considers he " a lucky guy , " a term he used repeatedly to    describe he life to me . ’ "    he ’s the head of a new venture firm   run by five partners that ’s raised over $ 400    million . he ’s newly married to he    girlfriend , and the    couple just welcomed the   couple first child , a baby girl , into the    world . he ’s even become known for he    dinners . he has    once again been embraced in Silicon Valley . " ’    This is a story of resilience and the kind of second chances that Silicon Valley Silicon Valley a segment of its members , Silicon Valley    its young successful Silicon Valley turned power brokers . ’ "    And that ’s why he was wary of me on that he spring day as I    sat in his leather couch he    office . But as we talked ,    the nervousness faded . There was no twitch . Instead ,    Lonsdale and I had a candid discussion about : " "    Lonsdale is probably   Lonsdale known as one of the cofounders of    Palantir , a    company that raised $ 2 . 8 billion in venture    funding , is valued at $ 21 billion , and has a reputation for being    super secretive . He ’s no   Lonsdale with the company ,    ’s      Lonsdale named as an adviser . " ’   ’ "    While he ’s not   Lonsdale a member of the powerful group of    PayPal founders affectionately known as the PayPal mafia , he was      Lonsdale intern for two summers at the company before it       became    protege of one of them : Palantir ’s billionaire two summers at the company    Peter Thiel . " "    Lonsdale is also known as the cofounder and first CEO of      software startup Addepar ( where he ’s still the    Lonsdale ) . " ’    All this before he turned 30 . ’ Lonsdale    He has since invested in Lonsdale of startups as an angel investor    and through the VC companies he founded . He ’s Lonsdale the board Lonsdale    several    startups , including Hyperloop One , which is    working on the     system envisioned by Elon Musk . " "    When he agreed to this interview Lonsdale there was one restriction : He    would n’t discuss Lonsdale of either of the two big lawsuits that    involved him , citing    . Lonsdale involved Hyperloop One .    The suit was brought    a cofounder and other employees who    alleged company executives misused funds , violated California    labor code , and threatened at least one employee by . The company    denied the allegations , and the . " ’    The other was the suit by his   . But he was willing    to his how that    episode influenced his views of the    his . ’ ’    After his ex made her allegations his his alma The woman , Stanford his    barred him from campus    The his was a student there and he had    been an his "    " for a course on entrepreneurialism .    Lonsdale reportedly presented Stanford with his that he Stanford    helped verify his innocence , but it his only after   on the case    that the Stanford investigator   and the Stanford lifted its ban . ’ ’ the Stanford investigator  and the school Lonsdale is hardly what most his would consider    disenfranchised . But the    made him distrust authorities . He his felt like his his    being ignored his as if he was railing    against his machine , which he says made him sympathize his what    his have felt like over the years as they fought against    institutional women . ’ ’    " The whole experience gave me a lot of empathy for the women who    had to deal with this in the past , " he told me . "    was clear    that few of the lawyers or other bureaucrats involved cared about    things like truth or      —    they only cared about protecting few of the lawyers or other bureaucrats involved cared about   things like truth or honor      institution . " ’ ’    " It also gave me a new appreciation for the anger felt at how the    system failed thousands of women who were just ignored or , worse ,    laughed at , in the past decades , " he said . " All    recent rules    and pressure from DC did was to sometimes flip who was treated    unfairly . The entire    can only be changed by strong    leaders who care about honor . " ’ ’    On a personal level , the ordeal caused him to the ordeal of    people . ’ ’    " It’ ’s made me a lot more careful about who I let into my life and    who I trust , " he said . " I was It’ lucky that I met my now wife    before then . " ’ "    But Lonsdale said the fallout from his lawsuit was n’t the worst    thing that ever happened to him . He went through his period his that was rougher , he said , and in his ways it toughened him up    to survive his thrive after his very bad , awful his . " ’    His most difficult year was his , he said . His mom his passed    his and he was having failures with his at Palantir , which    had been founded four years earlier . He had also overextended    his . ’ ’       I was having a tough time , and I was doing all these things . And    there was some politics . Some people were threatened by me around    Peter , so the whole thing was a really tough year , " he said . " I    Peter make a lot of mistakes . I probably shouted at people that    did n’t need to be    at . " ’ ’    When that year was over , he a really tough year start something new Peter    Addepar . " It was clear it was time to replace myself and clear it    was me right time to it    , " he said . " Peter was Peter supportive    and Peter me on that .    had already vested all my shares and    became an adviser to Palantir .    ’ " Palantir Palantir CEO Alex Karp was also OK with his move . If he had n’t Palantir CEO Alex Karp been , Lonsdale Palantir CEO Alex Karp have stayed until his could have left on his    terms . " ’    " I do get bothered a little bit by the culture in Silicon Valley , Silicon Valley there ’s not as much loyalty and dedication to these    things , " he said . " I think his general it’ ’s really important to    follow It’ on your responsibilities and transition at the    right time . " ’ ’    Lonsdale was in some ways born his raised to confront conflict    and win . ’ ’    He grew up in Silicon Valley his the Silicon Valley Bay town of    Fremont , where his parents stretched to afford their house his    send their three boys to his parents schools . ’ ’ his parents ’ ’    " I was really lucky about two things about my life as a kid . I    had awesome parents and I had awesome peers , " his parents . ’ ’    But his family of three boys also had his else : an    unrelenting drive to win . ’ ’    " Our family is very , very competitive . But it’ his family of three boys fun and    inspiring sort It’ competitive . It makes you proud of what you do It’    and makes you want to work hard , and do    your homework , so you    can win , " he said . ’ ’       instance , he credits    dad for training him to break a            in    breaststroke in grade    . ’ ’    " I was the only one doing    and    because what       kid does that ? " he joked . ’ ’    With his inner drive and    parents ’’ coaching , Lonsdale and       brainy friends    his championships his a team coached by his    dad . He graduated valedictorian his had " mostly his test    scores , " and landed a coveted spot to attend Stanford University . ’ "    At Stanford , he joined the university ’s Stanford group his      students and its Libertarian paper , the Stanford Review . " ’    ’ "   At Stanford It ’s not as much about the politics as it was about being    contrarian . Hopefully , I ’m slightly more mature now , but I ’ve    always relished standing out from the crowd , standing up and    disagreeing with everyone , " he said . " If    had his up in    Arkansas , I would have joined up with the    club . " ’ ’    A lot of this parallels the background of his billionaire mentor ,    Peter Thiel , who also grew up in Silicon Valley , was a Silicon Valley genius , went to Stanford , and is a notorious contrarian and Stanford Libertarian . Thiel was a founder of the Stanford Review   Peter Thiel ’ "    Although Lonsdale did n’t know the Stanford Review he ’ "   At Stanford      Peter Thiel at PayPal his that job helped him get an internship at    Thiel ’s his company , a hedge fund   Peter Thiel where he soon captured    Thiel    attention .   Peter Thiel ’    "   Peter Thiel actually hired people around me and I helped launch projects    and   Peter Thiel did n’t realize at the time that that ’s not what interns    did . I thought you just started building stuff , if you were    there    To Peter ’s credit , he put up with it Peter n’t say , Peter Who    does this kid think he is ? ’’ " Lonsdale laughed . ’ ’ Peter ’ ’ his These days , many people in Silicon Valley are upset at Thiel Silicon Valley his politics and his perceived     Peter Thiel For instance ,    Thiel helped elect Donald Trump , a      Peter Thiel   Peter Thiel    much of Silicon Valley , and remains his adviser Silicon Valley also    secretly funded a lawsuit that   Peter Thiel the Gawker   Peter Thiel site . ’ "    Lonsdale is n’t on board with all of Thiel ’s his his ’    " ’ "   At Stanford   Peter Thiel him on a lot , but he ’s also a genius and    his who’ ’s a very good his to learn from about business , "    he said . ’ ’    For example    being contrarian is " his for investing and    entrepreneurship " because it helps people to " think differently , "    he said . ’ ’    As for politics , Lonsdale still leans his but said , " I care a    lot his about making sure we create opportunities and help the    bottom of our society as one of our key duties , one of our    highest duties . " ’ ’    His political activism comes in the form of founding our ,    like   which our    financial software to help governments manage taxes and share    best practices . ’ "    Lonsdale credits Palantir ’s CEO Karp for    him become more    his . Karp studied philosophy under the University Palantir CEO Alex Karp Habermas . " ’    " One of my biggest Palantir CEO Alex Karp His in my life was Alex    Karp of Palantir , " Lonsdale said , calling him " a very thoughtful    person . " From his , he saw " there’ ’s truth on both extremes , and    if you are missing one Alex   Karp of Palantir , Palantir CEO Alex Karp become a very lopsided person . " ’ " Alex   Karp of Palantir For all his antiauthority proclivities , Lonsdale ’s biggest    success in tech is a company that was created for his of    helping governments conduct intelligence and spy work by Alex   Karp of Palantir    through oceans of data . " ’   ’ "    Palantir ’s roster of clients   —    which include the CIA and various    other international agencies   —    and the company ’s reputation for    secrecy have given it a veneer of mystery that sets it apart from    the typical    Silicon Valley startup . " ’    This has led to   about the company and   secrecy work it does . ’ "   secrecy But Lonsdale said Palantir ’s reputation for secrecy is simply an    inherited quirk and not his indication of some sort of evildoing . This ’    At first , the company was Palantir because its roster of brilliant    but geeky people were more focused on building the product and    persuading rather secretive government agencies like the CIA the company’s FBI , and M16 the company’s use it , rather than broadly marketing it , he    said . ’ ’    And then the secrecy became CIA a cultural thing . ’ ’    " At all the product companies , when companies get the product successful , they    tend to enshrine their quirks , " Lonsdale said . He cited Apple and    its reputation for secrecy as an example his ’ ’ his But cultural secrecy no companies Palantir , Lonsdale    companies . " I disagree with their PR strategy . I    Apple his    responsibility and should engage more , " he said . ’ ’   ’ ’    After leaving Palantir altogether and vacating the his ’ ’   But cultural secrecy no longer serves Palantir, Lonsdale    at    Addepar to become ’ ’   But cultural secrecy no longer serves Palantir, Lonsdale    chairman , Lonsdale has now moved on from    his focus in his 20s as an entrepreneurial exec Palantir ’ ’    " There are his who are his managers than I am   Addepar I aspire to    be a really good manager , but it’ ’s not my natural personality to    do the same thing for 14 hours a day It’ I have a lot of different    interests . I really like product and strategy and business    strategy , and I think    ’m not bad at it , " he said . ’ "    That means he    involved in a dizzying number of companies It’    between his angel investments , 8VC It’ and his earlier VC    investments , plus the boards of It’ , like Strive for    College It’ which helps students apply to colleges . Although he says    he sleeps six to seven hours a night , he says he ’s a It’    workaholic It’ to balance his new life as husband and It’ . It’ ’    " I have a lot of It’ . There ’s like this fantasy where    you could sneak    to the beach instead , " he said . " Right now    that ’s on my mind . How do I make It’ ? " ’ "    Still , he learned a big lesson about the value of his work when    one of these companies It’ saved his    ’s life    and possibly It’ wife ’s . " ’    Last year , It’ few months before his wedding day It’ his fiancée       Tayler Cox , discovered she had    gene that It’ a high risk It’ of cancer . She found out because Lonsdale had a genetic test    laying around the house from   backed    by his his fund . ’ ’    " I had an extra test from this she his cared about . So my wife    just did it on a whim , and she found out that she has this risk , "    he said . After that , she had her mom take the possibly his wife came out    positive possibly his wife an    gene . The possibly his wife and her doctor possibly his wife decided to remove her ovaries preventatively    ’ ’   ’ ’ possibly his wife " possibly his wife they go a genetic test   laying around the house from  backed   by his previous fund take them out and they find stage 3 cancer , "    he said possibly his wife " Which is terrifying . possibly his wife , we were able to get    her surgery , get her The mom and her doctor    , and she seems The mom and her doctor    be in The mom and her doctor    remission    right now . If we    n’t done that , we ’d be losing her this year . " ’       While Lonsdale had    been investing in    startups ,    he ’s now even more gung his about we market . " "    we again his he    he ca n’t help feel extremely fortunate . " ’    " I’’m a his guy his be in my position . I ’m very lucky I really    enjoy what I’’m doing , " he flashed that wide smile . " I’’m a lucky    guy . " ’ ’Joe his was a little bit nervous as . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
