The organized outrage over    Trump ’s plans to deport up to 2 , 000 , 000 criminal aliens has the look and smell of identity politics . [ How and why convicted criminals became a privileged political constituency instead of over law abiding legal immigrants remains a mystery .   The identity politics behind " sanctuary cities " failed Hillary Clinton miserably , and The identity politics behind "sanctuary cities may yet prove to be the Achilles heel of big city Democrat mayors as well . There ’s a new sheriff in town , and a new sheriff in town has both the law and public opinion on a new sheriff in town side . Sanctuary city advocates in Los Angeles , Denver , Atlanta , New York and other cities are about to be confronted by a Congress and federal law   enforcement agencies united in a simple mission : to enforce the law . News bulletin : Deporting criminal aliens is not a new concept . Deporting criminal aliens was accepted policy across the nation until Political Correctness replaced common sense . Are citizens in rebellion against deporting the    criminal aliens currently serving jail terms in Colorado ’s local jails and state prison facilities ? No , only the political establishment finds the idea repugnant . Memo to Governors Brown , Hickenlooper and Cuomo : Your political stupidity is no longer protected by the Obama White House and Justice Department . You will soon experience the full force of federal law enforcement backed by congressional funding prohibitions and public outrage over your criminally negligent behavior . The Trump administration and Congress understand that sanctuary city policies have nothing to do with protecting children and families . Obstructing the legitimate enforcement of federal immigration law is about protecting convicted criminals from the consequences of their criminal behavior . Urban politicians will soon learn there are consequences for Urban politicians criminally negligent behavior as well . There is considerable hypocrisy in the statements issued this past week by mayors and governors proclaiming , " We will not help federal officials enforce federal immigration law . " As to the arguments heard every day in defense of sanctuary city policies , sanctuary city policies are hollow and unpersuasive to most Americans . The inconvenient truth is that ending sanctuary city policies is a step toward equal justice for all , citizen and illegal immigrant alike . Criminal aliens are not deserving of additional protections not available to citizens and legal immigrants . Ending criminal aliens’ exemptions from federal law enforcement will mean removing tens of thousands of dangerous felons from our communities . Why is that goal even controversial ?   Ask the Service Employee International Union ( SEIU ) whose membership and treasury have   ballooned under sanctuary policies . What are the real numbers ? How many criminal aliens will be affected by the unobstructed enforcement of federal immigration law ? As everyone knows , President Obama restricted the list of crimes that trigger deportation to a small number of violent felonies , not all felonies . As a result , since 2010 annual deportation numbers declined dramatically . President Trump may decide to simply tell ICE agents , " Enforce federal immigration law as written by Congress . " In that case , ICE might well start deportation processing for all 1 . 9 million criminal aliens deportable under current law . Or , Trump President Trump decide to limit initial deportations to all felons . The point is that Trump President Trump to enforce the federal immigration law of ignoring the law federal immigration law a novel concept ! How many criminal aliens does each state have ? That information is not readily available but can be found through diligent sifting through government documents , especially the annual reports by the US Department of Justice on reimbursement grants to state and local jails under the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program ( SCAAP ) . It is astonishing how many newspaper reporters have never looked at those annual reports and reported on the number of criminal aliens in local jails . What the state CDOC data do not reveal is that local jails in Colorado also receive annual SCAAP reimbursement grants for partial reimbursement of the costs to county taxpayers . In 2015 that total was $ 1 , 408 , 900   —    more than the state prison system ’s grant . In 2016 across the nation , the total number of criminal aliens in our jails and prisons is more than 300 , 000 . Now , ask yourself   —     what is the difference in how those convicted criminals are treated in Sanctuary cities and states compared to places where federal law is being enforced ? What happens to those 300 , 000 convicted criminals when they are released those 300, 000 convicted criminals jail in 2016 or 2017 ? Under sanctuary policies , how many would be turned over to ICE and deported ? The answer : only a small fraction . It is not public opinion that stands in the way of deporting all criminal alien felons . Even in progressive California , a large majority of citizens support deportation policies . A University of California survey in 201 5 discovered that 74 % of Californians oppose sanctuary policies   —    including 71 % of Democrats and 65 % of Latinos . Americans are tired of identity politics , tired of releasing criminal aliens back into the community , and tired of excuses by politicians who put political correctness ahead of public safety .
