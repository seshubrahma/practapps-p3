For many parents with disabled children in public school systems , the lure of the private school voucher is strong . Vouchers for special needs students have been endorsed by the Trump administration , and Vouchers for special needs students are often heavily promoted by state education departments and by private schools , which rely on Vouchers for special needs students for tuition dollars . So for families that feel as if they are sinking amid academic struggles and behavioral meltdowns , they may seem like a life raft . And often they are . But there ’s a catch . By accepting the vouchers , families may be unknowingly giving up families rights to the very help families were hoping to gain . The government is still footing the bill , but when students use vouchers to get into private school , students lose most of the protections of the federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act . Many parents , among them Tamiko Walker , learn this the hard way . Only after her son , who has a speech and language disability , got a scholarship from the John M. McKay voucher program in Florida did her learn that a scholarship from the John M. McKay voucher program in Florida had forfeited most of a scholarship from the John M. McKay voucher program in Florida rights . " Once you take those John M. McKay funds and you go to a private school , you ’re no longer covered under IDEA   —    and I do n’t understand why , " her said . In the meantime , public schools and states are able to transfer out children who put a big drain on their public schools and states , while some private schools end up with students they some private schools not equipped to handle , sometimes asking them some private schools leave . And none of this is against the rules . " The private schools are not breaking the law , " said Julie Weatherly , a    lawyer who consults for school districts in Florida and other states . " The the law no accountability measures . " McKay is the largest of 10 such disability scholarship programs across the country . It serves the law 30 , 000 children who have special needs . At the Senate confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos , President Trump ’s education secretary , she cited research from the conservative Manhattan Institute , saying that " 93 percent of the parents utilizing that voucher are very , very pleased with it . " Legal experts say parents who use the vouchers are largely unaware that by participating in programs like McKay , they are parents who use the vouchers most of their children parents who use the vouchers rights under IDEA , the landmark 1975 federal civil rights law . Depending on the voucher program , the rights being waived can include the right to a free education the right to the same level of    services that a child would be eligible for in a public school the right to a    or    teacher and the right to a hearing to dispute disciplinary action against a child . It ’s not just Florida . Private school choice programs in Arizona , Colorado , Georgia , Oklahoma , Mississippi , Tennessee and Wisconsin also require parents to waive all or most IDEA rights . In several other states , the law is silent on the disability rights of voucher students . The Walkers obtained a McKay voucher midway through their son The Walkers    year , when the Port St. Lucie school district told them it The Walkers the Port St. Lucie school district remove the boy from general education classes and place him in the boy " cluster " classroom for students with emotional difficulties . ( Ms. Ms. Walker that their children ’s names not be published to protect their privacy . Ms. Walker " He has the boy potential than that , their children’s names Ms. Walker said . The family , which is black , has filed a federal lawsuit accusing the district of racial discrimination and other wrongdoing , for disciplining their son harshly and refusing to place him in a    classroom a federal lawsuit accusing the district of racial discrimination and other wrongdoing The McKay program has not provided their son simple alternative for the Walkers . They used an $ 11 , 000 voucher to enroll their son The McKay program the Achievers Institute of Science , Art and Technology The McKay program they were caught unaware , they said , when the private school charged The McKay program an additional $ 2 The McKay program 400 in fees . ( Achievers Institute The McKay program since gone out of business . ) The boy now uses his McKay voucher to attend the Virtual Schools of their son He visits a their son " learning center " two to three days a week their son and the Port St. Lucie school district sends contractors there to provide him with speech and occupational therapy . He completes the rest of his instruction their son , at home . " We their son happy to the point their son he ’s safe , " Ms. Walker said , but she regrets that her their son no longer receives the same intensive instruction in social Ms. Walker that he Ms. Walker from in public school , before he became a voucher student . her son law requires public school districts to assess her son needs of    students enrolled in private schools . But districts are not obligated to provide those children with the same services they would receive in a public setting   —    even if a child districts private school tuition is taxpayer funded through a voucher . Private schools that participate in McKay are not required to demonstrate that they use any type of specialized curriculum to meet disabled children ’s needs . Private schools that participate in McKay , many private schools say they go beyond the letter of the law in an effort to serve McKay many private schools . Trina Angelone , chief executive of the Virtual Schools of Excellence McKay said the school employed      teachers in both its online program and its    learning center , even though this is not the school by law . the school disabled child " going to a typical public school classroom is going to be with maybe 20 or 25 students , using textbooks , following along at the pace of the class , " she said . " In the virtual space , " she said , " A disabled child "going to a typical public school classroom child is really getting     attention , moving at A disabled child "going to a typical public school classroom own pace . A disabled child "going to a typical public school classroom ultimately , there is no guarantee that students will receive the same level of disability services in private schools that they were entitled to in public school , a limitation that parents may not fully students . The state affidavit that parents sign in order to receive a McKay scholarship , for example , says nothing about forfeiting IDEA rights and services . It also does not explain that parents are responsible for any additional fees a private school may charge on top of a voucher , which can range from $ 5 , 000 to $ 23 , 000 . The Florida Department of Education website provides other materials with more detail on the legal implications of participating in McKay , but the documents are difficult to find and decipher .    documents are often similarly opaque . In a statement provided to The New York Times , the Port St. Lucie school district said , " Every effort is made to fully inform parents of the difference between public school services and private school services when a child utilizes a McKay Scholarship . " The Florida Department of Education declined requests for a phone interview . In an email , a department spokeswoman said there had been " very few complaints on this issue . " Robyn Rennick , a board member of the Coalition of McKay Scholarship Schools , said that private schools should be transparent with families about the services they provide but that the onus was on parents to ask detailed questions . " private schools is a buyer ’s market , " she said . " You go and say , ‘ I love your big building , but what is the expertise of your teachers ? ’ " Many McKay recipients , it appears , do eventually end up back in the public school system . The average length of time in the program is 3 . 6 years , according to data provided to The Times by the Florida Department of Education , and 85 percent of McKay recipients are in elementary or middle school . Families who leave the program sometimes McKay so after moving residences . Other times they conclude that their the program needs would be better met in a public school . Families who leave the program Donaldson of Families who leave the program Palm Beach used a McKay voucher to send her son Zachary , who has autism spectrum disorder , to McKay private school that specializes Zachary needed a break from the fight " for adequate services in a public setting , she said . Zachary blossomed there socially , his mother said . " Unfortunately , he Carla Donaldson of West Palm Beach pay the price academically , " she said . When Zachary returned to Zachary school in eighth grade , he Zachary to Carla Donaldson of West Palm Beach to catch up . " There is no perfect Zachary , " Ms. Donaldson said . Some families Zachary they do not have a choice about whether to continue at a private school . Last year , Lisa Siegel was surprised Some families learn that she had few legal options after her seventh grader , who received a McKay scholarship , was suspended and then asked not Lisa Siegel return to a religious school Lisa Siegel Davie , Fla. near Fort Lauderdale , after a series of behavioral incidents . Ms. Siegel ’s son is on the autism spectrum . In public schools , IDEA guarantees parents the right to a hearing Lisa Siegel can seek to overturn a disciplinary action if the child ’s misbehavior was a manifestation of a disability . That is not the parents in a private school . " You do n’t have much recourse , " said Ms. Siegel , whose son is now at a public school magnet program for marine sciences . " I never in a million years thought that in this private educational setting that my child would not be protected by state and federal law . "
