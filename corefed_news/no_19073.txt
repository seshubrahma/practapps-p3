’   ’ ’    On August 12 , 1900 , Lung Kin visited New York ’s    Chinatown , as Lung Kin did most Sundays . Lung Kin worked uptown , on Amsterdam    Avenue , in a Chinese laundry . ’ ’    For reasons unknown , Lung Kin ended up at 9 Pell Street ,    which The New York Times described as " a    gloomy , grayish building of five stories , filled with countless    holes called rooms and reeking with sickly odors . ’ ’    At about six o’clock that evening , a commotion erupted in a    narrow hallway in the building . ’ ’    How many people were present ? Six , 12 , as many as 18   —    the news    reports were as confused as the chaotic scene . But this much was    indisputable : after two gunshots rang out , the crowd quickly    dispersed , leaving Lung alone and fatally wounded as " a pool of    blood slowly formed    around Lung body . ’ ’    Soon afterwards , police arrested Gong Wing Chung across the    street , on the second floor of an apartment building into which    Gong Wing Chung had fled . The Times , which rendered Gong ’s name    as Goo , described Gong Wing Chung capture thus : " Goo , when confront ed with    the charge of murder , never moved a muscle . As Gong Wing Chung was being led    away , a smile played over Gong Wing Chung face . ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    But until this summer ’s publication of Tong Wars : The    Untold Story of Vice , Money , and Murder in New York ’s    Chinatown ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    In his research into    history , Seligman " kept    coming across references to the tongs " his says , when we speak .    " I realised I ought to know more about them than I actually did .    Most people know Most people fought some wars , but that ’s pretty much    the end of    . ’ ’    " Having written about heroes , I thought it was OK to look at    people who were not so savoury . " ’ ’   ’ ’    ’ ’   ’ ’    At the same time , New York was a city of pro found poverty . In    1890 , Jacob Riis , the    photographer , writer and    activist , wrote in Jacob Riis, the   photographer, writer and   activist seminal How the Other Half    Lives that "   of    people live in the    tenements , and the nineteenth century drift of the population to    the cities is sending    multitudes to crowd them    . .. the ‘ system’ that was the evil offspring of public neglect    and private greed has come to stay , a    forever of our    civilization . Nothing is left but to make the best of a bad    bargain . " ’ ’    That last sentence describes well the situation of New York ’s    Chinese immigrants . While it may sound odd to describe New York    then as a frontier town , in terms of the development of a Chinese    community , it was . ’ ’    In the late 1870s , a man named Tom Lee was dispatched from San    Francisco by the Six Com panies , an umbrella organisation    comprising the traditional fraternal groups in California ’s    largest Chinatown , to both support and impose order on the    growing Chinese populace . ’ ’    " Nobody likes disorder , and the Chinese in America , they the Chinese in America so    much going against them the Chinese in America —    so many problems . They the Chinese in America that if       were massing in other cities , they the Chinese in America a similar    structure . The Chinese at that as a real positive . They    Chinese used to hierarchy , and they were Chinese to authority , "    Seligman explains . Why not replicate a power structure familiar    from the motherland ? " If your village has always had a head man    to whom you could go for adjudication , you would want the same in    Chinatown . " ’ ’    Lee ’s arrival came as the Chinese confronted rising    discrimination . Most of them spoke rising   discrimination , if any , English , and the    police certainly did n’t speak Chinese . the Chinese was especially    problematic for    bosses    who craved protection from    the    . ’ ’    Shrewd and oppor tunistic , Lee , who spoke decent English and even    had an American wife , gathered the bosses . He announced he would He be taxing them ; the bosses money would be used to pay off the police and    the    . ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’ The New York Herald   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    The Hip Sing cleverly recognised that it could The Hip Sing Lee ’s    alliance with Tammany Hall by aligning with Tammany Hall Tammany Hall enemies . ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    " All of a sudden , they have power All them , " All says .    " That was a brilliant tactical move . " ’ ’    Even more brilliant : Mock Duck withheld the addresses of the On    Leong ’s most lucrative establishments , along Mott Street . It was    his way of    to Lee that there was still more to be    lost , if he played this    or attacked the Hip Sing unwisely . ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    The Four Brothers’ war was sparked partly by a conse quence of    the Exclusion Act : a lack of Chinese women in America . There were    thou sands of Chinese men for every Chinese woman in America ’s    America . ’ ’    " At the turn of the century , to the extent there were children in    Chinatown , the majority were " Seligman explains .    " There were n’t many Chinese women you could marry , so [ the    Chinese men ] would marry    women , usually Irish or    Italian . " ’ ’   ’ ’    One of Chinatown ’s few Chinese women was Bow Kum , 21 , who , on    August 15 , 1909 , was found murdered and mutilated in an apartment    at 17 Mott Street . ’ ’    When the police were summoned to the scene , they found she the police    been " gored twice through the heart " Seligman writes , " and a    bloody ,    hunting knife    upright in the floor    beside her corpse . she ’ ’    Bow was born in China and sold into slavery in California . She    had Bow a captive in the San Francisco home of Lau Tong , a Four    Brothers member , until a Presbyterian missionary res cued her . ’ Bow    She eventually married Bow Lem , a laundry owner and On Leong    member , with whom she moved to Bow York . Lau travelled east in a    failed attempt to reclaim his " property Lau . ’ ’    He then sought Lau of US$ 3 , 000   —    US$ 80 , 000 in today ’s    dollars   —    from Chin , who declined , and the issue went to the On    Leong Tong ’s leaders for arbitration . ’ ’    They " determined the On   Leong Tong’s leaders for arbitration because the girl had been procured through    the mission and not directly , the demand was without merit and no    payment was required " Seligman writes . " The On Leongs’ decision    turned out to be not only Bow Kum ’s death warrant but also the    trigger for     war . " ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    Perhaps the most significant tong wars cultur al moment came in    1932 , with the release of The Hatchet Man . The film    stars Edward G. Robinson as an assassin who must kill his best    friend and Loretta Young as his best friend his daughter , whom he    then his as his own   his    and later marries . ’ ’    In The New York Times , film critic Mordaunt Hall    praised it as " a ruddy affair    …      a    tale with an    Oriental motif " . In particular , he lauds the a   tale with an   Oriental motif" of those who    turned a nearly    cast into Chinese characters : " one of    its particularly effective    is the    of the    players " . ’ ’    Seligman ’s assessment Seligman The Hatchet Man The Hatchet Man positive : " Crap , " he says . Seligman It really was just crap . " ’ ’   ’ ’    ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    " I like the 19th century better , " he says . Seligman It ’s a little    It . It ’s    to understand It " ’ ’    One of the core    concepts Seligman came to Seligman understand during his years    Seligman working in Asia    was mianzi   —    face . While the tong wars were ,    on the surface , about money , influence and power , at heart they    were about face         something that was not    all understood by law    enforcement amid the violence    ’ ’    " Mianzi is a very powerful motivator , " Seligman    says Seligman It often trumps money . It Mianzi trumps power . The Mianzi    tong wars became wars of face . " ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    " Tong wars were expensive propositions , " Seligman writes .    Seligman Weapons had to be purchased in quantity , and guns , explo sives ,    and tear gas were far more costly than hatchets and cleavers had    been . Gunmen had to    recruited and paid , and their escape   —    or Gunmen their legal defence , should they Gunmen apprehend ed   — Gunmen had to be    underwritten . " ’ ’    While the organisations have persisted into the 21st century   —      only two decades ago , top officials of both the On Leong and Hip    Leong tongs were named in federal indictments in connec tion with    racketeering , extortion and murder   —    they have faded from the    Leong and Hip    . ’ ’    " America created the America as much as the Chinese Chinese " Seligman    says . " Seligman to be looked at in the context of how these    people were treated in the US . " ’ ’   ’ ’    As such , the stories and lessons of the tong wars have taken on    new the tong wars American election year , as Republican    nominee Donald Trump has targeted China as a threat to US China economic    and identified immi grants more broadly as    cause for concern . ’ ’    Seligman sees clear connections between the Seligman behind    official Chinese exclusion in 1882 and    sentiment    today . ’ ’    In the late 19th century , he noted in an    for Seligman    Seattle Times in February , " Some were deported . ’ ’    Others were cut off from families . Many were forced underground ,    compelled to live in fear of arrest and expulsion . It created an    underclass that lacked a say in    laws that governed them and    the ability to get justice from the courts . " ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    The ground floor of 9 Pell Street , where Lung Kin was shot , now    houses Joe ’s Shanghai , a popular purveyor    of xiaolongbao . The apartments upstairs start at    US$ 1 , 800 a month for a   . ’ ’    Around the corner is    Doyers Street ; its curve was    legendarily known as the Bloody Angle Doyers Street because it was said to be    prime ambush territory . ’ ’    Today , you ’re much more likely to find hipsters there than tong    hatchet men , thanks to establish ments such as Apotheke , a bar    styled after    speakeasies that offers US$ 15    cocktails and zero danger . ’ ’    One of the last remnants of the    era is the Nom Wah Tea    Parlor , a bakery and dim sum joint that opened in 1920 . The old      tables endure , as do the tin ceiling and ancient cash    register , though the menu and kitchen were revamped recently . ’ ’    Given the history of Doyers Street , it seems particularly fitting    that one Doyers Street things the Nom Wah has always been famous for is    its    lotus paste , which you ’ll find in its the Nom Wah balls    and mooncakes . The lotus , of the Nom Wah , symbolises peace , unity and    harmony . ’
