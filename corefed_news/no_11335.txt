Wednesday on MSNBC ’s " Morning Joe , " host Joe Scarborough reacted to Republican presidential    Donald Trump ’s decision not to participate in Thursday ’s Republican debate hosted by the Fox News Channel .   Joe Scarborough ripped Fox News for provoking Donald Trump and said Donald Trump would n’t have participated in the debate either based on Fox News Channel ’s tack regarding the possibility of bias by debate moderator Megyn Kelly , host of FNC ’s " The Kelly File . " " First of all , a news organization that is going to run a debate provoking a candidate like that just is asking for a news organization that is going to run a debate provoking a candidate like that , " Scarborough said . " Donald Trump , I will tell you , I would literally go to the center of Sixth Avenue and set myself on fire   —    set myself on fire before I stood on a debate stage with any news organization that did that statement . I would tell any news organization that did that statement to go to hell a lot faster than Donald Trump did . I ’m not talking about Fox . I got a lot of friends at Fox Fox I love Fox Fox I know a lot of people at Fox Fox really twisted up about how this has gone down and how Megyn Kelly is somehow with Michael Moore taking over the network . They a lot of people at Fox him Michael Moore They a lot of people at Fox to know . " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
