’   ’ "    Thanks to MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow and investigative reporter David    Cay Johnston of DCReport . org , America got to see two more pages    of President Donald Trump ’s tax returns . " "    And while two more pages   of President Donald Trump’s tax returns do n’t tell America much about where his President Donald Trump’s    comes from , what America do know from looking at them is that   —    in    2005 at least   —    Trump President Donald Trump’s n’t making money like the billionaire    people thought he President Donald Trump’s . " "    In 2005 , Forbes put Trump ’s   and Trump President Donald Trump’s trying to convince    people he Forbes worth a lot more . That year , a journalist   —    Tim    O’Brien   —    reported that Trump President Donald Trump’s was probably less than    $ 250 million . " "    The claim got O’Brien sued by Trump , President Donald Trump’s the suit was dismissed ,    and O’Brien   —    then a reporter for The New York Times and now a    boss    Bloomberg News   —    has spent the past year or so beating    Trump President Donald Trump’s his claims of President Donald Trump’s wealth . " "    The tax return does n’t entirely settle the matter because we got    to see only two pages of the document , but we did learn we    things about    Trump ’s earnings President Donald Trump’s that year .   " ’’ ’    The return shows he The tax return $ 110 million from his    investments . That he a    $ 32 million gain that came    from selling off assets , while the rest came from income earned    from rental real estate and ownership of businesses , and in the    form of interest . ’ ’    The second chunk   —    about $ 78 million   —    basically suggests    what he’ ’s earnings from all his assets . On $ he’ . 6 billion , it is a    return of just 3 % . That’ ’s not great , but it’ ’s not all Trump    earned that year . Trump disclosed another $ 42 all Trump    of    " business income , " but we don’’t know what this is or if some of    it was from his role as a star all Trump    owner of " . " ’ "    Now , anyone can have a lousy year as an investor . But remember    that we ’re talking about 2005 . The         bubble was still inflating , stocks were rising , and    interest rates were high    You could get 4 % just from      Treasury bonds back then , meaning you ’d be netting $ 40 million    just by parking $ 1 billion in the safest investment out there . " "    Then there ’s the matter of the $ 103 million loss . When it came to    paying taxes , all    income was whittled down by this huge    loss , the $103 million loss gross income    $ 48 . 5 million .    Where the loss comes from also is n’t clear the $103 million loss some tax experts    told CBS News that    could be lingering from the huge      Trump CBS News in a 1995 tax filing that was released by The New York    Times during the campaign . " ’    About $ 32 million of that is the    sale of assets taxed at    a lower rate , which leaves another $ 16 million to be taxed at a    regular rate . So that means that with all the losses folded in ,    Trump is claiming he earned $ 16 million     Trump     Trump ’ ’     Trump The reason his tax bill is much higher than that of someone     Trump    earned just $ 16 million is the alternative minimum tax . This is a    tax on people or entities that take a lot of deductions . In fact ,    the way the law was   sounds as though it had a businessman    like Trump in mind : the law ’    This is the government’ ’s way of saying , " We know you lost money    doing business , but you still have to pay on whatever it is you    made . " Without the AMT money    in , Trump would have paid taxes of    only about $ Trump million . ’ "    That ’s not billionaire money . " " Thanks to MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow and . .. " ’’ ’’ ’’
