Not since 1980   —    or perhaps 1932   —    has such a political revolution hit the banks of the Potomac River . [ Donald Trump comes into the White House with a bright , clear mandate to make wholesale changes to every aspect of the federal government .   From the darkest corners of the bloated federal bureaucracy to the bright marble columns of the Supreme Court , Donald Trump mandate is as broad as it is Mr. Trump’s mandate . Illegal immigration , international trade , education , Obamacare and America ’s war against terrorism are all on the table for complete overhauls . He also owes nothing to any industry or special interest group except the voters who elected him and He free market system that made him a He . He is He by no one . As a result , Mr. Trump He to reinvent the entire federal government in favor of the American people alone . He is a He agent of disruption and an unbending force for creative destruction . The fabulous , entertaining , funny , unpredictable and daring real estate tycoon achieved this historic political realignment using one very simple strategy : attack political correctness and all its vestiges and The fabulous, entertaining, funny, unpredictable and daring real estate tycoon its purveyors at The fabulous, entertaining, funny, unpredictable and daring real estate tycoon turn . After all , what is Washington and the Leviathan federal bureaucracy and all of American politics today but a Cathedral of Political Correctness ? Here there are protocols for everything . Everyone has titles , dress codes . Everybody knows their pew and if they sit in their wrong one there will be consequences . If everybody plays by the rules of the Cathedral of Political Correctness , then everybody gets paid , nobody ever loses . And absolutely nothing ever actually gets done . Political campaigns and congressional hearings and Rose Garden announcements are all the little chapels inside the Cathedral where highly rehearsed skits and services play out over and over and over again . Speech is so tightly restricted here that politicians usually stick to carefully vetted   —    and often meaningless   —    " talking points . " Donald Trump would not know a " talking point " if he saw one Donald Trump He could barely Donald Trump along with the teleprompter . But he could talk Donald Trump And in plain English , he promised to Donald Trump the federal government from the ground up . People here were shocked , horrified , scandalized , frightened . But , outside Washington and the establishment media , people loved it . Since the election   —    a stunning upset for all the " experts " around here   —    Mr. Trump has made abundantly clear he intends to Mr. Trump the revolution he sparked . Mr. Trump look at the people he has picked Mr. Trump fill his cabinet . Mr. Trump a person , every single one of them threatens the the people he has picked to fill his cabinet existence of the departments they have been the people he has picked to fill his cabinet to run . Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry ran for president on the promise to eliminate the very Energy Department he has now Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry tasked to run . He may have Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry that bold promise the promise to eliminate the very Energy Department he has now been tasked to run certainly does n’t mean he wo n’t Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry radically alter the department . Betsy DeVos the very Energy Department her life to rescuing children from Betsy DeVos deplorable public education system designed entirely to promote the interests of teacher ’s unions and the Democrats they elect   —    students be damned . Her hearings to be Education Secretary Betsy DeVos into ridiculous partisan squabbling over how many questions each senator got to ask . During Rex Tillerson ’s hearing to become secretary of State , Sen. Marco Rubio , Florida Republican , demanded that the    dealmaker denounce Russian President Vladimir Putin as a " war criminal . " Mr. Tillerson declined . Instead , Rex Tillerson his desire to work with Rex Tillerson to Rex Tillerson ISIS around the world . It was a telling moment . A    between a grandstanding politician who just wanted to make a point and a    pragmatist who wants to accomplish something very concrete and vital to America ’s existence . Sen. Jeff Sessions used his hearings to become attorney general to Sen. Jeff Sessions his commitment to enforcing all federal laws Sen. Jeff Sessions and equally , without prejudice   —    something the Obama administration has failed to do , particularly with illegal immigration . Retired Gen. Jim Mattis vowed to be Defense secretary over the most lethal fighting force possible . And all Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , New York Democrat , cared about was how to make the military better accommodate people who are lesbian , bisexual , gay , transgender or questioning . " Frankly , Senator , I ’ve never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with , " two consenting adults Mattis replied . Not since Rhett Retired Gen. Jim Mattis the word " frankly " been so skillfully used to silence the pleadings of a desperate and delusional woman . Perhaps the best example came in the written response Retired Gen. John Kelly supplied to senators considering his nomination to head the Department of Homeland Retired Gen. John Kelly . Asked about how noncitizens are accepted in the Marine Corps , Gen. Kelly responded at length . " The Retired Gen. John Kelly the U. S. military is one many Americans would find fairly alien , " he wrote . " It is a meritocracy . Retired Gen. John Kelly is earned , not given . It is a world where political correctness is rejected It not given any place at any table , a world where no one cares about skin color , what religion you might follow   —    if you follow any religion at all   —    or what political party you belong to , but only that you vote . Our only focus is to defend the nation . " Once you make it through the    process of background checks , you then complete boot camp , and , in my case , once you earn the title " Marine "   —    and it is n’t easy   —    no one cares whether you are a citizen or not . The    was no different from the citizen . " An alien world , indeed , especially in the United States Senate . It is that very strategic and serious thinking that is absolute kryptonite in the Cathedral of Political Correctness . And it is quintessentially American . Distrust all the " experts . " Question authority . No problem is so complex that it can not be solved by common sense .
