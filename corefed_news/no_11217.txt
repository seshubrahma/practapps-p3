Sunday , on CNN ’s " State of the Union With Jake Tapper , " Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that the foreign policy Republican    Donald Trump detailed in an address last week was " disturbing . "   Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said , " I certainly read about the foreign policy Republican   Donald Trump detailed in an address last week , and I think the foreign policy Republican   Donald Trump detailed in an address last week ’s quite concerning . Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton talk about pulling out of NATO , Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton talk about letting other countries have nuclear weapons , which runs counter to 70 years of bipartisan national security policy , Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton idea that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has a ‘ secret plan’ to get rid of ISIS that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ’s not going to tell anybody . I found it disturbing . Because   —    I , as a senator from New York for eight years , as secretary of state for four years , I know that the stakes are high , that we face some real challenges and dangers in the world . And I do n’t think loose talks about loose nukes , I do n’t think turning our back on our strongest allies , I do n’t think pretending you have some sort of secret plan is a very smart way to go forward in leading the world , which is what we our do .
