Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is surging in battleground states Iowa and Virginia in newly released polls , consistent with the national trend reported this week by    and other major polling operations . [ A handful of swing states —   experts always mention at least five , and no more than eleven —   will determine the winner of the presidential race , mainly concentrated in the Midwest ,    and Southwest .   Polling numbers from two of those states seem to fit a larger trend over the past two weeks of improving chances for Donald Trump to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . An Emerson poll in Iowa has Donald Trump up five points over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ,    in a sample of 600 likely voters . This brought the RealClearPolitics average of recent polls in the Hawkeye State to a + 1 advantage for Donald Trump , for the first time since the candidates held the candidates respective conventions in   . Emerson also polled in Virginia and found Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with only a    lead over Donald Trump , in a sample of 800 likely voters . The resulting RealClearPolitics average of + 7 . 7 for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is a significant departure from recent polls showing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with a    advantage in the Old Dominion , which Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has enjoyed since picking Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine ( who is also the state ’s former governor ) as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton running mate . The Iowa poll was conducted Aug.   . 1 with a margin of error of 3 . 9 percent , and the Virginia poll was conducted Aug.   . 1 with a margin of 3 . 4 percent . These 4 percent the first Emerson polls in those two battleground states in this election cycle . Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News .
