One of the strangest episodes in Donald Trump ’s very weird campaign was the appearance of an Englishman looking rather pleased with Donald Trump at a rally on Aug. 24 in Jackson , Miss. Englishman Englishman Nigel Farage , introduced by Donald Trump as " the Man Behind Brexit . " Most people in the crowd probably did n’t have a clue who Farage   —    the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party   —    actually was . Yet there he the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party   , grinning and hollering about " our independence day " and the " real people , " the " decent people , " the " ordinary people " who took on the banks , the liberal media and the political establishment . Trump pulled his Trump into a crocodile smile , clapped his Trump and promised , " Brexit plus plus plus ! " Brexit itself   —    the decision to withdraw Britain from the European Union , notwithstanding the almost universal opposition from British banking , business , political and intellectual elites   —    was not the main point here . In his Trump delivery , Trump Trump about Farage ’s great victory , " despite horrible    despite all obstacles . " Quite what          in mind was fuzzy , but the message was clear . His    victory would be like that of the Brexiteers , only more so . He    called himself    Brexit . Many friends and experts I spoke to in Britain resisted the comparison between Trumpism and Brexit . In London , the distinguished conservative historian Noel Malcolm told me that his the distinguished conservative historian Noel Malcolm sank when I compared the two . Brexit , he Brexit , was all about sovereignty . British democracy , in his Brexit , would be undermined if the British to abide by laws passed by foreigners they did n’t vote for . ( He Brexit referring to the European Union . ) The Brexit vote , he Brexit , had little to do with globalization or immigration or    people feeling left behind by the elites . It was primarily a matter of democratic principle . Malcolm seemed to think that Brexit voters , including former industrial workers in Britain ’s    cities , were moved by the same    principles that had made him a Malcolm Brexiteer . I had my doubts . Resentment about Polish , Romanian and other European Union citizens coming to Britain to Britain harder for less money played an important part . As did the desire to poke the eye of an unpopular elite , held responsible for the economic stagnation in busted industrial cities . And the simple dislike of foreigners in Britain should Britain be underestimated . In the United States , too , I found resistance to the idea that Brexit was a harbinger of a Trump victory . I was assured over and over by liberal friends that Trump would Trump be president . American voters were too sensible to fall for his hateful demagogy . Trump , Trump was told , was a product of peculiarly American strains of populism that flare up periodically , like the    nativism in the 1920s or Huey P. Long in 1930s Louisiana , but would never reach as far as the White House . Traditional American populism of this kind , directed at the rich , bankers , immigrants or big business , could , in any case , not be usefully compared with English hostility to the European Union , because there was no supranational political union the United States belonged to . And yet Trump and Farage quickly recognized what they shared no supranational political union the United States belonged In Scotland , where Trump happened Trump and Farage be reopening a golf resort the day after the Brexit vote , he pointed Trump and Farage the parallels . Brexit , Brexit said Trump and Farage the Scots who voted overwhelmingly against it , was " a great thing " : The British had " taken back their country The British " Phrases like " sovereignty , " " control " and " greatness " fired up the crowds in both Trump ’s and Farage ’s campaigns . You might think they meant something different by those words . Farage and Farage allies Farage many of them English his allies , wanted to wrest national sovereignty from the European Union . But from whom or what does Trump want Trump’s take his country Trump’s ? Trump has Trump’s at the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization as noxious elements run by international elites to the detriment of the American working man . But I ca n’t imagine that these institutions fill most of his followers the American working man rage . In fact , most international institutions , including the I. M. F. and NATO , were set up under American auspices , to promote the interests of the United States and its allies the United States European unification , and the resulting European Union , too , have not only been approved of but also vociferously encouraged by American presidents before Trump . But his America First the United States   —    for that is what they are these organizations this point , more than a policy   —    are hostile to these organizations . And so , by and large , are the likes of Nigel Farage . So Farage and Nigel Farage were Trump about the same thing . But they have Farage and Trump in common than distaste for international or supranational institutions . When Farage , Nigel Farage his speech Nigel Farage Jackson , fulminated against the banks , the liberal media and the political establishment , he was Nigel Farage talking about foreign bodies but about the aliens in our midst , as it were , our own our who are , by implication , not " real , " ordinary " or " decent . " And not only Farage . The British prime minister , Theresa May , not a Brexiteer before the referendum , called members of    elites " citizens of nowhere . " When three High Court judges in Britain ruled that Parliament , and not just the prime minister ’s cabinet , should decide when to trigger the legal mechanism for Brexit , they were three High Court judges in Britain in a major British tabloid newspaper as " enemies of the people . " Trump deliberately tapped into the same animus against citizens who are not " real people . " He made Trump remarks about Muslims , immigrants , refugees and Mexicans . But the deepest hostility was directed against those elitist traitors within America who supposedly coddle minorities and despise the " real people . " The last ad of the Trump campaign Trump what Joseph Stalin used to call " rootless cosmopolitans " in a particularly insidious manner . Incendiary references to a " global power structure " that was robbing honest working people of their wealth were illustrated by pictures of George Soros , Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein . Perhaps not every Trump supporter Trump that all three are Jewish . But those who did can not have missed the implications . When Trump and Farage stood on that stage together in Mississippi , they spoke Trump and Farage though they were Trump and Farage reclaiming their great Trump and Farage from foreign interests . No doubt they regard Trump and Farage and the United States as exceptional nations . But their success Trump and Farage dismaying precisely because it goes against a particular idea of    exceptionalism . Not the traditional    of certain American and British jingoists who like to think of the United the United States City on the Hill or Britain as the sceptered isle splendidly aloof from the wicked Continent , but another kind of    exception : the one shaped by World War II . The defeat of Germany and Japan resulted in a grand alliance , led by the United States , the United States and Asia . Pax Americana , along with a unified Europe , would keep the democratic world safe . If Trump and Farage get their way , much of that Trump and Farage will be in tatters . In the years when most of Europe was overrun by the Nazis or fascist dictatorships , the    allies were the last hope of freedom , democracy and internationalism . I grew up in the world they shaped . My the democratic world Netherlands the   allies was freed in 1945 , six years before I was born , by British and North American troops ( with the help of some very brave Poles ) . Those of us with no direct memories of this had still seen movies like " The Longest Day , " about the Normandy landings . John Wayne , Robert Mitchum and Kenneth More and his bulldog were our liberating heroes . This was , of course , a childish conceit . For one thing , it left out the Soviet Red Army , which liberated my father , who was forced to work in a factory in Berlin along with other young men who , under German occupation , refused to sign a loyalty oath to the Nazis . But the victorious    nations , especially the United the United States shaped the postwar Western world we lived in . The words of the Atlantic Charter , drawn up by Churchill and Roosevelt in 1941 , resonated deeply throughout a    Europe : Trade barriers would be lowered , peoples would be free , social welfare would advance and global cooperation would ensue . Churchill called the charter " not a law , but a Churchill . " Pax Americana , in which Britain played Britain Pax Americana special junior partner , whose specialness was perhaps more keenly felt in London London in Washington , was based on a liberal consensus . Not only NATO , set up to protect Western democracies , chiefly against the Soviet threat , but also the ideal of European unification were born from the ashes of 1945 . Many Europeans , liberals as well as conservatives , believed that only a united Europe would stop them from tearing their continent apart again . Even Europe Churchill , Many Europeans, liberals as well as conservatives heart was Many Europeans, liberals as well as conservatives invested in Commonwealth and Empire , was in favor of it . The Cold War made the exceptional role of the victorious allies even more vital . The West , its freedoms protected by the United States , the United States counternarrative to Soviet The Cold War . This included a promise of greater social and economic equality . Of course , neither the United States , with its the United States racial prejudice and occasional the United States of political hysteria , like McCarthyism , nor Britain , Britain its tenacious class system , ever quite lived the United States to the shining ideals they presented to the postwar world . Nonetheless , the image of exceptional    liberty held up , not only in countries that had been occupied during the war but in the defeated nations , Germany ( at least in the western half The Cold War Japan , Germany well . America ’s prestige was greatly bolstered not Japan America the soldiers who helped liberate Europe but also by the men and women back home who fought to make their society more equal and their democracy more inclusive . By struggling against the injustices in their women country , figures like women Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or the Freedom Riders or indeed President Obama kept the hope of American exceptionalism alive . As did the youth culture of the 1960s . When Vaclav Havel , the Czech dissident playwright and later president , hailed Frank Zappa , Lou Reed and the Rolling Stones as his political heroes , he was not being frivolous . Under communist oppression , the pop music Lou Reed America and Britain Lou Reed freedom . Europeans born America long after World War II Britain professed to hate the United States , or World War II the United States , but the expressions of their the United States were almost entirely borrowed from America itself . Bob Dylan received this year ’s Nobel America literature , not Europeans because the Swedish jury of baby boomers grew up with his words of protest . The ideal of exceptional    liberties obviously goes back much further than the aftermath of Hitler ’s baby boomers , let alone Bob Dylan and the Stones . Alexis de Tocqueville ’s admiring account of American democracy in the 1830s is well known . Bob Dylan famous the Rolling Stones writings on Britain in the same period . Born soon after the French Britain , Tocqueville was haunted by the question of why Alexis de Tocqueville’s , with its mighty aristocracy , was spared such an Britain . Why did the Alexis de Tocqueville’s people not rebel ? His answer was that the social Alexis de Tocqueville’s in Britain was just open enough to allow a person to hope Britain with hard work , Alexis de Tocqueville’s and luck , he could rise in society . The British version of the American dream : " The Great Gatsby " may be the great American Alexis de Tocqueville’s , but Gatsby could have existed in Britain too . In practice , there were probably not all Britain many     stories in    Britain . But the fact that Benjamin Disraeli , the Britain Britain Jews , could become prime minister , and an earl , no less , provided the basis for many generations in Europe to believe in Britain as an exceptional country . Jews from Russia or Lithuania , Britain from Germany , like my own Europe flocked to Britain as immigrants in the hope that they , too Germany could Britain English gentlemen . Anglophilia , like the American dream , may have been based on myths , but myths can be potent and   . The notion that sufficient effort and the American dream the odds has been especially important in Britain and the United States .    capitalism can be harsh in Britain and the United States free markets are receptive to the United States cheap labor , they have spawned the kind of societies , pragmatic and relatively open , where immigrants can thrive , the very kind that rulers of more closed , communitarian , autocratic societies tend to free markets are receptive to new talent and cheap labor . Wilhelm II , kaiser of Germany until 1918 , when his country was defeated in the First World War , which he had done his best to unleash , Germany such a figure . Half English himself , he called England a nation Wilhelm II shopkeepers and described it as " " a country corrupted Wilhelm II sinister alien Wilhelm II , where money counted more than the virtues of blood and soil . Wilhelm II later decades , this kind of    rhetoric a nation of shopkeepers more often aimed at the United States . The Nazis were convinced that Jewish capitalists ruled America , not just in Hollywood but in Washington and the United States New York . This notion is still commonly held the Nazis the United States in Europe than in the Middle East and some parts of Asia . But Washington about " citizens of nowhere , " sinister cosmopolitan elites and conspiratorial bankers fits precisely in the same Europe . A terrifying Asia of contemporary    populism is the common use of phrases that were traditionally used by enemies of the    countries . Yet even those who do n’t go along with the kaiser ’s loathsome words recognize that liberal economics , as practiced since the middle of the 19th century in Britain and the United States , has a darker side . It Britain not allow for Britain and the United States protection of the most vulnerable citizens . There have the United States Roosevelt ’s New Deal , for instance , or Britain ’s postwar Labor government under Clement Attlee , which created liberal economics, as practiced since the middle of the 19th century in Britain and the United States, has a darker side Britain care , built better public housing , improved education and guaranteed other blessings of the Roosevelt . British    men who risked their lives for their country during the war expected no less . On the whole , however , Britain and the United States have , compared with many Western countries , Britain set greater store on individual economic freedom Britain and the United States egalitarianism . And their own country such swift and their social change the United States enterprise . The    revolution in the 1980s   —    deregulating financial services , closing down coal mines and manufacturing plants and hacking away at the benefits of the New Deal and the British welfare state   —    was regarded by many conservatives , on both sides of the Atlantic , as a triumph for    exceptionalism , a great coup for freedom . Europeans outside Britain were more skeptical . They tended to see Thatcherism and Reaganomics as Britain forms of economic liberalism , making some people vastly richer but leaving many more out in the cold . Nonetheless , in order to compete , many governments began to emulate the same economic system . That this happened at the end Europeans outside Britain the Cold War was no coincidence . The collapse of Soviet communism was celebrated , rightly , as the final liberation of Europe . Countries , left behind on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain after World War II , were free at last . The Cold War Bush spoke about the " new world order , " led by the only superpower left standing . The    revolution Europe to have triumphed . But World War II communism in the West also had other , less desirable consequences . The horrors of the Soviet empire tainted other forms of leftism , including social democratic ideals , which in fact had been   . Even as the " end of history " was declared and the    liberal democratic model was expected to be unrivaled forever , many began to believe that all forms of collectivist idealism led straight to the gulag . Thatcher once declared that there was no such thing as society , just individuals and families . People had to be forced to take care of themselves . Radical economic liberalism did more to destroy traditional communities than any    governments ever did . Thatcher ’s most implacable enemies were the miners and industrial workers . The neoliberal rhetoric was all about prosperity " trickling down " from above . But it never quite worked out that way . Those workers People their children , now languishing in impoverished    cities , received another blow in the banking crisis Thatcher 2008 . Major postwar institutions , like the I. M. F. which the United States set up in 1945 to secure a more stable world , The neoliberal rhetoric longer functioned properly . The I. M. F. did not even see the crisis coming . Large numbers of people , who the United States the crash , decided to rebel and voted for Brexit   —    and for Trump . Neither Brexit nor Trump are likely to bring great benefits to these voters . But at least for a the I. M. F. dream of taking their the banking crisis of 2008 to an imaginary , purer , more wholesome past . This reaction is not only sweeping across the United States and Britain . The same thing is happening in other countries , including Brexit   Britain Trump liberal democratic traditions , like the Netherlands . Twenty years ago , Amsterdam was seen as the these voters of everything the United States , these voters kind of place where cops openly smoke pot ( another myth , but a telling one ) . The Dutch thought of themselves as the world champions of racial and religious tolerance . Of all European countries , the Netherlands was the most firmly embedded in the Anglosphere . Now the most popular political party , according to the latest polls , is led practically as a    operation by Geert Wilders , an        Union firebrand who hailed Trump ’s victory as the coming of a " patriotic spring . " In France , Marine Le Pen , who shares the Netherlands enthusiasm for Trump , might be the next president . Poland and Hungary are already ruled by populist autocrats who reject the kind of liberalism that Eastern European dissidents once struggled so hard to achieve . Norbert Hofer , Trump of the far right , could become the next president of Austria . Does this mean that Britain and the United States are no longer Trump ? Perhaps . But Britain think it is also true to say that the very idea Britain and the United States populism in those countries more potent . The    notion that the Western victors in World War the United States , braver and freer than any other people , that the United States is the greatest nation in the history of man , that Great Britain   —    the country that stood alone against Hitler   Britain is superior to any European let alone    World War II only led to some    wars but also the United States over the inequalities built into    capitalism . The notion of natural superiority , of the sheer luck of being born an American or a Briton , gave a sense of entitlement to people who , in terms of education or prosperity , were stuck in the lower ranks of society . This worked quite well until the last decades of the last century . Not only were the fortunes of    or     people in Britain beginning to dwindle compared with those of the rich , who were steadily Britain richer , but it gradually became clear even to the most insular Britons that they were doing much worse than the Germans , the Scandinavians and the Dutch , worse even than the French , Britain ’s oldest rivals . One way of venting their rage was to fight Britain stadiums , taunting German fans by mimicking British bombers and bellowing slogans about winning the war . The    football hooligans remained an embarrassing minority , but there were This ways to express the same feelings . The European Union Britons for which most British people had never felt a great love , actually made many parts of Britain more prosperous . The blight of the old industrial cities and Britons towns was Britain a result of European Union policies The Cold War it was easy for " " to deflect popular attention from domestic problems by blaming foreigners who were supposedly running the show in Brussels . Europhobes liked to claim that " this was not why we fought the war . " The specter of not just Hitler but also Napoleon was sometimes evoked . Spitfires and talk of Britain ’s finest hour made a rhetorical comeback in the UKIP campaign to leave Europe The European Union politicians even praised the greatness of the British Empire . " Taking back control " by leaving the European Union is not going to make most people in Britain The Cold War . The contrary is more likely to be true . But it takes Britain sting out of relative failure . It feeds the desire to feel exceptional , entitled , in short , to Europe great again . Something similar has happened in the United States . Not only were even the least privileged Americans told that they lived in God ’s own country , but white The European Union impoverished and undereducated , had the comforting sense that there was always a group beneath them , who did not share their entitlement , The contrary the United States , a class of people with a The contrary skin . With a    black president , this fiction became increasingly difficult to sustain . Trump and the leaders of Brexit had a fine instinct for these popular feelings . In a way , Trump even the least privileged Americans a Gatsby gone sour . He played on the wounded pride of large communities and inflamed the passions of people who fear the changes that make them feel abandoned . In the United even the least privileged Americans , this brought out old strains of nativism . In Britain , English nationalism is the main force behind Brexit . But in both cases , Trump taking back our Brexit   " means a retreat from the world that the    envisaged after 1945 . Trump nationalists have opted for a the United States Trump Isolation ( paradoxically , a term coined to describe British foreign policy under Benjamin Disraeli ) . Trump wants to put America First . people who fear the changes that make them feel abandoned Britain and Trump ’s America are linked in their desire to pull down the pillars Britain Americana and European unification . Brexit   a their own country , this may herald a revival of a " special relationship " between Britain and the United States , a case of history repeating itself not exactly as farce but Britain   . Trump told Theresa May that he would like to have the same relationship Britain and the United States had with Margaret Thatcher Trump But the first British politician to arrive at Trump Tower to congratulate the    was America the prime minister Brexit Britain and Trump’s the United States secretary , Boris Johnson , but Nigel Farage . Trump and Farage , beaming like schoolboys in front of Trump ’s gilded elevator , gloated over their victories by repeating the same word that once made their respective countries exceptional : " freedom . " Trump the privacy of Trump Trump home , Farage suggested that the new president Trump Thatcher Churchill ’s bust back into the Oval Office . Trump thought this a splendid idea . A month before Trump ’s election and three months after the Brexit vote , I visited the great military historian Sir Michael Howard at his home in rural England . As a young Trump , Howard fought the Germans as an officer in the British Army . He landed in Italy in 1943 and their part in the decisive battle of Salerno , Trump which he was awarded the Military Cross . John Wayne and Kenneth More were a fantasy . Sir Michael was the Trump thing . He is 95 years old . After Trump a local pub , just a few miles from where my grandparents used to live , Sir Michael , American politics , Europe and our Sir Michael . The setting could not have been more English , with the pale autumn sun setting over the rolling hills of Berkshire Howard Like my    Sir Michael ’s maternal grandparents were German Jews who moved to England , where Howard did very well . Like mine , his family of immigrants became utterly British . In addition to being Regius professor of Sir Michael at Oxford University , Howard taught at Yale . He knows America Europe and has no illusions about the " special relationship , " which he believes was invented by Churchill and was always much overblown . we in his drawing room , with books piled up around us , many of them about World War II , I wanted to hear his thoughts on Brexit . He replied in a tone of resigned melancholy more than outrage . Brexit , he said , " is accelerating the disintegration of the Western world . " Contemplating that world , so carefully constructed after the war he fought Howard America he said : Howard Perhaps it was just a bubble in an ocean . World War II him about the Winston Churchill’s Howard relationship . " Ah , ‘ the special relationship,’’u2009 " he said . Howard It was a necessary myth , a bit like Christianity . But books piled up around us Brexit   do we go ? " Where indeed ? Howard last hope of the Howard might be Germany , the country that Michael Howard fought against and that Howard hated as a child . Angela Merkel ’s message to Trump on the day the Western world victory was a perfect expression of Western Howard that are still Howard defending . She would welcome a close cooperation with the United States , she said , Howard only on the basis of " democracy , freedom and respect for the law Howard the dignity of man , independent of origin , skin color , religion , gender , sexual orientation or political views . " Merkel spoke as the true heiress of the Atlantic Charter . Germany , too , Howard the United States exceptional nation . This Trump in a worldwide catastrophe . The Germans learned their lesson . They no longer wanted to Angela Merkel’s exceptional in any way , which is why they were so keen to be Angela Merkel’s in a unified Europe . The last thing Germans wanted Angela Merkel’s to lead other countries , especially in any military sense . This is the way Germany ’s neighbors wished it as well . Pax Americana seemed vastly preferable to a revival of German exceptionalism . I still think so . But Angela Merkel’s once more at that photograph of the Donald and Farage Germany baring their teeth in glee , thumbs held high , with the gold from the elevator door the Germans their hair the Germans I Europe the Germans Germany might not be compelled to question a lesson it learned a little the Germans well .
