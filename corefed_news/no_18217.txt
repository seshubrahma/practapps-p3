’   ’ ’    A     girl from Tucson slammed Arizona Republican senator    Jeff Flake during a town hall on Thursday , grilling Arizona Republican senator   Jeff Flake over    Arizona Republican senator   Jeff Flake support for a law that will give states the right to    deny Title X funds to    centers that also provide    abortions , like Planned Parenthood .   ’ "    President Trump signed the bill into law on Thursday , the same    day as Flake ’s town hall , and it was seen by many as a strike at    Planned Parenthood , which uses Title X money to provide    healthcare to millions of    women across the    country .   " ’    " Jeff Flake , my name is Deja Foxx and I’’m a     from    Tucson , " Foxx began . " I just want to state some facts . So , I’’m a    young woman , and you’’re a    man . I’’m a person of color ,    and you’’re white . I come from a background of poverty , and I    didn’’t always have parents to guide me through life . You come    from privilege , "    continued , amid shouts of support from the    crowd .   ’ ’    " So , I’’m wondering , as a Planned Parenthood patient and someone    who relies on Title X , who you are clearly not , why it’ ’s your    right to take away my right to choose Planned Parenthood and to    choose     birth control , to access that , " Foxx said . " So ,    if you can explain that to me , I would appreciate it . " ’ ’    Her comments drew raucous applause from the audience , and Flake    waited for the noise to die down before addressing Foxx Foxx   ’ ’    " I’’m glad to hear of my privileged childhood , " Flake Flake    , before    adding that he    one of 11 children and paid his    college    tuition .   ’ ’    " Privilege comes in many forms , " Foxx shot back .   ’ ’    Flake Flake    that and said , " I’’ve had a lot of advantages    that others haven’’t .   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’ ’ ’      ’ ’A     girl from Tucson slammed Arizona . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
