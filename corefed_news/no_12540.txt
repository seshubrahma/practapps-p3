He said New York values Ted Cruz New York and they ’re about the media . New York values ’s an    trope from a hundred years . It ’s been around for a very long time . Everyone in New York , everyone in New York country understands what he was saying . And that ’s Ted Cruz big problem once you get to New York , not just among New York , but among people who do n’t appreciate those kinds of stereotypes . Trump is going to hammer away on it . And Cruz can try to explain it away , but you ca n’t explain it you said when its meaning is obvious . Host Wolf Blitzer it that Cruz had said he was referring to New Cruz Democratic politicians Trump but Toobin New York was n’t buying that explanation . " But Toobin have nothing to do with money and media . Money and media is Jews . I mean , this is just an      stereotype derogatory term and everybody understands it .
