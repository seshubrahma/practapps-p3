Trump had plenty of cheers , but many more boos , over the course of the evening . As Republican frontrunner Donald J. Trump did in New Hampshire , Republican frontrunner Donald J. Trump blamed the response on Jeb Bush ’s supporters , " special interests , " and " lobbyists " in the audience .   Party insiders and donors usually do have the inside track to debate tickets .

Out of those 1600 seats , candidates received 600 tickets to invite their candidates . The state party and locally elected officials received 550 , while the RNC , including nationally elected officials , received 367 tickets . The debate partners , CBS News , the Peace Center , and Google received 100 tickets .
