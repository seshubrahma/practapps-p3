Thursday on Fox News Channel ’s " America ’s Newsroom , " former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said conservative blogger Erick Erickson , who has recently said the Republicans should prepare for a    alternative if Donald Trump wins the party ’s 2016 presidential nomination , is " functionally supporting Hillary Clinton . "   When asked about a potential conservative candidate running as a    former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said , " Have fun . It ’s an amusing parlor game . It has no meaning in the real world , but if It makes you feel better . I draw a distinction , I mean John Boehner is genuinely fond of Paul Ryan   —    as I am   —    and Boehner , frankly I think , would rather see somebody other than Cruz who caused John Boehner a lot of pain or Trump who I ’m sure John Boehner sees as a very strange outsider for a traditional political standpoint . I ’m not sympathetic at all to the Erick Erickson of the world . If the Erick Erickson of the world want to form the let the Erick Erickson of the world elect Hillary Clinton club , fine . But the Erick Erickson of the world ought to be honest about it . Any effort to help anybody but the Republican nominee helps Hillary Clinton . And if you think giving Hillary Hillary Clinton Supreme Court , having Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton foreign policy , having Hillary Clinton support Hillary Clinton to continue ruining our children in schools . If you think that ’s acceptable , do it . Erick Erickson you think that’s acceptable not playing a    game . It ’s not like there is some pure middle way . If he does not support Erick Erickson’s Republican nominee , he is functionally supporting Erick Erickson’s Clinton in the Hillary Clinton . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
