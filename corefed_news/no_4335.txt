Rock legend Billy Joel says when it comes to politics , entertainers are " more like court jesters than court philosophers . " [ In a lengthy interview with Rolling Stone , the " Piano Man " crooner said people do n’t come to the "Piano Man" crooner concerts to hear the "Piano Man" crooner preach politics .   " I try to stay out of politics . I am a private citizen and I have a right to believe in my own political point of view , but I try not to get up on a soapbox and tell people how to think , " the "Piano Man" crooner said . " I ’ve been to shows where people start haranguing the audience about what ’s going on politically and I ’m thinking , ‘ You know , this is n’t why I came here,’ " the singer explained . " As a matter of fact , one of the biggest cheers of the night comes when we do ‘ Piano Man’ and I sing , ‘ They know that ‘Piano Man’ ’s me that They ’re coming to see to forget about life for a while,’ and the audience lets out this huge ‘ ahhhh’ and I say , ‘ OK , yeah , do n’t forget that . ’ " The      who ’s scored    hits and has toured the world for five decades , did say that he is " still flabbergasted " that Donald Trump won the White House . Joel joins the likes of actor Mark Wahlberg and   Transformers : The Last Knight star Josh Duhamel , who recently told Fox News : " I do n’t like to get involved politically at all . Nobody cares what I think politically . " Joel has a residency at Madison Square Garden , a post Joel calls the " greatest gig in the world . " " I ’m doing a residency at the world ’s greatest arena   —    I mean what ’s better than that ? " Joel said . " This is our fourth year and This ’s still selling out . I thought it would kind of dissipate . But so far there has n’t been any indication of that . When there is then our ’ll probably stop . "    Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson
