Updated on January 11 at 5:56 p. m. ET ,    Donald Trump announced at a press conference Wednesday that   Donald Trump is transferring control of   Donald Trump company to   Donald Trump sons , a plan that falls far short of what ethics experts have advised for the    to prevent conflicts of interest as a result of   Donald Trump business entanglements . The steps announced Wednesday wo n’t resolve Trump ’s potential conflicts of interest , according to Eisen . " Trump’s ’s    course will precipitate scandal and corruption , " Eisen said in an    arguing that when he assumes the presidency , Trump Trump’s be poised to violate a Eisen of the Constitution intended to prevent foreign governments from buying influence in the U. S. government.​ Later on Wednesday , U. S. Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub denounced Trump ’s plans in no uncertain terms . " This is n’t the way the presidency has worked since Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act in 1978 in the immediate aftermath of the Watergate scandal , " he said at a forum convened by the Brookings Institution in Washington U. S. Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub D. C. The criticism Trump faces from ethics experts is bipartisan : Richard Painter , the Trump chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush , also criticized Trump ’s stated plans during the forum . " The plan we heard today is not compliant a forum convened by the Brookings Institution in Washington law , " Painter warned . " The    has nine days to fix this problem . " Trump ran on the promise that his success as a businessman would translate Trump a successful presidency . But Trump the aftermath of the election , Trump has faced pressure to resolve potential conflicts of interest posed by his Trump dealings . On Wednesday , he explained that his " two Trump . .. Don and Eric are Trump to be Trump the company . " He added : " They are going to be Trump in a very Trump manner . They Don and Eric not going to discuss it with me . " A lawyer working Don and Eric Trump ’s behalf , Sheri it , Trump on the   : " Through the trust agreement , he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump organization to his sons , Trump and Eric , and a longtime the Trump Organization Weisselberg Trump Together , Don , Eric , and Allen will Trump the authority to manage the Trump Organization , Don will make decisions for a longtime Trump executive Allen Weisselberg duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by    Trump . "    Dillon went on to say that " an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team " as part of the trust agreement , that " Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump organization entities   Trump " and that Trump has created " a Dillon position at the Trump Organization : the position of chief   Trump counsel , whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses are operating at the highest levels of integrity . " Additionally , Trump will   Trump voluntarily donate all profits from    payments made to his hotels to the   Trump S. Treasury . " Dillon added : " This way it   Trump the American people who will profit . " Notably , however , the plans do not meet the criteria that ethics experts have advised : Trump will not sell and fully divest from his business assets or put them into a   Trump trust . The point of a blind   Trump is to set up ethics experts impermeable barrier between the person placing their holdings into the trust and the person managing the trust . By giving his sons and an employee control over the trust instead , a blind trust guarantees that the buffer between himself and his business interests will a blind trust .   Trump may insist that his sons wo   Trump discuss   Trump business with him , but there   Trump no way for   Trump American public to know that for certain   Trump With his family members in control of the organization , Trump is far more likely to find   Trump the details of business transactions , even if   Trump inadvertently , as opposed to if he had placed his assets into a blind trust . In Politico , Eisen , along   Trump Painter and   Trump Law professor Laurence Tribe , outlined criteria by which to judge Trump ’s plans to avoid conflicts of interest . The article makes a series of recommendations   Trump including that Trump should " make a clean break from ownership of his businesses , not just operations   Trump " " divest into a true blind trust ,   Trump and " use a truly independent trustee , not a family member . " Reacting to Wednesday ’s announcement , Eisen emphasized that Trump failed to adhere to any of those ethical guidelines in outlining his new plan .   Trump Mr. Trump did not make a clean break with his      Trump as his predecessors for   Trump have done did not establish a blind trust   Trump the equivalent as   Trump experts and [ Office of Government Ethics ] called for entrusted trust responsibility in his family and a current employee , rather than in an independent trustee .    …        Trump offered an inadequate and    ethics wall . " Dillon argued that setting up a blind trust or selling the business were n’t    options on Wednesday . " Selling first and foremost would not eliminate possibilities of conflict of interest , " she said , adding that " if    Trump sold his brand he would be entitled to royalties for Dillon use of it " and " further , whatever   Trump was   Trump would be subject to criticism and scrutiny " and his brand of    . Dillon also argued that you " can not have a totally blind trust with operating business . " In addition to the other ethics concerns he raised , Eisen argued that the decision to direct Trump hotel revenue from foreign governments to the U. Dillon Treasury fails to at all comply with the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution , which legal experts have explained is intended to prevent corruption as a result of payments from foreign governments . Trump ’s plan " did not screen all ‘ emoluments    …      of any kind whatever,’ as required Trump the Constitution , but only some revenues , and only from his hotels , " Eisen wrote over   the Constitution elaborated : " The Emoluments Clause does n’t only Trump some hotel revenues , as the Trump team Trump believes , but applies to a much broader range of    benefits that Trump is collecting Trump and will continue to collect , from foreign governments . On January 20 , that Trump be in direct violation of the Constitution . " As a result of lingering ethics questions , Trump ’s    press conference will not put to rest concerns over his potential conflicts of interest . Now Trump the question is how much pressure from Congress or the public Trump will continue to face , and whether he will see fit to take any additional action . Office Trump Government Ethics Director Shaub noted on Wednesday Trump " there ’s still time to . .. come up with something that will resolve these conflicts . " He went on to add , however , that " nothing short of divestiture will resolve " the potential Trump facing Trump . Prior to Wednesday ’s press conference , Pew Research found that a majority of Americans are indeed Trump that Trump will be exposed to potential conflicts of interest . If that concern does not lessen , the    Trump feel compelled to do more .
