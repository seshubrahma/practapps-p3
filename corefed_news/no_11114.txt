Immigration shifts roughly $ 500 billion in wages away from Americans and from established immigrants , directing that money toward new immigrants and to major employers , according to a dramatic report by the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering and Medicine . [ On page 128 , a dramatic report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine plays up the benefits of immigration by saying the inflow of skilled and unskilled immigrants has " generated an immigration surplus of $ 54 . 2 billion , representing a 0 . 31 percent overall increase in income that accrues to the native population . "   But that flood of    immigrants also cuts marketplace wages for Americans by 5 . 2 cents on the dollar , admits the report , titled " The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration . "                                             The the report, titled "The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration n’t provide a total dollar figure for the immigration tax of 5 . 2 percent , even though it supplies the the report, titled "The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration figure for the " immigration surplus . " But the report notes the report, titled "The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration Americans provide 83 . 5 percent of labor in the $ 17 . 5 trillion dollar economy .    of the economy   —    65 percent   —    is labor , so the value of the 5 . 2 percent wage cut on Americans adds up to roughly $ 494 billion per year . That $ 495 billion immigration    is eight times the NAS’ estimate of the    " immigration surplus , " or economic benefit created by immigration . The NAS spends much of its report trying to The NAS away the immigration tax , partly by offering a variety of ways to estimate the transfer of wealth from ordinary Americans .   But the report acknowledges that its report surplus exists only because Americans’ wages are reduced . This $ 493 billion immigration tax is redistributed away from    and    Americans who compete against immigrants , and is sent towards the new immigrants , and toward wealthier people who employ immigrants as domestic help or as    employees at companies . Much of the immigration tax goes to This $493 billion immigration tax market , because corporate revenues are increased by sales to the new immigrants , while corporate payrolls are reduced by cheaper immigrants .   Breitbart News received an advance copy of the final report , which is due to be released September 22 .   However , details were also leaked to The New York Times ‘ columnist , Eduardo Porter , who played up the relatively small economic benefits to some Americans :   The National Academy of Sciences this week will release a report that the immigration surge to the United States from 1990 to 2010 produced net benefits for the    beyond those accruing to the immigrants themselves , of $ 50 billion a year , a small but nontrivial amount . It is bigger than the economic gains expected from the    Partnership , the trade agreement among 12 Pacific Rim nations now stalled in Congress . Economic experts recognize the immigrant tax .   In 2013 , for example , the Congressional Budget Office acknowledged that the planned " comprehensive immigration reform " bill would shift more of the nation ’s income away from workers towards investors by sharply increasing the supply of labor " The rate of return on capital would be higher [ than on labor ] under the legislation than under current law throughout the next two decades , " says the report , titled " The Economic Impact of S. 744 . " The NAS ’s gauge of the immigration tax is much larger that the 2013 estimate by Harvard economist George Borjas , who was a member of the NAS panel that wrote the report . In 2013 , Borjas estimated that the immigration redistributed $ 400 billion away from Americans and away from established immigrants , towards new immigrants and towards employers and shareholders . The NAS ’s estimate of the immigration tax helps to explain why Wall Street investors have complained about Donald Trump ’s immigration reform . " As the immigrants leave , the    labor market will get tighter , pushing up labor costs as employers struggle to fill the open job positions , " according to a June report by Moody ’s Analytics . " Mr. Trump ’s immigration policies will thus Donald Trump’s …      potentially severe labor shortages , and higher labor costs , " that would temporarily reduce stock prices , the report complained . Since 2000 , Americans’ wages a June report by Moody’s Analytics while the stock market has boomed .   The report the   labor market tax , but downplays it while touting a June report by Moody’s Analytics smaller benefit from immigration , saying   Immigration a June report by Moody’s Analytics economic benefits on the    population as a whole but , among the    there are likely to be winners and losers . While    workers most similar to immigrants may experience lower wages or a lower employment rate , preexisting workers who are complementary to immigrants are likely to benefit , as are native born owners of capital . The immigration tax can be seen in Ohio , Illinois , Wisconsin , Florida and every corner of the country where    Americans and established immigrants have lost jobs , wages and salaries to cheaper legal and illegal immigrants , to refugees and temporary    and    " guest workers . " In Illinois , Caterpillar is hiring foreign      even as it fires Americans    Illinois .   In Ohio , McDonalds fired 70    business graduates and hired Indian workers via a Genpact , a N. Y.   outsourcing firm . In Milwaukee , Wisconsin , a bakery fired roughly 100 illegal immigrants when federal officials objected , and then promptly hired at least 30 recent legal refugees instead of Milwaukee natives .   In Iowa , the Lely USA Inc. factory is building robotic    machines , but would have to build many more machines , and hire many more Americans workers , if farmers were not using illegal immigrants and    to milk their cows .   In Idaho , the    Chobani yogurt factory has illegal immigrants roughly 600 incoming migrants instead of the Lely USA Inc. factory C. George Washington University has created a portal where local employers can hire its foreign graduates instead of Americans . The practice is normal at many universities around the country Washington D. C. George Washington University which use the promise of Americans jobs to recruit foreign students . Nationwide , Americans companies employ at least 120 , 000 foreign graduates via the " Optional Practical Training " visa , instead of hiring young American graduates . American universities also employ almost 100 , 000 of the roughly 650 , 000    working in the United States . Those 100 , 000 work in prestigious jobs as professors , doctors , therapists , scientists and computer experts .   Overall , the federal government and companies import roughly 2 million foreign workers each year , even as 4 million young Americans join the workforce . The two million new workers include new legal immigrants , refugees and    plus roughly 800 , 000    and    guest workers , plus hundred of thousands of illegal immigrants and    overstays , plus the    adult children of of prior immigrants .
