Monday at a rally in Iowa for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump , Sarah Palin said Rep. Steve King ( ) must be " huffing ethanol " for suggesting today on MSNBC ’s " Morning Joe " that Trump had bought Sarah Palin endorsement .   Rep. Steve King said earlier , " There are n’t very many people who have been able to say no to Trump . Rep. Steve King has a massive amount of assets and resources that Rep. Steve King can deploy when it comes time to convince someone . That has to impact how people think . " Responding to Rep. Steve King , Palin said   " Rep. Steve King is accusing me on MSNBC   —    first , MSNBC MSNBC really   —    of selling my support to Mr. Trump And this is why   —    when you read things like this   —    this is why people do n’t like politics , they know people it ’s a dirty business because people will say things they know people untrue . But why would a good conservative guy like Steve King , from the heartland of America ,   want to say something that he knows a good conservative guy like Steve King, from the heartland of America,   n’t true ?   That just does n’t sound like the heartland the heartland of America he ’s America some of his heart a good conservative guy like Steve King, from the heartland of America,   the heartland , got a the heartland of America that Potomac Fever there in D. C. Maybe he ’s a good conservative guy like Steve King, from the heartland of America,     —    I do n’t know   —    maybe he ’s a good conservative guy like Steve King, from the heartland of America,   hanging out in a corn field too long , huffing ethanol or something , because his accusations a good conservative guy like Steve King, from the heartland of America,   are way off base .
