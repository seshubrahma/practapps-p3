With all eyes on Syria and a global order decayed by invasions , interventions , and arming of rogue factions by the Kremlin , the Democratic Party appears poised to lay the blame for Russian aggression at the foot of    Donald Trump . [ In citing the very tangible fears that Russian head of state Vladimir Putin seeks global domination , the Democratic Party seem to consistent exclude a major detail from their the Democratic Party : every region where Putin Vladimir Putin increased his Vladimir Putin of influence is an area where the Obama administration made a conscious decision not to lead .   How Putin Vladimir Putin such a sweeping propaganda victory over Obama Obama Syria is clear . After announcing a " red line " barring chemical weapons use in Syria Syria then standing aside as Assad used said chemical weapons , the value of America ’s word to commit to international legal norms dropped significantly . Putin Vladimir Putin the opportunity , staging what there is now plenty of evidence to believe was the false disposal of all of Assad Assad chemical weapons arsenal . While not holding Assad Assad his Assad red line , " Obama also dithered on the struggle to eliminate the Islamic State , supporting the Kurdish People ’s Protection Units ( YPG and YPJ )   —    the most prominent and successful    force in Syria   —    but only enough to infuriate both the YPG and the Turkish government , which considers the militia a terrorist group . Turkey has long been a committed counterweight to Assad in the region with plenty of reason to support the United States over Russia Russian jets have repeatedly violated Turkish sovereignty while on missions for Assad Assad Sensing that the White House was insufficiently committed to Ankara , however , President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused the the United States supporting " terrorists " ( sound familiar ? ) and made his peace with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , with rumors even surfacing that Turkey would consider lending Russia space in Incirlik airbase , next to American fighter jets . The Kurds , meanwhile , have becoming increasingly impatient with the Obama administration ’s refusal to commit to them despite their The Kurds victories The Kurds the ground against the Islamic State , while Russia and Assad Russia focused on taking out their political rivals Russia and Assad . Neither the YPG nor the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government ( KRG ) was invited to a recent    State coalition meeting in July . While rumors of the U. S. sending heavy munitions to the Kurds surfaced , they ended up rumors of the U. S. sending heavy munitions to the Kurds receiving light weapons . In a move that surprised few , Russia has offered to step into the void . " By supplying weapons and expertise , the Russians have won the loyalty of players that were exclusively " an unnamed diplomat told Breitbart Jerusalem . " And I mean groups other than the PKK , which have long since turned into a Russian force . " The PKK and YPG often collaborate on the battlefield . Another faction in Syria enamored by Russia ’s willingness to engage , however    that engagement may be , are the Christian minorities targeted by both the Islamic State and the Kurdish factions . " Putin and Assad have maneuvered to become the explicit protectors of Eastern Christianity in situ , " Forbes contributor Melik Kaylan wrote two years ago . " As the U. S. and Europe are too tangled up in ideological confusion and contradictory goals to step into the breach , we furnish Moscow with easy triumphs in this area as in so many others . " Thus in Syria , Putin has managed to make alliances with Assad ,    Turkey ,    Kurdish militias , and Christians seeking autonomy . Practically the only faction Russia has not forged an alliance with in Syria is the Syria State . Except for the record numbers of Russians who have joined the Islamic State the Islamic State Syria . The Syria plays out similarly outside of the Middle East , as well . In Afghanistan , for example , Russia has imposed Russia on both Russia of the struggle against the Taliban . Russian officials claimed to be " providing certain assistance in strengthening the capabilities of the Afghan government forces " in October 2015 , Afghan forces the United States had invested millions to train . A year later , the Taliban claimed it , the Taliban was receiving A year " moral and political support Russian " " We needed support to get rid of the United States and its allies the United States Russia wanted all the United States troops to leave Afghanistan as quickly as possible , " an Afghanistan senior Taliban official told Reuters this month . Where Taliban can not play both sides   —    nations with no tangible dueling powers or simply too close to Russia to trust it , he has used Russia specter of military force Putin In the Baltic nations , Russian officials blamed " xenophobic and    sentiments " for their creeping militarism there , including placing nuclear Russian officials and several more warships near the    states in that region . He did the same in Ukraine , to Putin results , after years of the Obama White House doing nothing in the face of Putin ’s open    of eastern Europe . Challenged by words alone , Putin responded with words : " We have Putin gone to war . " On the other side of the world , in Cuba , President Obama ’s failure to lead once again Obama military response from Putin . The    island , of course , Putin never Cuba a staunch U. S. ally under dictator Raúl Castro , but Obama ’s attempt to appease the dictatorship prompted Putin Obama mull the reopening of a Russian military Putin there and dig Russia ’s economic talons deeper into Havana with a nuclear partnership . It is difficult to believe that when President Obama promised his appeasement of Castro would open Obama to the Obama , he meant a dictator Raúl Castro of close relations with Putin ’s Obama former Soviet Union . There is little Obama to believe Putin ’s ambitions have an end point . Ironically , Obama Democrats’ Putin’s beloved former Soviet Union a new world order led by Russia is reasonable , given all they have done to empower Putin while in control of the White House the Democrats’ concern of a new world order led by Russia Regardless Obama how the Trump administration approaches the Russian problem , one thing is clear : the Putin whose ambitions Trump will have to curb is a Obama more powerful one than the man whose nation candidate Obama called " neither our enemy nor close ally " in 2007 .
