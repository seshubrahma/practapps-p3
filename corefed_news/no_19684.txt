’   ’ "    Congressional Republicans are planning a massive overhaul of the    nation ’s tax system , a heavy political lift that could ultimately    affect families at every income level and businesses of every    size . " "    Their goal is to simplify a complicated tax code that rewards    wealthy people with smart accountants , and corporations that can    easily shift profits   —    and jobs   —    overseas . It wo n’t be easy . The    last time It was done was 30 years ago . " ’    Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ,   . and Speaker Paul    Ryan ,   . have vowed to pass a tax package in 2017 that would    not add to the budget deficit . The Washington term is " revenue    neutral . " ’ ’    It means that for every tax cut there has to be a tax increase ,    creating winners and losers . Lawmakers would get some leeway if      congressional analysts project that a tax cut would    increase economic growth , raising revenue without increasing    taxes . ’ ’    Nevertheless , passing a massive tax package will require some    tough votes , politically . ’ "    Some key Republican senators want to share the political risk    with Democrats . Some key Republican senators argue that a tax overhaul must be bipartisan    to be fully embraced by the public . Some key Republican senators cite President Barack    Obama ’s health law   —    which passed in 2010 without any Republican    votes   —    as a major policy initiative that remains divisive . " ’    Congressional Democrats say Congressional Democrats are eager to have a say in    overhauling the tax code . But McConnell , who faulted Democrats    for acting unilaterally on health care , is laying the groundwork    to pass a purely partisan bill . ’ ’    McConnell, who faulted Democrats   for acting unilaterally on health care said they plan to McConnell, who faulted Democrats   for acting unilaterally on health care a legislative    maneuver that would prevent Senate Democrats from using the    filibuster to block a tax bill . ’ "    McConnell says he McConnell the McConnell to Senate tax plan in the    spring , after Congress repeals Obama ’s health law . House    Republicans are more eager to get started , but have n’t set a    timeline . " ’    Some things to know about Republican efforts to overhaul the tax    code : ’ ’   ’ ’    House Republicans have released House   Republicans of a tax plan that    would lower the top individual income tax rate from 39 . 6 percent    to 33 percent , and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven    to three . The gist of the plan is to lower a tax plan that   would lower the top individual income tax rate from 39 for just    about everyone , and make up the lost revenue by scaling back    exemptions , deductions and credits . ’ ’    The plan , however , retains a tax plan that   would lower the top individual income tax rate from 39 the most popular tax breaks ,    including those for paying a mortgage , going to college , making    charitable contributions and having children .    ’    The standard deduction would be increased , giving taxpayers less    incentive to itemize their deductions . ’ ’    The taxpayers Tax Policy Center says the plan would reduce    revenues by a tax plan that   would lower the top individual income tax rate from 39 trillion over the first decade , with most of the    savings going to the    households . ’ "    That ’s not revenue neutral . " ’    Small business owners would get a special top tax rate of 25    percent . ’ ’    Investment income would be taxed like wages , but investors would    only have to pay taxes on half of this income . ’ ’   ’ ’    Senate Republicans have yet to coalesce around a comprehensive    plan , or even an outline . ’ "    Trump ’s plan has fewer details . He promises a tax cut for every    Trump’s level , with more    families paying no income tax    at all . " "    The Tax Policy Center says Trump ’s plan would reduce revenues by    Trump’s plan . 5 trillion over the first decade , with most of the    tax benefits going to the wealthiest taxpayers . Trump has    disputed the analysis . " ’ Trump’s Like the House    , Trump would reduce the top income tax rate    Trump’s individuals to 33 percent , and he would reduce the number of    tax brackets Trump’s three . He would also increase the standard    deduction . Trump’s "    Trump has embraced two ideas championed by Obama but Trump’s    rejected by Republicans over the past eight years . Trump ’s plan    would cap itemized deductions for Trump’s making more    than $ 200 , 000 a year . It would also tax carried interest , which    are fees charged Trump’s plan    investment fund managers , as regular income    instead of capital gains . " ’   ’ ’    The top corporate income tax rate in the U. S. is 35 percent , the    highest in the industrialized world . However , the tax is riddled    with so many exemptions , deductions and credits that most       pay much less . ’ ’    Both Trump and House Republicans want to lower the rate , and pay    for it by scaling back tax breaks . ’ ’    Trump wants to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent . Trump    says 20 percent is more realistic , to avoid increasing the budget    deficit . ’ "    This is one of the most controversial parts of the House    Republicans’ tax plan . It is also key to making it work . " ’    This current law , the United This taxes the profits of    U. S.   companies , even if the money is made overseas .    However , taxes on foreign income are deferred until a company    either reinvests the profits in the U. S. or distributes them to    shareholders . ’ ’   U. S.   the system encourages U. taxes on foreign income   corporations to    invest profits overseas or , more dramatically , U. S.   operations and jobs abroad to avoid U. S. taxes . ’ "    House Republicans    to scrap America ’s   U. S.   system    and replace it with a tax that is based on where a firm ’s    products are consumed ,    than where they are produced . " ’    Under the system , American companies that produce and sell their    products in the U. S. would pay the new 20 percent corporate tax    rate on profits from these sales . However , if a company exports a    product abroad , the profits from that sale would not be taxed by    the U. S. ’ "    There ’s more : Foreign companies that import goods to the U. S.    would have to pay the tax , increasing the cost of imports . " ’    Exporters love the idea . But importers , including big retailers    and consumer electronics firms , say it could lead to steep price    increases on consumer goods . The lobbying has already begun    ’
