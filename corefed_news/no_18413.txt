Meanwhile , established financial firms    are positioned to step up financial firms    spending . ’ ’    In a big note out to clients on May 18 titled " Fintech : A    Gauntlet to Riches , " a group of equity analysts at Morgan Stanley    said this shift will lead to an environment    where legacy firms , or incumbents , " take the reigns"of    financial innovation . ’ ’    " Financials and payments incumbents are likely to be emboldened    to step up R&D and take the investment lead , and this    combination of    behavior represents a paradigm shift    that should benefit incumbents ’’ [ return on investment ] , " Morgan    Stanley said . ’ ’    Financial technology companies experienced a surge in funding    from 2012 to 2015 , during which time venture capital firms poured    $ 92 billion into the space . Now it looks like venture capital firms are    experiencing a bit of a hangover . ’ ’    In 2016 , global venture capital investment in fintech companies    dipped to $ 25 billion , from $ 47 billion in 2015 . ’ ’   ’ ’    In a recent interview with Business Insider , Amy Nauiokas ,    the head of Anthemis Group , a New    venture capital    firm , described the time leading up to the dip as a " period of    exuberance    " ’ ’    " Big firms just sort of piled on a bunch of , let’ ’s say , happy    money , " Firms were thinking , we have Big firms , we have Big firms , we    Big firms to spend it , " she said    ’ ’    This environment of " happy money " sent valuations for    fintechs to levels that some investors view as unreasonably    high    For instance ,   ’ ’   ’ ’    According to Morgan Stanley , there are a number of factors that    will push legacy financial firms to step up their    legacy financial firms    fintech companies . The most obvious factor is the    fear of disruption . ’ ’    " [ T]he threat of disruption from fintechs is forcing incumbents    to up their investments incumbents    technology to gain operating    efficiencies and preserve market share , " the bank said .   ’ "    Deregulation is another trigger . If the Trump administration    follows through     then   firms wo n’t have to    spend    much cash on regulatory compliance . That would free    up    for fintech investment initiatives . Legacy firms’ focus    on lowering cost also provides an incentive to invest in    fintech    " ’    " Managing expenses remains a key focus for incumbents as one of    the    for earnings growth , " the bank said . " It follows that    there is an increasing trend towards implementing more technology    to drive efficiencies with moderated headcount growth going    forward    " ’ ’    What is the net outcome of this shift ? A better business    landscape for    Wall Street firms . ’ ’    " As incumbents pick up investment while VCs reduce investment , we    tilt towards a world where incumbents are less susceptible to    disintermediation    more likely to    new    , "    the bank said .   ’ ’A " paradigm shift " is taking place in financial . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
