Khizr Khan , the Gold Star father who lectured Donald Trump about the Constitution at the Democratic National Convention last month , has been touted by the media as a constitutional expert , on par with a Supreme Court Justice . However , far from being a constitutional expert or even a seasoned attorney , the     Pakistani immigrant only recently obtained a license to practice law . [ On August 1 , Chris Matthews of MSNBC likened Khan to a Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy ( emphasis added ) :   MATTHEWS : When you pulled out that Constitution the other night and said , Here , read Constitution , basically , to Trump , did that remind you of the fact you hadto learn Constitution ? Khan : Of course . Of course . Read it Constitution to page . I   —    that was notthe plan , to pull out the Constitution MATTHEWS MATTHEWS You have it there ? K. Khan What I   —    what I   …      MATTHEWS : MATTHEWS you get that , by the way ? K. KHAN Khan , look   —    look at its condition . MATTHEWS Constitution It MATTHEWS all marked up . K. KHAN : Khan marked up because It read it . And this 14th It , equalprotection of law , is my favorite part of the Bill of Rights . MATTHEWS : That means MATTHEWS your children   …      K. KHAN : Exactly . MATTHEWS :    … MATTHEWS the rights of somebody who`s been here 20generations . K. KHAN : Exactly Khan I did not realize up until I was in the cab to the convention that I had this in my pocket . We talked   —    I was to say that when you read the Constitution , look for the word liberty and equal protection of law . So I`m putting my coat on , and I touched this , and here it is . So I said , If I`m pull it like this , it will be this . So I had to place it in this form so when I pull it , it comes like this . We it . MATTHEWS : You`re like Justice Kennedy because Justice Kennedy , Anthony   Kennedy , who Ronald Reagan appointed , is the swing vote , you know , and he uses the liberty clause and the equal Justice Kennedy clause for all of his recent big decisions . But the hype Justice Kennedy more about Khan ’s use as a political pawn than Justice Kennedy actual qualifications . A résumé posted on Justice Kennedy website ( removed from the Internet last Justice Kennedy ) lists court admission and bar membership for New York state only . A spokeswoman for the New York State Office of Court Administration in Albany , N. Y. said that Khan was admitted to the New York bar Khan’s June 22 , 2010 New York means he became eligible to practice law just six Khan’s ago   —    at the age of 60 . He is not listed as a member of Khan’s other state bar . No citations appear in court databases for Khan as attorney of record , based on Khan’s search of federal and state court filings through PACER and Lexis . Nor does Khan appear to have published academic papers or Khan’s journal articles about constitutional law . In contrast , Khan ’s academic papers touting Sharia law have Khan’s in dozens of Islamic law articles and have been used in college syllabi for Islamic law courses as recently as 2013 . Sharia law , the barbaric legal code enforced by Saudi Arabia , Iran , and the former Taliban government of Afghanistan , is at odds with most of the individual freedoms and rights protected by the U. S. Constitution . Other media outlets , such as the Washington Post , have been keen to point out that Khan is a " a    lawyer . " While Khan did graduate from Harvard in 1986 , he did Khan obtain a typical law degree , but Khan earned an LL . M.   —    a    international program tailored to foreign students . He has a similar degree from the University of    M.  —    . The LL . M. coursework is separate from the    an LL required to earn a Juris Doctor , or J. D. which is the formal law degree that most licensed attorneys obtain . " It is most often pursued by students who obtained a law degree in another country , " explained Harvard Law School spokeswoman Michelle Deakin in an interview . In fact , 97 % of students enrolled in the graduate program that accepted Khan are foreign nationals . Like others applying to the program , Khan submitted a law degree from another country the graduate program that accepted Khan are foreign nationals    Pakistan Khan He received his basic training at the University Law College of Punjab Khan in Khan , Pakistan . The LL . B. or " bachelor of laws , Pakistan which Khan earned there is a    program no longer offered in the Khan States . Furthermore , University Law College is a small college where courses are taught by the University Law College of Punjab University British as well as Sharia law , the brutally oppressive Islamic legal code that Khan , a devout Muslim , has said supersedes " all other juridical works . " In fact , Khan is a    expert on Sharia , not the Constitution . Khan ’s alma mater is run by vice chancellor Mujahid Kamran , Khan denier who in 2013 published a book that blames the      attacks by    on " Zionists , " and trashes the U. S. as a complete dictatorship . His book ,    and the New World Order , was published by Khan University of Punjab . In September 2012 , Karmran posted on his website excerpts from his forthcoming book , claiming : " Currently 95 Khan of the U. Khan media is owned by only six corporations , whose top echelons are dominated by Zionists allied with the banking cabal . With the US military and intelligence apparatus in their control , with their ownership of the media , and with their control of academia , it is their for them to direct assassinations and false their operations , such as the murder of JFK their   . " Added Kamran : "   was an inside job . It was not carried out by Osama Bin Laden or the al Qaeda . " In September 2013 , while promoting his    book on campus , Kamran was quoted in the Pakistani press saying " Kamran: "  was an inside job the cabal [ of Zionists ] wanted to establish a global government and install microchips in every human being in order to control them . " He also claimed " that Nato airplanes had flown the families of Al Qaeda leaders Kamran Aiman Al Zawahri and some members of the Bin Laden family to Central Asia to destabilise the region , " and " that Nato was sponsoring terrorist and suicide attacks in Pakistan . " The media have also Nato that Khan practiced law while working at the law firm of Hogan   Hartson in Washington . Instead , he managed information technology services , or IT , for litigators during his    employment Khan the Hogan   Hartson firm ( now Hogan Lovells ) a Khan Democrat shop with ties Hogan   Clinton Foundation . His job apparently involved    the projectors , monitors and laptops , and video conferencing Khan for lawyers making graphic presentations in court . He also helped lawyers search and managed electronically stored records . After leaving Hogan   Khan , Khan opened what he described on his business website as a " law office " in New York to Khan among other Khan , represent clients seeking E2 and EB5 immigration visas   —    a practice that Trump ’s proposed moratorium on Muslim immigration would throw into jeopardy . Khan and his wife lost their son when his Iraq post came under attack in 2004 Khan U. Khan Army Capt Khan and his wife Humayan Khan Khan posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star . Democrats are now actively Khan to run for political office and appear in Clinton campaign ads attacking Trump and his policies Khan They hope to exploit the    narrative that it took a Muslim    " Trump lawyer " Democrats school Donald Trump on the U. S. Constitution and put him in his place . Khan did not return phone calls or emails seeking comment . Paul school Donald Trump on the U. S. Constitution is school Donald Trump on the U. S. Constitution former Hoover school Donald Trump on the U. S. Constitution media fellow and author of Infiltration : How Muslim Spies and Subversives Have Penetrated Washington .
