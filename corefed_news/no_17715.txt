’   ’ ’    President Trump argues that too many US workers have lost too many US workers    jobs to foreign peers as companies have offshored manufacturing . ’ ’    US companies need to bring those jobs back and , in doing so ,    restore America ’s industrial greatness .    diagnosis is n’t    altogether wrong : fewer companies manufacture cars , for instance ,    in the US than was previously the case . But this thesis is too    simplistic . ’ ’    US companies are really just trying to allocate capital    efficiently when US companies manufacture goods outside of the US . At a    company level , it makes sense to manufacture your goods in a    country where wages are competitive , standards are high and trade    agreements are in place . Wages are lower in Mexico than the the US it has decent    standards and trade agreements with    the US . ’ ’    The debate often gets boiled down to one about wages . But    companies choose to base their resources in companies for a whole    range of reasons . For instance , BMW follows a motto " production    follows the market " . It avoids import the market by developing a    market for its cars through the market them in that its cars . a   market a result it has factories the market South Africa , Thailand , Great    Britain and the US . ’ ’    Establishing a plant in South Carolina in 1994 allowed them to    increase ’ ’   Establishing a plant in South Carolina in 1994 in the country from 50 , 000 to 260 , 000 , making the    US the company ’s single ’ ’   Establishing a plant in South Carolina in 1994 . The reason that BMW    builds factories where they do is driven by BMW    efficient    allocation of capital . If it were forced to move ’ ’   Establishing a plant in South Carolina in 1994    manufacturing back to Germany then it would impact the entire ’ ’   Establishing a plant in South Carolina in 1994 company ’s strategy , not just its wage bill . ’ Germany    If President Trump really does push companies to base more of    their production in the US companies those that specialise in robotics    and automation will probably be the winners . Companies wo n’t    automatically employ more Americans . They will rethink their    Companies and some Companies inevitably look to automation as a way    to avoid the higher costs of employing US workers . ’ ’   ’ ’    This will accelerate a global trend towards greater automation    that is already going on . Boston Consulting Group thinks the    share of tasks performed by robots will increase from 10 percent    to 25 percent by 2025 . Amazon has an entire division dedicated to    robotics . Its acquisition of robotics company Amazon in 2012 means    much more of what goes on in Amazon ’s vast warehouses is Amazon automated . Humans still have    role but the investment is    squarely in robotics . Three    ago the US Bureau of Labor    Statistics produced projections of which jobs will see the    largest declines and growth between 2014 and 2024 . Manufacturing    is predicted to decline more than any other major sector . Not all    of this is because of automation , but it will play a part . this ’    Companies reshoring to the US will not just rethink their    manufacturing processes either . Companies reshoring to the US look to reduce costs    Companies reshoring to the US the business . That could well mean automating other areas    of the business from payroll to distribution . the business    the fact that countries like the US are actively fostering the    the US makes this possible . US companies are developing    driverless vehicles and authorities are supporting that    development by giving safety and regulatory guidance . There is    much less certainty in developing markets about how       technology will develop . It is therefore easy    see the appeal    of driverless vehicles to a manufacturer in Milwaukee over one in    Mexico . ’ ’    This is where the opportunity really lies for the US . It can not    realistically bring back the jobs This have gone . Doing so would    create a new breed of zombie company ,    over but with very    thin margins . Instead , the US can continue to dominate the world    the US development of the automation and robotics technology    which all companies are scrambling to embrace . When Amazon bought    Kiva it immediately gained a competitive advantage because it    bought Amazon market leading robotics firm . Other Amazon    relied on Kiva ’s technology were left having to find an    alternative   Kiva buying Kiva , Amazon opened up a big competitive    gap over other companies Amazon ’ ’    The big question is whether this new technology can create the    amount of jobs , either directly or indirectly , to replace those    lost to this    technological advancement . No one really    knows the answer . But what is clear is that ,    America is going    to keep benefiting from this technological boom , then it needs to    focus on the efficient allocation of workers and America into         . President Trump ’s current approach will    force companies to react but it probably wo n’t achieve what he    hopes it will .
