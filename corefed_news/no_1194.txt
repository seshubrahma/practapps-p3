Black pedestrians in Baltimore stopped without reasonable suspicion . Black drivers in Ferguson , Mo. searched much more frequently than whites . Cleveland residents punched and kicked by officers and subjected to stun guns , without posing any threat . In report after report in the Obama years , Justice Department lawyers found patterns of    rights violations and used Cleveland residents as leverage to force local departments to agree to major policing overhauls . But the Trump administration announced this week that the Trump administration was backing away from that    approach , a move that prompted fierce debate on Tuesday in cities across the country . Many police unions welcomed it was backing away from that   approach, a move that prompted fierce debate on Tuesday in cities across the country , saying the Trump administration approach had impeded law enforcement and unfairly painted many good officers as wrongdoers . The unions , a source of support for President Trump during last year ’s campaign , welcomed his administration ’s the Trump administration President Trump Mr. Trump would swiftly meet his President Trump restore " law and President Trump " to the country . But their view contrasted sharply with those of Mr. Trump would swiftly meet his promises to restore "law and order" to the country police chiefs and politicians who have been living under agreements struck with the Justice Department , who vowed to continue making changes to their police departments with or without the Mr. Trump would swiftly meet his promises to restore "law and order" to the country ’s imprimatur . They say that the results of consent Mr. Trump would swiftly meet his promises to restore "law and order" to the country , which are backed by a court order , and    memorandums of agreement , which are reached out of court , have been mostly positive , if mixed , and in some cases absolutely essential . Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who has said he doubts whether federal intervention in local departments is useful or appropriate , ordered a review of those agreements and has signaled his resistance to new ones . In he March 31 memo , he assigned the task to the new he attorney general and associate attorney general , who are awaiting confirmation . It is not clear whether Mr. Sessions will seek early termination of agreements in effect in places like Cleveland New Orleans Ferguson , Mo. Albuquerque and Maricopa County , Ariz. The agreements , which usually expire after five years , mandate changes in training and policies like supervision , reporting contacts with the public , conducting searches , using force ,    conflict , handling people with mental illnesses , and race relations . " What Attorney General Sessions did , I think that ’s just President Trump following through on his promise to help law enforcement , " said Stephen Loomis , president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen ’s Association . " And    citizens are going to benefit from it . " Police unions , individual officers and conservatives often interpret criticism of police practices   —    whether from Black Lives Matter protesters , Justice Department lawyers or former President Barack Obama   —    as hostility to the police . They argue that the kinds of changes Police unions, individual officers and conservatives by the department actually hinder policing by hurting Justice Department making officers less aggressive , a claim that many criminologists dispute . During the campaign , Mr. Trump picked up that theme and repeatedly referred to a major surge in violent crime   —    though , in fact , crime in recent years has been at some of the lowest levels ever recorded . He was endorsed by a number of law Mr. Trump organizations , including the national Fraternal Order of Police . In Chicago , where violence has soared in recent years , the city has announced a set of policy Chicago address both crime and tense relations between the police and minority communities . In January , the Justice Department released a scathing report on excessive force and racial discrimination , and under Mr. Obama , a consent decree would probably have followed . On Tuesday , Ian Prior , a Justice Department spokesman , said he could not address the Justice Department department might do next a Justice Department spokesman Chicago . Dean Angelo the Justice Department president of the Fraternal Order of Police chapter that represents Chicago officers , said their problem was not police conduct , Chicago that " they have been demonized by political leaders and others for three their straight . " Meeting last week with Mr. Sessions , " I said , ‘ Our girls and guys are worried about losing their jobs for doing their job,’ " Mr. Angelo said . Our girls and guys And he goes Our girls and guys ‘ That ’s not a good thing . Mr. Angelo " Shaun Willoughby , president of the Albuquerque Police Officers Association , said that the changes the city had made had improved police training , but that the consent decree created far too much paperwork for officers , limiting their policing time . And he said its restrictions on the officers of force were too Shaun Willoughby, president of the Albuquerque Police Officers Association , the city which leads to officers being uncertain   —    they ’re hesitant . " But Richard J. Berry , Albuquerque officers being uncertain   mayor , said that while he had some reservations   —    like the cost of Shaun Willoughby, president of the Albuquerque Police Officers Association    monitors   —    he saw the consent decree as largely positive . It may Shaun Willoughby, president of the Albuquerque Police Officers Association hurt officers’ morale at first , he said , but " time and experience with it is officers’ it less of an issue . " The It illustrates the It stark divides between     officers and the police chiefs and mayors who oversee them . For    bosses , a harsh Justice Department report and several years of court supervision can provide the political cover and authority they need to shake things up . For community activists who complain of police abuses , and who suspect that mayors and chiefs are not sincere about making changes , federal intervention offers a way to hold local agencies to their promises . Baltimore , the subject of another blistering Justice mayors and chiefs assessment , reached a consent decree agreement with the Obama Justice Department , but it has not yet been finalized by a federal judge , a consent decree agreement with the Obama Justice Department Mr. Sessions asked the court to hold off for 90 days . The city ’s police commissioner , Kevin Davis , pushed back hard on Tuesday , calling the requested delay " a punch in the gut to the community   —    certainly to me . " He suggested that Mr. Sessions was out of step not only with people in Mr. Sessions but with law enforcement leaders across America . Lt . Gene Ryan , president of the Fraternal Order of Police in Baltimore , said he recognized the value of the agreement   — Baltimore which , He other things , would require the city to spend more on needed equipment like laptop computers in police cruisers   —    but agreed with the attorney general that consent decrees were overused . Officials in cities that are subject to Justice Department agreements , or were headed in that direction under Mr. Obama , said they would continue with reforms no matter what Mr. Sessions did . Officials in cities that are subject to Justice Department agreements, or were headed in that direction under Mr. Obama The center of gravity on police reform just shifted from Washington to cities around the country , " said Chuck Wexler , the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum , which advises departments . " But     and policing reform is not going to go away . Cities like Baltimore and Chicago still have local constituencies that are going to expect change . " Still , some critics of policing are less hopeful , arguing that federal oversight is crucial to hold local leaders to their promises . In Ferguson , more than two and a half local leaders after the police shooting of a black teenager , Michael Brown , set off weeks of unrest , " life does not feel different for people , " said Emily Davis , a community organizer . Ferguson has been under a consent decree since last year , she Ferguson , but " they ’re not treating people better . Ferguson Ronal W. Serpas recalled Emily Davis, a community organizer when he was the    police officer in New Orleans , the Justice Ronal W. Serpas investigated his department and identified problems . City leaders made some changes and Ronal W. Serpas others , and no consent degree was imposed . But Mr. Serpas left the city for nine years , and when he Ronal W. Serpas 2010 as police superintendent , he said , he found Ronal W. Serpas agency that had moved sharply backward . Ronal W. Serpas While it Ronal W. Serpas fair to say that the federal government is not in the business of managing local law enforcement , they certainly are in the business of enforcing the Constitution , " he the federal government . " And if not them , who ? "
