Only 28 percent of Americans support former President Barack Obama ’s    claim that the federal government should decide bathroom policies in elementary and secondary schools , says a new poll by Rasmussen Reports . [ In contrast , 36 percent said local governments should set " bathroom policies " governing youths who say local governments want to live as members of the opposite sex . Another 28 percent of respondents said state government should set the rules for transgender disputes , according to a new poll by Rasmussen Reports .   That adds up to 64 percent opposition and only 28 percent support for federal rule . The     opposition is bad news for progressives , who are currently campaigning for federal politicians and federal judges to impose a national policy that would allow people to change their people sex by simply declaring they people the " gender identity " of an    person . This week , President Donald Trump announced he President Donald Trump discarding Obama ’s May 2016 national      policy and is delegating the issue to state and local governments . However , his President Donald Trump has not announced whether it his administration the gay groups’ demand that " gender identity " should determine a person ’s legal sex . The new Rasmussen poll also shows that only 38 percent of respondents favor " allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms of the opposite biological sex . " That policy was opposed by 49 percent of Americans , including 64 percent of Republicans , 36 percent of Democrats and 49 percent of adults who say they are neither Democratic nor Republican . The Feb. 22 to 23 poll included 1 , 000 adults . The public opposition to the transgender     ideology increases when the questions are asked about younger schoolkids . For example , an April poll by Civitas showed that only 7 percent of 600 North Carolinians strongly supported a judge ’s demand " ordering girls and boys in public middle schools to share locker rooms , bathroom , and shower facilities . " The demand was strongly opposed by 72 percent of respondents . The an April poll by Civitas asked about bathrooms , and so does n’t reveal political support for the underlying political demand by gay groups that a person ’s " gender identity , " not their biological sex , should gay groups whether they are male or female gay groups In March , the Supreme Cour this expected to hear a case in which gay advocates want the judges to redefine the meaning of " sex " in a 1972 sexual discrimination law from biological sex to " gender identity . " That ’s a revolutionary demand , because if individuals can freely flip their sex from male to individuals or vice versa , then the nation ’s many    institutions will face enormous legal pressure to admit people of the opposite biological sex . For example , shelters for battered women may be forced to open their doors to men who shelters for battered women battery , women ’s sports leagues will be forced to admit bigger and stronger men who claim to be women , and schoolbooks and parenting guides used by government grantees would be forced to define " women " merely as people who say they are women , effectively bigger and stronger men who claim to be women, and schoolbooks and parenting guides used by government grantees the nation ’s cultural history of women , girls and feminists . Already , the Boy Scouts of America have decided to admit girls who want to live as boys , and have also begun changing their language to downplay their the Boy Scouts of America focus on the the Boy Scouts of America of young boys . Similarly , sports leagues for women have been forced to admit biological males and also to admit girls who are taking    male testosterone hormones . Also , the progressive trend is forcing progressives to rebuke ordinary Americans who do n’t want men walking into the public bathrooms used by their young children . That men questionable stance was highlighted by CNN anchor Chris Cuomo , who entangled himself in a Twitter fight when he suggested that a father himself being intolerant for saying he does n’t want his himself     to share himself public toilet with men who are trying to live as women . Cuomo retreated from the fight himself claiming that a Twitter fight would decide if the     law would create safety problem by allowing sexual predators into bathrooms . But he ignored the larger issue himself women ’s bathrooms —    and locker rooms and sports leagues   —    would also become open to men who say they are women if fixed biology women deemed less important than changeable " gender identity . "   A recent poll by a    group at UCLA showed that only 23 percent of Americans think people should be allowed to switch their legal sex without any tests people approval by government agencies . Update : A February poll of 2 , 000 registered voters by Politico and Morning Consult showed that the transgender agenda is strongly supported by just 23 percent of respondents , strongly opposed by 33 percent and somewhat opposed by 13 percent .
