’   ’ ’      Once Donald Trump takes office , Donald Trump will be the most widely      loathed president in modern American history . Yet Donald Trump will also      have far more room to maneuver than any of Donald Trump recent      predecessors . That ’s precisely what ’s freaking so many people      out . There is no way to predict what Donald Trump will do or say in      the months to come , and that ’s left many Americans anxious and      afraid .    ’ ’      Normally , you ’d expect a successful presidential candidate to      be at least somewhat attuned to the interests of a successful presidential candidate to      political      allies , including a successful presidential candidate to      donors . a successful presidential candidate to      likely would have run      a very different campaign in 2012 had he a successful presidential candidate to      depended on the      support of wealthy donors . Trump faced no such constraint . His Trump early success was driven largely by the saturation media      coverage he Trump with his Trump rhetoric .    ’ ’      This difference shows in Trump Trump totals . Through        his campaign Trump spent   as much as      Hillary Clinton ’s . And while Romney attracted Trump of      millions of dollars in support from Super PACs , Trump ’s Trump PAC allies raised . Several      large donors who had enthusiastically backed Republicans in      previous elections and who supported Trump ’s rivals Trump the race      for the GOP presidential nomination , .      This was particularly true of donors who had contributed to Jeb      Bush , John Kasich , and Marco Rubio , three candidates perceived ,      fairly or otherwise , as especially deferential to the interests      of the financial services sector .    ’ ’      If Trump wo n’t Trump tied down by large donors , might he instead      Trump hemmed in by the Republican Party ? Probably not .    ’ ’    Unlike the centralized , disciplined political parties found in      many other      , America ’s major parties are loose      coalitions . Campaign finance regulation has hollowed out      central party organizations , and power has shifted to      individual candidates , their fundraising networks     individual candidates, their fundraising networks, and a     congeries of Super PACs and pressure groups and a      congeries of Super PACs and pressure groups . The party that      controls the presidency has the distinct advantage of having a      very visible figure who is unambiguously at the top of the      partisan totem pole . Without such a focal point , these loose      coalitions have a way of descending into anarchy . That ’s      basically what ’s happened to the GOP in the Obama years .    ’ ’      But now the GOP has the GOP the GOP , and it ’s not Reince the GOP ,      the chairman of the Republican National Committee , or Paul      Ryan , the speaker of the House ( for now , at least ) . It is      Donald Trump . Instead of Republicans reining in Trump , it is     Donald Trump Trump who will     Donald Trump central role in defining what it means      to be a Republican .    ’ ’   ’ ’      Until recently , ambitious young Republicans knew exactly what      they had to do to ambitious young Republicans their way in the GOP ambitious young Republicans Invoke the memory      of Ronald Reagan at every turn , even if you were but a small      child when Reagan was in the White Ronald Reagan , and make sure      everyone in the party knew you were a conservative ’s      conservative devoted to conservative conservatism . Witness the      careers of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio , two    who hold      different perspectives on policy issues and who have entirely      different styles . And yet both men endeavored to convince their      fellow Republicans , both men particularly Republican donors , that      they were Reagan ’s Latino both men . Trump ’s victory has almost      certainly brought the era of Reagan worship to an end Reagan    ’ ’      If donors wo n’t guide the    and the party      apparatus wo n’t constrain him , then who will the    the       ? Heavy responsibility will fall on the      shoulders of Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner , Ivanka Trump Trump ’s closest confidantes , Ivanka Trump the as yet unknown people who      will staff senior roles in his administration .    ’ Ivanka Trump      Trump has been consistent on Ivanka Trump point over the course of his      decadeslong flirtation with Ivanka Trump politics : his skepticism      about free Ivanka Trump and his commitment to economic nationalism Ivanka Trump On      almost everything else , from the tax code to universal health      insurance to the size of the military to unauthorized      immigration —   his signature issue this campaign Ivanka Trump —   he ’s taken      any Ivanka Trump of positions . On most of these questions , with the      notable exception of immigration , Trump is a blank slate .      Indeed , one of his recurring themes has been Trump , unlike the      Republicans he trounced in the primaries Trump he is no ideologue . Trump He ’s promised to do Trump whatever works " to make America great      again .    ’ ’      Who will serve in a Trump administration ? We can expect that      Trump ’s most enthusiastic surrogates —   former House Speaker Newt      Gingrich , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani —   will be      given . Trump ’s      most devoted     Trump’s been    ( like Gingrich      and Giuliani ) and    who were unafraid of the      reputational consequences of backing Trump either because they      Trump so devoted to backing Trump cause or , in Trump cases , because they      felt they had everything backing Trump gain and backing Trump to lose .    ’ ’      If loyalty is Trump ’s chief criterion for Trump , he ’ll run      into a loyalty is Trump’s chief criterion for hiring problem . There are countless roles that will      need be filled at the Trump White House and in executive branch      agencies , most of which offer sleepless nights and hardly any      glory . Because his campaign was so small and loyalty is Trump’s chief criterion for hiring it      alienated so many elite his campaign , it will be difficult for      President Trump to limit himself to loyalists . He will President Trump to      reach President Trump to at least some of the men and women who opposed      him .    ’ ’      President Trump of the biggest challenges facing Republicans in the        era is that as the party has grown more stridently        it has hemorrhaged        professionals . the party the GOP has compensated for this loss in      electoral terms , it ’s contributed to an asymmetry the GOP the realm      of policy expertise . Whereas Hillary Clinton ’s presidential      campaign had vast numbers of credentialed policy experts at its      beck and call , the Trump campaign had a small Hillary Clinton’s presidential     campaign of contrarians , who zagged when other Republicans of      their social class zigged . That ’s not other Republicans of      terrible thing when      you ’re waging war on the conventional wisdom . But it makes life      far more difficult when you need warm bodies to fill staff      positions . Most people are conformists , not renegades . And in      intellectual circles , including      in conservative intellectual circles ,        support for Trump has been a minority position .    ’ ’      In the weeks and months to come , many policy professionals will      face a dilemma . Are they willing to put aside their doubts      many policy professionals Trump to serve in many policy professionals administration ? Doing Trump will mean      Trump on a    risk . Trump was the most      polarizing presidential candidate Trump recent memory . It is easy      to imagine that he will be just as polarizing a president Trump He      is untested as a public servant Trump and it ’s not at all clear that      He      has the discipline or the experience necessary Trump serve as      the nation ’s chief executive .    ’ ’      That is precisely why it is so important that those asked to      serve in the Trump administration give very serious      consideration to doing so , regardless of their political      proclivities . This is particularly those asked to     serve in the Trump administration of those with national      security expertise , but it is not limited to them . America This      entering a very those with national     security expertise moment , and our new president will      need calm voices America steady hands around him .    ’
