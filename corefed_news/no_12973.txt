Novelist and cultural commentator Bret Easton Ellis delivered a brutal monologue on Bret Easton Ellis podcast this week about    " social justice warriors "   —    or , as the author prefers to call them , the " authoritarian language police " who adhere to a " strict set of little rules and manufactured outrage , demanding apologies from every sandwich or salad you did n’t like . " [ The     author ’s rant begins with a scathing rebuke of a recent LA Weekly profile of singer Sky Ferreira , and cascades into an    condemnation of    social justice    and the harmful culture of political correctness .   A transcript of Ellis’ controversial podcast is below , courtesy of The Independent . The full episode can be listened to in full here . ( Warning : Strong Language ) " In an appreciation of the hot young singer Sky Ferreira that the LA Weekly posted a week ago , the writer Art Tavana wrote , quote : " Sky Ferreira has a name that reads like a    Italian sports car , or the kindred spirit to      pop star Madonna , the most ambitious woman to ever wear a pink cone bra . Both Sky and Madonna have similar breasts in both cup size and ability to cause a shitstorm . " When Ferreira dropped her debut , Night Time , My Time , three years ago , the    album cover nearly broke the internet . Misogynists claimed it was a desperate attempt to sell records feminists saw it as the calculated move of a defiant young woman . A third unnamed group , that included me , could n’t help but reminisce on the past , on Madonna ’s defiantly atomic boobs   —    the two knockers that altered the course of human history . THE B. E. E. PODCAST : Karyn Kusama , Brian De Palma , objectifying Sky Ferreira , Beatty ’s beauty https :   .   pic . twitter .    —    Bret Easton Ellis ( @BretEastonEllis ) July 12 , 2016 ,   " In the    photo , taken by the Argentinian filmmaker Gaspar Noé , Ferreira looks like a dirtier Madonna : square jaw , strong eyebrows , lulled green eyes , crucifix ,    hair , translucently pale skin and killer tits . America ’s already established that Ferreira looks a lot like Madonna , but America almost never have the audacity to admit that Madonna looks offer the most appeal to the American consumer . To pretend looks do n’t matter in pop music is ridiculous . Looks matter , they always will . " Unquote . Tavana goes on to write how Ferreira has moved past this idea . Quote : " She ’s too nasty to be anyone ’s schoolgirl fantasy . She looks like an unvarnished Madonna styled by Maripol , with the vaguely mystical presence of Nico and the    of a Sex Pistols groupie . In other words , Ferreira is the most deliberately    example of a modern pop star . She She not a mindless product like Britney , or a depressed indie pop singer like Lorde , but she She also not bitter or punk , like Meredith Graves , or a feminist superhero like Grimes . She She the pop star who ’s so personally cool that her She label , Capital , does n’t need to hire a team to mold her She " Unquote . Tavana goes on to praise Ferreira as a fashion icon , an accomplished actress he Tavana about how she She hated by the elitist snobs in the indie scene , and decried by feminists when she She to condemn the notorious and accused misogynist    Terry Richardson , and most importantly that she She never let her She history of sexual abuse define her She Compare Ferreira Ferreira Facebook post about this to the    letter the recent Stanford rape victim penned , and you will see two very different takes by young women who have suffered sexual abuse and who are the same age . Tavana goes on to write about how pop stars profit off their beauty Tavana the sexual allure that attracts fans , and I remember clearly many guys in my high school who were not particularly interested in new wave , but when Blondie came around they were clearly many guys in my high school who were not particularly interested in new wave drooling over Deborah Harry , and they started clearly many guys in my high school who were not particularly interested in new wave the Eagles and Foreigner and became fans , and the same with Patty Smyth and Scandal , as well as Suzanna Hoffs and the Bangles   …     it went on and on . But this ‘ ’ goes back to Elvis and the Beatles , with cute    John and Paul and Ringo and George , sold by their adorableness at first . Throw in Mick Jagger and Jim Morrison and Sting and every single boy band that ever existed and   …     it ’s still not the same . Because our gender differences about looking and appropriating is not a narrative about equality and inclusivity . Women get looked at and appropriated a lot more than vica versa , granted , but I think in this era driven by the dreaded idea of ‘ inclusivity for everyone no matter what’ beauty seems threatening   —    a separator , a divider   —    instead of just a natural thing , the natural thing being people who are admired and desired for their looks Women individuals stepping away from the herd and being worshipped for their physical Women . For many of us , this is a reminder of our own us inadequacies in the face of what our culture us as sexy , beautiful , hot   —    be it straight or gay   —    and yes , little snowflakes , boys will be boys . To pretend that looks or that hotness , whether you ’re a guy or a girl , should n’t make you popular , is one of those sad politically correct stances that make you question the validity , the reality of politically correct thinking , and a few journalistic reactions to the LA Weekly piece . This ode to Sky Ferreira may not have been that well written , but it is This ode to Sky Ferreira written honestly by , yes , most definitely a man , who is , yes , most definitely looking at a woman he desires , and writing about that desire . What ’s wrong with that ? Even if it overshadows what he thinks he her music , so what if he ’s he about objectifying her ? her , clearly you did n’t think the little snowflake justice warriors everywhere , from the LAist to Flavorwire to Jezebel to Teen Vogueto Vulture , were going to let this innocuous piece go unnoticed without having a hissy fit ? Oh yes , most deliciously , the little snowflakes got so pissed off and were just sooo unbelievably offended by this piece this innocuous piece they had to denounce it . Oh this innocuous piece little snowflakes , when did you all become grandmothers and society matrons , clutching your pearls in horror at someone who has an opinion about something , a way of expressing themselves that ’s they the mirror image of yours , you snivelling little    narcissists ? The high moral tone from social justice warriors is always out of scale with what they are indignant social justice warriors . When did this hideous and probably    way of living begin transforming you into the authoritarian language police , with your strict set of little rules and manufactured outrage , demanding apologies from every sandwich or salad you did n’t like ? Teen Vogue , of course , found the use of " boobs " and " knockers " as yes , " misogynistic " and started a very tired complaint about ‘ the male gaze’   —    that ’s      listeners . When I hear    feminists complaining about the male gaze yet again and hoping that it will         what , go away ? be rerouted , contained ?   —    I ’m thinking , are these women so deluded that they are bordering these women insanity , or have they just not these women laid in the last four years ? The writer piping up in Teen Vogue about the insensitive misogyny of the Ferreira piece , and how women need to be respected and not judged by their looks   women    and yes , the irony is delicious coming from Teen Vogue   Teen Vogue seemed so childish along with all the idiots tweeting out their hate , that Tavana    " reduced a woman ’s art to whether you want to fuck her or not , you ’re trash " is indicative of the moment we are in . And there is the suggestion that maybe Tavana knew exactly what he was doing , Tavana feminist hysteria , seeing if SJWs would take the bait   —    they always do   the bait      and I kept thinking , what if all I wanna do is bang Nick Jonas ? And I could probably write a 1500 word ode to him , talking about Tavana sexy chest and Tavana ass without really Tavana his music at all Tavana that gon na be a diss on Nick ? Or , if a woman wants to write about how she really hates Drake a woman music , but finds him so physically sexy Drake desirable that she ’s lusting for Drake from him ? Where would Drake put her ? Would either Drake those cases raise an eyebrow ? No . Because , in our society , social justice warriors always prefer women to be victims . In all of these cases , from Jezebel to Flavorwire to Teen Vogue , they all succeeded in recasting Ferreira as a victim of something , reinforcing her supposed victimisation . Jezebel is the usual hall of mirrors loop they find themselves in when they they looking for they to get angry with . The reality of the world is that men look at women , and men look at other men , and women look at other men , and women especially look at other women and objectify them . Has anybody other women on Tinder lately , and seen how our Darwinian impulses are gratified in a swipe or two ? This is the way of the world in order the world species to survive , and I doubt that is ever going to be erased . Now , I know this fake LA Weekly LA Weekly going to go away in about two minutes   —    and yes , everyone can have their deluded social justice warrior opinion everyone the case , which was actually brought to my attention by my favourite     millennial fan who was disgusted by what he saw as a misguided and pompous feminist reaction to the Tavana piece . And we both thought : in a perfect world , Sky would come out in favour of the LA Weekly ‘ LA Weekly would n’t that be so gratifying ? And yes , snowflakes and little wussies , it was a thinkpiece . When did Generation Wuss start becoming outraged over an   ? That ’s the real question . But because the little Nazis policing language have a new rulebook about how men and women should and should not express themselves about their desires , this allows men and women and men and women to write their own childish responses , placing Sky men and women the delicious position of victim Sky But the sad ending of this story is that the LA Weekly , which edited and posted the piece , felt like they had to apologise for the piece men and women so much online complaining the piece about a piece where someone was clearly writing honestly   —    sometimes embarrassingly so   —    about what was on his mind in the moment about a performer someone and the way he was looking , and yes , gazing someone this performer , and that was it . a performer allowable . The overreaction epidemic that is endemic in the culture , and the implicit calling for censorship by removing the piece , is what should not be the piece and it should be called out every time SJWs ignore the piece First Amendment . And I say overreaction because I ca n’t really really imagine Jezebel , who kind of admitted as much , or Flavorwire , giving two shits over this , a thinkpiece on why a man thinks Sky Ferreira hot , instead of just raging in the vacuum of their own making , and the LA Weekly should have pushed LA Weekly this the LA Weekly writer   —    and by extension freedom of expression   —    their just walked away . But no , they felt they needed to say ‘ I ’m sowwy’ to all the snowflakes their found their innocuous piece so offensive and threatening this innocuous piece it crossed some imaginary line of decency , and this innocuous piece all the crybabies who wanted the post taken down , and kudos to the LA Weekly for not taking it down , because if it had the LA Weekly been actual censorship , this innocuous piece is what the left ’s social justice warriors really want . Why is it once again that I feel the    young liberal    feminist left has become so oversensitive about everything that we have entered into what is really an authoritarian cultural moment ? It just seems that it ’s so regressive and so grim and so unreal , like in some dystopian    movie : there ’s only one way to express yourself as some kind of neutered thing , this mound , this clump , turning away from your    responses   —    towards women , towards men , towards sex . This neutering , this castration , is something    really wants or believes in , I hope . But hey , maybe if I go with it and pretend to believe it , it ’ll fill my column   —    and I do need to put out some it this it .
