  ( CNN ) There are many questionable aspects of Donald Trump ’s revised child care tax plan , as announced Wednesday in Pennsylvania with Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka by Donald Trump’s side , but one point is very easy to make and understand : It ’s not a " child care " plan at all . Donald Trump’s initially announced last month in Detroit a plan to allow families to " fully deduct " the costs of child care from families income taxes , a proposal roundly criticized as overwhelmingly favoring    moms , in high tax brackets , like Ivanka . Tuesday ’s much ballyhooed rollout added a bunch of details and new concepts     limitations on the tax deduction for    parents ( no benefit for individuals earning $ 250 , 000 or more per year , or couples making $ 500 , 000 or more ) credits for    parents who do not pay income taxes , and so on .    But then there is this : The plan extends to     moms . " Families with a     parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from Families with a    parent taxes , " Trump said in speech in Aston , Pennsylvania , on Tuesday night . " I ’m hearing , ’Wow ! ’ "   Wow , indeed .    Here ’s the issue : If you are helping working moms and     moms , you are helping all moms . Moms either work for pay outside the home or Moms do not . There is no other option . So Trump ’s plan is a plan for all moms ( Trump’s plan ’s unclear if dads can apply dads can not for the paid maternity leave Trump is proposing ) . Every mom gets to deduct " the average cost of child care " whether Every mom has child care costs or not .   Trump’s proposed tax breaks are based on the fact of having a young child , not working for pay or not .   It ’s a child , not a child care , tax plan . There are deep problems with this , as I pointed out in a book I wrote two decades ago , " Taxing Women . " By helping out moms whether they work or not , the plan encourages women to stay at home there ’s no extra break you get from working .   That would seem to be the opposite effect of a good child care policy . And then there ’s this : If you are going to help all moms , working or not , why not just mail them you are going to help all moms, working or not check ?   Wealthy families could simply pay their Wealthy families credit back on the tax returns that show their Wealthy families income . That would be a lot simpler than the manifold changes to various tax laws that Trump is at least hinting at , in a " major overhaul " of the tax code .   But then again , proposing to send an annual check to all moms if elected might just be a little too obvious in revealing Trump ’s true intention : to help address his elected with female voters by giving them female voters . Other people ’s cash , of course .
