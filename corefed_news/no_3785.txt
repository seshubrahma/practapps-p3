President Donald Trump ’s announcement that President Donald Trump is launching a commission to investigate " election integrity " was only hours old before a politics professor at Rutgers University began organizing educators to " resist " the effort . [ On Thursday , the White House announced that President Donald Trump would sign an executive order creating the a commission to investigate "election integrity" charging it with a commission to investigate "election integrity" the 2016 election to determine if there was any widespread vote fraud or vote suppression . The commission a commission to investigate "election integrity" be headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach , the White House the White House " The Commission will a commission to investigate "election integrity" and practices that enhance or undermine the American people ’s confidence in the integrity of Federal elections , " a White House official reportedly told the the White House . " This will include reviewing laws and activities that lead to improper registrations , improper voting , fraudulent registrations , fraudulent voting , and voting suppression . " The commission would serve a commission to investigate "election integrity" another one of Trump ’s campaign promises to root out voter fraud . Just after his election , for instance , Trump said he would launch a " major Trump " Trump illegal voting . I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD , including those registered to vote in two states , those who are illegal and   …     .   —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) January 25 , 2017 ,   even , those registered to vote who are dead ( and many for a long time ) . Depending on results , we will strengthen up voting procedures !   —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) January 25 , 2017 ,   But the news of the new commission had barely been reported when a Rutgers political science professor began organizing her " resistance " to the effort to a Rutgers political science professor voter fraud . Lorraine Carol Minnite , a professor of political science , as well as an associate professor of public policy at Rutgers    jumped to an educators listserve to Rutgers participation of professors , teachers , and educrats across the country to oppose Trump ’s commission . The message , also circulated by Rick Hasen , a leader in urging academics to oppose any election integrity projects , called on the education community to " resist participation " in the commission . If the President does indeed create a commission to study voter fraud and voter suppression in the American election system to be headed by the Vice Preisdent [ sic ] and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach , I ’m calling on scholars of election administration to resist participation of any kind in such an effort . We should expect a    Commission to find " evidence " of rampant voter fraud across the U. S. and to recommend proposals to amend the Voting Rights Act and the National Voter Registration Act to require     to register and a national voter ID requirement , among other changes that will be damaging to voting rights and therefore , damaging to democracy . Not only did the Rutgers prof urge educators to turn their back on Trump ’s commission , but she educators on to propose they create their own Trump group to present alternate educators to educators ’s effort . I am proposing a Commission Trump’s and voting rights advocates to gather information to inform the public . Such a commission ( or a working group of some kind ) does not need the participation of partisan luminaries or politicians for credibility . With the assault on democracy underway , the most important divide is not between Democrats and Republicans , it is between lies and the truth , and democracy the most important divide authoritarianism . Please email me if you would like to be involved in organizing a non ( not   ) partisan commission on voter fraud and voter suppression to offer evidence , facts and analysis that the public will need to sort through what we can anticipate will come out of a    Commission . Minnite did not outline how this group might be " nonpartisan " when so few conservatives or even Republicans work in the field of education . Responding to Professor Minnite ’s proposition , a spokesperson for the Public Minnite said , " The ink is n’t even on the paper yet and the # Resistance movement is already having fits . Why ? Because the organized left is losing territory it , for generations , has lorded over with an almost perfect the organized left . Tinkering with election rules is a final safe harbor for a partisan entity that has lost on ideas and finds itself in the political wilderness . This is how the left acts a final safe harbor for a partisan entity that has lost on ideas and finds itself in the political wilderness you play in their sandbox .
