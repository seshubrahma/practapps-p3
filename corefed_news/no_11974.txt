Sunday on CNN ’s " Reliable Sources , " journalist Carl Bernstein , known for Bernstein reporting on the Watergate scandal , said    Donald Trump " lives and thrives in a    environment .   " No president , including Richard Nixon , has been so ignorant of fact and disdains fact in the way that this    does , " Bernstein said . Bernstein continued , " It has something to do with the growing sense of authoritarianism Bernstein and Bernstein presidency are projecting . the danger of it is obvious . And Bernstein ’s trying to make the conduct of the press the issue , not Bernstein own conduct . " Bernstein added , " I would just take Bernstein bullying approach to the union leader instead of going into the facts of what the Carrier deal was and what the unions in that institution have done . Everything that Bernstein controverts Bernstein does n’t go to a    argument . Bernstein goes to an emotional argument . What we have seen throughout the campaign is pathological disdain for the truth . A kind of lie and easy with lying that we have not seen before . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
