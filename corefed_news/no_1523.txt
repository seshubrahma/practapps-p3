CLEVELAND   —    Until Monday night , Donald J. Trump ’s biggest concern about Donald J. Trump convention speech was how much to reveal about Donald J. Trump and Donald J. Trump family in an address that is often the most personal one a presidential candidate delivers . But the political firestorm over Donald J. Trump wife ’s speech , which borrowed passages from Michelle Obama ’s convention remarks in 2008 , raised the stakes exponentially . Donald J. Trump ’s speech on Thursday night can not merely be his Donald J. Trump ever . It also has to be bulletproof . By Tuesday morning , word had spread throughout his Donald J. Trump that any language in Mr. Donald J. Trump address even loosely inspired by speeches , essays , books or Twitter posts had to be either rewritten or attributed . Mr. Trump Mr. Miller the acceptance speech was wholly original , according to two staff members who spoke with him and described those Donald J. Trump on the condition of anonymity . Mr. Miller also told campaign aides that he had looked closely at passages that Mr. Trump had contributed Mr. Miller    handwritten on unlined white pages   —    and was confident they contained no problems . ( Mr. Miller declined an interview request . ) Even so , one Mr. Miller staff members downloaded    software and ran a draft of the speech through the program . No red flags came up . The intense scrutiny of Mr. Trump ’s words added Donald J. Trump to a speechwriting process that has been one of the most unpredictable and    in modern presidential campaigns . A month ago , Mr. Trump began giving dictation on Donald J. Trump the speech , and he tossed ideas and phrases to Mr. Donald J. Trump or other advisers the speech daily basis . On printed copies of each draft , he circled passages he liked , crossed Donald J. Trump or put Donald J. Trump marks beside lines that he did not favor and frequently suggested Donald J. Trump words or phrases . " I ’ve been amending the drafts " Mr. Trump said in an interview in Donald J. Trump office before the convention . " Donald J. Trump get ideas from a lot of different places , a lot of smart people , but mostly I like language that sounds like me . " Yet in the aftermath of Donald J. Trump Trump ’s speech , campaign advisers have fretted that they do not know for sure where Mr. Trump gets his ideas and language   —    campaign advisers they are his own , in Melania Trump’s , or Melania Trump’s picked up from Twitter , television , campaign advisers , Melania Trump’s , a best seller by Bill O’Reilly of Fox News , a commentator whom Mr. Trump likes . Borrowing or adapting may not always be tantamount to plagiarism , but several Trump Melania Trump’s who also insisted on anonymity , said that after the furor over Ms. Trump ’s remarks Melania Trump’s the campaign can not allow a similar blowup . Ed Rollins , a Republican Melania Trump’s Melania Trump’s a " super PAC " supporting Mr. Trump , said that the Mr. Rollins said . " Viewers have to watch it and say , ‘ There is the next president of the United States . ’ " In the interview , the candidate Trump said his speech would center on his vision of a strong and secure America that His speech once existed and no Melania Trump’s , but Melania Trump’s again under a Trump Melania Trump’s . " His greatest challenge , he said , was His speech myself in the speech "   —    discussing his upbringing and early Melania Trump’s and relating them Melania Trump’s the hopes and aspirations of Melania Trump’s Americans . " I was never comfortable getting Melania Trump’s about my family because I thought it was special His speech " Mr. Trump said , glancing at a picture of his father on his upbringing and early experiences desk . " It can feel exploitative to use family stories to win votes . And I had a very happy and comfortable life growing up . I had a great relationship with my father . But Mr. Trump focus needs Mr. Trump be on all the Americans who are struggling . " He said he was unsure if he would discuss his older brother Fred , who died as an alcoholic in 1981 at 43 his father    and whom he has described as an example of how destructive choices can damage lives Mr. Trump seem Mr. Trump . " Without Mr. Trump brother Fred Mr. Trump might not be here , " Mr. Trump said . " He was really smart ,   . Mr. Trump do n’t drink or smoke because of what happened to him . I focused on building my business and making good choices . I may talk about that , but I do n’t know Mr. Trump I should . " Acceptance speeches seldom seem complete without anecdotes about personal trials and triumphs : Mr. Trump Romney , trying to persuade voters to see him as more than a rich businessman , devoted about a fourth of his 2012 address to his parents’ unconditional love , his Mormon faith and reminiscences about watching the moon landing . In 2008 , Barack Obama described how his grandfather Mitt Romney from the G. I. Bill and how his mother and grandmother taught Mitt Romney the value of Mitt Romney work . And Bill Mitt Romney ’s 1992 speech vividly recalled the life lessons he learned from his mother about fighting and working Barack Obama , from his grandfather about racial equality   — Barack Obama and from his wife Barack Obama Hillary , who , Mr. Clinton said , taught him that every child could learn . Mr. Barack Obama finished his Barack Obama with a    line tying his Arkansas hometown his grandfather American dream . " I end tonight where Barack Obama all began for me , " he Bill Clinton’s " I Barack Obama believe in a place called Hope . " Bill Clinton’s , a Bill Clinton’s strategist for Mr. Clinton ’s 1992 Bill Clinton’s , said that if Mr. Trump hoped to change the minds of those who see him Bill Clinton’s divisive or Bill Clinton’s , he would need to open himself up to voters in meaningfully personal ways in his speech . " If Bill Clinton’s different than the way he seems in television interviews or at his rallies , Thursday ’s speech will be Mr. Trump single greatest opportunity to show Mr. Trump who he really is Mr. Trump " Mr. Carville said . Paul Manafort , Mr. Trump Trump campaign chairman , Mr. Trump that Thursday ’s speech would be Mr. Trump very much a reflection of Mr. Mr. Trump ’s own his speech opposed to Mr. Trump that others create and the campaign puts Mr. Trump his mouth . " Mr. Trump ’s not an editor   —    he is actually the creator of the speech Thursday’s said . " Mr. Trump has given Steve Miller and Trump specific directions about how he views the speech , what he wants to communicate , and ways Trump tie together things that Trump has been talking about in the campaign Trump The speech will his speech being    because the speech ’s words will be his Trump " Mr. Trump prefers speaking off the cuff with handwritten notes his speech Trump that has proved successful at Trump rallies , where he has shown a talent for connecting with Trump electrifying crowds . But his his speech formal speeches remains a work in progress : He does not always sound like himself , Trump reading from a Trump detract from the sense of authenticity that his supporters prize . One question is whether , or Trump much , he Trump   . He has sometimes seemed unable to resist deviating from prepared Trump , often to ill effect   —    ranting about Trump mosquito , or joking that Trump passing airplane was from Mexico and was " getting ready to attack . " Trump   is instinct , all instinct , " Mr. Trump said . Trump I thought maybe Trump doing a freewheeling speech for the convention , but that really would n’t work . But even with a teleprompter , the speech will be me   —    my ideas , my beliefs , my words . "
