In this brief cessation of hostilities between enemy forces on both sides of the political divide , it is a good time to take stock of where primary voters have taken the two parties . [ Real estate magnate and political neophyte Donald Trump is on the cusp of truly revolutionizing the Republican Party . Donald Trump has slain the establishment GOP and awakened    voters dissatisfied with everything Washington and    politicians have been up to for decades .   Over halfway through the nomination process , Donald Trump stands to walk into the Republican Convention in Cleveland with a sizable plurality   —    if not an outright majority   —    of votes from primary voters . It will be his Donald Trump priority to unify the party around him Donald Trump the new king of the Grand Old Party . Across the aisle , Washington ’s longtime political gadfly , Sen. Bernard Sanders , is on fire with elite Democratic voters . By that , of course , we mean elderly white professors , united with     young " progressives . " And by " progressive , " of course , we mean those who support utterly regressive totalitarian regimes led by great " progressives " such as Josef Stalin , Mao Zedong , and Che Guevara . Funnily enough , Mr. Sanders insists on describing himself Mr. Sanders a " democratic socialist . " Why he Mr. Sanders on repeating himself Mr. Sanders can not tell you . Anyway , the media is all agog over finding comparisons between the Mr. Trump and Mr. Mr. Sanders It is true , both candidates have their highly both candidates supporters . But that should hardly be unique in politics . Only the rarest of political candidates are able to inspire the kind of apathy spawned by Mitt Romney , Jeb ! Bush and Hillary Clinton . Also , supporters of both Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders Mr. Sanders few policy positions such as distrust of global trade . But even in that , there are differences . Trump supporters lament the loss of jobs they would like Trump supporters work while Sanders supporters have Mr. Sanders actually worked a job outside of academia or maybe as a    barista at the campus Starbucks . The truth is , Mr. Trump and Mr. Trump different from one another . Mr. Trump ’s entire campaign is that of a highly disruptive outsider . Sure , he is not the conservative firebrand many Republicans Mr. Trump like . But , really , who can you most likely imagine actually abolishing the federal Department of Education and firing all those bureaucrats ? And every new day , Mr. Trump shocks the Washington political garden party Mr. Trump that , yes , he really does intended to build that wall and Mr. Trump no , he is not kidding when he says Mexico will Mr. Trump for it . Mr. Mr. Trump , meanwhile , is a that wall entrenched barnacle of the Washington establishment and federal bureaucracy . He has , Washington I checked , been in Mr. Sanders for 573 years , first as a member of the House and now the Senate . His greatest ( only ) accomplishment was " reforming Mr. Sanders the Veterans Affairs Department . Truly , its never been the same ever since . Just the Veterans Affairs Department any wounded vet how great that bureaucratic overhaul by the King of Bureaucracy has worked out . I can think of another 2 , 000 vets you might ask , but they have all committed suicide waiting for the VA another 2, 000 vets you might ask help them .
