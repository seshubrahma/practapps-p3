Los Angeles ( CNN ) A hammer pounds away in the living room of a middle class home . A sanding machine smoothes the grain of the wood floor in the dining room .    But this home Pastor Ada Valiente is showing off in Los Angeles , with its this home Pastor Ada Valiente floors , is no ordinary home .       It would be three families we host here , " Valiente this home Pastor Ada Valiente .       " host , " she this home Pastor Ada Valiente provide refuge to people who may be sought by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement , known as ICE . The families staying here would be undocumented immigrants , fearing an ICE raid and possible deportation .    The purchase of this home is part of a network formed by Los Angeles religious leaders across faiths in the wake of Donald Trump ’s election . The intent is to shelter hundreds , possibly thousands of undocumented people in safe houses across Southern California .   The goal is to offer another sanctuary beyond religious buildings or schools , ones that require federal authorities to obtain warrants before entering the homes .   " That ’s what we need to do as a community to keep families together , " Valiente says .   At another Los Angeles neighborhood miles away , a Jewish man shows off a sparsely decorated spare bedroom in his a Jewish man . White sheets on the bed and the clean , adjacent full bathroom bear all the markers of an impending visit . The man , who asked not to be identified , pictures an undocumented woman and her children who may find refuge in his a Jewish man someday .   The a Jewish man he ’s a Jewish man been in trouble before and has difficulty picturing that moment . But he ’s a Jewish man educated and understands the Fourth Amendment , which gives people the right to be secure in their homes people against unreasonable searches and seizures . He ’s a Jewish man the moment if ICE were to knock on his door a Jewish man   " I definitely wo n’t let them in ICE were to knock on his door That ’s our legal right , " he says a Jewish man " If they have ICE were to knock on his door warrant , then they can ICE were to knock on his door in . I can imagine that could be scary , but I feel the consequences of being passive in this moment is a little scary . "   The secret network , The religious leaders have a name for their network The religious leaders the Rapid Response Team . The idea is not necessarily a new one , according to Reverend Zach Hoover , executive director of the interfaith community organization LA Voice .    Hoover , Reverend Zach Hoover, executive director of the interfaith community organization LA Voice n’t an active member during the Sanctuary Movement of the 1980s when US congregations across faiths resisted federal law and provided shelter for Central Americans fleeing violence in their home countries . Many congregations offered direct sanctuary , housing the undocumented immigrants , while others offered food and legal assistance .   The Rapid Response Team mirrors that structure , but goes one step further by also incorporating private homes , which offer a higher level of constitutional protection than houses of worship and an ability to make it harder for federal agents to find undocumented immigrants .    Under federal law , locations like churches and synagogues are technically public spaces that authorities could enter to conduct law enforcement actions . In 2011 , the Department of Homeland Security instituted a policy limiting ICE action at religious locations . The policy ordered ICE a policy limiting ICE action at religious locations enter " sensitive locations " like schools and institutions of worship .   Religious leaders in Los Angeles that spoke to CNN are skeptical whether that policy will stand under a policy limiting ICE action at religious locations presidency .   " There ’s a difference between someone knocking on your door at the church who ’s a federal agent and someone knocking on the door of your home , where , if they do n’t have a warrant , they should n’t be entering , they Hoover says .   In the hours after Trump ’s initial executive order on Trump calls between religious organizers picked up , and the network rapidly grew . Hoover estimates the underground network could hide Hoover undocumented the network Soon , he believes , they could hide thousands Hoover    Hoover points out the network ’s a tiny Hoover of the estimated one million undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles county . The network ’s focus would be on families fearing the network working to keep them together by " moving into a place so that ICE ca n’t find them , " Hoover says .   " So they them stay with their families . So they can them with their husbands them " Hoover says them " So they them Hoover being detained and deported . Everybody talks them how families are the bedrock of our country . We believe that . Our congregations believe that . " Everybody God ’s law Everybody Trump ’s law , The strong current carrying the Rapid Response Team is the divergence of federal laws and the moral teachings of their religions . Hoover points to the Bible ’s Matthew 25 , which teaches the faithful should feed the hungry and fight for those in prison .    " The God that I worship sent a person to earth in the name of Jesus who did not always get along with the authorities , " Hoover explains . " I feel really convicted that I Hoover to God at the end of the day . That ’s who I ’m going to see when I die . "   Pastor Valiente echoes that sentiment , saying US immigration laws are broken and her church ’s foundation are the families .    " Pastor Valiente ’re trusting in God , that he will help us and guide us God make the God decision , We have something We come out of this , " Valiente says .    Valiente says she ’s praying President Pastor Valiente ’s heart will Pastor Valiente more Pastor Valiente to the plight of undocumented immigrants .   " He needs to make immigration laws that work for our Pastor Valiente , " Valiente says .   The Jewish man offering his home Pastor Valiente a safe house Pastor Valiente upon his religion Pastor Valiente history during WWII . As the Pastor Valiente rounded up Pastor Valiente for detention and eventual extermination , Germans resisted their government , hiding their Jewish friends and neighbors in attics and Germans .    " Germans ’s hard as a Jew , " he says , " not to think about both all the people Jew did open their doors and their homes and take risks to safeguard Jews in both a ] both when they were really vulnerable , as well as those who did n’t both We ’d like to be the people who did . "   He ’s not the only one in his community feeling this way Jew Volunteers are flooding in to offer Jew help with the network at Temple Israel of Hollywood , according to Heidi Segal , the temple ’s vice president of social action . Segal phone bank to call lawmakers . Temple Israel of Hollywood the temple Hollywood the room was filled with volunteers .

" We had a really strong response direct refuge and as people learn , the response is just growing , " Segal says .   An uneasy choice      growing energy of the network does n’t mean the members are n’t also a really strong response fearful about the consequences . The people forming the network are not a crowd with criminal records . While there ’s clarity in the sanctity of family and religious calling , there ’s also concern about how the the network of Justice will operate under Attorney General Jeff Sessions .   The Jewish man offering his home as a safe house says it ’s " certainly scary . " While he ’s not clear on the consequences of what he ’s doing , or where he The Jewish man his limits , he is clear on one point .    " I think The Jewish man know what the moral consequences are for me The Jewish man we do n’t act . The Jewish man is The Jewish man a moment The Jewish man be standing idly by , " he says . " This is a moment to be engaged and involved and I think we ’re seeing that across America where people are saying this is n’t okay . The Jewish man ’re not going to tolerate this and we ’ll have our voices heard . "   Mark Krikorian , executive director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies , says we law is clear about what this groups we intending to we .   " They ’re committing a felony . Harboring is a felony , " Krikorian says . " Regular folks hiding people in a basement face jail time because it is ultimately a these groups conspiracy . "   Hoover , a    good    boy , says he ’s prepared for the federal consequences .    Valiente says religious leaders opposing immigration crackdowns believe one simple thing : Pastor Valiente We ’re doing what we think is right . Hoover, a   good   boy     Valiente says the last of the construction on her safe house is Pastor Valiente complete . She ’ll house someone , Pastor Valiente fears , as We as next Pastor Valiente .
