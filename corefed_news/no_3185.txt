During an interview on CNN on Tuesday , Senator Ted Cruz ( ) stated that the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court is a " home run . "   Senator Ted Cruz said , " During the campaign , Senator Ted Cruz promised the American people that Senator Ted Cruz would nominate a principled constitutionalist to replace Justice Scalia , and tonight President Trump honored that commitment .    …      I think Judge Neil Gorsuch is a home run . He Judge Neil Gorsuch a decade of proven experience on the court of appeals of being faithful to the Constitution , following the law , protecting the Bill of Rights and our fundamental liberties , and I think that record will yield a swift confirmation in the United States Senate . " He Judge Neil Gorsuch , " Democrats are engaged right now in unprecedented partisan obstruction , but I hope on the Supreme Court they Democrats not engage in that practice .    …      Democrats will not succeed in filibustering Judge Gorsuch . They Democrats try , but they Democrats not succeed . " Cruz also addressed whether or not blocking Gorsuch filibustering Judge Gorsuch be fair turnabout for blocking the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland by saying the two nominations took place under a " fundamentally different " set of circumstances because Garland Judge Merrick Garland appointed during an election year .
