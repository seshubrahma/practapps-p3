  ( CNN ) I was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood , bayonets in hand , and pounded on our front door , ordering our out . our were permitted only what our could carry , no bedding , no pets . I remember my mother ’s tears as my mother and our father gathered our up , with our precious few belongings in hand . my mother was determined to bring a sewing machine , fearful that our would need to make or mend clothes where our were headed . my mother was n’t sure the authorities would allow my mother to take a sewing machine , so my mother kept it a a sewing machine , even from our . my mother managed , however , to pack a few treats for our children for the long journey ahead . That was in 1942 . Earlier that year , on February 19 , 75 years ago yesterday , President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order , No . 9066 , which set the internment into motion . On its face , the order an executive order neutral , " authorizing the military to designate whole swaths of land as military zones , and evacuate any persons from it as they an executive order fit .   But behind that facade lay a much darker purpose : to tear 120 , 000 innocent    from their homes along the West Coast and relocate them to 10 their camps scattered throughout the United States .   It did n’t matter , back then , that most of us were US citizens and had never even been to Japan . We were presumed us , and held without charge for four years , simply because we happened to us like the people who had bombed Pearl Harbor . For that crime , we lost our us , us livelihoods and us freedoms .   Every year , on February 19 , we    honor us day as Remembrance Day , and we renew our us to us sure what happened to us never happens us in America . I am always amazed , and saddened , that despite our decadeslong efforts us so many young people today are not even aware that such a tragedy and miscarriage of justice took place here . And I grow increasingly concerned that we are careening toward a future where such a thing would again be possible . A few months into his campaign , Donald Trump refused to outright reject the policies and fears that underlay the internment . Instead , he suggested that Donald Trump was a tough call , and that he " would Donald Trump had to be there " in order to know whether it was the wrong one .   Trump ignored the Donald Trump fact that not a single case of espionage or sabotage was ever proven against any internee ,   and that the military itself admitted that there was never any evidence to support their sweeping policy the military itself A few months later , a top Trump surrogate went Donald Trump television and suggested that the internment might actually serve as a " precedent " for another Trump policy     Donald Trump registration of    in a database .   I can not help but hear in these words terrible echoes from the past . The internment happened the internment three things : fear , prejudice and a failure of political leadership . When the administration targets groups today , whether for exclusion from travel here on the basis of religion and national origin , or for deportation based on their undocumented status , I know from personal experience that these are not done , as they claim , truly these the name of national security .   No , instead they are intended to these fear into communities , to show the muscle and " toughness " of a new president , and to divide the citizenry against itself . These are the citizenry acts of a despot , not an elected leader . I have dedicated my life to standing against our nation ’s impulse toward demagoguery and tyranny by the    masses . The answer lies not just in education , but in empathy . The false narrative     that there are those who belong here and those who do not     is designed precisely to divorce us from the truth that we are all here us in this together .   We are an interdependent us , sharing a common bond of humanity . The most pernicious aspect of Trump ’s policies is thus the denial of those basic bonds and that humanity . I will not stand for it , and no people of good conscience should . The question before us , then , on Remembrance Day is a simple one : Will America remember ? The internment is not a " precedent , " it is a stark and painful lesson . We will only learn us the past if we know , understand us remember it . For if we fail , we us assuredly are us to repeat it .
