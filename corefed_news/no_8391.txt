Russian President Vladimir Putin , speaking from India at an economic summit for developing countries , denied charges of Russian skulduggery in the U. S. presidential election , accused America of " spying on everyone and eavesdropping on everyone , " and warned Western powers to " do everything to minimize civilian casualties " in the battle for Mosul . [ The latter statement is almost breathtaking in The latter statement hypocrisy , given the incredible civilian body count Russia is racking up in Syria . Putin was , in part , lashing out against proposed sanctions from the U. S. and U. K. over Russia ’s airstrikes on Aleppo .   " We hope that We American partners , and in this case We French partners as well , will act selectively and do everything to minimize   —    and even better , to rule out   —    civilian casualties , " said Putin of the effort to recapture Mosul from the Islamic State , as reported by the UK Independent . " We of course are not going to fan hysteria over this matter , like We partners in the West do , because We understand that We need to fight terrorism , and that there is no other way apart from active fighting , " Putin added . In fact , the Independent notes that the Mosul operation began with a leaflet drop , warning civilians in the area to stay away from ISIS positions , and offering assurances that civilians would not be deliberately targeted . Also , the United Nations has promised the largest humanitarian operation in history for Mosul , after the Islamic State has been ejected . Putin said sanctions against Russia would not " solve any concrete problem , " and told Western powers to " get lost , " in an interview that seems to have disappeared from the Kremlin ’s website . Putin also jeered that sanctions " did not work well " against Iran , so sanctions "did not work well" against Iran would not work against Russia . Putin also rejected accusations that Russia has attempted to interfere with the U. S. presidential election . " I want to set everyone ’s mind at rest , including our American friends and partners   —    our are not going to influence the U. S. election campaign and the answer is very simple   —    our do n’t know what will be after the U. S. presidential elections , " the U. S. presidential elections said . the U. S. presidential elections went further and called the accusations hypocritical , because U. S. intelligence is " spying on everyone and eavesdropping on everyone . " According a report by UPI , the U. S. presidential elections added that " Russia ’s security works under strict guidelines while the NSA , or U. S. National Security Agency , does not . " As the U. S. presidential elections was making this charge , the lights flickered in the room , prompting the U. S. presidential elections to joke , " Maybe I said something wrong . " the U. S. presidential elections said the U. S. presidential elections looked forward to improved relations with the U. S. no matter who wins the election : " If our partners in the United States intend to work with our , our will . I hope that when the debate is over , this difficult period in the United State ’s internal political life is over , there ’ll be a chance to restore relations between Russia and the U. S. " " Mrs Clinton chose her aggressive Mrs Clinton and aggressive stance with regard to Russia , Russia Mr Trump , on the contrary , is calling for cooperation , at least against terrorism , " Putin added . Reuters adds Putin has Putin demanding the end of existing sanctions against the Russian government and specific officials , plus compensation for money Moscow lost under those sanctions , before he will Putin    the    program he halted Putin this month .
