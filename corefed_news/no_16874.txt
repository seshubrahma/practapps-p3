" I am not advocating a federal program here whatsoever . But if Chicago were to set up clinics that you , as a heroin addict , could come in and get your heroin tested without fear of criminal repercussion , we ’ll test it for you and we ’ll determine whether it we kill you or it . If you are genuinely concerned about reducing or eliminating death due to heroin , that is a program that would definitely do that .
