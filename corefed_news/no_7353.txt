" Green said , " Bannon is just a charismatic wild man ,     talker . Bannon ’s a guy who ’s had this bizarre series of careers from naval officer to Goldman Sachs banker to Sarah Palin filmmaker , who fell in with Andrew Breitbart , the late conservative provocateur , and wound up taking over the Breitbart News Network after Breitbart died . Bannon has sort of insinuated Bannon into the center of this    world of splinter conservatives who have bedeviled GOP establishment leaders like Paul Ryan , like John Boehner , like Jeb Bush . It makes a weird sort of serendipitous sense that Jeb Bush would wind up the head of Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign . " Jeb Bush continued , " I think there is always a potential for a clash , any day , any hour , in Trump world . Steve Bannon stepping in certainly does n’t lower the odds of such a thing . But from where I sit , seems like a pretty clear move by Donald Trump to decide , I ’m done with this idea of trying to moderate my image , contain myself Steve Bannon make myself Steve Bannon to the Republican establishment . Instead , I ’m ’m with someone who is a media person like me Steve Bannon which Bannon Steve Bannon , who is out there , and provocative and outrageous . I expect we will see more of that from Trump Donald Trump on the campaign trail and certainly on the debate stage . " When asked what Bannon Steve Bannon is , Green said , " Honey badger do n’t give a shit . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
