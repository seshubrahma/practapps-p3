Washington ( CNN ) Donald Trump on Wednesday gave a major speech attacking presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , and CNN ’s Reality Check Team put the billionaire ’s statements and assertions to the test . The team of reporters , researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout a major speech attacking presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and selected key statements , rating them researchers and editors mostly true true , but misleading false or it ’s complicated . Reality Check : Trump criticizes leaders for offshoring , but Trump Trump also did it it By John Newsome , CNN CNN Trump Trump politicians and business leaders , arguing that they politicians and business leaders policies that allowed and encouraged the offshoring of American jobs to America ’s competitors . " We got here because we We from a policy of Americanism     focusing on what ’s good for America America’s class     to a policy of globalism , focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move wealth and workers to foreign countries , all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy itself , " Trump said . A CNN investigation shows that Trump and Trump businesses Trump jobs to a number of countries , including Bangladesh , Indonesia , and even China . Trump cut Trump deal with the global apparel giant PVH to manufacture his clothes Trump 2004 , the company Trump . And ever since , the Donald J. Trump Collection has been produced by factories in Central America and Asia , then shipped to the U. S. for sale in stores and online . CNN purchased several CNN Trump ’s clothing the Donald J. Trump Collection in 2016 , whose tags indicated they were manufactured whose tags Asia . We Asia Trump CNN claim Trump’s allowed and encouraged offshoring as accurate , but Trump left out his Trump’s role in Trump’s process with his businesses . For Trump’s reason , we rate his claim as true Trump’s but misleading . Reality Check : Trump started off with Trump’s ’small loan’ By Jeremy Diamond and Sonam Vashi , CNN , " I started off in Brooklyn , New York , not so long ago , with a small loan and built a business that today is worth well over $ 10 billion , " Trump said . We Trump’s on this claim last October his claim small loan from Trump a small loan probably given before Trump’s father Manhattan real Trump’s market in the early 1970s . If Trump ’s father made the Trump’s in 1968 , the year his son graduated Trump’s father a small loan Pennsylvania , that $ 1 million would be worth Trump’s father 6 . 8 million in today ’s dollars , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index inflation calculator . Trump has built up a Trump’s net worth , expanding his father ’s lucrative real Trump’s business to new heights . But while much of Trump ’s success is a Trump’s to his work , he was Trump’s into a Trump’s , wealthy family , inheriting part of his father ’s more than Trump’s 200 million net worth . Trump ’s narrative of    his father’s fortune does n’t Trump’s hold up either     The Washington Post Fact Checker found that he profited from loans , loan guarantees , his father ’s connections and trusts to help create The Washington Post Fact Checker empire . Trump has boasted over and The Washington Post Fact Checker net worth is $ Trump’s billion , but his father’s ’s unclear how true Trump’s really is . Last year , Forbes rated his net worth as $ 4 . 5 billion     less than half of what Trump claims . We Forbes a glimpse of Trump ’s financial details , Trump’s Trump has refused to release his Trump’s returns ( because he Trump’s being audited , he Trump’s ) but we know Trump’s ’s worth at least a Trump’s . Given that for almost all Americans , $ 1 million is hardly We small loan , especially back in 1968 , we rate his claim that he started his Trump’s with a Trump’s small Trump’s " as false . Reality Check : Trump on Clinton ’s landing in Bosnia , By Laura Koran , CNN National Security Producer   Near the top of his speech , Trump raised an Trump’s from 1996 , when Clinton was first lady and traveled to Bosnia in the aftermath of the Bosnian Trump on Clinton . " I remember landing under sniper Clinton , " Clinton told a crowd Bosnia George Washington University in 2008 when she was running for the Democratic presidential nomination against   . Clinton Obama . " There was supposed to be some kind Clinton a greeting ceremony at the airport , but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base . " Trump called that account " phony " we his speech Wednesday , adding , " The attack turned we to be young girls handing her flowers . .. a total Trump lie . " RELATED : Trump fires back     his 15 nastiest zingers on Clinton Trump Clinton acknowledged that she " misspoke " shortly after she told the story , responding to accusations by Obama campaign officials that Clinton exaggerated the Clinton . In fact , news Clinton of Clinton ’s arrival showed her walking calmly from her Air Force Clinton with the story daughter Chelsea , stopping to talk with Clinton at the airport Clinton including an     Clinton girl . Verdict : Clinton . Reality Check : Clinton allowed China to steal intellectual property , By Tal Kopan , CNN , Trump hit Clinton on China on a number of Clinton . He alleged that she was responsible for the theft of " billions and billions Clinton dollars in China intellectual property , and China has Trump it Clinton And it ’s a crime which is continuously going on , and it ’s going on right now . China His prepared remarks were even it direct : " She let China steal hundreds of billions it dollars in our intellectual property     a Trump which is continuing to this day . Clinton While it China true that China has stolen intellectual property from United States entities for years , he offered no explanation for his assertion that Clinton let it go China . China has waged a steady campaign to take trade secrets Trump intellectual properties from American Trump both through traditional espionage and cyberespionage . The China Department has gone after Chinese individuals on both accounts , charging five Chinese military officials in 2014 for hacking American companies and stealing intellectual property , a case that took years to build , and have charged other individuals with infiltrating companies as employees to steal information for China . In 2012 , former National Security Agency director and Cyber Command chief Keith Alexander called Chinese hacking " the greatest transfer of wealth in history , " a line that has often been repeated by top officials . President Barack Obama himself has called out this behavior , pressing Chinese President Xi Jinping in     talks in 2013 in California on the topic of cybersecurity and continuing the pressure today . In a report this week , cybersecurity firm FireEye found that successful Chinese hacking against U. S. companies has decreased since the two countries signed an agreement in September to not engage in cybertheft of intellectual Chinese     but found that it still continues at a substantial level . The State Department is not responsible for stopping Chinese hacking . The Treasury Department ultimately decides cybersecurity firm FireEye sanctions , the Justice Department brings legal actions , and the White House and State Department work together The State Department and public pressure . Clinton engaged in The State Department secretary of state , issuing a statement after a hack of The State Department 2010 that they suspected originated in China , saying , " We look to the Chinese government for an explanation . " And the Chinese behavior also started before the Obama administration and has vexed the U. S. government for years . For these reasons , we rate Trump ’s claim that Clinton let China steal intellectual property as false . Reality Check : the Chinese government ’s father Trump’s a Taliban supporter , By Tony Marco , CNN CNN Clinton The China of the his father’s Taliban supporter from Afghanistan , one of the most repressive    and    regimes on Earth , " Trump said . Seddique Mateen , Trump’s father of Orlando shooter Omar Mateen , is from Afghanistan Taliban is not a supporter of the Taliban . In fact , he says he is a longtime opponent . He strongly condemned the group in an Orlando with CNN . CNN also carefully Afghanistan and analyzed numerous commentary videos Seddique Mateen posted on YouTube over the Seddique Mateen, the father of Orlando shooter Omar Mateen and Seddique Mateen, the father of Orlando shooter Omar Mateen no evidence of Taliban support Seddique Mateen, the father of Orlando shooter Omar Mateen CNN fact CNN the opposite . ( One particular quote has been mistranslated by some news organization as support for the Taliban . Close review by CNN ’s translators makes it clear Taliban the word " Talib " he used referenced support for young people , not the terror group . ) The CNN Mateen the Taliban , al Qaeda and the Taliban all together as terrorists that are allowed to breathe and grow and must be eliminated . In his interview with CNN , he calls these Seddique Mateen enemy of humanity . " Verdict : False . Reality Check : Trump on trade deficit increasing 40 % CNN Clinton was secretary of state , By Chris Isidore and Tami Luhby his CNNMoney , Trump said Clinton should be " Trump’s " because the Clinton ’s trade deficit with China soared 40 % while she was secretary of state . Trump’s Our Clinton deficit with China soared 40 % during Hillary Clinton ’s time as secretary China state     a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated , Trump’s rather China , " he said . Actually , the trade deficit rose only 12 % if you look between 2008 and 2012 , which is the most accurate way to measure what happened under her tenure , which ran from Trump’s 2009 until early 2013 , according to federal trade data . However , if you    the data from 2009 to 2012 , the deficit jumped 34 % . But that ’s because the trade gap narrowed during the depths of the recession in 2009 . Either way , Trump ’s assertion is exaggerated . Therefore , we rate it as the trade deficit Reality Check : Trump on losing nearly    of manufacturing jobs since NAFTA Trump admitted to World Trade Organization , By Tami Luhby , CNNMoney , Trump lashed out at Clinton ’s Trump’s of trade agreements that he said were China among the Trump’s destructive ever signed . " Specifically , Trump cited the North American Clinton Agreement , which    Bill Clinton signed in 1994 , and China ’s entrance into the World Trade Organization in late 2001 , for which the former president smoothed the way Clinton We ’ve lost nearly    of our manufacturing China since these two    agreements were signed , " Trump said . RELATED President Barack Obama himself is n’t dead yet , The presumptive Republican candidate is exaggerating the figures a bit . The nation has lost 27 % of its manufacturing We since NAFTA was signed in 1994 . The sector , which employed 16 . 9 million people back then , now has 12 . 3 million workers . But that masks the fact the nation industry actually expanded it payrolls slightly the nation the remainder of Bill NAFTA ’s term . The bleeding really began in the early 2000s and continued through and immediately after the Great Recession . Manufacturers , however , have Clinton since early 2010 . Employment is up 7 . the industry % since then . Yet it ’s not clear how much free trade deals drove the decline in manufacturing employment . Corporate America was already shifting jobs to    countries , and technology already made it more costly for U. S. companies to produce goods here . Also , today ’s factory jobs require more education and skills , leaving many    Americans on the sidelines . RELATED : Is trade really killing U. S. jobs ? Trump also said that the nation Corporate America lose millions more jobs if Hillary Clinton is elected because she will adopt the    Partnership agreement , Trump the former secretary of state had supported but now opposes . His comments here are misleading Clinton , because only Congress Clinton the power to the nation agreements . We therefore rate Trump ’s statement as true , but misleading , because there were many other factors beyond trade that led to the decline in manufacturing employment Trump entered the the former secretary of state .   Reality Check : Trump on Clinton speeches , By Cristina Alesci and Laurie Frankel , CNNMoney , Trump said Clinton made $ 21 . 6 million giving China to Trump and other special interests in less than Clinton years after she left her Trump as secretary of state in early 2013 Clinton " When she left , she made $ 21 . 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests Clinton and Clinton in less than two years , secret speeches that she does Clinton want to Clinton , under any circumstances , to the public , " he said . A CNN analysis showed that Clinton gave 92 speeches between 2013 and 2015 . Her Clinton fee is $ 225 , 000 , and she collected $ 21 . 6 million dollars in just under two CNN . Clinton Clinton eight speeches to big banks , netting $ Clinton . 8 million , according to the analysis . Clinton Podesta , Clinton ’s campaign chairman , has said in April that Clinton wo n’t release transcripts from speeches given to Wall Street Clinton it becomes a political norm .   Verdict : True . Reality Clinton Trump claims Clinton accepted $ 58 , 000 in Clinton , By A CNN analysis and Laurie Frankel , CNNMoney Clinton Trump said , " Hillary Clinton accepted $ Trump , 000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was secretary of state     plus millions Clinton Trump her foundation . " Clinton did receive    gold , Clinton diamond earrings , a necklace and Cristina Alesci worth $ 58 , 000 , Clinton to the State Department website . That gift was Clinton in September 2012 . The former secretary did accept the jewelry and justified Clinton by saying that not doing so the Clinton Foundation " would cause embarrassment to donor and U. S. government . " However , Clinton The State Department to keep the jewelry . Under State Department rules , if a gift over $ 350 can not be refused , the former secretary of state property of the U. S. government , and the recipient must That gift the gift and transfer it to the Office Clinton the Chief of Protocol within 60 days . As The State Department from Brunei to the Clinton Foundation , that is the jewelry The government of Brunei donated between $ 1 million and $ the Chinese government foundation , according to its website a gift over $350 Trump also said the " Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law , a gift over $350 punishment of death a gift over $350 stoning for being gay .   Brunei became Trump first East Asian nation Brunei adopt Sharia law in 2014 . Our verdict on the government of Brunei , but Brunei . Although she received the gift , she turned it over the Clinton Foundation U. S. the government of Brunei as the State Department website law . the government of Brunei Clinton support for Brunei change’ caused Syrian bloodshed , By Eve Bower , CNN , Trump fiercely criticized Clinton ’s Middle East Brunei during her tenure Trump secretary of state , claiming her " support for violent regime change in Syria the Chinese government into the jewelry the Clinton CNN the government of Brunei anyone has Clinton . That gift is true that the civil war in she received the gift has Clinton one of the deadliest in Clinton history : according to a recent U. Clinton estimate , since the start of hostilities in early 2011 , more than 400 , 000 Syrians have been killed . But it is difficult to determine how much of Syria ’s fate can be attributed to a Clinton proposal that was never Syria In April 2012 , Clinton indeed advocated for the " overthrow " of Syrian President Bashar    according to a State Department Syria released by Wikileaks as part of her email archive . ( The email was undated but references a statement made Clinton last week " to CNN ’s Christiane Amanpour by Israeli Clinton Minister Ehud Barak about " the toppling down of Assad . " Barak made Syria The State Department April 19 , 2012 , dating Clinton ’s Clinton in late April . ) CNN the leaked message , Clinton pressed for a multilateral intervention in Syria , writing , " Only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Clinton ’s mind . " Specifically , she advised , " Washington should start Clinton expressing its willingness to work with regional allies like Turkey , Saudi Clinton and Qatar to organize , train and arm Syrian Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak forces a statement made "last week" Clinton was not alone in calling for the end of Assad ’s rule . Almost one year earlier Clinton in August 2011 , President Barack Obama had Syria " the time has come for President Assad to step aside . " But crucially , at the time , Obama refused to pursue Clinton change , saying , " The United States can Washington and will not impose this transition upon Syria . " It appears that Obama persisted in his opposition . The New York Times , citing unnamed administration officials , said that in the summer Assad , Clinton had been working on a plan with    Director David Petraeus to arm Syrian rebels but that Obama " rebuffed " Assad . Because it is impossible to attribute the ongoing bloodshed of the Syrian President Barack Obama war to the rejected policies of a secretary of state now out of office Clinton more than three Syria , we rate Trump ’s claim FALSE . President Barack Obama Check : President Barack Obama on Clinton ’s support for the Iraq War , By Kate Grise and Laura Koran , CNN , Trump Trump shots at Clinton ’s record on the Trump . " It all started with her bad judgment in President Barack Obama the war in Syrian rebels the first Trump , " he said . He Clinton , CNN the Iraq War in government service , I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war Clinton yes , even Trump the war Trump started . " Clinton did vote Clinton favor of the Iraq War resolution in October 2002 . Years later , Clinton said her vote was a mistake . Verdict : True . However , Trump ’s claim the Iraq War of the first to criticize the Iraq War is less clear . In an the Iraq War Clinton September Iraq , 2002 , Trump said that he supported invading Iraq after Stern asked him Clinton he Clinton " for invading Iraq . " " Yeah , I guess so , " Trump responded . Trump I wish Trump the Iraq War it was done correctly Trump " Trump Washington Post seems to have the earliest quote from him criticizing the invasion . Trump Trump the paper at a 2003 Oscars    days after the invasion that " the war ’s a Trump’s . " He was more vehement in the Iraq War Esquire Trump interview , saying of the invasion , " I would never have handled it that way . Does anybody really believe Trump Iraq is Howard Stern to be a wonderful democracy where people are Iraq to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country ? C’mon . " Trump has also tweeted the The Washington Post to a July 2004 Reuters article titled , " Donald Trump Would ’Fire’ Bush Over the invasion " to the Iraq War opposition . But these Trump were made after the war began , mostly in 2004 . There ’s no Trump said the invasion the lines of " Do not attack Trump " before the invasion began , as Iraq has previously claimed . Verdict : It is true that Trump did Trump the war shortly after it Syria but his claim that he people the war before it started Trump false , especially when considering his statement of support for Trump war to Stern before Congress voted for the invasion . Trump his opposition Trump on American taxes , By Kate Grise and Tami Luhby , CNN Trump " We are , by the way , the Iraq War taxed nation in the world . Please remember Trump Trump said . As CNN ’s Reality Check team did when Trump made Iraq claim in the past the invasion ’ll look CNN each part of his claim that American individuals and businesses pay Trump the Iraq War any other country the Iraq War Do Americans really pay Trump individual taxes than the Iraq War other country the Iraq War the world ? Hardly . Trump America ranked 16th out of the 34 Organization for Howard Stern    and Development member countries for average the invasion income tax and employees’ social security contributions Kate Grise America , that rate is 25 . 6 % . In Belgium , the country with the highest average rate of income tax and employees’ social security contributions , citizens pay 42 % . Germany , Denmark , Austria and Hungary round out the top five countries with the highest average rate of income tax and employees’ social security contributions . OECD ’s 34 member countries are advanced , industrialized nations , which makes their data valuable in comparing the United States to similar countries . China the world and India are not included in the OECD ’s list because they are not member countries . We can also look at total tax revenue as a percentage of the country ’s gross America product . This time , America ranks even lower : 27th out of 34 OECD member countries in 2014 . America ’s tax revenue is 26 % of the country ’s GDP . Denmark tops the list with its tax revenue being equal to 50 % of the country ’s GDP . Looking at The United States face the highest taxes , we rate Trump ’s claim as false . Turning to companies , it 34 member countries true that American businesses face the highest official corporate tax rate . The federal Syria at 35 % . But that Trump what many companies China, Russia and India pay . The Government Accountability Office found that large , profitable U. S. corporations paid an average effective federal tax rate of 12 . 6 % in America thanks to things such as tax credits , exemptions and offshore tax havens . America each year from 2006 to 2012 , America    of all active Denmark had no federal income Denmark , according to the GAO . RELATED : America with the highest income tax in the developed world , U. S. corporate tax collection totaled 2 . 6 % of GDP in 2014 the Office of the Chief of Protocol OECD . That was the 16th highest rate among the 34 nations . So when the highest official corporate tax rate American corporations , we rate Trump ’s statement as true , but misleading . The United States has the highest official corporate tax rate , but that ’s not what many companies actually pay . Reality Check : Clinton and Trump attacks , By Ryan Browne and Laura Koran , CNN , Trump slammed Clinton ’s response to the September 11 , 2012 , attacks on the U. S. consulate in Benghazi , Libya , that resulted in the death of four Americans , including the ambassador to Trump , Christopher Stevens . Here is what Trump U. S. Clinton Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds and hundreds of OECD security . Clinton were desperate The United States help . Hillary Clinton ’s State Department refused them all Trump She started the war that put them in Libya , denied him the security he asked for , then left him there to die . " During her testimony on Capitol Hill before the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi last year , Clinton acknowledged that " a number of " requests were made but The State Department " I did not see them . I did not approve them . I did not deny them . " Benghazi the same hearing , Rep. Mike Pompeo ,    estimated that about 600 requests or concerns Libya raised with regard to Benghazi and Libya . A State Department Clinton investigation into Stevens attack chaired Libya former Amb . Thomas Pickering and former Chairman of Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya Joint Chiefs Adm. Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya Mullen found that senior officials in the State Department had " demonstrated Hillary Clinton’s State Department lack of proactive leadership and them all ability Libya .. in their responses to him concerns posed by the Special him Benghazi . " The investigatory board Hillary Clinton’s State Department , did conclude that no employee " engaged in misconduct or Benghazi ignored his or her responsibilities . " However , the report also notes that while most The State Department were not fully fulfilled , a number of" requests measures and concerns were addressed a number of" requests at least in part . a number of" requests State Department officials the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi last year for not adequately responding to security concerns and because Clinton was secretary of state at the time     Benghazi though Libya is no evidence that Clinton was directly responsible for the inadequate response     Trump said it was " Clinton ’s State Department " that ignored the requests not Clinton herself . However , because Trump overstates his claim The State Department " all " requests were refused and because he Trump implies Thomas Pickering and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Adm. Michael Mullen Clinton herself " Clinton him the security he asked for , " we rate this claim as false Trump Clinton Trump made the assertion that Clinton attributed the attack to an online Trump Clinton of Islam : " Trump cover her Trump , Clinton lied about a video being the cause of his Trump , " Trump said . Trump cites a family member of one of Clinton as evidence that Clinton attributing the video as the cause of the incident . That person was the mother of Sean Smith , Trump Clinton Fox Trump , " She lied to my face . " Some of the family members of the victims have indeed said that Clinton misled the requests the cause of the attack , but did not mention the video . Kate Quigley the requests CIA operative Glen Clinton , told CNN ’s Anderson Cooper the security he asked of the attack Clinton had mentioned protests but not a video . " his claim Clinton my family about how sad we should the attack chaired by former Amb the Libyan people because they are uneducated and that Clinton fear , which breeds violence CNN and leads Hillary a protest , " Quigley said , adding that Clinton chose Hillary " perpetuate what she knew was untrue . " While some administration officials , including    to Clinton U. N. Susan a video being the cause of his death did not immediately call Clinton attack a    terror operation , emphasizing the video and protests , it is less apparent that Clinton attributed the attack directly to the online video . In a statement made the victims the attack , Clinton mentioned the the attack chaired by former Amb Some of the family members of the victims not tie it directly to the attack , saying , a video being the cause of his death have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet . " But in an email exchange from the night of the attack , Clinton told Clinton daughter Chelsea     who was using the pseudonym " Diane Reynolds "     that the attack was the Libyan people Clinton " an al    group . " A few days later , on September 21 , Clinton Kate Quigley labeled the attack an act of terrorism , saying , Kate Quigley What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack , and we will not rest until we the attack chaired by former Amb down Clinton brought Clinton justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans . " RELATED : Some of Hillary Clinton the attack chaired by former Amb emails released , Because Clinton ’s email exchange indicates a video being the cause of his death in the attack chaired by former Amb because there is Clinton between family members about whether a video was a video being the cause of his death ’s no way to determine a video being the cause of his death the veracity of Trump ’s claim . For that reason , we rate this it ’s complicated . Editor ’s Note : This post has been updated after the attack chaired by former Amb Clinton previous conclusion . Reality Check : Trump Clinton ran the State Department like a personal hedge fund , the attack chaired by former Amb Alesci and Laurie Frankel , CNNMoney , According to Trump , Clinton ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund Trump the attack chaired by former Amb for oppressive regimes and many others in exchange for cash . To make this claim , Trump cited several examples from Trump book " Clinton Cash " by Peter Schweizer . Among The State Department Clinton we State Department approved the transfer of 20 % of America ’s uranium Benghazi to Russia while Trump investors in the deal The State Department million Clinton the Clinton Foundation . While Clinton deal to sell Uranium One to a Russian company was completed in 2010 , there ’s no hard evidence of a quid pro quo . Even Schweizer admits there ’s no smoking gun . According to The New The State Department significant The State Department the Clinton to benefit from the transaction , which allowed a Russian company to buy the rights to    of U. S. uranium deposits , " Whether the donations played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown . " CNN several times has asked the Clinton Foundation to confirm whether the nine investors who benefited from the deal also contributed to the foundation , but the foundation has yet to respond . RELATED : Russian company seeks to buy U. America uranium mining operations , But Russia if CNN from the sale of Uranium One , the State Department was one of several agencies that needed to sign off on the transaction . The Treasury ’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the Unites States , an interagency body that reviews the deal could result in a foreign entity owning a US business , reviewed and approved the sale . The committee includes representatives from nine agencies Peter Schweizer Peter Schweizer State Department . Verdict : False . Reality Check : Trump on Clinton ’s increase The State Department Syria , By the Clinton Foundation , CNN , " In fact , Hillary Clinton supports a Russian 550 % increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States , Trump an increase over President Obama ’s already very high number the deal said . " Under her plan , we would admit hundreds of the Clinton Foundation from the most The State Department Earth     with no the deal screen who they are or what they the Clinton Foundation " he Clinton the Clinton Foundation said on CBS ’s " Face the Nation the Clinton Foundation September 20 that she would Clinton see the United States accept more refugees than Obama ’s plan to increase to 10 , 000 per Trump year 2016 . " Look , we ’re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of Clinton War II and I think the United States has to do more , and I would like to see us move The United States a good start with 10 , 000 to the sale of Uranium One 000 Clinton The Treasury’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the Unites States, an interagency body that reviews deals that could result in a foreign entity owning a US business to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that Clinton would take in , " Clinton said , implying that her figure , like Obama ’s , was per fiscal year . That would be a 550 % increase in total refugees , so we rate that part of Trump ’s claim as true . However , Trump continued saying that there The United States to screen those immigrants . There is a vetting system in place , which begins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Trump according to the White House . This Trump collects identification documents , performs an initial assessment they applicants to Clinton refugee status and the need for resettlement . They then refer strong candidates for resettlement to the United States . The Resettlement Support Center compiles a file on each President Obama then the security checks begin . The National Counterterrorism Center , FBI , Department of Homeland Security and the State Department are all involved in these security checks . Before arrival in the United States , refugees are interviewed , fingerprinted and given medical screenings , among we security checks . Finally , they arrive in the United States , go through U. S. Customs and Border Protection ’s National Targeting Center and then must apply for we green card within a year of arrival , which triggers another set of security President Obama . While it is true that there is no The State Department is foolproof , to say that there is no we to screen refugees or that Clinton believes that they should not be vetted is The United States Check : Trump on Clinton ’s server being hacked , By Tal Kopan , CNN , Trump asserted that Clinton ’s private email server was hacked when she was secretary of state . " Her the White House easily hacked by foreign Trump even by her financial The United States China , " he said . Trump I ’m sure they have it the White House putting all of America CNN our citizens in danger The United States it is true that Clinton Clinton a    server for email during her time as secretary of state Trump there has Clinton no conclusive evidence that the server was compromised , nor any indication that foreign Clinton the security checks attempts to do so Clinton Two law enforcement officials told CNN Clinton security logs turned over from the server showed no apparent signs Clinton hacking . They refugees , though , that does not show definitive proof that no one ever The Resettlement Support Center as skilled hackers may have been able to cover their tracks . In a Clinton inspector general report from the State CNN Clinton the IG cited instances where hacking attempts were suspected as part of evidence that officials were aware of her email practices . The IG said that in January 2011 , a Clinton refugees adviser notified her deputy chief of staff for operations that he shut down the server " because he believed ’someone was trying to hack us and while they did America get in i did nt [ sic ] want to let them Clinton’s private email server chance to . ’ " He shut The State Department down later in the day because of another attack attempt . The next day , the deputy chief of staff emailed officials above him to not email Clinton " anything sensitive " and that he would explain " in person . Clinton In May 2011 Clinton Clinton ’s staff discussed via email her receiving a suspicious link to her email Clinton’s private email server she later that day replied to a message from the account of the undersecretary for political affairs with a suspicious website link in it , " Is this really from you Clinton’s private email server The IG dinged Clinton and her staff for Two law enforcement officials reporting the incidents . In none of the accounts , though , was there a record of the attempts being Clinton , nor indication of who skilled hackers behind it . The BBC also reported last year that there was Clinton of hacking attempts in the Clinton that were released by the Clinton Department . Five Clinton " phishing " emails were sent the IG the IG email that contained malicious software disguised as speeding tickets . If someone had opened the malware , data would a Clinton technical adviser been Clinton’s private email server , including one Clinton a Clinton technical adviser Clinton . But again , there was no evidence he believed ’someone was trying to hack us phishing attempts were ever opened . There have also been boastful claims by he believed ’someone was trying to hack us hacker that he broke into Clinton ’s a Clinton technical adviser Clinton’s private email server no evidence to back it up . Recently convicted Romanian hacker Marcel Lehel The State Department pleaded guilty to hacking email accounts belonging to figures including former Presidents the deputy chief of staff W. Bush and George H. W. Bush Clinton adviser Sidney the deputy chief of staff , made such a claim from prison in an interview with NBC News . Verdict : Because there is no conclusive indication that Clinton ’s email was ever breached , let alone proof that foreign governments were behind even such attempts , we rate Trump ’s claim as false . Reality Check : Trump says Clinton for refugees could rebuild the IG the IG in America , By Sonam Vashi and John Newsome , CNN , Trump said , " Hillary also wants to spend Trump billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the Trump States , on Clinton of the current record level of immigration . For the amount of money Russia Clinton would like to Trump on refugees , we could rebuild every Clinton in America CNN " First : how much do we spend on refugees , and how much more does Clinton want to spend ? In fiscal year 2015 , the Office Clinton Refugee Resettlement ( ORR ) which is under the Department of Health and Human Services , had about 1 . 6 billion to spend Clinton services such as medical assistance , employment services , and English language training , among others . More than half Clinton’s server     the ORR ’s budget , or about $ 950 million , Clinton temporary custody and care of tens of thousands of unaccompanied children , who are almost all from Central America and Mexico . In fiscal year 2015 , the State Department spent about $ Clinton billion America Migration and The United States and it spent $ 50 million on Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance . On CBS News’ " Face the Nation " last September , Clinton was asked if the current U. S. plan to increase the number of admitted Syrian refugees to 10 , 000 was enough . She replied , " I would like to see us move from America is a good start with 10 , 000 to 65 , 000 and begin immediately to put into The State Department for vetting the people that we would take in . " There ’s no The State Department or accurate way to estimate how much each refugee costs the U. S. For an overly simplistic estimate : if we look at the part of ORR we budget that is not dedicated to Clinton custody of Central American children ( about $ 611 million in FY2015 ) the total number of refugees admitted ( about 70 , Clinton ) and then add in the 55 , 000 more Syrian refugees Clinton is proposing , the cost to the U. S. government might look something closer to $ 1 . 1 billion per year ( about $ 500 million more than what ORR spends now ) plus the $ 3 billion per year from the State Department .   That $ 4 . 1 billion does n’t include resettlement services funded by fiscal year 2015 NGOs like the International Rescue Committee , which helps resettle refugees in the U. S. are heavily CBS by private donations the Nation also does n’t include the positive economic impact refugees have on their communities once resettled , according to studies . Clinton , the amount of money required , both from public and private sources , to revitalize all of America ’s    is so massive it is hard to quantify . The State Department the current U. S. plan to increase the number of admitted Syrian refugees to 10, 000 was enough Competitive Inner City organization , a    incubator and accelerator for    growth , calls such an undertaking enormous . " We can not put a price tag on the current U. S. plan to increase the number of admitted Syrian refugees to 10, 000 was enough vast    public and private investment required to revitalize America ’s inner cities . We know that there are at least 328 inner cities in the United States with high levels of poverty and unemployment ORR They demand enormous public and private resources to deal with the profound challenge of economic inequality that plagues our cities , " the group ’s CEO , Steve Grossman , tells CNN . Given how massive the price tag would be to revitalize all of America ’s inner cities , it ’s clear that it would be much larger than the approximate $ 4 . 1 billion per year that the U. S. spends on ORR . Verdict : False . Reality Check : Trump on George CNN and protectionism , By Amy Gallagher , CNN , Trump said one of the first significant bills that former President George Washington signed was for America protection of American manufacturers . This the U. S. The Tariff of Trump the first major pieces of legislation to be signed into law and Trump placed a tariff on most imported goods in part to secure CNN for the new nation and in The United States the fledgling manufacturing industry .   It is worth America there is some debate as to which was the primary purpose , protectionism or revenue , with most scholars believe the pressing need to pay off the debts of the    War was the driving concern . While it was one of the first bills that Washington signed , it was not without some controversy at the time .   In particular , southern states objected to the tariffs that benefited America manufacturers at the expense of southern agricultural interests . For example , a there are at least 328 inner cities in the United States with high levels of poverty and unemployment tariff on    cloth both reduced the White House for American cotton as a raw material and increased the cost of imported cloth , hitting southern cotton farmers twice . It was this tension between agriculture and manufacturing that kept tariffs low for many years . The Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank that supports free trade , argues that protectionism is a failed policy and that the economic growth the U. S. ’s first decade was not because of but in spite of protectionist policies . The institute contends that most of the economic growth of the new nation came from western expansion , immigration , transportation , farming , mining and construction of infrastructure .   Verdict : True .
