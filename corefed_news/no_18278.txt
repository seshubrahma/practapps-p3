’   ’ ’    The president of North America’ ’s largest bicycle manufacturer has    slammed President Donald Trump over The president of North America’’s largest bicycle manufacturer   failed leadership , and misguided    " America First theory . " ’ ’    John Burke , the head of Waterloo ,     lambasted Trump    during an interview with Business Insider on Thursday , saying Trump       missed a huge opportunity to simplify a complicated tax system    and has failed to lead the country . ’ ’    " We’’re 100 days in and We’’re 100 days in finally comes out with a tax plan   —    and    it was 250 words ? And there was no bad news , " We’’re 100 days in said . " Here’ ’s    this huge opportunity to simplify everything and to have massive    change , and you get 250 words . " ’ ’    While Trump’ ’s tax plan contains broad outlines rather than firm    legislative text , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National    Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said Trump’’s tax plan would include    " the biggest tax cut " in US history , echoing statements made by    Trump . ’ "    Trek , a    company , was cofounded by Richard Burke ,    John ’s father , in a Waterloo barn in 1976 . Today it is a global    bike business worth over $ 1 billion , and it it 2 , 000 people    worldwide . It it a variety of bikes , including kids’ bikes ,    mountain bikes , and    road bikes . It it owns the     team that competes    in the . " ’    Burke , who says he is neither a Republican nor a Democrat but an    independent , is the author of " , " published in 2016 , which " challenges Americans    to resist the status quo and change what elected officials are    unwilling or unable to change . " ’ ’   ’ ’    " Look , I don’’t need a tax break   —    Trek doesn’’t need a tax break , "    Burke told Business Insider . " We’’re going to succeed and fail in       market based on how good our products are and how good our our    are . As a member of the community , we have a moral duty    to be a good corporate citizen , and one way you’’re a good    corporate citizen is you pay your taxes . " ’ ’    Burke added that , from a competitive standpoint , American    corporate taxes should come down   —    but so should all the    deductions . And while he Burke praise Trump for reducing the number    of tax brackets , he Burke him Burke not getting rid of    corporate deductions altogether . ’ ’    " You have General Electric , a great American company , which made    a profit of $ 12 billion . They General Electric, a great American company, which made   a profit of $12 billion a    tax return and    paid zero in taxes . ’ ’    " So if you want to reduce corporate taxes , that’ ’s fine , reduce    them you want to reduce corporate taxes " Burke went on , " but Trump wants to reduce them you want to reduce corporate taxes 35 % to       % and I think that’ ’s too big a decline . But then he Burke    want to get rid of any of the deductions ? ’ ’    " Why do oil companies get deductions and bicycle companies don’’t ?    Why do certain industries get deductions and shoemakers don’’t ?    The brewer doesn’’t get a deduction . It The brewer make sense . You’’re    leaving in place this    tax system . ’ ’    " So it’ ’s treats for everybody . For corporate America , you get a    lower rate , and you get to keep your deductions . And for all the    individual taxpayers , you get a lower rate . ’ ’    " We’’re 19 trillion frickin dollars in debt and everybody got a    treat . And I just go , ’’ You’’re kidding me . ’’ You call that       ? I don’’t . " ’ ’    Burke also criticized Trump on his Burke of the the United States ’ ’    " When you’’re the president of the United States and you come out    with this ’’ American First ’’ theory , what are you saying to the    rest of the world ? ’ ’    " I’’ve been so fortunate here in growing the business . When I    started    , we were doing $ 16 million and now we do we a    billion dollars , and I’’ve worked I’’ve an incredible team to do    that . We took we business the business being in the US to right now     —    60 % of our business is we the world . ’ ’   ’ ’    " And one of the reasons why American is as strong as it is , is    there are a lot of great American companies who have access to    markets all around the world   —    General Electric ,      Apple , Trek ,   . ’ ’    " The whole ’’ American First ’’ thing . .. I just don’’t find that    conducive to America’ ’s future or anyone else in the world . " ’ ’    " The best definition I ever heard of leadership is , leadership is    the ability to make the dream a reality at the grassroots level , "    Burke added . " But leadership is also , " Here’ ’s the vision , and I’’m    going to convince people where we need to go . " And what we’’ve    come to in American politics is saying , ’’ Well , I need to get    elected , so I’’m going to I’’m    all these people whatever they want    all these people hear    ’’ ’ ’    " You know , if you’’re the richest person on the playground and    you’’re the biggest person on the playground . the playground know , we    usually lead like , ’’ Talk softly and carry a big stick , ’’ and when    we’’re walking    with a blow horn , that’ ’s not the way we    roll . we ’    " We’’re a leader in the world , but to maintain that status over    the long haul , you actually need a leader who can look at the    people and say , ’’ You know , we’’ve got problems here ’’   —    and whether    your talking about tax codes , gun control , nuclear proliferation ,    big issues         ’’ Here are the problems , and here are the solutions ,    and this is    we need to do it . ’’ ’ ’    " And more than just a sound bite , we’’ve got to educate people and    say , ’’    is why we need to move we . ’’ And I think we lack that    we now ,    I think we’’ve lacked it for a while    " ’ ’   ’ ’     ’ "    Trump ’s proposal did not include a large number of key details ,    including the income levels associated with a new      tax system , the tax rate for a    repatriation of corporate    profits held overseas , and others .
