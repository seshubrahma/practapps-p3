On Wednesday ’s broadcast of MSNBC ’s " Rachel Maddow Show , " Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook stated , " it ’s only fitting for a bully like Trump to hire a bully to run Trump campaign . "   Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook said that " [ W]e hear rehashed conspiracy theories , we do n’t hear very much at all about what Trump ’s going to do to actually make people ’s lives better , " from Trump . " And Trump doubled down on this today by appointing someone to lead Trump campaign who makes these conspiracy theories basically Trump professional mission . So , yes , we are going to hear more of this . this ’s very disturbing , but I think this ’s only fitting for a bully like Trump to hire a bully to run Trump campaign . " Trump added , " I think his campaign ’s going to be more unpredictable . I think we ’re going to see more conspiracy theories out there . I do n’t think we we going to see Trump become more serious , become more presidential .    …      I think what we we seeing in this is Trump doubling down on Trump smallest , most divisive , most hateful inclinations , and , so , I think it this going to be more of the same . It this probably going to be worse of the same . " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
