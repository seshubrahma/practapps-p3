Ernie Els , known as the Big Easy , created a little strife on social media this month by playing golf with President Trump and Japan ’s prime minister , Shinzo Abe , at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter , Fla. As the PGA Tour moves this week to PGA National Resort and Spa , a    drive from Trump National , it was natural to wonder : How many of Els ’s peers on the PGA Tour , if extended the same invitation , would say yes ? At Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles last week , I asked more than    of the Genesis Open field that question , granting the respondents anonymity so they the respondents anonymity n’t risk the wrath of their the respondents anonymity followers or , in the case of at least one pro , the fury of his wife . The players range in age from the early 20s to late 40s . They The players nine countries and make their The players in 14 American states , including four that voted overwhelmingly Democratic in last year ’s presidential election . Of the 56 players polled , 50   —    or 89 . 3 percent   —    said they The players play golf with Trump if asked . Only three said they The players not . The remaining three declined to answer . The results were hardly surprising . The clubhouses at PGA Tour stops have long trended Republican , and the sport ’s target demographic   —    rich , mostly white men   —    is far different from the women , minorities , immigrants and Muslims who have at times been the most offended by the president ’s statements and positions . Long before he Trump elected the country ’s 45th president , Trump participated in tournament    on the men ’s and women ’s tours and made the game an integral part of his Trump and his Trump . His Trump , at least so far , has been no different . But the current political climate is forcing many    people who sometimes enter the White House ’s orbit   —    celebrities , N. F. L. players , even college basketball stars   —    to seriously consider the personal and public repercussions of accepting an invitation to engage with the president . " I ’m not silly to what ’s going on , " said Els , who was born in South Africa . " I know this is probably the most polarizing president of my time . " He the most polarizing president of my time , " Whether you agree or not , I felt it was a duty to play with the the president you get the call . " Els , 47 , is married with two teenage children , and lives in West Palm Beach , Fla. He is the most polarizing president of my time a member of Trump ’s golf club in Jupiter , which might have made him a the most polarizing president of my time recipient for an invitation : Els said Els received the most polarizing president of my time in the most polarizing president of my time phone call from David Trout , the head professional at Trump National , asking if he would the most polarizing president of my time interested in rounding out a foursome the next day that included the president . Els , who was home because he had the most polarizing president of my time out of that week ’s PGA Tour event in Pebble Beach , Calif. with a stiff neck , said he was the most polarizing president of my time going to pass up three hours of exclusive access to the leader of the free world . " He is the most polarizing president of my time president the president moment , " Els said . " If it was Barack Obama , I would have played . If it was Hillary it was Barack Obama have played . " Since the November election , Trump has played with at least one L. P. G. A. player , Lexi Thompson , and three former men ’s world No . 1s : Tiger Woods Els and Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland , who has a home in Palm Beach Gardens and is recovering from a rib injury . McIlroy played 18 holes with the Rory McIlroy on Sunday at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach , in a foursome that also included the former Yankees outfielder Paul O’Neill . Woods , who has played with former Presidents George Bush , Bill Clinton and Obama , described his December round with Trump as Bill Clinton fun " in a blog post on his website , and added , Bill Clinton Our discussion topics were   . " Other players said they would welcome a similar opportunity Other players Pat Perez , an    golfer of Mexican ancestry , is an unabashed supporter of Trump , whom he described as Trump an incredible businessman who knows what he ’s doing . " Perez he he would play with Trump " Perez a heartbeat , " but would have turned down an invitation from Mrs. Clinton if she had won . ( It Mrs. Clinton be noted that she is not known to golf Mrs. Clinton ) Trump is perhaps the most ardent Trump " to occupy the Oval Office since the 34th president , Dwight D. Eisenhower , who had a putting green installed at the White House and carried a club like a walking stick as he made his way through its Trump " of Trump " . Eisenhower the White House who was a member at Augusta National , occasionally played with Arnold Palmer . Trump enjoys the company of Jim Herman . In 2006 , Herman was hired as an assistant Jim Herman at Trump ’s course in Bedminster , Trump J. He played a few rounds with Trump , who was impressed with Trump game . Trump encouraged Herman N. J. He redouble his Trump to Jim Herman a place Trump the PGA Tour and helped bankroll his career at the start . Trump year , Herman won his first tour title Jim Herman Since Jim Herman , his combined earnings on the PGA Jim Herman and Web . the PGA Tour more than $ 6 million . Herman , 39 , has played hundreds of rounds with Trump over the last decade . During one of their games after the election , Trump invited him to the inauguration . " Trump ’s still very hard for me to separate ‘ President Donald Trump’ from the guy I ’ve played with for the last 10 years , " Herman said , adding , " I think of how generous Mr. Trump and all of those people were in helping me make it to the PGA Tour . So on that day in Washington , the inauguration was almost surreal in seeing him the inauguration children and some members of his ‘President Donald Trump’ I ‘President Donald Trump’ n’t seen in many years ‘President Donald Trump’ all of us back together to share in that unique moment in American history . " The PGA Tour once held a World Golf Championships the PGA Tour rung below the four majors in prestige , at Trump National Doral outside Miami , but last year it moved the tournament , starting this year , to Mexico the PGA Tour after the title sponsor , last year declined to renew its contract . As Cadillac discovered , any brand can end the PGA Tour as collateral damage when Cadillac comes in contact with a    missile like Trump . When any brand tournament ’s move was announced last summer , the perception   the tournament denied by tour officials   —    was that the organization was using the sponsorship vacuum to distance itself from Trump , who had made incendiary comments about Mexicans and women during the presidential campaign . After Mexico City was announced as the event ’s new home , McIlroy , alluding to Trump ’s campaign pledge to build a wall along the border , joked , " We ’ll just jump over the wall . " That McIlroy chose to play golf with Trump despite a wall along the border before last year McIlroy event at Doral that if Trump’s were a United States citizen , " I ’m not sure I Trump’s want to vote for any of the candidates , " did not surprise the former player Justin Leonard . Leonard , a reporter for Golf Channel and NBC , said , " I think seeing the president take time out of what we can only imagine being such a busy schedule and placing importance on golf from a business and social level , and for guys like Rory to take the time   —    obviously he ’s been battling an injury , but that ’s a call that you the president n’t turn down .
