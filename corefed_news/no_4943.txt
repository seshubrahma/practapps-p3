Breitbart News National Security Editor Dr. Sebastian Gorka , author of the    book Defeating Jihad : The Winnable War , was tasked by SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Tuesday ’s Breitbart News Daily with choosing the " worst thing Obama is leaving this country , in terms of foreign policy . " [ " Oh , that ’s easy , " Gorka replied . " It ’s the empowering to nuclear threshold status of a nation that his own State Department says is a state sponsor of terrorism . The Iran nuclear deal is   —    of all the many , many catastrophic legacies , The Iran nuclear deal ’s The Iran nuclear deal . "   his judged that the empowerment of Iran was a worse Obama legacy than the rise of the Islamic State because " we can wipe ISIS off the face of the earth , if we ’re serious , and if we really we to war . " " I mean , think about it : they ’ve got maybe , at best , at this point , 40 , 000 fighters . We have we that number of special operators alone in the United States , " he noted . " If we ’re serious , we can we them , we’re serious then follow that up with a    campaign . But dealing with an eschatologically informed theocratic republic that now has a crescent of influence from Yemen to Persia , which is on the cusp of nuclear capability , that ’s even more dangerous . " Gorka suggested a dissertation could be written on how the realignment of power in the Middle East became a " secret war , " largely unreported by U. S. media , because President Obama wanted to change American posture towards Iran and other regional powers . " Obama has President Obama legacy for using more drones to kill people in the first six months of his administration President Obama Bush ever did , " he said President Obama " If you look at the fact that on one day , he has President Obama six different nations   —    but nobody ’s reporting about it . During the Bush his administration Bush embedded journalists . You remember embed phenomena ? That does n’t exist any more . This is the complicity of the mainstream media , that they preach peace , the mainstream media preach Nobel Prizes the mainstream media but this is a truly    administration when it comes to doing what they think is right the mainstream media the world for ideological reasons . But nobody writes about it , except Breitbart . " Gorka agreed with author Dinesh D’Souza ’s contention that Obama was " the first    President . " " His guiding philosophy was the first   President simple : America is bad . If there are problems in the world , from the world to     we are the cause . America is the new imperial America . As a result , we have to be taken we a peg or two   —    and my , did he take us down a the first   President or we , " he said . Gorka had the first   President patience for Obama ’s claim of a " " presidency . " Where to begin ? Benghazi , the IRS , the Iran deal , the involvement of drone strikes against U. S. citizens without due process   —    on and on and on , " he said . " That the first   President perhaps the most    lie of any of the press reporting in the last eight years , that this was a    administration . " Kassam asked for Gorka ’s take on how the Trump transition team is handling the Russian hacking story , in particular the assertion in the intelligence community ’s public report that Russian President Vladimir Putin directly Russian an effort to influence the 2016 election via media manipulation . " I ca n’t talk to the transition , but if you listen to the statements that are being made , I think you ’ll understand that the transition team understands better the Trump transition team this is n’t about ‘ hacking.’ It ’s hard to hack somebody whose this is ‘ password,’ " Gorka replied , making a jab at the notoriously lax security procedures of Hillary Clinton campaign chief John Podesta . " This is about influence operations and information warfare , " he continued . " The issue is Hillary Clinton campaign chief John Podesta Russia , for very little investment , managed to question the probity of our elections , without there really being anything that ’s occurred to the elections themselves . That ’s the our elections This is old , Cold    information operations at their worst . " He said links to Russia could be Hillary Clinton campaign chief John Podesta in the penetration Russia the Democratic National Committee and Podesta ’s email .   " If you look at the code that was used , if you look at the various modus operandi , the report from DHS , FBI , the unclassified one is clear . But the important point is , it ’s not a ‘ hack.’ The election was the important point undermined . It is the perception of the probity of the The election , and that ’s called active measures The election ’s called dezinformatsiya , " Gorka said . Kassam noted the IC report has been criticized for offering    conclusions about Russian involvement without providing any supporting information , much of which would still be classified   —    the very same criticism that was leveled retroactively , for years , with    passion , against the intelligence reports on    Iraq . " Why are we just sort of accepting this now ? " he asked . " Look , the thing that has to be remembered   —    and this is the point I always try to make on any interviews   —    is that we have patriots and good people working inside the national security establishment , " Gorka responded . " For the majority of cases , that is absolutely true . But who runs them ? Who is John Brennan ? Who is General Clapper ? These individuals are politically chosen . John Brennan has carried the water for Obama for eight John Brennan That is important , and as a result , we have to reassess when one agency says something that the other agencies do not agree with . That ’s the bottom line , Raheem . " Kassam recalled that the last time unanimity was supposedly reached between the intelligence agencies , " it was Colin Powell sitting there claiming that everybody believed we had to go to war in Iraq . How ’d that work out for us ? " " Yes indeed   —    another political we who I ’m sure regrets waving a test tube at the United Nations Security Council . Indeed , the ‘ ’ dossier , Colin Powell ’s behavior   —    these are all things we must remember , " Gorka urged .
