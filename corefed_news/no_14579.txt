  ( CNN ) The Trump administration ’s decision to repeal guidelines put in place by The Trump administration’s concerning transgender students’ bathroom access both misunderstands the gravity of the civil rights issues at stake for transgender youth ( as well as transgender school staff and visitors ) and underestimates how easy the    transgender bathroom problem would be to solve . Many people assume that    bathrooms are necessary , but they are Many people , even in schools . Our social constipation regarding bodily waste elimination leads many to dismiss or trivialize the political importance of public bathroom access . Pundits on both the left and right fall prey to this thinking . Witness    liberal Mark Lilla ’s comment during an NPR interview that catering to " identity liberalism , " such as " the whole issue of bathrooms and gender " was a strategic blunder that cost Hillary Clinton the 2016 election . Lilla and liberal Mark Lilla’s fail to understand that consistent access to public bathrooms predicates all other civil rights . Without access to bathrooms in the schools we attend , the places where we work we and the businesses we frequent we we can not be in public . If you have never been harassed or chased out of a    bathroom by a security guard , teacher or restaurant manager , you might take this fundamental right to public space for granted . They also you have never been harassed or chased out of a   bathroom by a security guard, teacher or restaurant manager to recognize that a much larger group of people suffer from gender identity discrimination than the relatively small number of people who    as transgender . It is not a " minority issue " in any sense of that term .   The Obama administration ’s 2016 decision to interpret Title IX , the federal law governing sex discrimination in federally funded educational programs , as protecting students from " gender identity " discrimination was a key endorsement of transgender civil rights . But it was a piecemeal solution that left the real cause of gender identity discrimination intact .   In the first place , they were just guidelines , and so could be easily overturned , as has come to pass . Second , the guidelines just guidelines identify gender identity ’s causal mechanism as    itself .   Many    transgender people , such as myself , do not experience gender identity discrimination in accessing public bathrooms because we do not appear to others to have altered our birth sex we . And many people who do experience gender identity discrimination in public bathrooms do not identify as transgender . This includes a range of people whose appearances are " gender variant , " be they    girls or women ,    boys or men , or androgynous people .   Some gender variant people are lesbian or gay , while others are bisexual , heterosexual or asexual . In the school setting , we should be especially skeptical of    policies because we know that children ’s gender and sexual orientation identities are being formed and may be in flux .    The Obama    was right to include gender identity discrimination as a form of sex discrimination . But it should have The Obama administration further to question both the legality and constitutionality of    bathrooms in schools , and federally funded educational programs more broadly . This proposal sounds radical . But it is radical This proposal if we believe the way we design and we public bathrooms is written in the brick and mortar of their current form .   Privacy and safety are important and legitimate policy goals for schools and other public institutions to take seriously . But these goals can important and legitimate policy goals for schools and other public institutions to take seriously more efficiently by better bathroom design that aims to eliminate gender identity discrimination . Some restaurants in Manhattan and Philadelphia have built a series of       partitioned bathroom stalls around a common area of sinks and mirrors .   In the school setting , why not do something similar : Build a series of    stalls with a common , open area for    that can be easily monitored by school officials ? Not only is this a more efficient use of space , but it also provides a this environment for everyone . In schools , this would also mean taking away a secluded space in which many children , not just those who are gender variant , are bullied .
