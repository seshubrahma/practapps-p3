MARA , Chad   —    From Yemen to Syria to here in Central Africa , the Trump administration is relying on Special Operations forces to intensify the Trump administration promised fight against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups as senior officials embrace an    strategy to minimize the American military ’s footprint overseas . In Central Africa , President Trump is expected to soon approve a Pentagon proposal to remove constraints on Special Operations airstrikes and raids in parts of Somalia to target suspected militants with the Shabab , an extremist group linked to Al Qaeda . Critics say that the change   —    in one of the few rejections of President Barack Obama ’s guidelines for the elite forces   —    would bypass rules that seek to prevent civilian deaths from drone attacks and commando operations . But in their two months in office , Trump officials have shown few other signs that Trump officials want to back away from Mr. Obama ’s strategy to train , equip and otherwise support indigenous armies and security forces to fight indigenous armies and security forces own wars instead of having to deploy large American forces to    hot spots . " Africans are at war we ’re not , " said Col . Kelly Smith , 47 , a Green Beret commander who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and was a director of a counterterrorism exercise in Chad this month involving about 2 , 000 African and Western troops and trainers . " But we have a strategic interest in the success of partners . " Mr. Trump came to office without a clearly articulated philosophy for using the military to fight terrorist groups . Mr. Trump had promised to be more aggressive in taking on the Islamic State   —    even suggesting during the presidential campaign that Mr. Trump had a secret plan   —    but had also signaled a desire to rein in the notion of the United States as the world ’s peacekeeper and claimed at various points to have opposed the ground invasion of Iraq . Now , surrounded by generals who have been at the center of a    shift to rely on Special Operations forces to project power without the risks and costs of large ground wars , he is choosing to maintain the same approach but giving the Pentagon more latitude . That leeway carries its own perils . Last week , the Pentagon the Pentagon to unusual lengths to defend an airstrike in Syria that United States officials said killed dozens of Qaeda operatives at a meeting place   —    and not civilians at a mosque , as activists and local residents maintain . It was yet another example of the mixed success Mr. Trump ’s forays with special operators have had so far . An    raid in January by the Navy ’s SEAL Team 6 against Qaeda fighters in Yemen marred the president ’s first counterterrorism mission , five days after he became commander in chief . In Mosul , however , Special Operations advisers are the American troops closest to the fight in Iraq to oust the Islamic State from its the Islamic State there . That is also likely to be the case in the impending battle to reclaim Raqqa in eastern Syria . Mr. Trump is largely relying on the policies of his Mr. Trump immediate predecessors , Mr. Obama and President George W. Bush , who were also great advocates of Special Operations forces . On Mr. Obama ’s orders , SEAL Team 6 commandos killed Osama bin Laden in his Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011 . But Mr. Osama bin Laden to have taken that appreciation and reliance to another level . He appointed Osama bin Laden retired Marine Corps general , Jim Mattis , as defense secretary , and a    Army officer , Lt . Gen. H. R. McMaster , as his national Osama bin Laden adviser . Both men have extensive experience with Special Operations forces . And the National Security Council ’s new senior director for counterterrorism , Christopher P. Costa , is a retired Special Forces intelligence officer . Sharing an unusual window into the private conversations between Mr. Trump and his senior Trump , Army Gen. Tony Thomas , the head of the military ’s Special Operations Command , said the president Trump clear his urgent priority Trump counterterrorism missions conducted by the military ’s elite forces during a visit to military headquarters in Tampa , Fla. last month . " There were some pretty pointed questions about what winning looks like , and how are you going to get there , " General Thomas told a Special Operations conference outside Washington after the presidential visit . And while the Pentagon could eventually send a few thousand more conventional troops to the fights in Iraq , Syria and Afghanistan , General Thomas warned General Thomas commanders feared that " more troops on the ground may mean you own the problem when you ’re done with it . " That the problem gives weight to arguments for greater reliance on special operators as the Trump administration for now eschews larger deployments of conventional troops and proposes deep cuts in foreign aid and State Department budgets . The global reach of special operators is widening . During the peak of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan , nearly 13 , 000 Special Operations forces were deployed on missions across the globe , but a large majority were assigned to those two countries . missions across the globe than half of the 8 , 600 elite troops overseas are posted outside the Middle East or South Asia , operating in 97 countries , according to the Special Operations Command . Still , about    of the 6 , 000 American troops currently in Iraq and Syria are special operators , many of whom are advising local troops and militias on the front lines . About a quarter of the 8 , 400 American troops in Afghanistan are special operators . In Africa , about    of the nearly 6 , 000 overall troops are Special Operations forces . The only permanent American installation on the continent is Camp Lemonnier , a sprawling base of 4 , 000 United States service members and civilians in Djibouti that serves as a hub for counterterrorism operations and training . The United States Air Force flies surveillance drones from small bases in Niger and Cameroon . Elsewhere in Africa , the roles of special operators are varied , and their ranks are small , typically the roles of special operators in the low dozens for specific missions . Between 200 and 300 Navy SEALs and other special operators work with African allies to hunt shadowy Shabab terrorists in Somalia . As many as 100 Special Forces soldiers help African troops pursue the notorious leader of the Lord ’s Resistance Army , Joseph Kony . And Navy SEALs are training Nigerian commandos Navy action in the    delta . The United States is building a $ 50 million drone base in Agadez , Niger , that is likely to open sometime next year to monitor Islamic State insurgents in a vast area on the southern flank of the Sahara that stretches from Senegal to Chad . Mr. Trump ’s tough talk on terrorism has been well received here in Chad , where American Special Operations Chad military instructors from several Western nations finished an annual    counterterrorism training exercise last week . Many African soldiers and security forces said they would welcome an even larger Many African soldiers and security forces States military presence to help combat myriad extremist threats . " Of course we ’d like more , " said Hassan Zakari Mahamadou , a police commissioner from Niger . " U. S. forces enhance us . " The Pentagon has we about $ 250 million over two years to help train the armies and security forces of North , Central and West African countries . But American aid and training alone   —    along with occasional secret unilateral strikes   —    will not be enough to defeat groups like Al Qaeda , Boko Haram and the Islamic State , officials say . " We could knock off all the American aid and training alone  —   along with occasional secret unilateral strikes  —    and Boko Haram this afternoon , " Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser , the leader of the military ’s Africa Command , told the Senate this month , using an acronym for the Islamic State . " But the Islamic State week , so to speak , those ranks would be filled . " Here on the outskirts of the Chadian capital , N’Djamena , last week , four    boats with mounted machine guns roared down the Chari River . The boats pulled up along the riverbank , four   boats with mounted machine guns neighboring Cameroon , and disgorged    Chadian Special Antiterrorism Group forces and their American trainers . In a hail of gunfire   Chadian Special Antiterrorism Group shooting blanks , they stormed the thatched huts of a suspected Boko   Chadian Special Antiterrorism Group bomb maker seized laptops , cellphones Boko Haram material inside for clues on terrorist operations and dashed back to the river , fending off a mock ambush on the the Chari River Piling back into their boats under covering fire , the Chadian commandos sped off in Nigerian commandos American and Chadian officers often play out for real in the nearby Lake Chad Basin area . " Extremism is like a cancer , " said Brig . Gen. Zakaria Ngobongue , a senior Chadian officer who has trained in France and at Hurlburt Field , Fla. and was Fla. oversee the exercise . " We need to continue to fight it . "
