  ( CNN ) In case you did n’t hear any fanfare late Friday night when Hillary Clinton announced Hillary Clinton vice presidential running mate , that ’s because Tim Kaine is not a fanfare type of candidate .   Tim Kaine is , by definition , meh .   Then again , running against the irrational and unpredictable Donald Trump and Donald Trump out of touch right wing running mate Mike Pence , maybe a steady dose of " meh " is what this election needs .    Tim Kaine is basically unobjectionable , which is really just an extension of Hillary Clinton ’s most plausible case to    Republican voters   —    " You should vote for me Tim Kaine that Trump Donald Trump is nuts . "   That ’s not to say there are n’t plenty of   reasons to affirmatively vote for Hillary Hillary Clinton —    here ’s a good list of 112 of them .   But the fact is that a lot of the country seems    on hating her no matter how experienced , knowledgeable and thoughtful she proves her to her .   So for her campaign her a smart tactical move is make sure those voters hate Trump more than they hate those voters .   In this calculus , Tim Kaine makes sense .    He does Tim Kaine make you feel much of anything one way or the other . This is , of course , not true for progressives   —    the      wing of the Democratic Party .   We were truly hoping for a bold choice in Hillary ’s running mate , along the lines of Elizabeth Warren herself or at least Sherrod Brown or Tom Perez .    It would have been refreshing if the Clinton campaign   —    and    extension the Democratic establishment   —    finally recognized that centrist big    economic policies , military hawkishness and social and environmental incrementalism were not only alienating many Democrats but the American people in general .    Donald Trump is a divisive , xenophobic , angry hate mongerer .   But he has Donald Trump tapped into the real economic desperation felt by many Americans .   Bernie Sanders also understood and spoke to that economic desperation in both the rhetoric and policy of his campaign Bernie Sanders    Hillary has tried to make a pivot to appeal to the Sanders voters , but it remains a pivot awkward fit with her centrist Hillary .   A bold , progressive VP choice would have been both an important symbol and translator   —    helping Clinton secure not only the begrudging but also enthusiastic support of the progressive   vote , and also potentially lure many Trump voters drawn to his    strands of populism .    But that ’s not what happened .   Instead , we got Tim Kaine .   The Tim Kaine who supported    authorization for the    Partnership trade deal and said opponents of free trade have " a loser ’s mentality . "   The Tim Kaine Tim Kaine parental notification laws and a ban on    abortions   —    although during his time in the Senate , Kaine has earned a 100 % rating from Planned Parenthood for votes there .   The Tim Kaine who has promoted mythical ,    " clean coal . "   The Tim Kaine who repealed   Virginia ’s estate tax .   The Tim Kaine who supports        " right to work " laws .     As if there was any doubt , Third Way   —    a key centrist Democratic institution   —    immediately sent out a press release praising Clinton ’s choice of Kaine .   It ’s hard to know exactly what a conservative is these days as the Republican Party suffers through its very public the Republican Party painful existential crisis around the concept , but I think we can be fairly clear that whatever the definition of progressive , Tim Kaine is Kaine .    Of course , in the grander scheme of a presidential campaign , the vice presidential nominee may not matter that much anyway . Christopher Devine and Kyle C. Kopko , authors of " The VP Advantage : How Running Mates Influence Home State Voting in Presidential Elections , " analyzed    election returns since 1884 and found no evidence that a vice presidential nominee helps with winning his or her home a vice presidential nominee   —    let alone other states .   Devine and Kopko also Christopher Devine whether a vice presidential nominee could help turn out voters from her or his demographic a vice presidential nominee — a vice presidential nominee for instance , whether a female VP pick helps turn out women or a Jewish VP pick helps turn out Jewish voters .    Devine and Kopko found Devine and Kopko positively in surveys   —    but those positive feelings did n’t actually translate to votes .   " Women , for instance , were no more likely than in other years to vote for a ticket featuring a woman as running mate , and the same generally goes for religious minorities , " Devine and Kopko wrote . So Devine and Kopko for the most critical    position in American politics , what does a vice president do for a presidential campaign ?   More than any other personnel choice , a presidential candidate ’s VP pick signals the kind of leaders with which she or he would surround themselves in the a presidential candidate’s House a presidential candidate’s as well she or he the substantive vision he or she would advance .   As a presidential candidate’s saying a presidential candidate’s , we ’re all judged by the company we keep .   Or , to borrow we euphemism , actions speak louder than words .     Amidst political campaigns generally characterized by rhetorical excess , the choice of a running mate is a decisive , specific and telling act .    It may not matter to the outcome of the election , but it still matters to our perception of the It candidate .    I understand that Hillary Clinton has to    appealing to the progressive base while reaching out to swing voters .   And yet it should be clear by now that the conventional wisdom that these two goals are at odds is not the case in this     election cycle .    Beyond the racial resentment , xenophobia and    that is very plainly coursing through the veins of Trump ’s candidacy and his supporters’ fervor , this election is also Trump’s by a genuine craving for radical change , new ideas and new leadership   —    a craving that cuts across partisan divides .    Hillary Clinton sells herself as a steady    amidst this tumult Hillary Clinton and that ’s right , but she also needs to be riding the waves Hillary Clinton change to some degree as well .   Tim Kaine does n’t help her do that .   He ’s just Hillary Clinton rock on the shore Tim Kaine
