" Ian Bremmer , geopolitical analyst and president of the Eurasia Group , shares Ian Bremmer opinions on President Trump ’s foreign trip . Following is a transcript of the video . " " I think that foreign trip was quite well planned by the Trump Administration . You know that presidents usually go to Canada or Mexico first . It ’s not a long trip , they ’re the most aligned and closest allies , there ’s nowhere else they they go for help particularly , right ? President Trump did n’t do that . And that was right because the Canadians and the Mexicans have serious problems with President Trump on immigration , on climate change , on trade , you name it . And furthermore , there would have been big demonstrations against President Trump if President Trump had done either of those trips as president . Where , President Trump went to Saudi Arabia first . The Saudis really disliked Obama , they The Saudis delighted that President Trump came in on President Trump Iran views , on President Trump human rights lack abuse , on President Trump focus on security . Then , President Trump goes to Israel , President Trump feels very comfortable with Netanyahu personally , the family gets along with them the family President Trump ’s treated quite well , goes to the Vatican after that , does n’t have a good relationship with the people but the pope is not going to embarrass President Trump .
