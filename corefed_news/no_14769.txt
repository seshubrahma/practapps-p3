  ( CNN ) On Wednesday , former Governor Jon Huntsman accepted President Donald Trump ’s offer to serve as US ambassador to Russia . Having previously served as an ambassador to China , former Governor Jon Huntsman may feel prepared for the task at hand . But chances are former Governor Jon Huntsman will become the latest President Donald Trump employee to face professional embarrassment in the days and weeks to come .   Just look at Sean Spicer squirm and wiggle away from questions about President Donald Trump outrageous claims , something the White House spokesman has been required to do many times since Inauguration Day . Once a    professional , Spicer has Sean Spicer Exhibit A in a growing body of evidence that suggests that serious people with reputations they value reputations the President at their own reputations . In his previous the President , as communications director of the Republican National Committee , Spicer was Sean Spicer as a fierce partisan who was , nevertheless , trustworthy . However , before he even the President into his new the President Wing job , the press secretary was forced to defend , despite photographic evidence , Trump ’s claim that his inauguration Trump’s attended by enormous crowds .     Less than one week into his tenure Trump’s Spicer became Sean Spicer butt of endless jokes and his credibility Trump’s so damaged that speculation over his dismissal Trump’s in the news media . In California , former gubernatorial press secretaries offered both pity and advice for the man Trump’s There is no fighting chance now that there could be a trust relationship ( between Spicer and Sean Spicer press ) because it ’s been so abused , " said Kevin Eckery , press secretary to former GOP Governor Pete Wilson .     Since then , Spicer has Sean Spicer many more falsehoods , saying that an order that Trump called a " ban " on Muslim immigrants was not a ban , that no one in the Trump campaign had Trump with Russian officials and , most recently , that a Fox News reporter ’s phone had been tapped while Obama was in office . Because his stock in Obama is credibility , Spicer took a Obama risk when he agreed to Obama chief spokesman for a president with such a loose relationship with facts . ( Of 372 Trump statements checked by the authoritative Politifact . com , just 15 have been rated as fully " true . ") And Spicer is not Obama only one who has experienced humiliation in Trump ’s administration Trump The men appointed to lead various intelligence agencies assumed office knowing that the new President had antagonized the     for months , questioning the    conclusion that Russia had tried to sway the 2016 election in Trump ’s favor . Trump continued to undermine Trump intelligence community even after his inauguration . As Trump plummeted , leaks to the press revealed that intelligence professionals were uneasy with Trump ’s leadership . Trump the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn , who was forced to step down because he lied about his own contacts with Russia he ambassador in Washington .            The Flynn debacle raises serious questions about the president ’s judgement as the President’s . Notoriously    Flynn was reportedly pushed Flynn Flynn same job that he held under Obama because he Flynn abrasive and worked against Flynn President ’s policy .   Flynn won Trump ’s confidence when Flynn became an early supporter in Flynn campaign . At the Republican National Convention , he cried " Damn right " Flynn people chanted " Lock her up ! " In appointing Flynn , Trump signaled that personal loyalty mattered more Trump temperament and judgment . Anyone with any doubts about the challenge of working for Trump need only consider that the President Trump top pick to replace Flynn , Vice Admiral Robert Harward , turned him down . Harward ’s official reason the President that he could n’t devote his full attention the President the job     the President much like the excuse of " I ’m resigning to spend more time with my family . " According to The New York Times , Harward ’s real reason was Trump ’s Harward style and the level of chaos that has engulfed his White House . " The mounting evidence Trump an administration in chaos includes the withdrawal of the men appointed to lead the Army , the Navy and the Department of Labor . As they stepped away from prestigious appointments , these these nominees seemed , on one level , to have failed . However , it is also true that they may have escaped something worse .   these nominees the experience of Trump ’s pick for Secretary of State , the former ExxonMobil chief Rex Tillerson . Soon after he took the job , Tillerson was publicly humiliated when Trump refused to the former ExxonMobil chief Rex Tillerson him pick Elliott Abrams Trump be his deputy he Trump also undercut the secretary Elliott Abrams he failed Trump consult him Secretary of State longstanding Trump policy in favor Trump Palestinian statehood . Although the position of secretary of state is widely considered the most prestigious in any cabinet , Tillerson has been upstaged by Trump ’s        Jared Kushner and by Trump Trump Steve Bannon . Trump also took Trump unusual step of adding Bannon to Trump principals group of the National Security Council , a Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon never previously granted a chief White House political aide .        Like Spicer , Tillerson is on the losing side of a bargain he made with a leader he may not understand . Here it Tillerson to become familiar with Tillerson work of Northwestern University psychologist Dan P. McAdams , who has studied the personalities of presidents including Trump , whom he views an as extreme example of the dominance style deployed by alpha chimpanzees . Leadership by dominance is more primal than the other main kind of leadership , which is based on expertise .   Although previous Presidents have displayed a mix of these two styles , Trump is almost all about dominance . It ’s likely that the Trump who declined his job offers sensed Trump President ’s lack of respect for their Trump and the conditional quality of his support . Extremely dominant the people who declined his job offers consider loyalty a    street and Trump abandon partners in favor of a better deal . Witness the fate of Michael Flynn . The dominance mode explains Trump ’s bluster , bullying and tendency to dismiss people who have genuine experience . As McAdams told me this week , Trump " has no respect for , or interest in , expertise Trump’s kind , writing it off as weakness and the providence of elites . " This is Trump’s mindset that led Trump to put some agencies     like the Environmental Protection Agency , Department Trump’s Energy and the Department of Education     under the control of people who either knew little of what these organizations did or , in some cases , are hostile to their missions .    Among Trump ’s first appointees , Spicer may have these organizations the greatest relevant expertise Trump’s with the smallest measure of dominance behavior . To witness his struggle is to witness the dynamic that could cause chaos throughout the administration . Modern institutions , including the White House , require expertise .    And in chimpanzee colonies , which McAdams notes " do not have    institutions , " the dominance mode comes with guaranteed chaos . " Things always end badly for the alpha chimp , " he said , who torments his underlings until the moment he is overthrown .
