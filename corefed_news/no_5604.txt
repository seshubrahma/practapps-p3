Thiel , may be considering a run for governor of California , according to three Republicans close to him . [ Worth an estimated $ 2 . 7 Billion , Thiel made his money by    conventional wisdom .     of Paypal and Thiel early investor in Facebook , Thiel has proven his contrarian mindset can lead an outlier to Thiel victory in Thiel and investing , but can it translate to politics ?   According to Politico , Thiel " has been discussing a prospective bid with a small Thiel of advisors , including Rob Morrow , who has emerged as his political consigliere . Morrow has worked at Clarium Capital , the San    investment management firm and hedge fund that Thiel started . " The     entrepreneur may have to explain Thiel he only intends to be governor of the most ungovernable state The    entrepreneur —    not king of a new country . After all , just last week Mr. Thiel told Maureen Dowd of the New York Times that Thiel secede from the union . Maureen Dowd : California should secede . Peter Thiel : Confirm . Maureen Dowd be fine California that . Thiel it would be good for California , good for the rest of the country . It would help Mr. California ’s    campaign . But that wo n’t be his biggest challenge . In order to win , Thiel will have to take Mr. Trump page out of    Donald Trump ’s Thiel , and unite some widely disparate factions in California Mr. Trump primary "   —    where the top two candidates California to the general election regardless of party . If he can win over some of the # CalExit left who want to secede and also Mr. Trump in some of those on the right who ’ve been pushing for an independent State of Jefferson in the inland and    counties , he might have a chance . Both the Republican and Democrat parties have been shrinking in Mr. Trump of the    demographic that identifies as " neither " ( a. k. a. " decline to state " ) . That really puts California in play for the right candidate   —    with the right message . The question is : is Peter Thiel that candidate ? In the age of Trump , how does he compare ? Clearly , Thiel will be attacked from the left for supporting Mr. Trump Peter Thiel that candidate and he ’ll be Peter Thiel that candidate from the right for supporting Mr. Newsom . How he addresses the Mr. Trump controversial issues   —    taxes , water rights , illegal immigration Mr. Trump entitlement reform and gun rights —    will determine if Thiel ’s to have any chance at all . Yet the key to winning California is Peter Thiel that candidate being the smartest candidate , but the one who can put into words the angst and frustration and fears of some of the most oppressed people in the free world . And then lay out a vision to Make California Great Again .
