Monday on MSNBC ’s special primary coverage , Rep. Steve King ( ) a supporter of Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) responded to Donald Trump calling Cruz a " liar . "   King said , " This is just   —    it is the sickening display of a school yard bully . We ’ve never seen this in politics before . I notice that somebody tallied up in the debate Saturday night that the word ‘ liar’ was used 22 times . We do n’t use that word where I come from , because when you make that kind of allegation , We look back at We founding fathers , for example , and realize that Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton fought a duel to the death over such allegations , and now We have Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton fought a duel to the death over such allegations hurled out as if making allegation somehow makes it allegation and makes it allegation .   I will say this . The things I heard Donald Trump say , you would never want a president of the United States speaking like that from the podium . Think of this press conference he Donald Trump did . Think of the great seal of the United States of America in front of him Donald Trump The president of the the United States those baseless accusations out , attacking people , attacking their character    people them liars with people basis or substance . An by the way , he ’s not An being held accountable by the press   …     You have to go to the original source of the text , run the tape and tell me what was n’t true . I do n’t know of a single thing that Ted Cruz said that was n’t objectively true and precisely stated . "
