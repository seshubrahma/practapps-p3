’   ’ "    Trump is exploring whether it can Trump an    obscure ethics rule to undermine the special counsel    investigation into ties between President Donald Trump ’s campaign    team and Russia , two people familiar with White House thinking    said on Friday . " ’    Trump has said that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’ ’s    hiring of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel    to lead the investigation " hurts our country terribly . " ’ "    Within hours of Mueller ’s former FBI Director Robert Mueller Wednesday , the White    House began reviewing the Code of Federal Regulations , which    restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their    prior newly hired government lawyers firm ’s clients for one year after their hiring , newly hired government lawyers    sources said . " ’    An executive order signed by Trump in January extended that    period to two years . ’ "    Mueller ’s former law firm , WilmerHale , represents Trump ’s       Trump , who met with a Russian bank executive    in December , and the president ’s former campaign manager Paul    Manafort , who is a subject of a federal investigation . " ’    Legal experts said the ethics rule can be waived by the Justice    Department , which appointed Mueller . He did not represent Mueller    or Manafort directly at his former law firm Mueller ’ ’    If the department did not the Justice   Department waiver , Mueller would be barred    from investigating Kushner or Manafort , and this could greatly    diminish the scope of    probe , experts said . ’ "    The Justice Department is already reviewing Mueller ’s background    as Mueller as any potential conflicts of interest , said department    spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores . " "    Even if the Justice Department granted a The Justice Department White House    would consider using the ethics rule to create doubt about    Mueller ’s ability to do his job Mueller’s the sources said .   Mueller’s Administration legal advisers have been asked to determine if    there is a basis for this .    ’    Under this strategy , the sources said the administration would    raise the sources in press Administration public    . ’ ’    Moreover , the White House has not ruled out the possibility of    using the rule to challenge Mueller ’s findings    court , should    the investigation lead to prosecution . ’ ’    ’ ’    But the administration is now mainly focused on placing a cloud Administration his reputation for independence , according to    sources       who spoke on the condition of anonymity .    ’    Kathleen Clark , a professor of legal ethics at Washington    University School of Law , said the Justice Department can grant a    waiver if concerns about bias are minimal . ’ ’    She said subjects of the investigation could later argue that its Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington   University School of Law results can not be trusted , but she believes the investigation argument would    not stand up in court Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington   University School of Law ’ "    The    House did not respond to a request for comment on    whether it is reviewing the ethics rule in order to         The White House ’s credibility . " "    Mueller ’s former colleagues at WilmerHale , James Quarles and    Mueller’s Zebley , are expected to join his investigation , according    to a spokeswoman for the law firm . Neither Quarles nor Zebley    represented Kushner or Manafort . " " James Quarles Mueller will now lead the ongoing Federal Bureau of Investigation    Mueller’s into Trump ’s associates and senior Russian officials . " "    Unlike Kenneth Starr , the independent counsel appointed by a      panel to investigate Bill and Hillary Clinton ’s real    estate holdings in the 1990s , Mueller depends on the Justice    Department for funding and he reports to Rosenstein , who was    appointed by Trump Mueller " ’ Rosenstein    week , Rosenstein    said Mueller will have " all appropriate resources to conduct a    Mueller and complete investigation .
