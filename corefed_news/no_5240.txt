Hollywood is on the verge of a massive boycott . And the Oscars may be the tipping point . [ If you know where to look , you can see this sentiment building . After Meryl Streep ’s Golden Globes tirade against President Trump , the # BoycottHollywood hashtag flooded Twitter feeds . A few weeks later , and just a day after the inauguration , Madonna shared Madonna thoughts of " blowing up the White House "   —    effectively throwing kindling on the flame . At the SAG Awards , following a long procession of    virtue signaling , David Harbour , star of the Netflix hit Stranger Things , vowed to " punch some people in the face . " Calls to boycott Hollywood promptly peppered the comment sections of conservative news reports .   Then , as rioters pummeled , sprayed , and set ablaze the campus of UC Berkeley in an attempt to cancel a provocative Trump supporter ’s speech , calls for a boycott spiked as Debra Messing , Judd Apatow , and Sarah Silverman seemingly condoned the violent uprising . Sarah Silverman went as far as suggesting a military coup . Understandably , many were bracing for a lecture come Super Bowl halftime . But a collective sigh of relief could be heard across the country as Lady Gaga did the now unimaginable   …     Lady Gaga simply entertained . With the Oscars under two weeks away , Hollywood media is telegraphing a political tsunami . Owen Glieberman , chief film critic for Variety , the industry flagship with huge sway over a movie ’s success , called on the Oscars to go political and inspire protest . United Talent Agency announced the cancellation of its United Talent Agency awards party to make way for a rally supporting refugees . Powerhouse agency    announced it Powerhouse agency    form a new political action committee ( PAC ) . Even a toddler could predict its Even a toddler . These numerous and concentrated developments have ignited an already present # BoycottHollywood tribal trigger that film studio    should heed . Tinseltown has survived past public resentments   …      but this time something is undeniably different . Film and TV viewers now have innumerable options   —    with some that completely bypass the industry ’s tollbooth . Simply put , the public does n’t need Hollywood anymore to be entertained . This shift has been brewing for well over a decade . From a peak of 1 . 58 billion , annual U. S. ticket sales have declined 16 % from its 16% high   …     or just over a quarter of a billion seats per year . This decline occurred while the population , number of theaters , and number of movies made annually all increased . The slide also started before the proliferation of social media , cheap flat screens , streaming services , and the like . A large segment of the American public is finding other things to do   —    and political lectures wo n’t help buck that trend . These political lectures also helped spark another , more nefarious behavior   …     theft . Evidence of this practice can be seen anecdotally in the comment threads of conservative entertainment media . But data also shows new genres of piracy taking hold . A 2016 report , written by this writer , revealed a renaissance in " stream ripping "   —    software that allows users to rip audio from streaming music videos . Thirty percent of Internet users report using stream ripping   —    an unauthorized downloading behavior riling an industry that has suffered a 60 % revenue decline from its 2000 high . A similar software is impacting Tinseltown   —    a       protocol called BitTorrent , with the most popular app being Popcorn Time . This software allows A similar software access newly released films and TV shows with a library that far exceeds any subscription streaming service , and at a much cheaper price   …     namely , zero . The eloquent user interface rivals Netflix , and is sending shudders down the spine of film underwriters . In 2015 , the app was reportedly being downloaded an astonishing 100 , 000 times per day . And remarkably , Popcorn Time has persistently evaded    efforts . So before breaking ground on these new political endeavors , Hollywood should rethink its political posturing . Hollywood industry is teetering Hollywood boycott by an enormous , fully engaged segment of the population that clearly has other options . As the music industry has shown Hollywood can forever    . And if this past election cycle has revealed anything , it ’s that Tinseltown no longer holds a monopoly on shaping cultural mores . So why risk it with political lectures ?
