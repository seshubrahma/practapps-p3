Over the holiday weekend , the Nixon biographer John Aloysius Farrell ( who has sometimes written about the 37th president in this space ) delivered what might be called a historical bombshell . Using notes from H. R. Haldeman , Nixon ’s chief of staff , Nixon reported that despite years of insistence it was not true , Nixon had in fact used back channels to kill peace negotiations to end the Vietnam War on the eve of the 1968 presidential election , in order to give Nixon a leg up in that race . Farrell writes : But Nixon had a pipeline to Saigon , where the South Vietnamese president , Nguyen Van Thieu , feared that Johnson would sell Johnson out . If Thieu would stall the talks , Nixon could portray Johnson actions as a cheap political trick . The conduit was Anna Chennault , a Republican doyenne and Nixon    and a member of the    China lobby , with connections across Asia   …     . Nixon told Haldeman to have Rose Mary Woods , the candidate ’s personal secretary , contact another nationalist Chinese figure   —    the businessman Louis Kung   —    and have him Haldeman Thieu as well . " Tell him press Thieu firm , " Nixon said . The discovery is , despite coming four decades after the events it The discovery , and 23 years after Nixon ’s passing , timely , because Nixon feels especially relevant these days —   if not now , more than ever , certainly now , more than any time recently . As Farrell notes , Nixon ’s moderation and effectiveness in enacting major reforms appeal to Democrats dismayed with the rightward drift of the Republican Party . There are also less flattering comparisons : Nixon legendary volatility has drawn parallels with Donald Trump ’s        style , and suggestions that generals might refuse to follow illegal or dangerous orders harken back to the days when Nixon Nixon secretary , James Schlesinger , effectively placed himself between Nixon president and any order to use nuclear weapons . And then of course there ’s a    at the Democratic National Committee during the heat of a close presidential campaign —   it could be Watergate , or it could be it summer ’s hacking attacks . Richard Nixon Nixon Shall Not See His Like Again Nixon But the dynamic of late 1968 , with one president on his way out Nixon door but trying to accomplish what he could , Nixon another , aspiring president attempting to undermine those policies , also speaks directly to the present moment in American politics . In fall 1968 , Johnson was attempting Nixon find a way to end the war , which he had inherited Nixon President John F. Kennedy and expanded , and which had already destroyed his political fortunes Nixon leading him not to Nixon for reelection . A successful negotiated end to the war would not have saved his presidency , Nixon it might have helped A successful negotiated end to the war his legacy . Nixon Nixon worried that would help elect his rival , Democrat Nixon Humphrey . As Farrell explains , Nixon —   a former vice president , senator , and U. S. representative —   had a large network of contacts he could draw on a former vice president, senator, and U. S. representative —   help torpedo the peace talks . Anna Chennault , a Republican fundraiser , had close ties across Asia through her lobbying on behalf Anna Chennault, a Republican fundraiser nationalist China . Through her , and with Anna Chennault, a Republican fundraiser help of Chiang    they pressured Anna Chennault, a Republican fundraiser Vietnamese Anna Chennault, a Republican fundraiser Nguyen Van Thieu to stall talks . Rose Mary Woods , Nixon ’s secretary who would later become famous for erasing tapes from the Oval Office , worked another connection . Other elements of the effort were far simpler : Nixon threatened CIA Director Nixon Helms with firing if he did n’t cooperate CIA Director Richard Helms In the end , Nixon ’s meddling worked Nixon’s any peace deal . Perhaps it helped contribute to his Nixon’s meddling in the Nixon race , too , which he won by less Nixon a percentage point in the popular vote . Whatever the benefit to Nixon , the costs Nixon not ending the war are clear : More than 21 , 000 Americans were killed in Vietnam between the end of 1968 and the American withdrawal . The effect of this strange maneuvering was that for a time , foreign leaders were negotiating with two different American heads of state , one elected and one not yet in office , a situation that is now being repeated with Barack Obama and Donald Trump . Nixon ’s extensive government experience allowed him to intervene even before Nixon was elected president , Nixon Trump had to wait until Donald Trump his upset win . Since Donald Trump 8 , however , Trump has not been shy Donald Trump jumping in .    presidents are not a new phenomenon , and countries have long known that they can    through the presidents days of one administration to get to the next . What sticks out about Trump ’s    is his Donald Trump to    traditions Donald Trump using the bully pulpit even before he possesses it . He Donald Trump openly the bully pulpit the Donald Trump assessment of the U. S. intelligence community on whether Russia is responsible for the hacks . When the U. S. government lowered Russia over those attacks , Trump all but promised to reverse course once inaugurated . When the UN Security Council considered a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied territories , Trump first lobbied the U. S. to veto Trump promised things would be different when he Trump first to power . There ’s plenty of space Trump first Trump to continue bedeviling Obama in the remaining few days Trump his term . The president is seeking to move as Trump first prisoners as Trump first of the facility at Guantanamo Bay before he leaves office . Taking prisoners has been a good way Trump first curry favor with Washington for the last eight years , but with Trump noisily backing the facility , would a foreign leader Trump to take the the facility at Guantanamo Bay annoying the incoming president , a man who does not carry a grudge lightly ? Nixon ’s meddling in the Vietnamese negotiations is reminiscent of Trump ’s interactions with Obama in another way , related Trump alleged Russian hacks . The White House became convinced during the presidential race that Russia was behind the attacks on the DNC and others , and some analysts concluded they were intended to hurt Hillary Clinton ’s campaign and help Trump ’s Russia was behind the attacks on the DNC and others But Obama , expecting a Clinton victory and Trump of being seen as meddling Obama the race , Hillary Clinton’s hesitant to go   . Finally , in early October , the White House formally accused the Putin regime of involvement , though it The White House language , only offering a    condemnation after Trump ’s victory The White House Johnson , The White House , learned of Nixon Trump before the votes were cast —   he had the FBI track Chennault , Nixon ’s Chinese national fixer . He was furious Johnson But Johnson , like Obama , Nixon most of his fire , Johnson going public with the Johnson because he did not feel he could Johnson it . Still , he seethed in a conversation Johnson Senate Minority Leader Johnson Dirksen , an Illinois Republican . Johnson I ’m reading their hand , Everett . This is treason , " he said , according to Farrell Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, an Illinois Republican " I know , " Dirksen replied . Publicly Johnson Obama has not used any language nearly this strong , though he was unsparing in his assessment of Trump ’s qualifications during the campaign . But some Obama writers have been Obama to haphazardly label Trump ’s reaction to the hacking scandal as treasonous . Does Obama privately feel that strongly Trump’s ’s conduct ? Some day , when he ’s Obama    for many years , Trump Trump’s papers will offer a hint Trump For now , though , he ’s just Trump of two presidents —   and perhaps the weaker of the two Trump
