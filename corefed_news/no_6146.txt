After years of imposed " scientific consensus " on global warming , a number of skeptical climate scientists are hopeful that a number of skeptical climate scientists views may finally get a hearing under the new administration . [ Georgia Tech scientist Judith Curry , for instance , labelled a " climate heretic " by Scientific American for Georgia Tech scientist Judith Curry contrarian views , sees a light at the end of the long Obama tunnel .   " Here ’s to hoping the Age of Trump will herald the demise of climate change dogma , and acceptance of a broader range of perspectives in climate science and our policy options , " Georgia Tech scientist Judith Curry wrote last month on Georgia Tech scientist Judith Curry popular blog Climate Etc . Part of the problem is that no one really knows how many climate change skeptics there are among scientists because of the high personal and professional cost of heterodoxy . Dilbert creator Scott Adams has compared climate change skeptics within the scientific community to " Shy Trump Supporters " who are too afraid to say what they really think for fear of being ridiculed or worse . As we can plainly see , Dilbert creator Scott Adams wrote , " the cost of disagreeing with climate science is unreasonably high if you are a scientist . " William Happer , professor emeritus of physics at Princeton University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences , played his cards close to the vest for years in order survive in a hostile scientific climate . " I held my tongue for a long time because friends told me I would not be elected to the National Academy of Sciences if I did Sciences toe the alarmists’ company line , " he said . As his political climate changes , however , climate change skeptics may find their voice and enter however, climate change skeptics debate that has hitherto been closed off to them . Happer , however, climate change skeptics instance , is more optimistic of what the future holds . " I think we ’re making progress , " he said . " his see reassuring signs . " Dr. Duane Thresher , a climate scientist with a PhD from Columbia University and NASA GISS , has pointed to " publication and funding bias " as a key to understanding how scientific consensus can be manipulated . Although scientists are held up as models of independent thinkers and unbiased seekers of truth , the reality is that they depend on funding scientists more than other professions , since much of their research has no scientists value . Thus , they will study what scientists are funded to scientists . The Obama administration , which doggedly denied that a climate debate even existed , funneled billions of federal dollars into programs and studies that supported its claims , while a climate debate even existed contrary opinions . " In reality , it ’s the government a climate debate even existed not the scientists , that asks the questions , " said David Wojick , an expert on climate research spending and a longtime government consultant . Federal agencies order up studies that focus on their concerns , so Federal agencies ends up guiding science according to its particular interests . politics Government actions have corrupted science , which has been flooded by money to produce politically correct results , " said Happer . " It is time for governments to finally admit the truth about global warming . Warming is not the global warming . Government action is the problem . " the problem who has done pioneering work in both tree ring climate proxy modeling and ocean climate proxy modeling , says that scientists know far less about historical climate than people are led to believe . Scientists us climate " proxies " like tree rings and ice cores , Thresher says , as substitutes for real climate measurements . The inferences reached are " inaccurate and unreliable well beyond what is required for the conclusions drawn , " he states . When it comes to forecasting future climate trends , however , the situation is even worse , Thresher contends . " Climate Thresher are just more    weather models , which have a theoretical maximum predictive ability of just 10 days into the future , " he notes . " Predicting he decades or even just years into the future is a lie , albeit a useful one for publication and funding . "    Donald Trump ’s choices for key cabinet posts have exhilarated climate scientists tired of being    as " climate change deniers " just because they raise uncomfortable questions . Tapping former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to run the Energy Department , Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma to run the Environmental Protection Agency , and Exxon chief executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state signals a radical change from Obama ’s conforming climate alarmists . Every friend of honest debate and free exchange of information will take heart in the changing environment , where every voice will be heard . In the area of climate science , the change could n’t come a radical change from Obama more opportune time . Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter   Follow @tdwilliamsrome
