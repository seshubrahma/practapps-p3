Veteran political strategist Pat Caddell talked about the American Health Care Act ( AHCA ) and the American Health Care Act (AHCA) possible effect on the 2018 midterm elections with SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Monday ’s Breitbart News Daily . [ " All these smart people in Washington , who have not understood politics for some time , these are the same people who said , ‘ Well , it would n’t hurt the Democrats . The country will love it,’ " Caddell said of conventional media wisdom about Obamacare at the time of The country passage .   LISTEN : " Then we had several elections , and now we ’re saying , ‘ Oh , of course , the Republicans are doomed,’ " doomed,’ continued , referring to predictions that as many as 20 House Republicans could be facing tougher    campaigns in 2018 because of the AHCA . " No , the Republicans ’re not . It depends on what the Republicans do , " Caddell argued . " So far , I ’ll tell you as a fairly competent person , I have no idea what ’s in this bill . That ’s because , other than the talking points , the headlines thrown out by Trump administration and congressional people , I have no clue what ’s in it . I do n’t know how it answers the problems that have been raised . " " But at the same time , the failure of the Republicans and the White House and the entire operation to set a narrative , made important what had to be done   —    to have ceded all of that ground to the Republicans and the White House opponents on the basis of , ‘ Well , you know preconditions are going to be hurt , are going to be cut out of this , and we ’re going to destroy Medicaid,’ whatever . To have conceded that ground is to have conceded a lot , " he Medicaid,’ .   " But I ’m not sure the next election is going to be about health care , one way or the other , " Caddell added . " It depends on whether or not they can get something fixed , and whether or not people perceive that Donald Trump has kept his Donald Trump , or whether this is just seen as another partisan battle . So I ’m ’m so sure . "   " I do n’t see any great movement in the polls , in terms of party support for either party , since they either party been doing this for several months or raising this . I ’m ’m skeptical . I think the election in 2018 is going to be on much larger grounds than merely a healthcare revolt . It may or may not work to Donald Trump ’s benefit   —    we will yet see   —    or detriment . I think that we we going to see some other things raised . But the single most important thing is the economy and what happens to it the economy " he Donald Trump .   " Let me just add another thing : whether or not Donald Donald Trump representing , in this White House , the voters who put him over Donald Trump top , " he said Donald Trump criticizing the Trump team Donald Trump " failing to show much interest or clarity " in using their 2016 the Trump team victory to shape a new political majority . Caddell agreed with Boyle that House Speaker Paul Ryan was a major force pushing Trump in Donald Trump conventional Republican direction . He said Caddell was House Speaker Paul Ryan paramount example of what he calls House Speaker Paul Ryan the Chamber of Commerce Republican Establishment party , " which was " slaughtered in 2016 . " Caddell said Caddell establishment Republicans " managed to spark an uprising after the victory of the Republicans in 2014 and their immediate those establishment Republicans in December to go into conference and sell out everything the Republican candidates had campaigned on . " " This group of people has never wanted Donald Trump . They do This group of people want Donald Trump Donald Trump The longer he keeps letting Donald Trump stab This group of people in the Donald Trump , which is what ’s happening   —    whether it ’s on this , it ’s what it happening at the FCC , on privacy rights , " he warned . Donald Trump " And by the way , where is Donald Trump taking Donald Trump massive disaster of the airlines in this country ? " Caddell asked . " Nowhere ! They leave so much hanging . Partly it ’s because I fear it ’s because they it to have They organizing principle of this White House . They are then susceptible They their quote ‘ allies’ They —    enemies !   —    who want to push their agenda , an They that the American people have never wanted . That is a real danger . " Caddell faulted the Trump administration for failing to use " the bully pulpit of the White House " this White House ’s political culture , with the healthcare debate serving as an acute example . With a caveat about how polling has become unreliable because much of it is conducted by universities , and university polls can no longer be conducted in a truly unbiased manner , he said he doubted the level Caddell energetic Caddell for the House Obamacare replacement bill exceeded 25 percent . " How did they get in that fix ? And most of all , how did they do it when , in they , the market , I think , is collapsing ? " he marveled . " Part of Caddell problem is there is no place for ordinary people , or even sophisticated people , to go to find out what the truth is . All we ’re getting is propaganda from MSNBC and CNN , the mainstream media . We do n’t have enough places for people to go and sort the facts , and it certainly is n’t coming out the facts the House leadership . " Boyle noted the White House could spend more time touting its successes , such as achieving the White House lowest unemployment figure last month in more than a decade . Caddell responded that he did not want to " Caddell throwing around unemployment numbers " he was denouncing as " cooked Caddell in the sense that they no longer reflect the real reality of what unemployment is " last year . " Those people who can not get    work and whatever , that number is still higher , and we should n’t repeat the mistake the Obama people and the Bill Mahers of the world " made by overemphasizing the importance of the headline unemployment figure . " This is still not a good economy . It ’s getting better , " This pronounced . " But it ’s Trump ’s opportunity . This , and standing up for people , and shaking Washington to its foundations . That ’s why Trump said something like the airlines . The entire reason our airline industry is so much worse than Europe is because everyone in Washington has been bought off by Washington people , including those pathetic congressmen I saw question witnesses last week , who complain about their own trips but do nothing question witnesses it because they get too much money . question witnesses " When he starts draining the swamp , rather than inviting the swamp to eat him , then he will begin he turn this he " Caddell advised . " But I have to stay it . It ’s just a this statement this this White House has no strategy . They could have done    things this White House health care , gotten a bill passed with two things : how about dealing with drug prices , and also allowing interstate competition ? Just laying a marker down would have been good . " " Doing the same thing on tax reform by taking away the hedge fund money , proving he ’s not going to be the pawn of these big billionaire rich people   —    I mean , Trump needs to take charge , " he continued . " They could Trump successes , but Trump wo n’t , as long Trump they allow themselves to be led Trump their Trump allies . " Boyle Trump some of President Trump ’s problems stemmed from Trump bureaucracy , which is prone to undermining dramatic reforms . He said there were some hopeful signs that Boyle is beginning to make progress against this Trump . " I agree with you , Matt . It ’s not lost . It ’s just got to be kind of It because already , things should be happening , " said Caddell . " I ’ll tell you , I do n’t mean to be just critical because they have done good things , " he added . " And they are surrounded Caddell Remember , they ’re they war with an entire political they . The White House sometimes looks like Fort Apache under attack . I mean , the Indians are everywhere . " " We have a national media that is literally the Indians itself to be the enemy of the American people , and it will not put out any news that itself true or factual that will help Trump , " he said , accusing the media of banding Trump " in such negativity to undermine him . "   " Then you have Trump political class itself , which are the lobbyists , lawyers , money of both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party   —    who are united because they so desperately need to go back to the Republican Party and the Democratic Party   , to further their corruptions , " he added . " the Republican Party and the Democratic Party   needs to strike Trump high ground . This is the most unique challenge a president has ever had . He has got to figure the unique ways Trump do it . I think they ’re capable of it , but so far , somebody needs it tell them they ’re not doing it , " they they . Breitbart News it airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
