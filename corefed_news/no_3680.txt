On Breitbart News Sunday , the Angel Moms who lost children or other loved ones to illegal alien crime said that the Trump administration plans to support a program aimed at helping American families devastated by illegal immigration put American families devastated by illegal immigration lives back together . [ Hundreds of    programs assist illegal aliens , but not a single program exists specifically to help American victims of illegal alien crime , American victims of illegal alien crime told SiriusXM host Matthew Boyle .   Organized by the Remembrance Project ’s Maria Espinoza , the Angel Moms described the immense emotional and financial costs burdening the Angel Moms families —   and government ’s complete indifference . " The national program we put forth —   Mr. Trump is the only candidate who met with we , of course , but also who agreed to support the Remembrance Project national program that would help with burial , medical , and counseling expenses , " said Maria Espinoza . " Also , what ’s very important that people do n’t understand that in so many cases , we families are being    because our families ’re being misguided in the court system . Either activist judges , or activist prosecutors —   so we really need someone to help and guide we families . " " Who can afford an attorney for someone to help and guide our families ? And here illegal aliens get one . If someone to help and guide our families murder an American , someone to help and guide our families are given two attorneys to protect two attorneys , to defend two attorneys , " she added . Ruth Johnston Martin , whose husband was shot by an illegal alien , said there is not one government program out there to help those suffering a loss due to illegal alien crime .   " Well , first of all , everyone listening has a family . Just imagine waking up one day and having one of those family members ripped away from you in such a violent and horrifying way . You ’re never the same . You need that counseling , " she said .   " You have to understand the depression that sets in —   these individuals need something , someone to reach out to . Someone that ’s going to circle the wagons around these individuals . That program will be that source . That program ’s a resource . And you know , That program is true —   there ’s over 300 programs for illegal aliens , " Martin continued .    " But there ’s nothing to help the families of those who have lost loved ones at the hands of these individuals . So these individuals do n’t have to suffer in silence . these individuals have someone these individuals can reach out to . "   " There ’s many that just go into a state of depression . There are some that commit suicide . There are some that go to drinking . It does n’t have to be that way , " she said . " these individuals need the assistance , and It ’s about time we had a president that says , ‘ You know what , you ’re an American . we ’re here for you . we ’re here to assist you.’ And that is exactly what he will do . "   Laura Wilkerson , who summoned the strength to tell the story of she son Joshua ’s violent death at the hands of an illegal alien classmate over and over again , said the trauma can leave one unable to live a normal life , or even do everyday tasks .   " When you lose a child , and the trauma that is involved with Josh ’s case , you are just absolutely broken to the core . You do n’t know if you can breathe . I mean really , it ’s a start to learn to breathe all over again and learning to crawl , and then to walk , " she said . " You feel like an infant . Your mind knows that you ’re not , but you ca n’t help but have the trauma with it . "   " I sat in the trial and watched this kid who was just excited about what he did to Josh , and he got up off the stand and demonstrated to the district attorney about how he strangled Josh , and he never had an ounce of remorse . And , this was two years after Joshua died , " Joshua said . " It was two years before It was brought to trial . And then you sit there and watch he just excited about what he did to Joshua . You ’ve never been faced with the evil , and with the trauma . " " My husband and I own a small business , and a small business ’s very hard to —   you know , you ’re scrapping and fighting every day to make it anyway , and you ca n’t do the things you used to do . And it takes you a long time to process that your child is not coming back , ever , and then on top of that to just do daily things . I could n’t make a meal for my family for probably about a year and a half , " she said . " You know something ’s messed up , and you just ca n’t do it . " " Everything becomes like climbing a mountain , and you really need help , " she added .   Legal immigrant Agnes Gibboney , whose son Ronald da Silva was murdered in 2002 by an illegal alien , said families desperation need lawyers in families desperation corner when fighting for justice .   " With this national program to allow families to have legal representation , so your rights wo n’t be violated in a court of law , " she said , adding she only had the prosecutor to look out for she . " Everything went wrong . I was not allowed to say my impact statement . I was not allowed to address a court of law . I was not allowed to get the probation hearing report . And when I called them to ask how come I did n’t get it the probation hearing report they them , ‘ My boss told me not to talk to you,’ and hung up . " Wilkerson said she paid out of she own pocket for an attorney just to sit through the trial of she son ’s murderer . " They them n’t want me to sit in the the trial of her son’s murderer and I had to hire an attorney just to make that happen . " she " could n’t imagine " not being present in the courtroom while others heard about the death of she son her son’s News Sunday airs weekly from 7 PM to 10 PM EST on SiriusXM Patriot 125 .
