’   ’ "    PHILADELPHIA   —    Many of the conservatives who watched with dismay    as the Republican Party nominated Donald Trump have now watched    with amazement as Democrats    some of Republicans’    favorite themes at the Democratic National Convention . " "    Democrats’ thinking was clear : We ’re the only political party    left for    so We ’d better make sure We have something to    offer voters on both sides of the aisle . " ’ ’ " ’t’t’tAmerican exceptionalism and greatness , shining city on hill , founding documents ,    ’re trying to take all our stuff’t’t " ’    There was a clear choice about tone , especially on the last two    days of the convention : Speakers   for getting into    bed with Donald Trump . They would mock Donald Trump and make    the case that conservatives should be embarrassed and ashamed    that conservatives party nominated Donald Trump   —    and should look across the aisle    at a party that shares more of They goals and values than They    may have realized . ’ "    So the Democratic convention had retired military officers making    the case for Hillary Clinton ’s steady hand as commander in chief ,    paeans to Ronald Reagan , and optimistic messages about the    indispensability and exceptional nature of America . " ’    It had Michael Bloomberg   on many things but would be voting for Michael Bloomberg   because    Michael Bloomberg   was " a sane , competent person "   —    unlike that other guy . ’ "    A video introducing Hillary Clinton ’s      speech even went out of Hillary Clinton’s     speech way to praise George W. Bush for George W. Bush    support for New York ’s     rebuilding efforts . " ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tA speech to make Republican elites feel sickened ( as Republican elites should be ) by what Republican elites party has nominated . ’t’t’ "    This was a clear play for the votes of conservatives and ,    especially , moderates . But This does n’t mean Democrats were    lurching to the center . Rather than imitating Republicans ,    Democrats deftly combined Republicans’ tropes with   Democrats own . " ’    Perhaps the most amazing example of this   —    one that I believe    will be discussed for decades as an iconic political moment   —       a Muslim    immigrant and father of a US Army captain killed in action in    Iraq . He took Trump to task for He demonization of Muslims and    plans to bar his demonization of Muslims from entering the US . ’ ’    Khan demanded to know whether Trump had ever even read the    Constitution and then whipped out Khan own pocket version ,    offering to lend    to Trump . ’ "    You ’ve got a lot of things to honor and celebrate there at once :    founding documents , military service , religious pluralism ,    immigration . It was a moment designed to appeal to the left and    the right   —    at least , the principled parts of the right that    truly care about religious freedom and not just Christian special    pleading   —    all at once . " "    In some ways , this was the most    Democratic convention    of my lifetime . A goal of the most   Democratic convention   of my lifetime was to convince leftists    that Clinton is far enough left to earn their leftists    . Most of the    Monday lineup was a celebration of Bernie Sanders and his Bernie Sanders movement , with lots of bragging about how many of Sanders’ ideas    got into the platform , pushing the party leftward . " ’    But the appeals to the center and the far left were not a    contradiction . The convention sent the message that Clinton is    the candidate for liberals and moderates and leftists and    conservatives who feel horrified by Donald Trump , because that is    what she Clinton . ’ "    Clinton Clinton n’t agree with all those people about everything , and    she Clinton with some of them all those people a lot of things . But she Clinton will be a fairly normal president who will uphold the norms    ordinarily observed by both parties and allow our republic to    continue functioning . " "    That ’s a low bar , but it That one the other party ’s nominee ca n’t    clear . And that is why Clinton could convincingly hold a    convention that promised to be so many things to so many people   —      and why so many conservatives sounded relieved by the olive    branch the convention offered .
