’   ’ ’    FBI Director James Comey said on Monday during a public hearing    before the House Intelligence Committee that the bureau opened    the bureau investigation into Russia’ ’s interference in the US election    in July and concluded by December that Russia had interfered to    " hurt " Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and " help " President    Donald Trump . ’ ’    Comey told the House Intelligence Committee that the    investigation , which " includes whether there was any coordination    between the President   Donald Trump campaign and Russian efforts , " was still in its    early stages and that Comey had " no timetable " for its conclusion . ’ "    But the FBI ’s opening of the FBI investigation coincided with a    flurry of events that increased scrutiny of the Trump campaign ’s    friendly attitude toward Russia . " "    Those events included a hack of the Democratic National Committee    in June that was attributed to Russia , an early      adviser ’s trip to Moscow in early July , a change made before the    Republican National Convention in July in the GOP platform ’s    policy toward arming Ukraine , WikiLeaks’ release of stolen DNC    documents in late July , and Trump ’s subsequent urging of Russia    to hack Clinton ’s email server . " ’    stolen DNC    confirmed in       it stolen DNC    been hacked , and the       firm CrowdStrike said that it stolen DNC    concluded with " a       high degree of confidence " that the hack was linked to the    Russian government . ’ ’’ ’    Shortly after the the hack made public , Carter Page , then a      adviser to Trump’ ’s campaign , traveled to Moscow ,    where he delivered a    speech at the New Economic    School that was highly critical of US foreign policy . Page had    served as an adviser " "    for Russia’ ’s    energy giant Gazprom before setting up    his own energy Russia’’s   energy giant Gazprom fund , Global Energy Capital , with    Sergey Yatesenko , a former Gazprom executive . ’ "    Page was in Moscow for three days , but it ’s unclear ’ "    he did    ’ "    whom he met with ’ "    and after the speech . Yahoo ’s Michael    Isikoff , citing a Western intelligence source ,   that Page had met   Page Igor Sechin , a    Russian oligarch and the CEO of Russia ’s    oil company ,    Rosneft . Page has denied   Page reports , but he resigned from the    campaign shortly after the report was published . " ’    In July , while Paul Manafort was Trump’ ’s campaign manager , an    amendment to the GOP’ ’s draft policy on Ukraine , which had    proposed sending " lethal weapons " to the Ukrainian army to fend    off Russian aggression   —    a stance that was generally consistent    with the Republican Party’ ’s position   —    was watered down to say    " provide appropriate assistance . " ’ ’    Manafort had advised the    Ukrainian leader Viktor    Yanukovych , whom he helped win the presidency in 2010 . ’ "    The language change was orchestrated by two      experts sent to sit in on a    subcommittee    meeting on behalf of the Trump campaign , according to one of the    experts , J. D. Gordon , and the original amendment ’s author , Diana    Denman , who was also in the meeting . As   the    circumstances around the language change are controversial , and    there are conflicting accounts about the reason for the change .    The policy    with the softer language was ultimately    included in    GOP platform . " ’    A few days later , WikiLeaks began publishing emails that had been    stolen from the DNC and the Clinton campaign . The timing    coincided with the start of the Democratic National Convention    the following week . ’ "    WikiLeaks did WikiLeaks WikiLeaks source of the documents . But the    emergence in early August of a shadowy figure who called himself    Guccifer 2 . 0 claiming responsibility for the DNC cyberattack    added to suspicions that the hacking and disinformation campaign    was linked to the Russian government . " ’    Guccifer 2 . 0 , who said he targeted Democrats in the heat of the    election last summer , has denied having any links to Russia . But    ThreatConnect , a cybersecurity firm based in Arlington , Virginia ,    has concluded that Guccifer 2 . 0 used the    virtual    private network Elite VPN to secure later communications with    politicians and reporters    ’ ’    Roger Stone , a former Trump adviser and longtime confidant ,     private messages with Guccifer 2 . 0 Guccifer 2 that were " short and innocuous . " ’ ’    During a press conference on July 27 , Trump called on Russia    Trump to hack his opponent . ’ ’ Trump " Russia , if you’’re listening Russia I hope you’’re able to find the you’’re 30 , 000 emails that are missing , " Trump said , apparently referring Trump to the emails that were deleted from Clinton’ ’s private email    server before it was    over to    FBI in late 2015 . ’ ’    " I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press , "    Russia added . ( Trump Trump a media frenzy surrounding    WikiLeaks ’’ release of the DNC emails . ) ’ ’ shortly after an " Access Hollywood " video    surfaced of Trump making lewd remarks about women Trump WikiLeaks    published the first batch WikiLeaks stolen from Clinton’ ’s    campaign chairman , John Podesta . ’ "    Seventeen US intelligence agencies concluded in January that    Russia interfered in the US election   —    hacking into the DNC and    Podesta ’s inbox and leaking the stolen documents to WikiLeaks   —      to undermine Clinton .
