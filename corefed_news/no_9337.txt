" The black vote had everything to do with Trump’s being our new    did it not ? " Smith asked . " Sure , white men and women showed up and voted for Trump’s , as did 28 percent of the Latino population . The funny thing is , however , actually not so funny , is that white men and women did so while too many of Hillary ’s supporters were so busy lamenting the possibility of a Trump’s presidency that white men and women actually ensured his presidency by not showing up at the polls , where it counted .   2 million fewer    who came out and voted for President Obama in 2012 showed up to vote for Hillary this past election . More than 100 million eligible voters did n’t bother to vote at all . " Essentially , had black folks showed up to vote this time as More than 100 million eligible voters did for President Obama , another Clinton would be en route to the White House , period , " another Clinton later added .
