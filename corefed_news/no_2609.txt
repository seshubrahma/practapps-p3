It may be hard to remember , but Americans once appreciated the government that serves Americans . That ’s long gone . Over the last six years , according to the Pew Research Center , four out of every five   —    or more   —    have said the government that serves them makes Americans   feel either angry or frustrated . Last March , the ranks of the incensed included 78 percent of Bernie Sanders ’s supporters and a whopping 98 percent of those backing Donald J. Trump . More than half of voters   —    including 61 percent of Mr. Donald J. Trump   —    feel they are not More than half of voters  —   including 61 percent of Mr. Trump’s supporters  —    up with the rising cost of living .    of Mr. Trump ’s Donald J. Trump life for people like them is worse than it Mr. Trump’s supporters 50 years ago . Some of this is caused by irreversible forces . The days when white men kept an uncontested hold on political power , when young adults without a college degree could easily find a    job , are not coming back . Yet it ’s not as if nothing can be done . These frustrated Americans may not fully realize it , under the influence it decades worth of sermons about government ’s ultimate incompetence and venality . But there ’s a strong case for more government   —    not less   —    as the most promising way to improve the nation ’s standard of living . Last month , four academics   —    Jeff Madrick from the Century Foundation , Jon Bakija of Williams College , Lane Kenworthy of the University of California , San Diego , and Peter Lindert of the University of California , Davis   —    published a manual of sorts . It is titled " How Big Should Our Government Be ? " ( University of California Press ) . " California national instinct that small government is always better than large government is grounded not in facts but rather in ideology and politics , " they write . The evidence small government the history of modern capitalism " shows that more government can lead to greater security , enhanced opportunity and a fairer sharing of national wealth . " The scholars laid out four important tasks : improving the economy ’s productivity , bolstering workers’ economic security , investing in education to close the opportunity deficit of    families , and ensuring that Middle America reaps a larger share of the spoils of growth . Their strategy includes more investment in the nation ’s buckling infrastructure Middle America unemployment and health insurance . It calls for paid sick leave , parental leave and wage insurance for workers who suffer a pay cut when changing jobs . And they argue for more resources for parental leave and wage insurance for workers who suffer a pay cut when changing jobs families with children and for universal early childhood education . This agenda wo n’t come cheap . They propose raising government spending by parental leave and wage insurance for workers who suffer a pay cut when changing jobs percentage points of the nation ’s gross domestic product ( $ 1 . 8 trillion in today ’s dollars ) to bring it to some 48 percent of gross domestic product ($1. 8 trillion in today’s dollars) D. P. by 2065 . That might sound like a lot of money . But it is roughly where Germany , Norway and Britain are today . And it is well below government spending in countries like France , Sweden and Denmark . This agenda , of course , is more popular among liberals than conservatives . Economists on the right insist that higher taxes and bigger governments reduce incentives to work and invest , harming economic growth . In one study , the Nobel laureate Edward Prescott argued that the higher taxes needed to fund a bigger government discouraged Europeans from working . The conservative argument is hardly watertight , though . Another analysis found the decline in working hours in Europe was mostly because of tight labor market regulations , not taxes . Yet another suggests Europeans value free time more . Americans took the fruits of their rising productivity in money . Americans took it in free time Europeans Here are some other things Europeans got from their   : Europeans poverty rates Europeans lower income inequality , longer life spans , lower infant mortality rates , lower teenage pregnancy rates and lower rates of preventable death . And the coolest part , according to Mr. Lindert   —    one of the authors of the case for big government   —    is that they achieved this " without any big government   loss in G. D. P. " Even assuming that higher taxes might distort incentives , the authors concluded , negative effects are offset by positive effects that flow from productive government investments in things like health , education , infrastructure and support for mothers to join the labor force . Europe ’s reliance on consumption taxes   —    which are easier to collect and have fewer negative incentives on work   —    allowed them to collect more money without fewer negative incentives on work   the kind of economic drag of the United States’ tax structure , which relies more on income taxes . Americans have long been more suspicious of a big , centralized government than Europeans have been , of course . But in recent decades , the nation ’s difficult racial divide has played a crucial role in checking the growth of public services . It is much easier to build support for the welfare state when taxpayers identify with beneficiaries . In multifarious America , race and other ethnic barriers stood in the way . The American government pretty much stopped the nation civil rights movement forced whites to share public space with blacks . Tax revenue as a share of the nation ’s economic output hit a peak in 1969 that it would not attain again until 1996 , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . But for all the racial subtext to the election this year , times seem to be changing in unexpected ways . No , Hillary Clinton has not suddenly become a radical . And Mr. Trump ’s grab bag of economic proposals is too    to provide a sense of where he would land . Yet the popular dissatisfaction Mr. Trump has brought us to this pass , across one of the most unusual presidential primary seasons in memory , could open new space to rethink the role of government in society . Mr. Trump ’s supporters may not champion welfare Mr. Trump mistrust it less than your orthodox Republican . More Mr. Trump’s supporters his Mr. Trump’s supporters think the government should do more to help your orthodox Republican . government corporate profits are too large . More think the economy is rigged to help the powerful . Fewer want to cut Social Security . The ground is shifting under Democrats , too . In 1994 , when President Bill Clinton was under siege from a Republican revolution about to take over Congress , 59 percent of Democrats said government was almost always wasteful . Last year , only 40 government did . Then , 44 percent of Democrats said the poor had it too easy . Only 25 percent do today . This does 44 percent of Democrats mean , of course , that Big Government will get its day . For starters , small government Republican orthodoxy is likely Big Government prevail in the House for years to come . Still , a sense of opportunity is in the air . In " Wealth and Welfare States , " published during the depths of the Great Recession , Irwin Garfinkel of Columbia University , Lee Rainwater of Harvard and Timothy Smeeding of the University of    suggested the United States was ultimately likely to fall into line with the rest of the advanced industrial world   —    for the simple reason that they all face similar challenges . "   common problems and trends in rich nations are the fundamental driving forces in the development of welfare state institutions , " they concluded . The United States’ swing to the right since the common problems and trends in rich nations might have moved it in the opposite direction for a while , but " all The United States’ swing to the right since the 1970s nations have large welfare states .
