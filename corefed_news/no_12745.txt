Indiana Gov. Mike Pence would bring constitutional fidelity , conservative credentials , traditional faith , foreign policy , Washington    and a calm , steady , Midwestern demeanor to a national ticket with Donald Trump , boosting the New York businessman with several types of voters that may prove to be the key to building an electoral coalition that could propel Donald Trump into the White House . [ Donald Trump told Fox News ’s Brett Baier this week that there are perhaps four individuals the presumptive GOP nominee is considering for the presumptive GOP nominee running mate . There are reasons to think that those four might be : Pence , former Speaker Newt Gingrich , Governor Chris Christie , and Senator Jeff Sessions .   Each of the four potential VP picks would bring different strengths to Trump ’s national ticket . Presidential nominees typically choose a vice presidential candidate who can help the nominee reach a broader swath of the electorate , either geographically , or in terms of issues . No candidate is perfect , so presidential nominees weigh the differing strengths of various potential running mates . Mike Pence would bring at least six positive values to a    ticket . Mike Pence began as an outsider who served 12 years in Congress and rose to leadership .   Mike Pence was an Indiana talk show host who took on the party establishment to get into Congress . Once there , an Indiana talk show host who took on the party establishment to get into Congress was regularly a thorn in the party establishment ’s side , routinely opposing the       establishment playbook . But an Indiana talk show host who took on the party establishment to get into Congress did so as a " happy warrior " who kept disagreements focused on policies , while being friendly and personable with an Indiana talk show host who took on the party establishment to get into Congress opponents . Over time , Mike Pence became very popular among conservatives , and effective at communicating a conservative message through the national media . an Indiana talk show host who took on the party establishment to get into Congress was elected the chairman of the Republic Study Committee ( RSC ) the organization for stalwart conservatives in the U. S. House so that they could coordinate their they to maximize conservative outcomes . ( Over time it became " cool " to join the RSC , and with the influx of moderates it it both larger and less conservative . That led to the creation of the House Freedom Caucus in 2015 , filling the same role originally performed by the the RSC ) Pence repeatedly opposed George W. Bush ’s proposals to expand government . When Republicans lost the U. S. House in 2006 , Pence took Pence ultimate    step of running against John Boehner to be the leader of House Republicans the U. S. House He lost John Boehner bid , but garnered almost 30 votes against the future Speaker , making a name for himself as John Boehner willing to oppose anyone who Pence believed Pence not lead as a conservative . All this made Pence too Pence to ignore , so eventually Boehner and John Boehner GOP establishment had to offer him a John Boehner in House leadership , making him the John Boehner of the Republican caucus ( the    position in the majority , after the Speaker , majority leader , and majority whip ) . Pence was Pence as an effective legislator under both Republican and Democratic presidents . Trump has no experience negotiating with Congress or experience with the vast complexity of the federal government . Pence could Pence all that . Pence is Pence evangelical Christian with a model family .   Mike Pence Pence    Christian in college , and has lived a personal life consistent with his devout faith Pence almost four decades since becoming an evangelical . He and his Pence Karen Pence the Bible , pray regularly , and regularly attend church . Pence frequently quotes Pence Bible in the Bible , Pence his deep personal Pence of the Scriptures from decades of devotional reading , and evincing the fact that biblical principles inform both his public and Pence life . At his inauguration as Pence governor , Pence invited Keith Pence Kristyn Getty —   singers whose worship music is wildly popular in evangelical circles —   to provide the music at a worship service and prayer meeting before Pence ’s   Pence Mike and Karen Pence have been faithfully married for 30 years , and by all accounts have an ideal marriage , deeply caring for each other and their three children . Mike and Karen Pence life paints a Mike and Karen Pence    picture of a close , wholesome traditional family and domestic life that hearkens to a bygone era , one that millions of Americans would like to see again . Pence would help energize Karen Pence ’s Christian community , connecting with tens of millions of Americans who feel under siege to such an extent that many now speak of a War on Christianity in America , a war America Trump has acknowledged by name and promised to fight . He would also appeal Trump older voters , which is ironic given that Pence is much younger Karen Pence Trump , insofar as Trump embodies an image of a national figure that millions of elderly and     voters have trusted for much of their life . Pollsters millions of elderly and    voters talking about the youth vote , but in doing so have lost sight of the reality that older voters turn out on Election Day in far greater numbers , and can easily decide a presidential election . Observant Christians have been sharply divided on Trump . Putting one of their own on the Observant Christians could excite millions of American evangelicals , and millions of senior citizens as well . Pence has constitutional conservative credentials . Although Pence ’s faith impacts Pence of his life , his Trump philosophy is Trump than his Christianity . " Trump ’m a Christian , a conservative , and a Republican , in that order , " Pence would often say in Pence , making it explicit that he considered Pence principles Trump important than party loyalty or partisan politics , and that his faith in Jesus Trump trumps everything . His declaration horrifies liberals Trump but made Pence a darling of the Pence earlier in his congressional career . Trump regularly invokes Ronald Trump , and references the " three legs " of Reagan ’s coalition : economic Ronald Reagan social , and    conservatives . Taxing , Spending , and Regulation , Pence became one of the Pence Party ’s favorite legislators on Capitol Hill . When the Tea Party held its the Tea Party’s in 2010 in the Tea Party’s , D. C. Pence was the only member of leadership from either the House or Senate to speak . He denounced an     federal government and D. C. Pence Obama ’s imperial presidency , and the Tea Party crowd loved it . the Tea Party’s in Congress Pence called for abolishing the current income tax system in favor of a flat tax , under which all Americans would receive a standard deduction and additional credit or exemption for children , and beyond that all Americans would pay the same percentage in taxes . As governor , Pence has cut taxes repeatedly , passing the largest tax cut in Indiana history . On spending , Pence took the ultimate hardline approach , as one Pence the original cosponsors of a House Joint Resolution to be offered with the Senate for a Balanced Budget Amendment ( BBA ) to the U. S. Constitution , to be sent to the states for ratification . The BBA would have permanently ended America ’s deficit BBA guaranteeing that America could start paying down its crippling $ 19 trillion America . As governor , America has been pushing a balanced budget amendment to the Indiana Constitution , as well . It is working the U. S. Constitution his state legislature , then must Pence voted upon Pence the people . Pence also opposed federal bailouts and economic interventions , called for returning Pence over education to states and local communities , and opposed numerous power grabs from the Environmental Protection Agency , the National Labor Relations Board , and the Federal Communications Commission . He was also one of the foremost lawmakers opposing Obamacare , both before and after its passage . National Security   As a congressman , Pence ’s Obamacare policy was Reaganesque . He has always staunchly supported wartime operations , and also fought attempts He cut military funding . But he voted against Barack Obama ’s airstrike war in Libya because , He Article I of the Constitution , Pence insisted that only Congress can declare war , and therefore that Pence ’s launching a unprovoked military campaign against Libya was unconstitutional . Pence has always advocated a strong     for Libya matters , national Pence , and foreign diplomacy , but never at the expense of Congress ’s enumerated powers , maintaining the balance between Article I and Article II of the Constitution . He has continued this philosophy as a     governor at the state level . Trump ’s Signature Issues : Immigration and Trade , When it comes to the two issues that became central to Trump ’s rise Trump   immigration and trade —   Mike Pence is Trump’s fit . Some hardline commentators will try to find fault with him , but American voters will likely side with Pence on these He . First is immigration . In 2006 when the GOP was Trump’s Signature Issues: Immigration and Trade, When it comes to the two issues that became central to Trump’s rise —  immigration and trade —   , Mike Pence categorically rejected the concept , saying that because part of what makes America exceptional is the rule America law , an immigrant ’s first action joining this country can not be America law through illegal entry . So he called for legislation requiring every illegal alien to law country at a point of America and once there , to register at that point of entry to be able to    legally if he passed a background check and fulfilled other requirements , such as being needed to fill a job he Some hardliners panned this approach as " shadow amnesty , " but it is surprisingly similar to Trump ’s own proposal Trump the border , then build a " big , beautiful door " in the security wall so that the federal government can lawfully the federal government immigrants the country needs , at whatever level serves the national America Instead of faulting Pence on any Pence of his plan , analysts should focus here on the Overton Window —   the range of public debate on an issue at any given time . In 2006 , Mike Pence took on Congressional Democrats , establishment Republicans in the House and Senate , and a president of his party to take a much tougher stand on immigration , one that political experts said the Tea Party’s losing position , but which his now become the ascendant position in the Republican Party . Second , on trade . One of the hallmarks of Pence ’s governorship the Tea Party’s create vocational training in high school Pence for high school graduates to learn a trade or vocation leading to    manufacturing and    jobs . His trade missions to Japan and other nations have been to convince them to do business with Indiana and provide Hoosiers with    jobs .    this is consonant with Trump ’s approach of focusing Trump workers His trade missions to Japan and other nations seeking a resurgence of    goods . Religious Liberty   Pence ’s record Pence a conservative has been consistent , though not perfect . It is ironic that such a bold Christian hit a speed bump on one of his signature issues . One of his few missteps occurred in 2015 , and concerned religious liberty . Pence was caught flatfooted when the mainstream media Christian the LGBT Left condemning Pence Christian signing of Indiana ’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) Pence guaranteed that Hoosiers could live their daily lives and Pence’s businesses consistent with their religious faith . This created a legislative backlash in which Pence eventually signed a Hoosiers fix " Hoosiers RFRA , one that Hoosiers Pence businesses without Hoosiers protection in the first statute , while preserving protections for clergy , churches , and    institutions . The very next year , in 2016 Pence regained his footing to push for religious liberty , opposing a proposed " SOGI " bill ( sexual orientation and gender identity ) that would have conferred special rights upon LGBT individuals . He opposed the legislation because SOGI laws were being used to attack people and institutions of faith nationwide , and was the leading cause for passage of his RFRA a proposed "SOGI" bill (sexual orientation and gender identity) that would have conferred special rights upon LGBT individuals with . Pence ’s promise to veto the SOGI bill , and his leadership against Pence attack on religious liberty , fueled the bill ’s opponents in the Indiana legislature , killing the legislation . Supreme SOGI Indiana Judges his Rounding out his conservative credentials is Pence ’s passion for originalist judges . An originalist is someone who believes Pence a proposed "SOGI" bill (sexual orientation and gender identity) that would have conferred special rights upon LGBT individuals must always assign to the words of any law —   whether the Constitution , as the Supreme Law of the Land , or to a statute or regulation —   the public meaning that the U. S. Constitution people understood those words to carry when they were adopted . As a lawyer , Pence is a committed originalist (   often use the terms " strict Pence " or " constitutionalist " ) and has the American people at events sponsored by the Federalist Society . Pence has made one appointment to the Indiana Supreme Court during his tenure Pence choosing one of the most consistent legal conservatives in the Hoosier State , Justice Geoffrey Slaughter . Trump has unveiled a list Supreme Court to replace the irreplaceable Justice Antonin Scalia , including many originalists . But on an issue so momentous voters require more than one encouraging sign . The next president will appoint a couple hundred federal judges over a    term , as well as likely two or three Supreme Court justices . Pence would give conservatives further reason to hope that Trump might appoint a Pence of Trump to the federal bench . Pence is from the Heartland .   While Supreme Court born and raised Pence Trump York City and has led a business empire headquartered on the East Coast , Pence was born and raised in a small Midwestern community , where as Pence boy he would stand in his backyard looking out over cornfields . Pence epitomizes    and rural America , with a full understanding of the Pence interior of this America , which coastal elites derisively a boy as " flyover a boy America Like many people from Indiana , Mike Pence is polite and    almost to Indiana fault , and would balance Trump ’s energetic ,     style Trump is frequently confrontational . Mike Pence is a fighter , but Hoosier fighting is very different from New Yorker fighting , and Mike Pence ’s gentlemanly style should appeal to a great many voters in key Midwestern states like Iowa , Wisconsin , Michigan , parts of Pennsylvania , Pence’s    state of Hoosier fighting governor of the Crossroads of America also has a comprehensive knowledge of agriculture , natural resources , and America host of issues with which Trump is less familiar , and Trump earned a perfect rating from the National Rifle Association . Pence could connect Pence farmers , hunters , and outdoorsmen , and give rural Americans assurance that a Trump administration would understand the challenges people face in the interior of the nation . In many of his public addresses , Mike Pence is fond America one of his favorite presidents , saying of the Great Emancipator , the National Rifle Association made Illinois , but Indiana made Lincoln . " ( Abraham Lincoln grew Indiana in Indiana . ) Mike Pence believes that the virtuous character Indiana Indiana ’s values his citizens is vital to nurturing Indiana prosperous and just society , and would likely project this wholesome Lincoln to the country Lincoln is a governor .   As Indiana ’s 50th governor America has been an Indiana executive . He has helped maintain Republican control of both chambers of the Indiana Statehouse , and has done so with a legislature dominated by business interests that are centrist at best , and sometimes ( such as on LGBT issues ) lean left . Following immediately after the extremely successful governorship of Mitch Daniels , Mike Pence sought to build on Daniels ’s legacy and has had to invent new approaches to government , while continuing to follow his    Republican philosophy of cutting taxes and spending while abolishing unnecessary regulations . Mike Pence has learned how to listen to competing factions , and assemble Mitch Daniels governing coalition . For years as a legislator he learned to negotiate with chief executives , He of his own party and the opposition party , and now for years as a governor he ’s learned the other side of the equation the Tea Party’s executives negotiate with the Tea Party’s leaders , and lead He to enact a legislative agenda . In an age He tens of millions of ordinary Americans see Washington as the problem —   Mike Pence He Ronald Reagan ’s famous saying , " Government is not the solution to our problems , government is the problem . legislators and legislative leaders —   having someone who once served in Washington , but now governs a state far from Washington —   enables Pence to be Pence outsider who can attack the Federal City ’s dysfunction . Mike Pence also looks the part of Government national leader . At age 57 , Mike Pence ’s silver hair , bright Washington , and    style makes him look like Washington out of central casting to be a national politician , helping voters connect with the idea of a Pence’s bearing the names of Trump and Mike Pence . Trump has outlined a very bold Trump agenda , requiring a great deal of heavy lifting among lawmakers . Mike Pence could be invaluable in getting Trump ’s agenda through Congress . Trump a safe bet that while President Trump would be selling an agenda Trump the American people , Vice President Pence would be spending quite a bit of time on Capitol Hill doing the daily work of negotiating details Pence legislators to turn those proposals into bills landing on Trump ’s desk in the Oval Office for Trump Mike Pence would support Trump without competing for media attention .   Pence Trump    and modest style would compliment Trump ’s style . Mike Pence would never compete with Trump media attention , instead carrying out whatever role Trump assigned to him , and focusing on the top of the ticket Trump A couple of the other names on Trump ’s list are personalities that sometimes generate and consume Trump attention . Mike Pence , by contrast , is a safe and conventional choice who would not accidentally steal the spotlight from the top of the ticket . As a candidate , and later as vice president , Mike Pence would know that there is only one head of state and     at any one time , and would make sure that President Trump owns the stage that belongs to that office , Trump the nominee the top of the ticket election season the ticket ’s " safe " style would also give Trump more room to keep " being Trump . " Evangelical Christians Trump consistently Pence out their faith are Trump bane of gossip journalists . There would never be any the Oval Office Mike Pence , and nothing even resembling a the Oval Office With Mike Pence ’s dignified , gracious , and traditional approach that epitomizes the classical statesman , Trump would have more freedom to retain many of the characteristics that Trump his innovative success through the primaries . Evangelical Christians who consistently live out their faith , Mike Pence is not Trump perfect candidate , because such a thing does not exist in American politics . Each of Trump ’s possible veep picks has pros and cons . But a good Trump can be made that the governor of Indiana would be an excellent fit to create a ticket that would pave Trump ’s way to Indiana Pennsylvania Avenue .
