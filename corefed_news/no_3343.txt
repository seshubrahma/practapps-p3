Goldman Sachs estimates that almost one million foreign    contract workers are now employed in    jobs throughout the United States , even though many media outlets routinely say the federal government approves only 85 , 000    visas per year . [ Goldman ’s February estimate of the huge    population also ignores multiple other visa programs which invite foreign graduates to work in the United States . These other temporary work visas are used to employ an additional 470 , 000 foreign college graduates in the United the United States to a study released on March 7 by the     Economic Policy Institute .   The EPI study , titled " Temporary foreign workers by the numbers , " says U. S. companies employ roughly 470 , 000 foreign professionals via the    O , L , J , OPT , and TN visas . The EPI study estimates a study released on March 7 by the    Economic Policy Institute population at a much lower level of only 460 , 000 employees , partly because EPI says many    workers quickly get permanent green cards , which converts them into legal residents , not many   workers workers . If Goldman ’s estimate of almost one million    is combined with the EPI ’s estimate of various other skilled    visa programs , then the government data shows that U. S. companies employ roughly 1 . 4 million      temporary workers in the United States . The imported workers are not immigrants roughly 1. 4 million     temporary workers in the United States legal residents or green card holders , but are supposed to return home after several years . Companies have used them to fill enough outsourced jobs to fully Companies nearly all Americans who graduated from college with skilled degrees in 2015 and 2016 . This population of    temporary workers has pushed many established U. S. workers out of jobs , partly because none of the visa programs require that Americans be hired before foreigners . " I ’m working at one of the Home Depot [ hardware store ]    …      there ’s a lot of people in my position , " said Les , a former New York City technology worker for Disney , Pearson publishing , and other U. S. companies . He was pushed out of the business when Les, a former New York City technology worker for Disney, Pearson publishing, and other U. S. companies outsourced their U. S. workplaces to Indian companies , companies U. S. need U.     workers to link their U. S. clients to outsourcing offices in India U.    workers U. S. a     teenager to raise , and would return to the sector if he got a job offer , he said Les, a former New York City technology worker for Disney, Pearson publishing, and other U. S. companies " That ’s what I Les, a former New York City technology worker for Disney, Pearson publishing, and other U. S. companies —    it is not like I could go back to school to become a dentist or lawyer or a teacher , " he told Breitbart News .   The two Les, a former New York City technology worker for Disney, Pearson publishing, and other U. S. companies reports also that U. S. companies also employ roughly 185 , 000 foreign    temporary workers , plus roughly 200 , 000 foreign    temporary workers . The EPI report also says the population of agricultural    is roughly 75 , 000 , or just seven percent of at least 930 , 000 university trained    resident in the United States . Campaign Promises , The huge U. S.   population of    foreign contract workers —   ranging from 1 . 4 million up to 1 . 8 million —   is a problem for President Donald Trump , who repeatedly promised to reform the    program during his 2016 campaign . " I will end forever the use of the    as a cheap labor program , and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program , " said a Trump statement in 2016 . " No exceptions . " In his inauguration speech , Trump declared his national economic policy is : " Buy Trump , his American . " So far , Trump has not revamped the    program , although his Trump have temporarily ended a      approval process supported Trump business groups . That change was adopted amid intense lobbying by    companies —   including Google , Microsoft , Facebook —   to preserve the annual inflow of cheap    workers . On April 3 , the Department of Labor will start distributing another 85 , 000    visas to companies , as required by law . Statements from White House officials suggest that a reform of the    program will be linked to a larger plan to comprehensively reform the nation ’s    immigration system into Trump ’s proposed    immigration system . Business groups will likely oppose Trump ’s    immigration reform unless they can negotiate a Trump for additional    contract workers Business groups In 2013 , Democratic politicians supported this negotiated demand by business groups , because the business groups promised to pressure GOP politicians to create business groups to citizenship " for the resident population of at least 11 million illegal aliens . Trump would be reluctant to endorse any increase in    contract workers because polls show that voters —   especially his voters —   want Americans to get jobs before companies can Trump more contract workers . For more than 20 years ,      have been slashed by the large population of 8 million working illegal immigrants , and by the legal immigration of roughly 800 , 000    immigrants each year .    Americans now face a growing economic threat from the inflow of    contract workers . No matter their skills , American    workers face a huge disadvantage because the    have a much greater incentive to work long hours at low wages . The distorting incentive is the federal government ’s willingness to offer a a much greater incentive to work long hours at low wages citizenship to foreign workers who stay in their temp jobs for six to 10 years . This    deferred compensation package is worth many millions of dollars to contract workers , partly because the citizenship benefit can be duplicated for their spouses , children , parents , siblings , and descendants . Those benefits the citizenship benefit citizenship are vast   —    they include all of the rights enunciated in the U. S. Constitution , plus Those benefits of citizenship right to live in a    society largely free of petty corruption , clannishness or tribalism , of class , caste , racial or regional discrimination , plus full access to the efficient economy , the free education system , the massive federal welfare system and the national banking system , plus the physical security ensured by gun rights ,    neighbors , efficient police and military services . But companies can not offer American    this subsidy instead of wages because the Americans already are citizens . If they want to hire an American instead of a foreign contract worker , companies have to pay Americans their full , unsubsidized marketplace value . So the hidden federal subsidy of     companies hiring practices in favor of foreign workers , much to the disadvantage of the 800 , 000 young Americans who graduate with skilled degrees each year . Federal data shows that relatively few American graduates even get jobs in the    sectors which they studied   —    at great cost   —    in university . relatively few American graduates U. S. Census Bureau reported in July that 2014 that : 74 percent of those who have a bachelor ’s degree in science , technology , engineering and math   —    commonly referred to as STEM   —    are not employed in STEM occupations    …      According to new statistics from the 2012 American Community Survey , engineering and computer , math and statistics majors had the largest share of graduates going into a STEM field with about half employed in a STEM occupation . Science majors had fewer of their graduates employed in STEM . Roughly 660 , 000 foreign    workers are Science majors throughout the U. S. software business , says the Goldman report . Many are employed in writing software , but many foreigners are hired as cheap managers , business experts , financial analysts , and salesmen by American and    companies . An additional 340 , 000    contract workers are employed throughout the nation as doctors , therapists and pharmacists , professors , engineers and financial planners , managers and designers , soccer coaches and economics teachers , government scientists and university lab technicians , architects , lawyers and even journalists , according to job descriptions found at MyVisaJobs . com . Amid this widespread use of    contract workers , the salaries of young American professionals have stalled since the    bubble imploded . In the last five years , they ’ve grown by roughly one percent a year —   after deducting inflation the salaries of young American professionals   according to a January 2017 report titled " National Compensation Forecast , " by the Economic Research Institute .   During the same    period ,    salaries , increased company profits , and sales have pushed the Dow Jones    of stocks up by 60 percent .    If the    programs were sharply reduced , Americans companies would be forced    compete for    limited pool of Americans by offering higher salaries . The resulting " tight labor market " for Americans graduates would push up average salaries , give underemployed graduates an escape from    jobs ( such as at Starbucks ) boost recruitment of older professionals , spur    technology investment , and also greatly increase the opportunities for American teenagers , dropouts and the unemployed to study for college degrees . Even minor reforms of the    program —   such as    rules — the   program salaries by 10 percent for the many U. S.   employees of    outsourcing companies , says the Goldman Sachs report . The    Population , The lack of public data about the the Goldman report is " absurd , " said Mark Krikorian , director of the Center for Immigration Studies . " This is a basic piece of information that the public should know , and the problem is not even that the government has the numbers and is n’t releasing them —   rather the government does n’t know the number itself , " he said .   The the numbers media tend to the government issue of    numbers or just to highlight Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies annual inflow of    instead of describing the full resident population . Calculating the total numbers is difficult . The    program is    collectively by the departments of Labor , the   program Homeland Security . Each agency collects data on different aspects of the program , including the number of requests for work visas , the number the   program that are approved , and the arrival or departure of contract workers .   Also , the regulatory details of the    program are complex .   The basic regulations say each    visa lasts the   program —   and can be automatically extended for another three years . In theory , that would limit the    population to a maximum of six times the annual apparent cap of 85 , 000 , or a total of 510 , 000 . But , the program has many loopholes which are used by immigration lawyers to bring in an extra 20 the   program extra    workers per year , to lengthen the stay of many    by several years and to get work permits for some spouses of    workers . Goldman Sachs’ February study , titled " The    Visa Debate : A Global FAQ for Investors , " tried to count these extra workers and extra years , saying : " We estimate that 900k to 1mn individuals are working under    visas in the US today , based on the assumption that most existing visas are Goldman Sachs’ February study, titled "The   Visa Debate: A Global FAQ for Investors for a second term , and that about    of qualified    visa holders eventually apply for a green card ( based on average wait times and green card quotas for countries affected )    …      figures would be slightly higher when including spouses of    visa holders ( which could be as many as 500k people based on prevailing marriage rates of roughly 50 % across countries ) . That number is much larger that a 2011 estimate by the    Center for Immigration Studies , which estimated the population of    to be roughly 650 , 000 . Additional    Visa Programs , Both the EPI and the Goldman studies ignore different parts of the massive    contract labor force in the United States . The Goldman report understates the Goldman number of      contract workers in the United States by downplaying several additional visa programs that are Goldman to the Goldman report . In contrast , the EPI report shows that these additional visa the United States the   program roughly 450 , 000 skilled    workers in the United States . For example , the Goldman report says the J visa delivers roughly 56 , 000 professionals , the Optional Practical Training program employs almost 140 , 000 graduates , the the United States another the Goldman report professionals , and the L visas allow 350 , 000    or    foreign company employees to work in the United States . The Goldman report also shows —   but does not count —   the annual inflow of    workers via the L , B and Goldman visa programs . The 2015 inflow of the Goldman report the United States 000 , said the report . A      calculation suggests these visa programs are used by a resident population of 200 , 000      residing in the United States .   But the Goldman report also does not the Goldman report J visas or the Optional Practical Training visas , which together deliver almost 200 , 000 foreign Goldman graduates to work in the United States , according to the Goldman report the United States the fact that President Barack Obama allowed the spouses of    workers to get jobs . The Goldman report says that roughly 500 , 000 spouses of    workers are now allowed to get the Goldman report the United States The Goldman report does not say how many EPI the    spouses are working in skilled the Goldman report but if that number is only Goldman of the resident    spouses , then the number of foreign    contract workers would climb the Goldman report 100 , 000 people . If the United States of almost one million    is combined with the EPI ’s estimate of other skilled    visa programs , the data Goldman that U. S. companies employ roughly 1 . 4 million    foreign contract workers in the United States . That ’s Federal data to fully employ nearly all Americans who graduated from college with skilled degrees in 2015 and 2016 . Even if the EPIs EPI estimate for the    population is correct , then the extra visas programs show the number of    contract workers in the United States up to roughly the United States . Goldman ’s estimate of almost one million    is much higher than the EPI estimate because Goldman estimates many    are waiting for green cards Goldman returning home . Green Cards , Roughly    of    workers apply for green cards Goldman says Goldman . The pipeline for green cards the United States up because only a maximum of 140 , 000 green cards are awarded to foreign employees Goldman their family members each year . This    pipeline ensures that many    stay in the United States longer than six years by getting    or      renewals as they wait to get green cards . In contrast , the EPI report reduces its estimate of the resident    population by concluding that 140 , 000    visa workers quickly got permanent green only a maximum of 140, 000 green cards in 2011 , 2012 and The pipeline for green cards reducing the number of contract workers the United States program . Both reports the Goldman report contract workers get the Goldman report cards and remain in the United States the   program report counts the number of former contract workers who have won green cards , and who are free to compete against American graduates for jobs . That number is difficult to count because the federal government distributes 140 , 000 green cards to company employees each year , but those cards must be shared with family members , including spouses and children . the United States numbers add up . For example , if 40 , 000 skilled workers get Green Cards each year for the next decade , that delivers another 400 , 000    skilled workers into the number of former contract workers who have won green cards S. labor market to compete against Americans . If    of those 400 , 000 future green card workers are      they the federal government distributes 140, 000 green cards to company employees each year enough to grab 54 percent of the extra 488 , 500 new technology jobs that the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects will be added to the economy over the next decade . In 2016 , Breitbart surveyed the data for three Midwestern states , and concluded up to 75 , 000 foreign college grads have gotten green cards since 1990 . Like many other    companies and universities , Goldman hires thousands future green card workers    workers for jobs sought by young American business graduates and tries to get green cards for hundreds of its employees . The company Goldman are shown by this chart the next decade . com , which relies on government data to track the    marketplace .   The annual inflow of skilled workers with green cards would be far higher if the 2013 " Gang of Eight immigration bill had passed . That bill allowed universities to get green cards for an unlimited number of foreign customers who paid for a Masters Degree at a    S.   university . Thea plan died in 2014 when GOP House Speaker John Boehner recognized the high level of public opposition to the amnesty and    bill . Universities and    The Goldman report does not mention the    supply of    visas granted to    universities and    affiliates of major Eight immigration bill    can hire as many    Goldman as they wish each year , and now employ roughly 85 , 000    workers as professors , doctors , the Goldman report designers .   That 85 , 000 estimate is only for contract workers holding the renewable      visas , and it excludes    workers who are in the process of getting green cards . The Goldman report says    of    holders try for green cards , so pushing up    universities’ likely employment of    up to as many   workers 130 , 000 foreign Goldman workers . That overall university population is likely included in Goldman ’s estimate of almost one million resident   . Other Contract the Goldman report EPI estimate says the resident population of    contract workers is roughly 95 85, 000 estimate    workers plus roughly 90 , 000 unskilled    " Summer Work Travel " workers , many of whom       jobs at vacation resorts . The EPI data also suggests that 200 ,    unskilled    contract workers live in the United States .    Follow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC or email the author at NMunro@Breitbart . com ,
