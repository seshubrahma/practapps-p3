Wednesday on MSNBC ’s " Morning Joe , " Sen. Rand Paul ( ) said President Donald Trump has been " fed a bill of goods " by House leadership on the proposed House Republican health care legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare .   Paul said , " You know , I think that Paul has been told things by House leadership that frankly just are not accurate . Paul ’s been told this is the only vehicle , and Paul Ryan ’s been saying the only vehicle for weeks , ‘ the only vehicle ’s a binary choice , you either take the only vehicle , the only vehicle ’s my way or the highway,’ I think Paul ’s been fed a bill of goods on this thing , and I do believe that there ’s something that could pass , that actually would bring down insurance costs , but a bill of goods on this thing does n’t do it a bill of goods on this thing I ’ve fought against Obamacare for six years , I am a physician and I want to repeal it a bill of goods on this thing but I do n’t want to repeal it a bill of goods on this thing replace it a bill of goods on this thing something that just as bad or does n’t work .
