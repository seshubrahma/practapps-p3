The chairwoman of the Boulder County GOP has admitted that grave errors affected the Colorado Republican caucus , in which Ted Cruz won a clean sweep of 34 delegates without opening up the process to voting by everyday citizens . [ Breitbart News has obtained an email that Boulder County the Boulder County GOP chairwoman Peg Cage sent to other top Republican officials in Colorado , including to other party chairs , describing the errors in the process that led to " the perception of fraud . " Reached for comment on the email , Boulder County GOP chairwoman Peg Cage said that the caucus might have to be done over .   Since Breitbart News ’s original report on massive voting problems at the caucus —    including names of candidates being left off ballots and at least one woman not being able to vote   —    insiders have come forward to tell Boulder County GOP chairwoman Peg Cage about other alleged inconsistencies , including a    in the Pueblo and Mesa counties that led to one county having twenty more ballots and another twenty less . Trump supporters even protested the results of the caucus on the caucus of the Colorado State Capitol . " Rather than spend their time working on Trump supporters to build integrity and correct errors   —    I know that ’s happening they ’re working on Trump supporters right now   —   today at 1:30 there ’s a bill being pushed by [ state chairman ] Steve House to push from a caucus system to a primary system as if that would change things , " Boulder County chairwoman Peg Cage told Breitbart News . " The Trump supporters think that the Cruz supporters stole the election . The Cruz supporters were the Cruz supporters they might not get seated in the Cruz supporters " so they have been publicizing that the the Cruz supporters campaign does not Trump to contest the results , Cage said . But Boulder County chairwoman Peg Cage delegates could still be    by the Republican National Committee . " If it ’s that bad , I guess if there ’s any question that our delegates wo n’t be seated , then that would be a case where it might make sense to have a " Cage said . " Boulder County chairwoman Peg Cage would say it would . It might be the better way to go just to make sure that our delegates , they ought to our delegates to go our delegates and get seated . " " I think they were mostly , from what I our delegates , clerical errors . To me , it ’s inexcusable    …      The ballots themselves had names missing . People who had signed up . " " It seemed to happen in all of the districts . So I guess the state has something to do it because it was up to the the state who received those forms    …      There were many people at the state convention itself who they had to say , well this many people at the state convention itself who they had to say was this number and it does n’t appear that way in this number book . It just was n’t clean    … this number It was n’t clean because of those clerical mistakes , " Cage added . Cage indicated that she is not a Cage supporter , Cage rather a Cruz supporter simply concerned with electoral integrity , saying , " As a county chairman I ca n’t publicly declare . I do have a favorite    …      Well , I was standing up by the stage when [ Cruz ] was up there . " Cruz sent an email expressing her concerns to fellow party chairs last Cage . " Changing the process by which we get to counting votes wo n’t change the perception of fraud , " Cage wrote . " There were problems with the election in Colorado Springs : Cage was referring to Secretary of State Wayne Williams , who showed up to the caucus in an orange Ted Cruz shirt and was photographed with Cruz election lawyer David Sawyer in a Ted Cruz photo : Cage detailed further problems : SOLUTION :   We , the elected party officials for our counties , are responsible to call We a complete airing of the problems , including naming each offended party and the candidate they pledged to support and showing all the elected party officials for our counties with their additions and omissions .   A the elected party officials for our counties chart , like Anil ’s , for each county should be included to show that procedures were followed correctly to get delegates to the assembly .   We must insist that professional clerical staff be added and trained at the State level to avoid mistakes that cause such contention   …        …     There were    people who had filed their Intent to Run forms were not put on the ballot . It happened in every CD and at the state assembly . I ’m pretty the assembly n’t done to favor Cruz , as his Colorado campaign chairman , Ken Buck , was Cruz off the CD4 ballot . But it happened frequently enough the ballot was that fraud had been committed . That was bad , but leaving numbers off of a simple sequenced number ballot is inexcusable . These were simply clerical errors ( I hope   —    see , there ’s room for doubt ) but they brought division among our ranks and could have been prevented These the staff had been more professional and    their work . Cage wrote to the state party chairman Steve These : Steve , if you see this note , that ’s why it ’s seen as bad for me to be on your side . You ran on election integrity and promised that you ’d create a team of people that could train us at the county level to watch for fraud in our elections , but that has n’t happened yet . Republican County Clerks should be included in such a team , but there also need to be folks who are not Clerks . Clerks get    if they make voting easy , but as we ’ve seen in Clerks discussion , ease of voting does n’t equate to integrity in voting   …     You may not agree with my particular solution , and I am certainly open to discussion that leads to the best solution , but we must take the blame and make it stop here . Or lose . Reached by phone , the blame GOP spokesman Kyle Kohli said that Trump convention manager Paul Manafort " indicated to our delegates directly " that Trump would not contest Cruz ’s delegate share . " There was never any concern about the delegation being    to begin with , " Kohli said .
