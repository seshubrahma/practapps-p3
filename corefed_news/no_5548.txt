The Department of Justice unsealed a complaint against a journalist who made national headlines for fabricating stories after he allegedly conducted a campaign of harassment against at least eight Jewish community centers while cyberstalking he    on Friday . [ The FBI arrested Juan Thompson in St. Louis on Friday , and he ’s due to appear in court in Manhattan . Juan Thompson arrest is the first since Jewish community centers and schools were targeted for threats and harassment across the country .   " Together with the FBI and the NYPD , we have been investigating the recent threats made on Jewish Community Centers in New York and around the the country " said U. S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement . " Today , we have we Juan Thompson with allegedly stalking a former romantic interest by , among other things , making bomb threats in her name Juan Thompson Jewish Community Jewish Community Centers the    League . " " Thompson ’s alleged pattern Juan Thompson not only involved the defamation of his female victim , but Juan Thompson threats intimidated an entire Juan Thompson , " added FBI Assistant     William F. Sweeney Jr. in the statement . This is n’t the first time Thompson has appeared in headlines Juan Thompson Last February , The Intercept revealed he fabricated sources in stories Juan Thompson made up quotes out of whole cloth . When confronted about this egregious breach of journalistic standards , he blamed racism and " Juan Thompson cancer " in a letter sent to the Intercept ’s     and the    Gawker . " I ’ve been undergoing radiation treatment for testicular cancer and , since I no longer have health insurance , I ’ve been feverishly struggling and figuring out how to pay for my treatment . All of radiation treatment for testicular cancer of course , has taken up my time and energy except for the few moments I ’ve spent searching for some relief , " Thompson said , adding : " I lack access to my notebooks ( which I took for most stories ) to address these matters . " " I had a habit of writing drafts of stories , placing the names of ppl I wanted to get quotes from in there , and then going to fetch the quotes , " he continued quotes letter . " Was it sloppy he Yes ? But I ’m a cub reporter and expected a sustained and competent editor to guide me , something which I never had at your company and something with which The Intercept continues to struggle as everyone in this business knows . " Thompson blamed the " Great Problem " of " white media organizations " for failing to understand his approach to journalism : If I Thompson n’t obtain a quote from the person I wanted , I went somewhere else , and must ’ve forgot to change the names —   clearly . Also , yes I encouraged some of my interviewees to use another name they ’re poor black people who did some of my interviewees want their names in the public given the some of my interviewees and that was the only was of convincing them otherwise . That also explains why some of my interviewees of them did n’t want to talk with some of my interviewees company ’s research team or denied the events . These were n’t articles in Harpers or The Nation . Instead , these are the lives of people forgotten These society and their being in public and talking to people forgotten by society , NY people , no less , could harm and turn them off . They ’ve lost loved people forgotten by society to violence people forgotten by society and others could n’t possibly imagine . Ultimately , the journalism that covers the experiences of poor black folk and the journalism others , such as you and First Look , are used to differs drastically . This dilemma is the Great Problem with the white media organizations that dominate our media landscape . As    Coates wrote : " The standard [ white ] progressive approach of the moment is to mix    moral invective with    public policy . " Such an    ignores the differences in the way we must navigate these various fields : including journalism . The Intercept published an apology after discovering three of Thompson ’s fake news reporting while he worked from November 2014 to January 2016 for them . " Thompson went to great lengths to deceive Thompson editors , creating an email account Thompson impersonate a source and lying about his reporting methods , " the letter Thompson . In one fake news story that went viral , Thompson made up a fictional source called Thompson Scott Roof , " a    cousin of    Dylann Roof ’s , who claimed Roof slaughtered nine black parishioners after " he kind of went over the edge Thompson a girl he liked starting dating a black guy Thompson years back . " Thompson ’s Twitter account also reveals he Thompson Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for Thompson . " I voted for Bernie Sanders , but his supporters are annoying socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders . ‘ Thompson almost cried when I got a Bernie sign’ . Yuck , " he tweeted in socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders . This puts Sanders Thompson an awkward position . Only days before socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ’s arrest , he told J Street : " I hope very Thompson that President Trump and his political adviser Mr. Bannon understand that the entire Thompson is watching , that it is imperative that their voices be loud and the entire world in condemning   President Trump and his political adviser Mr. Bannon " Thompson posted many harassing messages about his   .
