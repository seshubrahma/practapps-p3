Thursday in Berlin , at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , President Barack Obama told the protesters over the victory of    Donald Trump to not " be silent . "   President Barack Obama said , " One of the great things about our democracy is our democracy expresses our democracy in all sorts of ways . And that includes people protesting . I ’ve been the subject of protests during the course of my eight years . And I suspect that there ’s not a president in our history that at some point has n’t been subject to protests . So I would not advise people would feel strongly or are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised during the course of the campaign , I would n’t advise them people be silent . What I would advise , what I advised before the election and what I will continue to advise after the the election that elections matter . " " Voting matters , " he a president in our history that at some point hasn’t been subject to these protests . " Organizing matters . Being informed on the issues matter . And what I consistently say to young people , I say it in the United States , but I ’ll say it here in Germany and across Europe , do not take for granted our systems of government and our way our live . I think there is a tendency because we have our in an era that has been largely stable and peaceful , at least in advanced countries , where living standards have generally gone up , there is a tendency , I think , to assume that that ’s always the case . And it ’s not . Democracy is hard work . In the United States if 43 percent of eligible voters do not vote , then democracy is weakened . " (   Politico ) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
