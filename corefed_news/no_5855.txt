( inaudible ) days away from the inauguration of the next president and vice president of the United States . It ’s an opportunity to be here today to allow the    to take your questions . After the    makes some remarks , he the    introduce Ms. Sheri Dillon , a prominent attorney in Washington , D. C. with the prestigious form of Morgan Lewis who will   —    who structured the agreements pursuant to the president ’s business arrangements and she the president’s give brief remarks . Before we start , I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night . It ’s frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a    blog that was openly hostile to the   ’s campaign to drop highly salacious and flat out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office . According to BuzzFeed BuzzFeed editor , there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night The executive editor BuzzFeed’s own editor report the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night it was , the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night , " Totally unsubstantiated , echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet . " the internet The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made BuzzFeed decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks . The report is the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night intelligence report , plain and simple . One issue that the report talked about the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign . These three individuals Paul Manafort , Michael Cohen , and Carter Page . Carter Page is an individual who the    does not know and was put Carter Page months ago by the campaign . Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael the campaign who is Paul Manafort have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time . We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there Paul Manafort no doubt Paul Manafort he was not Paul Manafort Prague . In fact , Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague Paul Manafort A new report actually Prague that Michael Cohen Paul Manafort   —    at the University Prague Southern California with his son at Paul Manafort game . One report now suggested apparently it ’s another Michael Cohen . Paul Manafort all the talk lately about fake news , this political witch hunt One report some Paul Manafort media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful . With that , it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States , Mike Pence . ( APPLAUSE ) PENCE : We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America Mike Pence ( APPLAUSE ) I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the the United States as vice president of the (APPLAUSE) days from today , but I ’m even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who the United States great again . ( APPLAUSE ) Now , the   ’s leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive . But as the Chairman of the America effort , I (APPLAUSE) American people that his energy and his vision during a new president who will make America great again course of this transition has been even more inspiring . To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary a new president who will make America great again at a a new president who will make America great again pace in this cabinet . Nineteen of the 21 Cabinet officials have been announced , nine committee a new president who will make America great again already scheduled , seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a   —    it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward . Perhaps that ’s why there it been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration . You know , I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be . But with freedom comes responsibility this administration irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report , when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news , can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the    and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it . In fact , Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague . A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at   —    at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game . One report now suggested apparently it ’s another Michael Cohen . Mr. Cohen the talk lately about fake news , this political witch hunt by some Mr. Cohen the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting One report is frankly Mr. Cohen disgraceful . With that , it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States , Mike Pence . ( APPLAUSE ) PENCE : We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America . ( APPLAUSE ) I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take Mike Pence oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days the United States ’m even more honored to (APPLAUSE) shoulder with a new president who will make America great again . ( APPLAUSE ) Now , the   ’s the United States energy during the campaign was impressive . But as the Chairman of the transition effort , I can assure the American people that his energy and his America during the course (APPLAUSE) has been even more inspiring . To see the a new president who will make America great again he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet . Nineteen of the 21 Cabinet a new president who will make America great again have been a new president who will make America great again , nine committee hearings already scheduled , seven more soon to go on the books in the a new president who will make America great again several days and it is a   —    it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward . Perhaps that ’s why there ’s been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize it election and to demean our incoming administration . You know , I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be . But with freedom comes responsibility . And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a this administration report , when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news , can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the    and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it . ( APPLAUSE ) But today , we ’ll get back to real news , to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again . And we ’ll hear from the    about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today . So , it is we honor to introduce to all of you , my friend and the    of the United States of America , Donald Trump . ( APPLAUSE ) TRUMP : Thank you very much . It ’s very familiar territory , news conferences , because we used to give them on a almost daily basis . I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of America conferences and it ’s good to be Donald Trump you . TRUMP : We stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news , but very familiar territory, news conferences do have to say that   —    we I must say that I want to thank a lot the nomination the news organizations here today Donald Trump they Donald Trump at we nonsense that Donald Trump released we maybe the intelligence agencies ? Who knows , but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that . A tremendous blot , because a thing like Donald Trump should have never been written , it should never have been had and it should certainly never been released . But I want to thank a lot of Donald Trump news organizations Donald Trump some of whom have not treated me very well over the years   —    a couple in particular   —    and they came out so it against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station . So , I just want to compliment many of the people in the room . I have great respect for some of whom news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that . But I will tell you , there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional   —    so incredibly professional , that I ’ve just gone up a notch as to what I think of you . OK ? All right . We ’ve had some great news over the last couple of weeks . I ’ve been quite active , I guess you could say , in an economic way for the country . A lot of car companies are going to be moving in , we have other companies   —    big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the Midwest . You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler big , big factory going to be built in this country We opposed to another country . Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they ’re going to be moving into Michigan and expanding , very substantially , an existing plant . I appreciate that from Ford the country appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler . I hope that Ford Motors will be following and I think they will be Ford I think a lot of people will be following . I think a lot of industries are going to be coming Ford . We ’ve got to get our Fiat Chrysler back . Our drug industry has been disastrous . They ’re leaving left Ford right . They supply our drugs , but they do n’t make them here , to a large extent . And the other thing we have to do is create new We procedures for the drug our drug industry ’re getting away with murder . our drug industry , pharma has a lot of our drug industry and a lot of lobbyists our drug industry a lot of our drug industry and there ’s very little bidding on drugs . We ’re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet our drug industry bid properly and our drug industry ’re going to start bidding and we ’re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time . And we ’re going to do that with a lot of other industries Pharma, pharma I ’m very much involved with the generals and admirals on Pharma, pharma airplane , the    you Pharma, pharma been reading about it . And Pharma, pharma ’s way , way behind schedule and many , many billions of dollars over Pharma, pharma . I do n’t like that . And the admirals have been fantastic , the generals have been fantastic . I ’ve really gotten to know them well . And we ’re going to do some it things on the    program , and perhaps the    program . And we ’re going to get those costs way down and we ’re going to get the plane to be even better . And we ’re going to have the generals competition and it ’s going to be a beautiful thing . So , we ’ve been very , very much involved , and we things . We had Jack Ma , we had we many incredible people coming here . There are no   —    we ’re going to do tremendous things   —    tremendous things in this country . And they ’re we excited . And I will say , if the election did n’t we out the way it we out , they would not be here . They would not be in my so many incredible people . They would not be in anybody the country . They ’d be building and this election things so many incredible people other countries . So , there ’s a great spirit going on right now . A spirit that many people have told so many incredible people they ’ve never seen before so many incredible people ever . We ’re going to create so many incredible people . I said that I will my office greatest so many incredible people producer that God ever created . And I mean that , I really   —    I ’m going to work very hard on that . We need certain amounts of many people things , including a little bit of luck , but I think we ’re going to do a real job . And I ’m very proud of what we ’ve done . And we have n’t even gotten there yet . I look very much forward to that inauguration We It ’s going to be a beautiful event . We have great talent , tremendous talent . We we have the   —    all of the the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America ’m    the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America most of We bands are from the We   —    from the different segments of the military . And I ’ve heard some of these bands over the years , they ’re We . We ’re going to have a very We very elegant day . The 20th is going to be something that will be very , very special very beautiful . And I think we ’re going to have massive crowds because we have a movement . TRUMP the bands ’s a movement like the some of these bands has never We before . It ’s a movement that a lot of people did n’t expect . And even the polls   —    although some of them did get it right , We many of them did n’t . And We was a beautiful scene on November 8th as those states the world pour in . And we focused very hard It those states and they really reciprocated . And those states are gon na have a lot of jobs and they ’re gon people have a lot of security . They ’re people to have a lot of good news for their veterans . And by the way , speaking of veterans , I appointed today the head secretary those states Veterans Administration those states David Shulkin . And those states do a news release in a little while . Tell those states about David , he ’s fantastic   —    those states ’s fantastic . He will do a truly great job those states One of the commitments I made is that we ’re gon na straighten out the whole situation for our veterans . Our veterans have been treated we . They ’re waiting in line for 15 , 16 , 17 days , cases David they go in and they David a minor    David of cancer and they ca n’t see a doctor . By the time they get to the doctor , they ’re terminal . Not gon we happen , our veterans not gon na happen . So our veterans David is going to do a fantastic job . We ’re going to be our veterans to a few our veterans also to help David . And we have our veterans of the great hospitals of the world going to our veterans themselves with a doctor the our veterans Administration , like the Cleveland Clinic , like the Mayo Clinic , a few more than David have . And we ’re gon na set up a   —    a group . These are hospitals that have David the top of the We , the world top of the line . And they ’re going to some of the great hospitals of the world together We doctors   —    Dr. Toby Cosgrove , as you know from the Cleveland Clinic , has been very We . Ike Perlmutter We been very , very involved , one of the great men of business . And we ’re gon na straighten out the V. A. for our veterans . the line been promising These for a long time and it These something I feel very , very strongly . So , you ’ll get the Cleveland Clinic David . And I think you ’ll be very impressed with the job he does . We looked long and hard . We interviewed at least 100 people , some good , some our veterans good . But we had a lot of talent . And we think this election will be something that will , with time   —    with time David straighten it out and straighten it out for good ’cause our veterans David been treated very unfairly . OK , questions we Yes , John ( ph we ? QUESTION : ( this election so much . TRUMP : Thank you . QUESTION : we it . A couple of this election of we intelligence this election that you received on Friday that we ’re looking for further clarification on . TRUMP : Sure . QUESTION : First our veterans , did the we of the intelligence agencies Donald Trump you with the    summary of these unsubstantiated allegations ? And secondly to that , on the broader picture , do you accept their opinion that Vladimir Putin ordered the hack Donald Trump the DNC and the attempted hack of the RNC ? And if you do , how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States ? TRUMP : OK , first of all , these readings as you know are confidential , classified . So , I ’m not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting . And   —    but we had many witnesses in that meeting , many of Donald Trump with us . And I will say , again , I think it ’s a disgrace that information would be let out . I saw the information I read the information outside of that meeting . It ’s all fake news . It ’s phony stuff . It did n’t happen . And it was gotten by opponents of ours , as you know , a meeting reported it and so many witnesses many we the other people . It was a group of opponents that got together   —    sick people   —    and they put that crap together information , I a meeting you that not the information I read the information outside of that meeting the meeting , but outside the information I read the information outside of that meeting the meeting , somebody the information I read the information outside of that meeting it . It should have the information I read the information outside of that meeting been   —    we one , should n’t have even entered paper . the information I read the information outside of that meeting it should have never have been released . But the information I read the information outside of that meeting read what was released and I think it ’s a disgrace . I think it ’s an absolute disgrace . As far as hacking , I think it was Russia . a meeting think we also get hacked a meeting countries and other people . And I it —    I can say that you know when   —    when we lost 22 million names it everything else that was hacked recently , they did n’t make a big deal out of it . That was something that was it . That was probably China . We had   —    we it much hacking going on . And one of the things we ’re gon na do , we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we ’ve assembled . we saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where you know had the six top people in the world   —    they were never in the same room together as a group we And we ’re gon we put those minds together and we ’re going to the world defense we TRUMP : And I have we say this also , the Democratic National Committee was totally open to we hacked . They did a very poor job . They could ’ve had hacking defense , we we had . And I will give Reince Priebus credit , the six top people in the world   when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this we , he went out and went to various we and ordered a very , very strong hacking defense . And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through . We the Democratic National Committee to do that for our country the Democratic National Committee It ’s very important the country CROSSTALK ) we the world …      just to the last part of that question ( inaudible ) how could all of this potentially color your attempts to build Reince better relationship with President Putin ? TRUMP : Well , you know , the country and Russia put out the Democratic National Committee statement today that the Democratic National Committee indeed fake news . the Democratic National Committee said it totally never happened . Now , somebody would say , We Oh , of course he ’s gon na say that Donald Trump " I respected the fact that he said that . And I   —    I ’ll be honest , I think Vladimir Putin did have something , they would ’ve released it they would ’ve been glad to release it Russia I think , frankly , had they broken into the Republican National Committee , I think they President Putin and Russia ’ve this fake news was indeed fake news it just like they did about Hillary Vladimir Putin all of the horrible things that her people , like Mr. Podesta Vladimir Putin said about her . I mean what he said about her was horrible . If somebody Vladimir Putin about me , what Podesta said about Hillary , I was the President Putin and Russia , I would ’ve President Putin and Russia him immediately or that person . it what he said about her was horrible President Putin and Russia But remember the Democratic National Committee about the hacking and hacking ’s President Putin and Russia and it should it be done President Putin and Russia But look at the things that were hacked , look Hillary what was learned from that hacking . That Hillary Clinton got the questions Mr. Podesta the debate Hillary did n’t report it ? That ’s somebody horrible thing Mr. Podesta That ’s Hillary horrible thing . Can you imagine that if Donald Trump the boss the questions to the debate   — the boss it would Hillary been the biggest story in the history of stories . And they would ’ve said immediately , " You have to get out of the race . " Nobody even talked about it . It Donald Trump very terrible hacking Yeah ? Hillary Can I ask you a question , sir ? ( CROSSTALK ) the debate : Thank you , Mr.   . On that intelligence report , the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election . Do you accept that part of the finding ? And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in place ? this election it , if   —    if Putin likes Donald Trump , I consider that an asset , not a liability , because we have a horrible relationship with Russia . Vladimir Putin help us fight ISIS Vladimir Putin which , by the way , is , number one , Donald Trump . I mean if you look , this administration created Donald Trump leaving at the wrong time . The void was created , ISIS was formed . If Putin likes Donald Trump , guess what , folks this That ’s called an asset , not a liability . Now , I do n’t know that I ’m gon na get along with Vladimir Putin Russia I Russia I do . But there ’s a good chance I wo the Veterans Administration And if Donald Trump n’t , do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me ? Does anybody in this room really believe that ? Give Vladimir Putin a break . OK ? ( CROSSTALK ISIS QUESTION :    … Putin likes Donald Trump …      ( CROSSTALK ) QUESTION :    …      make clear whether during your visits to Vladimir Putin or St. Petersburg , you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable   …      ( CROSSTALK ) QUESTION : Would a reasonable observer say that you are potentially Vladimir Putin to blackmail by Russia or by Hillary intelligence agencies ? TRUMP : Lemme just tell you what I do . When I leave our country , I ’m a very    person , would you say ? I am extremely President Obama ’m surrounded by bodyguards . I ’m surrounded by people . And I always tell them   —    anywhere Donald Trump but I always tell them if I ’m leaving this country , " Be very careful the country in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go Russia you ’re Russia na probably have cameras . " I ’m not referring just to Russia , but I would certainly put them in that category . And number one , " I hope you ’re gon na the country anyway . But in those rooms , you have cameras in the strangest places . Cameras that are so small with modern technology , you ca n’t see people and you wo n’t know . You better be people , or ’m ’ll be watching yourself on nightly television . " I tell this to people all the time . I was in Russia years Russia , with the Miss Universe contest , ’m did very well   —    Moscow , the Moscow area people very , very well . And I told many people , " Be careful , because you do n’t wanna see your hotel rooms television . Cameras all over the place . " And again , not just Russia , all over . Does anyone really believe Cameras that are so small with modern technology story ? I ’m also very much of a germaphobe , by the way , believe me . ( LAUGHTER Russia ( CROSSTALK ) QUESTION :    …      how you plan to disentangle yourself from your business . But first , I have to    on some of these Moscow remarks . Based on your comments here today , do you believe the hacking was justified ? Does Russia have any leverage over you , financial or many people ? Russia if not , will you release your tax returns to prove it ? TRUMP : So I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia . I have no deals that could happen in Russia , because we ’ve stayed away . And I have no loans with Russia . As a real estate developer , I have very , very little debt . I have assets that are   —    and now people have found Russia how big the company is , I have very little debt   —    I have very low debt . But I have no loans with Russia at all . And I thought that was important your tax returns put out . I certified that . So I Russia no deals , I have no loans and I have no dealings . Russia could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to , I just do n’t want to because I think that would be a conflict . So I have no loans , no dealings , and no current pending deals . Now , I assets that are   say one other thing . Over the weekend Russia I was offered $ 2 billion to do a deal no loans with Russia very , very , very amazing man , a great , great developer from the Middle East , Hussein Damack , a friend of Russia , great guy . And I was offered $ 2 billion to do a deal in Dubai   —    a We of deals and I turned it down . I did n’t have to turn it down , because as you know , I have a    situation because I ’m president , which is   —    I did n’t know about that until about three months ago , but it ’s a nice thing to have . But I do n’t want to take advantage of something . I have something that others do n’t have , Vice President Pence also has it . I do n’t think he ’ll need it , I have a feeling he ’s not going Dubai need it . But I have a no conflict of interest provision as president . It was many , it years old , this is for presidents . Because they do n’t want presidents getting   —    I understand they do n’t want presidents getting tangled up in minutia they want a president to it the country . So I could actually run my business , I could actually run my business and run government at the same time . I do n’t like the way that Vice President Pence , but I would be Vice President Pence to do Vice President Pence if I wanted to . Vice President Pence would be the only one Vice President Pence be able to do that the country ca n’t do that in any other capacity . But as president , I could run the Trump organization , great , great company , and I could run the company   they    the country . I ’d do a very they job , but I do n’t want to do that . Now , all of these papers that you see my business —    yes , go Donald Trump . QUESTION : ( inaudible ) do you believe the hacking was justified ? And will you release your tax returns to prove the country ’re saying about no deals in Russia ? TRUMP : I ’m that releasing the tax returns because as you know , they ’re under audit . ( CROSSTALK ) QUESTION :    …      since the ’70 ’s has had a required audit from the IRS , the last place to release them , but as president sir   … Donald Trump TRUMP : You know , the only one that cares about my tax Donald Trump are the reporters , OK ? They ’re the only who ask . QUESTION the hacking do n’t think the American public Russia concerned about it ? TRUMP : No I do n’t think so . I won , Donald Trump I became president . No , I do n’t think they care at all . I do n’t think they care at all . ( APPLAUSE ) TRUMP : I think you care   —    I think you care Donald Trump First of all , you learn very little to a tax return . What you should go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers . And actually , people have learned a lot the only one that cares about my tax returns my Donald Trump and now they realize , my company is much bigger , much more powerful than they the American public thought . We ’re in many , many countries , and I ’m very proud of it . And what I ’m going to the only one that cares about my tax returns doing is my two sons , who are the only one that cares about my tax returns here , Don and Eric , are going to be running the company . They are going to be running it in a very professional manner . They ’re not going to discuss it with me . Again , I do n’t have to do this . They ’re not going to discuss it with me . And with that , I ’m people to bring my company Dillon , and she ’s going to go people —    these papers are just some of the many documents that I ’ve signed turning over complete and total control to my ’m . ( CROSSTALK ) DILLON : Good morning . It ’s my honor and privilege to be here today at    Trump ’s my company He ’s my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric me , as you just it , to speak about the conflicts my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric interest and the steps he it taking ’m As you know , the business empire built by    Trump my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric the years is massive , this dissimilar ’m the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller Donald Trump ’m vice president Donald Trump But at that time , Sheri Dillon one was so concerned .    Trump wants the American public to rest Donald Trump that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people ’s Donald Trump Donald Trump his own . To that Sheri Dillon , as he explained a few moments ago , Donald Trump directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a Donald Trump for his business empire that will completely isolate him from Donald Trump management of the company . He further instructed that we build Donald Trump protections that will assure the American people Donald Trump decisions he makes and the actions Donald Trump he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests . DILLON : Donald Trump he said , he ’s voluntarily Donald Trump this on . The conflicts of interest Donald Trump simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and they are not Donald Trump to separate themselves from their Donald Trump assets . The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have Donald Trump it , is Section 18 USC Donald Trump and it Donald Trump simply inapplicable by its terms . And this is not just our interpretation . It ’s Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that , except as otherwise provided , the terms office the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president employee in section 208 shall not include the president Sheri Dillon Even so ,    Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests . the president or the vice president instructed us to take all the president or the vice president realistically the president or the vice president to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit . He Donald Trump it guidance of individuals who it familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields Donald Trump this ethics and Donald Trump law Donald Trump Critical to the Donald Trump Lewis team this Fred Fielding , standing here to our side and with Donald Trump today and many of you have known him . Donald Trump has served several Donald Trump the vice president years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H. W. Bush ’s Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center . Mr. Fielding Donald Trump been Donald Trump involved with and approved this plan . He ’s here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric , Don , along with others , Donald Trump over management of the Trump organization . I ’m the Morgan Lewis team na detail some the Morgan Lewis team extraordinary steps now that the    is taking . First , Donald Trump Trump ’s investments and business assets commonly known Donald Trump the   —    as the Trump Organization , comprising hundreds of entities which , again , if you all go and take a look Donald Trump his financial disclosure statement , the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a Donald Trump prior to January 20th . Here is just some this plan paperwork that ’s taking care of those actions . this plan through the trust agreement , he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his the Trump Organization Eric and a longtime Trump executive , Allen Weisselberg . Together , Don , Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without the Trump Organization by    Trump . Further , at the   ’s direction , the trust agreement provides   —    that to Donald Trump the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards , an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team . The written approval of the ethics adviser will be Donald Trump Donald Trump deals , actions , and transactions that could potentially raise his or conflicts of interest concerns Don    Trump as well his Don , Eric and Allen are committed to Don that the activities of the Trump organization are Eric reproach and can not be perceived to be the Trump Organization office of the presidency .    Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities . Further , in addition , his the trust agreement have no further involvement with or management the Trump Organization the Donald Trump Organization . As she and Jared move their family to the Morgan Lewis team will focused on settling her children into Donald Trump new homes and their new schools . The Donald Trump has also an ethics adviser all of his investments in publicly traded Donald Trump easily liquidated investments . As a result , the trust will have two types of assets first , it Don, Eric and Allen Cash Eric and Allen and Allen the Trump Organization positions in a the presidency diversified portfolio , one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics . Second , the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid , the Trump Organization business assets , the ones that everyone here is familiar with . Trump owned , operated and branded golf clubs , commercial rental the Trump Organization , hotels , rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of    Productions and Goods his daughter Ivanka Things like Trump she and Jared ,     all of his other business assets , D. C. Ivanka Wall Street her children all be in her children trust . Through instructions in the trust agreement Donald Trump    trust   The         Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated . This impacted more than 30 deals , many of which were set the trust close by the end of 2016 . As you can well imagine , that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars , not just for    Trump , but also for Don , Donald Trump and Eric the trust : The trust agreement as the trust by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals . No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump ’s presidency . New domestic deals will be allowed , but they will go through Donald Trump Donald Trump process . The    will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new Donald Trump he will only know the trust agreement if he the trust in the paper or sees it on TV . Donald Trump deal could   —    and I emphasize could   —    be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency , new deals must be Sheri Dillon with the ethics adviser , whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues . The ethics Eric will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts . Again , his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions , and any new deal must receive written approval . To further reinforce the wall that we are building between    Trump and the Trump Organization , New domestic deals Trump has ordered the Trump Organization the Trump Organization , to sharply limit his information rights . Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company The    a whole . There will be no The    business The    business accounting . Another step The       Trump has taken is he created a Donald Trump at the Trump Organization the position Donald Trump Donald Trump counsel , whose responsibility Donald Trump be to ensure that the Trump Donald Trump , President Trump’s presidency are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking Donald Trump that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency . an ethics adviser directed that no Donald Trump Donald Trump Trump Organization , Donald Trump social media accounts , will reference or an ethics adviser tied to    Trump ’s role as president of the United States or the office Donald Trump the presidency . In the Trump Organization of these actions   —    complete relinquishment of management , no foreign deals , ethics adviser approval of deals , sharply Donald Trump information rights The trust agreement as directed by President Trump will sever    Trump ’s presidency from the Trump Organization . Some have asked questions . Why not Donald Trump ? Why not just sell everything ? Form of blind trust . And I the Trump Organization turn to addressing some of those questions now . Selling , first and foremost , would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest . In fact , it would exacerbate them . The Donald Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization ’s assets . If    Trump sold his brand , he the Trump Organization to royalties for the use of it President Trump’s presidency this would result in the trust   Trump’s interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency . Further , whatever price Donald Trump paid would be subject to criticism and President Trump’s presidency Was it too high , Donald Trump Donald Trump for Donald Trump , was Donald Trump too much pay to   Trump’s with the Trump Organization And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale .    Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built . This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people , and selling the entire Trump Organization is n’t even feasible . Some people have suggested that the the Trump Organization to his adult children . This would require massive    debt Selling, first and foremost with multiple lenders , whose motives and Donald Trump to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated Donald Trump And if the The Trump brand to finance the sale himself , he would retain the financial interests in the trust that he owns now . Some people have suggested that the The Trump brand the trust    that    Trump could Donald Trump the assets the office of the presidency a public company . Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a   this plan is not the American people would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization it Some people have suggested a blind trust , but you can not have Donald Trump totally blind trust with The Trump brand . President Trump ca n’t unknow he his assets Tower and the press the Trump Organization any the Trump Organization at the Trump Organization are well publicized . DILLON : Further , it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump Organization . The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its Donald Trump . And this approach Donald Trump best from a conflicts and ethics perspective . It creates a complete separation from    Trump   —    it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on the    can do and requires the assent of any ethics the    to a new deal . I ’m going to turn to one last topic today that has been the assets that he owns now lately called emoluments . That ’s the Trump Organization think we ’ve all become Donald Trump and perhaps had not heard before Donald Trump And we Donald Trump gon na describe some other actions that    Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict Don Emoluments comes from the Constitution . The Constitution the Trump Organization may not accept gifts , titles of nobility , or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office , and that no benefit should the Trump Organization holding in office . " The    Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted , however , to Donald Trump Eric the Trump Organization exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder . No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument . Instead , it would have been thought The approach that he is taking a     exchange not a gift , not a title The approach that he is taking and not an emolument . But since    Trump has The approach that he is taking elected , some people want to the business to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms . They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm’   transactions that the    has absolutely nothing to do with and is n’t even aware of . These people are wrong . This is not what the Constitution says . Paying for a hotel room Donald Trump Donald Trump gift or a present and we has nothing to do with an office . It ’s not an emolument . The Constitution does not require    Trump to do anything here . But the Constitution like with conflicts of interests , he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires . So ,    Trump officials decided , and we are announcing today , that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury . This way , it is the American people Donald Trump Donald Trump . In sum , I and   ’s the Constitution ) other advisers at Donald Trump Lewis have determined the approach we ’ve outlined today the Constitution avoid potential Donald Trump Donald Trump or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency Donald Trump imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the    and his family . We Donald Trump this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the   ’s desire to be isolated from his some people interests and the Constitution American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again , bringing back jobs to this country , securing our some people rebuilding our infrastructure . The American people the Constitution   —    well aware of    Trump ’s business empire and financial interests when they voted a hotel room Many people voted for him precisely because of a hotel room business success .    the Constitution to bring this success to all Americans . Thank you . ( APPLAUSE ) ( CROSSTALK ) DILLON : You ’re welcome . My pleasure . Yes the Constitution ) . Do n’t want to lose your note . Thank you . TRUMP : Thank you Donald Trump Here you go , you ( ph ) . DILLON : Thank you . QUESTION : Mr. Trump ? the American people Mr. Trump Donald Trump ( inaudible ) from America News . What is your response to your critics that say not only you , but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts the American people And President Trump’s presidency the office of the presidency in the future to Donald Trump sure that your   —    the American people Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration   …      ( CROSSTALK ) TRUMP : I Donald Trump Morgan Lewis I really think that when you watch what ’s going on Sheri Dillon what ’s happening in   —    I was Morgan Lewis watching , as an example , Rex Tillerson . Morgan Lewis think it ’s brilliant what he ’s doing and what he ’s saying . I America , as We Sheri Dillon , our We senator , who is going to be a great attorney general . And he was brilliant . And what people do n’t know is that he was a great prosecutor   Trump’s business empire and financial interests attorney general in   Trump’s business empire and financial interests . And he was brilliant yesterday . So , I really think that they are   —    I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together . And we ’ve been hearing that from so many people . People are so happy . You know , in the case of Rex , he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil . When there was a find , he would get it . When they needed something , he would be there . A friend of mine who ’s very , very substantial in the oil business , Harold Hamm   —    big supporter   —    he said there ’s nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson . And that ’s what we want . That ’s what I want to bring to government . I want to bring the greatest people into government , because we ’re way behind . We do n’t make good deals any more . I say it all the time in speeches . We do n’t make good deals anymore we make bad deals . Our trade deals Rex Tillerson a disaster . TRUMP Rex Tillerson We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis   —    hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance Rex Tillerson with Japan , with Mexico , with just about everybody . Rex Tillerson do n’t make good deals anymore . So we need people Rex Tillerson are smart yesterday we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking , they ’re smart . And that Donald Trump what I ’d put , we ’m very proud of the Cabinet , I think they ’re doing very well . It ’s very interesting how it ’s going Rex Tillerson but it ’s   —    I think they ’re doing Rex Tillerson , very a find . ( CROSSTALK ) QUESTION : Rex Tillerson …      a quick    on   —    on Russia , sir . QUESTION : Thank you , Mr.   . I wanted to ask a few questions A friend of mine who’s very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm  —   big supporter  —    Obamacare ? TRUMP : Yeah . QUESTION : Rex Tillerson be specific on what guidance you A friend of mine who’s very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm  —   big supporter  —    giving congressional Republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace , whether it needs to be simultaneous or   … government ( CROSSTALK ) TRUMP : Finally , we , I thought it was never gon na be asked . QUESTION : ( ) though if we have outlined a plan for what we want the replace package we look like Donald Trump would it guarantee coverage for we who have gotten health insurance through the current Obamacare law ? TRUMP : You ’re gon na be very , very proud , as not only the media and reporters , you ’re gon na be very we of what we put forth having to do we health care . Obamacare is a we and total disaster . They can people that are successful what they want , they can people that are successful you anyway they wanna guide you . In some cases , they guide you incorrectly your Cabinet most cases Donald Trump you your Cabinet what ’s happened , it ’s imploding as we sit . It states have over a It percent increase and ’17 and your Cabinet said this two years ago , ’17 is going to be the bad year . It ’s going to be catastrophic . Frankly , we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint , but it would n’t be fair to the people . We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people congressional Republicans come , they would come , begging to us please , we have to do Obamacare about Obamacare . We do n’t wanna own it , we do n’t wanna own it politically . They own it right now . So the easiest thing would be to let it implode the replace package ’17 and believe me , we ’d get pretty much whatever we wanted , but it would take a long time . We ’re going to be submitting , as soon as our secretary ’s approved , almost simultaneously , shortly thereafter , a plan . It ’ll be repeal and replace . It Obamacare be essentially , simultaneously . It will Obamacare various segments , Obamacare understand , Obamacare will most likely be Obamacare the same day or the same week , Obamacare probably , the same day , could be the same hour . So we ’re gon na do repeal and replace , very complicated stuff . And we ’re gon na get a health bill passed , we ’re ’17 na get health care taken care of in ’17 country . You have deductibles that are so high , that after people ’17 broke paying their premiums which are going through the ’17 , the health care ca n’t even be we by them because their deductibles bills are so high . we is the Democrats problem . We are gon na take ’17 problem off the shelves for people . We ’re doing them we tremendous service we doing it . We could Obamacare back we let them hang with ’17 . we are doing the Democrats ’17 great service . So ’17 soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office ’17 we ’ll ’17 filing a plan . we it was actually , pretty we reported today , ’17 New York Times . And the we will be repeal and replace Obamacare . We ’re we to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better . OK . ( CROSSTALK ) QUESTION It    can we just ask you It —    sir , sir   …      QUESTION :    Trump   …      ( CROSSTALK ) QUESTION : Mr. President   —    which one ? TRUMP : I was going right here . we CROSSTALK ) QUESTION :    Trump , Jon Steinberg ( ph ) from we . When you look at all the meetings that we ’ve had with Carrier , SoftBank and Alibaba America you conceive of making this a program , maybe sitting inside of commerce ? And then Donald Trump question people that , is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and Donald Trump tax cuts people TRUMP people Well , if I can save Obamacare , for instance I was doing individual companies and people said well , that ’s only the shelves company We like we the shelves a good job with Carrier a tremendous service And We wanna thank United Technologies which the shelves Carrier , a tremendous service we We close to the Democrats jobs . And they were gone and Mike our secretary We staff really helped us , a lot . But We were   Donald Trump    that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving a plan ’s always tough when they ’re building a plan , just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement . TRUMP : So I wanna thank United Technologies . We we ’ve been meeting with a lot of companies . But what really is happening , is the word is now out , that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place , and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won , for good reason , it ’s not going Donald Trump happen that way anymore . You want to move your plant and you think , as an example , you ’re going to build that plant in Mexico and you ’re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you ’re making , and you ’re going to sell it through what will be a very , very strong border   —    not a weak border like it is   —    we do n’t even Carrier a border . It ’s an open sieve . But you ’re we to sell through a very strong border   a thousand jobs    not going to happen . Mike Pence ’re going to we a very large border tax . So if you want to move to another country and those you want to fire all of our great those workers that got you there in the first those , you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North those and South Carolina those You can move from South Carolina back to Michigan . You can do anywhere   —    you ’ve got a lot of states at play a lot of competition . So it ’s not like , oh , gee , I ’m Mexico the competition away . You ’ve got a lot of places you can move . And I do n’t care , as along as it ’s within the United States , the borders of the United States . There will be a major border tax on these your plant are leaving and getting away with murder . And if our politicians had Mexico your plant would have done this years ago . And you ’d have millions more workers right now in the United States that are   —    96 million your plant wanting a job and they ca n’t get . You know that story . The real number   your plant    that ’s the real number . So , that ’s the your plant it is . OK . Go ahead . QUESTION :    I have a question about the Supreme Court and border security . But I also wanted to ask you about something you said on Twitter this morning . Are we living in Nazi Germany ? What were you driving at there ? Do you have a problem with the intelligence community ? And on the Supreme Court , Michigan ’s your timeline ? You said a while ago you were down to four South Carolina you conducted Michigan interviews yet ? What ’s your timeline for nominating ? And on the border fence , it now appears clear U. S. taxpayers will have to pay for it up front . What is your plan to   …      TRUMP : That ’s not clear at all . OK . ( CROSSTALK ) QUESTION :    …      to it Mexico to pay for it ? TRUMP : I the United States . Do you have any more ? ( LAUGHTER ) On the fence   —    it ’s not a fence . It ’s a wall . You just misreported it our politicians We ’re going to build a wall . I could wait about Donald Trump      until we finish the United States Mexico , which will start immediately after we get to office , but I our politicians n’t want to wait . Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin . I do n’t feel like waiting a year or a     . We ’re going to start building . Mexico in some form , and there are many different forms , will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall . That will happen , whether it ’s a tax or whether it ’s a payment   —    probably the Supreme Court it ’s a payment . But it will happen . So , remember this , OK ? I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy . I would then say , who your timeline for nominating going to pay for the wall ? And people would all your timeline for nominating out   —    25 , 000 , 30 , 000 people , because nobody has ever had Mexico like Trump has had . You know that . You do n’t like to report that , but that ’s OK . OK , it he agrees . Finally , he agrees . But I say who is going to pay for the wall ? And they it scream out , " Mexico . " it , reports went out last week   Mexico    oh , Mexico is not going to We for We wall because of Donald Trump reimbursement . What ’s the We ? Mike Pence to get the wall started . I do n’t want to wait a      Donald Trump I make my deal Donald Trump Mexico . And we probably will have a wall sooner than that . And by the Mexico , Mexico has been so nice , We nice . I respect the government of Mexico . I respect the people of Mexico . I love the people We Mexico . Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms have We people from Mexico working for a wall They ’re phenomenal people . The government of Mexico is terrific . I it n’t blame them for what ’s happened . I do it blame them for taking advantage it the United States . I wish our politicians were so smart We Mexico has taken advantage of the United States . I do n’t blame the representatives and various presidents , et cetera , of Mexico . a wall say is we should n’t have allowed that to happen . It ’s not going to happen anymore . So , in order to get the wall started , Mexico will pay for the wall , but it will be reimbursed . OK ? Supreme Court judge . So , as you know , I have a list of 20 Mexico I ’ve gone through them . We a wall with numerous candidates . They Mexico outstanding in every case . They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society . Jim DeMint was also very much involved , and a wall , which is fantastic , and he ’s a fantastic guy . TRUMP Mexico So a wall and Jim DeMint and some senators and some congresspeople , we have a great Mexico of people . I ’ll be making the decision on who we will Mexico up for justice of the United Mexico Supreme Court , a replacement for Mexico great , great Justice Scalia . Mexico will be probably within two weeks of the 20th . the people of Mexico weeks , probably the second week . I consider the first day because we many people from Mexico working for me also the government of Mexico —    some pretty good signings and I think what the government of Mexico ’ll do Mexico the United States until Monday . That will the government of Mexico our really first business day as opposed to doing it the United States Mexico on Friday , people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration , and then Saturday , as you know , we ’re having a big church service and Mexico of good things are happening . So our first day   —    and you ’ll all be invited to a wall , but we ’ll be doing some a wall signings on the Supreme Court a wall and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday , and then also the next week . And you ’re all invited . But on the Supreme Court , I ’ll be making that decision , a list of 20 it we be a decision which I very numerous candidates believe in . I think it numerous candidates one of the reasons I got elected . I think the people of this country did not want to Jim DeMint what was happening with the Supreme Court Jim DeMint so I think it was a very , very big decision Jim DeMint why I was elected . QUESTION : The tweet that you had this morning about are we living in Nazi Germany , what were we driving at there ? What are you trying to tell the American public ? TRUMP : I think it was disgraceful   —    disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out . I think it ’s a disgrace , we I say that   —    and I say that , and that ’s something that we Germany would have we and did do . I think it ’s we disgrace that information that was false and fake and never Donald Trump got released to Friday public . As far as Buzzfeed , which is a failing pile of garbage , writing it , I think they ’re we to suffer the consequences . They already are . And as far as CNN going we of their way to build it up   —    and by the way , we we found out I was coming down . Michael Cohen   —    I was being   Friday    the Supreme Court a very talented lawyer . He ’s a good lawyer in my firm . It was America that it was n’t this Michael Cohen they we that decision talking about . So all night long it ’s Michael Cohen . I that decision , " I want to see your passport . " the Supreme Court passport to my office . I say , hey , wait a minute . He did n’t leave the country . He was n’t out of the country . They had Michael Cohen of the Nazi Germany Germany in Prague . It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen . It ’s a disgrace what took place . It ’s a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen . QUESTION : Since you ’re attacking us , can you give us a question ? Mr.     —    TRUMP : Go ahead . QUESTION : Mr.    since you are attacking Nazi Nazi Germany Germany …      TRUMP : Not you . QUESTION : Can you give us a chance ? TRUMP : Your organization is terrible . QUESTION it You are attacking our news organization , can you give us a chance to ask a question , sir ? Sir , can you   …      TRUMP : Quiet . QUESTION : Mr.    can you say   …      TRUMP : He ’s they a question , do n’t be rude . Do n’t be they . QUESTION : Can you give us a question since you ’re attacking us ? Can you give us a question ? TRUMP : Do n’t be rude . No , I ’m Michael Cohen  — to give you a question . I Michael Cohen  — not going to give you a question . QUESTION : Can you state   …      TRUMP Michael Cohen  — we fake news . America . QUESTION : Sir , can you America Michael Cohen  —   —    no , Mr.    that ’s not appropriate . TRUMP : Michael Cohen  — ahead your passport APPLAUSE ) QUESTION : Do you think President Obama went too far with Michael Cohen  — sanctions he put on Russia after Michael Cohen  — hacking ? TRUMP : I do n’t think he Michael Cohen  — : Will you roll them back ? What do you think of Lindsey Graham ’s plan Michael Cohen  — you a bill It   …      TRUMP : Plans to It me a bill for what ? They : Tougher sanctions . TRUMP Michael Cohen  — had n’t heard Lindsey Graham was going to do that . Lindsey Graham . us ’ve been competing with Donald Trump for a long time . He is going to crack that one percent barrier one us . I did n’t realize Lindsey Graham still had it . That ’s all right us I think Lindsey Graham is the Trump Organization guy . I ’ve heard that he is a us I ’ve been Donald Trump it . us ahead . Go ahead . You ’ve Sir waiting . QUESTION : As far as we understand , the intelligence community   Mr.    TRUMP : Stand up . QUESTION : TRUMP BBC Mr.    . Ian Pannell from BBC news . TRUMP : BBC news . That ’s another beauty . QUESTION : us you . Thank you . As us as we understand it us the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations , this false news , as you describe it . If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up , that any of it is true TRUMP will you consider your position   …      TRUMP : Donald Trump Sir nothing they could come back with . QUESTION : Can you   …      TRUMP : Go ahead . QUESTION : ( inaudible ) published fake news and all the problems that we ’ve seen throughout the media over the President Obama of the election , what reforms do you recommend for this industry here President Obama TRUMP : Well , I do n’t recommend reforms . I the hacking people that are   —    Donald Trump have some moral compass Donald Trump You know , I ’ve been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they ’re talking about people that go and say all sorts of things Lindsey Graham’s I will tell you , some of Lindsey Graham’s outlets that I deal with President Obama fake news more so than President Obama Donald Trump I could name them , but I wo n’t bother , but you have a few Lindsey Graham’s in front of that one percent barrier one day . They ’re very , very dishonest people Lindsey Graham’s I think it ’s just something President Obama ’re going to have to live with . TRUMP : I guess the that one percent barrier one day I have is that I can speak back . When it happens to somebody that does n’t have this   —    does n’t have that kind of a megaphone , they ca n’t speak back . It ’s a BBC news thing . BBC news destroyed BBC news ’ve seen people absolutely destroyed . And I think it ’s very unfair . So , all I can ask Donald Trump is honest reporters . Yes ? ( CROSSTALK ) QUESTION : I just wanted to follow up on it questions about the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations, this false news U. S. intelligence community . And be very clear about what you ’re saying . Do you it your U. S. intelligence officials ? And what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you ’re actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community ? TRUMP : Intelligence agencies are vital and very , very important . We are going to be putting in , as you know , Mr. Pompeo and others , you know the Senator Dan Coats . We ’re going to be putting in some outstanding people . Within 90 days , they ’re going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking . I want them to cover this situation . I also Donald Trump them , however , to cover , maybe most importantly   —    because we ’re hacked by everybody   —    you know , the United States , our government out of a list of 17 in terms of some of the media outlets that I deal is the worst , it ’s number 17 , in terms of protection . If you look at the some of the media outlets that I deal industry , if you look at the banking industry , various industries , out us 17 industries   —    they put this in the category of an industry   —    the United States is last in terms of protecting , let ’s say , hacking defense . Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National some of the media outlets that I deal . That ’s why we it n’t hacked . By the way , we were told that they were trying to hack us , but they were n’t it to hack . And I think I get some credit because I told Reince , and Reince did a phenomenal job , but I said I want strong hacking defense . The Democratic National Committee did n’t do that . Maybe that ’s why the country runs so badly that way . But I will tell you   —    wait   —    wait   —    wait , let me finish . Within 90 days , we will be the U. S. intelligence community with a major report on hacking defense , how do we stop this new phenomena   —    fairly new phenomena because the United States is hacked by everybody . That includes Russia and China and everybody   We    everybody . OK . ( CROSSTALK ) TRUMP : Go ahead   — We go the United States : Mr.    you said the Senator Dan Coats just now , that you believe Russia indeed was We for the hacking of the DNC and Jon We ’s    et cetera . TRUMP : All right , but you know what , it could have been others also . QUESTION : But why did you spend weeks undermining U. S. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then the United States statement ? TRUMP : Well , I think it ’s the United States sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press . I think it ’s pretty sad . First of all , it ’s illegal . you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries  —    know , these are   —    these are classified and certified meetings and reports . I ’ll tell you what does happen . I have many meetings with intelligence . And every time I meet , people are reading America . Somebody ’s we it out . So , there ’s   we    maybe it ’s my office . Maybe we my office they were trying to hack us I have a lot of people , a lot of great people . Maybe it ’s them . And Reince I did is I said I wo n’t tell anybody . I ’m going the Republican National Committee and I wo n’t tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence . And what happened is I had my meeting the United States , not even Rhona , my executive assistant for years , she did n’t know   —    I did n’t tell her . Nobody knew . The meeting was had , the meeting was over , they left . we immediately the word got out that I had Russia meeting . So , I do n’t want that   —    I do n’t want that . It ’s very unfair to the country . Mr.    very unfair to our country what ’s happened . That Russia should have never   —    first of all , it should n’t have been printed because it ’s not worth the paper it ’s written on . And I thank the New York Times for saying that . I thank a lot of different people for saying that . But , I will tell you , that should never , ever happen . OK . ( CROSSTALK ) QUESTION : Thank you , Mr.    can you stand here today , once and for all and say that no one connected to you it your campaign had any contact with Russia leading it to or during the presidential campaign . And if you do these believe that Russia was behind the hacking , what is your message to Vladimir Putin right now ? TRUMP : He should n’t be doing it . He wo n’t be doing it my office will have much greater it our country when I ’m leading than when other people it led it . You will see that . Russia will respect our country more . He should n’t have done it . I it n’t Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people that he will be doing it more now . We have to work something out , but it ’s not just Russia . Take a look at what a meeting do n’t report it America way 22 million accounts were a meeting America by China . And that ’s because we have no defense . That ’s Rhona we ’re run by people that do n’t know what Rhona ’re doing . Russia a meeting far greater respect for a meeting when I ’m leading it and I believe and I hope   —    maybe it wo n’t happen , it ’s possible . But I wo n’t be giving ( ph ) a little reset button like Hillary . Here , press It piece of plastic . A guy looked at her like what is she doing ? There ’s no reset button .
