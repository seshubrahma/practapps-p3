Sunday on MSNBC ’s " AM Joy , "   Rep. Maxine Waters ( ) said the public was " getting weary " that Democrats have not done enough to begin the process of impeaching President Donald Trump .   Partial transcript as follows : REID : Congresswoman ,   on the subject of being more aggressive , you have openly talked about the fact that this president has put this president in a position where impeachment is on the table but your party , your party is very reluctant , The New York Times has an article out last week about how hesitant Democratic leadership , in particular , are to call for Donald Trump ’s impeachment . In closing , why do you suppose that is ? WATERS :   I do n’t know what the reticent is but I know this , that the American public is getting weary of all of these actions without enough being done by the elected officials who they elected to represent them . these actions I believe that this man has done enough for us to determine that we can connect the dots , that we can we the facts that will lead to impeachment . I believe there was collusion . I think we have we information about the meetings , the about the lying about those meetings to help us to we that something was going on . There was an interaction there . And certainly I believe it was collusion , but if they just collusion their work collusion do their job collusion they will collusion out it was collusion . And I believe this president should be impeached . I do n’t care what others say about ‘ it ’s too soon , we do we know , we think.’ we think that they ’re letting the American public down by not delving deeper into what is going on with Jared Kushner and this back channeling , about the lies and his failure Jared Kushner disclose he had Jared Kushner these meetings , the same thing with sessions , failure to disclose about the meetings these meetings more do we need ?
