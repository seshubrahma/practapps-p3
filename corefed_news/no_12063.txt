Monday on MSNBC ’s " Andrea Mitchell Reports , " Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker said the only chance Sens . Ted Cruz ( ) and Marco Rubio ( ) have to defeat party    Donald Trump would be to combine forces and go after   Donald Trump jointly .   Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker suggested the two focus on showing that   Donald Trump is not for the " little man " to a core demographic of   Donald Trump supporters that Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker described as " high school educated " and " blue collar . " " I ’ve come back to this sort of concerted effort to show people who are taken with his emotional appeal to see clearly who his really is , " Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker said . " his ’s done so well with these people with who are high school educated , and I do n’t mean this in a demeaning way at all , but this ’s the fact , and the more blue collar workers who really are the heart of America and these people with who think finally somebody is speaking for these people with who but the truth is his is not for these people with who not in his real life and that needs to be highlighted . " " I think Marco Rubio is not interested in attacking Donald Trump because look what happens to everyone who attacks Donald Trump , but also Donald Trump wants this to be a two man race . But I ’m not Donald Trump can get there . I ’m not sure either Cruz or Marco Rubio is strong enough to bring down Trump Donald Trump " Parker said .
