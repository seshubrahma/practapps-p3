Movie theaters around the country are screening a glamorous new movie about a     Indian      in the United States   —    but viewers are n’t told that a glamorous new movie about a     was funded by lobbyists to help import more foreign workers for the moviegoers’ own    jobs . [ The movie , " For Here Or To Go ? " offers a very flattering image of the almost 1 million        holding    jobs throughout the the United States The    movie follows the efforts by    contract workers to get green cards and dates . It features a The   movie number , but it sidelines the The   movie and worries of many    young Americans whose salaries and careers are being undercut by the flood of cheap    contract workers .   The movie ’s basic message is that foreigners are entitled to live in the United States if they want to foreigners so , regardless of American law or Americans’ wishes . " You can build your life where you choose to . The question is and always will be this : Where do you think you belong ? Where is home ? " says one supporting character to the lead character . " I have actively supported this movie realizing The movie as an The movie tool [ and ] many renowned venture capitalists , founders , entrepreneurs , academics have also been supporting it , " said The movie online statement from Tahmina Watson , an immigration lawyer serving Indian and Chinese customers in Seattle , Wash. " Some [ supporters’ ] names include Brad Feld , renowned [ venture capitalist ] [   booster ] Vivek    academic and think tank , the Instagram founder [ Mike Krieger ] and many many more , " she wrote March 31 Vivek    Investor " Brad Feld donated $ 25 , 000 to the movie !    …      my dear friend and [ immigration lawyer ] member Joel Paget who donated a huge sum to the movie , " the movie .   Vivek    2016 , presidential candidate Donald Trump promised to revamp the program so that it does n’t hurt Americans the program . " These are temporary foreign workers , imported from abroad , for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay , " said a March 2016 statement from the campaign . " I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant , widespread    abuse . " That promise was a winning argument for many university educated voters who were being pressured by peers and employers to pull the lever for Hillary Clinton .   However , many    companies favor the    program , so it remains largely unchanged since the   program took office . Immigration lawyers expect the administration to start issuing another 85 , 000    visas starting April . Multiple Democratic and GOP politicians hope to further expand the      program .   the   program SGOP Sen. Orrin Hatch said in a March 30    that " we ’ve had a process for bringing    workers from other countries to the United States to fill jobs for which there is a shortage of American labor    …      But the system is    . Our immigration laws cap the number of    worker visas —   also called    visas —   that employers may obtain each year at a number that is far below demand . " Also , both Hatch and North Carolina ’s GOP Thomas Tillis want to provide a path to citizenship to any foreigner who pays for a graduate degree at an American university . " Our laws also lack a straightforward path for companies to hire foreign students at American universities on a permanent basis after graduation    …      This makes no sense , " said Hatch . " We should have a policy that basically staples a green card on the back of their diploma , with the agreement that We will work and contribute to the We economy , " Tillis said   . But that " staple " policy would create an unlimited supply of Indian , Chinese , South Americans , European and African professionals eager to underbid salaries sought by young and    American professionals . In Washington , the new movie is being touted by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine and by the CATO Institute , which favors an easy flow of labor across national borders . It is also being supported by Facebook the new movie Mark Zuckerberg ’s    lobby , FWD . us , via its head , Todd Schulte . The the new movie is also being touted by Jose Andrews , an immigration proponent who hires cheap labor for his D. C. restaurants . It is " the movie that you The movie to watch   —   it is an amazing story of immigrants in America . " " We ’re trying to tell a new story here   …      and I ’m fully supportive of it , " said Ash Kalra , a new story    city councilor in San Jose , California , " This is really where the best and brightest of the Indian community have come to contribute . " Last September , the movie was shown to staffers in Congress , said Watson . September 2nd 2016 was a very special day .   It was the day that the movie For Here a very special day Go the movie the Rayburn House    one of the Buildings where Congressmen have their offices . Fresh off the heels of the announcement of International Entrepreneur Rules Congressmen this movie screening was so timely . The private screening was attended by staffers , lawyers , lobbyists and other influencers this movie screening especially grateful that the White House Assistant Director of Entrepreneurship Doug Rand attended in person . We were also delighted that Senator Tim Kaine ’s office was represented .   While Sen. We is now candidate for Vice President , he was one of the original    Senator Tim Kaine Startup Visa . A huge thank you goes Senator Tim Kaine my very own Congressman Adam Smith ( ) who    in holding the event .   The Congressman ’s office went above and beyond in helping with the event , for which we my very own Congressman Adam Smith ( ) who   in holding the event . We were also able to partner with Unshackled Ventures the event organization that recognizes the invaluable contributions of international entrepreneurs we has been at the forefront of the issue . And lastly , we would n’t have had refreshments without the generous support of FWD . us and it ’s president Todd Schulte we In addition , two of my colleagues Joel Paget , immigration lawyer we Seattle and Sonal Verma in Washington DC both gave incredible support and encouragement in holding the event .    …      Rishi and I had the privilege of attending a reception at the CATO institute where we had the distinct pleasure of meeting immigration policy extraordinaire Alex Nowrasteh ! The movie is opening at 29 theater screens , including four screens in the D. C. area , three in Texas and six screens in California . The annual inflow of roughly 110 , 000      takes jobs for    rates at U. S.   companies , universities , and   . That makes sense for the foreign workers because many hope to get the hugely valuable    prize of citizenship from the U. S. government after perhaps ten years of work . The citizenship bonus can also be duplicated for their parents , siblings , children ad grandchildren . The deal is also rational for U. S. employers because they The citizenship bonus    rates and also do n’t have to pay the citizenship bonus to the    workers . That U. S. employers for many U. S. companies because it means they can The citizenship bonus done for cheaper and because it also lowers the marketplace salaries U. S. U. S. professionals .     many U. S. companies hired by many    companies , displacing Americans who it jobs with Microsoft or Facebook , Caterpillar or    Goldman Sachs or McDonald ’s . At least 100 , 000    are also employed in universities , hospitals ,    and government research centers as professors , scientists , doctors , and therapists .   But critics   —    and much      —    say the    program is rife with corruption , including fake resumes , fraudulent visa applications ,     payments , workplace and hiring discrimination against Americans , as well as false claims by lobbyists and corporates that too few Americans want to work at companies such as Goldman Sachs or Facebook .   Additional    programs deliver   The inflow of    workers cuts salaries for young Americans who are in direct competition with     —    mostly software experts , medical researchers ,    , doctors , statisticians .   But it also reduces the salaries of other American professionals   —    designers , journalists , business school graduates and even     — Additional   programs by increasing the nation ’s supply of skilled , flexible    experts who can perform a variety of skilled jobs .   A 2016 report by the National Academies of Science showed that    immigration annually transfers roughly $ 500 billion from American employees over to investors and employers .
