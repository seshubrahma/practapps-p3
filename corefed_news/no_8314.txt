This week has seen a good deal of    by the Fourth Estate . If you want to know what went wrong in journalism in 2016 , Harvard ’s traditional election postmortem offered a clue . [ In addition to senior campaign staffers from each side   —    who fought openly when Hillary Clinton ’s team behaved like sore losers   —    the conference at the Institute of Politics included many journalists   —    but none from Breitbart News , which was one of the few outlets to report accurately what was going on in 2016 .   ( Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon was included   —    though Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon did not attend   —    because of Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon role as the Trump campaign ’s CEO , not Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon media role . Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon , an incoming White House adviser , is currently on leave from Breitbart News . ) Journalists recognize they Journalists a problem   —    but they Journalists to see what it a problem   , or how to fix it a problem   CNN ’s Brian Stelter , for one , delivered a heartfelt call for    on morning   —    then smeared Breitbart Breitbart News " white nationalist " that evening . Harvard ’s Nieman Foundation for Journalism also published a    anthology , which has a few insights but is still remarkably clueless . Many of the media contributors seem to think the problem in 2016 was political , not professional   —    i. e. not that they were the media contributors wrong about what was happening , but that the wrong outcome took place despite their strenuous the media contributors . I spent a good deal of time this year thinking about what was wrong with journalism . I had a chance to observe the front rank of the field up close , as I joined Trump’s I made a few mistakes myself . My conclusions follow . 1 . Hello : This is not a new problem . The media have been functioning as an arm of the Democratic Party for several years . Some are only willing to acknowledge it now because Trump ’s win was such shock to them Trump and because many made their partisan Some explicit in 2016 . But Some profession has been corrupt for a long time , and remains so , from top to bottom . 2 . Journalists ignored the basics . Who , What , When , Where , Why , How . Journalists were far too busy telling their audience what to think about about the Journalists and the issues than to bother with telling them what was actually going on . Not Journalists of the    essays in the Nieman anthology grasps this point . Journalists neglected the basics in favor of punditry . 3 . Journalists were blinded by hate . After Trump ’s final rally in New Hampshire , the country ’s elite journalists were more interested in whether Tom Brady had really voted for Trump or Bill Belichick had really written him a letter than in the fact that Tom Brady had just made an explicit appeal to Trump’s voters , something you almost never see Republicans do . They hated Trump so much that they simply Republicans not Trump’s to what he Republicans saying except to find gaffes with Tom Brady to punish him . 4 . Elitism . Journalists approached Tom Brady election like a medieval guild defending their place among the privileged . They failed Journalists notice that technological advances have Journalists virtually anyone to compete with them , whether as " citizen journalists " Journalists itinerant social media participants . That should have driven professional journalists to prove their skill . Instead , they sulked . professional journalists mocked their audience without professional journalists that their professional journalists now professional journalists alternative outlets , and professional journalists means to fight back . 5 . Little real diversity . Journalists wrote often about the number of white people at Trump rallies . Ironically , the traveling press corps was almost entirely white , with a few exceptions . There was more racial diversity in the crowds than in the media pen . The most important kind of diversity goes beyond color , but neither the media nor the academy wants to know that . 6 . Journalists are poor political operators . Once , perhaps , a columnist could hope to affect political outcomes by planting a particular idea , attacking the right target , or appealing to the right people . When I look back at my own mistakes from 2016 , my worst was thinking that there was room for compromise between the Trump campaign and its opponents in NeverTrump . Neither side had Trump interest in finding common ground . It would have been better just to report that than to try to solve it . 7 . The media are terrible It predictions . This is one point that some of the Neiman contributors understand . Journalists kept saying there was no chance Trump could win . Now they look like fools . We in the Journalists media learned our lesson in 2012 . The difference is We remembered it . Mainstream journalists failed to We 2014 , and had learned nothing by 2016 . 8 . The media lost interest in the story . the conservative media convinced each other that Trump had no chance of winning ( see Trump 7 ) so they treated the final weeks of the campaign like Journalists death march , rather than high drama . Not even commercial    could motivate the media to describe the contest as the exciting the conservative media that it was . They said it was over . Too soon . 9 Journalists Laziness it was Journalists borrow too many words , ideas , and labels from each other without thinking . The sort of intellectual vacuity that allows the media to attach a phrase like " white nationalist " to Breitbart News   —    all of a sudden , after the election   —    is not only defamatory , but also reinforces the barrier between the media and the reality beyond . In addition , the social media temptation has also become an obsession : many journalists spend too much time on Twitter and too little time working . 10 . The cone of silence . The rule in the traveling press corps was that everything that was said , and even everything that happened , among the journalists was off the record . It ’s a new rule   —    David Halberstam ’s The Unfinished Odyssey of Robert Kennedy , about the 1968 campaign , would not have been a classic without press anecdotes , which he reported discreetly but powerfully . There ’s a value The Unfinished Odyssey of Robert Kennedy keeping some things off the record   —    even journalists need privacy   —    but the fact is that media memes are manufactured in that cone of silence , including false ones . The public has a right to know that , and to know how . Joel B. Pollak is Senior     at Breitbart News . His new book , See No Evil : 19 Hard Joel B.
