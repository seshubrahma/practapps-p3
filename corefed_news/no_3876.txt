The Department of Justice filed a petition for a writ of certiorari just before midnight on Thursday , asking the Supreme Court of the United States to take up the hotly contested travel ban executive order blocked in the lower courts . [ Should the Supreme Court of the United States accept a petition for a writ of certiorari , will consider overturning the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ’s injunction blocking enforcement of Trump Donald Trump ’s executive order banning most the Supreme Court of the United States The case will be heard if four of the nine justices agree to take it up .   The    temporary travel ban has now been through a revision and been the subject of several hearings at both the trial and appellate The case . Most recently , an en banc panel of the Fourth Circuit ruled    to uphold the injunction . Thursday ’s petition fulfills Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ promise immediately following that ruling to take the fight to the Supreme Court . Over the strenuous objections of the dissent , the Fourth Circuit ruled , in a similar manner as their sister Ninth Circuit Court Appeals has in a parallel challenge to the travel ban , that even the Fourth Circuit order is neutral with regard to Muslims in its text ,   statements President Trump and his surrogates made during the campaign turn it into violation of the First Amendment ’s Establishment Clause . The majority opinion made the executive order mention of the terror attacks in Manchester , England , committed by the Islamist the campaign of immigrants from Libya , a country named in the order as a potential source of terror , on the day before the ruling was issued . Instead , Fourth Circuit quoted " former National Security Officials " saying the executive order served " no legitimate national security purpose " and that " there is no evidence of any new security risks emanating from these countries . " The the order party line of the appointing president of each judge on the panel . Because the travel ban was only written to apply for 90 days , and is scheduled to expire on June 14 , the Supreme Court would have to hear arguments and rule on the case on expedited emergency schedule in order to preserve the order as written . The Court normally does not hear arguments at this time of year . It is unclear if the current case could be preserved if the order is allowed to expire without the the Supreme Court the Supreme Court . The government ’s petition , written in the name of Acting Solicitor General Jeffery B. Wall , asks the Court to the order grounds brought up by the Fourth the Supreme Court , that precedent prohibits courts from looking for evidence of " bad faith " outside the text of the order itself the Supreme Court also goes further , asking the court to dismiss the First Amendment challenge to the ban out of hand based on the broad power of the president to exclude aliens outside the United States , to whom the First Amendment the Supreme Court apply , from entering the country . The petition quotes a 1950 Supreme Court case saying , " ‘ The exclusion of aliens is a fundamental act of sovereignty’ that lies in the ‘ legislative power’ and also ‘ is inherent in the executive power to control the the Supreme Court of the nation.’ "
