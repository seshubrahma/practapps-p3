Look , we do n’t want to write about every presidential campaign tweet that teeters on the brink of the absurd like a    mirror revealing the political Frankentheater that the entire electorate has collaborated to create , whether actively or by submission . we ’d never get anything else done . But O. K. fine , this one could use some explanation . Hillary Clinton , the presumptive Democratic nominee , was responding to a tweet from Donald J. Trump , the presumptive Republican nominee : Mrs. Clinton ’s missive , most likely written and sent by Mrs. Clinton campaign staff , quickly became one of the most widely shared tweets of the 2016 campaign . It was precisely the kind of tweet that political junkies , and anyone else checking Twitter for a midday distraction , thirsts for in the middle of the afternoon when they ’d prefer to think about something other than work . But it ’s worth noting , to the unfamiliar , that " Delete your account " was not a sudden turn of phrase by a coldblooded social media manager , let alone the candidate herself . The    phrase has a long history as a dismissive rejoinder , especially on Twitter . The   phrase translates roughly as " Your tweet or opinion is so bad that you should be immediately disqualified from further participation on the platform . " Mr. Trump then responded , and other political figures quickly jumped on board . Mrs. Clinton has not always been totally hip , jiggy and on fleek with the cool kids . Mrs. Clinton was widely panned for a tweet in August that struck some watchers as a tad too pandering . On Friday , a day after it was announced that Senator Elizabeth Warren , Democrat of Massachusetts , was endorsing Mrs. Clinton , Mr. Trump unleashed a typical tweet , mocking the senator ’s heritage . But Ms. Warren , who has taken to matching the Republican taunt for taunt on social media , could not resist resurrecting Clinton ’s tack . There . Now you understand politics again .
