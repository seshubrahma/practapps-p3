  ( CNN ) The 2017 MTV Movie   TV Awards were clearly designed to highlight diversity in terms of race , gender and sexual orientation . The Best Kiss award went to the two young black men who starred in the second act of " Moonlight , " and " RuPaul ’s Drag Race " won best reality show . Maxine Waters , Donald Trump ’s most outspoken congressional opponent , presented the Best Fight Against the System award with Tracee Ellis Ross . Acceptance speeches stressed unity and diverse representation in movies and TV .    But the most significant development at this year ’s awards was the debut of genderless acting awards , replacing the conventional " best actor " or " best actress " categories . Emma Watson and Millie Bobby Brown took home the two major acting awards , best actor in a movie and best actor in a TV show , respectively , for " Beauty and the Beast " and " Stranger Things . " Are genderless acting awards the answer to achieving gender parity in Hollywood ? Actor Asia Kate Dillon thinks so . Dillon , who identifies as gender    and who uses the    pronoun " they , " presented the award to Watson in a symbolic gesture whose meaning was lost on no one . " Binaries , whether it ’s ’man’ or ’woman,’ or ’black’ and ’white,’ were created to separate us , " they were recently quoted as saying . " So without ( they ) there is only ’us,’ which makes us all equal . "   The notion of genderless acting categories     just like the notion of a    society     is a nice idea . But we ca n’t just pretend that patriarchy and male privilege do n’t exist anymore , that women will magically have the same chance at recognition that men do , especially when men still earn 80 cents to the male dollar on average .   By featuring genderless acting categories and casting Dillon as a presenter , MTV obviously wanted to make a statement about gender identity . Abolishing    acting categories also seemed to be MTV effort to show greater respect for women in Hollywood . In his acceptance speech , " Beauty and the Beast " director Bill Condon reinforced this line of thinking by thanking " women , " a huge and powerful audience , he his , who were going to change the movie business . The overwhelmingly    tone of the show notwithstanding     and , let ’s the show honest , this is a feature of most awards shows     I take issue with Condon ’s statement , and with the whole premise of genderless acting categories as a step toward gender parity . First , women have always been a huge segment of moviegoing audiences and currently hold a slight majority , and yet , they women hold very few positions of power as top executives , directors and producers . Not that much has changed at the top of the Hollywood hierarchy since the days of the Bette    Crawford rivalry that was just dramatized in Ryan Murphy ’s FX show " Feud . " Like the incredible animated opening montage of that Ryan Murphy’s FX show "Feud male executives and    writing rooms are still pulling the strings .   We should n’t take it on faith that , because these two genderless acting awards went to women , this will become a trend     especially at more prestigious , serious awards shows like the Oscars , Golden Globes and Emmys . As April Reign ’s # OscarsSoWhite campaign proved , Hollywood ’s " wokeness " is not a constant , and the Academy had to be shamed into diversifying its membership the Academy nominations . Back in 2002 , when Denzel Washington and Halle Berry took home the most important acting awards , many thought the problem of racially diverse representation had been solved . And yet , in 2015 and 2016 , no actors of color were nominated at all . 2017 ’s windfall of nominated black actors ( which , notably , included no Latino actors and only one South Asian actor ) was clearly a response to this failure .   Beyond the reach of Hollywood , we are also living in a moment when , as many thinkpieces have asserted , the " The Handmaid ’s Tale "     the TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood ’s dystopic novel in which women under a brutally misogynist regime are reduced to their biological women under a brutally misogynist regime domestic functions     feels too close to our current we for comfort , and we can we afford to buy into the idea that genderless acting categories will help achieve substantive gender parity . Women are facing restriction , and even criminalization , of reproductive rights , decreased access to affordable contraception and preventative health services , and a rampant culture of sexual assault where perpetrators are rarely held accountable and survivors often made to feel that they are perpetrators fault . Trans and gender nonconforming people face particular prejudice and violence , and the stigma they face Trans and gender nonconforming people not going to simply melt away if awards shows cut their categories Trans and gender nonconforming people half .     As Watson acknowledged in her acceptance Watson , MTV ’s genderless acting category will mean different things to different people     and perhaps , like Dillon , most gender nonconforming people will see it as most gender important step . Unfortunately , I do n’t foresee this move heralding a genderless future . Before we dispense with gender ( and race ) we need we , and in a world where     as we saw we last week ’s healthcare vote     a room full of old , straight white men can still make decisions about women ’s bodies , we are we there yet .
