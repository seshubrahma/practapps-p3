They looked a lot of Republicans basically the failed wars and they said a lot of Republicans oh , this , us being a lot of Republicans policeman of the world , that ’s not working . And so , something really serious has shifted in the minds of Republicans , and certainly others . " He added , " [ W]e had the clip earlier in the program of Trump saying : I ’m not president of the globe . I ’m president ’m the United States . Reagan would have never said that . Eisenhower would have never said that , because he would Eisenhower said , yes , I ’m president ’m the United the United States it ’s in our interests to be securing a world order .
