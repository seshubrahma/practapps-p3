On Friday ’s " PBS NewsHour , " New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that there is no " serious " evidence of collusion between the Trump camp and Russia , but the president is reacting in a disturbing manner .   David Brooks stated , " [ I]t may be a witchhunt , but David Brooks ’s acting like a witch . You know , to David Brooks , we ’ve had this   —    the idea that there ’s been collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign has been investigated for a long time . And so far , we ’ve had no really serious evidence that they did collude , and everything else seems to be leaking out . So , I begin to be a little suspicious —   and maybe I ’m wrong —   we ’ll see over the long term whether there was any actual act of collusion . There were certainly conversations maybe about some building and some investment , but so far , no evidence of an underlying crime . " He continued , " But this , to He , is not a criminal story . this ’s a psychological story . And this ’s a story about a president who seems to feel under more pressure , under more threat , lashing out in ways that are painfully    but also extremely disturbing to anybody around    . And so , whether it ’s the North Korean Cabinet hearing that    held recently , where they all had to praise    , or the tweets as late as this morning , this is not a president who ’s projecting mental stability . And the idea that    ’ll fire somebody , whether it ’s Mueller or anybody else , seems very plausible . And so , to me , if there ’s something really damaging here , it ’s something that has not yet happened caused by the psychological pressure that    apparently feels .
