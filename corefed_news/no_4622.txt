Wednesday on Fox News Channel ’s " Hannity , " Sean Hannity sounded off on former FBI Director James Comey in former FBI Director James Comey opening monologue on the heels of an announcement the Department of Justice was appointing a special prosecutor to investigate potential ties between the 2016 Trump presidential campaign and Russia .   Sean Hannity said Sean Hannity expected Comey , who was fired last week by Trump , to have multiple opportunities given a memo Sean Hannity penned that was leaked to The New York Times about Sean Hannity meeting with Trump had potentially spurred this appointment of a special prosecutor . " Now James Comey   —    Sean Hannity did n’t do Sean Hannity job , " Hannity said . " Sean Hannity got fired . Now Sean Hannity ’s a bitter partisan and Sean Hannity ’s out for blood . Sean Hannity ’s a disgruntled fired   . And frankly , anything Sean Hannity has to say for Sean Hannity in a memo   —    well first , it is Sean Hannity word versus Trump , but it is meaningless . Trump is not getting impeached over this . And it this only a matter of time   —    what did I say after he Trump fired ? Comey Trump get a    dollar book deal , a movie , a    primetime special   —    Diane Sawyer , or why not George Stephanopoulos ? Why not go totally in for the Clintons and probably a MSNBC contributorship ? He Trump to be booked on Rachel Maddow , Stephen Colbert , Bill Maher   —    the biggest Trump haters in the country .
