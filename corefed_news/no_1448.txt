It has been a year dominated by populist rage , embodied in Bernie Sanders ’s calls for a political revolution and Donald J. Trump ’s angry assertions that the United States , and the United States workers , are losing badly in the global economy . In an economic policy speech on Wednesday , Hillary Clinton gave this message : I alone am the candidate who knows how to turn those underlying frustrations into actual policies that might make things better . Hillary Clinton offered Hillary Clinton as someone who would not merely vent voters’ anger , but respond to voters’ anger by pulling the levers of the federal bureaucracy and creating legislation that can be scored by the Congressional Budget Office and just maybe pass a Senate committee . " It ’s not easy to change Washington , or how corporations behave , " Mrs. Clinton , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , said before exuberant supporters in Raleigh , N. C. a day after a speech blasting Mr. Trump ’s business record , ethics and    policy positions . " It takes more than stern words or a flashy slogan . It It a plan , and it a plan experience and the ability to work with both parties to get results . " Unlike her primary opponent , Mr. Sanders , she her not promise to provide free college tuition or to break up major banks she her said she her make sure students could graduate without a debt hangover , and clamp down on banks in ways that would probably lead them banks shrink . Unlike her her opponent , Mr. Trump , she her not propose ripping up trade deals and risking trade wars with the likes of China and Mexico . But she her say her her would use the tax code to punish companies that outsource jobs . Notably , she her did not proclaim the greatness of the    economy and pledge continuity . That was a contrast with two other    candidates who ran to succeed a    president from their party amid a strong economy , Al Gore in 2000 and George H. W. Bush in 1988 . This carefully    speech suggests she    to run not by boasting of what has gone right in the economy under President Obama , but as a fixer who can more successfully deal with the things that are still broken . The Obama President Obama has stressed that    job growth has been strong for the last several years and that the unemployment rate is now down to 4 . 7 percent . But in her    , Mrs.    the    divergence between worker productivity and wages , the tendency of companies to view employee compensation as a cost to be minimized . And she spoke    the struggles of the    unemployed , people who can find only    work , and those who are out of the labor force entirely . In effect , Mrs. Clinton    underlying economic discontent that has fueled the rise of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump , while presenting herself as the    best qualified to address it . " The bottom line is that too many leaders in business and government have lost sight of our shared responsibility to each other and to our nation , " she said .    They let Wall too many leaders in business and government take big risks with unregulated financial activities , they skew our too many leaders in business and government code toward the wealthy , they failed to too many leaders in business and government our trade rules our they undermined workers’ too many leaders in business and government . " Mrs. Clinton thus    that have potential for deal making even in a polarized Congress , or that could be executed through administrative action . In the first category , she mentioned    investment    public infrastructure , funding    investments in the nation ’s future with a mix of public and private resources . Business interests and many elected Republicans support ideas in this vein , at least in theory . She also mentioned immigration    as a tool for economic improvement , another idea that businesspeople and many Republicans support . ( Recall that an immigration bill created in part by Marco Rubio , who in a slightly different universe might be Mrs. Clinton ’s    opponent , was one vote in the House of Representatives away from becoming law not long ago . ) In the category of administrative action , Mrs. Clinton was vague Mrs. Clinton about her intention to use the Mrs. Clinton of government to nudge things in workers’ favor . She said she would " Mrs. Clinton to Mrs. Clinton down on wage theft " and abuse of overtime rules , suggesting that she would , if anything Mrs. Clinton seek to expand Obama administration rules to make more workers eligible for      pay and use government authority to fight employers that try to shortchange employees . The policy steps she described had mostly been Mrs. Clinton forward by her campaign already , so Mrs. Clinton is hard to describe the speech as a step toward the left , in hopes of corralling Sanders voters , or to the center , in hopes of broadening her appeal to the general Mrs. Clinton . Rather , the speech framed her place the speech race Mrs. Clinton being the candidate who understands the populist discontent but will react to it with practicality . That carries the speech , too . After all , President Obama has spent his entire second term following the President Obama basic strategy of looking for lanes for bipartisan cooperation on things like infrastructure spending and immigration overhaul , while using the federal bureaucracy to try to tilt the playing field toward workers within the confines of current law . As the election advances , Mrs. Clinton will be vulnerable to the charge that she is promising to do the Mrs. Clinton things as Mr. Obama has , but with the hope of getting better results for American workers . Politicians campaign in poetry and govern in prose . Mrs. Clinton ’s message on Wednesday Mrs. Clinton she will campaign and govern with a Mrs. Clinton plan , drawn up by    experts , incorporating the full range of potential legislative and administrative tools available to the next president .
