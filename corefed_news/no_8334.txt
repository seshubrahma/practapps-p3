" The truth is , we do n’t know what happened , " Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg said . " They have to release the immigration file . It ’s the only way we ’re really going to know , but based on what we know , it is possible that what she has done is far worse that what an undocumented immigrant does . Being undocumented in the U.
