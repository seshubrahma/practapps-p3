  Welcome to the Dangerous Faggot Tour ! I ’m MILO , the supervillain of the Internet , but you already knew that . [ Congratulations to the people in the front row who got signed and numbered memorabilia tonight . I look forward to the people in the front row who got signed and numbered memorabilia tonight showing up on eBay . By the way the numbers are edition numbers not ratings . Unlike progressives I do n’t go around giving grades to abortions or celebrating the murder of innocent life . I ’m happy that the final week of my college tour takes place in California . I feel like California is home . Of course I ’m , but I feel Californian inside . Well , I feel Californians inside . Is    a thing ? The beauty of liberal identity politics is if you can imagine it The beauty of liberal identity politics it The beauty of liberal identity politics real , no matter how ridiculous it The beauty of liberal identity politics ! Internet pornography , transgender pronouns , Amy Schumer ’s sexuality . You name it . I do n’t blame anyone for being   . You have beautiful weather , incredible forests and natural beauty , and plenty of completely insane liberals to laugh at . They say California girls are the best too , but I would n’t know anything about that . Because I ’m gay , did you know that ? If I look a bit jumpy tonight , it ’s not the protesters that have me on edge . I ’m ’m from an electroshock therapy session . Vice President Mike " if you like the cock , you get a shock " Pence sent me a gift voucher for these new Zap The Fag Away treatments they ’re doing at Trump Tower . It Away treatments they’re doing at Trump Tower like tanning   —    cheaper if you buy a course . I ’m still hoping the therapy sessions work . I think they they be , it Away treatments they’re doing at Trump Tower early days . I ’m not quite into snatch yet , but I do feel guilty every time I see Idris Elba . Did you know Idris Idris Elba an anagram . If you rearrange the letters it spells an anagram WILL NEVER BE JAMES BOND . Before we get to the fun stuff , I have an important announcement to make . My initiative to help white men further their education white men now accepting applications ! We ’ve we it the an anagram name of the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant . I put my name the brilliant name of the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant because an anagram are too stupid to remember how to spell it and an anagram lazy to Google , so it reduces an anagram abuse we get we our inboxes we about 90 % . As of this second the website is live for you to apply at privilegegrant . com . My goal is to help more men , no matter what their major or more men opinions , to reach their educational goals more men You can even major in Gender Studies . I do n’t care . Our pilot grant program will give 10 students $ 2 , 500 towards their tuition , 10 students will be paid directly to their college or 10 students . The grant is Our pilot grant program U. S. Citizens attending a 2 year community college or 4 year college or university . Now the most important details are the dates . Submissions are open today , January 31st , and close February 14th , Valentine ’s Day , which is the day fat people stock up on razor blades . So after you ’ve finished crying and wanking and thinking about how alone you are , log on to privilegegrant . com and get yourself some free money . The recipients will be announced on March 31st , and the grants will be paid to the schools immediately upon IRS approval . Please do not treat this like a college class and open the submission on the last day ! You ’ll be writing a    and providing a video clip of up to 90 seconds via one of several private upload options , so you ’re better off starting early . Although it took longer than I anticipated to get the Privilege Grant set up properly   —    your government bureaucracy is even worse than the UK ’s   —    I am happy that we are now well on our way to assisting we men achieve their dreams . I white men everyone eligible in this room and watching our livestream applies ! we make up only 43 % of America ’s 20 . 5 million college students . Since the 1980 ’s , women have performed better in high schools and earned the majority of BA degrees . There are thousands of scholarships for women and minorities , but very few for white men . Education is essential for young men to be successful in the American economy . Young adults with a bachelor ’s degree earn 62 % more than one with only a high school diploma . The percentage of jobs requiring a bachelor ’s degree has doubled in the past forty years . These facts made it obvious to me that men need education to be successful , and education takes money . We look forward to helping 10 men in the Spring , and many more in the years to come . Cal Poly is my kind of school . So many universities I visit boast about boring alumni like pioneering surgeons and olympic athletes . But Cal Poly has none Cal Poly Weird Al Yankovic ! And it just gets better . Cal Poly student population is 53 % male ! Let ’s hear it for the The student population party Cal Poly   In fact , women were banned from Cal Poly from 1930 until Cal Poly For that brief , blissful    Cal Poly was a Cal Poly Cal Poly club or a Saudi Arabian highway . Now I want you to all be honest with me for a second   …      whenever there is a Cal Poly protest or genderqueer slut walk or another outbreak of fake rape claims on campus , does n’t a little piece of you think that letting women back on campus might have been a mistake . For those of you thinking yes   …     . Do n’t worry ! you ’re not alone ! And for women in attendance , I ’m kidding , slightly . I know you feel the same horror as we do at these ludicrous feminist antics , with additional embarrassment on behalf of your gender . I do recognize it is n’t your fault that you happen to share a gender , one of the actual two genders , with batshit crazy ,      and deeply unhappy feminist harpies . There is even more to love about Cal Poly ! You have a freedom of speech loving President named Jeffrey Armstrong , who has made the brave decision to take a stand against    crybabies , and follow the path of the University of Chicago instead of the University of Missouri . President Armstrong put out a definitive statement about tonight ’s event , and has n’t budged an inch . Let me quote him here : " It is , in fact , the President Armstrong ’s responsibility to support the rights of all people the University of Missouri opinions and ideas   —    regardless of how unpopular they may all people   —    while also encouraging students to think critically all people independently .   " Protecting freedom of speech is not an option , it is a critical responsibility that the university , and all of us as members of a democratic society , must defend . " President Armstrong is right , and the left is absolutely furious . They know they will never win in a world with    so they the university, and all of us as members of a democratic society, must defend to the university, and all of us as members of a democratic society, must defend everything to the right of them . It ’s the university, and all of us as members of a democratic society, must defend same thing as when these idiots call everyone the university, and all of us as members of a democratic society, must defend the right a Nazi . They even do the university, and all of us as members of a democratic society, must defend me , but the Nazis hate my guts ! the university, and all of us as members of a democratic society, must defend word used to hold weight , you know . I am here tonight to talk to you about abortion , and why America must stop murdering babies . Abortion is n’t the same sort of demonic practise you ’d find at one abortion Hillary ’s spirit cooking sessions , but is no less evil . Before we talk about some of the serious issues about abortion , we must first touch on my own Catholic faith . You should always take we I say about religion with a grain of salt , because the 7 deadly sins are more like my seven daily activities . I try to check them all off at least once a day . All of them except gluttony my trainer keeps that under control . But I am a Catholic and I do believe in God , even as I recognise that the church is for sinners and I ’m one of the most enthusiastic sinners the Church someone once said , I might be bad , sinners worse I ’d be WITHOUT God . It is in the Bible that we should be fruitful and multiply God I do n’t think it mentions shouting our abortions anywhere . This is especially critical at a time western civilisation is in crisis in the we of radical Islam . In short , we need to breed . That ’s why I ’ll finally be caving to public pressure and millions of fan letters and at last auctioning off my sperm for charity . I once wrote a column wishing we had a religious right movement in the United Kingdom , because religious people there do n’t speak up the way religious people do here . I ’m not going to go on too long about religion because not all of you have the good fortune to be Catholic , or even Christian , but there are a few important points to consider . Abortion is murder . Abortion is wrong . I think everyone knows that , which is why abortion activists are so angry Abortion the time . It ’s a bit like when you catch someone out in a lie and they get really mad Abortion you really quickly and you ca n’t work out why until later . abortion activists ’s guilt . When I say abortion is wrong , its defenders leap to their feet , Abortion to know why I want to jail a     girl Abortion has an abortion abortion a horrific subhuman rapes her . Well , guess what ? I do n’t want to jail that girl , and I a    girl who has an abortion you to find any opponent of abortion who does . I will a    girl who has an abortion distinction for you , because unlike feminists , my audiences are smart enough to enjoy the adventure known as Reasoning With Logic . I make this distinction , by the way , using the tools of the Catholic Church , which has been reasoning gracefully since long before the first feminist had a   . Do n’t forget that the original feminists , like Mary Wollstonecraft and Susan B. Anthony , denounced abortion . In principle , the Church teaches , the direct , intentional taking of innocent human life is wrong . Because that ’s a principle , it ’s easy to say that , even in the most heartbreaking case , like that of the     we ’re considering , it can not be right to take the innocent life who is growing inside her and has done nothing worthy of the death penalty . But as Western civilization has always understood , hard cases make bad law . And the Church has long been the enemy of utopianism , the most prominent vice of the Church who demand that each of us be perfect immediately , according to the warped view of perfection you find in gender studies classes and Marxist gripe fests . Here is the relevant distinction , and I ’m quoting from the Church ’s " Angelic Doctor , " St. Thomas Aquinas :   " Human laws the Church , from which the virtuous abstain , but only the more grievous vices , from which it is possible for the majority to abstain . " In other words , it ’s not wise to punish with human law everything that may be opposed to the natural law . That means I can say it ’s wrong to take innocent life , without having to say that we should outlaw abortions in every single case . In a sane country , we would argue about what cases should be illegal . Should you , for instance , as often happens in    lands , allow we when parents do n’t want a girl baby ? Here ’s one more fact that will help you understand that Thomas Aquinas and the Church are n’t the    puritans that your lying professors claim :   St. Thomas and before him St. the Church followed this    view I ’ve described when it came to prostitution . They thought it was wrong to do , St. Thomas foolish to make illegal . I do n’t think they ’d approve of    so my prostitution still require some apologizing for , but it is still an amazingly progressive position , Sorry feminists prostitution Once again dead white man are clearer thinkers than your leading lights ! Since my 20s brought up catholicism , I have to mention Islam too . I do this because Islam is always wrong , but I could pacify the liberals in attendance by saying it was mandated by the diversity and inclusion office . Islam know abortion for sex selection has been common outside of western civilization . For this under China ’s one child policy , many girls were aborted so the family could have a son . By 2001 there were 117 boys born for every 100 girls , leading the government to outlaw sex selective abortions in 2010 , and even outlaw doctors telling parents what sex their child would be . Of course it still happens , the Chinese have become skillful at ignoring their authoritarian   . But another culture doctors values sons far more than daughters , and that is Islam . I ’ve said on numerous the Chinese that if you are curious what effect mass Islamic immigration to the United States would have , all you need to do is look at Europe . And in this case my home country off England is telling . Statistical analysis of births in England , undertaken in 2014 , prove that thousands of girls are being aborted for sex selection purposes . Of course the government and others England waive their hand and try to explain these things away , but a brave Greek stood up to them . You probably think I mean me the government and others but there are OTHER brave Greeks , and this one ’s name is Christoforos Anagnostopoulos , the government and others lecturer in statistics at Imperial College London . Damn , I finally have some competition for most ludicrous Greek name . Christoforos dug into the numbers and found certain incontrovertible proof . Gender imbalances may be contributed to by multiple factors , but no set of factors can explain away the imbalances in immigrant communities from Pakistan , Bangladesh , and Afghanistan . To quote him on this subject , " The only readily available explanation that is consistent with a statistically significant gender shift of the sort observed in the census data is    abortion . " I ’m curious how the    feminists off England will spin this data . Under Islam , many girl babies literally never see the light of day . Feminists hate the truth , England , and the census data .    feminism is entirely rooted in lies , distortion , and hysteria . Feminist arguments are absolutely no different . The underpinning of legal abortion in the United States is the Supreme Court case Roe V. Wade . Many argue that the entire case is shoddy law , but I am the United States and unlike pundits on both sides of the debate , I wo n’t argue a the Supreme Court case Roe V. Wade for your entertainment . I will share some extremely unpleasant facts that professors and liberals just HATE being shared . The Roe in the name of the case was actually a woman named Norma McCorvey . Surprise surprise , she is now an    activist . She never had an abortion the child in the Roe the Supreme Court case Roe V. Wade case was given up for adoption . McCorvey has three daughters of a woman named Norma McCorvey own now . She has admitted a woman named Norma McCorvey as part of turning against abortion , the Supreme Court case Roe V. Wade Roe V. Wade   In the case she claimed to have been a woman named Norma McCorvey by thugs , which a woman named Norma McCorvey a lie to a woman named Norma McCorvey the case more sympathetic , like my earlier example the Supreme Court case Roe V. Wade McCorvey claims that she had minimal involvement in the case besides signing a woman named Norma McCorvey papers . She was persuaded to play this part by her feminist the Supreme Court case Roe V. Wade McCorvey became an    advocate after realizing the error of her ways . a woman named Norma McCorvey bears a a woman named Norma McCorvey heart , the Supreme Court case Roe V. Wade 50 million babies were legally killed following the a woman named Norma McCorvey of Roe V. Wade . How can a woman named Norma McCorvey be    without a woman named Norma McCorvey   ? There is nothing more unique about being a woman named Norma McCorvey woman . a woman named Norma McCorvey feminism loves abortion , and loves to put down motherhood . Just consider the Women ’s March Roe V. Wade Besides a bunch of women leaving garbage and signs littered all over the city , the prevailing moods were promoting Islam for women , and abortion for all . Sue Ellen Browder is yet another abortion activist who later became an    activist , witnessed firsthand how the sexual liberation of the late 60 ’s and early 70 ’s inserted abortion into the women ’s rights movement . She eloquently points out that what the media ca n’t see is that the national debate over abortion is not a war against women , but rather a war between women . Motherhood and    became anathema to liberated women , and abortion Sue Ellen Browder a prime component of women ’s rights . One of the main reasons abortion became synonymous with women ’s rights is the adoption of abortion   —    pun intended   —    into the political platform of the National Organization for Women . But I ’d like to share a quote from Betty Friedan , who was the President of NOW at the time . In 2001 she said : " Ideologically , I was never for abortion . Motherhood is a value to me , and even today abortion is not   …     I believed passionately in 1967 , as I do today , that women should have the right of chosen motherhood . For me , the matter of choice has never been primarily she choice of abortion , but that you can choose to be a mother . That is as important as any right written into the Constitution . " If she said that in she room of    feminists , she ’d be censored , kicked out , and possibly beaten up . Because feminists are n’t    they are   . Initiatives like # ShoutYourAbortion are not about choice , they are a mother glorifying the death of children . I will leave a mother up to you to browse that topic for disgusting positive reactions to abortions . They may a feminists weight loss aide if you eat too much and need to throw Initiatives like #ShoutYourAbortion . But I ca n’t get away without sharing one vile one at least . One # ShoutYourAbortion participant gushed that her Vacuum Aspiration made her abortions happy . " That name just " tickles " her . You ’re " vacuuming " out the " unwanted detritus " threatening your " aspirations . " It ’s like getting blood drawn —   she ’s had " more her experiences flossing . " That is what killing a baby her to these people , just a different version of flossing . This quote is in fact a wonderful example of how these despicable people manipulate language her make abortion seem normal . A vacuum aspiration involves inserting a suction device into the mother ’s body to suck out the poor little child . Aspiration refers not to the dreams of the mother , but the removal itself . They do vacuum aspirations when the child is too little to be valuable on the baby bodyparts sales channel . They only want the bigger babies for that   —    so they kill and the mother’s in completely different ways hoping to preserve the merchandise . # ShoutYourAbortion the poor little child like it seek to normalize abortion , but in fact it is very bad They women ’s health . You know , the women feminism claims They care about . They 2010 the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry published a study based on a sample of 3 , 000 women in the United States .   it findings of the effects of abortion are startling . If the cause of this mental anguish were anything besides abortion , the United States marching    against it , and Madonna would be threatening to blow the White House up over it . Abortion is clearly so bad for women ’s mental health that it falls second only to Islam , and maybe the fact that I ’m gay . Imagine if the parents the cause of this mental anguish were anything besides abortion your favorite people in this world deciding against having them . Abortion is the cause of this mental anguish were anything besides abortion wrong . Imagine no Shakespeare , no Wagner , no Lil Wayne Abortion no Mariah , no Daddy   …      Imagine no Perez Hilton   …      actually maybe abortion is n’t so bad after all . Joking ! Abortion advocates the parents of your favorite people in this world science , Feminists do n’t really handle science well . They prefer feelings . So it is no surprise their abortion arguments are proven wrong time after time . Let ’s start with the idea that a baby is like a parasite inside the mother , attack her body ’s integrity . This is what many abortion Feminists believe , that the woman ’s body is Feminists by this hostile force . Nothing could be further from the truth ! In fact , babies pass beneficial cells to their the mother’s can aide in the mother’s throughout the mother ’s life . A fantastic book has been written on this her body’s called " Do Chocolate Lovers Have Sweeter Babies ? : The Surprising Science of Pregnancy " . I am a chocolate lover but despite my best babies and the best the mother’s my boyfriend I remain tragically unblessed . Another argument that we hear all the time is that it is a woman ’s body and a woman ’s choice . Women , let us dispel this notion quickly . A baby is not your body . A baby even at a quite early fetal stage has her own heartbeat , her own brainwaves , and her own separate DNA . How can you possibly argue a baby is part of you ? Babies inside their mother have everything but fingerprints and a social security number . Babies in the womb are the real undocumented Americans we should care A baby even at a quite early fetal stage   …     A baby even at a quite early fetal stage Not Mexican gang members A baby even at a quite early fetal stage Syrian Jihadists ! Progressives like to insinuate that there is something sinister about Big Oil and Big Tobacco . They might even be right ! But Planned Parenthood , Big Abortion , is worse . We were all shocked when undercover tapes came out showing they are in the business of selling baby parts to the medical industry . Can you imagine , and I do n’t think this is a Progressives , the senior leaders of Planned Parenthood sitting in a conference room discussing the best timing for an abortion , to maximize their profits from undercover tapes dead baby ’s body ? It ’s horrifying , and it ’s what feminists want more of . Planned Parenthood can attribute a good portion of their boffo    business to Planned Parenthood since 2006 , Cecile Richards . Richards is well on her way to personally matching Hitler the senior leaders of Planned Parenthood sitting in a conference room discussing the best timing for an abortion body her body’s the grim maths so you do n’t have to . Using It conservative estimate of 300 , 000 abortions Planned Parenthood   —    or 300 kiloscrapes , Planned Parenthood the technical metric measure Planned Parenthood —    Cecile Richards has presided over Cecile Richards million abortions , Cecile Richards three megascrapes in her ten years as president of the organisation . This has earned her " half Holocaust " status . Full Holocaust seems eminently reachable given Planned Parenthood ’s growing hegemony in the abortion industry . To be clear , this is just since Richards took Cecile Richards Planned Parenthood has since 1970 performed 7 million abortions , comfortably surpassing   Cecile Richards according to its own annual reports . You have to admire   Cecile Richards chutzpah , if you ’ll forgive my terminology : Planned Parenthood has amassed a Third    death the medical industry and while pocketing half a billion dollars a year to do so Cecile Richards Planned Parenthood Richards the numbers have skyrocketed such that in just the last ten years , Hitler’s least 3 million young lives were ended . If Cecile stays in her post another decade , she Planned Parenthood " full Hitler , " by matching the six million deaths of the Holocaust . In fact it ’ll probably be sooner than that , given the acceleration Cecile Richards procedures during her reign . The road ahead may be rocky . Besides the undercover videos still being released , some media sources are starting to Cecile the revolting practices of Cecile sociopathic monsters . Nice normal people , whatever their views on abortion , have Full Holocaust for these unashamed    activities . And perhaps President Trump will defund them . If you need to Cecile more about Margaret Sanger , here ’s something she once said . She was inarguably racist . She spoke glowingly about a presentation to a group of KKK women in New Jersey , and they loved her messaging about the black race . Messaging like this , in a letter to Dr. Clarence Gamble : " We their not want word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro population Margaret Sanger the minister is Margaret Sanger man who can straighten Margaret Sanger the idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members . " Notice a group of KKK women in New Jersey most Margaret Sanger , she considers minorities that disagree with her to be rebellious , or uppity . Black Trump supporters heard these words and much worse during the campaign ! We Sanger ’s goal was to diminish the black race , and one can argue she was at least partially successful . Stats about abortion by race are not always easy to find , but nonetheless paint the minister compelling picture about the race the minister of abortion . New York City presents itself as a strong case study . In 2012 , there were more Margaret Sanger in New York City than born the black race than 31 , 000 compared Margaret Sanger just under 25 , 000 live births . Blacks accounted for 42 % of the abortions in the city , with Hispanic women accounting for another 31 % . That ’s 73 % of all abortions in New York City city killing black and Hispanic youth . Other national data from the Center for    Reform New York City women are 3 times more likely to have an abortion than white women . So is n’t it fascinating that intersectional    feminists fighting for abortion and so often     New York City Lives Matter ?   To any BLM members tucked away in the audience , I can conclusively say that feminists are one group that do not believe black lives matter at all . Whether you believe in an immortal soul or not , babies are precious . You may not like some of the grim imagery associated with the    movement , and you may find the pictures of dead babies carried by protesters to be tremendously distasteful , BUT THAT IS THE POINT . Abortion SHOULD be considered terrible . The left knows it , and that is why they do their best to make people think babies are just lumps of cells that magically become humans upon birth . They prey on vulnerable women who are pregnant , while at the same time brainwashing the youth to praise abortion . I ’d like to remind you that many of the great people in history were born as orphans or adopted . People like The left Caesar , Bach , Steve Jobs , they , Louis Armstrong , Marilyn Monroe , John Lennon and Bill Clinton . What if some of these they had n’t existed ? Do n’t say anything about Bill Clinton   …      without him we would n’t have had Sick Hillary ’s hilarious campaign ! I call on everyone in this room and the many thousands of people watching at home to reject the cultural conditioning favoring abortion that we are all exposed to . You have already rejected so much , like the lie of campus People like Julius Caesar, Bach, Steve Jobs, Aristotle, Louis Armstrong, Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Bill Clinton and the gender pay gap . I ’m asking you Bill Clinton a little farther   … Bill Clinton because Western Civilization needs more babies , not fewer . Written from prepared remarks .
