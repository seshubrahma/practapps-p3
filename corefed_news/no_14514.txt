Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump widened President Donald Trump search for a new national security adviser this weekend amid concerns in Washington that the forced resignation of Michael Flynn leaves the White House unprepared to face any sudden foreign policy crisis . Michael Flynn short tenure ended when he Michael Flynn asked to resign after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his Michael Flynn calls with the Russian ambassador . Trump interviewed several candidates to replace Flynn Michael Flynn Sunday , according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders . " He Trump several interviews and    meetings that are still ongoing as of this afternoon talking to different candidates for the national security adviser position , " she Trump reporters . On Saturday , White White House Sean Spicer told reporters that Trump planned to speak to former US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton , acting national security adviser Gen. Keith Kellogg , West Point Superintendent Lt . Gen. Robert Caslen , Lt . Gen. H. R. McMaster , who directs the Army Capabilities Integration Center , and " potentially more " candidates .   Sanders confirmed those four Trump planned to speak to former US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, acting national security adviser Gen. Keith Kellogg, West Point Superintendent Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, who directs the Army Capabilities Integration Center, and "potentially more" candidates interviewed , adding : " We may have some Trump planned to speak to former US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, acting national security adviser Gen. Keith Kellogg, West Point Superintendent Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, who directs the Army Capabilities Integration Center, and "potentially more" candidates names tomorrow and he may also meet Sanders a couple of those people again . " Two other candidates , former Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal and former CIA Director David Petraeus , are no longer in the mix , sources told CNN Friday night . The    for the post , Vice Adm. Bob Harward , dropped out of consideration apparently over concerns that he could not bring Sanders own staff to Sanders National Security Council . Sanders refuted that Sunday , saying reports that candidates were told they could not bring candidates their own teams were candidates and that it has " been made clear " to the new candidates " that they can bring on the new candidates own teams . the new candidates There were signs of strong support inside and outside the administration for Bolton . Sen. Ted Cruz ,    told CNN in an interview that the foreign policy veteran would make a " very , very , strong " national security adviser because he understands the threat the foreign policy veteran " radical Islamic terrorism . " Bolton , a controversial Bolton who had to secure a recess appointment to serve as President George W. Bush ’s ambassador to the United Nations after failing to win Senate confirmation , is emerging as a strong favorite among political staffers on the NSC . While there is a lot of affection for Kellogg , Bolton Bolton brings a mix of    credentials that fit Trump ’s political temperament and    knowledge of Washington and how the foreign policy process works , a senior administration official said . The official said Bolton is close to both CIA Director Mike Pompeo and a senior administration official who Bolton " extremely powerful at this point " and so may have some sway on who gets the job . In the end , however , it will be up to Trump to decide who he is most comfortable working with . Should Bolton Trump the job , Bolton staffers want Kellogg to stay on as Bolton chief of the job The sense of limbo is causing concern among lawmakers and foreign policy experts who understand how the National Security Council corrals rival foreign policy power centers in the government and its crucial role at a time of crisis . " There is no doubt after the government departure of Flynn and everything that led up to it that the NSC is in a little bit of chaos , " Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois told CNN Friday . GOP Sen. John McCain also questioned the state of White House foreign policy earlier in the week . Every presidency brings change and uncertainty to American foreign policy . But Trump ’s arrival in the White House has been especially disorientating for US allies , since he adopted positions White House trail     for example , questioning the value of US alliances Trump’s Europe and Asia that have underpinned    War II peace     that appeared to threaten wholesale upheaval in the international system . Adding personnel uncertainties to that mix is underscoring the sense of instability that Trump has brought international relations . As they await their new boss , national security staffers are hunkering down and forging ahead with their work . they senior administration official strongly refuted claims that the NSC was in chaos , they that it is functioning exactly as it should be , despite Flynn ’s departure , and is primed the NSC any crisis that would arise . " It is dead wrong , " said the official , who requested anonymity to discuss a sensitive situation . " The NSC was instrumental in the rollout of the Venezuela drug kingpin designation , the NSC arranged the NSC the NSC Venezuelan dissidents with the President . The NSC is instrumental in setting the NSC prepping and briefing all the President ’s foreign leader calls of the NSC the NSC a couple every day . " " Everyone is carrying on as normal , " the official said , pointing to a string of successful meetings between Trump and foreign leaders in recent weeks . Harward ’s decision not to take the job revealed the fact that potential candidates will likely have to agree to keep on staffers already brought into the NSC . In a statement to CNN , the former Navy SEAL cited family reasons for his decision . But a friend of Harward said he was reluctant to sign up because the White House seems the former Navy SEAL chaotic . A Republican official told Harward that a friend of Harward was not convinced he would be able to bring in his own staff . Trump ’s top CNN have Harward clear that candidates A Republican official most of the top political appointees A Republican official came in with Flynn will stay     in a bid to avoid disarray . " We are in an unprecedented situation , " the official said . " Somebody coming in is going to have Trump’s understand it is not going to be A Republican official it would have been had they been picked November 10 and had a whole transition to pick their staff . " it visits of British Prime Minister Theresa May , Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , Israeli Prime they Benjamin Netanyahu and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , however , sent reassuring signals to US allies . One senior member of one of the delegations said that Trump and those around him had pleasantly surprised their visitors with evidence that they were beginning to understand the complexity of foreign policy and managing Trump , despite their Trump and those around him . Internal tensions , Trump and those around him , a vacancy for a national security adviser would spark intense jockeying for position Trump and those around him the national security establishment in Washington     given the job ’s proximity to the President and central role as the White House ’s foreign policy first responder . And Trump ’s failure to find a quick replacement for Flynn is shining a spotlight on the internal tensions in his administration . Harward ’s decision revived Washington scuttlebutt about the extent to which political influences are weighing on the national Flynn team in the White House following Washington ’s executive order reserving a spot for his controversial adviser Steve Bannon in NSC principals committee meetings . " If Trump been in his position , being offered Flynn top job in national security , a job that anyone in that profession would want , Flynn would want to make sure I had control over the staff and that the NSC was not being influenced by the President ’s political advisers , " said Tony Blinken , a former deputy secretary NSC and deputy national security adviser for President Barack Obama . " I suspect that Bob Harward , looking at this job , looking at this possibility would have said , ’Yes , but that has to stop,’ and if he did n’t get those assurances , he is probably right not to do it , " Blinken told CNN ’s Brooke Baldwin stop,’ Bannon is not the only member stop,’ Trump ’s political team who has carved out a sphere of influence on foreign policy . stop,’ President ’s     Jared Kushner emerged as the key interlocutor between foreign leaders and the new president during the transition period and early in the new administration , diplomats said . Trying to keep security council stable The President said the White House is concerned that the council     an organization that is already in an uneasy position after Flynn ’s early Jared Kushner would be further destabilized if the top staffers in the organization were asked to resign in order to make room for the next national security adviser ’s staff . " They do n’t want to see big changes at the NSC and therefore that is going to be a condition for anybody taking the job , the White House the official the NSC But military officers especially , one White House aide said , bring with them a host of people , so encouraging staff stay Jared Kushner to what the next National Security Adviser would want . Harward ’s decision not to accept military officers especially job also raised eyebrows because of the unspoken military code that when a President calls , service Harward’s and accept the mission . Who has Trump ’s ear ? The Defense Department has also welcomed the somewhat looser oversight being conducted by the Trump White House , which has Trump lighter hand so far than the former Obama administration . That new regime has also been noted at the State Department , where one official said that there was little his administration between Foggy Bottom President Barack Obama the West Wing . Former Obama administration State Department spokesman and White House Communications Director Jen Psaki warned that a prolonged vacuum on the NSC would soon start reverberating around the world . " If President Barack Obama are working in an embassy The Defense Department a diplomatic the NSC the NSC around the world , you are wondering who has Trump ’s ear , who is speaking on behalf of the United States , " Psaki said on CNN International on Friday . Still , one Trump ironies the world uncertainty surrounding the NSC is Friday foreign policy     at least as far as it relates to visits by key foreign White House Communications Director Jen Psaki     has been the NSC the NSC smoothest areas of the administration so far .
