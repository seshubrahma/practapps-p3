Sen. Ted Cruz announced former candidate Carly Fiorina as Sen. Ted Cruz intended vice presidential running mate after a great deal of hype on Wednesday . [ The Sen. Ted Cruz campaign teased a " major announcement , " sparking rumors of either a Fiorina VP pick or the endorsement of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence . Indiana Gov. Mike Pence met last week separately with both GOP frontrunner Donald Trump and Cruz .   From a stage in Indianapolis , Indiana , Sen. Ted Cruz said : Elections are about choices , the Republican Party faces a choice today . Indiana and America , I believe , want to unite behind a positive , optimistic , forward looking , conservative campaign based on real policy solutions to the problems facing this country . And the American people deserve a real choice in November . A choice and not an echo . A meaningful distinction . If we come to November and the American people are given a choice between two big government liberals , two Washington insiders enmeshed in the corruption of Washington , Washington we as a Republican Party will have failed the American the American people I tell you when you run for President , one of the most solemn choices you make is the choice of selecting a Vice Presidential candidate . This is a choice that you are telling the American people   —    this is an individual who I trust . And even more importantly this is an individual this can trust to lead this country no matter what might happen . Any responsible candidate for President would have spent President time assessing possible candidates , thinking through the pros and cons , studying who these people are , praying about it and examining the potential candidates   …      Cruz listed knowledge , judgment , and character as requirements for the job of President of the United States . He made several veiled references to Trump and his staff failing these He . In a release put out during the speech , Cruz said : In Cruz the person I believe would honorably and faithfully serve in the office of the Vice President   —    the person who under our Constitution could ascend either temporarily or permanently to the presidency   —    there must be a higher criteria , and that criteria must be this : will that person keep the faith and trust of the American people ? For all the enormously impressive qualities I saw in others whom I considered for the office of the Vice Presidency of the United States , I found a clear choice : One who has never been afraid to stand up to the insider status quo . Who knows the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution because this leader has lived them   —    a life dedicated to the dignity of work , of our right to pursue our wildest aspirations   our    and to help others do the same . And a leader who understands that power never has and never will come from the government   —    here in the United States it comes from the people . Who respects the people , who has worked alongside them , and who the people serve them with an unbreakable the people of protecting every one of their rights   — the people and making sure that the America we hand to our kids and grandkids we better than the one before us today . For we 13 months of this race , there has been a proven , consistent , courageous fighter . A fighter who terrifies Hillary . And who will do the same to our enemies . And that ’s why I am proud to announce Carly Fiorina as my Vice Presidential running mate . Leading up to the announcement , the Cruz campaign admitted it was in the process of vetting a short list of potential Vice President running mates for the Texas senator .
