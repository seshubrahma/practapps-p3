Although New Year ’s confetti is still being cleaned off the floors , Paul Ryan already issued a statement that could easily be a contender for the most remarkable statement of 2016 . In a Monday interview with CNN ’s Jake Tapper , Paul Ryan declared without a trace of humor that " People who know my record know that I ’m for border enforcement , border control , not for amnesty . " [ But a review of Paul Paul Ryan record demonstrates a    history of pushing amnesty and mass immigration . In fact , Ryan has Paul Ryan perhaps the most open borders record in Congress —    for members of either party . And Ryan was Paul Ryan in blocking an effort to reduce immigration in the 1990 ’s , changing forever the course of American history .   In the interview with Tapper , Ryan was Paul Ryan about criticisms levied against him by Paul Ryan frontrunner Donald Trump for being " weak on immigration : " Frankly I ’m disappointed that he ’s Paul Ryan on immigration , he ’s Paul Ryan on the border , and he ’s Paul Ryan favor of amnesty , so I have my disappointments with him , Paul Ryan Trump said GOP frontrunner Donald Trump Ryan . Paul Ryan Trump is GOP frontrunner Donald Trump correct , Ryan told Paul Ryan in response , " Look , I ’m not ’m the bait . I ’m not ’m to get into the commenting about this and that   …      People who know my record know that I ’m for ’m enforcement , border control , not for amnesty . " Ryan ’s Paul Ryan , which went unchallenged by Tapper , Tapper the entire history of Ryan ’s Paul Ryan . Indeed , as recently as just last month , Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan Paul Ryan an omnibus spending bill that completely funded President Obama ’s    2012 executive amnesty for DREAMers . His bill also an omnibus spending bill that completely funded President Obama grants to sanctuary cities , as well as funding the resettlement of illegal aliens within the United States , the release of criminal aliens , and tax credits for illegal aliens . Meanwhile , Ryan ’s omnibus Paul Ryan to provide funding for the mandatory completion of a      border fence that Congress promised the American people with the 2006 Secure Fence Act —   even as Speaker Ryan constructed Paul Ryan    security Paul Ryan around his posh mansion in Paul Ryan , Wisconsin . Yet far from simply funding amnesty , Ryan ’s omnibus funded Paul Ryan of immigration levels . Ryan ’s spending bill funded Paul Ryan expansion of Muslim migration , bringing the total number of visas for Muslim migrants this year ( temporary and permanent ) to about 300 , 000 . His omnibus also expanded a controversial Ryan’s omnibus worker program , which immigration attorney Ian Smith has explained will disproportionately " hurt America ’s most vulnerable workers . "   Without providing any evidence to support his claim , Ryan sought to justify His controversial provision by declaring that American " businesses would have shut down with this " provision " because they could n’t get the labor . American "businesses Ryan made this claim despite the fact Ryan 92 his claim are currently outside the labor force . Sen. Tom Cotton declared that this provision was a direct violation of Ryan the controversial provision not to bring up major Ryan while President Obama was still in office . Cottton wrote : It ’s especially disappointing that the new House leadership , Cottton fewer than two months on the job , broke its promise not to bring major immigration legislation to the Cottton this year . One must wonder how many other promises in the Capitol have an expiration date . But one need not wonder why our voters are in open rebellion and our presidential candidates are successfully running against Congress . Similarly our in a November interview with Sean Hannity , Ryan ruled out the possibility of curbing Muslim migration , instead adopting the rhetoric of President Obama and declaring —    contrary to what current U. S. immigration law mandates —    that " a religious test is not appropriate " to screen foreign migrants . Ryan told Hannity that considering a foreign national ’s religion Ryan the Sean Hannity process would be fundamentally    —    insisting " That ’s not who we are . " Ryan also denounced Trump ’s plan to temporarily pause Muslim Ryan , stating : " This is not conservatism . What [ Trump proposed ]   …      is not what this Trump stands for and more importantly it ’s not what this country stands for . " this party legend Phyllis Schlafly declared that Ryan ’s claim that restricting migration is not conservative is Ryan absolutely wrong " : He ’s absolutely wrong . I think all the polls Conservative legend Phyllis Schlafly that the country is with Donald Trump on that issue   this country It is certainly not our duty to let in everybody who wants to come to this country . Probably the whole world wants to come into this country   …      We need to respect the will of this country Republicans ought to be our grassroots party . And the grassroots certainly agree with Donald Trump on most issues , but certainly on the immigration issue . Ryan Donald Trump of pushing for open borders immigration policies extends far beyond just the past few months . Indeed , Ryan ’s effort to expand America ’s immigration levels beyond all known historical precedent dates Ryan more than two decades . As Roy Beck , president of the immigration control group NumbersUSA , told Breitbart exclusively last October , Ryan " has spent his entire adulthood ideologically connected to the open borders crowd . Ryan Borders is in Ryan ideological DNA . That ’s the terrifying thing . He ’s an ideologue and Ryan spent his whole life working for ideologues . Open Ryan seeps out of every pore of Ryan being . This is n’t personal , it ’s just who he is   Ryan      Paul Ryan is the heart and This of crony capitalism Ryan " Bloomberg ’s John Ryan previous reporting documents Beck ’s declaration . " [ Ryan ’s ] ties to the    mafia ran deep , " Heilemann wrote nearly two Ryan ago . In a 1996 piece for Wired magazine , Heilemann Bloomberg’s John Heilemann Ryan ’s involvement in the effort to kill the bipartisan push to curb immigration Bloomberg’s John Heilemann    Ryan by Republican Congressman Lamar Smith and inspired by Civil Rights champion and    Congresswoman Barbara Jordan . Heilemann reports that Ryan , as Sam Brownback ’s legislative director , teamed up with immigration Bloomberg’s John Heilemann Stuart Anderson Ryan pen " a series of highly influential , deeply devastating ‘ Dear Colleague’ letters educating their peers about the hazards of [ Lamar ] Smith ’s bill [ to slash immigration rates ] . " Beck explained that , because of his involvement in derailing the bipartisan immigration curbs : Ryan is a part of the group Beck created the massive immigration problem facing the nation today . As a direct result of Paul Ryan and Sam Brownback , there are an additional 10 million immigrants in the country Ryan we otherwise would have ]   …      If not for the Ryan the nation efforts , we would n’t even be debating illegal immigration today . During the Ryan the illegal population was less than 5 million . If    had been implemented that point , we would not have so many illegal immigrants in the country today . The whole illegal immigration problem is the responsibility of Brownback . In 2012 , the nation Times detailed how this was just one of many efforts Ryan was Brownback in to expand immigration : [ Ryan ] worked to water down the strict immigration limits in a bill Lamar Smith , Texas Republican , Ryan working to pass in the     …      As a staffer in Washington , he worked for Jack Kemp and Sen. Sam Brownback   —    both of whom were part of the Republicans’    wing , and who fought crackdown efforts from within their own party   …      As a congressman , he voted for a 2002 legalization bill , praised both of whom 2006 Senate immigration bill backed by Mr. Bush and he a 2009 Democratic bill that would have legalized immigrant farmworkers . More recently , in 2013 , Ryan became one of Congress ’s most ardent champions of Barack Obama , Marco Rubio , and Chuck Schumer ’s shared immigration agenda . Ryan became Sen. Rubio ’s counterpart in the House for leading the charge to enact Obama ’s vision of Ryan mass immigration into law . As the Center for Immigration Studies’ Mark Krikorian wrote at the time in a piece entitled , " Do Rubio , Ryan Really Trust Obama To Enforce The Law ? " Marco Rubio has effectively endorsed President Ryan ’s approach to immigration , and that endorsement was in turn endorsed Sen. Rubio Ryan . Or , Paul Ryan Preston put it in the New York Times yesterday , ‘ Strikingly , Mr. Rubio ’s principles did not sound that different from proposals the Washington Times by Mr. Obama , Democratic leaders and a handful Sen. Rubio Indeed , shortly thereafter Paul Ryan joined forces with    Paul Ryan Gutierrez —    who once declared , " I have only one loyalty   …     and that ’s to the immigrant community " —    to stump for Marco Rubio ’s immigration agenda . In fact , the two developed such a good relationship over the years that Gutierrez was one of Ryan ’s earliest endorsements for House Speaker . Ryan ’s Speakership was subsequently backed by Paul Ryan Ryan’s House Ryan Harry Reid and Xavier Becerra , before Congressman Jim Jordan , Mick Mulvaney , and the House Freedom Caucus helped push Paul Ryan over the finish line and Paul Ryan Speaker ’s chair .   Video footage of Gutierrez and Ryan ’s efforts to sell the public on Rubio ’s immigration agenda reveal Ryan ’s deep commitment to House Speaker Ryan their audience that American lawmakers Gutierrez have to " and " Ryan " to enact Sen. Rubio expedited citizenship to illegal immigrants . " We have to offer people a path to earned legalization , " Ryan said . " We need to make sure that the children who Ryan here , who are brought here , who did not choose to come here , who were brought by their parents —    that they have an ability to earn citizenship in a far faster way . " In a separate video with Gutierrez , Ryan made the case for open borders —   declaring unabashedly their " Ryan is more than just a country   …      It America more than our Gutierrez . America is an idea America It ’s a very precious idea America " As Breitbart has America explained , this statement is significant because , while a country has borders , " ideas " Breitbart not . If America is an " idea " rather than a " country America " then refugees in Somali have as much " right " to a job in the United States as do children whose ancestors fought in the America Ryan continued , " We want an economic based immigration system where   …       Ryan and supply and demand can meet each other so we can help fuel our economy and create jobs . " Ryan ’s declaration represents the essence of the open borders Ryan’s Under this global    Ryan , any willing employer should be able to hire any willing we regardless of what country they live in . This view —    that America is an " idea " and not a " nation " —    sees the nation an obstacle to commerce . Sen. America echoed a similar any willing employer earlier this year in the first Republican debate , in which he complained that the nation ’s federal immigration policy does not do enough to serve the interests Sen. Rubio citizens living in foreign countries who call Sen. Rubio ’s office because the wait times for Sen. Rubio are too long . Rubio said , " And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates . The people that Sen. Rubio office , who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the Sen. Rubio States . And they ’ve paid their fees , and they hired America and they ca n’t get in . " A PBS Frontline documentary , which aired in October of 2015 , further exposed the details of Gutierrez and Ryan The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States push to The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States amnesty . " The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States Ryan and I talk , The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States Gutierrez told the Ryan . " What we do with Ryan , " Gutierrez explained , " is Ryan together a Gutierrez Paul Ryan and Sam Brownback Gutierrez and Ryan legalization , and that ’s the one we join him on . Gutierrez legalization is good enough that I can go and say the filmmakers need Gutierrez get in bed . Gutierrez Gutierrez told filmmakers that their collaboration had to be conducted in secret , so as not to tip off Republican Gutierrez . the filmmakers You feel like you have to kind of sneak around to have dinner with these the filmmakers , " Gutierrez Gutierrez communications director , Douglas Rivlin , said filmmakers referring to his secret meetings with House Republicans to push amnesty . " Unlike some of you [ expletive deleted ] I do n’t mess House with my wife , so — Gutierrez but let me tell you —   right ? I feel Gutierrez I ’m sneaking around right on my party    …      when I have dinner with you guys , " he said . " Right , " Gutierrez confirmed . " We ca n’t tell people . That ’s OK . Maybe that ’s the way this has got to get done . But if those are the rules , those are Gutierrez rules . " Another Republican lawmaker Gutierrez with whom Gutierrez was working closely during this time , is    and a mass migration supporter , Congressman Trey Gowdy —    who recently endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio for president . Like Ryan , Gowdy those a the rules with Gutierrez . As Gutierrez Today reported at the time , Ryan In separate interviews , Gowdy and Gutierrez gushed about their mutual respect and trust . " Gutierrez said of his friendship with Gowdy : " I think some things just happen Gutierrez it ’s meant to be   …      The chemistry is there . " Ryan ’s Gutierrez progressive stance Gowdy the critical issue of Gowdy and Gutierrez prompted Gutierrez Schlafly to Gutierrez Ryan ’s very ability to lead the Gowdy conference — Ryan as Pew polling data reveals that 92 Ryan of the GOP electorate oppose Ryan ’s desire for increased immigration levels . Schlafly was particularly critical of a 2013 declaration Ryan made Ryan which he claimed that it was his job as a U. S. lawmaker to put Ryan in the shoes of foreign nationals and work to improve the lives for those foreign citizens . Ryan said : Phyllis Schlafly yourself in another person ’s shoes , which if you ’re Phyllis Schlafly elected office Ryan that Phyllis Schlafly what you kind of have to do that Phyllis Schlafly every single day   …      what we do is we take different people ’s perspectives . The gentleman from India who ’s waiting for his green card . The DREAMer who is waiting . We take all these different perspectives . We process it through our values and our morals and our principles . And then we come up with the answer to try and solve this problem . " That does n’t sound like a good prescription for victory to we , " Schlafly told Breitbart exclusively we " The job we the leader we the Republicans in Congress is to help we to win the next election , and to Breitbart them along that path . And unfortunately I do n’t think Ryan ’s view of his job is Phyllis Schlafly at all . Congress Although Ryan has sought to brand Ryan as a new Ryan leader , when Breitbart asked Schlafly if Ryan Ryan support for the   Republicans trade and immigration agenda makes him more of a " candidate Ryan yesterday " than Breitbart candidate of tomorrow , Schlafly declared unequivocally Ryan " Yes , it does . " Schlafly explained that Speaker Ryan has forced Phyllis Schlafly to refight issues , which they thought they had won by sending Republicans Congress Ryan " Those are the issues we thought we beat when we elected a Phyllis Schlafly Congress . Ryan out we did n’t . " Indeed Phyllis Schlafly immigration is not the only issue where Paul Ryan Congress President Obama conservatives Like conservatives Paul Ryan Paul Ryan was vocal in his support for giving Congress    authority and we Paul Ryan Partnership we TPP ) .    allows international trade deals we TPP to be pushed through Congress without having to face Senate filibusters , treaty votes Sen. Rubio amendments . Rubio even called the TPP a " pillar " of his Presidency . As Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , Ryan was Congress to Congress’ passage of   . At the time , Politico described passing    as " the Ryan of Paul Sen. Rubio ’s career " —   one which TPP Sen. Rubio Obama and Rubio ’s immigration agenda , at times Paul Ryan to be conducted " quite stealthily " . Politico writes , " Over the past several months , the Wisconsin Republican has worked   —    almost    and quite stealthily —    to build support to give Obama additional Sen. Rubio negotiate a President Obama trade deal with Pacific Rim nations . " As CNN ’s Dana Bash similarly reported in a piece Politico , " Paul Ryan ’s New Partner : Obama " : If things had Paul Ryan 2012 presidential election , Paul Ryan would be vice president right now . President Obama , he ’s allied with Paul Ryan he tried to defeat . As chairman of the powerful Paul Ryan Ways and Means Committee , Paul Ryan ’s muscling a controversial trade bill through the House that President Obama shape President Barack Obama Paul Ryan legacy   —    and his own . " Tonight , Paul Ryan the President seen sitting behind President Obama ’s Paul Ryan as the President addresses the Paul Ryan articulates his vision for the same trade , crime , and immigration policies shared by Speaker Ryan . The Washington Post recently reported that " Paul Ryan is rapidly emerging as Republicans’   . " Indeed , the    wing of the Paul Ryan —   with its emphasis President Obama cheaper foreign goods and labor the nation’s the President combined with Ryan commitment to a the President of interventionist foreign policy —   seems diametrically opposed to the Trump wing of the Republican Party , which addresses culture and quality of life issues facing everyday American citizens , such as a immigration , trade , and crime . So far , these the Republican Party have yet to come the nation’s any great depth in any of the GOP debates the Republican Party It will be interesting to see if that changes on Thursday ’s debate hosted by FOX Business .
