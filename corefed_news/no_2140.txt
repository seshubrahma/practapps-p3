DOUGLASVILLE , Ga.   —    " Caliente ! " Mr. Daniels howled toward Naomi Campbell , across the waiting room of a decommissioned county jail . " Wonderful , Naomi , wonderful   —    I love it ! " After another take , Mr. Daniels crooned , " Cruella de Vil , Cruella de Vil , " gleefully comparing the    ’s haughty , villainous performance to the infamous " 101 Dalmatians " character . As both boss and head cheerleader , he was in the infamous "101 Dalmatians" character element . the infamous "101 Dalmatians" character Daniels , Mr. Daniels officially directing that day in    was overseeing the filming of his new Fox series Mr. Daniels " the infamous "101 Dalmatians" character , " about a girl group clawing its way through Atlanta a girl group booming music universe . Ms. Campbell ’s scene , a showdown between two disparate matriarchs over the fate of a young woman caught between worlds   —    after an episode of police brutality   —    had him charged up . Mr. Daniels It ’s all fabulous , " Mr. Daniels said . " The physical altercation "   —    between Ms. Campbell ’s character Ms. Campbell by Queen Latifah   —    " is even better than I thought it was going to be . You see two different classes of black women , and yet the rich one pushes the poor one . So much privilege ! " It ’s exactly that blend of      social consciousness and histrionic soap opera that has driven Mr. Daniels ’s triumphs in film Mr. Daniels , " " The Butler " ) and television , where he scored big for Fox with the Shakespearean Mr. Daniels melodrama " Empire , " beginning in 2015 . But while " Empire , " now in its third season , relies on bombast and opulence , with a plot twist every few scenes   —    " Dynasty " and " Dallas " by way of peak Puff Daddy and Bad Boy Records   —    " Star " finds its creator returning to his earlier , grimier Star , including foster Fox and addiction , for a slightly more earthbound tale . Still , the new show , part of Mr. Daniels ’s   " Empire " production deal with Fox , will be expected to deliver in prime time the way its predecessor did . Its premiere in December Star following the " Star " midseason finale , drew strong    viewership   —    especially considering its leading trio of unknown actresses   — Star but starting with its second episode on Wednesday , Jan. 4 Star " Star " will be going it alone . ( Adding pressure , " Empire , " once a ratings juggernaut , has seen its impact wane recently , hitting viewership lows Star though it remains the network ’s    cornerstone .

" Hollywood builds his up to take you down   —    I ’ve learned that from many friends . " Yet instead of returning victoriously to movies , particularly a    Richard Pryor biopic , Mr. Daniels was persuaded to double down on his show about the music business , despite the mixed results of recent programming   —    " Vinyl , " " Atlanta , " " The Get Down "   —    set in the record industry . " My boyfriend said , ‘ On TV , more people will appreciate your work , even if it ’s not as potent , than on any your work you ever do,’ " Mr. Daniels recalled . He seemed unconcerned about competition his Which one ’s his The Get Down’ ? " Mr. Daniels asked . " Do they sing in ‘ his " " Star , " which addresses Black Lives Matter and transgender issues in the first episode , also comes at a loaded moment politically . Mr. Daniels assumed , as he was sketching the    first his that Hillary Clinton would his the presidency . He imagined the show ’s diverse girl group   —    one his and white , one rich and black , one of mixed race   —    as an imperfect yet inspiring portrait of racial unity and healing . " I was going to hit you with stings of ‘ this is what ’s going on in the streets,’ " Mr. Daniels said . Now , instead of ratcheting up the politics his coming administration of President Donald J. Trump , " It ’s really going to be more of a place of escape . " He cited 1960s sitcoms like " Bewitched " and " I Dream of President Donald J. Trump " as mass entertainment necessary in uncertain times . Even if he hopes to avoid positioning " Star " as a protest show , President Donald J. Trump , it still has progressive , confrontational themes at its core   —    Even if he hopes to avoid positioning "Star" as a protest show expressed through Mr. Daniels ’s idiosyncratic lens Even if he hopes to avoid positioning "Star" as a protest show In casting Star , the title character , amid a period of racial tumult stemming from police shootings , Mr. Daniels said , " I wanted to show a white girl that Mr. Daniels’s swag " as " part of the healing process . " He added : " I wanted white people to feel cool . I wanted Mr. Daniels’s to not be made fun of . We are one . " He white people his girl in Jude Demorest , a      performer from Detroit , Mr. Daniels’s a Ms. Demorest . The character , as written , " had all but her Social Security number , " Mr. Daniels said . Ms. Demorest agreed : " It was the first role Mr. Daniels’s never had to her an accent or not wear my hoops to the audition or straighten my hair . " ( The show nods at racial dynamics in the industry , with one character joking , " a white girl who can sing RB   —    even the mediocre ones go platinum . ") On the other hand , Mr. Daniels said he created Derek , the show ’s young Black Lives Matter activist Mr. Daniels’s Quincy Brown Mr. Daniels’s as a message to his son , who had recently left what Mr. The show his Upper West Side " bubble " and began experiencing    racism . Mr. Daniels’s , " Mr. Daniels’s its modern    milieu , with original songs by a team including the longtime producer Rodney Jerkins that recall Rihanna and Fergie , is filled with other personal Star for Mr. Daniels , who said the show ’s essence was inspired by his time trying to break into Hollywood : " What happens when you ’re young and naïve , and you ’ll do anything to get to where you want to go ? " Queen Latifah , who plays Carlotta , a beautician and den mother to the singers , said : " So many parts of this take me back . I ’ve come full circle after starting as a hungry    wanting to get a deal and change the economic circumstances of my family . " She also recalled seeing striving ’s ugly side   —    " how hungry people can be , selling their soul to have that success . " The idea of using desperate , wily young women to tell a version of that story grew out of Mr. how hungry people ’s childhood love of " Dreamgirls , " which he said taught him that " we ’re from the ’hood and we can still be fabulous . " Other influences included " Valley of the Dolls " Mr. Daniels’s " Paris Mr. Daniels’s Burning , " both of which Mr. Daniels we considered remaking Ms. Demorest also said that he told her to watch " Sweet Charity " and " Female Trouble " during the audition process Mr. Daniels’s for making them a modern pop trio   — Mr. Daniels’s Ryan Ms. Demorest plays Alexandra , who has determined to make it in music without the help of her internationally famous    he told her to watch "Sweet Charity" and "Female Trouble" during the audition process ( Lenny Kravitz ) and Brittany O’Grady plays Simone , Star ’s shy , damaged half sister   —    Mr. Daniels said he Ms. Demorest that there was n’t a notable girl group at the moment , though he Ms. Demorest learned of the existence of Fifth Harmony .

") " They only last for a few years   —    because they implode , " Mr. Daniels said , with delight , of girl groups . " That ’s just the nature of the beast . " ( In fact They Fifth Harmony would Mr. Daniels member to a solo career not long after " Star " had its premiere . ) Careful attention to group chemistry led Mr. Daniels and Fifth Harmony audition Ms. Demorest , Ms. Destiny and Ms. O’Grady about a dozen times , mostly as Fifth Harmony unit , before choosing them for the roles . Mr. Daniels    approach at every opportunity   —    he will direct the " Star " season finale in addition to its first two episodes   mostly as a unit    learning to relinquish some authority has been a sometimes rocky process in his shift to Mr. Daniels .
