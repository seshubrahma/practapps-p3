It ’s that time of year for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , which means it ’s also time for the usual      triathlon event . [ Davos is supposed to be a    event about opportunity and technological breakthroughs , but the media coverage favors activist groups that want to seize the spotlight for various forms of socialist theater .   Reuters gets on a nice roll about " inequality " before veering into the    crisis in the Middle East : Politicians and business leaders gathering in the Swiss Alps this week face an increasingly divided world , with the poor falling further behind the    and political fissures in the United States , Europe and the Middle East running deeper than at any time in decades . Just 62 people , 53 of them men , own as much wealth as the poorest half of the entire world population and the richest 1 percent own more than the other 99 percent put together ,    charity Oxfam said on Monday . Significantly , the wealth gap is widening faster than anyone anticipated , with the 1 percent overtaking the rest one year earlier than Oxfam had predicted only a year ago . Rising inequality and a widening trust gap between people and their political Rising inequality and a widening trust gap between people and their political leaders are big challenges for the global elite as they converge Rising inequality and a widening trust gap between people and their political leaders Davos for the annual World Economic Forum , which runs from Jan. 20 to 23 . But the divisions go far beyond those that exist between the haves and   . In the Middle East , the divide between Shi’ites and Sunnis has reached crisis point , with Iran and Saudi Arabia jostling openly for influence in a region reeling from war and the barbarism of Islamic extremists . You know , those Islamic Islamic extremists solution to the " unequal distribution of wealth "   —    kill the people who have what you want and take it . A somewhat    contingent has rediscovered the ancient practice of redistributing wealth by migrating    into someone else ’s homeland . How can anyone on the hard left object to these practices ?   Once we ’ve decided property ownership is up for grabs , and that political power matters more than lawful capitalism , all that remains is to decide what sort of coercive force will be used and whose " entitlements " should take precedence . " Just 62 people , 53 of them men , own as much wealth as the poorest half of the entire world population   …     "   Oh , my God , we ’re into    with billionaires now .   It ’s not fair that only nine of the people who own half the world are women ! Did any of these 62      people the people who own half the world   We never get the people who own half the world allegations , never anything that lines up with the Western ideal of due process , with clearly defined charges and accusers faced .   We just get statistics that supposedly demonstrate We vague offense has been perpetrated against the poor , with demands for the remedial seizure of wealth , skipping all that messy business about a trial and evidence . The very notion that political power can achieve economic " equality " is the biggest lie ever told .   You will find nothing of the sort in any place   —    in this century or previous ones   —    where politicians seize power over production and wealth . Quite the opposite .   The more powerful the State becomes , the more disproportionately wealth a tiny ,    elite gets , while everyone else sinks into poverty and despair . And that    elite does get its riches by stealing them at gunpoint    rather than producing elite selling useful things .   They do n’t react well to having this    strategy pointed out .   The most important difference between " income inequality " under capitalism vs. socialism is that you get severely punished for complaining about it under the latter system . Also socialism Trumpophobia is running wild at Davos this year   —    something Reuters only alludes to , but Bloomberg News makes the headline with " The Specter of Donald Trump Is Haunting Davos . " " The prospect of Davos in the White House is ratcheting up anxiety among the 2 , 500 business and political leaders gathered at the Swiss ski resort for the annual World Economic Forum , " Bloomberg writes . With less than two weeks before voting in primaries gets under way and Trump in the Republican Party lead , those who fear a rise in protectionism and economic mismanagement are speaking out against the billionaire property developer . This is followed from quotes by former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor declaring that a Trump presidency is " a very serious prospect for the world , " former Clinton Administration Treasury advisor Beth    pronouncing it a " disaster , " and Harvard professor Niall Ferguson announcing that he ’s " really looking forward " Harvard professor Niall Ferguson the " wonderful catharsis " of " Trump ’s humiliation . " It ’s hard to top lefty supervillain George Soros popping up to announce that Trump ( and Ted Cruz ) are Trump’s the work of ISIS , " because they " want people to turn against the Trump (and Ted Cruz) community and make the Muslim community think there is no alternative the Muslim community " which " turns the Muslim community into a breeding ground for ISIS . the Muslim community it sounds like ISIS does n’t think much of " moderate Muslims " at all   —    he thinks they ’re all ready to view terrorism as the only Soros to Trump and Cruz !   Will any activists demand he apologize for that ? Then again , Soros went on to Soros about the refugee flood into Europe reaching Soros " tipping point where the influx reduces the capacity of receiving countries assimilate or integrate the refugees and we have a panic , " which has turned Europe into the equivalent of " a cinema on fire without exit Europe , " which sounds   …      kind of like what Trump was saying . Soros should denounce himself for doing the work of ISIS .   Soros then we Soros get on with the world economic forum , and roll out some cool new technology to moon over .
