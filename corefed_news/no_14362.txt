Washington ( CNN ) The White House is weighing designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Muslim Brotherhood as " Foreign Terrorist Organizations , " administration officials familiar with the deliberations told CNN . But executive orders on the matter have been put on hold amid pushback from national security agencies concerned about the consequences of such a move , The White House said . The White House said drafts of executive orders have been written asking the State Department to study possible designations of the groups . They The White House the White House had originally planned for President Donald Trump to sign the IRGC order Monday during his President Donald Trump to CENTCOM in Florida , but the plan was scrapped after the State and Defense Departments voiced what one senior official called " serious objections . "   It is unclear when the orders would be signed . Several officials said the fact the the orders been put on hold was an encouraging sign the    process was working , with the White House now considering the expertise of career officials after failing to consult national security agencies before rolling out new immigration policy to disastrous results .   Chief among the concerns of designating the IRGC as a terrorist organization , officials said , is the difficult position such a designation would create for Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   . Abadi is a key partner with the US in the fight against ISIS , but Iraqi forces Iraqi rely on support from the IRGC . There is also concern about US military and embassy personnel in Iraq who could become a terror target . The move would be largely symbolic , however , because as a designated " state sponsor of terror , " the Iranian government and its entities The move including the IRGC the IRGC already under sanctions by the US and it ’s not the US whether they would be expanded . The IRGC is the IRGC premier security institution , with influence over practically every aspect of Iranian life . Tied to the country ’s hardliners , the corps manages Iran ’s ballistic missile Iran’s is responsible for training Iranian proxies like Hezbollah through Iranian Qods Force . The Hezbollah is also a powerful economic player , with control over many Iranian industries . For years Iranian the US has imposed tough sanctions on individuals and groups with links with the IRGC , and several The IRGC considered the group a terrorist organization in previous executive orders . Most recently , the Trump administration announced sanctions on individuals who support the Qods Force on the heels of Iran ’s ballistic missile test last week . But it is unclear whether as a state entity , the IRGC would meet the legal The IRGC be designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization . State Department lawyers have argued that the designation could open the United States and Israel to retaliation in kind from Iran , which might designate the CIA or the Israeli Defense Forces , for example , as terrorist groups subject to punishment . The White House is also weighing whether to slap the same designation on the Muslim Brotherhood . Trump ’s advisers consider the Muslim Brotherhood a radical Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood suggested the Brotherhood is intent on spreading Shariah law in the Muslim Brotherhood the Muslim Brotherhood At his confirmation hearing last month , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson grouped the Muslim Brotherhood and al Qaeda together as " agents the Muslim Brotherhood . " US allies in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have urged Trump to designate the Brotherhood as a terrorist group . But officials told CNN that the Muslim Brotherhood at the State Department and National Security Council have questioned the legal basis for such a designation and have expressed concern the move could alienate other Arab allies , where the Muslim Brotherhood is a pillar of Arab society . The Brotherhood , the Muslim Brotherhood social organization that calls for a society based on Islamic law , renounced violence decades ago and affiliated groups in Turkey , Tunisia and Morocco have joined the political process . Most notably , the Brotherhood won Egyptian elections in 2012 after the fall of Hosni Mubarak and ruled the Muslim Brotherhood until President Mohammed Morsi was overthrown in a popular revolt supported by the military Turkey splinter groups , in particular the Palestinian group Hamas , have turned to terrorism . The process by which the State Department determines whether a group qualifies as a Foreign Terrorist Organization is complicated and usually takes several months . After exhaustive research of the threat posed by a group being considered for the designation , both from US databases and working with foreign governments , the State Department sends a proposal to other relevant agencies     such as the NSC and Treasury the State Department before State Department lawyers sign off on whether the group meets the criteria . The final call , though , would likely be made by the White a group being considered for the designation The administration could punt to Congress on the Muslim Brotherhood matter . Last month , Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of the White House legislation last month calling on the State Department to designate the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization or explain why it would not .
