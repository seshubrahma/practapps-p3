JERUSALEM   —    A day after approving the construction of a new settlement in the West Bank for the first time in more than 20 years , Israel announced a new , if ambiguous , settlement policy on Friday " out of consideration for the positions of President Trump " and , Israel said , to enable progress in the peace process with Palestinians . Israel said Israel was taking steps to " significantly rein in the footprint " of the settlements , allowing construction within all Israel existing settlements in the occupied West Bank but limiting , " wherever possible , " all its existing settlements in the occupied West Bank expansion into new territory . How the new policy might translate on the ground was largely left open to interpretation . Palestinians , like most of the rest of the world , oppose any Israeli construction in the occupied territories . Saeb Erekat , the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinians’ chief negotiator , furiously rejected the the new policy " All Israeli settlements are illegal , ’’ he said , " Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinians’ chief negotiator we are not going to accept any formula that aims at legitimizing the presence of Israeli colonies on occupied Palestinian land . " Mr. Trump has called for curbs in settlement construction as part of an ambitious push to revive    talks to end the    conflict . In an interview published in February in the Hebrew edition of Israel Hayom , a newspaper considered supportive of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel , Mr. Trump Israel he Mr. Trump " to Mr. Trump reasonably Israel " after a series of Israeli moves to approve thousands of housing units for new settlers . " There is limited remaining territory , " Mr. Trump added . " Mr. Trump you take land for a settlement , less territory remains . " Days later , during a meeting between the two leaders at the White House , Mr. Trump made a public request Mr. Trump off on settlements . But on Friday , the White House gave no signal that the White House by Israel ’s latest settlement move the White House At a White House briefing on Friday , officials said they the White House want to discuss Friday settlement question and officials not anticipate that it would be a focal point of discussions over the the settlement question week . That was despite the fact that on Friday the administration was preparing for separate visits by President Friday Fattah    of Egypt and King Abdullah II of Jordan to the White House next week   —    both leaders of countries often affected by tensions between Palestinians and Israelis . While Mr. Sisi has not yet made Israeli policy toward the Palestinians a major concern , King Abdullah faces a more delicate domestic situation where assertive Israeli actions often generate protests . Worried about a public Israeli , King Abdullah raced to Washington shortly after Mr. Trump took King Abdullah buttonhole the new president at a prayer breakfast and implore him not to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem , as King Abdullah had promised on the campaign trail . Mr. Trump has King Abdullah and delayed any embassy move while he Mr. Trump matter . Since then , Jerusalem and Washington have Mr. Trump to try to reach an understanding on Jerusalem or curbing settlement construction . During the Obama administration , Israel ’s settlement activity was the source of constant friction . Secretary of State John Kerry harshly rebuked Israel in December while vigorously defending a United States decision to abstain Israel a United Nations vote condemning Israel on the settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem . Israel Israel ’s latest policy announcement was likely to have been coordinated with Israel White House . Since the February meeting with Mr. Netanyahu , American and Israeli officials have been working to reach a more formal understanding on slowing or curbing settlement construction . And there appears to be some understanding that Mr. Netanyahu would be allowed to fulfill his earlier promise to compensate 40 families evicted from the illegal hilltop Mr. Netanyahu of Amona by building them a new community . Mr. Netanyahu has been walking a fine 40 families evicted from the illegal hilltop outpost of Amona between the new Trump Mr. Netanyahu with which he wants to remain on good terms , and the right wing of Mr. Netanyahu governing coalition , which has been pressuring him to increase construction and Mr. Netanyahu in particular , to reject any freeze Mr. Netanyahu building in certain areas . The    ministers were silent on Friday . The Yesha Council , the umbrella body representing the roughly 400 , 000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank , expressed cautious optimism but , reflecting the ambiguity of the new policy , said it would be monitoring the Israeli government closely to see if new building the new policy came to fruition . Most of the world considers Israeli settlement activity in the territories captured from Jordan in 1967 to be a violation of international law . Israel considers the territories disputed and says the fate of the settlements must be decided the territories captured from Jordan in 1967 talks . Most informal peace plans have envisaged border adjustments that would allow Israel to retain some of the major settlement blocs , especially those close to Israel 1967 boundaries , under any permanent agreement with the Palestinians , in return for land swaps . The new policy announced on Friday made no explicit distinction between the blocs and the outlying settlements , in deference to the settlement advocates . It said that Israel would continue construction , where possible , within already developed The new policy announced on Friday of the Israel , and where that was not possible , would build adjacent to the last line of construction . In cases where legal , security or topographical constraints made those scenarios impossible , new construction would be kept as close as possible to the existing    areas . The boundaries of jurisdiction of some of the settlements are expansive , extending well beyond the    areas . The new the settlements aimed at preventing the construction of new neighborhoods far away from existing buildings , long a settler tactic new construction of West Bank land . But the new Israeli formula left the government much room for maneuver . While it might limit the territorial expansion of the settlements , it could also encourage an increase in the settler population by , for example , filling in available spaces it    construction and by building more homes closer to existing amenities . " When you build neighborhoods adjacent to the    area it encourages people to come , " said Shaul Arieli , an Israeli expert on political geography who prepared the   area for past negotiations with the Palestinians and Mr. Arieli the settlement blocs would clearly make any eventual Israeli evacuation more difficult . But Mr. Arieli said that for supporters of the    solution the Palestinians were also advantages in the new policy , especially the settlement new construction was mostly concentrated within the settlement , making them denser rather than spreading over a larger geographical area . " The question , " he said , " is where they will build . " Peace Now , an Israeli advocacy group that opposes and monitors settlement construction , said the blocs definition of " inside a settlement " could be quite flexible in the eyes Mr. Arieli the settlers and the Israeli government , with " settlers looking to exploit the loopholes " in order to expand . " It is this argument over lines , " the group said in a statement , " that has led past U. S. administrations into the trap of seemingly endless and irresolvable negotiations over how to decide what it means to build ‘ inside’ settlements . " Under the pretense of an Israeli advocacy group that opposes and monitors settlement construction and while trying to fool the international community , it said , the " Israeli government has drafted a policy that will allow it to continue and expand settlements without any limitations .
