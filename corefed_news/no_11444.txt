"   Marlow said , " Yeah the media coverage of Donald Trump is —   let ’s talk about this latest issue where he Donald Trump the KKK . He Donald Trump been disavowing David Duke since the year 2000 . And he Donald Trump going to have to , because of the CNN Jake Tapper video , he Donald Trump going to have to answer to that through the general , assuming he Donald Trump the nomination . I would like to ask NBC if , when he Donald Trump the number one show in prime time TV , if they the number one show in prime time TV he Donald Trump some sort of KKK guy ? He Donald Trump some sort of Grand Wizard KKK aligned affiliate . How about all the thousands and thousands of people who worked for the KKK guy This is all media hysteria that has been created to target Donald Trump . It is This that he Donald Trump a bigot , it is that the media has always crafted this narrative . " " We saw this with Mitt Romney , who is mostly a scandal free guy , " he Donald Trump . " They tried Mitt Romney, who is mostly a scandal free guy pin Todd Akin on him Donald Trump the very end . Barack Obama ’s campaign accused him Donald Trump murder because someone died of cancer . The media creates scandals around Republicans . That is what they have The media done They found The media David Duke thing dates back to before he was David Duke mainstream reality TV star in America ’s living rooms everyday , so it ’s this David Duke thing a fair attack . This is media bigotry and I just encourage people to look at his position David Duke what he stands David Duke , and what he has David Duke his whole David Duke , and not buy the media spin . Make up your own mind . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
