Washington ( CNN ) A Democratic senator from Michigan said Monday public pressure may have swayed enough of A Democratic senator from Michigan Republican colleagues to bring down the nomination of Betsy DeVos for education secretary . " We may , in fact , have an additional Republican colleague voting ’no,’ which would stop A Democratic senator from Michigan tomorrow , " Sen. Debbie Stabenow told CNN ’s Erin Burnett " OutFront " Monday . Last week , Republican Sens . Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski said Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski would not vote for DeVos .   If all other Republicans vote in favor of DeVos , DeVos’ nomination will pass the Senate with Vice President Mike Pence casting a    vote . That would be the first time the vice president had broken a tie for a Cabinet pick in history . But if DeVos’ opposition can peel off more Republicans , DeVos will not become education secretary . Republicans have said Republicans are confident Republicans have the votes .   Democratic senators have steadfastly opposed to DeVos’ confirmation , and earlier Monday Democratic senators began a    long debate against DeVos on the Senate floor . DeVos has faced significant pushback , from DeVos controversial advocacy of charter school programs to accusations of plagiarism . Stabenow said the Democrats’ united front against DeVos has " galvanized " people and caused some Republicans to declare some Republicans intentions not to support President Donald Trump ’s pick . But Stabenow acknowledged Stabenow party ’s weak position . " We know as Democrats We do n’t have the votes to stop these nominations by We , but people     parents , teachers , administrators , community leaders across the country     have power and are weighing in . " As for who else would join people    parents, teachers, administrators, community leaders across the country     , Stabenow demurred . " I think there are a couple of folks still thinking about it , " Stabenow said . " We do n’t know . "
