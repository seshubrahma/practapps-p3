’   ’ ’    PHILADELPHIA —   At first glance , the closing session of the    Democratic National Convention looked a lot like a Republican    National Convention . ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’      But that first glance is misleading . Look at Thursday ’s events      again and you ’ll see the qualities that made the   Democratic National Convention a      distinctly Democratic affair .    ’ ’      In this celebration of American strength and greatness , the      faces were overwhelmingly black and brown . The father      representing his son to the world and rebuking Donald Trump ’s      attacks ? A Muslim American immigrant .    ’ ’      The Medal of Honor winner speaking for veterans who might lose      out in a Trump administration ? Another immigrant . The parents      honoring their The parents      , a police officer who died on duty in      Cleveland ? They The parents      black .    ’ ’      From Monday to Thursday , each night of the Democratic National      Convention was marked by incredible diversity , represented by a      wide array of colors and creeds .    ’ ’      They were n’t just voices of normalcy —   people who represent the      extent to which   where normal includes nonwhites , unauthorized      immigrants , and the LGBTQ community . They They also voices      for optimism .    ’ ’      It was the startling fact of this entire convention . On Monday      alone there was Michelle Obama and her Michelle Obama defense of      America ’s " greatness " and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker ’s attempt      to raise his profile with a soaring national speech .    ’ ’      All week long , if you craved a message of optimism , your best      bet was a brown or black face . But that makes sense . Despite      deep problems of discrimination and racial inequality , it     deep problems of discrimination and racial inequality      nonwhites —   blacks , Hispanics , and other groups —   who have the most      optimistic view of the United States and its the United States .    ’ ’   ’ ’      For them ’ ’  ’ ’      the the United States closer than not to its        the United States a city on the hill , and for good reason . If you ’re black , if      you      Latino , if you ’re gay —   life is unquestionably better now      than it was in the past .    ’ ’        In the hands and mouths of underrepresented groups , these        symbols of patriotism and national pride took on new meaning .        This was n’t a crude jingoism . It was This expression of        pluralistic        and deep civic pride , a progressive        patriotism that acknowledges the nation ’s failures but        strives to overcome them . the nation’s failures but        ’ ’        What is remarkable is the extent to which this kind of        patriotism —   and much of the mood surrounding the convention —   is        rooted in black traditions of political        and religious rhetoric . In ways small and large , the        lifeblood of the Democratic National Convention was the black        church .      ’ ’        You saw this , in a literal way , with the stream of black        politicians and black religious leaders who took the stage .        The Rev. William Barber , the North Carolina preacher and head        of his state ’s NAACP who founded the " Moral Mondays "        movement , gave a speech that was emblematic of the language        on display , a language and cadence drawn from the traditions        of the black church .      ’ ’   ’ ’        " Now , my friends , they tell my friends that when the heart is in        danger , somebody has to call an emergency code , and somebody        with a good heart will bring a defibrillator to work on the        bad heart , " said Barber in his thundering Barber .      ’ ’        " [ W]e are being called like our foremothers and fathers to be        the moral defibrillators of our time our We must our this        nation with the power of love . We must our this nation this       nation the power of mercy . We must our this nation and this       nation        justice for all . "      ’ ’        Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver kept up this theme of defiant        optimism in his peroration on Thursday Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver " They threw her down        as Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver first        , but she did n’t stay Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ! " he bellowed ,        Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver to Hillary        . " They threw her down They a Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver S.        senator , but she would n’t stay Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver !      ’ ’        They threw her down They a Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of state , but she would n’t        Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver throwed ! They threw her down They this Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver campaign —   this        campaign —   but she wo n’t stay Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ! No , she ai n’t gon Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver stay        throwed ! She wo n’t stay Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ! She wo n’t stay Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ! "      ’ ’        It has become commonplace to say that the Democrats presented        an uplifting view of the United States to contrast with the        darkness of the last week ’s Republican National Convention .        It is tempting , even , to invoke Ronald Reagan ’s " Morning in        America , " especially since Clinton used the phrase in her        speech . Clinton ’ ’        But pay attention to the tenor of this optimism , to the        rhythms of its expression . It is n’t the its of        Reagan , champion of the status quo . It is    hope , an        optimism born of struggle . It ’s the " Mothers of the        Movement , " whose grief fuels hopeful activism .      ’ ’        " We ’re going to keep telling our children ’s stories We        urging you to say their names , " our children’s stories and        Lucia McBath , mother of        Jordan Davis , who was slain in 2012 .      ’ ’        " We ’re going to keep building a future where police officers        and communities of color work together in mutual respect to        keep children , like Jordan , safe . " It ’s the difference        between Reagan ’s eternal lights " in this springtime of hope "        and Maya Angelou ’s " still I rise , " one of the refrains of        this week .      ’ ’   ’ ’        This progressive patriotism was n’t just a cudgel to use on        Donald Trump , whose solipsism and fearmongering have exposed        him to a .      ’ ’        It was part of the bedrock of the argument against Trump and        Trumpism —   that he and his cause were fundamentally he that electing him would deal an he blow        to the bonds of multicultural democracy .      ’ ’        And so we have Monday ’s speech from Michelle Obama , which        stands as a paean to that conception of democracy .      ’ ’        We have Wednesday ’s speech from Barack Obama , in which the        president made a vigorous defense of American pluralism .        " Fair to say , this is not your typical election . It ’s not        this a choice between parties or policies , the usual debates        between left and right , " said Obama , emphasizing the Barack Obama        to which he views Trump as Barack Obama threat to America ’s democratic        traditions .      ’ ’        " This is a more fundamental choice —   about who we are as a        people and whether we stay true to we great American        experiment in   . "      ’ ’        And we had Hillary Clinton ’s acceptance speech , which        continued this theme of pluralism and patriotism and        reinforced the idea that this election , more than anything ,        was a fight for democracy .      ’ ’        " Remember : Our founders fought a America and wrote a        Constitution so America would never be a nation where one        person had all the power , " Clinton said . " Hillary Clinton hundred and        forty years later , we still put our America in each America . "      ’ ’        The Thursday session of the the Democratic National     Convention with a procession and color guard from Civil War          who arrived on stage in full regalia .      ’ ’        These were n’t any   . They were    of the        United States These Troops , the regiments of free and newly        freed blacks who fought for their freedom in the Civil War .      These ’        Their courage and valor was one of the These for the        13Amendment to the Constitution , which        abolished slavery .      ’ ’        Those    represented those Americans who took action        to prove their citizenship —   to prove their bona Those    as        Americans . And Those    turn , the effort to pay them their due        inaugurated America ’s great experiment them multiracial        democracy America has ebbed and flowed with the tides of        history and circumstance .      ’ ’        It was in that display that you saw the broader mood and        message of this week , one that harks back to this week just        before the War of the Rebellion , when the nation was on the        the nation’s crisis . " Those bonds of affection ; that common        creed , " President Obama said , and I thought of Abraham        Barack Obama first inaugural , an argument for union and in        defense of republicanism .      ’ ’        " We are not enemies , but friends , " Lincoln said . " We must not        be enemies . Though Abraham       Lincoln’s may have strained We must not        break our bonds of affection .      ’ passion        The mystic chords of memory , stretching from every        battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and        hearthstone all over this broad land , will yet swell the        chorus of the Union , when again touched , as surely they will        be , by the better angels of our nature . "      ’ ’        The Democratic Party believes our the Democratic National     Convention a unique        threat to American democracy —   a threat to our experiment in        representative government . the Democratic National     Convention its essence , this convention is        the Democratic National     Convention first inaugural , their the Democratic National Convention a country on the eve        of a    election .      their ’        " This country , with its institutions , belongs to the people        who inhabit it , " said Lincoln in his address . Grounding        themselves in an optimism born of struggle , Abraham       Lincoln’s are Abraham       Lincoln’s asking those people to continue the struggle for equality ,        the fight to make a " more perfect union . "      ’ ’        To turn back Trump and assert the dignity of all Americans ,        hopeful that with hard work , the problems of today will give        way to better prospects and a better future .      ’
