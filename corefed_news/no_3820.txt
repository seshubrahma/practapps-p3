Former FBI director James Comey began Former FBI director James Comey testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by suggesting that the question of whether President Donald Trump had committed obstruction of justice was one for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate . [ But under questioning by Sen. James Risch ( ) Comey all but destroyed any hope Democrats had for bringing a case of obstruction of justice against President Donald Trump .   Their exchange was as follows : Risch : Sen. James Risch ( ) want to drill right down , as my time is limited , to the most recent    regarding , allegations that the President of the United States obstructed justice . And , boy , you nailed this down on page page five , paragraph three , you put this in quotes . Words matter , you wrote down the words so we can all have the words in front of us now we There ’s 28 words that are in quotes , and it says 28 words that are in quotes quote : " I hope "   —    this is the president speaking   —    " I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go , to letting Flynn go . He is Flynn good guy . I hope you can let this go . " Now , those are his exact Flynn is that correct ? Comey : Correct . Risch : And you wrote them here those you put them in those . Comey : Comey . Correct : Risch you for that . He did Risch direct you to let it go that Comey : Not in his words Risch no . Risch : He did Risch order you to let it go . Comey : Comey , those words are not in order . Risch : No . He said Comey " I hope . " Now , like me , Comey probably did hundreds of cases , maybe thousands of cases , charging people with criminal offenses . And of course you have knowledge of the thousands of cases out there where people have been charged . Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice or for that matter any other criminal offense where they said or thought they hoped they an outcome ? Comey : I do n’t know well enough to answer . And the reason I keep saying his words Comey , I took it as his words direction . Risch : Right . Comey : Comey mean , it ’s his words President of the United States with me alone Comey saying , " I hope this . " I took it as this is this he wants the President of the United States to do . I did n’t obey that , but that ’s the way I took it . this : You may have taken it as this direction , but that ’s not what he said Risch Comey : Comey . Risch : He said Risch " I hope . " Comey : Comey are exact words , correct . Risch : You do n’t know of anyone that ’s been charged for hoping something ? Comey : Comey do n’t , as I sit here . Risch : Risch you , Mr. Chairman . Democrats have hinged their hopes Democrats impeachment   —    and reversing the 2016 elections   —    on the idea that Trump committed obstruction of justice . That case has now been smashed beyond repair . Joel B. Pollak is Senior     at Breitbart News . He was Joel B. Pollak one of the " most influential " people in news media in 2016 . He is Joel B.
