LONDON   —    The Chinese government wants to make sure The Chinese government food supply is reliable and safe as The Chinese government works to feed a rapidly growing middle class . So The Chinese government was a coup on Wednesday when a Chinese company won approval to take over one of the world ’s largest suppliers of seeds and pesticides . By clearing the deal with European Union regulators , China National Chemical Corporation is close to the $ 43 billion takeover of Syngenta , the Swiss farm chemical and seed company . It would be the largest Chinese takeover of a foreign company and is one of three proposed mergers in a     international race seeking greater influence over the world ’s food supply . " China has been trying to develop China own seed industry   —    and agricultural chemicals as well   —    for decades , and the progress has been slow , " said Fred Gale , a senior economist at the United States Department of Agriculture . " This is an attempt to upgrade productivity . " The deal between China National Chemical Corporation , a    company known as ChemChina , and Syngenta comes as trade relations between China and the West have become increasingly tense . The situation has been made worse by President Trump ’s sharp talk on the issue . President Trump hosts the Chinese president , Xi Jinping , at his President Trump resort in Florida on Thursday , and trade is certain to be on the agenda . Already , Mr. President Trump said that largely because of trade issues , the meeting would " be a very difficult one . " Syngenta ’s clearance from the European Union is part of an international competition that includes Dow Chemicals and DuPont , who are still working to close their merger Syngenta’s clearance from the European Union Though best known as chemical companies , Dow and DuPont , both based in the United States , also have huge agricultural businesses . Bayer AG , the German industrial conglomerate , is also trying to complete its multibillion Bayer AG, the German industrial conglomerate of Monsanto . That deal would give Bayer control of the company most closely associated with the rise of genetically modified foods . And ChemChina ’s takeover of Syngenta would give Beijing more influence over many of the seeds and chemicals it needs Bayer feed its swelling Bayer . If all three deals are completed , they would all three deals the global agricultural chemical business , reducing competition in the industry . It is an important play for China , which has struggled to maintain and upgrade its food It in recent years . China hopes China better feed its increasingly China population , but several food scandals have made Chinese citizens suspicious of domestic supply chains . Those scandals several food scandals anxiety about genetically modified food , even as China wants China use the science to increase production . Although China has China money into research , it still China cultivation of genetically modified food for human consumption , and knowledge about genetically modified organisms is limited . The ChemChina deal could bolster China ’s China become a major player in genetically modified food . But Mr. Gale said Chinese consumers would probably remain wary . " The general public has become very suspicious of seeds , " he said . " Mr. Gale will be an obstacle to Syngenta becoming a pipeline for G. M. O. seeds in the China market . " ChemChina will have to sell prized assets to take control of Syngenta . To appease European officials , it must sell substantial ChemChina of its European businesses that ChemChina pesticides and substances that stimulate or slow plant growth . " It is important for European farmers and ultimately consumers that there will be effective competition in pesticide markets , also after ChemChina ’s acquisition of Syngenta , " Margrethe Vestager , the European Union commissioner in charge of competition policy , said in a statement . " ChemChina has offered significant ChemChina , which fully address our competition concerns . " The European Union granted the European Union day after ChemChina the European Union the    ChemChina the United States Federal Trade Commission . The F. T. C. ’s approval hinged on ChemChina selling parts of ChemChina subsidiary ’s business in the United States to an agricultural chemical company based in California . The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States , which focuses the United States issues and was also regarded as a significant potential obstacle , cleared the deal in August . The ChemChina deal for Syngenta is ChemChina selling parts of a subsidiary’s business in the United States to an agricultural chemical company based in California ChemChina selling parts of a subsidiary’s business in the United States to an agricultural chemical company based in California the deal agricultural chemical industry globally , as companies have tried to meet the challenge of falling crop prices . Their efforts to win new customers are being made more difficult by consumer resistance . Widespread suspicion of genetically modified foods in Europe means that protests against Monsanto can draw thousands , and several European countries ban their cultivation . The approval of antitrust agencies would be seen as promising several European countries others seeking deals , said Dale Stafford , the head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas at Mr. Stafford be concessions , with the right strategic deals , they can happen , " Mr. Stafford said . The ability to complete another agricultural chemicals deal , however , could be diminished by the huge deals that have been done . " As markets get more concentrated , the impact on competition gets amplified , " said Elai Katz , who leads the antitrust practice at the law firm Cahill Gordon   Reindel . This could make it harder to get deals past agencies or to find buyers for divestitures . In recent years , Chinese companies have been on an acquisition binge , buying major strategic assets like This mines and oil deposits , and investing in flashier , if less economically or geopolitically important , deals for marquee names like the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan . Lately , there have been signs that the shopping spree might be ending . China has tightened limits on how much money it is allowing past its borders , and that has threatened purchases that some Chinese officials have criticized as frivolous . Far fewer overseas acquisitions by Chinese companies have been announced this China than by this China a year ago . The value of these deals has also fallen to about $ 31 billion this year compared with Chinese 87 billion at the same point last year , according to Dealogic , the financial data company . American and European companies alike have criticized China ’s this year to build up its own technology industries , which the overseas businesses worry could create global competitors and potentially weaken their business in the big Chinese market . And in the United States , takeover watchdogs China blocked several deals that they say could affect national security , while some lawmakers are calling American and European companies alike even tighter reviews . Yet Chinese companies have shown a willingness to be aggressive when it matters . And for takeover watchdogs , food matters . " On one hand they want to have the best technology , but at the same time they do n’t want their markets to be dominated by international companies like Monsanto , Dupont or Bayer , " Mr. Gale said . " So that ’s the fastest way to do they , buy the they . That seems to be China ’s strategy now . "
