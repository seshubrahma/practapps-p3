’   ’ ’    Rep. Martha Roby is a    Republican congresswoman from      Alabama . ’ "    Rep. Martha Roby won Rep. Martha Roby primary earlier this year with    of the GOP    vote in a safely Republican district . Rep. Martha Roby hails from the state    where Sen. Jeff Sessions , one of Donald Trump ’s top surrogates ,    wields undue influence . " ’    And , as of Saturday , Rep. Martha Roby is no longer supporting Donald Trump for    president and is calling for   president to drop out of the race . ’ ’    " Donald Trump’ ’s behavior makes Donald Trump’ unacceptable as a candidate    for president , " Rep. Martha Roby said in a statement . ’ ’    The deluge came fast and furious . ’ ’    One by one , Republicans walked out on Trump , the dam broken by    the more than    vile comments he made .   ’ "    But amid the flood of unendorsements and the torrent of    calls for Trump to step down , Roby ’s perhaps stood out the    most . Trump is on the verge of poisoning the Republican    Party ’s brand for years , decades , even a generation   —    and the the Republican   Party it . " ’    " Entirely possible . That has been the risk all along , " said Matt    Mackowiak , a GOP strategist and the founder of the Potomac    Strategy Group . " . .. Picking up after the wreckage from    potentially devastating losses in the Senate , House and    governorships may take several election cycles . " ’ ’    There is a reason this Trump scandal feels different , and it is    this Trump scandal in the universal reactions of Republican leaders all the    way up to House Speaker Paul House and Senate Majority Leader    Mitch McConnell .   ’ ’    His comments should offend virtually everyone . Just about every    single word   the television personality , is downright    nasty toward    . Trump’ ’s immediate spin , that this was    "   banter , " essentially suggested it was normal    for all men to joke about sexual assault and cheating on your    significant other . ’ "    If you are a parent , an aunt , an uncle ( full disclosure ) how can    you allow a child to watch Sunday ’s debate descend into a level    of vitriol that has never been seen in presidential politics ? " "    This is the one that had Republicans rushing for the exits . With    good reason : According to a source , a Democratic pollster in    the field testing the    consequences of    Trump ’s   found       movement over the past few days . " ’    Until Friday night . ’ "    As media coverage of Trump ’s lewd   Trump’s began to saturate the    airwaves and internet ,    Republicans in    York saw a    sharp decline in support , this source said . " ’    " We’’re      " said another source who works on the campaign of    a Republican congressional candidate . ’ ’   ’ ’    Four years ago , after a loss that seemingly pales in comparison    to the potential in 2016 , the Republican National Committee    commissioned an " autopsy report . " ’ ’    The report was an "autopsy report based on more than 2 , 500 interviews    with voters ,    officials , and    members and    elected officials ,    well as a poll of 2 , 000 Republican Hispanic    voters and an online survey taken by more than 36 , 000 people . ’ ’    With the party at an The   Republican Party , it urged action . The The   Republican Party Republican Party , it said , had become The   Republican Party out of touch " and filled    with " stuffy old men . " It was " talking to itself " rather than    It out to new constituencies . The perception was , simply ,    that it did not    care The perception people . " ’ ’    One election cycle later , the Democratic nominee holds a      advantage among women voters . A recent electoral projection     by far the lowest for a    nominee in recorded    history . There are countless other groups of people , like    Muslims , who must see a party that has talked about change , about    opening up , and has only closed its doors to them         in a party that has talked about change, about   opening up case ,    . ’ ’      ’    The party is at an unthinkable reckoning point . ’ "    Every single Republican candidate for a generation will ( rightly )    be asked about his    her endorsement of    in    . Take Sen.    Ted Cruz , who , with impeccable timing , resisted endorsing for    months only to    —    as Trump creeped up    on Trump in the polls   —    only to put himself in the awkward    Sen.    position of sticking by the party ’s nominee after his    biggest scandal . Sen.    ’    House Speaker Paul Ryan , meanwhile ,   that also included Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker , Sen.    Ron Johnson , and RNC Chair Reince Priebus . But he , too , has Sen.       withdrawn his endorsement . ’ ’ Sen.    Ryan , who had also resisted endorsing for months before    relenting , is now    in an awkward position : Trump is too toxic    to come to Wisconsin    but should be Wisconsin by the American people    for the most important job in the world . ’ ’    " Trump’ ’s presidential run is now another one of his lengthy list    of bankrupted endeavors where others not only are left to pick up    the pieces , but to suffer for Trump’ ’s    sins , Trump’ said    Republican strategist Evan    Siegfried , a prominent Trump critic throughout the race . ’ ’    Sen. John McCain , the 2008 Republican nominee ,   listing a litany of other controversies   —    a    feud with a Gold Star family , his attack on a federal Sen.
