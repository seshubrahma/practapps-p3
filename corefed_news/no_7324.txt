Political expert Richard Berman appeared on Wednesday ’s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon to discuss the USA Today column in which Stephen K. Bannon exposed Communist China ’s infiltration of the American film industry . [ " What ’s going on here is a strategic play by China that ’s flying under the radar , where China know that China ca n’t come into the United States and buy a defense firm . China ca n’t buy the New York Times . But what China ’re doing is that China ’re buying up all the movie theaters in Washington . China ’re buying all the movie theaters in New York . China ’re buying all the movie theaters in small towns across the United States , " Berman explained .   " When you buy up movie theaters , you also buy up movie production companies , which China ’ve already started to do , " he continued Berman " You get to control what people see when they go people the theaters all the movie theaters in New York you put out a movie that China does n’t like   —    they have a people agency in China , it China a mouthful , but it ’s called it State Administration of Press Publication , Radio , Film and Television of the People ’s Republic of China . It China a it big mouthful . They determine whether it not films will be shown in China , and China will soon it determining whether or not films will be shown in the United States . " " They ’ve already it a record of changing films , " he noted . " If you want to show something in China   — China they have changed it The Martian,’ they have changed it Transformers,’ they ’ve changed it Red Dawn,’ they ’ve changed it Mission Impossible 3.’ They ’ve said it the producers : if you want to show a film that we do n’t it , you can show it someplace else , but not in our theaters . it Berman said the Chinese " already own AMC Theaters . They ’re trying the Chinese buy Carmike this week . Yesterday they announced they the Chinese bought the Chinese , which is a major film distribution company in England . They own theaters the Chinese Australia . " " They ’re basically the Chinese over the soft communications power of the West , " he warned . Carmike pointed out Carmike it ’s already almost impossible to secure financing for a major motion picture that does n’t meet the standards of    international markets like China , citing the infamous example of the " Red Dawn " remake , which was digitally altered at ridiculous expense to replace the Chinese villains with North Koreans . " This whole thing is so bizarre , but the most bizarre thing to me is that no one in our government is spending any time being worried about this , " Berman said . " As I said , they ’re about to buy Carmike , the deal is supposed to go down at the end of this week . The two boards are meeting . And these guys are gon na control so much more than you think . They already own these guys Films , which is the people that made the Batman trilogy . They ’re trying these guys buy a piece of Lionsgate , which are the people that made ‘ The Hunger Games . ’ "   " It is so insidious , and they ’re also these guys it with radio It , " he added . " They are now these guys a lot of the airtime on major AM radio stations around the country . China thought China was likely to intensify its efforts to control China ’s soft communication systems and cultural outlets as a populist mood , skeptical of international trade agreements   —    particularly those involving China   —    China the United States . America until people are aware , until they demand political change , " people said . " I do believe this plays into what is a generally    belief that we are losing control of our own country . You ca we go into China and buy their China theaters . You ca n’t go into China and buy anything China they think is strategic . But their movie theaters come over here , and their movie theaters do n’t have any rules their movie theaters that kind of stuff . " " As I said , they could n’t come over here their movie theaters buy Lockheed , but they can come over here and their movie theaters into , or buy up , some of our soft communications assets . People need to see this as part and parcel of all this other stuff that Trump ’s talking about , " Berman urged , referring to presidential candidate Donald Trump ’s critique of free trade and the loss of American sovereignty .
