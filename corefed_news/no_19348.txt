’   ’ ’    Presidential elections in America are typically seen as a binary    choice between two    candidates   —    currently , Donald    Trump and Hillary Clinton . ’ ’    But the 2016 election brings the potential of a spoiler   —    and    Republicans have taken notice . ’ ’    If independent candidate Evan McMullin , a former Republican    congressional policy leader who just entered the race three    months ago as the " Never Trump " candidate , wins the "Never Trump" candidate home state of    Utah , it’ ’s possible that neither Trump nor Clinton would reach    the requisite 270 electoral votes to win the presidency . ’ ’    McMullin   in Utah , but just    weeks ago ,   between McMullin , Trump , and    Clinton , a notable feat considering that Utah is a reliably      state . ’ "    McMullin ’s popularity in Utah is also striking considering    the fact that ,   only 52 % of voters said only 52% of voters were aware    enough of McMullin candidacy to offer an opinion on McMullin . And of those    who are aware of McMullin , four out of five say those   who are aware of him view McMullin    favorably . " ’    Trump is aware of the problem . Trump attacked McMullin    last week and noted that Trump campaign could have a " major    problem " if McMullin    threatens McMullin    in Utah . ’ ’    " The guy takes votes away from me , " Trump last last week " You know , we’’re going to win Utah . Utah    he takes    away from me , me man who I never heard of .    .    Now , if for some reason we lose Utah that Utah have a    very    impact on the overall . " ’ ’    Other prominent conservative voices have also bashed McMullin in    recent    . ’ ’    Conservative commentators Laura Ingraham and Lou Dobbs have    attacked    on McMullin : ’ ’ ’ " ’t’t’tLook Deeper , He ’s McMullin but a Globalist , Romney and Mormon Mafia Tool        " ’ ’ " ’t’t’tBlame the   folks ( Romney ? Romney for pushing McMullin in Utah . Voters wo n’t forget .   " ’    And Sean Hannity , a Fox News host and Trump loyalist , went off on    McMullin McMullin in Utah radio show McMullin in Utah week . ’ ’    " Who’ ’s this idiot that’ ’s running third party that’ ’s killing Trump    out Trump , " Utah said . " Who put him up ? What Trump it ? The    Bush people ? The Romney people ? " ’ ’    If McMullin managed to McMullin in Utah off a win in Utah , he Utah be McMullin in Utah first    candidate outside of the Democratic and Republican parties to win    a state in a presidential election since 1968 . ’ ’    And his campaign views Republican ’ ’    as a sign of    Republican panic . ’ ’    " ’ ’    has major internal and organizational    issues both in Utah and beyond , " McMullin campaign manager Joel    Searby told Business Insider in an email . " Everyone    acknowledges that . And now Evan and our movement are offering a    viable conservative alternative . So I believe they feel    threatened . " Evan and our movement ’    Still , his only shot at the presidency    to win Utah , block    Trump and Clinton from reaching the set number of electoral votes    they need , and then hoping electoral votes    once the decision goes to the    House of Representatives , they could pick him for the electoral votes    . ’       the presidency website FiveThirtyEight   at 1 % to 3 % and    his   at 12 % .    ’    In interviews with Business Insider , some Republicans    shrugged off the threat that McMullin could pose to Trump . ’ ’    " Two new polls came out today that show he ’s in the low 20s at McMullin best , " said Sean Spicer , communications director for the Spicer the    media fascination with this . There is no evidence that he is    within single digits in McMullin state , and yet it garners national    news . It is embarrassing for the press . " ’ ’    he is   within single digits in a state referred to McMullin as a he is   within single digits in a state   independent candidate "    and said there is " no evidence to suggest " that talk of him    winning Utah is " anything more than a bunch of folks in the    media McMullin " ’ ’    But even if victory seems somewhat unlikely for McMullin , voters    in conservative , religious Utah appear reluctant to support a    Republican nominee McMullin candidacy has been mired by scandal . Utah ’    " I think a lot of people in Utah have significant moral    sensibilities , " said Ben Carson , a prominent Trump surrogate and Utah former Republican presidential candidate . " And , you know , when    you look at some of the things that Donald Trump has said , you    remember , this is a guy who was a billionaire playboy . So the    sensibilities    going to be quite different I think than your    average Iowa citizen . " ’ ’    In one recent scandal , Trump was recorded making lewd    comments about women . The recording , from 2005 , was Donald Trump last    month . One poll showed that 94 % of Utahns had watched or    heard about the recording , and 51 % said they believe Trump should    drop out of the race altogether . ’ ’    Carson cautioned 51% against Donald Trump a " protest vote " against    Trump on Election Day . ’ ’ Utahns " I’’ve been so impressed with the intelligence and the common    sense of the people in Utah , " he said . " And I think when push    comes to shove , they will recognize I’’ve ’s going on and how    taking a    in a situation that    a    situation like with    Evan McMullin    make a lot of sense . " ’ ’    In the days leading up to the election , McMullin will be    traveling across the state in an effort to consolidate support . ’
