’   ’ ’    Globalization has been one of the dominant economic trends for    over 100 years . Expanding free trade and increasing the flow of    goods , services , and people from country to country has been a      invincible force since the late 19th century . ’ ’    According to George Saravelos and Robin Winkler , strategists at    Deutsche Bank , the era of expanded globalization is over and    . ’ "    While we ’ve written about the     before , George Saravelos and Robin Winkler made an interesting comparison to    the last time the US attempted to stem the tide of globalization . " ’    Saravelos and George Saravelos and Robin Winkler there was a time before the    election of Donald Trump that a Republican came into office , with    both houses of Congress on his side , calling for the protection    of the American economy . From the note : ’ "    This led some of the US ’s biggest trade partners to also raise    their tariffs against American goods in retaliation . Furthermore ,    limits on capital flows and movement of people also put a drag on    economic growth . The end result contributed to the disaster of    the Great Depression . " ’    " As a result , US trade halved within years , and global trade    weakened even more , even if it continued at low    within    regional trading blocs such as the Commonwealth and the remnants    of the Gold Bloc , " the note said . " The rise in protectionism    served as an important catalyst to the global recession . " ’ ’    Many of the protectionist moves made by Hoover are echoed in the    suggestions of    Trump today . Several analysts have    noted that the large trade partners Trump has threatened with   Trump tariffs   —     and    —    could also retaliate with their own tariffs . the large trade partners Trump has threatened with   tariffs  —    and   —    ’    In fact , the Chinese government has threatened some measures such    as   if Trump goes through      Trump his policies . Additionally   Trump Trump wants to stem   Trump flow of    immigrants into the US , which could be a negative labor supply    shock . ’ ’   ’ ’    Saravelos and Winkler also noted that this issue was exacerbated    in the 1930s by developments in Europe . ’ ’    " Flows in capital and people further declined in the early 1930s    as a wave of populist political movements spread through Europe , "    Europe the note . ’ ’ have been aiming to restrict the    flow of immigrants and pull back from the European single market .    And the   is a concrete example of    such a move    ’ ’    Saravelos and Winkler say that drawing a historical comparison is    " not intended to argue for a repetition of history but to    highlight how a    of events led to the unraveling of    global trade .    ’ "    There are also some caveats here . For one , Trump ’s proposals are    not as severe as the policies Hoover put in place . And economies    and people are already far more connected than they were in the economies   and people late 1920s . " ’    While the strategists did not predict any sort of calamity from    this trend and Trump’ ’s policies , they said they " the strategists that the strategists global growth will be helped , " and noted there could be serious    problems with the    of the policies . ’
