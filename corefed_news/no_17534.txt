Washington ( CNN ) Ohio Gov. John Kasich burst onto the Republican playing field Tuesday with a freewheeling and , at times , emotional speech that hit on two main points : Americans should be working together and Ohio Gov. John Kasich can win , despite long odds . Ohio Gov. John Kasich told his life story Ohio Gov. John Kasich 45 minutes Tuesday at his Tuesday mater Ohio Gov. John Kasich Ohio State University . And it was 20 minutes into his speech , Ohio Gov. John Kasich times meandering and sounding unscripted , before he made it Ohio Gov. John Kasich : his speech I am here to ask you for your prayers , for your support . .. because I have decided to run for president of the United States , " Kasich told the crowd of roughly 4 , 000 . Kasich tacked to Kasich left throughout his speech , Kasich way that no other Republican candidate has this cycle , touching on themes of unity and support .   " There are those who say ’Just work harder.’ ’Pull yourselves up by your bootstraps.’ I believe in all of that . Some people just do n’t have the fortune we have , " he said . Later Kasich his speech , Kasich Kasich who has been criticized heavily for expanding Medicaid under the President Barack Obama ’s signature health care law     asked for empathy .   " The Lord wants our hearts to reach we to those who do n’t have what we have , " we said . " Kasich should n’t be hard for America , that ’s we we are . Empathy we Do n’t be so quick too judge . " As he becomes the 16th Kasich Republican candidate to enter the field , Kasich faces an immediate hurdle of trying to make it onstage for the first Republican debate . Fox News has said only the top 10 candidates in national polling will make the cut and Kasich has been trailing Kasich the back of the pack with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal . Kasich hinted at his Kasich in a Kasich throughout his speech , laying Kasich the argument for why he could upend the Kasich in the    field . " They said it could n’t be done , and we proved them wrong They " They said , as Kasich recounted his first Kasich for Kasich , then his 2010 run for Kasich . Though he waited until Tuesday Kasich announce , the Kasich campaign has effectively Kasich up and running for months . His affiliated campaign group Kasich New Day for America , began airing its second television ad His affiliated campaign group, New Day for America New Hampshire this week . He blasted his way Kasich late Kasich June with the first major buy of the cycle , spending $ 1 . 7 million to introduce himself to New Hampshire Kasich . New Hampshire as he formalized his bid Kasich minutes Kasich his speech Tuesday , Kasich will be looking to ride the    bump into the top 10 candidates     the group that will be able to participate in the first GOP debate next month sponsored by Fox Next . The     Republican has a resume    for presidential politics : elected twice statewide in battleground Ohio , worked in the private sector and served nearly two decades in Congress , which included a    run as chairman of the House Budget Committee . Why Donald Trump is surging in the polls , Kasich launches his presidential campaign near the Donald Trump of the pack in the polls . A    the polls in July showed the Ohio Republican with just 2 % support among likely GOP primary voters . And the latest average tallied by RealClearPolitics has Kasich at 1 . 5 % Kasich , and in 12th place , just behind former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former U. S. Sen. Rick Santorum .   His candidacy offers mainstream Republicans another former U. S. Sen. Rick Santorum alongside former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio . As Florida looks to differentiate himself , former U. S. Sen. Rick Santorum calling card may former U. S. Sen. Rick Santorum up former U. S. Sen. Rick Santorum his blunt and sometimes prickly style former U. S. Sen. Rick Santorum which could be spun to present a    candidate , ready to break out of typical molds . Kasich previously sought the presidency 16 years ago , but withdrew from the race in July 1999 and endorsed George W. Bush . During that campaign he referred to himself as the Kasich Jolt Cola Kasich of the Republican field to draw a contrast between his lively personality and what he Kasich as less exciting candidates Kasich This time , however , he said he ’s staffed up Kasich ready Kasich run .   " I ’ve done this before . The problem was last time that I had this jet airplane ready to take off but I did n’t have any gas for it . It never got into this jet airplane air this jet airplane " Kasich said earlier this month , following a meeting of Washington backers he convened near the Capitol . Kasich I learned a lot from that . "   More than a      later , Kasich is still full of energy Kasich and is not shy about taking on his fellow Republicans : He has Kasich Medicaid expansion under Kasich Affordable Care Act , supports Common Core education standards and has allowed for the possibility of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants .   The Ohio ’formula’ That        style has helped raise Kasich ’s political stock , at least in Ohio . The Republican scored a The Ohio ’formula’ victory in his 2014    fight , receiving The Republican % of the vote and winning all but two of the Buckeye State ’s 88 counties , albeit against a flawed Democratic challenger . That 2014 victory was even more remarkable considering Kasich ’s standing just a few Kasich’s . Shortly after taking office , Kasich pushed to end the collective Kasich rights for public employee unions in the state , a bruising battle that saw his approval ratings dip into the Kasich . In November 2011 , Ohio voters rejected the measure at the ballot by a    margin , 61 % to 39 % . " It ’s clear the people have spoken , " Kasich said in the aftermath of Kasich defeat . " I heard their voices . I understand their decision the people And frankly , I the people what the people have to say in an the people this . And as a result of that , it requires me to take a deep breath and to spend some time to reflect on what happened here . " Perry and Trump trade shots over border security , Less than two years later , Kasich took a step that would roil some conservatives , announcing in February of 2013 that Ohio would accept federal money under President Obama ’s health care law to dramatically expand Medicaid coverage to some 275 , 000 residents . The decision resulted in a    fight with GOP state lawmakers , but Kasich ultimately prevailed in an effort that he Kasich framed as both an economic and Kasich cause . " I ’m proud of what we ’ve been doing for the people who have been living in the shadows , living under a bridge or whatever , " Kasich said during a Republican Governors Association panel Kasich November . " And the people have responded to it . Conservatives in my state have responded a Republican Governors Association panel it by and large . " The effort a Republican Governors Association panel not appear to have any lingering effects by the time November 2014 rolled around , with 88 % of conservatives saying they backed Kasich for a second term , according to Kasich polls . But it was Kasich ’s ability to expand his support among Kasich that Republicans have struggled Kasich’s win over at the national level , winning 60 % of women , 59 % of moderates and 26 % of   . Kasich suggests other Republicans should be following his Kasich if they want to take back Kasich White House other Republicans year . " I think it ’s a formula for the country . they want to take back the White House next year at problems and fix them . Do n’t be worried about the problems election , " Kasich told CNN ’s Gloria Borger during a Kasich to South Carolina in February . " I mean , too many politicians worry about getting elected as they do their job     if they worried too many politicians about too many politicians their job they too many politicians get elected . His too many politicians brand too many politicians conservatism , No Republican Gloria Borger waged a successful campaign for the White House without winning Ohio . And there is one thing Kasich says will not work with Buckeye State voters : extremism . " If somebody comes into Ohio and they ’re extreme , they ’re Ohio going to win , " they told CNN . " I mean , Kasich do n’t operate that way in Ohio they " Walker pushes back on    Ohio , That has been a common refrain for Kasich as he explored a potential presidential bid Kasich this Kasich . During a March appearance in New Hampshire Kasich blasted " New Hampshire divisions in America " Kasich said we should " cross their own interest groups and reach out to unite leaders lift Americans . " The challenge for Kasich , though , is selling a more pragmatic Kasich of politics to a conservative GOP primary electorate eager to draw sharp contrasts with President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , the likely Democratic nominee in 2016 . Kasich has an answer Kasich for critics who contend his approach to governing Kasich not line up with conservative principles . " You know what , I ’ve got as much a right as anybody in the Republican Party to define what conservatism means , " Kasich told CNN in Kasich . " I was the governor CNN Ohio February took an $ 8 billion hole and Ohio a surplus . We ’ve cut taxes more than anybody in the country , and they ’re wondering about my the country Maybe I should the governor of Ohio that took an $8 billion hole and produced a surplus about theirs . " ’Crusade’ to balance the budget , There the governor of Ohio that took an $8 billion hole and produced a surplus one policy area where it is hard to deny Kasich ’s conservative chops : the budget . Kasich’s Kasich of the country has been a focus of the Ohio Republican for the country Kasich the Ohio Republican Kasich " Kasich Ohio " of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 , signed by President Bill Clinton , which resulted in the first federal budget surplus since the late 1960s . Last December , fresh off his 2014    victory Kasich Kasich launched what he Kasich a " Kasich " to adopt a balanced budget amendment to the U. S. Constitution , which included travel to the key early voting states of South Carolina and New Hampshire , as well as New Hampshire as Idaho and Utah South Carolina If you do n’t manage the debt , it ’ll kill you , " Kasich said during a Kasich stop in New Hampshire , the debt to " travel New Hampshire America " to promote America agenda . An Kasich for Kasich , When he was mulling a bid earlier this year , Kasich said Kasich one of Kasich key factors in his decision would be whether Kasich was a way for him to win the Kasich House . Amid a field of    contenders     Kasich Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott the White House looks crowded out George W. Bush However , his affiliated " New Day " group Kasich combined fundraising haul of $ 11 . 5 million during a Gov. Scott Walker    Kasich period starting from May 1 , enough for the Kasich team to land in the middle of the pack . And Kasich has the Kasich of a handful of key Republicans , including top media strategists Kasich Sen. John McCain ’s 2008 bid , Fred Davis and John Weaver , and former New Hampshire Sen. John Sununu , something Kasich often New Hampshire .   " Give me somebody better than John Sununu in New Kasich , tell me who it is , " New Hampshire earlier this month . " I ca n’t figure out who it would be . Kasich ( former ) Gov. ( John ) Sununu , his father . But I ’ll take young John . "
