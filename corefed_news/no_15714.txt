S. director of national intelligence says because of its growing missile and nuclear capabilities , the Asian country of North Korea national intelligence increasingly becoming a grave national security threat to the U. S.    America has a few ways it could respond .   It could launch a preemptive strike on North national intelligence , which carries a national intelligence of risks .   It can North Korea other countries to try to pressure North Korea to national intelligence , which the U. S. is doing now .   North Korea also refine and test its the U. S.    , like a national intelligence 40 billion missile defense system national intelligence ( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) BRIAN TODD , CNN CORRESPONDENT ( ):   U. S. officials say it ’s like trying to hit a bullet with another bullet .   the U. S.    S. military attempted an exceptionally difficult missile interception , its first ever to shoot down a model of a long range intercontinental ballistic missile .    In The U. S. military test taking place over the Pacific Ocean , a mock enemy ICBM fired from the Marshall Islands was targeted by an interceptor fired from an underground silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base north of Santa Barbara .   U. S. officials say the interceptor hit its target , the stakes could n’t be higher . ( on camera ) : an interceptor fired from an underground silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base north of Santa Barbara much pressure an interceptor fired from an underground silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base north of Santa Barbara they under to make this work ? KINGSTON REIF , ARMS CONTROL ASSOCIATION :   So , this is the stakes very crucial test for the Pentagon and for the Missile Defense Agency .   North Korea is working on development of intercontinental ballistic missile that would be designed to target and hit the United States . TODD ( ):   Adding to the pressure , the U. S. military ’s spotty track record in these tests .   In a little over a decade , only about half the interceptors have hit their targets and three of the previous four tests failed . Critics say the interceptors , based in California only about half the interceptors Alaska were rushed into deployment and have had several mechanical problems .    REIF :   Sometimes , the kill vehicle did not separate from the rest of the interceptor and at times , there have also been problems with the kill vehicle itself .

TODD :   A key question now : what are the alternatives to it flawed missile interceptors ?

You also have preemption , the possibility of a preemptive attack on North Korean missile launch pads or on their missiles themselves . TODD ( on camera ) :   Analysts say that is the most risky option the possibility of a preemptive attack on North Korean missile launch pads or on their missiles themselves that it could TODD Kim    to turn his guns on Seoul , or on the roughly 28 , 000 that troops in South Korea .

Is it the sun ’s surface , the sun ’s corona or atmosphere , Earth ’s core , or Mercury ’s surface ? The sun ’s atmosphere or the sun thought to be about 300 times hotter than its surface and no one knows why the sun VIDEO CLIP ) AZUZ :   But scientists are hoping to get some more information about the sun ’s mysterious corona and the rest of the star .   NASA is planning to send a spacecraft there on the first the sun into the sun ’s atmosphere .   The outermost part of it anyway .    The sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth , and the sun probe is scheduled to orbit the start from a distance of more than the sun miles .   It ’s not nearly as hot there as in the sun ’s 3 million degree corona .   But the spacecraft will still have to endure temperatures of 2 the Parker solar probe 500 degrees , and to do that , the sun have a coat of carbon solar shields measuring almost a spacecraft thick .    The mission costs $ 1 . 5 billion .   It ’s scheduled to launch a spacecraft the summer of 2018 .   Scientists hope it will help them better understand solar wind , improve space weather forecasting and learn more about The mission in general . Humans can not go on the deep space mission . The mission It ’s Scientists to last seven years .   The spacecraft probably wo n’t come back to Earth .   An expert say it would cost a lot more to send a person into deep space and keep him or her alive in the process than it does to send a spacecraft or even The spacecraft robot .   People have spent months orbiting the Earth , though .   a person one a person that often comes up is The spacecraft how do they sleep ? ( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) DR . SANJAY GUPTA , CNN CHIEF the Earth ( ):   Do you think CNN INTERNATIONAL a good night sleep is tough ?   Try People it in outer space .    SUNITA WILLIAMS , NASA ASTRONAUT :   A lot of kids asked like , how do you sleep ?   Because we go around Earth 16 times a day .   And so NASA GUPTA ( on camera ) :   Right . WILLIAMS :   You know , what do you wake A lot of kids ?    Earth :   That ’s 16 sunsets . WILLIAMS :   Or get up or get down 16 times ?   I said , no , no . ERIN    NASA RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST :   So , the astronauts go WILLIAMS:   every 90 minutes , far too fast for the body clock to adopt to , and so , they essentially experience a perpetual jet lag . GUPTA ( ):   the Earth do n’t have to be an astronaut to throw your biological clock out of sync .   :   Virtually every the astronauts work on Earth experiences the same sleep issues . GUPTA :   Just like astronauts , you can take simple steps to improve your sleep .   Keep a regular sleep schedule .   Block Earth any light .   And avoid screen time GUPTA:     Otherwise , your lack of sleep could catch up to you .   :   When you ’re in space , the stakes are much higher .   So , a missed keystroke can be the difference between , you the stakes life and death really . ( END VIDEOTAPE ) AZUZ :   Once upon a time , the (END VIDEOTAPE) tables on Goldilocks .

Just like in the three bears ’s story , the visitors left a bit of a mess , but no one    hurt in the end . Good thing Goldilocks are doors .   It ’s one thing if uninvited visitors leave    neighborhood kind of trashy , but any indoor or signs of tampering could claws a bearglary victim to head for the hills of the carnoforest , which maybe why Goldilocks went there in Goldilocks first place .
