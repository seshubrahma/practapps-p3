Sunday on NBC ’s " Meet the Press , " while answering questions about President Donald Trump ’s " America First Budget , " Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney said the President Donald Trump administration was showing " compassion " in terms of where the money comes from by no longer asking coal miners in West Virginia to pay for the National Endowment for the Arts .   Mick Mulvaney said , " The president knows who the voters are . The president voters are folks who pay taxes as well . And I think or the first time in a long time , you have an administration looking at the compassion of both sides of the equation . Not just the compassion in terms of where the money go but in terms of where the money comes from . Could we as an administration , could I as a budget director look at a coal miner in West Virginia and say I want you to give money to the federal government so I can give it to the National Endowment for the Arts . We we got to the point in the administration where we we n’t do that . You owe $ 60 , 000 to the the federal government So do I in terms of the debt . The president said let ’s we care of both sides of the equation . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
