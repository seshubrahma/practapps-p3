The petition calling for the we College to be eliminated does not explain the Electors that monumental task is the Electors be Hillary Clinton However , there is a separate movement titled the National Popular Vote , or NPV , which would guarantee the presidency to the winner of the popular vote without ratifying the Constitution and without the full agreement of every state . The movement ’s website explains : The U. S. Constitution ( Article II , Section 1 ) gives the states exclusive control over awarding their electoral votes : " Each State shall appoint , in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a Number of Electors   the states     . " The     rule was used by only three states in 1789 . The National Popular Vote interstate compact would not take effect until enacted by states possessing a majority of the electoral votes —   that is , enough to elect a President ( 270 of 538 ) . Under the compact , the winner would be the candidate who received the most popular votes from all 50 states ( and DC ) on Election The National Popular Vote interstate compact When the Electoral College meets in    the national popular vote winner would receive all of the electoral votes of the enacting states . I previously reported on the NPV scheme : The NPV campaign seeks to obtain the consent of the majority of the 538 votes in the Electoral College to award electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote instead of the winner of the popular vote in each state the Electoral College New York , other states that already signed up are the heavily blue states of Hawaii , Illinois , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Jersey , Washington , Vermont , California and Rhode Island . The District of Columbia also has joined the pact . The states will not be required to award their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner until the NPV has signed up enough states to garner 270 electoral votes .    …     The Founding The states firmly rejected a purely popular vote to elect the president , because they wanted to balance the power of the larger and smaller states . The Electoral College was fashioned as a compromise between an election of the president by The Founding Fathers popular vote and election by Congress . Now the NPV effort could change the way Americans elect the president without amending the U. S. the president The plan simply requires that enough states join through votes in the NPV legislatures along with gubernatorial approval . It takes    of both the House and Senate to pass a constitutional amendment to repeal the Electoral College . To bypass enough states constitutional amendment process , NPV minimizes The plan number of states that would need to agree . Instead , once enough states agree to allot its electoral votes to the national popular vote winner , the Electoral College becomes irrelevant .
