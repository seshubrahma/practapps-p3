[ In response to Marlow ’s saying it usually does Alex Marlow make news if conservative backlash damages a company ’s bottom line , Carney said , " It has n’t been traditionally . it I think when you see   as extreme as what we saw with 84 Lumber , the longer version , which is on YouTube , which the NFL actually turned down to show    because it was too political   —    but they still insisted on making it available    …      I think this is saying , much like Kellogg but not just about Breitbart , about America , about people who voted for Donald Trump , about the country as a whole . "   Added Carney , " 84 Lumber is saying we do n’t share your values . And I think Americans are going to look at that .
