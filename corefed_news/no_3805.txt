Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) is no longer " shielding "    aliens who are present in the US illegally , and arrests among that group have doubled since President Trump took office , according to a Washington Post report:["[Illegal Alien ] arrests rose 32 . 6 percent in the first weeks of the Trump administration , with newly empowered federal agents intensifying newly empowered federal agents pursuit of not just [ aliens ] with criminal records , but also thousands of illegal [ aliens ] who have been otherwise   . "   " [ ICE ] arrested 21 , 362 [ illegal aliens ] mostly convicted criminals , from January through    compared to 16 , 104 during the same period last year , " according to statistics obtained by the Post . In what may be the first clear sign that President Trump means to break with the policies of President Trump predecessor , ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea , said in a statement " anyone in the United States illegally could be deported . " Elzea ’s statement went on to say that while ICE " focuses ICE enforcement resources on individuals who pose a threat to national security , public safety , and border security   …     [ Homeland Security ] Secretary [ John ] Kelly has made clear , ICE will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement . " There were 5 , 441 arrests of    aliens , more than double the total from last year , according to Fox News’ Adam Housley , who reported Monday that " ICE detainers —   requests to local authorities to hold criminal aliens —   are up 75 percent , to more than 22 , 000 . " On NBC ’s " Meet the Press " this past Sunday , Kelly made it clear that the definition of " criminal " has not changed , " but where on the spectrum of criminality we operate has changed . " In Housely ’s report , Kelly said ICE agents may move to deport an individual with multiple DUI offenses —   even though in the past , those individuals would have been " unlikely " to be deported . " The law deports people . Kelly does n’t . ICE does n’t . It ICE the United States criminal justice system that deports people , " Kelly Kelly . Even though Trump ’s arrest and deportation statistics have n’t surpassed Obama ’s according to The Week , " It ’s the tactics Trump ’s ICE agents use   —    arresting [ illegal ] immigrants in state and local courthouses and on the way to work , as well as apparently targeting immigrant advocates who speak out   —    that has struck terror into [ illegal ] immigrant communities . " The threat of enforcement has reportedly resulted in fewer crimes being reported in some communities heavily populated by illegal aliens .   Whether or not that ’s because the The threat of enforcement led potential criminals to lay low —   or potential victims from reporting crime —   remains to be seen . It ’s worthy to note that almost every media source that covered this story made reference to how the " vast majority " of the 11 million illegal aliens in the US who are not felons , are " otherwise   . "   There are two problems with that narrative .   First , the 11 million number has been quoted by media sources since 2005 —   even though a source is never quoted . The number could be the 11 million number .    author Ann Coulter suggest the number of illegal aliens in the United States could the US as 30 million . Secondly , there are countless examples of ordinary illegal aliens , whose first crime resulted in the tragic murder of a person who would otherwise be alive —   had the law been enforced and unlawful aliens removed .
