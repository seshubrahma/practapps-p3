During Dr. Ben Carson appearance on Friday ’s Breitbart News Daily , Dr. Ben Carson said it was " not terribly surprising to see the focus on racism and divisiveness " in various issues of the day , notably law enforcement and police shootings . [ " I would encourage people to read a little book , it ’s not that long , called Rules for Radicals , by Saul Alinsky , and you can see how the playbook works , and what people need to do . it ’s to stir up strife , and to stir up division , and discontentment , as opposed to focusing on the real issues , " Saul Alinsky told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow .    " What you must recognize is that people ’ve been working on this for decades . And people just need one more term . That ’s all people need to culminate people efforts , so people can get control of the Supreme Court , and the federal court system . After people have that control , that control does n’t matter who the President is , " Carson warned . With so much at stake , the President anticipated the 2016 election would be " a real     " fight , in which " there will be no tactic that will not be used . " Carson pointed to Detroit , where Donald Trump is scheduled to give a major interview this weekend , as a perfect example of progressive devastation . " It was once the most prosperous city in America , and from there has gone on to become the biggest bankruptcy , after decades of progressive leadership , " Carson mused .   " That should tell anybody   —    Democrat , Republican , independent   —    that there ’s something wrong with the course that ’s been staked out on , and that you really need to stop and do something different . You know , the definition of insanity is doing the same thing , and expecting a different result . We ’ve got to stop being insane , and start exercising common sense , " Carson urged .
