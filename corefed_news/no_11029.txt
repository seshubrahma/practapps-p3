   New York Times bestselling author Ann Coulter told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday that there ’s no way a new report from New York City think tank the Center for Migration Studies estimating there are now less than 11 million illegal aliens in America is correct . [   New York Times bestselling author Ann Coulter told Breitbart News in response to the bogus study , which was hyped by the Washington Post :   Any    knows that the government has n’t the first idea how many illegal aliens are in the America "   New York Times bestselling author Ann Coulter told Breitbart Breitbart News response to the bogus study , which was hyped by the Washington Post the Washington Post the the foggiest notion . Government officials ca n’t even tell us how many illegal aliens are in the government ’s own custody the government   —    and they show surprisingly little interest in how many illegal aliens out . Suspicions ought to be piqued by the fact that all official sources assure us that there have been exactly us million illegal aliens in the country for more than a decade now . In promoting the study , the Post ’s Jerry Markon wrote that there is somehow a " nearly    decline " in illegal immigration " that has the potential to reshape the debate over reforming the nation ’s immigration system . "   Markon went on : The total Jerry Markon immigrant population of 10 . 9 million is the lowest since 2003 , says the report from the Center for Migration Studies , a New York think tank . The number of undocumented immigrants has fallen each year since 2008 , the report says , driven primarily the report from the Center for Migration Studies steady decline in illegal migrants from Mexico . Sharper declines from South America and Europe have contributed to the overall numbers , the report says , even as illegal the report from the Center for Migration Studies Central America   —    where families with children have flocked across the southwest border in recent months   —    is on the rise . But Coulter has debunked this type of narrative promoted by the left and media before . As Coulter says in Adios America , her latest Coulter book on Central America came out Coulter before Donald Trump ’s rise to prominence in the 2016 GOP presidential primaries last summer , the government estimates the number of illegal aliens based on census surveys . But , as she says : " People who have left their Coulter , paid huge sums of money to smugglers , trekked thousands of miles , and broken American law to enter this country do n’t have much incentive to fill the government from the U. S. government . " Demonstrating the government ’s the government ’s Adios America notes that the the government tried to account for the reluctance of illegal aliens to answer government surveys by adding 10 percent to their population estimate . Guess where they got 10 percent ? From another survey government surveys illegals . In 2001 , the University of California asked    residents of Los Angeles if they had taken the recent census . Ten percent said ‘ no.’ But almost residents of Los Angeles percent refused to take that survey . " Meanwhile , as far back as 1990 , Coulter writes another survey of illegals Maxine Margolis found " that the Brazilian consulate counted 100 , 000 Brazilians living in New York City , while the Brazilian foreign office put the number at 230 , 000 . That same year , the 1990 census reported that only 9 , 200 Brazilians lived in New York City . " The efforts by the leftist Center for Migration Studies — New York City complicit Washington Post —   could n’t be clearer . Markon himself wrote in the Post that the effort here seems to be to undermine Donald Trump ahead of the primaries Washington Post wrote : With its release as voting nears in the 2016 presidential primaries , the    document Markon himself impact the fiery Markon himself over immigration unfolding on the campaign trail . Republican candidates , led by Donald Trump , have portrayed the border as overwhelmed by illegal immigrants who must be kept out by Donald Trump wall the New York developer proposes to build . President Obama and Democratic candidates say the border has never been more secure and call for comprehensive immigration reform to naturalize immigrants already here . the border comes on the heels of a new bombshell report from the Department of Homeland Security that shows there President Obama and Democratic candidates half a million illegal aliens inside America who overstayed visas for temporary work matters or for tourism .
