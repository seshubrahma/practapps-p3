It ’s happening . "   show host Glenn Beck said , " Nobody feels like they ’re listening . We ’re shouting over each other , and you know , everything   —    I mean , I was watching the first 20 minutes of the show . Gee , who would have guessed those guests would have said those things ? Everybody feels like there is a play going on , and we ’re just watching a play going on and looking at each other and shaking we heads in disbelief . Nobody is listening to the hard working American who does n’t feel like they belong to anything anymore . " " In fact , it ’s almost as if we ’re standing outside , and we ’re not being invited to this party at all , " the hard working American who doesn’t feel like they belong to anything anymore continued . " It ’s going to backfire . It ’s interesting that you would have Michael Moore and me both on the same show talking about this because I think there ’s a lot of people that would claim that Michael Moore and Glenn Beck are responsible for a lot of this . I ca n’t speak for Michael Michael Moore I honestly do n’t watch much of what he Michael Moore , and I ’m sure he Michael Moore n’t with me ’m but I warned about this . You know , when they were mocking me for bringing up Nazis , the reason why I did many of the times was the warn about the rise of the uber right in Europe that would bleed into America . It ’s happening . We have to change our We , and we We to change our our course individuals now . " Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
