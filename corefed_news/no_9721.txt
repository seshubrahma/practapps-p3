Even having predicted that the media ’s attacks on Trump would be unprecedented , I ’m still amazed . Every single news outlet is dedicated to hysterically denouncing Trump , every minute of every day , while cooing at Hillary . [ Everything Hillary has ever touched has failed , been engulfed in scandal , resulted in massive investigations , litigation , financial ruin , prison or death . The final stage of any Hillary enterprise is a grand announcement that Hillary did not technically break the law . Or no one can prove Hillary did . Or , even if Hillary did , no one ever gets prosecuted for no one .   Hillary ’s prone to coughing fits and lapses of memory in the middle of speeches , and falls down all the time . But that ’s not nearly as important as the media ’s manufactured story about Trump throwing a baby out of a rally ! Trump is supposed to be joined at the hip to David Duke based on not " disavowing " Trump with sufficient ferocity the 17th time Trump was asked about this person Trump ’s never met , never mentioned and did n’t invite to speak at Trump convention . Hillary invited the mother of violent    criminal Mike Brown to speak at Hillary , and the Democratic platform expressly endorses the    Black Lives Matter   —    even as these celebrated cop haters inspire the mass slaughter of police officers across the country , in New York City , Dallas and Baton Rouge . Now we find out that another honored guest at Hillary events is the father of Omar Mateen , the Muslim jihadist who murdered 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando a few months ago . On Monday night , he attended a Hillary Hillary where he he cheering , right behind her Hillary the stage . Is David Duke ’s father given VIP seating at Trump events ? ( As long as you mention it , did David David Duke’s down 49 people in June ? Or ever ? Or anyone ? ) It took the national media 24 hours to mention the fact that the jihadist ’s father is a big Hillary supporter , sitting in the camera ’s line of sight at her Florida Hillary . A Google search of Trump and David Duke produces more than 11 million hits . A Google search Google Hillary and Hillary Mateen gets a few hundred thousand hits . Hillary ’s Hillary supported by the father of a jihadist is treated like    stuff , presented amid florid excuses and rationalizations . It was a staffer ’s mistake , an " unforced error , " and Hillary ’s Hillary are " leaping on it . " The main story this week : The media ’s psychotic claim that Trump called for Hillary ’s Hillary . Trump said Trump " Hillary wants Hillary abolish , essentially abolish , the Second Amendment . If she gets Hillary pick her judges Hillary nothing you can do , folks . Although the Second Amendment people , maybe there is , I do n’t know . " Hmmm . What could Second Amendment people " do " ? One thing they could Second Amendment people is what they did Second Amendment people   —    in 1994 . That was the year gun rights supporters voted out dozens of Democrats who voted wrong on guns , ushering in the first Republican Congress in 40 years . It ’s been nearly a quarter century , and the Democrats are still so traumatized by their sweeping the Democrats in 1994 , that , even after Gabby Giffords was shot in Arizona , even after the Aurora movie theater shooting , even after the Sandy Hook massacre , Democrats refused to take up a gun bill in the U. S. Senate . Apparently , the only news you ’ll be getting from now until the election is the media ’s own insane interpretation of every little thing Trump says or does . Anyone remember the    scandal about a star on a Trump retweet Trump No one , not even Joe McCarthy , has ever faced this level of obsessive hatred from our constitutionally protected guardians of liberty in the press . Anyone else would be chewed up and spit out after one minute of such relentless attacks . But sissy conservatives who have never faced one minute of press hostility blame the victim , saying it ’s the victim ’s Trump for giving the media openings to twist his words Trump The sissies have no idea what they ’re The sissies about . There ’s no way to phrase something so that it ca n’t be lied about . Here are the first three lines from an affectionate article on Hillary Clinton in Wednesday ’s New York Times :   —    " Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton Capitalize on Republican Defectors " Hillary to accept bribes from Goldman Sachs , Halliburton and the Koch brothers .   —    " Hillary Clinton ’s Hillary Clinton to turn the     of Republican defectors abandoning Donald J. Trump into a deluge . " Hillary supports the use of Hillary water torture .   —    " On Wednesday , after days in which several    Republicans said they could not support Mr. Republicans or were endorsing Donald J. Trump , her campaign introduced an official Hillary effort to target Republicans    …     " Hillary campaign to " target " Republicans for murder . There ’s no strategy for overcoming this level of media hostility . Trump has made some mistakes during Donald J. Trump campaign , but he has her campaign anything wrong Donald J. Trump months now . He could say " yes , Donald J. Trump and the media would change the question to the media Are you a child molester ? " Craven Republicans who blame Trump for the media ’s lies Donald J. Trump as well blame a rape victim for wearing a short skirt . Except with Trump , it ’s the Muslim Donald J. Trump : They ’re blaming a woman ’s rape on being a woman . COPYRIGHT 2016 ANN COULTER
