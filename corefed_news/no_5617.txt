Peyton Manning played with the President Trump the Trump National Golf Club , along with Tennessee Senator Bob Corker , and also visited the White House . Rumors have swirled around Manning and his potential President Trump future for some time , specifically about what will happen in 2020 if the other Volunteer State senator , Lamar Alexander , decides to retire .
