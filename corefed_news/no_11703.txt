On today ’s program of Breitbart News Daily , Donald Trump ’s Senior Policy Adviser , Stephen Miller , shared Donald Trump    publicly discussed insights into Marco Rubio ’s duplicitous conduct during Donald Trump’s push to get the Gang of Eight bill through the Senate . [ At that time , Miller served as the communications director for the man who organized opposition to Eight bill , Senator Jeff Sessions . Miller Miller how throughout the Gang of Eight push , Sen. Rubio " directly deceived " immigration law enforcement and the American people .   Miller Miller one story in particular about Rubio ’s treatment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) union president Chris Crane , who represents thousands of ICE officers . At the time , Crane slammed Rubio Rubio having " directly misled law enforcement . " In his Miller testimony , Crane Crane , " Never before have I seen such contempt for law enforcement officers as what I ’ve seen from the Gang of Eight . " For the first time ever , Stephen Miller explained exactly what Rubio Rubio to Chris Crane how he had Stephen Miller the nation ’s ICE officers . During the Gang of Eight press conference to introduce the bill , Crane had Crane to ask a question . Miller explains Stephen Miller Rubio Rubio as Chuck Schumer repeatedly refused to allow Crane to Crane his question Chuck Schumer and Rubio Rubio oversaw Crane being Crane from the press conference by Capitol Hill security . Miller said Stephen Miller Rubio Rubio    …      refused to meet with ICE officers throughout the process [ of crafting the bill ] even as he was   …      with open border special interests . At the very end , he [   …      Rubio had an    meeting with [ Chris Crane ] the representative for ICE officers , in which he made   …      series of promises , every single one of which he broke   …      violated directly    …      When that same ICE officer and Marine went to a press conference to ask a question , Rubio   —    through his silence Rubio   —    was complicit in Schumer blocking [ Crane ] from asking a question and allowing him to   …      the indignity of being forced out of a press conference room   —    a man who had served his country   …      uniform , as a U. S. Marine   —    all to spare Rubio from the discomfort of being publicly questioned about why he had   …      his promises   …      Rubio saw Rubio [ Capitol Hill security ] take Chris Crane and remove him from Chris Crane room and said nothing . When he [ Rubio ] Rubio a chance to show an iota of independence , one scrap of independence from Chuck Schumer , and side with an American Marine and ICE officer   —    Rubio chose to stand           with Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer an American Marine was forced to suffer the indignity of being removed from Marco Rubio ’s Gang of Eight press conference . That ’s the story I want to tell today . Miller ’s retelling of the event is as follows : I would love to tell a story for the first time to your incredible listening audience that I think gives some important insight into Mr. Rubio that Marco Rubio’s never had a chance to tell before   …      I want everyone to step into a time machine and go back to 2013 and remember what it was like . Remember the    media frenzy . Remember the promises : enforcement first , no welfare , no food stamps , we ’re going to have the strongest , toughest border security ever , and , of course , no amnesty —    all of these claims , by the way , which are still on Mr. Rubio ’s website   …      And of course all of those claims were bogus : it gave welfare , it gave food stamps it there was no border security , there was no ‘ border security first’   …      But one of the things that we noticed early on in the process was that Mr. Rubio ’s Gang Mr. Rubio’s meeting with all of the open borders special interests in America : whether it be the Chamber of Commerce , whether it be certain tech corporations , whether it be    groups like La it , etc . etc . or the White House , which had an office in the Senate to help push through the Gang of Eight bill , a fact that Mr. Rubio never mentions in his many interviews on Fox and Mr. Rubio promoting the bill . So we said Eight bill Let ’s get in touch with we law we and see if maybe Mr. Rubio would be willing to meet Mr. Rubio So we got in touch with one of the we incredible men that deals with immigration   …      his name is Chris Crane . Miller explained Miller when Crane was finally able to secure a meeting Chris Crane Mr. Rubio , " Crane had wanted to Mr. Rubio [ a staffer Chris Crane Sen. Sessions office ] who could provide some additional legislative support in the meeting   …      [ however ] Rubio ’s office , of course , vetoed that completely   …      The meeting , as Chris Crane described it to the meeting   was fairly Chris Crane " Crane said the meeting   he said to Rubio , ‘ Well Chris Crane you know Chris Crane under your bill criminal aliens ‘ legalized.’ And Rubio would say [ in response ] ‘ Oh no , Rubio , no , that ’s the not the case at all.’ And then [ Crane ] said , ‘ Well , under your bill Chris Crane is n’t any resources or support for ICE.’ [ To which ] Rubio said , ‘ Oh , do n’t worry , we ’ll Rubio that in ‘ . We ’ll give you , ICE , whatever you need . You we get it , you ’ll get it , you ’ll get it.’ And so Crane said that he it a commitment from Rubio to put Chris Crane in the Chris Crane that Crane felt that ICE Rubio needed . And instead what happened Chris Crane —    only a period of hours later —    instead of doing anything that he had promised Chris Crane —    a marine , ICE Chris Crane —    Chris Crane would do . In the dead of night , Rubio and Chris Crane Gang of Eight introduced a bill delivering everything they wanted for the special interests . Now a short time after that Rubio and the Gang of Eight Rubio , Chuck Schumer and the rest of the Gang of Eight held a press conference . I decided to go the Gang of Eight to go to watch the press conference and see what was happening . And so they did this magisterial roll a press conference of the supporters of the Gang of Eight bill were up there and the Senators were up there and everyone was slapping each other on the back , and it was ‘ Morning in America’ is here again . Chris Crane , who had just been deceived directly by Mr. Rubio , decided that he wanted to ask a question at the press conference . As a citizen , as a marine Mr. Rubio as an ICE officer , as a representative of 7 , 000 other ICE officers , agents and frontline personnel , he said , ‘ I ’d like to ask a question at the press conference.’ And I was Mr. Rubio next to him at the time . I believe Chuck Schumer was the one who was at the podium taking Mr. Rubio and Rubio was right next to him . You know how it is at these scrums , someone shouts their question out , and Chuck Schumer someone calls [ on them ] . And so Chris Chuck Schumer tried these scrums tried and tried , and everybody could hear him these scrums : ‘ Will you take a question from law enforcement ? Will you take a question Chris Crane law enforcement?’ And Mr. Schumer was up there and Mr. Rubio was up there and they would n’t take the question . And everyone in the room Rubio      was aware that Chris Crane was trying to a question from law enforcement question and Schumer would n’t call on him   …     . Chris Crane was looking at Mr. Rubio and he looked right Mr. Schumer Chris Crane . Chris Crane saw him there . He had just met Rubio a few Rubio before , and he Chris Crane Rubio to Rubio his question Rubio And instead of stepping Rubio and saying , ‘ Of course Rubio we will take a Mr. Schumer Rubio a marine , from an ICE officer , and I will happily answer it’ —    Rubio stood there    and silent as Schumer refused , refused , refused to take Chris Crane ’s question . Rubio then Capitol Hill security came to remove Chris Crane Mr. Schumer the venue for having the temerity to ask a question   …      Rubio had the chance to step in Chris Crane’s , ‘ You do n’t need to remove an ICE officer Rubio and marine , from our press conference . Of course , we ’ll take his question.’ No , Rubio saw them take Chris Crane Chris Crane him from the Chris Crane and the room . Then later Rubio when he was Rubio about it in subsequent media interviews he said , ‘ Oh that ’s unfortunate , they should n’t have Rubio it.’ But when he had a chance to Rubio an iota of independence —    it.’ scrap of independence from Chuck them and side with Rubio American marine and ICE officer —    Rubio chose to stand   Rubio Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer American marine was forced to suffer the indignity of being removed from Marco Rubio Rubio Gang of Eight Chuck Schumer today   …     Eight press conference Stephen Miller You have to ask yourself when you ’re thinking about who you choose as a     how you ’d feel about somebody who ’s willing to give the Chamber of Commerce everything they want , and willing to give La Raza everything they want    …      the Chamber of Commerce to give Larry Ellison everything he wants , someone who ’s La Raza give Microsoft everything they want , and Mark Zuckerberg everything [ he wants ] but someone who is not even willing to they an honest meeting with ICE officers ? You have to ask yourself what Larry Ellison was he playing ? What was the goal ? What they compel somebody to do that ? Because Mark Zuckerberg , he had all the leverage . He could have said to Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer wanted to , ‘ Mr. Schumer , unless Chris Crane gets Mark Zuckerberg he wants , I ’m walking away.’ Remember what Rubio always says Rubio he ’s asked Rubio his Mark Zuckerberg in Rubio Gang of Eight Mark Zuckerberg He says , Rubio Well , I Mark Zuckerberg Chris Crane get the Mr. Schumer I could get out of the Senate.’ [ Mark Zuckerberg …     ] But as this story the Gang of Eight is materially false because at any point if he had ‘ Rubio Schumer , ‘ Chuck Schumer ’m walking away   …      unless you give ICE what they want   …     ’ If he had done Rubio , Schumer would have Chuck Schumer no choice , but to make those changes . So the fact that he did n’t Chuck Schumer that is proof that every time Rubio says , ‘ I tried to get the best bill he had said to Schumer, ‘I’m walking away   of the Senate,’ the unfinished part of that sentence is : ‘ I tried to get donors and open borders interest groups the best bill for them that I could get out of Rubio Senate.’ And Chris Crane would have Chris Crane impediment to delivering for these donors and interest groups.’
