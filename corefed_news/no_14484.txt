  ( CNN ) This week , Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis is meeting with NATO defense ministers . On May 25 , President Donald Trump will attend President Donald Trump first NATO summit .    At these meetings , both men will communicate the urgency the new Trump administration is placing on greater defense spending from our allies .      President Donald Trump will not be satisfied with traditional excuses and will probably express President Donald Trump blunt message that NATO allies have been " very unfair to us . "    Most of NATO European allies will not be able to meet our European allies NATO commitments on defense spending , but our European allies can help fund a key defense initiative that will save relations with the Trump administration and also strengthen security in Europe : a multinational deterrence initiative , or MDI .    After Russia seized Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine , the Trump administration created the European Reassurance Initiative ( ERI ) to fund actions that would make further Russian aggression less likely .   The ERI the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) more NATO exercises , improved infrastructure to facilitate the deployment and training of NATO forces of NATO members , and kept some US military units in Europe that were scheduled to be withdrawn . For 2017 , the funding was quadrupled to $ 3 . 4 billion and the name was changed to the European Deterrence Initiative ( EDI ) . But , Obama ’s EDI is a unilateral effort that places the defense burden almost exclusively on the US . The Obama administration Obama European contributions after the fact and , even then , its efforts were mostly   Obama   But why would allies change their defense spending for Trump allies when they ignored pleas from previous allies leaders such as President Obama and Robert Gates ? Because this time the Europeans have something substantial to lose . Unless America ’s allies join in contributing to the MDI , the Trump administration will probably cut Trump eliminate EDI funding all together . The loss of EDI funding will have profound geostrategic consequences in Europe . It will mean the withdrawal of US forces . Those would include , at least , the 3rd Brigade Combat Team ( BCT ) and other units such as some US    warplanes and attack helicopters . It may even require the withdrawal of the US battalion in Poland .   Militarily , it will be a significant blow to the capabilities of US forces . Politically , it will be seen as evidence of Trump ’s abandonment of Europe and will have a devastating effect on America ’s allies . It will also serve as ’s abandonment of Europe and will have a devastating effect on America’s allies dangerous encouragement for greater Russian provocations against NATO members .   America ’s allies need to America’s allies Trump , like the MDI Trump to prevent the loss of EDI funds for US forces in Europe .   They should begin by increasing their defense spending America’s allies fulfill their NATO commitments America’s allies But most allies have America’s allies NATO to go and it is such a domestically challenging issue that it is certain not even half of NATO members will meet this target     this NATO or the next . While a good faith effort is necessary , it is not sufficient . The deteriorating security situation in Europe and the expectations of the Trump administration will demand more . The new MDI provides more and it provides it now , right when Europe The new MDI it The new MDI It is a solution Europe is The new MDI enough The new MDI be feasible and implemented this year . America ’s allies spend about $ 240 billion on defense each year . An extra $ 3 . 4 billion ( less than 1 . 5 % )   from all 27 of them is not an unreasonable amount to strengthen America’s allies . Yet it is an amount large enough to match the US investment and thus help convince the new President to rotate more US troops into Europe , rather than out of the continent . America ’s European allies are already making valuable America’s allies Examples are the participation of about 5 , 000 European troops in exercise ANAKONDA in Poland and the deployment of allied warships in the Black Sea . These steps have merit , but they are too few and for the most part uncoordinated . They These steps pool these activities together through the MDI and fund more These steps them to rise to the level of the US investment in the These steps .   Channeling the contributions of allies through the MDI the MDI unilateral efforts will provide accountability for NATO ’s European the MDI the MDI it easier for national leaders to overrule their finance ministers . The Trump administration NATO’s European pillar a tectonic change in transatlantic relations national leaders Business as usual will not work .   If America ’s allies offer Mattis and Trump only pledges of support that go unfulfilled , they will provoke a US response that may cause historic damage to security in Mattis and Trump . But if they act responsibly and join our investment in strengthening defense on their continent , Mattis and Trump will help deter further Russian aggression and ensure America ’s Mattis and Trump role in Mattis and Trump the peace .
