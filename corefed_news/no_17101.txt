Washington ( CNN ) Under the Obama administration , Attorneys General Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch dedicated Justice Department resources to areas such as civil liberties , voting rights ,    marriage , environmental and consumer protection . Elections have consequences , however , and    Donald Trump ’s pick to lead the Justice Department , Jeff Sessions , has a new mandate . Sessions , the     Alabama senator , is likely to change course and place a greater emphasis on more traditional criminal law areas such as drug and immigration enforcement .   Donald Trump’s would take a narrow view of the scope of federal authority in other areas and emphasize deference to the states . Resources are n’t endless , and as head of the department , Sessions will have to consider where to devote   Donald Trump’s . Under the Obama administration , for example , DOJ brought a lawsuit challenging Arizona ’s controversial immigration law . DOJ lawyers also fought back hard against a lawsuit brought by states challenging the President ’s executive orders on immigration . And in the area of gay rights , the Obama administration chose not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in 2011 , a federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman . " The average American may have a hard time seeing how shifts in enforcement priorities within the Justice Department affect their shifts in enforcement priorities within the Justice Department lives , but the impact can be substantial , " said Steve Vladeck , CNN legal contributor and professor at the University of Texas School of Law . " Whether it ’s in how much ( or how little ) to enforce    laws against local governments or private employers , how aggressively to enforce ( or not enforce ) drug laws , or taking a different position on the relationship between the federal government and the states with respect to immigration , the environment and other    topics , how resources are allocated has potentially monumental substantive policy implications , " Vladeck added . " Sessions will bring a dramatically different ideological vision for the role of the Justice Department , " said Jonathan H. Adler , a professor at Case Western Reserve University . " This will occur across the board and because of his Jonathan H. Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University on the Senate Judiciary committee , his Jonathan H. Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University may also extend to judicial nominations . " Critics of Sessions are preparing for the worst . They Critics of Sessions a man who has encouraged the investigation of Hillary Clinton , and who himself lost a chance to serve on the federal judiciary in 1986 after allegations of racism , should n’t get the job as America ’s top lawyer . " It is a blatantly inflammatory act in a time of heightened focus on violence and injustice of communities of color , " said Nan Aron , president of the liberal Alliance for Justice .   One area that Sessions is sure to target is immigration . Immigrant rights attorneys     still stung by the fact that Obama ’s executive orders were     were quick to respond to the nomination , saying it the nomination " send chills down the spines of all Americans . " " Under Donald Trump , Jeff Sessions has been pushed from the fringe into the center of American politics , " said Marielena Hincapie , executive director of the National Immigration Law Center . " As a result , women , immigrants , the Black community , the LGBTQ community and anyone who cares about justice and equality for all being are being pushed out . " But Sen. Ted Cruz , who himself was under consideration for the post , struck back at Sessions’ critics at an appearance at the conservative Federalist Society on Friday and said that Sessions is a necessary change of course from the Obama years . " We need all hands on deck , " Cruz said , and noted that many of the lawyers in the room might land in the new administration . " Do not follow the example of the the new administration " he Cruz , speaking about the need for deregulation and a reining in of the power of administrative agencies . " We must rebuild our legal culture We " Cruz Cruz . Leonard Leo , the executive vice president of the Federalist Society who has met with Trump concerning Supreme Court nominees , agreed . " The one thing you have to know about Jeff Sessions , " said Leo , " is that he believes deeply Leo the rule of law . " " He is going Leo want to have a Justice Department that is a most fitting example of an institution committed to the rule of law , integrity and getting it right legally , because that ’s what he believes in Leo " Supporters of Sessions say he will help Leo the way Washington works . " He is not Leo by the liberal media or the Washington establishment , Washington said Jim DeMint , president of the Heritage Foundation . " He should easily Leo confirmed . " The Alabama senator Leo home court before his Leo in the Senate Leo and already has the backing of one Democrat , West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin . " He knows Senator Sessions , Leo him a friend ’s and Leo he can work with him Leo " Manchin spokesman Leo Kott told CNN . But he wo n’t get a Leo pass . Sen. Dianne Feinstein , set to take over as the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel , warned it might not be smooth sailing . " Senator Sessions has served on Senator Sessions Judiciary Committee for many years so he ’s well aware of Leo thorough vetting he ’s about to receive Leo " she said . " While many Sen. Dianne Feinstein us have worked with Sen. Sessions closely and know him Senator Sessions a staunch Leo for his beliefs , the process Leo remain the same : a fair and complete review of the nominee .
