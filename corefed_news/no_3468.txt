" There is no legal justification President Donald Trump’s , " Kaine said . " I think from a moral standpoint   —    absolutely , I agree with Kaine Rubio . It was the right thing to do . It is the right thing to do   —    to try to deter Bashar    from war crimes and remember , I voted to use military action against Syria in August of 2013 . Senator Rubio voted against it back then when Bashar    did the same thing . But I said the Senator Rubio to come to Congress . And Donald Bashar    , citizen Trump back then said exactly the Senator Rubio . A president has to go to Congress . He should not have done this without coming to Congress .
