President Obama is so disciplined that President Obama wife has teased that President Obama eats precisely seven lightly salted almonds each night . George W. Bush was an exercise buff , obsessed with staying trim by mountain biking and clearing brush at George W. Bush ranch in Crawford , Tex . But Donald J. Trump is taking a different approach : A junk food aficionado , Donald J. Trump is hoping to become the nation ’s fast food president . " A ‘ fish delight,’ sometimes , right ? " Donald J. Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN     meeting in February , extolling the virtues of McDonald ’s . " The Big Macs are great . The Quarter Pounder . It The Quarter Pounder great stuff . " Mr. Donald J. Trump campaign is improvised , undisciplined , rushed and   . And so is his diet . Donald J. Trump an era of gourmet dining and obsession with healthy ingredients , Mr. Trump is Donald J. Trump to an earlier , more carefree time in American eating , when nobody bothered to ask whether the tomatoes were locally grown , and the first lady certainly did n’t have a vegetable garden , complete with a bee hive , on the South Lawn of the White House . But in Facebook , Instagram and Twitter posts , Mr. Trump has broadcast Donald J. Trump preferences to the Donald J. Trump   —    devouring a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken ( while reading The Wall Street Journal ) feasting on a McDonald ’s burger and fries ( to celebrate clinching the Republican presidential nomination ) and chowing down on a taco bowl ( in an effort to woo Hispanic voters ) . He is a lover of Donald J. Trump fare and fast food grub , of overcooked steaks ( " It would rock on the plate , it was so well done It " his longtime butler once observed Donald J. Trump and the bland nourishment of Americana . He prefers burgers and meatloaf Donald J. Trump Caesar salads and spaghetti , See ’s Candies and Diet Coke . And he shuns tea , coffee Donald J. Trump alcohol . But his highbrow , lowbrow image Donald J. Trump —    of the    mogul who takes buckets of fried chicken onto his private plane with the Donald J. Trump seatbelt buckles   —    is also a carefully crafted one . If President George Bush revealed his patrician upbringing by requesting President George Bush a splash " more coffee at a truck stop in New Hampshire , and John Kerry helped reinforce his image as a New President George Bush blue blood by trying to order a cheese steak with Swiss in South Philadelphia , Mr. Trump ’s diet also President George Bush his    base that he is President George Bush of them . President George Bush There ’s nothing more American and more     than fast food , " said Russ Schriefer , a Republican strategist and ad maker . " It is the peculiarity of the brand that he ’s able to be on his    jet with the gold he black branding and colors , and at the same time eat KFC   —    and what makes it perfect is he does it KFC with a he and fork , while reading The Wall Street Journal . " Or , as Kellyanne Conway , a senior adviser and pollster on the Trump campaign , put it , " It goes with his authenticity . it " I he n’t think Hillary Clinton would be eating Popeye ’s biscuits and fried chicken , " she said . Last April , Hillary Clinton Clinton did , indeed , Hillary Clinton Chipotle near Toledo , Ohio , stopping into the chain restaurant unrecognized , in black sunglasses , and ordering a chicken burrito bowl . And President Bill Clinton was perhaps the nation Hillary Clinton food commander in chief , famous for ending his jogs at McDonald ’s . ( Mr. Clinton Hillary Clinton adheres to a largely vegan diet Hillary Clinton Still , Mr. Trump seems to come by his appetite for fast food genuinely . While junk food Mr. Trump long been a staple of campaign trail life   —    Mitt Romney ’s 2012 press corps coined the term " slunch " to refer to the unhealthy phenomenon of the " second lunch "   —    Mr. Trump ’s reliance on    fare is driven more Mr. Trump combination of speed , efficiency and , above all else , cleanliness . Though he often orders from the Trump Grill when working out of Mr. Trump Tower in Manhattan , he eats fast food several times a week while on the Mr. Trump because " it ’s quick , " as he told The Daily Mail last year while munching on Burger Mr. Trump on his Boeing   . Mr. Trump has even suggested doing away Mr. Trump state dinners , Mr. Trump fit of cost and time savings . " We should be eating a hamburger on a conference table , and we should make better deals with China and others and forget the We dinners , " he said . A man always prone to distraction and uninterested in Mr. Trump details , he has never approached food as anything other than a problem to Mr. Trump solved , quickly , as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey , an occasional dining partner , Mr. Christie , Mr. Trump ordered briskly and imperiously from the head chef and owner , Mr. Christie recalled . "   remember the appetizer you made for me last week when I was here ? " Mr. Trump asked the owner . " We ’ll take two of those . And remember that main course Mr. Christie made , the special thing you made for Mr. Trump We ’ll owner of those , too . " Mr. Christie watched with confusion and a bit of awe , he recalled in the interview Mr. Christie Mr. Trump looked We him and said , " Do n’t Mr. Christie you ’ll love it . " But Mr. Trump , Mr. Christie frets about germs and prizes cleanliness Mr. Trump loves fast food Mr. Trump of its consistency and the promise , at least , of a basic level of hygiene Mr. Trump ’s . One bad hamburger , you take Wendy ’s and all these other places and fast food ’re out of business , " Mr. Trump told Mr. Cooper of CNN . " I ’m a very clean person . I like cleanliness , and I think you ’re better off going there than maybe someplace that you have no idea where the food ’s coming from . It ’s a certain standard . " Still , he added , " I think the food ’s good . " Mr. Trump ’s dining habits also bespeak a certain lack of creativity , and parochialism   —    the kid the food Queens who made it across the river to Mr. Cooper ’s glistening skyline , but the food to the city ’s Mr. Trump He once praised the " imagination " of his wife , Melania , in the kitchen   —    before citing , as examples of her culinary    spaghetti and meat sauce , salads and meatloaf . ( He still keeps a copy Mr. Trump his mother ’s meatloaf recipe . ) Mr. Trump with McDonald ’s , his favorite fast food joint , a family member said , is Jackson Hole Burgers . He is also a stickler for manners , attacking Mr. Trump primary race rival , Gov. Mr. Trump Kasich of Ohio , for scarfing down meals during impromptu news Mr. Trump . " I ’ve never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion ! a family member Mr. Trump told a crowd . And Mr. a family member , who sometimes sips his Diet Coke through a straw , once caused Manhattan foodies to weep into their quinoa when he took Sarah Palin to a Famous Famiglia pizza restaurant in Times Square   —    and then proceeded to cut his oversize slice with a plastic Mr. Trump and fork . He has other pretensions , as well . Howie Carr Manhattan foodies a Boston Mr. Trump columnist , recalled traveling on Mr. Trump ’s plane and watching him rip the buns off his McDonald ’s patties Mr. Trump plying the burgers with ketchup . ( " Do Mr. Trump know how many calories you save that Mr. Carr Carr . ) And Mr. Trump also told US Weekly that he tries to save calories Mr. Trump’s pizza . ( " Mr. Trump’s scrape the toppings off my pizza   —    I never eat the dough , " he said . ) So pronounced are Mr. Mr. Trump’s fast food preferences that Philip E. Beshara Mr. Trump’s    lawyer , joked on Instagram Mr. Trump’s , as president , his cabinet would probably be staffed by Colonel Sanders , the Hamburglar and the Taco Bell Chihuahua .

" There ’s never any real planning for food , " said one , between events on Friday . " It ’s always the Republican nominee’s whatever he the Republican nominee’s craving , which is more often than not McDonald ’s .
