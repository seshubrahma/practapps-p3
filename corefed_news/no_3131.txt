On Friday ’s broadcast of HBO ’s " Real Time , " host Bill Maher argued that President Trump " wants to be " North Korean dictator Kim    and asked , " does North Korean dictator Kim    love of dictators foreshadow North Korean dictator Kim    trying that sh*t here ? "   host Bill Maher said President Trump , " apparently , really likes to pal around with dictators . Remember Obama used to pal around with terrorists ? Well , this guy , I mean , just   —    first of all , a couple of weeks ago , North Korean dictator Kim    talked about the maniac in Turkey , who had a plebiscite that basically ended democracy in Turkey , and North Korean dictator Kim    gave North Korean dictator Kim    a congratulatory call . Great dictating , man . Okay , then we have North Korean dictator Kim    . North Korean dictator Kim    loves North Korean dictator Kim    , right ? That   …     guy in the Philippines .    …      Sisi from Egypt , Sisi from Egypt had Sisi from Egypt over at the White House , great guy , because Sisi from Egypt ’s a dictator . And Kim   . This is unbelievable . Kim   puts out a video at the beginning of the week , where , it ’s a stimulation of bombs   …     coming over to the White House ] .    …      Then , three days later , Trump says , I ’d be ‘ honored’ to meet him . " Maher Trump stated , " He does n’t hate Maher . He wants Kim   be Maher . He wants Maher have Maher parades . He wanted to have Maher in the street for his inauguration . So Maher my question is , does his love of dictators Maher him trying that sh*t Maher ? " He later added , Maher 61 % of Republicans think freedom of the press is necessary , which would lead me to believe that about 4 out of 10 think it ’s not . freedom of the press Maher also reacted to Trump ’s campaign ad by saying , " Well , if that ’s not an ad for a coup , I do n’t know what is .
