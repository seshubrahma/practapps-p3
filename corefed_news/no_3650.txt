In the first joint press conference between U. S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , the German leader claimed that a trade deal between the U. S. and the EU would be like a trade deal between two countries . [ Trade was the topic of much of the press conference between the two leaders as President Trump has made the subject one of the pillars of President Trump administration . During the press questions , a reporter from German paper Die Welt asked Ms Merkel if Ms Merkel thought that a trade agreement between the EU and the U. S. would be multilateral or bilateral .   Ms Merkel said and agreement like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) would be bilateral , indicating that Ms Merkel viewed the European Union as the European Union own country , rather than a federation of countries . " I believe that Ms Merkel has clearly set out his Ms Merkel as to what trade agreements have to bring about for the American side as well . I personally do n’t think that Germany needs to negotiate and not the the European Union " We ’ve devolved Germany needs to negotiate and not the European Union competences to Germany needs to negotiate and not the European Union European Union the European Union European Union , or the European Union , negotiates on behalf of the member states , " Merkel said outlining that it is the unelected commission of the Merkel , whose role it is to be at the table for trade deals . " So that ’s not going to prevent us from concluding agreements and indeed this would then qualify as a bilateral agreement between the EU and the United States if we had it , " she added us " this question is will it benefit both countries or not ? this she said . President Trump has made she clear that he supports bilateral trade deals over multilateral President Trump that can often involve a dozen or more countries with different values and different economic interests . One of the president ’s first acts after assuming President Trump to scrap TTIP which , unlike Merkel , he did not believe was bilateral . The President Trump of Angela Merkel , that of    and of Merkel European Union , is being heavily challenged by countries like Hungary who wish to see reform in the union and more emphasis on the individual countries a centralised European Union the central EU bureaucracy . In April France will start the process of electing a new president and    migration candidate Marine Le Pen has already hit out at Merkel ’s philosophy saying that she , like Trump , wants to put her country migration candidate Marine Le Pen and end the experiment of centralised supranational migration candidate Marine Le Pen like the EU .   A win for Le Pen would EU a huge blow for Merkel and migration candidate Marine Le Pen .
