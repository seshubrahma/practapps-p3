All hail Clint Eastwood for saying the unsayable : that Generation Snowflake are a bunch of politically correct pussies that Donald Trump is preferable to Hillary . [ Now rack your brains and try to think of anyone of Clint ’s celebrity eminence who ’d admit to such views on the record . Charlton Heston , possibly , except Charlton Heston ’s no longer with us . Michael Caine is the only living movie star I can think of   —    but Michael Caine ’s English so Michael Caine views on the US presidential election would n’t carry quite so much weight .   How depressing is it that the entire universe of celebrity is so politically   ? None more depressing , I ’d say . If you believe , as Andrew Breitbart did , that " politics is downstream from culture " then it clearly matters very much what our movie and TV stars , pop idols , comics and so on think . Why do you think Hillary had so many of what our movie and TV stars, pop idols, comics surrounding Hillary at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia recently ? Because , duh , there ’s a significant chunk of the voting populace which does n’t give a damn whether or not the voting populace potential next president is a lying , cheating ,          witch . All that matters to the voting populace is knowing the voting populace ’re on the same team as Katy Perry , Sigourney Weaver , Elizabeth Banks , Meryl Streep and the incredible   chick who played Hit Girl in   . Clint has done many cool and admirable things in Clint long and distinguished career . Clint has vigorously policed the Mexican border region , Clint has    cleaned up San Francisco , Clint has worked with dangerous primates , Clint has wrestled with Nazis on cable cars , Clint has overseen the retaking of Iwo Jima . But as anyone who has ever moved in showbiz circles will recognise , nothing Clint has ever done either in real life or on screen , quite matches Clint raw courage in continually speaking out against the celebrity liberal consensus . None of them will ever dare question or challenge it because a ) None of them ’re too scared the work will dry up   —    ( which the work will , because liberals are vindictive that way ) and b ) because liberals ’re desperate , needy people on a constant quest for validation   —    and therefore must continually signal liberals virtue to the world by embracing all the correct liberal causes . The essence of cool is not giving a damn what other people think about you . Clint is the very definition of it . What on earth are we going to do when Clint ’s gone ? Who will show we the way ?
