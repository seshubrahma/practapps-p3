’   ’ ’    The Democratic Party is in the midst of an identity crisis   —    but    a leading Democratic senator said a leading Democratic senator has an idea of what the left    needs to do in order to win at the ballot box in 2018 and 2020 . ’ ’    Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island , speaking with Business    Insider during a promotional tour for a leading Democratic senator new    book ,   ’ ’   ’ ’    " I think one of the reasons I wrote this book is that I think    this issue needs to be brought out front and center , " a leading Democratic senator said .    " If you have to compete with an entity that is actually a front    group for a big special interest and you haven’’t successfully    told the story of how it’ ’s just the end of the tentacle , then    you’’re going to be at a huge disadvantage . And what   you’’re says will    be given more    credit by the public than if more   credit knew ,    ’’ Oh , OK , that’ ’s the glove with the Koch brothers hand in it , with    Wall Street’ ’s hand in Wall Street’ . ’’ So I think it’ ’s really important we    focus on that . " ’ ’    Whitehouse added disclosure of donations " ought to be a really ,    really big deal for us . " ’ ’    The second plank , he said , needs to be a " really , really strong    and simplified economic message , " something he said    Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton did not do in 2016 .   ’ ’    " And we love , love , love to prove we bona fides by having a    really good plan , " he said . " And nobody wants to hear about a    plan . They want a wall or something simple and captivating . And      plans kind of go in the metal disposal bin . " ’ ’    " Stuff that people can envision and we can deliver , " he added .    " I’’ve spent 10 years in the Senate now and the talk about    messaging is making me increasingly insane . I don’’t think you    earn the right to a message until you’’ve earned it by having a    real fight , really being willing to stand up for what you believe    in . " ’ ’    He said Democrats ’’ tendency to be " constantly " moving " from    message point to message point , positioning yourself on    issues without ever taking a step back , deciding what the hell    you’’re going to do , and jamming it through as best you can , or at    least making it one hell of a big fight so that everyone in the    country knows that it took place , " is a major " mistake . " ’ ’    The party must take a handful of issues and be exceptionally    visible on a handful of issues , he said , naming    relief and a    carbon tax as two such things . ’ ’    " You can pick others , but I think having just a visible known few    that become our , ’’ If you elect our , this is what you will get or    our will die trying , ’’ " he said . ’ ’    The third plank , he said , was making sure the party is " solid " on    the party national security and defense platform . ’ ’    Far too often , he added , Democrats let Democrats get painted as    weak on both . ’ ’    " I think that’ ’s where , just not letting ourselves get painted    into a     corner , "    said . " But I think that having    a lot of respect for law enforcement and showing law enforcement , having a lot    of respect for the military and showing law enforcement   —    and getting ahead of    the big liabilities like cybersecurity are very good places to    be . " ’ ’    " I don’’t think that’ ’s going to be a winning hand for us , but that’    keeps . .. a winning hand from becoming a winning hand for    the Republicans , "    continued . ’ ’    The GOP has been extremely successful in painting the Democrats    as soft in those areas ,    added . ’ ’    " Look at 2014 when ISIS popped up and Ebola popped up and the    children from Guatemala and Central America were starting to come    across the border , "    said . " And the next thing you know Fox    News had turned that all into the Ebola babies coming over the    borders to come slice your head off like ISIS into kind of one    big panic . And our Democratic message that election was exactly    zero . And we just got crushed as a result . " ’ ’    " So that’ ’s the proof that we can’’t let we get boxed in on    it , " that’ continued . " Because frankly , we had just as good policies    if not better in those areas . we just don’’t talk about frankly, we had just as good policies   if not better in those areas . " ’ "    Each of the three seems to come back to one core idea : that    Democrats do n’t have Democrats messaging together , or have n’t been    able to effectively get Democrats message across . " ’    So why have the Democrats struggled so mightily with this ? ’ ’    " Well , I think if I knew that I would be a bigger wheel in our    operation , " Whitehouse said . " I don’’t know the answer to that . I    think partly    comes from the sort of         politics that can emerge from a party that has very broad but not    particularly deep backing . So , you’’ve got right with Planned    Parenthood , you’’ve got right with the LGBT community , you’’ve got    right with public labor unions , you’’ve got right with the private    labor unions , you’’ve got right with young voters , and you kind    of , every time you do that , there’ ’s another added step . " ’ ’    " And like the guy with 1 , 000 nails , nothing penetrates because    there are so many nails you can actually lie on the guy with 1, 000 nails    comfortably , "    continued . " So nothing actually sank through . " ’ ’   ’ ’    " So , I don’’t know , those are some of my original thoughts , "       continued . " If we were . .. if it were just a few more centralized    forces who ran our party , then you would say , ’’ All right , these    are the sort of three or four things we’’re pushing on . ’’ And    to the folks in other industries who aren’’t part of those    three or four , we’’d just say , ’’ Look , shut up for now   —    we’’re    trying to win this election . We’’ll take care of you when we’’re    in . You know we will . So stand by . You don’’t have to clamor . ’’ " ’ ’    Democratic voters must take a viewpoint that many on the right    have been able to more easily embrace , particularly in electing    President Donald Trump   —    a focus on winning . ’ ’    " Everybody , to have their issue at the forefront as your measure    of success   —    your measure of success is we get in , and then we    deliver for you , "    said . " And , that simply doesn’’t work on we    side the way it does on the other side . " ’ ’    " For we , it’ ’s an uphill fight to get a clear , distinctive ,    memorable message out of the cacophony of we multiple    support groups , " it’ continued . " For the other side , it’ ’s actually    kind of delivered to the other side by the organizations behind the other side that    dominate in the Republican political background . .. and so I    think my colleagues kind of sit on the table reading from the    package . When the   package comes , my colleagues go out and sell the   package . Whereas we’’re    all like out with everybody making sure it’ ’s success for us if us    get we    idea on the table and the platform has to have 90    different parts to it and if anybody is left out they’’re all    jumping up and down about it .
