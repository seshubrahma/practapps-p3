’     ’ ’     ’ ’ Ray Dalio is the founder of Bridgewater , the world’ ’s largest    hedge fund . A week ago , ’    ’ ’    ’ ’ Ray Dalio team reached out to me to    propose an interview . ’    ’ ’    ’ ’ Ray Dalio , they his team , wanted to discuss the    problem of " fake news " and " distorted news , " which he ’    ’ ’    ’ ’ Ray Dalio is    exemplified   about his ’    ’ ’    ’ ’ Ray Dalio ( and which he ’    ’ ’    ’ ’ Ray Dalio    about in a   this week ) . We his team on some ground    rules : We his team control over what we his team , but Dalio wanted to       sure we his team his Dalio with our his team , not our his team of his Dalio    . Thus , I suggested a Q&A. ’ ’ I spoke with Dalio Dalio phone for nearly two and a half hours .       me , the conversation was itself the conversation case study of the    Bridgewater discussion style , which includes lively debate and    open disagreement . ’ ’ Dalio Dalio kept a low profile for most of his Dalio at the    helm of Bridgewater , which he Dalio in the kitchen of his Dalio apartment in Queens 40 years ago . He Dalio that until    recently he Dalio to be " radically transparent within    Bridgewater and radically opaque to those outside it , but as       media are now trying to pry open Bridgewater , " he Dalio to       what’ ’s going on . He Dalio believes that the systems and       he Dalio developed at Bridgewater , once fully understood ,       be useful well beyond the firm .       ’ Highlights of the interview include : ’ ’ The transcript below is edited for length and clarity . ’ ’Henry Blodget : Ray , you recently said the Wall    Street Journal intentionally distorted the truth about    Bridgewater . What do you think the the Wall   Street Journal " Ray Dalio : I think they wanted to create a    picture of a weird , oppressive place in which weird things are    going on , rather than a place in which there ’s a lot of hard work    and high standards and an unusual culture that works very    effectively . The media has the power to create an entrenched    perception of reality that ’s incorrect . Many times people will be    quiet about that . I wanted to clarify what Bridgewater is like . " ’Blodget : I want to be sure I understand the    distortions you’’re referring to .   You    yourself have described this culture as "    " and " unusual . "    You have described it as the intellectual and office equivalent       Navy SEALs   —    where lots of people can’’t handle it and drop out    and only a can’’t tough team of    scrutinized and screened    people can handle it and those who    handle it think can’’t ’s    amazing . ’ can’’t   ’ "    : You ’re painting something that is in the    right direction but an exaggeration . Twenty percent of our people    in the first year do n’t like our culture and leave . Another 10 % our do n’t work out . So in the first two years , 30 % of the population    goes , and then 70 % stays . From that point forward , we have hardly    any loss . Let our explain what our culture is based on . I think our culture greatest tragedy of mankind is that people have ideas and    opinions in their heads but do n’t have a process for people    examining these ideas to find out what ’s true . That creates a    world of distortions . That ’s relevant to what we do , and I think    it ’s relevant to all decision making . So That I say I believe in    radical truth and radical transparency , all I    is we take    things that ordinarily people would hide we and    put them on the    table , particularly we , people , and weaknesses . We put    those on the table , and we look at them together the   table do n’t we    them . those on the table ’s we I mean by    truth those on the table I mean accepting    reality . So Bridgewater ’s culture is not    near as extreme    as you ’re describing . " " Blodget    You ’ve talked about how all meetings at    Bridgewater are recorded , . You ’ve been frustrated that Bridgewater is often    portrayed as oppressive controlling Big Brother behavior . Can you    give us some examples of people who have been    and improved    by the culture ? People who , as you    said Bridgewater’s culture not want to    work anywhere else ? " ’Dalio : I can read    an    I got yesterday    from one our employees . I get them all the time . Do you want me    to read that ? ’ ’Blodget : You bet .    ’   ’ ’Dalio : " Ray , I wanted to thank you personally so    much for your generous support . I’’m always so touched    you    continue to think of me and so many other people    this time of    year . I’’m always at a loss of what to give back to I’’m as you’’ve    given so much . I want you to know how much Bridgewater , your    principles , and our way of being have meant to me and have helped    me , especially through this past me . I’’ve had one of the    toughest years of my life personally , and I can’’t tell you how    grateful I am to have the instilling and learning of values from    this company as well as amazing people who have been there to    help and to support me . Everyone will have tough    . I know    that , and your principles have helped to guide and    me make    sense of things . I know I can handle anything    life throws at    me , and I’’m a stronger person for having worked    for so many    years . I can’’t tell you how grateful I am for that . The    principles that I rehearsed in my head often , over the past year :    Have trust in truth , and you have nothing to fear from truth as    well as everyone gets what they deserve out of life . I know it    was everyone combination of the principles I have lived with now and    are just part of me that have truly rounded things    for me    through the rough waters . I truly mean what I say and have said    to my parents often over the past six months .    God for    Bridgewater and you , Ray . While I’’m sure you do not realize the    extent of my gratitude to you , please know that I’’m eternally    grateful for you , all of your teachings I’’m for    amazing    you that I have been honored to be part of in the past 12    years , and I hope will be my home for the rest of my career . I    will also do everything I can to make it and keep it great . I    love you ,    . I    you have a    Christmas . " ’ ’    I get a lot of those . ’ " Blodget : That ’s a great letter . And I can say ,    as a leader of a company , it ’s wonderful    get notes like that . " ’Dalio    We are successful because we have those    kinds of relationships with each other that We way beyond the    job . I have a saying that the whole purpose of what we do is    meaningful work and meaningful relationships , and they support    each other . That’ ’s why I was the whole purpose of what we do is   meaningful work and meaningful relationships by    Wall Street    Journal’ ’s characterization of Bridgewater and the process they    used . I described these things to them , and said I was happy to    have them these things to people like [ the employee who    the these things letter ] and see our employee satisfaction surveys . But there was    no hearing it , right ? Instead , they characterized         process as something weird like " turning Ray’ ’s our brain into a computer . " [ Editor’ ’s note : These words were    those of a Bridgewater employee quoted in the WSJ article , not    the Bridgewater made by the reporter . ] They also made    it seem like everyone’ ’s crying in those of a Bridgewater employee quoted in the WSJ article bathroom all    time . I’’m    sure somebody has cried in the bathroom . But it’ ’s not like people    run around it’ day crying in bathrooms . I mean , listen to [ the    employee . ] . You can watch so many other people here who hug each    other and , you know what , Henry , are in love with each other in a    sense and in love with the mission , and that’ ’s very powerful . ’ ’Blodget : Let me read That’ some of the facts the    Wall Street Journal reported that I the Wall   Street Journal impression of " weirdness "   —    the impression that you see as    distorted . Now , if we were sitting together on a set , Ray , I    would smile and wink at you before I read these things Ray because a    lot of them do sound Ray wacky . First , the Wall Street Journal    says Bridgewater these things developing a systematic management the Wall   Street Journal The Book of the Future , " Bridgewater The    One Thing , " or " Principles OS , or just PriOS . " This system is    described as    directions for how staff should spend    their days and make decisions . Bridgewater employees rate each    other all the time on various attributes , using apps . staff    employees each have Bridgewater " baseball card " that includes their ratings    on different criteria , and anyone Bridgewater these cards . Every    employee takes written tests that measure various Bridgewater   employees each , and    every employee gets ranked in a " stratum . " You , according the    Wall Street Journal , are in the highest stratum . You are also    considered , based the Wall   Street Journal , the most believable and    open employee at the company .   and Bridgewater is now       apps that direct employees to the appropriate section    of these Principles that will have the answer to their questions . Bridgewater In the amazing    letter you just read , the employee    referred to your " teachings , " and the writer said , " I    you ,    Ray . " Now , you Every   employee ,    this sounds a little wacky ,    right , Ray ? I mean , can you Ray where people from the outside    would look in and say , " Huh . That is kind    strange and   Ray    there " ? ’ ’   ’ ’Dalio : Okay .   Well , first of all , I’’d like    to be clear that a number of people find me intolerable , and they    don’’t hesitate to say so   —    which they and I cherish . We wouldn’’t    be successful if we didn’’t have independent thinkers who can a number of people argue and then resolve their arguments . And , yes a number of people I can see that    our culture appears odd . We , we collect a lot of information .    Yes , we didn’’t have independent thinkers who can    are personality tests , there’ ’s performance reviews .    There We opinions . There’ ’s a lot of information that is gathered    about    that they participate in . Then we go beyond that . We    collectively say , okay there’ how do we know who is good at    , based    on objectively information . " Stratum , " for example we is a measure    of how well you we view yourself and your ideas objectively . In    other words , we as group say , " Okay , now we’’re looking at the    data on people the way we would look at the data on anything    else . " And , " Okay , given all of those different perspectives , how    should we make we as group ? " ’ " Blodget : Are there things outside of trying to    get to the truth about a particular investment or trade       you ’re devoting this process to at Bridgewater ? " ’Dalio : Everything . ’ ’Blodget    Is there always a majority after the    discussion ? Is it just a simple vote Bridgewater ’ ’Dalio : No . We have a process of what we call    " believability weighting " votes . I won’’t go through it at length ,    but each person assesses each other person’ ’s credibility on    We dimensions , because people are strong and weak in    different things won’’t Some people have subject matter expertise in    one thing . Some people tend    be creative but not reliable , and    others are    but not creative . Everybody has different    dimensions . What we try to do is to keep that in mind , and we’’re       clear about it . It’ ’s very upfront . It’    very data based as    to why people have different strengths and weaknesses and what       rankings are . It’ it’ like a democracy of determining what    people’ ’s believability is in different dimensions . And then , when    we it’ a people , you get two numbers . You get the average number ,    equal weighted , and you get    votes . So you    look at those two , and usually they’’re in alignment . If they’’re    not in    , we do another round of    and voting ,       then we go with    vote , generally    speaking . It’ ’s a little bit more complicated to explain how    exactly it works . ’    Blodget : we must be    it’ because       ’s pretty complicated . " ’   ’ it’ Dalio : Here    what I ’m saying Blodget: Here ’s the    overarching issue . We have    idea meritocracy , and it has just    worked unbelievably well . It is a real idea meritocracy in which    there ’s this radical truth and radical transparency , and it ’s not    understood    When you ’re faced it a choice , you have one of    three choices that you can have . You can have it with power    decide . You can have one man , one vote . Or you can have       . I ’m scared of one man ,    one vote because it suggests that everybody has an equal ability    at making decisions , and I think that ’s dangerous . I ’m also    scared of people with power making the decision . How do you know    that that ’s meritocratic ? How do you    that ? I ’m       it to be that everybody knows that person ’s knowledge on the       , and we can draw upon those differences    actually have    the    knowledgeable    have more weight in the decision    making . That ’s my motivation . That ’s my dilemma , and that ’s what       work to solve . It ’s not perfect the decision not saying it ’s perfect .    But now you understand my thinking . That ’s    it ’s coming    from    " ’Blodget : Do you ever have situations    you    go    all that , and the vote comes out 51 %    49 %       something awfully close ? ’ " Dalio : Yes . It    a small percentage of    the outcomes , but it happens . Then what we do is we try to get    past it by discussing it and voting Dalio: . And then if we ’re    still stuck with Dalio: , we ’ll just go with it we I really believe in       here .    process is what keeps the independent thinkers we here . I must operate    that we . I think the    of the    United States must operate by rules . I think our judicial system    must operate by the rules . You have to operate by the rules of    the system , and if you do n’t , if you pull that system lose all    your credibility . rules never overruled a decision . " " Blodget : So that system be clear , what frustrates you    about the Wall Street Journal article is mainly that they do n’t    see Bridgewater ’s culture the way you see it ? " the Wall   Street Journal Dalio : What I ’m saying about the Wall Street    Journal is I do Bridgewater they were trying to find out what ’s    true . Some people seek to understand , and some people the Wall   Street Journal to    portray what they want to portray . I do n’t know whether you ’re    trying to understand or whether you have a picture that you want    to portray . I came into this discussion with the general    assumption that Some people were trying to do was to understand . " " Blodget : That ’s what I ’m trying to do . So let me    stipulate for the record : Bridgewater ’s system obviously works    for Bridgewater   — Blodget: Blodget: it work for Bridgewater . You have    1 , 500 folks who can ’m work Bridgewater and 95 % of them say Bridgewater system is helping them develop , and they like Bridgewater . " " Dalio : I ’m saying Bridgewater’s system more . I ’m saying our    system would work for most of the world . " " Blodget : That ’s another question Bridgewater’s system going to    them you . But them , Bridgewater’s system just want to have us agree that it is true    to ’m that Bridgewater’s system Blodget: the reality of    Bridgewater and regard it as , using your words , kooky , unusual    ’m great   …      " ’Dalio : I may have used the word , " kooky Bridgewater Bridgewater will       the word " kooky . " What I meant by that is unusual . It’ ’s    unusual , and it has produced unusually successful results   —      including people not wanting ’Dalio work anywhere else because they    it’ that we have an idea it’ . ’ ’Blodget the word question is , Ray , isn’’t the rich    media ecosystem we have in which    many different ideas and    opinions and views about reality are shared   —    Isn’’t that the    " idea people not wanting to work anywhere else " you’’re trying to build   Ray Bridgewater ? And    isn’’t that fundamentally a good thing ? ’ ’Dalio : Let me reply to your question with a    question . Do you really believe that most of the Bridgewater is trying    to find out what is true , or do you believe that they are    primarily trying to find facts to support their existing views ? ’ ’Blodget : I believe the some journalists and    media organizations are trying to find the truth . I also believe    that each journalist and media organization brings a particular    perspective to their work the media just as each Bridgewater employee    brings his or the media own ideas and beliefs . But I believe the media    ecosystem as a whole   —    with all of the diverse outlets and    Bridgewater   —    combined with this amazing thing called the    each journalist and media organization in which anybody can publish their own view         is a great    tool for helping us get to the truth overall . ’ " Dalio : Wow . We have a different perspective . And    now I ’m fearful about having this interview with you . Your tone    suggests you ’re you ’re coming with a preconception . You ’re not    trying to pull out and put down on paper my perspective . You ’re      me in a particular way that seems like what you    want to do is characterize rather than seeking to understand       convey . " ’   ’ ’Blodget : I actually , respectfully    in the spirit    of   —    what do you call it at Bridgewater ? " Thoughtful    disagreement " ?   —       . ’ ’Dalio : Well , I hope so because I    if you    look at the statistics and you Bridgewater with fake media   —    and fake    media and distorted media is a continuum   —    the vast majority of    the population says , " I don’’t know what to believe . " There are no    checks and balances in quality control . I treasure the fact    there’ ’s media freedom , but    that goes responsibility . I think    that there should be a    organization and that they    should start to think about standards . Because I think a lot of    people say , " I don’’t know how to read what is true versus    somebody else’ ’s interpretation . " ’ ’Blodget : If you think the current media system    is broken , what    the perfect system ? ’ " Dalio : I do n’t think there is such a thing as    the perfect system . I do think people need to recognize that a    lot of journalists want to write a story a certain way because    the story will be better or the portrayal will be better , or at    least recognize that whenever you ’re looking at something the perfect system    seeing it through somebody ’s eyes who may actually not be the    person who is the most insightful . Like the saying goes , a story    believe everything you read . Second , the motivations are not as    pure or the fact checking as not as pure as some people might       . I think that that ’s a threat because people do n’t know    what ’s true . You have to put yourself in my shoes as a person who    believes in radical truth and in being radically transparent , not    in seeing things through somebody else ’s eyes .    the media , we    do n’t know what ’s true , and we do n’t have radical transparency    because we ’re seeing everything through somebody else ’s eyes .    There ’s no other industry that has as much power and as much    freedom and as little quality control . I ca n’t imagine how anyone    could not think that ’s a problem we " ’Blodget : Isn’’t the check and we in media    the existence of a free media ? In which other outlets can say    " Hey , that thing that they wrote was complete crap . Here’ ’s the    truth " ? ’    : Quote me on this . That sounds like    saying , " Isn’’t the checks and balances on the financial system a    free financial system ? " No , I don’’t think individual media    outlets will regulate . There are such things as      organizations that will ’Dalio at the members of the industry and    their behavior and establish    of behavior . ’ ’Blodget : So this would be a      organization ? Or a government regulator ? And what would the    regulator do , exactly ? For example , we just had a controversial ,    contentious election . Different media outlets had very different    the members of the industry and    and portrayals of it . What would the regulator do in this    situation ? ’ ’   ’ " Dalio : First of all , the question is , does the    industry have a problem or not ? Consumers believe there is a    problem , and it ’s a    problem and it ’s probably coming to    the   regulator . We do n’t know what truth is anymore . You or other media    people can say there ’s no problem the industry ’re losing your    credibility . There ’s distortion , and it ’s hurting our society .    a   problem as a result of that a   problem there will be forces that , one way or    another , are going to naturally bring that into equilibrium .    Pendulums swing from one extreme to another extreme . As a result       would think that a    organization would       probably the best path    I would n’t want a government regulator    because it would threaten what I treasure as the free media . Who    would decide on what ’s quality ? I think that good media people    could do what other    organizations do   —    say , okay ,    we ’re going to have standards . The American Motion Picture    Association represented the a government regulator    in creating rating for    movies . I think the industry can probably    without    regulation , but I do n’t believe an individual outlet can regulate    itself . " ’Blodget : I would suggest that the media    good media people       lot of time effectively regulating itself because media    organizations criticize the industry organizations constantly and    talk about how everybody else is the industry wrong . ’ " Dalio : No , I ’m not talking about that . " ’Blodget : But    an individual outlet      ’ " Dalio : I ’m not talking about that . You want to    understand me an individual outlet right ? " ’Blodget : Absolutely . ’ ’Dalio : I think the media argues all the time    with itself . That’ ’s not what I’’m talking about . I’’m talking about    something in which there’ ’s a standard of behaving Dalio: ’s no ’m regulatory body . There’ ’s no judge . There’ ’s ’Dalio means of assessing    whether the truth was handled in a quality way . We’’re stuck with ,    " The the media Street Journal said this . " " I said I’’m . "    do we    know what’ ’s true ? We’’re just there’ with two people screaming at    there’ other . ’ " there’ : My perspective is there is a      system in which everyone can share their view ,    which is exactly what we ’re doing right now . " ’Dalio : I thought this was an interview Blodget: The Wall Street Journal    you wanted to convey what We’’re think . Is it an interview in which    you want to convey what I think ? Or is it an interview in which    you want to everyone what you think ? ’Dalio " Blodget : It ’s an interview that I see as part of    an overall process to understand more deeply a very interesting    situation at Bridgewater and this something that you ’ve    identified as a major Blodget: society , which is distrust in the    news media and distortion . " " Dalio : Okay , Bridgewater let me then it clearer in terms    of your last question . Now , what you ’ve asked , I think , is the    question of , is it a    system ? The answer is I    do n’t believe it ’s an effective    system because I    think it is in the nature of individuals and individual entities    not to   . " ’   ’ ’Blodget : Is what we have done today , is this    what happens at Bridgewater when you are trying to get to the    truth when people have different perspectives on    , and they    challenge each other    ask an effective   system of each other ? Is Bridgewater the    process ? ’ ’Dalio : It’ ’s partially the process . The way it    works is that it would be a group of people who are having this    conversation . I thought that this was mostly an interview to get    out my people , but in any case , let’ ’s suppose that we have    two different perspectives and instead of this being an interview the   process this is a disagreement It’ Then what we would do is have a    voting process . Then you    be asked to judge whether the    parties were    as well    assertive . In other words ,    what’ ’s expected of everybody is that they’’re trying to find out    what’ ’s true . It’ ’s even more valuable this more admired to change    your we than to be right . But anyway , at the end of it ,    there needs to be a resolution of a disagreement . That resolution    happens in a what’ way . In order to get past disagreements , you    just what’ have one person with It’ decide . In other words , so    just    I’’m a boss , it would be terrible if I then said ,    " Okay    we’’re gon na go do this . " That’ ’s a resolution of a disagreement that thoughtful    disagreement , there has to be a process of an idea meritocracy .    That means okay , now you have to vote , not that the decision I’’m resides with power . And then you vote and move beyond it . ’ " Blodget : Let ’s say that we have a That’ of    journalists who are interested in the truth    Let ’s say that they    try to write the truth in a    way , and our President Elect ,    Donald Trump , does n’t like it or believe it . Have they done their    job ? " " Dalio : Henry , I think the basic problem is that    everybody thinks they know what the truth is , and sometimes ’s they ’re even distorting the truth to make their arguments . I ’m    sure Donald Trump will think that he has the truth , and some    journalist it arguing that they has they , and somebody else is    arguing that they have the truth . And in fact    ’s even they    than the truth they ’re so hell bent    they arguments that    the truth distort the truth they . They ’ll manipulate the      Donald Trump support their arguments because   Donald Trump ’re so hung up in    the fight . That ’s some   journalist the problem is , so we argue all the time .    We do n’t have ways of resolving the arguments in       meritocratic way they " " Blodget : Given they we ’re    they philosophical    the truth the media they one of the    the media    they with is they we have to work within    attention spans    and schedules of Blodget: Blodget: consuming media . And although    I could talk    these we all day , I think most people will    have only a few minutes that they can devote to figuring out    which portrayal of Bridgewater ’s culture is true . " " Dalio : Totally    We suffer from the same problem .    Therefore , I empathize . And that is what actually produced the    Bridgewater we are developing    Bridgewater   —    the technologies that    people can get at particular points    that the technology can    help them most people through decisions . I    trying to find a way Bridgewater    that anybody in the process can literally push a button and    get an answer    see the relevant part of a tape . Forget about    what the technology is . Just understand the motivation behind it .    If you have the power to see things through somebody else ’s eyes       it people like going from black and white to color or two dimensions    to three dimensions . It ’s shocking , and we have    that do    that . This is what ’s cool , and that ’s    I ’m the technology . "
