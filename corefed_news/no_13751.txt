Friday on ABC ’s " The View , "    Joy Behar said Pope Francis had to " speak out " about Republican presidential    Donald Trump wanting to a build wall instead of " bridges " because Joy Behar said , " Not to go into Hitler at all , but during World War II , the Pope did n’t speak out against what was happening to the Jews . "   While discussing the Pope comments with guest Eva Longoria , Behar said , " He has the Pope speak out in my opinion . You know , not to go into Hitler at all , but during World War II , the Pope did n’t the Pope against what was happening to the what was happening to the Jews they hold it the Jews .
