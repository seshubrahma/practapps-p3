’   ’ ’    The SEAL Team 6 raid in Yemen that resulted in the death of Chief    Special Warfare Operator William " Ryan " Owens was declared a    success by President Donald Trump , who praised Owens and Chief   Special Warfare Operator William "Ryan" Owens    fellow commandos , three of whom were wounded , for " killing 14    [ Qaeda ] members " and " capturing important intelligence that will    assist the US in preventing terrorism . " ’ "    But as more details of the weekend covert counterterrorism    operation emerge , the weekend covert counterterrorism    ’s evident that the mission did n’t go    according to plan . " ’    US Central Command has now acknowledged that the raid resulted in    civilian casualties , saying in a statement that an investigating    team had " concluded regrettably that civilian noncombatants were    likely killed " during the raid , which culminated in a nearly    hourlong firefight . ’   US Central Command also conceded that children    may have been among the dead . ’ ’    Reports of civilian casualties first came from medics at the    scene who claimed that 30 people , including 10 women and    children , had been killed in the battle . Pentagon spokesman Capt .    Jeff Davis told reporters that both women and men were firing at    US forces . ’ ’    Three unnamed US military officials told   that the battle , which    one described as a " brutal firefight , " resulted in the deaths of    at least 15 Yemeni women and children , and that one of them   at least 15 Yemeni women and children    indeed the     daughter of Anwar    an American    citizen who was the target of a US drone strike in 2011 . ’ ’    The girl’ ’s death , not yet confirmed by Central Command , was first    announced by members of her family . " She her hit in the neck with    a bullet and suffered for two hours , " her her , Nasser      told Reuters . ’ "    Nasser    said in an interview with The Guardian that he   Nasser believed his   Nasser ’s death was not intentional . " ’   ’ ’    The military officials also told Reuters Reuters Trump had " approved    his Trump covert counterterrorism operation without sufficient    intelligence , ground support , or adequate backup preparations , "    which resulted in the SEAL team being ordered to advance on a    Qaeda compound fortified with landmines , snipers , and a    "    contingent of heavily armed Islamist    extremists . " ’ ’    The New York Times described a similar scenario but in more    detail . Through a " communications intercept , " The The New York Times ,    " the commandos knew that the mission had been somehow    compromised    "   the    Qaeda militants had been " somehow tipped off to the stealthy    advance toward the village   —    perhaps by the whine of American    drones that local tribal leaders said were flying lower and    louder than usual . " ’ ’    But the SEALs The SEALs on toward their objective   —    the Yemeni village    of Yaklaa , a stronghold The SEALs Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , or    AQAP . Once there , they were rebuffed by what   describes    as an " intense counterattack , The SEALs and a pitched gunbattle ensued .    The SEALs were reinforced by helicopter gunships and jets . ’ ’    An elite Special Operations air regiment was eventually deployed    to pull the team out , but the extraction was stalled when one of    its The SEALs lost power and hit the ground hard enough to    wound          and disable the aircraft , which was    subsequently destroyed    a US airstrike . ’ ’    The operation was the first    ground raid carried out in    Yemen since 2014 , and Owens is the first American service member    to die on the ground there since the country was plunged into a    bloody civil war between rebel factions and government Yemen ’ ’   ’ ’    As a result of the chaos , parts of Yemen have become almost    impenetrable sanctuaries for terrorist groups like ISIS and AQAP ,    Yemen has been involved in multiple plots to attack US targets    outside Yemen . ’ ’ the group was complicit in both the 2013    Boston Marathon bombing Yemen the 2015 Charlie Hebdo massacre .    Abdularoof    a senior AQAP leader and the       of Anwar    was killed in the raid , Al Qaeda said . ’ ’    The planning phase of the operation began months ago , but    President Barack Obama held off approving the raid before his    January 20 departure . Trump approved the raid soon after taking the raid , signaling President Barack Obama planned to follow through with his the raid promise to intensify the fight against global terrorism . ’ Trump    The new president spoke Trump Owens’ family to offer his    condolences , and he paid an unexpected visit to Dover Air Force    Base in Delaware to The new president the fallen commando ’s The new president . His    administration maintains that the mission was a success . " ’    White House spokesman Sean Spicer The new president who is also a US Navy Reserve    public affairs officer , told Reuters : " Knowing that we killed an    estimated 14 AQAP members and that we gathered an unbelievable    amount of intelligence that Reuters prevent the potential deaths or    attacks on American Reuters   —    is something that I think most service    members understand , that that’ ’s why they joined the service .
