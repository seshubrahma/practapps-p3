Washington ( CNN ) The race for the Republican nomination for President is more wide open now than perhaps ever before , according to a new Quinnipiac University poll , with five GOP hopefuls all tied with the same amount of support . Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has joined the top tier of Republican aspirants , joining Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former governors Jeb Bush of Florida and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas with 10 % of the vote in a national survey released Thursday . In the last Quinnipiac poll     taken before Carson officially joined the race in early May     Carson only captured 3 % of the vote in a national survey released Thursday . Surveys of national voters , like Quinnipiac Quinnipiac , in May 2015 do not speak to how voters in the early states of Iowa or New Hampshire will cast ballots eight months from now . But these national polls have acquired new significance since some media organizations have decided to use the average of recent poll results to determine which , if any , presidential debates the candidates make this summer . Both Fox News and CNN have said that only the    finishers will earn spots in their Both Fox News and CNN debates , though CNN CNN hold a second grouping of candidates who meet the minimum threshold of 1 percent in public polling but are ranked outside the top 10 . If based solely on the Quinnipiac poll , the next five contestants to make the top 10 , in descending order , would be : Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky , Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , real estate mogul Donald Trump , New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and either Ohio Gov. John Kasich or businesswoman Carly Fiorina , who tie with 2 % each . " Safe to say , the 2016 Republican presidential primary is anyone ’s race . With no frontrunner and identical numbers for the top five contenders , it the 2016 Republican presidential primary a horserace which can only be described as a scrambled field     at least so far , " Tim Malloy , assistant director of the poll , said in a statement . While Bush , Walker and Rubio have traditionally led most polls , Carson and Huckabee are newer entrants to the field ’s top tier . The pair joined the race during the first week of May and their The pair may reflect a    bump as much as it does any durable groundswell that will carry them The pair the GOP nomination . The Republican candidate will likely face Hillary Clinton in November 2016 , who continues to enjoy a huge lead over her The Republican candidate competitors in Thursday ’s poll . Her The Republican candidate competitor , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , who held his first campaign rally this week , trails Clinton Hillary Clinton more than 40 points . Americans , however , still say they Americans not find Clinton Hillary Clinton or trustworthy , character measures that Republicans see as a liability in a general election . Yet she Hillary Clinton defeats all of her Hillary Clinton rivals in     polls , defeating Rubio and Paul by 4 points each . Some Republicans perform much more poorly     Trump loses to Clinton Hillary Clinton a hypothetical    by 18 points . Quinnipiac surveyed 1 , 711 voters nationwide between May 19 and May 26 .
