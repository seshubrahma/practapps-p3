Sunday on CBS ’s " Face the Nation , " White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said to take President Donald Trump seriously when White House chief of staff Reince Priebus tweeted the media is the " enemy of the American people . "   White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said , " Well , I think you should take it seriously . I think that the problem we ’ve got is that we ’re talking about bogus stories like the one in The New York Times , that we ’ve had constant contact with Russian officials . The next day , The Wall Street Journal had a story that the intel community was not giving the president a full intelligence briefing . Both stories grossly inaccurate , overstated , overblown , and the intel community ’s total garbage . " the president added , " I do think the intel community ’s a problem . And I think that the media needs to , in some cases   —    not every case , John   —    but in some cases really needs to get the intel community act together .
