To protest Milo Yiannopoulos’ October 18 speaking event at Clemson University , a professor and a number of    students and   students respective organizations created the "   Event Committee " to plan a demonstration against the conservative speaker , according to audio recordings gathered undercover . [ I spent several weeks infiltrating the group of activists , a combination of    Clemson professors and activists from Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) . Students were caught on tape referring to Milo as " someone I would like to punch in the throat . "   The event falls on Milo birthday , which he Milo designated " World Patriarchy Day , " illustrated with pictures of Harambe , the gorilla whose image Clemson administrators recently deemed too " racially charged " to appear on campus .   My undercover audio evidence suggests that SDS is primarily working with Clemson Clemson Chenjari Kumanyika and graduate student A. D. Carson , the leader of the university ’s Black Lives Matter affiliate " See The Stripes . " Other organizations that were contacted to join the protest include Clemson ’s Feminist Club and LGBT club " SAGA . " The Clemson Clemson of SDS is composed of a small group of students and philosophy professor Todd May , who attends the club ’s meetings . Per audio evidence of a September 29 chapter meeting , Clemson SDS Dawn Lifsey said , " We ’re Clemson SDS president Dawn Lifsey to have an event planning committee that ’s just going to organize around the Milo thing   …      so we can Clemson SDS president Dawn Lifsey together with club , Chenj and A. D. "   Lifsey has stated that Yiannopoulos sounded like " someone I want to punch in the throat " and referred to the conservative celebrity as a Nazi . While also adding that she considered stealing the Yiannopoulos event posters and planned on vandalizing some of the flyers around campus , " I ’m gonna’ throw paint all over [ the event flyer ] or something . " Lifsey has also tweeted in response to the scheduling of the Clemson speaking event , " If somebody put a bullet in Milo ’s head I would donate to that person ’s bail fund . " On the audio recording of the meeting , individuals can be heard mocking free speech , stating , " I know why Clemson is Clemson [ the Yiannopoulos’ the Clemson speaking event ‘ freeze peach ! ’ " Kumanyika , the professor helping with the protest plans , is an outspoken Black Lives Matter activist and has been heavily involved in campus politics and controversies . He publicly criticized Clemson an outspoken Black Lives Matter activist Clemson Dabo Swinney in a viral article after the coach commented on Colin Kaepernick ’s national anthem protest . Kumanyika was also thrown out of a Donald Trump Clemson campaign rally for disruption .
