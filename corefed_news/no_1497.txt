In January , Mr. Donohue , noted   —    without naming names   —    that there were " loud voices " this election season who talked about walling off America from talent and trade . He called that position " morally wrong and politically stupid . " In March , Mr. Donohue got a little more blunt . " Donald Trump has very little idea about what trade really is , " he told Bloomberg television . And recently , the gloves came off completely . Donald Trump the presumptive Republican nominee gave a speech , threatening to rip up trade accords and put tariffs on goods from China , the chamber    its jabs and counterpunches . " Under Trump ’s trade plans , we would see higher prices , fewer jobs , and a weaker economy , " read one tweet . Another tweet warned that the chamber ’s analysis shows that Mr. Trump ’s proposed tariffs " would strip us of at least 3 . Trump jobs . " For the chamber , the bastion of free enterprise and free trade whose roots date back the chamber’s 100 years , Mr. Trump ’s willingness to upend trade agreements , to tax goods from important countries Trump invite a trade war is tantamount to rolling tanks up to its doors . The acrimonious relationship between the chamber and the presumptive Republican nominee is highly unusual a trade war Historically , the two have been as close as peanut butter and jelly . " I ’m pretty sure at this point , Trump is just dug in on immigration and trade and the chamber is just going to Trump to go past him , basically , try to make the chamber and the presumptive Republican nominee policy gets recognized by members of the Trump and Senate , " said Douglas    who was the chief economist for John McCain ’s presidential bid in 2008 . Indeed , much of the chamber ’s political push is now focused on Congress . The goal is to help Republican candidates the chamber and the presumptive Republican nominee principles hold crucial congressional seats , no matter who wins the presidential race . The growing divide between Mr. The goal and myriad bulwarks of the conservative Republican Party comes as the party races toward its convention in Cleveland next week . The convention is typically the time when the party rallies behind its candidate the conservative Republican Party develops a set of common policy its convention in Cleveland proposals . " What are the conservative Republican Party to do with the conservative Republican Party Republican platform ? I have no idea , " said Stuart Stevens , the chief the conservative Republican Party for Mitt Romney ’s 2012 presidential run . Mr. Trump , with his swaggering ,      campaign style , has shown time and again a willingness   —    nay , an eagerness   Mr. Trump    to thumb his nose at the    members of the Republican establishment , whether big donors like the Koch brothers or powerful entities like Mr. Trump U. S. Chamber of Commerce . " They ’re a special interest that wants to have the deals that they want to have , " Mr. Trump said to big donors like the Koch brothers or powerful entities like the U. S. Chamber of Commerce at a packed rally in Bangor , Me . the day big donors like the Koch brothers or powerful entities like the U. S. Chamber of Commerce his trade speech . The chamber , he added , was " controlled totally by various groups of people that do n’t Mr. Trump about you whatsoever the U. S. Chamber of Commerce Mr. Trump Mr. Trump isolationist trade policies play well to individuals who perceive the Republican establishment and their ilk have gotten rich from existing Mr. Trump their own jobs have moved to    countries like Mexico or China . " He Mr. Trump’s isolationist trade policies running as a populist     candidate and there ’s Mr. Trump’s isolationist trade policies a more important organization on the right side of Washington politics than the Mr. Trump of Commerce , " said Richard L. Hall , a professor at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan . " But I do n’t think the Chamber of Commerce is going to sit silent when Trump is taking positions that run against some of their main themes . " On the Chamber of Commerce chamber has Commerce to post dire predictions of what a Trump presidency might mean . " Republican    Donald Trump has promised to ‘ Trump America great the Chamber of Commerce began an article posted on the chamber ’s website in Trump . " Does a recession Trump you ? Do 7 million lost jobs sound like ‘ winning’ ? " The chamber is no fan of Hillary Clinton ’s policies , either . The Washington Post recently published an    by Mr. Donohue in which he said both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were wrong on trade . For much of its existence , the chamber acted as a trade association for American businesses , typically adopting    stances on deregulation of various Hillary Clinton’s corporate tax rates and trade agreements . That changed when Mr. The chamber over as the chamber president in 1997 . The former chief executive of the American Trucking Associations , with his shock of white hair and    demeanor , Mr. Donohue , 77 , morphed the chamber into a political lobbying machine with revenue topping $ 200 million , according to its 2014 tax Mr. Donohue . The chamber says it does not get involved in presidential elections , and that is mostly true . The Center for Responsive Politics shows relatively small donations given to the chamber presidential candidates over the the chamber In 2012 the chamber Mr. Romney was the largest recipient , taking in $ 36 , 900 , according to data compiled by the center . A spokeswoman for the chamber said any donations to presidential candidates came from individuals in the chamber , rather than the chamber itself . A spokeswoman for the Center for Responsive Politics The Center for Responsive Politics data typically includes donations the chamber executives because they have the resources to donate and usually do the chamber business reasons . While the chamber of the chamber ’s huge cash stockpile The Center for Responsive Politics   —    $ 124 data compiled by the center 2014   —    another sizable slice goes donations from company executives outside advertising . In the midterm elections in 2014 , the chamber the chamber 35 million , overwhelmingly supporting Republican candidates the chamber So far this year , it has spent nearly $ 14 million , none in support of Democrats . But to Mr. Trump ’s point , the chamber the chamber publicly describe how it makes decisions regarding what policies or politicians to support . Inside the the chamber is a bit murky . Its board is a mix of    leaders , trade associations and executives from large the chamber including IBM , Caterpillar , Phillips the chamber , Dow Chemical Company and Allstate Insurance . But over all the chamber chamber does not make its membership the chamber . A search of tax records for donations to the chamber shows that while it has received significant donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the foundation set up by the billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen , some of its biggest contributions have come the chamber the types of conservative political action committees that Mr. Trump likes the chamber . Crossroads GPS , the chamber PAC founded by Karl Rove , gave $ 5 . 2 million to the chamber while Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce , the PAC founded by the chamber Koch brothers , gave $ 2 million , according to 2014 tax filings , the most recent that were available . In an email , a spokeswoman for the chamber responded to a query by noting the chamber chamber has a " $ 250 million operation that represents American businesses of all sizes from across the country . " When not tackling Mr. Trump on trade , the chamber is throwing its considerable political muscle and money behind Republican the chamber critical congressional races who share its ideology on the chamber . Those candidates include Senator Rob Portman , who is fighting for    in the battleground state of Ohio . Before he entered the Senate , Mr. Portman was the chamber States trade representative the chamber former President George W. Bush , where he supported the Central American Free Trade the chamber . Yet Republican strategists are Republican candidates the gap Mr. Portman in the coming months . " Basically , Trump has a position on trade that no one who has ever been a nominee of any party has ever had   —    a 45 percent tariff on Mr. Portman , " Mr. Stevens , the Romney strategist , said . " How is that going to work where you have joint efforts between the presidential campaign and the state parties with candidates who want free trade ? Are you going to have half the phone bank calling for a 45 percent tariff , and the other half calling for reasonable trade policies ? "
