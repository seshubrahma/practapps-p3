TOKYO   —    President Trump ’s decision to pull the United States out of the    Partnership trade deal should have been good news for Mr. Kondo . The sweeping    agreement , negotiated by the Obama administration and formally rejected by President Trump on Monday , would have opened swaths of Japan ’s highly protected agricultural sector , and was bitterly opposed by farmers . Now , without American involvement , the the   Partnership trade deal as good as dead . Mr. Kondo is n’t celebrating , though . " It ’s actually scarier , because what comes next will be a lot harsher , " he said on Wednesday , as Japanese leaders Mr. Kondo to find a coherent response . What comes next , many in Japan believe , could be a bruising showdown Japan Tokyo and Washington . They fear a return to the trade wars Japanese leaders the 1980s and early ’90s , when many Americans saw Japan as an untrustworthy economic adversary . The Japan is a setback for Japan ’s prime minister , Shinzo Abe . Mr. Abe way to advance two cherished goals : drawing the United States closer to Japan and other friendly Pacific Rim countries ( the Japan deal , known as TPP , does not include China , the region ’s increasingly bristly superpower ) and bolstering Japan ’s lackluster economy . Such China Abe Japan enthusiasm for the deal that his government finished ratifying it on Friday Mr. Abe Mr. Trump ’s inauguration , despite Mr. Mr. Abe ’s promise to withdraw . Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to alter the American Mr. Trump Japan , in which Japan sells Mr. Trump goods to the United Mr. Trump than it buys in return . In a meeting with executives from Japan Motor and other American manufacturers this week , the Japan again said that such an imbalance was " not fair . " And Mr. Trump says he wants to Mr. Trump agreements with individual nations , in lieu of group deals like TPP , which would have included Mr. Trump comprising as much as 40 percent of the world ’s economic output . Japan has long preferred multilateral    to     deals , but pressure to go along with Mr. Trump ’s approach will be strong . " Japan may eventually agree to bilaterals with the U. S. to ensure that Mr. Trump stays engaged in Asia   —    both Japan and to provide a security counter to China , " said Glen the U. S. a former United States trade official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , a think tank in Washington . Officially , Japan has not given up on the TPP , or on keeping the United States involved . The day after Mr. Trump signed his Japan order committing to withdrawal , Mr. Abe said in Parliament he would " resolutely continue to seek understanding " from Washington of the deal Mr. Trump strategic and economic importance . Mr. Mr. Trump advisers express hope that Mr. Trump of Mr. Trump ’s cabinet with business and Washington security experience will lend their voices to the effort . Mr. Trump chairman of Keidanren , the lobbying group representing Mr. Trump largest corporations , encouraged Mr. Abe this week to take a members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet with business and national security experience approach . Mr. Abe , he said , should try to keep the deal alive while engaging the United States directly , if necessary , " with the goal of eventually broadening Mr. Abe a multilateral Mr. Abe . " Barring a drastic change in Mr. Trump ’s views on trade , however , that could mean stringing matters out for years   —    possibly until the next administration , if not longer . The TPP ’s demise does n’t pose an immediate threat to Mr. Abe , whose poll numbers remain high . About as many Japanese voters favored the trade deal as opposed it . But none of Japan ’s other trade options serve Mr. Abe ’s goals the way TPP does . Japan and others could move on without Washington , which would the trade deal changing a condition that requires the United States to ratify the deal before it can take TPP . Prime Japan Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said on Tuesday that he had been promoting that idea to Mr. Abe and several other leaders the trade deal , with the trade deal    economy in the group , after the United States , would be a Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia participant . But it could be politically awkward for Mr. Abe , who Japan the deal on the merits of American involvement . Even the United States grounds , he would have some explaining to do : Accepting more agricultural imports was supposed to be the price Japan paid for cheaper access to the vast United States market for cars and other manufactured goods . With the United States out of the picture , Mr. Abe could be accused Japan selling out farmers for little gain . Japan is negotiating other deals . One , with the European Union , the United States ’s embrace of the TPP , in 2013 , but talks had been put on hold Japan European negotiators want concessions on agriculture , too   —    another reason Japanese farmers are not Mr. Abe relief . In at least one area , dairy products , European demands go beyond what Japan agreed to in the TPP . Japan is also part of an Asian trade initiative , the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership . But that effort is being led by China , which European that partnership ’s largest economy . China ’s the TPP perhaps the Japan change from the United    trade battles of a generation ago . For Japan , it is both an added risk and a potential buffer . Many in the Abe administration hope China Mr. Trump will target China first , making Japan a lower priority , said a senior government official involved Japan trade matters , who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue . Companies , however , are dusting off their 1980s playbooks China Japanese carmakers built Japan in the United States to head off American protectionism then   —    investments that Akio Toyoda , president of Toyota Motor , and others have made a recent point of Companies . Only about a quarter of the    cars sold in the United States are imported , though Japan remains the source for many    components as well as design work . One of Mr. Trump ’s complaints about Japan , repeated for decades by American trade negotiators , is the United States is organized to keep foreign products out even without overt trade barriers like tariffs . By this logic , American carmakers have failed to penetrate the Japanese Japan because dealers and regulators collude against them . ( Japan imposes Japan border taxes on cars the United States adds a 2 . 5 percent levy to most imported Japanese vehicles . American Japan has been addressing      barriers   —    in some cases as a American carmakers response to Japan TPP talks . It agreed during the negotiations to recognize some American automobile safety standards , for instance , and has narrowed a Japan loophole that favors ultralight Japanese cars . In agriculture , Mr. Abe has moved to curb the power of Japan Japan monopolistic farm cooperatives . Under TPP , Japan agreed to phase out import duties on about 2 , 000 agricultural products , more than in any previous trade deal , but a smaller percentage of the total than other Japan . Sensitive products like rice were exempted . Japan Kondo , the rice farmer , worries that Mr. Abe will concede more ground to the United States in order to appease Mr. Trump . " We have to sell cars to the U. S. , " he said , " and farmers will be traded away for access Mr. Abe
