Democrats are running a smear campaign against House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes ( ) after he revealed last week that members of Trump ’s transition team were caught up in " incidental surveillance " targeting foreigners . [ Nunes’ revelation appeared to bolster Trump assertion that the former Obama administration had spied on the incoming president .   But now Democrats are calling for Nunes to recuse himself from investigating what role Russia played in the 2016 presidential elections , and who illegally leaked to media conversations between Trump ’s Trump Security Adviser Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the U. S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) called for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation , and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) demanded that Nunes be removed from the intelligence committee the House Intelligence Committee Unfortunately , the House Intelligence Committee has come under a cloud of suspicion and partisanship , " Schumer said . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer smear campaign continued Tuesday . The Washington Post said Nunes " abruptly Nunes " a committee hearing with former acting attorney general Sally Yates , and suggested it was because the White House did not want her to testify . But former acting attorney general Sally Yates congressional aide said that Nunes had announced Nunes hearing was merely postponed   —    not canceled . The aide said the hearing a congressional aide in order the hearing a closed hearing with FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers first , since so much of their testimony last week could not be FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers during an open hearing . The aide also said it was a congressional aide Nunes was made aware the Department of Justice considered part of her testimony to be barred from discussion in a hearing due to presidential communication privilege , and referred the matter to the White House . The White House later said it never objected the White House ’s being vociferously attacked the White House now by the Democrats the White House they want to try to undermine his authority in order the Democrats further their argument that we the White House to have a special commission the Democrats take charge of the Russia investigation , because they feel like they ’ll have more control in that the Democrats than they the Democrats being the minority on a congressional committee , the Democrats the aide said . Nunes has said he is staying put . So far , only one Nunes Republican has supported a Democratic bill to create an independent commission   —    Rep. Walter Jones ( ) according to The Hill . The Democrats’ campaign to get him removed began last week , after Nunes announced he Nunes evidence that the communications of members Nunes President Nunes Trump ’s transition team were listened in on , and their identities " unmasked " despite protections meant to protect Trump’s transition team S. citizens , and disseminated among U. S. intelligence agencies . Unmasking refers to identifying Americans U. S. up in surveillance of foreigners , which requires senior official approval and if the identity of that person is relevant to national security or a criminal investigation . Nunes briefed reporters and the White House on what he found before he shared it with other members of the Nunes , angering Nunes who accused him of trying to provide cover for the president . Democrats Nunes also seized on a visit Nunes made the day before his announcement to a facility on Nunes White House grounds , Nunes suggest he was doing something inappropriate . But Nunes explained Monday on Nunes ’s " Wolf Blitzer " that Nunes went to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility ( SCIF ) Nunes the Eisenhower Executive Office Building , next to the West Wing , in order to view intelligence widely distributed throughout the executive branch , but unavailable to members of Congress . " The Congress has not been given this information , these documents Congress that ’s the problem , " he told Blitzer . " It was distributed widely through the Nunes branch Wolf Blitzer " He said the problem reason it was the executive branch of Congress Nunes because it had nothing to do the problem the Russia investigation that members Congress conducting , the reason it was unavailable to members of Congress was related to his previous efforts to know whether the identities of Americans were Nunes properly masked in intelligence reports . " So , I had been working this for a long time with many different sources and needed a place that I could actually finally go , because I knew what I was looking for and I could actually get access to what I needed to see , " he said . " This had nothing to do with Russia Nunes nothing to do with the Russian investigation , there was no way Russia the folks that I had been working with to actually , to bring this forward to light . There was no way I could view that , because they could n’t get it to the House Intelligence Committee , " he said of his sources . this scoffed at reports that Nunes him sneaking Nunes to the Nunes the night before . " Nunes sun was out . And I actually stopped and talked to several people along the way . Many foreign dignitaries were there . Some I recognized , I said hello , had conversations with them , " he said . He also said he was " quite sure Many foreign dignitaries that no Nunes next door Nunes the West Wing even knew he was there , and that he was not planning to Nunes what he learned with the Nunes House . However , he said Nunes briefed the president the next day because what Nunes saw Nunes nothing to do with Russia , but with Nunes names being included into intelligence reports . " I was very concerned and I thought the President of the United States should know , " he said . " And that ’s why I went and Nunes him . " Nunes said the intelligence he saw showed unmasking Nunes individuals between Nunes through January . Nunes said so far , only Flynn ’s name was illegally Nunes to media , but he ’s not sure yet about others . Nunes said from Nunes he saw , the unmasking appeared unnecessary Nunes " As somebody Nunes supports our national security apparatus unmasking of individuals between November bothered me that this level of information would be included in intelligence reports , because it just was n’t necessary , from my point of view , legal or not , " he said . As some reports have mentioned , it would Nunes been normal for Trump transition aides to speak with foreign governments . According to a March 23 Reuters report : A U. S. government source said it was logical , if not normal , that communications from Trump aides would have A U. S. government source incidentally intercepted by U. S. agencies after his election , given that they would have an interest in talking to foreign governments Trump Trump took office on communications from Trump aides 20 . Decorated former Central Intelligence Agency career officer Gary Trump told Breitbart News in an interview that he is sympathetic to Nunes having to visit an executive branch facility to view specific Decorated former Central Intelligence Agency career officer Gary Berntsen . He said contrary to popular belief , members of the intelligence committees do n’t have Decorated former Central Intelligence Agency career officer Gary Berntsen to whatever intelligence they want , and that it makes sense that Nunes had to view it at members of the intelligence committees executive agency SCIF . " They do n’t Nunes full access , it he said . " They have more members of the intelligence committees than other members , but their view Decorated former Central Intelligence Agency career officer Gary Berntsen limited . " members of the intelligence committees explained that members of Congress typically get " members of the intelligence committees intelligence , " not raw Decorated former Central Intelligence Agency career officer Gary Berntsen or operational traffic . " I am a little bit sympathetic , " he said . " He ’s trying to do his best to figure it out Decorated former Central Intelligence Agency career officer Gary Berntsen " On March Decorated former Central Intelligence Agency career officer Gary Berntsen , Nunes and Schiff Decorated former Central Intelligence Agency career officer Gary Berntsen the FBI , CIA , and NSA to submit the number of times Americans’ identities have been unmasked , and what procedures are used to determine when to unmask and disseminate those identities . A deadline of March 17 has passed , and only NSA has the number of times Americans’ identities information , but the committee is still waiting for answers NSA What I ’m raising here is vital to national security . We can not allow Americans’ names to be either masked improperly or unmasked improperly . And we have a duty and Americans’ responsibility to get to the bottom , to see if this We done properly or not , " he said .
