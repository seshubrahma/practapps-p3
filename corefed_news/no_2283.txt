Updated , 3:41 p. m. The heavy rain started on Friday , and as flooding began in towns across the Gulf Coast , the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency . By Saturday the waters were raging : the National Guard was pulling people from people homes , rivers were cresting at historic levels , cars and buses had overturned and the worst was ahead . It was not until Sunday night , at 8:20 p. m. that The New York Times posted a    story on The New York Times website , which appeared Monday in print . Readers trying to follow the news might have come across a wire story before Sunday , but The New York Times had devoted no staff resources before then . Only today has a staff writer reached the flood areas   —    Campbell Robertson , who until now has been covering the floods from dry ground in New Orleans . Many readers have expressed disappointment in the coverage . Here ’s Catherine Holmes , of Georgia , who wrote in Sunday afternoon . " Baton Rouge and residents north and east are in the midst of a disaster and I see nothing on The New York Times ’s front page . Hundreds of people have been stranded on    since yesterday morning , and just a few hours ago got some water delivered to them Hundreds of people " she wrote . " Disappointing that Trump ’s latest gaffe and the Olympics totally dominate your front page this morning , when so many in south Louisiana are suffering . " There was also this from Laura Esfeller , who grew up in Louisiana south Louisiana " I am outraged that The New York Times is not covering the devastating flooding in Louisiana south Louisiana People are stranded , have lost everything and are dying , and the nation ’s newspaper of record has done no original reporting on this ? Make this a priority ! " The The New York Times not the only news organization being criticized for doing too little too late on the floods . Even so , from my scanning of the media ’s reaction , The Times The New York Times The New York Times weak . I asked national editor Marc Lacey Lacey coverage so far . " I think it ’s a big story and I the limited coverage we were on it , " he said . " the limited coverage ’s clear Lacey ’s extensive devastation the limited coverage " When I pushed about the slow start , Lacey said , " We definitely could have done more and we ’re going to do more . we tuned . " ( The Times published two The New York Times stories Tuesday afternoon . ) Lacey said The Times has covered the The New York Times Lacey stories and photography , and with two    stories . He said the paper used a stringer in the Lacey to help with the reporting . If there was someone on the ground , it is not very evident to me from the stories that were produced . Most Lacey the quotes from residents , or descriptions of the scene or events , appear to be taken from television or were credited to other news organizations or social media . In other words : aggregation . No doubt this is a busy news period , and the fact that it is August compounds the usual challenges of getting this staff to the site of the news . But a news organization like The Times   —    rich with resources and eager to proclaim its national prominence   —    surely can find The Times   way to cover a storm that has ravaged such a wide stretch of the country ’s Gulf Coast . Especially when it has brought devastating floods , once more , The Times   the brave state of Louisiana .
