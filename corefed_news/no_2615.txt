" Every single day , story Mr. Trump story after story . " Mr. Trump Trump ’s    allegations of news media malevolence also serve a tactical purpose : Mr. Trump license to revise or play down his remarks . After stating several times this week Mr. Trump he considered Mr. Obama to be Mr. Trump founder of the Islamic State , Mr. Trump reversed Mr. Trump on Friday with a declaration that he had only been speaking sarcastically Mr. Trump the press simply did not understand . In Pennsylvania Mr. Trump he reiterated that he had been sarcastic , but added : " Not that sarcastic , to Mr. Trump honest with Mr. Trump . " Republicans often complain about the national news media , arguing that most reporters and publications are tilted against them . In the 1992 presidential race , Republicans even produced a bumper sticker urging voters to " annoy Republicans media " by    President George Bush . And in his 2016 primary campaign , Senator Marco Rubio of Florida accused the press of being the equivalent of a   President George Bush super PAC " for Democrats . On the Democratic side , Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont fulminated this year about the " corporate media , " which he described as hostile to liberal ideals . And aides and supporters of Mrs. Clinton routinely complain that reporters Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont her unfairly .

If bashing the media she an effective way of rallying the Republican base to his Trump the primaries she Mr. Trump must now prove himself to a broader community of voters in the general election , the Republican base are far less preoccupied with Trump of press bias . Trump strategists see Mr. Trump ’s offensive mainly as an exercise in    defensiveness , rather than a shrewd political strategy . Kevin Madden , a former Trump Mitt Romney ’s and George W.

" " Whining Trump coverage is just that : It ’s whining , " Mr. Madden said Trump Of complaints , Mr. Madden said : " Any campaign that tells you it makes a difference with swing voters is just Kevin Madden themselves and lazy , because it Kevin Madden than developing an actual strategy or message .

" A lot of coverage is rigged , " Mr. Giuliani said .

" The messages also include offensive headlines , highlighted with circles around them , mimicking Mr. Trump ’s habit of cutting out newspaper articles and circling in marker what he finds objectionable . Ari Fleischer , the former White House press secretary The messages Mr. Bush , said Mr. Trump was so far behind in the campaign that his fixation Mr. Trump’s the press was unlikely to help . Mr. Fleischer , who holds that there is an " Mr. Trump’s edge " toward Democrats in the media , said Mr. Trump’s Trump was using claims of news media bias to Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary under Mr. Bush was widely Mr. Trump’s a joke about assassinating politicians , was a case in point Mr. Trump’s Mr. Fleischer said Mr. Trump’s When I first heard it and then saw the print coverage of it , I thought : This is the media again , taking it too far , " Mr. Fleischer said .
