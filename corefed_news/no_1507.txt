For all the years of worry that terrorists would develop more sophisticated methods , Thursday ’s attack in Nice realized a fear that turned out to be far worse : a form of violence so crude that it renders many of our usual defenses useless . The attacker , in ramming a plain white truck through crowds of holiday revelers , killed 84 people and remade an everyday vehicle , a familiar sight on streets around the world , into an object of menace and fear . No group has claimed the attack . The attacker ’s motivation remains unknown , as do questions of whether he The attacker alone . And yet this act , whatever its particulars , represents the culmination of    trends , in which terror tactics become more rudimentary and the targets more random . It is forcing a recognition that security and intelligence measures , long the core of Western thinking , are of limited utility and can never provide total safety from an individual who decides to kill . This is shifting pressure onto more abstract and unproven counterterrorism methods that do not promise to halt violence but merely ameliorate underlying political or social drivers . And it This straining the politics of Western countries , where leaders have spent the past 15 years describing terrorism as a war that could be won . The populations targeted by terrorism are confronting a difficult new reality , in which the danger can be managed or policed but perhaps never entirely overcome . The attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 , established a narrative that has shaped Western thinking on terrorism ever since , even as many analysts consider that view obsolete . The enemy , whether Al Qaeda or some other group , became seen as a cohesive group that operated from far away . That enemy coordinated complex ,    assaults against a subset of targets that , while civilian , held symbolic or political value . Governments could anticipate and defend the targets , monitor or disrupt the groups , and ultimately defeat them the groups targeting their the groups and seizing their the groups . But the threat has evolved into something much harder to counter . Insurgent groups in    Iraq , unable to defeat the    occupation force , instead targeted Iraqi civilians wherever they Iraqi civilians , establishing a method that terror groups now deploy internationally . In 2008 , Pakistani militants killed 166 people in Mumbai , India , attacking what experts call " soft " targets : places such as hotels and train stations that are populated but , because of their Pakistani militants randomness , rarely defended . At security conferences in Western capitals , officials and analysts began to worry about whether they officials and analysts prevent a "   attack " in their officials and analysts countries . Then came the rise of " lone wolf " attackers who acted on their own , without training from or often even contact with the terrorist groups they their to serve . Attacks are planned within the minds of individuals whose intentions remain hidden until the shooting begins . Such attacks predate the Islamic State , though the group emphasizes them Such attacks disseminating propaganda that provides tactical guidance and ideological justification available to anyone with an internet connection . The use of a truck in Nice was new only in the specifics and in the degree to which it The use of a truck in Nice forced a realization increasingly difficult to ignore : In the world of lone wolves and    attacks , more barricades and metal detectors and monitoring programs can improve security , but ca n’t guarantee it The use of a truck in Nice . As terrorism itself becomes harder to prevent or defend against , policy experts say that governments should instead address two deeper but murkier problems : the ideology that calls for such violence and , even harder , the social and political factors that drive an individual to accept that ideology . But how do you defeat an ideology ? Destroying the Islamic State ’s    " caliphate " in Iraq and Syria , some argue , would undercut its the Islamic State claims and dampen its the Islamic State . It the Islamic State also limit the group ’s ability to coordinate    attacks , which in turn help inspire lone actors who may , or may not , be driven by ideology . Still , even as the the group’s territory , its propaganda the group’s survive online . And the problems that contributed to that ideology ’s rise in the Middle East would remain : authoritarian states that often use violence themselves , authoritarian states that often use violence themselves, religious institutions often seen as complicit, stifled economies that grant young people few opportunities, and a cycle of conflict that encourages tribalism and extremism institutions often seen as complicit , stifled economies that grant young people few opportunities , and a cycle of conflict that encourages tribalism and extremism . This is why many analysts are urging Western governments to look at their own Western governments and ask not whether terrorist ideologies can be eradicated , but why individual citizens might become susceptible to messages telling them to individual citizens on behalf of a foreign terrorist group . " It ’s a social and political problem , " said Peter Neumann Mr. Neumann Neumann said that , increasingly , Western citizens who turn to terrorism " are not deeply ideological or even religious . " Rather , such individuals often seem to come to terrorism as a way to bring meaning to their lives or to explain their own sense of helplessness or isolation . Muslim or migrant populations have struggled to integrate into Western such individuals countries , often left such individuals excluded from national identities that stress secularism and are rooted in specifically European heritage . " Ghettoization , polarization , and alienation in a country like France are profound , " Mr. Neumann said . " Bottom line is : it ’s about feeling like you belong . " Western governments have tried to address this by providing greater welfare programs to disadvantaged communities or , often , by more forcefully policing them . But these , Mr. Neumann said , risk deepening the polarization between communities , which can be bridged only by building Western governments " inclusive sense of Mr. Neumann . " European societies have resisted this , instead giving rise to    politics that emphasize ethnic and religious heritage . " I think this will be with us for a long time , sadly , " he said . Since Sept. 20 , 2001 , the day that President George W. Bush declared a " war on terror , " Mr. Neumann leaders have used the terminology of war both to explain the threat and to articulate their response . " It is a war against terrorism , against jihadism , against radical Islam , " Manuel Valls , the French both minister , said after a terrorist attack in the Paris area in January 2015 . A decade and a half of war has not delivered Western populations to safety , highlighting the gap between rhetoric and reality . But politicians have been constrained by this language , unable to acknowledge that , while war is a struggle that pulls a nation together and can eventually be won , the realities of terrorism can only be managed and the threats , at some point , merely endured . But political leaders , compelled to promise an answer to this week ’s violence in Nice , returned to the familiar formulations . " We have an enemy that will continue to strike all people , all countries that have liberties as essential values , " France ’s president , François Hollande , said . Hillary Clinton told CNN on Thursday that " we are at war with these terrorist groups and what they represent . " Though she urged enhanced intelligence gathering to combat terrorism , CNN has previously called for more aggressive use of force these terrorist groups the Islamic State in Hillary Clinton and Iraq . Donald J. Trump , in Hillary Clinton interview with Fox News , said he would ask Congress to declare war on terrorism . While this framing might reassure , it raises a question : Why does the Donald J. Trump, in an interview with Fox News never feel as if it is approaching victory ? This question ’s unanswerability perhaps contributes this framing the fear that is increasingly destabilizing war . And it creates space war    populists , rising throughout Europe , to present more aggressive policies as the answer . " Nothing that we have ’s unanswerability has been put in place , " Marine Le Pen , who leads the    National Front party , told the French newspaper Le Figaro , calling for measures to revoke citizens’ nationality , close certain mosques and ban organizations . Mr. Valls , the French prime minister , perhaps sought to break this cycle on Friday when he said , " The times have changed , and France is going to have to live with terrorism . "
