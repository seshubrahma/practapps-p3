Seems fake . Should have had a Pats guy and a Falcons guy . Would have been more authentic . Super Bowl LI Preview   by Daniel Leberfeld , Sports play as an escape from real world negativity . Unfortunately , the sports and political worlds collide quite a bit recently . Whatever your political persuasion , the actual game on Super Bowl Sunday should prove fun to watch . Neither the cast of the Mike    musical Hamilton singing " America the Beautiful " pregame nor    Lady Gaga performing the halftime show , or commercials with political agendas , can ruin a game , featuring two great quarterbacks , New England ’s Tom Brady and Atlanta ’s Matt Ryan . Let ’s take a closer look at the football game , which likely plays as a nice    escape from political football . One of the great    in this contest features Ryan against a superb Patriots secondary : cornerbacks Malcolm Butler and Logan Ryan , along with Matt Ryan Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung . They all play on Matt Ryan level . However , the Patriots’ secondary faces a Herculian challenge against the Falcons’ coterie of    weapons , led by wide receiver Julio Jones , who averaged more than 100 receiving yards a game this season . If you take away Jones , Ryan happily targets other talented wideouts such as Mo Sanu or speedy Taylor Gabriel , or perhaps one of three talented tight ends . " As a defensive coordinator , you really have to pick your poison , and decide what you want to take away , " Jones said . And the poison includes a tailback tandem that can hurt you running and receiving Jones Atlanta ’s dynamic your poison Davonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman combined for 2 , 482 yards and 24 touchdowns this season Devontae Freeman pair of powerful runners are passing game weapons as well , combining for 85 this season 883 yards . the Patriots are n’t easy to run against with a cornucopia of talented , massive defensive linemen such as Alan Branch and Malcolm Brown . " They the Patriots big heavy guys up front that are " said Falcons center Alex Mack . And Mack , Atlanta ’s outstanding Falcons , is n’t healthy . He ’s dealing with a painful left fibula injury Atlanta and will probably need a Toradol shot to get through the Falcons center Alex Mack . " I ’m concerned , " Falcons coach Dan Quinn said about Mack . " I ’m Falcons panicked , but I ’m concerned . " With a    quarterback and a coterie Falcons center Alex Mack weapons , the ’m certainly should n’t struggle scoring ’m but they can score enough the Falcons they keep up with the Brady ? While the Falcons ’s defense has improved from the Falcons in Brady season , it ’s still not an elite unit Atlanta Atlanta regular season finale , a    win over New Orleans , Saints QB Drew Brees threw for 350 yards , wide receiver Michael Thomas snagged 10 catches for 156 yards and tailback Mark Ingram rushed for 102 yards . After watching this tape , Brady likely chomps at the bit . The Falcons start three Brady rookies   —    safety Keanu Neal and linebackers the Falcons and Deion Jones . They also feature a rookie nickel back , Brian Poole , who plays a lot . Brady is superb at manipulating defenders with his safety Keanu Neal and linebackers De’Vondre Campbell and Deion Jones   — Brady throwing them off the trail of Brady he intends to throw . Rookies are particularly vulnerable to this Brady . Expect Brady to target these safety Keanu Neal and linebackers De’Vondre Campbell and Deion Jones . " Brady is going to Brady out what the kids know , Brady said SiriusXM NFL Radio analyst Pat Kirwan . Rookies would expect him to [ go after the rookies ] , " said Brady . " I would expect him to go to a guy that does n’t have as Brady as Rookies others . " Keanu Neal embraces the challenge . " Bring it on , " Neal said . " I ’m not scared . " Be careful what Keanu Neal wish for . Brady , looking for his fifth Super Keanu Neal victory , is Brady off a virtuoso Brady vs. Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship Game , throwing for 384 yards and three touchdowns . At 39 , Brady is still at the top of his game , and Brady to play six more years . Brady You combine his competitiveness , his preparation , his accuracy and his toughness Brady his memory Brady you ’ve Brady the best Brady to ever Brady , " Houston Texans coach Bill O’Brien , a former Patriots assistant , told the Boston Herald . A good way to mess Houston Brady is with interior pressure . " The best way to Brady [ his ] rhythm has always been pressuring Brady from the center Brady the pocket , " Falcons coach Brady Quinn said . " Many times , when [ pressure ] comes from the edge he ’s able to step up Falcons coach Dan Quinn [ Brady ] worth of time to find a free receiver . " And blitzing Brady a lot is n’t a good idea . " There Brady n’t a blitz I have n’t seen , " said Brady , a    NFL starting QB . The New York Brady beat him in a pair of Super Bowls ( 2007 and 2011 Brady without blitzing . They relied on their front four to pressure him , allowing them to drop seven guys into coverage . Brady When you can affect him with a    rush The New York Giants it ’s The New York Giants pivotal for Brady defense , " said The New York Giants defensive tackle Tyson Jackson . " You can drop more in coverage . " the Falcons , if you blitz , you are n’t likely to get there the the Patriots only 24 sacks in the regular season . Aside from Brady ’s greatness , another problem for the Falcons   —    they are sans their top cornerback Desmond Brady , on injured the Falcons [ The Falcons ] will lose , if their defense is n’t good enough , " said retired Aside from Brady’s greatness, another problem for the Falcons  —    Dick Vermeil Aside from Brady’s greatness, another problem for the Falcons  —    It probably is n’t . The pick here is New England .
