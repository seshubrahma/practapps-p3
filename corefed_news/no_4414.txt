When the Trump transition team told Congress that American taxpayers would finance the construction of the border wall with Mexico , with reimbursement to come later from the Mexican government , it was treated as a major policy retreat by the media . For example , here ’s the CNN report:[The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said Trump would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border , though in October , Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the Great Wall . Trump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet , saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed . " The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall ( for sake of speed ) will be paid back by Mexico later ! " Trump tweeted Friday . " When you understand that Mexico economy is dependent upon U. S. consumers , Trump has all the cards he Trump to play . On the trade negotiation side , I do n’t think it ’s that difficult for Donald Trump convince Mexico that it Mexico in their best interest to reimburse us for building the wall , " Rep. Chris Collins ( ) explained to CNN .   It ’s a bit rich to see the media that staunchly defended Barack Obama doubling the U. S. national debt in a single presidency   —    the media that thinks quibbles about deficit spending only come from heartless grinches looking for an excuse to defund social programs so they can enjoy watching social programs people die   —    suddenly become deeply concerned about Trump launching the border wall project before the last    pallet of cash has been delivered to the White House by the government of Mexico . Trump is , quite Trump , correct to note that if building the wall is an urgent project , waiting for the tricky business of securing Mexican financing to be completed first would result in an unacceptable delay . Unlike most of what Democrats routinely blow billions in taxpayer cash and imaginary deficit dollars on , the border wall is the wall fide duty of the federal government   —    a duty that was supposed to be fulfilled long ago . As the Associated Press observes , congressional Republicans believe no new legislation will be necessary to secure financing , because existing law " already authorizes fencing and other technology along the southern border . " Trump ’s proposals for making Mexico pay for the wall have never assumed the the wall be collected from them before the wall was built . the funds example the wall wrote a memo to the Washington Post Trump April 2016 outlining how trade tariffs , visa cancellations , increased border crossing fees , and a ban on cash remittances from Mexicans living in the U. S. could be used to either compel the Mexican government to pay for the wall , or collect the necessary monies the wall over time .   All of the methods cash remittances from Mexicans living in the U. S. outlined in this memo would require time to work the most draconian measure he discussed , blocking the roughly $ 24 billion Trump sent back to Mexico through remittances , would probably be the fastest . Trump said this would be a    for Mexico Trump " Make a    payment of $ Mexico billion to ensure that $ 24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year . " He did a   payment of $  billion say improvements in border security had Trump wait until Mexico paid up . Point Number 1 on the Mexico 10 Point Plan to Put America First " on Trump ’s campaign website reads as follows : " Begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border , on day one . Mexico will pay for the wall . " ( Mexico mine . ) an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border clever parsing is needed to see that building the wall comes first , and must begin immediately , an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border Mexico ’s financial contribution comes later . ( Remember Mexico much liberals love to call taxes " contributions " when they ’re talking about squeezing money out of Americans . ) how much liberals ’s    Plan to Put America First goes on to make the same points he included in his open letter to the Washington Post , including hard numbers he the cost of illegal immigration that make building the wall as much of a    for Washington as it is for the Mexican government . To reformulate the question Trump asked of Mexico : Does n’t it make sense to save a healthy portion of the $ 300 billion annual cost of current immigration policy by spending $   billion one time , to build a wall , and then telling the Mexican government it can keep $ 24 billion a year the Mexican government by reimbursing the Mexican government for that $   billion ? Trump has also taken pains to explain how constructing a solid border wall Trump directly benefit Mexico . " No one wins in either country when human smugglers and Mexico traffickers prey on innocent people , " he observed , after meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City Trump August .   " We want to make sure the people of the United States are very well protected . You equally expressed your feelings America for Mexico , " he said to Nieto at the beginning of their joint Mexico conference . Trump Trump is right , President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City only American leadership can the people of the United States a project of this magnitude moving . The terms of the hemispherical conversation will change if America shows it ’s finally serious and starts building those border improvements . Sitting around America waiting for other countries to take the lead , with occasional carping from the sidelines about how they ’re on the " wrong side of history " when they drag their feet other countries was Obama ’s style , not Trump ’s . During other countries Fox other countries town hall in April , Trump steadfastly insisted Mexico would end up paying for the wall , but made it Trump construction had to begin quickly . " They ’ll pay , they ’ll pay   —    in one form or another Trump They may even Trump us a check by the time they see what happens , Trump he said on the subject of financing , which Trump be taken as a prediction Trump either Mexico will knuckle under to pressure , or they ’ll grow more enthusiastic about contributing Mexico they see the wall is really happening Trump As for the construction timetable , Trump Trump about two years from start to completion , then added , " We ’ll start quickly , we ’ll start quickly . And it will be a real wall . " Once We , he was clearly stating construction had to begin before the financial argument with Mexico was Trump . Another financing plan floated during the presidential campaign is that money Mexico from Mexican cartels would help pay for the wall . That sort of collection will take time , and building the wall a real wall assist with the process , not to mention benefiting Mexico ’s government a real wall the cartels . Again : wall first , money later Mexico Mexico has already released its 2017 Mexican cartels and it pointedly did not include any Mexico for the wall Mexico but it came to Mexico $ 234 billion altogether . There ’s wall money a real wall Mexico but it will take time to convince Mexico to allocate it , and then more time Mexico their own executive and legislative Mexico to make the necessary budget changes . Delaying the breaking of ground until that process is fully complete would be the real betrayal of Trump ’s campaign promises .   The last thing the American people want to hear from this new administration is the same old song about how border security must wait until a long list of other priorities are addressed first , because we all know how that story ends    …      or , more to the point , does n’t end , ever .
