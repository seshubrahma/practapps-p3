Trump ’s speech :   Effective enough .   1 ) Reagan ’s famous    " The Speech " was all facts like Trump’s opening . Can be very effective . 2 ) Smart decision to implicitly praise Obama ( for putatively regretting appointing Hillary ! ) 3 ) " Americanism not Globalism "   —    This section kind of skimpy . Trump Trump’s to have chosen the more conventional     template . Not so interesting , but he Trump’s not trying for tenure . 4 ) " Things will never change " vs. " things have to change . " Auspicious    theme ! " The Democrats have explained the economy in various ways .    …     " 5 ) Hillary ’s " Terrible , terrible crimes "   —    a bit overstated , no ? Terrible judgment , yes . 6 ) Not sure I like the " I ’m the strong man who can defend you powerless people " posture . In a democracy , people are n’t powerless . Why not say that ? 7 )   " Abandon policy of    …      regime change . " Ca n’t say it regime change substanceless . 8) " Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens , especially for    and Latino workers . " OK , I ’m happy . But he ’m goes back to talking about violence . Would prefer mockery of    economic Polyannaism , like that of    …      Paul Ryan . 9 ) " Not alone any longer . " OK , that resonates . 10 ) Any sellout on The Wall just got a bit harder , 11 ) Visa overstay issue is important to Latino voters   —    i. e. it ’s not just the people ( mainly Latinos ) sneaking across the Mexican border who can bid down wages and take U. S. jobs . 12 )   " Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration .    …      Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty , mass immigration , and mass lawlessness . Her Hillary Clinton will overwhelm your schools and hospitals , "   !   13 ) OK , the Steve Miller section ’s over . Time to wrap it the Steve Miller section .    …      14 ) The promise to appoint " a person of similar views " to Scalia seems way more significant than Trump ’s previous list of judges ( a list that could be added to later )    15 : " I will fight for you . " Bob Shrum wins again .
