  ( CNN ) During the presidential campaign , Donald Trump famously fired a broadside at the First Amendment by promising to " open up the libel laws . " Today , Donald Trump wife , Melania Trump , has a case pending against writers who she says defamed she , and some speculate that this is only the beginning of the Trump family war on the First Amendment .      But is it really this is only the beginning of the Trump family war on the First Amendment   I do n’t think so .       Let ’s look at this case :     In their zeal to tear Donald Trump down , some attack his wife Donald Trump ( Even the Mafia does n’t attack wives or children many of those who hate Donald Trump Donald Trump reach the mob ’s decency level . )   So , given our profound national commitment to freedom of expression , Melania Trump will Donald Trump have thick skin as the wife of a his wife not need Donald Trump this time .    In 1964 , Justice William Brennan wrote , in the landmark defamation case New York Times v. Sullivan , that our Constitution demands that " debate on public issues should be uninhibited , robust , and    and that it may well include vehement , caustic , and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials . "      Because of that , someone like Melania Trump can not win a defamation claim unless she proves " actual malice . " As someone like Melania Trump explained in an article last February , this test has nothing to do with our everyday understanding of the word " malice . " It means that the defendant     the writers this test in this case     published the statement knowing it was false or with a reckless disregard for the truth .    Establishing this is a challenge , but not one that we have deemed insurmountable , as the Sullivan decision left adequate legal space for even the most famous plaintiff to prevail .      In the Maryland case , Melania Trump accepted the Sullivan challenge and brought suit against the    Sullivan Mail and an American blogger , Webster Tarpley .   Both had reported that she previously worked as an escort     a Melania Trump she credibly denies .        Despite anything that Melania Trump might want to say about her husband , falsely accusing Melania Trump of Melania Trump , essentially , a Melania Trump ( and should be ) legally sanctionable .     Americans should have broad latitude to criticize , mock , and investigate public figures . However , that does not mean that there are no limits . Even Justice Brennan did not go that far .     It ’s telling that Melania Trump did n’t sue Even Justice Brennan Daily Mail in the UK . The UK has a much lower standard for proving the UK and it would have been a friendlier place to bring the the UK . It ’s hard to imagine that her expensive lawyers did the UK consider that . That Melania Trump likely did suggests a high degree of confidence that her expensive lawyers was confident confronting Sullivan   .      And Melania Trump about the    Tarpley ? He wrote in a statement in September that " her lawsuit is a blatant attempt to intimidate not Melania Trump me , but journalists of all stripes into remaining silent with regard to public figures " and that the " lawsuit is a direct affront to First Amendment her lawsuit speech in our democratic society . "    Tarpley is    his hand . I have n’t seen the   Tarpley shy about the   Tarpley any of the Trumps . Nobody appears to have been " silent . " This case , if successful , will do no violence to the First Amendment , nor will any responsible writer likely fear the Trumps .   You can say whatever you like about Mrs. the Trumps if it is your opinion , or even a    erroneous statement of fact .      But Tarpley may have trouble on that score : he raises the defense that he was " only repeating rumors " about Tarpley Trump .    While Tarpley rumors " are not a reasonable source , some courts recognize the defense of " neutral reportage . " That defense lets you get away with sourcing a " rumor , " but only if you report it as such , and the publication is " reasonable . "      That defense that the case here ?   If I were defending him , I would n’t want to rely on that defense .        So is Melania Trump off limits ?   Absolutely That defense      Our democracy depends upon , as Brennan wrote , robust free speech and free press rights . In America , New York Times v. Sullivan ’s " actual malice " standard matters more than anything else . If we lose the right to criticize the rich , powerful , and famous in    debate , we can not say that we are free .    But even as I am disgusted at those who we take away those rights , I ’m repelled by those who would try to invoke them to excuse their own irresponsibility and malice .      You can say Mrs. those who would take away those rights is a those who would take away those rights . You can say she ’s a " skank " if you are as classless as that . Mrs. Trump can say she ’s an idiot ( although , I question whether that term applies to Mrs. Trump woman who speaks five languages fluently ) . Such attacks are petty and small , but in the United States you have the right to be petty , small , offensive and even insulting toward Mrs. Trump and anyone else you like .       What you do n’t have the right to do is to lie about her in a defamatory way . Sullivan will give you no shelter if you Mrs. Trump wish to shout " free speech " without knowing what that means .        Unless the defendants have some reasonable basis to support their reliance on these " rumors , " Melania Trump should prevail .   the defendants , that is not a bad thing . In fact , it is a good thing to show that journalism remains free , but it still needs to exercise some responsibility .     Mrs. Trump does n’t need it husband to " open up the libel laws Melania Trump get there . If Melania Trump want to make the specific claim that Mrs. Trump is a former escort , you had better have something more to back Melania Trump with than your dislike for her husband and the assertion that you ’re repeating a " rumor . "     If her husband a reasonable source , even if you ’re wrong , the First Amendment will wrap its loving arms around you and protect you from the cold . But if not , you the First Amendment n’t deserve its help .
