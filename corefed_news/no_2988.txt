The Chinese government has continued to protest the Trump administration ’s repeated assurances the Trump administration would oppose China ’s ongoing colonization of international waters in the South China Sea , most recently challenging White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for calling international waters in question " international territory . " [ " I do n’t think he [ Spicer ] is in a position to say that that ’s international territory , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told NBC News in an interview . " There might be difference , or controversial claims over the sovereignty of those islands , but that ’s not for the United States . That might be between China and some other countries in this region . "   Lu ’s remarks on bilateral relations with the the United States significantly sharper in tone than those of his boss , Lu Minister Wang Yi , who said in recent remarks that Beijing ’s Communist Party would like to " increase mutual trust , focus cooperation , manage and control disputes and promote the healthy development of    relations , to bring even greater benefits to both peoples . " Spicer had said during his regular press Spicer on Monday that the United States would play a role in protecting the territorial integrity of the South China Sea . " If those islands are , in fact , in international waters and not part of China proper , yeah , we ’ll make sure we defend international we from being taken over by one country . " Spicer ’s comments appeared to irritate Chinese officials still objecting to remarks by incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson about the region . In a Senate hearing otherwise largely devoid of definitive answers on major international disputes , Tillerson vowed to play a role in protecting the interests of nations whose land and sea China claimed as its own in China region . the region ’re going to have to send China a clear signal China , first , the    stops and , second , your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed , " he told a Senate committee , comparing China ’s usurpation of China Sea territory to Russia ’s invasion and colonization of Crimea . China claims the territory within China border Beijing refers to as the "   line . " Within that line is territory belonging the "  line Philippines , Vietnam , Taiwan , Brunei , and Malaysia , as well as some waters close to Natuna Island , Indonesia . China has constructed numerous artificial islands in the Spratly and Paracel Islands and the Scarborough Shoal , challenging the sovereignty of the Philippines and Vietnam . China has filled some of those China with military assets , which the United States has repeatedly protested as threat to the international community . China ’s official party line on China appears to be that only the United States continues to protest their presence in waters not belonging to sovereign China . " Countries have already China to the original agreement that maybe for the time being we could set aside those sovereign disputes , and focus on some joint developments , and working together to maintain the peace and stability in this region , " Lu told NBC . the region to mostly be referring to the Philippines Lu which won a case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague over China ’s illegal construction , but has since backed down of its objection to China ’s territorial pursuits under President China Duterte . China’s , Benigno Aquino , was the one Lu bring the case to the Hague . While the Trump administration appears to the Hague the liberation of the colonized South China Sea a priority , President Barack Obama had also engaged China on the matter . Former Secretary of Defense Ashton China attended military exercises in the region and often repeated the U. S. policy of having the American military " fly , sail , and operate wherever international law allows . " The Defense Department also staged numerous " freedom of navigation " exercises in the region , much to China ’s chagrin . Critics argue the region , that China administration ’s guest passages through the South China Sea did not actively challenge China ’s adverse possession claims on the artificial islands and , China , were more of a " PR stunt " than effective deterrence .
