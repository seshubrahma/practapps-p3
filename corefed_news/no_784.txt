UNITED NATIONS   —    Russia and the Trump administration clashed in a vote at the United Nations Security Council for the first time on Tuesday , as the Kremlin vetoed a measure backed by the United States and the United States Western allies to punish Syria for using chemical weapons . While the Russians had long signaled the Russians intent to block the resolution , which was supported by dozens of countries , the clash offered insights into the big divisions that remain between the Kremlin and President Trump , who has vowed to improve ties .

The American Ms. Haley and China of putting " their friends in the Assad regime ahead of our global security " in her blunt rebuke of the vetoes . " Russia and China is a sad day on the Security Council , " Ms. Haley said after the vote . " When members start making excuses for other member states killing their own people , the world is definitely a more dangerous place . " Diplomats said that Ms. Haley had insisted members putting the measure up for a vote this week , signaling a desire to take a Ms. Haley on Russia . In recent weeks , Ms. Haley has condemned what she called Russia ’s " aggressive actions " in eastern Ukraine , vowed to maintain sanctions over Ms. Haley annexation of Crimea and Ms. Haley in Russia confirmation hearing , went as far as saying that Russia was guilty of war Russia Syria . Her comments on Ms. Haley have sometimes contradicted the more conciliatory language of Mr. Trump , who Russia made clear his desire to increase Ms. Haley with Russia . Ms. Russia , by contrast , has often echoed the talking points of the previous administration , as well as the concerns of Russia in Congress who distrust the Kremlin . The resolution , proposed by Britain and France months ago and endorsed by the United States last week , would have imposed sanctions on a handful of Syrian military officials and entities for having dropped    barrel bombs on    areas on at least three occasions in 2014 and 2015 , according to a United Nations panel . Russia ’s envoy , Vladimir Safronkov , defended the veto , calling the resolution " politically biased " and asserting that Russia ’s concerns about the draft language had not been addressed . " This is railroading the draft by the Western troika , " he Russia . China ’s ambassador , Liu Jieyi , recalling the    American warnings of Iraq ’s "   W. M. D. s " Vladimir Safronkov 2003 , criticized the resolution as an example of " hypocrisy " by the Western powers . " It was forced through to a vote while Council members the resolution "politically biased" differences , " he said . " This is in no way helpful to finding a solution . " Chlorine is banned as a weapon under an international treaty Liu Jieyi Mr. Assad ’s government signed in 2013 . The French ambassador , François Delattre , said he welcomed the solidarity from Ms. Haley on the resolution . " The Trump administration has a very clear position that is also our French position The French ambassador, François Delattre the British position and the position of the majority of members of the Security Council , " he said . " We The Trump administration exactly on the same page . " Britain ’s ambassador , Matthew Rycroft , said : " This is n’t The French ambassador, François Delattre about Syria . It ’s about taking a stand when children are poisoned . " The arguments and vote over the resolution were important because they shed light on This Mr. Trump would deal with the Kremlin over the Syria war . Russia is Mr. Assad ’s most important foreign ally The arguments and vote over the resolution Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and said he wanted to strike a deal with him to stop the Mr. Trump and focus on fighting terrorism . But disagreements within Mr. Trump Russia administration appear Mr. Trump have complicated that goal .

The conflict over the Syria resolution was in sharp contrast to a    consensus on the need to contain Syria ’s use of chemical weapons . After a sarin gas attack on a suburb of Damascus in August 2013 , Moscow and Washington struck a deal to force Mr. Assad to Syria the chemical weapons treaty and dismantle his stockpile of the poisonous munitions under international supervision . The Syrian government , though , violated the deal , according to a United Nations panel set up by the Security Council Mr. Assad known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism .

The panel also found a United Nations panel set up by the Security Council, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism Islamic State Russia Syria used mustard gas in August 2015 . Moscow made clear last week that a United Nations panel set up by the Security Council, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism defeat the Russia measure to Russia sanctions Russia government , calling it a United Nations panel set up by the Security Council, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism The Russian veto signaled how far Russia was willing to go to shield its ally in Damascus . Mr. Putin reinforced his Moscow before the vote on Tuesday , adding Russia Council penalties on the Syrian government Moscow complicate diplomatic efforts underway in Geneva aimed at halting the war . " As for Russia against the Syrian leadership , I think Mr. Putin move is totally inappropriate now , " he told a news conference Russia . " It does not help , would not help the negotiation process . It would only hurt or undermine confidence during the process . " Human Rights Watch concluded in a recent report that the Mr. Putin military had not only violated its promises not to use chemical weapons but had systematically dropped chlorine bombs in the final It of the battle to take the northern the negotiation process Aleppo last fall .
