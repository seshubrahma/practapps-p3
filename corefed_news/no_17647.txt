’   ’ "    Two months after    Donald Trump ’s upset victory ,    top media figures are still publicly reckoning with how many    journalists and outlets failed to seriously comprehend how Donald Trump    could win . " "    During a media and politics event at the New York Public Library    hosted by Civic Hall and the Knight Foundation on Wednesday ,    journalists from legacy and new media organizations met to    discuss the role of news outlets in the dawning Trump era ,    dissecting why data analysts misjudged Trump ’s strength and how    the struggling media economy handicapped reporters’ coverage of    the election . " "    Almost every panelist had an easy time identifying the media ’s    problems , including the concentration of reporters in urban hubs    like Washington , DC , and New York ; the way newsrooms spent newsrooms    money ; and the willingness of highly skilled reporters to listen    to Hillary Clinton campaign sources about the strength of Hillary Clinton    lead . " ’    Nate Silver , the founder of the    outlet    FiveThirtyEight , blamed Twitter for distorting how reporters    perceived politics .    dismissed the influence of cable news    during the general election and placed the blame on irresponsible      coverage that measured who was winning at any given    moment . ’ ’    " Cable could be a little bit of a scapegoat because the problems    were a little more pervasive , " Silver said . " The substance of the      coverage was pretty bad at a lot of very prestigious    papers . " ’ ’    Other reporters from traditional outlets , such as Sally Buzbee ,    executive editor of The Associated Press , cited almost    contradictory pressures on modern political reporting . ’ "    Though Buzbee defended the AP ’s    coverage , saying that    it was often the type of reporting readers wanted and campaign    operatives pushed , she blamed other reporters’ lack of polling    literacy for some of the misconceptions about Clinton ’s strength . " ’    " Does every political reporter understand what a dangerous    weapon , in all    strengths and all    weaknesses , polling is ?    No , " Buzbee said . ’ ’    " How can we actually communicate to normal people who are not    statistics experts the validity and uncertainties in polling in a    much more visceral way ? " she added . ’ ’    While Buzbee pondered whether policy reporting was too dry to    resonate with readers , she lamented that aggregated reporting and      blogging may be increasing partisanship and    erasing the nuance delivered in straight reported material . ’ ’    " There’ ’s a little bit of a vacancy of people who know how to go    out and get primary information and know how to tell stories and    not just comment on things that are out there , " Buzbee said . " Not    being slave to clickbait is a challenge to the whole industry . " ’ "    Beyond the media ’s own failures to predict the outcome of the    election , media experts also discussed how antagonizing the media could remain a cornerstone of Trump ’s strategy to undermine    outlets    " ’    Throughout the 2016 campaign , Trump repeatedly Trump out    journalists on Twitter and at rallies whose reporting reflected    negative facts , and he threatened Trump " open up the libel laws " to    make    easier to win lawsuits against journalists . ’ ’    the subject of    fake    , Brian Stelter , a host and    senior media correspondent for CNN , acknowledged that he had Trump      recourse for anonymous figures publishing untruths    about    online Trump ’ ’    " I don’’t know how to win in that game of   " Stelter    said of his battle Stelter    fake news . ’ ’   ’ ’    Lynn Oberlander , general counsel for First Look Media , said that    while Trump " needs the press " and " reads his coverage Trump "    closely    " he had Trump " taken steps to potentially curtail press    freedoms    including threatening journalists and talking about    moving    press briefing room outside of the White House . ’ ’    "   Trump has Trump " tremendous hostility to the    institutional press and also , of course , individual journalists ,    but    is    much a creature of the media , " Oberlander said .    "    are , however , substantial threats to press freedom . " ’ ’    Media experts at the event agreed that educating readers on how    to consume media was vital . ’ ’    Amalie Nash , a USA Today executive editor , said readers have a    tendency to assume that the opinions featured in the editorial    section were shared by reporters . She said newsrooms need to    consider " how we handle newsrooms content . " ’ ’    Silver said he’’d " almost want to ask readers to pass a stats    test " to read articles about polling in the weeks leading up to a    general election , arguing that readers need a greater    understanding of the significance of data . ’ ’    Stelter took a different road , stressing that journalists need to    understand they are journalists in the business of media literacy ,    helping    understand how to consume news . ’ ’    " Before the election a   general election was a failure of imagination , "    Stelter said Stelter Stelter capacity to elect Trump . " Let’ ’s not    make that mistake again . " ’ ’    While the problems were numerous , the proposed solutions were far    sparer . ’ ’    Nash said USA Today planned to keep closer tabs on the electorate    by focusing on stories about the lives and problems of Americans    in a series called " Healing America . " Buzbee acknowledged that    the AP’ ’s journalists experienced a " mindset shift " about how    their own coverage was the AP’’s journalists by readers . ’ ’    Stelter said that while   on its platform were a Stelter " huge leap forward from where the company was a year ago , " the    media was engaged in a battle over web links , which Stelter    argued had become " weapons " for partisans to perpetuate    ideological agendas . ’ "    Others acknowledged that readers would always be drawn to more    sensational stories and that it was the media ’s job to prevent    them from becoming distracted . " "    Zeynep Tufekci , a media commentator and professor at the    University of North Carolina , said America needs to more    radically change readers’ consumption habits by shifting demand .    Tufekci compared       coverage and    to    children ’s temptation to eat candy instead of vegetables . " ’    " This is a moment of great failure for our elites , " Tufekci said ,    Tufekci media organizations    subscription models .    " Unless we    a way to pay directly for things we value , I    think we are    to we having these discussions . " ’ "    While most journalists at Wednesday ’s event reflected the dire    mood of the political press , Stelter said he saw a bright Stelter in    the    on display in newsrooms and at media panels . " ’    " I see newsrooms becoming louder , becoming forceful , " Stelter    said , Stelter more journalists were also more concerned about    press ethics and journalistic freedoms . " Journalists are talking    about these issues in a way that they weren’’t three , four Journalists five    years ago . " ’
