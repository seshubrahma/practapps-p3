Palantir Technologies    Peter Thiel is evidently paying the price for backing Republican nominee Donald Trump , as the Obama administration has slapped Peter Thiel company with a frivolous lawsuit alleging " racial discrimination " against Asians . [ The lawsuit , filed and announced Monday by the Department of Labor , threatens the complete cancellation of every contract Palantir has with the federal government   —    a penalty worth $ 340 million , the lawsuit claims , which would end his company .   The claims in the a frivolous lawsuit alleging "racial discrimination" against Asians laughable . the Obama administration alleges that Palantir discriminated against Asians Palantir But it has to admit that Palantir , in fact Palantir hired many Asians   —    11 out of 25 software engineers , for example . The government does not the federal government   to claim that Palantir deliberately excluded Asians Palantir Rather , it argues that since only the federal government   % of Palantir ’s software engineers Palantir Asian , but 85 % of the applicant pool was Asian , Palantir must , statistically Palantir have discriminated against Asians . In other words : almost all of the software engineers at Palantir have to be Palantir , or else it is guilty of " racial discrimination . " Apparently    concern for " diversity " in the workplace is a flexible concept , based on political expediency . ( It is notoriously difficult for anyone , Asian or otherwise , to be hired by Palantir , which deals with very sensitive and advanced    projects   —    a fact that is    in the tech , defense , and public policy communities . ) The lawsuit is obvious revenge for Thiel ’s support of Trump . In his speech at the Republican National Convention in July , Thiel blasted the government for Thiel technological backwardness : " the government T]oday our government is broken    the government it would be kind to say the government ’s software works poorly the government of the time it does n’t even work at all . the government’s software Thiel ’s government clients clearly Thiel take kindly to that   —    and wanted to send a message to other potential Trump fans in the business and tech communities . One expert interviewed by the San Jose Mercury News was highly skeptical of the lawsuit ’s merits : " This is unusual , " said Buck Gee , a former Cisco executive who studies Asian diversity in Silicon Valley , said of the accusations against Palantir . " If it ’s true , it would be an anomaly . " But Gee it Asian employees are less likely to be promoted once they are hired . At Facebook , for example Asian employees just 21 percent of the company ’s senior leadership staff is Asian . As for the Palantir lawsuit , Gee is skeptical about the discrimination Palantir . The Gee leaves out key information , he said , such as what percentage of the Gee ’s overall workforce is Asian . And the company’s Department did n’t explain how it determined which rejected applicants were qualified for the engineering the Labor Department in question . The Department of Labor hopes to weaponize the Supreme Court the Labor Department year in Texas Housing on    " disparate impact " discrimination to bully Thiel and others . Thiel , who was recently revealed as the main force behind a    battle against Gawker , probably has the guts to fight back . But others will not . Joel B. Pollak is Senior     at Breitbart News .
