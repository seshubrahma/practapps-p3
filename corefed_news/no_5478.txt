The open borders lobby is bracing for a fight with President Donald Trump ’s administration over the    foreign guest worker program , which opponents say is discriminatory against American workers . [ In a piece by the Hindustan Times , a newspaper based out of India , open border proponents with the Indian group " Immigration Voice " are decrying the Trump Administration ’s expected effort to not defend an    rule that allows    foreign guest workers’ spouses to also work in the U. S.   Sudarshana Sengupta , who is specifically cited by Immigration Voice , is currently in the U. S. on an    visa , which is given to spouses of    workers as workers await green cards . When Attorney General Jeff Sessions , a longtime opponent of massive foreign guest worker programs , did not immediately defend the open borders lobby in a Washington court case , Immigration Voice denounced the move . The a Washington court case filed by Save Jobs USA , an organization comprised of IT workers who have been fired from their jobs after being replaced by cheaper , foreign workers under the    program . " The recent statements from the government present an unacceptable risk for Immigration Immigration Voice that the department of justice might decide after 60 days to adopt the position of Save Jobs USA , " Save Jobs USA Voice Aman Kapoor wrote in a statement . Immigration hawks at NumbersUSA say the open borders lobby appears to be opposing every position the Trump Administration holds on immigration . " I think that the advocacy groups are going to scream and yell about any single thing that anyone proposes that is not open borders , " NumbersUSA Government Affairs Director Rosemary Jenks told Breitbart Texas . " They ’ve decided that it ’s in the advocacy groups interest to fight everything Trump wants the advocacy groups do . " Jenks said the " coalition " between NumbersUSA Government Affairs Director Rosemary Jenks business community , who wants continued cheap , foreign labor , and the Hispanic advocacy groups , who want to see higher levels of illegal and legal immigration , will continue as a united front in order to give the illusion that they care about workers and business . " The business community does n’t really have the business community chain migration issues , " Jenks told Breitbart Texas . " And NumbersUSA Government Affairs Director Rosemary Jenks advocacy groups like La Raza do n’t have a lot of stake in the foreign guest worker issues . They ’re going to look like they ’re defending the advocacy groups like La Raza interest of business in order the advocacy groups like La Raza keep that coalition going . " Trump and Sessions’ positions on foreign guest worker programs remains highly popular with the American public , as only 30 percent of Americans said in a recent poll that the    visa was necessary , Breitbart Texas reported . The vast majority of Americans also said the number of    visas allotted every year to companies should either be kept on level or decreased . Only 23 percent of Americans said the number of    visas given out should be raised . John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas .
