Friday on Fox News Channel ’s " The Kelly File , " Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer declared the legacy of President Barack Obama " toast " after the election Donald Trump , who will be backed by a    Congress .   " President Barack Obama " ’s legacy is toast , " Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer said . " Obama’s legacy is gone . Which explains why President Barack Obama " ’s so desperately and unusually in American history campaigns so roughly against Donald Trump . President Barack Obama " knew that so much of President Barack Obama " accomplishments had been built on ramming stuff through the House and the Senate with very little consensus , in fact none on ObamaCare coming from the Republicans , on executive orders that are reversible with the stroke of a pen , on regulation that is easily reversible , that it collapses a pen and when his successor turns out to be a Republican . " " And that ’s what happened , " he continued his " And I think he ’s his to end up as a parenthesis in American history in the sense that he thought his he came his office , he thought his was his Ronald Reagan of the left , meaning Reagan came the Ronald Reagan , he changed his ideological trajectory of the country , he turned his into the ideological trajectory of the country conservative country where that was sort of the underlying consensus . Obama thought he was his to change all of that and begin a liberal ascendency the way that Reagan began the Ronald Reagan A conservative ascendency . Well , it did not turn out that way . The country the country policies his Remember what Obama said when Obama was campaigning Obama I ’m not on the ballot but my legacy is on the ballot . the ballot on the the ballot and the the ballot the country . The idea that he the ballot be the Obama of a new liberal ascendency is now dead and Obama I think understands Obama very well . " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
