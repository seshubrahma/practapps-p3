Republican Donald Trump appeared on " Morning Joe " Tuesday morning , and with most polls showing the billionaire businessman pulling ahead in Iowa , Republican Donald Trump heeded the warning from conservative radio talk show host Mark Levin and pulled the billionaire businessman punches against the billionaire businessman closest rival Ted Cruz . Oh , wait , no Republican Donald Trump did n’t . What Republican Donald Trump really did was put on a pair of cleats and stomp on Cruz ’s face . And it was glorious .   To plant seeds of doubt in the minds of voters , or at least make voters fear a Birther controversy that could damage Cruz in a general election , the Republican frontrunner repeatedly brought up the issue of the Texas Senator ’s American citizenship . " If the Texas Senator’s American citizenship gets the nomination , day one there is going to be a lawsuit , " Trump warned . " And a lawsuit is going to take years to resolve . " The Donald was just getting started . " I think Ted ’s a nasty guy . Nobody likes Ted , " Trump added . " Ted gets a wacko like this Glenn Beck [ to endorse Ted ] who every time I see Ted is crying . Ted ’s very emotional . I mean , what a mess . " In response to a Cruz campaign ad , Trump blasted , " That ’s a lie . Cruz is a liar .    …      Ted ca n’t make a deal with anyone on the Senate floor . Ted looks like a jerk .    …      Ted Cruz more strident than Obama . At least some people like Obama Obama no one likes Ted Cruz " And when it was all over , Trump dropped the news that Trump will be receiving a surprise endorsement later today . Trump performance was brutal . Trump Trump Trump’s performance Most important of all , Trump ’s Trump effective . Trump’s performance this up on Twitter , Establishment    lose what is left of their pitiful minds , but thanks to a Twitter, Establishment    climate created by Obama ’s bootlickers in the DC Media , ruthlessness is near the top of my 2016 shopping list . According to the    Politico , Mark Levin and I are feuding over Trump ’s Birther Trump Cruz . I admire Mark Levin . I admire Ted Cruz . What Mark Levin admire , though , Cruz ruthlessness in a presidential candidate , most especially in a 2016 Republican presidential candidate . I did n’t write these rules . Trump did n’t write Trump rules . The DC Media wrote these rules . In these rules using surrogates , President Obama accused these rules of nothing less than murder and not paying his taxes for more than a decade . It not only does n’t Mitt Romney more ruthless than that , the DC Media loved and adored these obvious lies . That is as The DC Media politics has ever been , and the DC Media let Obama get away with it . Because the media is nothing The DC Media branch of the President Obama Democrat National Committee , Obama paid The DC Media price for falsely accusing his opponent of two felonies . And because that apparently President Obama n’t enough to drag a failed president President Obama the finish line , the DC Media finished Romney off by closing campaign 2012 with a heaping helping of a manufactured Todd The DC Media It ’s the DC Media ’s world , folks , we ’re just living in it . And if we ’re going to survive and prevail in this world , we must be ruthless   It    and Donald Trump checks that box like no other . the DC Media’s world less than we country was at stake in 2008   John McCain ’s willingness to lose like a gentleman to Senator AyersWrightRezkoPleger was no virtue . In 2016 , when no less than our country is at stake , losing like a gentleman to the          classified    foreign    tool of Wall Street our country , is also no virtue . And yet , the Republican Establishment has already signaled its willingness to do just that   —    to respect rules created by the media to defeat Republicans , to be the Republican Establishment ( like gentleman ) under a relentless wave of Todd   . On top of his ruthlessness , Trump also does something we have not seen in the last two presidential cycles : he attacks Democrats every bit as hard as he attacks his fellow Republicans . How refreshing would that be for a change Trump Although he has n’t yet accused anyone Trump a Trump , Trump fights like a leftist , fights like Obama , fights in Trump only way one can if you want to win Trump White House in a world where the DC Media allows its chosen candidates to falsely accuse another of murder .
