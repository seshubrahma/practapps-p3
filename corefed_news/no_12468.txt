Former U. S. Navy SEAL officer and founder of Blackwater USA Erik Prince told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon in speaking of the recent attack in Nice , France , " This is a war against their paradigm . This is a war against Islamic fascism . their are at war with us . us are clearly not at war with their . My question to France is , where is your Charles Martel ? Where is the guy that stops a Muslim radical invasion ?    …      Where is that kind of French leadership ? " [ As for the world looking to the United States for leadership , Prince said , " Unfortunately , I think they ’re going to have to wait till January and hope Mr. Trump is elected because , clearly , our generals do n’t have a stomach for a fight . our President does n’t have a stomach for a fight , and the terrorists , the fascists , are winning . "   Prince faulted U. S. military leaders in Afghanistan for not pushing back forcefully against Obama ’s " ridiculous rules of engagement " and said " we should be done with fighting      police measures    …      and actually fight and engage in combat and destroy the enemy . " Prince also completely supported Newt Gingrich ’s recent call to test Muslims in America to see if Muslims in America are supportive of sharia law . " This truck attack proves that the jihadists do n’t need weapons , that gun control is a false argument in the United States . This is the same thing that Chinese Islamic terrorists did in Beijing a couple of years ago , driving a truck through Tiananmen Square , doing the exact same thing , "   Prince added .
