Politicians encourage hate crimes by discussing Brexit , and formally triggering the process will bring    attacks to " another level " MPs have been told . [ Polish community leaders claimed the aspects of Britain that migrants like best , its " culture of tolerance " and " diversity " have been shattered since the Brexit vote because people have been emboldened to carry out verbal and physical attacks against migrants .   " Every statement and every political activity around Brexit negotiations brings a spike in inquiries to our organisation . We expect when article 50 is triggered article 50 will bring another level of discontent , " Ms. Drozdowicz told the Commons Home Affairs Committee . Ms. Drozdowicz fingered criticism of mass migration as a driver of ‘ hate’ in response to a question by fierce Remain campaigner Chuka Umunna . The Labour MP pointed to " Leave . EU , UKIP obviously " when he asked the EERC director whether she believes the " Leave The Labour MP " and    figures " the EERC director a responsibility " for    attacks . " The campaign was built on controlling migration . ‘ Controlling migration’ is not a neutral term , " she told MPs . When Conservative David Burrowes noted that most the EERC director of ‘ hate’ are expressed online , community leaders admitted they ’ve neither seen nor had reports of content on the community leaders that ’s abusive to migrants from Europe . Tadeusz Stenzel , the chair of trustees at the Federation of Poles in Great Britain , suggested there might be a language barrier which prevents European migrants from being able to understand abusive posts and report them . MPs heard that European migrants began reporting ‘ hate abusive posts in around April of last year as the referendum campaign got into gear , but that only after Britons voted to leave the European Union ( EU ) was the resource centre inundated with an " explosion of calls " . Ms. Drozdowicz said migrants from Eastern Europe reported being told to " go home " and hearing ‘ casual hate speech’ on public transport and that the centre heard about violent incidents including a Polish child being beaten up at school . Chairman of the committee , Yvette Cooper , said the details Ms. Cooper the session were " appalling " . " Hate crime is appalling ,    and should have no place in our country , " she said . Heading the government ’s inquiry into ‘ hate crime’ in November , Ms. Cooper    the campaigns of both Leave , during the EU referendum , and Donald Trump , in the U. S. presidential race , of having incited hatred .
