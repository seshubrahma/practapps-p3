  ( CNN ) While President Donald Trump insisted Congress repeal Obamacare within President Donald Trump first 100 days , the legislation was rushed , according to President Donald Trump Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price , and that ’s why the Republicans failed .   But the recent setback will not deter the Trump administration , President Donald Trump said during an interview at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Tuesday with CNN ’s Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta . Price runs a department with a budget of more than $ 1 trillion dollars and more than 80 , 000 employees who do work that President Donald Trump said touches on " the lives of every single American . " The orthopedic surgeon     the third doctor to hold the secretary position     said The orthopedic surgeon    the third doctor to hold the secretary position     was visiting Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday to meet leaders at the CDC . The orthopedic surgeon    the third doctor to hold the secretary position     also gave a speech Wednesday about America ’s growing opioid epidemic at the National RX Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit .   " Recovery is possible for every single individual , " Price said in addressing the summit attendees . " America is not giving up on this fight . Surrender simply is not an option . The stakes are too high and the value of every life is too precious . " Price is part of the executive opioid commission announced by President Trump last month . When asked about what was at the root of the crisis , Price Price to a sense of   despair in individuals and lack of connection to community . " It ’s a struggle now that is being met with these powerful , powerful agents that are destroying lives , destroying communities , all over , all across the land , " Price told Gupta in a follow up interview Wednesday . Before becoming secretary , Price represented Georgia ’s 6th district in Congress and he becoming secretary to be visiting on the day his becoming secretary was up for grabs in what was seen as a litmus test on the Trump presidency . Tuesday ’s unexpectedly close election unfolded in a district that has elected a Republican since 1979 , including Newt Gingrich .   This week , it This week the most votes to a Democrat , newcomer John Ossoff , whose lawn signs urge people to " Vote your Ossoff . " He your Ossoff be in a runoff in June against Republican Karen Handel , a former Georgia secretary of state , who got the second highest number of votes . Asked about the election , Price declined to weigh in saying that he your Ossoff " told by the legal beagles at the Department of Health and Human Services " that he your Ossoff to " take that political hat off and put it that political hat the corner " so that ’s what he your Ossoff he your Ossoff done .    Whomever gets elected to Price ’s old seat will be one of the many leaders Price Price have to court if he Whomever going to successfully transform the American health care system he Whomever spent a political career railing against , one he Whomever characterized as " failing . "   From doctor to politician , Price Price first public complaints in the 1990s came long before he Whomever elected . He Whomever on the Georgia State Medical Association , a group that advocates for medical professionals .   Representing the the Georgia State Medical Association he Whomever Rotary clubs and church groups all around Georgia talking about how the Bill Clinton administration had " started down a path that I felt , along with many others , was not the right path to head . "   Price turned that message into a political career . He Whomever four terms in the Georgia state Senate . There , he Whomever the first Republican Majority Leader in the state the Georgia state Senate , bringing what his Whomever paper , the Atlanta    called a " Newt    sense of Republican partisanship " to the state House .   He Whomever in tort reform that placed new limits on medical malpractice complaints , voted consistently against access to abortion , and repeatedly demonstrated his Whomever values beyond medicine . He Whomever for a constitutional amendment that banned    marriage in 2006 and sponsored a bill to create a Confederate history month that did n’t mention slavery . He Whomever to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Georgia flag the Confederate battle flag against eliminating the remaining Confederate symbol from the flag , which Democrats questioned him Whomever in his Whomever confirmation hearing in January . ( At the hearing , Price said his contentious confirmation hearing in January " addressed all the concerns of the state and was adopted and supported by the state . ") When Rep. the state decided to run for the Senate , vacating his 6th district seat , Price took Rep. Johnny Isakson conservative politics and Price for reforming Rep. Johnny Isakson care to the national stage , getting elected in 2005 . In Congress , he continued to get a 100 % Rep. Johnny Isakson from the National Right to Life Committee and a 0 % rating from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund , voting against federal coverage for abortion and against expanding research on embryonic stem cell lines .   He also introduced a comprehensive health care Rep. Johnny Isakson of his own , the Empowering Patients First Rep. Johnny Isakson of 2015 , that expanded health savings accounts . It gave states grants to create pools a comprehensive health care bill of his own, the Empowering Patients First Act of 2015, that expanded health savings accounts    patients , rather than have expensive patients deemed " high risk " by insurance companies in the general insurance population . The legislation never made it into law a comprehensive health care bill of his own, the Empowering Patients First Act of 2015, that expanded health savings accounts said this week a comprehensive health care bill of his own, the Empowering Patients First Act of 2015, that expanded health savings accounts still likes the idea of    pools Price   Research shows , though , they are limited in their ability to help Research " insurance for Research , " as Trump said he wanted to do . A study from Trump Kaiser Family Foundation found prior to Obamacare , the states with    pools offered coverage that was expensive , and only a small fraction of the people who needed the coverage actually got it .    Price told Gupta that while A study from the Kaiser Family Foundation did not work " terribly well " Price the past , it ’s because they were n’t funded to Price " degree Price should be " and the pools were Price big enough to be cost effective . Going forward , the administration ’s plan would need to address this issue , he said . A    doctor , Price Gupta he will work to transform the Price care A   doctor to make it more " patient centered . " The the health care system said he knows this kind of Price possible , Price he witnessed those relationships first hand when he was Price little boy , making housecalls with Price grandfather .   " The door flung open Price they said , ’Dr . Price.’ and gave him a big hug , " Price remembered " ’Dr to me that ’s what the    relationship was all about . " In contrast , at Resurgens Orthopaedics , which Price helped build into a nationwide practice , he said the system prevented those kinds of relationships ’Dr   " I remember , almost to the day , the moment in my medical practice when I was back in my office working on some paperwork and I went out to see a patient , and I crossed , I went through that door , you know the door between the clinical side where you see patients and the    area , and it hit me that there were more people behind that door working on all the clerical stuff . that door fighting with insurance companies , fighting with the government , fighting with this supplier , that supplier , to get the services and the apparatus needed to care for those people , " Price said .   " I said to myself then , at that very moment , ’There ’s something wrong with this picture.’ When we have more people in the system who are n’t providing clinical care , who are n’t    taking care of patients or having a responsibility to care for patients , then that ’s a system that again , may be working for other folks , but it ’s not working for the patients . " Moving that after failure   The patients Republican attempt to fix the healthcare system failed , Price said , because of the a system for the sale of the bill . " While his boss said , " nobody knew health care could be so complicated , " Price seems to have understood and told Gupta that " the different systems Price we have , do n’t make a whole lot of sense . "   He vowed the administration will " keep our eye on the ball and his certain Trump administration move in the direction Trump administration a system that is much more responsive to Trump administration , again , those end users , the people and the patients across this land who need to be paid attention to , " Price said . Price suggested one way to fix the system will be to make sure the right resources go to the right initiatives .   He wants to cut redundancy and waste . And while he runs the federal agency that operates 11 divisions including the CDC , the He and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health , he thinks the states , rather than the federal government should get more power He your healthcare the government are much more flexible , much more nimble to be able to create and modify States system that would work best for their constituents , " he said . States may have to pick up the slack since States President Trump budget plan He billions from Price ’s departments , which have already seen shrinking budgets for years . For instance , a report from Trust for America America Health found that the CDC the CDC budget has decreased by more than $ 580 million since 2010 . Health as the CDC budget the CDC , state public health spending remained relatively flat . Money , though , is not the answer , Price repeatedly told Gupta . " For us to Price , let ’s just throw Gupta money at that system . Let ’s see if more money helps that out’ the health care system us way , " Price said . When pressed to us an example Price a state that has improved healthcare with less money , Price did not give a direct answer . Instead he pointed to Indiana as a state that reformed its health care system under the guidance of the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services director Seema Verma . Indiana The Healthy Indiana Plan did not do more with less instead , it used the money it was given for Medicaid to create benefit packages for    adults that were modeled after The Healthy Indiana Plan health plans . The Healthy Indiana Plan created health savings accounts for the poor that required most to contribute some money toward their own health care , even if it was only a few dollars .   Price will continue to push for reform and is Price the Trump administration will leave Americans with a better health care system .   " When we look back on Trump administration Price said , " I believe , in 10 Price 20 years , I think that we will say that we moved in the direction of a much more responsive , much more higher quality healthcare system for we American people , we I still believe that ’s what will occur .
