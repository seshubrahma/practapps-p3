On Friday ’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel ’s " Special Report , " columnist Charles Krauthammer stated that neither the audio of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s lewd remarks , or emails from the campaign Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s are surprising , since " If somebody had asked you , about GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump , do you think the campaign Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton talks like this in private ? You would answer of course yes . " And " Everybody knows that on every issue she has a private position and a public . "   Krauthammer said that with the campaign Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , " there is some devastating ammunition there , particularly open borders and open trade . " Krauthammer added , " None of this is surprising . If somebody had asked you , about Trump , do you think Krauthammer talks like this in private ? You would answer of course yes . But it ’s hearing it . This is what    evidence does . Once you hear it , it becomes information of a different order . The same with Hillary . Everybody knows that on every issue Hillary has a private position and a public . If they intersect , that ’s nice , but if it does n’t , that ’s the way Hillary operates . but when you hear Hillary say it , admit it , say it in a speech in public , it becomes evidence . " Krauthammer later added that the Clinton leak was done by someone who was waiting for Clinton to be the nominee , and whose " sentiments , at the least , are somewhat    or Republican .
