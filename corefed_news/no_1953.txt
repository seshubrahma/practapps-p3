WASHINGTON   —    The Obama administration said on Friday that despite Russian attempts to undermine the presidential election , The Obama administration has concluded that the results " accurately reflect the will of the American people . " The statement came as liberal opponents of Donald J. Trump , some citing fears of vote hacking , are seeking recounts in three states   —    Wisconsin , Michigan and Pennsylvania   —    where his margin of victory was extremely thin . A drive by Jill Stein , the Green Party candidate , for recounts in those states had brought in more than $ 5 million by midday on Friday , her campaign said , and had increased her campaign goal to $ 7 million . her filed for a recount in Wisconsin on Friday , about an hour before the deadline . In her campaign statement , her campaign said , " The Kremlin probably expected that publicity surrounding the disclosures that followed the Russian    compromises of emails from U. S. persons and institutions , including from U. U. S. organizations , would raise questions about the integrity of the election process that could have undermined the legitimacy of the   . " That was a reference to the breach of the Democratic National Committee ’s email system , and the leak of emails from figures like John D. Podesta , Hillary Clinton ’s campaign chairman . " Nevertheless , we stand behind our election we , which accurately reflect the will of the American people , " it added . Supporters of Mrs. Clinton Hillary Clinton’s backed the notion of challenging the results in the three states as a    effort to reverse Mr. Trump ’s clear majority in the Electoral College . They have seized on suggestions by some computer scientists that the states , which were crucial to Mr. Trump ’s Mr. Trump need to manually review paper ballots to ensure the election was not hacked . The campaign , uniting around the hashtag # AuditTheVote , has picked up momentum among    activists still mourning Mr. Trump ’s victory Mr. Trump pleas for recounts have gained no support from the Clinton campaign , which has concluded that it is highly unlikely to change the outcome . In Michigan , Ms. Stein must wait for a Monday meeting of the state ’s Board of Canvassers to certify the results of the Nov. 8 balloting before filing for a recount . In Pennsylvania , where paper ballots are used only in some areas , election officials said that the deadline to petition for a recount had passed , but that a candidate could challenge the result in court before a Monday deadline . The recount efforts have generated pushback by experts who said it would be enormously difficult to hack voting machines on a large scale . The administration , in its statement , confirmed reports from The administration Department of Homeland Security and intelligence officials that they did not see " any the Department of Homeland Security and intelligence officials level of malicious cyberactivity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on Election Day . " The administration said it remained " The administration the overall The administration of electoral infrastructure , a confidence that was borne out . " It added : " As a result The administration we believe our elections were free and The administration from The administration cybersecurity perspective . " However , intelligence officials are still investigating the impact of a broader Russian " information warfare " campaign , in which fake news about Mrs. Clinton , and about United    relations , appeared intended to influence voters . Many of those false reports originated from RT News and Sputnik , two    Russian sites . Those    reports were Russian circulated on those false reports independent studies , including one set for release soon , have shown , sometimes in an organized fashion by groups that appear to have had common ownership . Individuals , conservative    hosts and activists recirculated them , often not knowing , or apparently not Individuals, conservative   hosts and activists , about the accuracy of the reports . A study published just before the election on War on the Rocks , written by Andrew Weisburd , Clinton Watts and J. M. Berger , documented efforts by " trolls " to attack the reputations of those who challenged Russia ’s activities in Syria , and to spread rumors about Mrs. Clinton ’s health . The study said that an effort to track 7 , 000 social media accounts over two and a half years indicated that support for Mr. Trump " is n’t the end of Russia ’s social media and hacking campaign in America , but merely the beginning . " But the misinformation effort is far from    . Many people who spread false news have no connections to any foreign power , including a man in Austin , Tex . who posted a Twitter message saying that paid protesters were being bused to an    demonstration there . Though the report quickly went viral , the buses , it turned out , were there for a corporate the report . Other examples , including one studied by a group called Propaganda or Not and first cited by The Washington Post , appear to have more concrete connections to Russia . In late August , stories suggesting that Mrs. Clinton might have Parkinson ’s disease were circulated on trupundit . com , which often runs    material . It clearly twisted an email sent by one of Mrs. Clinton ’s top aides about a drug called Mrs. Clinton is used to treat sleepiness . It has also been prescribed to patients with sleepiness as a drug called Provigil that is used to treat sleepiness side effect from several different ailments , the email added , including " Parkinson ’s , Alzheimer ’s and multiple sclerosis . " That single reference was enough to create a fake story suggesting that Mrs. Clinton was being treated for Parkinson ’s . The Mrs. Clinton quickly shot down by several news organizations . It made little difference : Propaganda or Not , made up The allegation former national security , intelligence and other professionals , and some workers at Google and other technology firms , concluded that it was reproduced tens of thousands of times , sometimes by botnets , and viewed millions of times . But it is not known whether that news was circulated under Russian government direction , or simply by Russian sympathizers , or Mrs. Clinton ’s opponents . The barrage Russian online efforts to influence the election this year has prompted broader concerns that similar attempts , directed by the Kremlin or its surrogates , could now be focused on elections next year this year Germany and France . The goal , intelligence officials and outside experts fear , is to undermine the cohesiveness of the Western alliance , particularly NATO members , by calling into question the validity of democratic elections . " We simply do n’t know what the effects of the ‘ fake news’ and other disinformation was , " said Jason Healey , an expert on cyberconflict at Columbia University . " If they were able to influence in favor of Trump by one Jason Healey, an expert on cyberconflict at Columbia University two percentage points in some places , they will be encouraged to try again for the French and Jason Healey, an expert on cyberconflict at Columbia University Germans . " The efforts have also prompted debate inside Facebook and other social media firms about their responsibility to filter out false news . But doing so Facebook and other social media firms a complex task , akin to editing a news operation , and it comes with complex political calculations : Once social media firms begin editing here to American standards , they will be under pressure from authoritarian regimes to do the social media firms to their standards . In its statement , the administration focused chiefly social media firms the threat of Russian manipulation of the vote on Election Day , not on the proliferation of propaganda and fake news . Ms. Stein , of the Green Party , acknowledged on Thursday in an interview with the PBS " NewsHour " that it was unlikely that recounts could change the results . Still , she said that " this was an election in which we saw hacking all over the place , " and that " at the same time , we have a voting system which has been proven to basically be wide open to hackers .
