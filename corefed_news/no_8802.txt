On Friday ’s broadcast of " CNN Newsroom , " Symone Sanders argued that Make America Great Again " takes us back to a time when us were in slavery , when us were in chains , when us worked on plantations , internment camps for the Chinese . " Symone Sanders corrected the Chinese internment statement on Twitter , saying she misspoke and meant to refer to Japanese internment .   Symone Sanders said , " I do not think that every single Trump supporter is racist . But it is   —    us have to be real and understand that the populism around Donald Trump ’s campaign was intrinsically tied to racism . ’s campaign was intrinsically tied to making people that were not white    people the other . Make America Great Again takes us back   —    people that look like me , takes us back to a time when us were in slavery , when us were in chains , when us worked on plantations , internment camps for the Chinese . So , it is really , really important that if us want to heal , that if people want to get past , if Trump supporters want to say , well , why are you calling me racist ? That us have to understand that the populism was tied to elements of racism . And the last thing I would say is that racism is   —    a racist is   —    I think people think racism is dogs and white hoods and water hoses and the    and that is not the only form of racism . There are microaggressions . There are oh , I did n’t   —    you speak so well . These are microaggressions that are forms of prejudice and discrimination that we have to address . " Sanders added that just because a county voted for Obama , and then voted for Trump , " does n’t mean that just because a county voted for Obama, and then voted for Trump do n’t have elements of predjudice , of discrimination , of racism . That is the equivalent of saying I have a black friend . " (   Mediaite ) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
