Sunday on MSNBC ’s " AM Joy , " actor and director Rob Reiner called Donald Trump ’s White House " a cancerous presidency that we can not allow to spread . "   Rob Reiner said , " What ’s interesting here is that we really have a test , and we are being tested as to whether or not we democracy is going to survive . we have somebody who ’s mentally unstable , who is a pathological liar . There ’s no getting around that , who ’s running our country . " " And if we can survive this , that will strengthen we in a strange way , " he added . " What you ’re seeing all over our country with protests , I ’ve been to many of them protests is nothing like what I went through in the 60 ’s when I protested against the Vietnam War , this is everyone . It this not just people worried about being killed in Vietnam , this is everyone . And so we ’re looking at a cancerous presidency that we we not allow to spread .
