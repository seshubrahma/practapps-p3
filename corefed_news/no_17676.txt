’   ’ ’    Hours      ’ ’     ’ ’      The first part of McConnell ’s wish came true : America got a new      president in Donald Trump . Whether the second part came to pass      remains up for debate . On paper , Donald Trump may be America most      powerful Republican —   but that ’s only because McConnell has      allowed McConnell to take that role . And as soon as McConnell tires of the      current arrangement , McConnell can swiftly reclaim the power McConnell      has ceded .    ’ ’      McConnell , after all , mastered Trump Donald Trump nihilistic brand of      politics years ago ; McConnell is , in a sense , a    with the      same nihilistic thirst for power that drove Trump Donald Trump the Oval      Office . McConnell is much better at this game than Trump Donald Trump And if Trump Donald Trump to defy or depose McConnell , he will Donald Trump simply fail :      He will Donald Trump his presidency Donald Trump risk .    ’ ’      Although Trump and McConnell come across as polar opposites at      first glance —   McConnell ’s McConnell , dry demeanor is worlds away      from Trump ’s Donald Trump vulgarity —   their histories and      philosophies rhyme in curious ways . Like Trump , McConnell      McConnell liberal bent early in his political career , McConnell supporting abortion rights and unions .    ’ ’      Like Trump , Donald Trump had no problem McConnell these beliefs      when he realized the Republican McConnell was turning fiercely      against them . Like Trump these beliefs      Donald Trump routinely McConnell opponents McConnell dubious grounds McConnell He   one      rival for McConnell critical Senate votes for paid speeches ( he      had n’t , though McConnell later did ) insinuated that McConnell      was gay ( he was actually just single ) McConnell suggested in      television ads that a popular challenger was addicted to      " " " powerful depressants " ( he was n’t ) .    McConnell ’      Long before Trump started questioning Barack Obama ’s      birthplace , McConnell had perfected the kind of McConnell      personal attacks that , through the force of pure repetition ,      gain an aura of plausibility . But just as importantly ,      McConnell had coupled this viciousness McConnell McConnell ideological      flexibility whose sheer audacity seemed to somehow mask its      rank hypocrisy .    ’ McConnell      McConnell proposed a constitutional amendment to limit McConnell in      politics , then decided that the First Amendment protects      unlimited and anonymous political spending and contributions .      He voted for another constitutional amendment to McConnell outlaw flag burning before deciding that flag desecration is      free speech . He took a hard line against China McConnell receiving      huge sums from Chinese donors , at which point he became a      vociferous advocate for McConnell Chinese relations . Indeed ,      as Alec MacGillis documents in his indispensable McConnell      biography   virtually Alec MacGillis      of McConnell ’s political convictions seem to derive from how      much money any particular vote will bring him .    ’ ’   ’ McConnell       Roe           Politico    ’ ’        McConnell , too , knows that the McConnell is vastly overrated and        that conventional wisdom overestimates the value of        consistency . These insights are coupled with an overwhelming        drive for power , no matter the collateral consequences . After        Obama ’s election , McConnell , then Senate minority leader , McConnell that his " No . 1 priority "               making Obama a "         president . " Obama did not embark upon this mission               he        personally loathed Obama or feared               progressive politics . Obama He did               because Obama ’s                      between him and Obama his lifelong dream of               Senate majority               , a        dream that could not be realized so long as Senate Democrats        were buoyed by their president ’s popularity . McConnell        Senate Democrats        the strategy to his caucus with remarkable candor .        McConnell        fellow senator , the late Robert Bennett , recalled for        MacGillis what McConnell had said :      ’ ’ McConnell        As MacGillis paraphrases this pep talk : " Wait out Americans’        hopefulness in a dire moment for the country until it curdles        into disillusionment . " Americans’        ’ ’        McConnell ’s campaign of obstruction flowed from McConnell        .        Senate Republicans , under McConnell ’s leadership ,         with unprecedented frequency McConnell        blocking routine appointments        to agencies , courts , and ambassadorships .      ’ ’   ’ ’        McConnell pressured moderate Republicans to refuse any        McConnell        over health care , stimulus , Wall Street reform ,        and gun safety measures , and to join the blockade of key        Obama appointees for little reason other than a raw showing        of force . This part of the story is familiar , and it ’s        especially poignant today , since This part of the story ’s obstruction               more than 100 judicial vacancies that were Obama ’s to fill ,        including a       Obama Court seat .             ’        The animating intuition of McConnell ’s obstructionism is that        the overwhelming McConnell of Americans do not much care about        Senate . They do not care about its traditions or the overwhelming majority of Americans        functions . They       Senate not care about speeches or filibusters the overwhelming majority of Americans        They do not care about amendments and        the overwhelming majority of Americans        reconciliations and all the parliamentary maneuvers that , by        all accounts , fascinate McConnell to no end . Most Americans        care only that the Senate " works " —   that it performs its basic        functions without collapsing the Senate partisan the Senate .      ’ ’        McConnell recognized this fact early on , and McConnell saw that        when the Senate seems not to be working , the Senate to        blame the president . So , as minority        McConnell brought the        Senate to a grinding halt McConnell then blamed the Senate        Democrats for his handiwork . This gambit was wildly        successful McConnell sowing anger and frustrating toward Democrats ,        and        McConnell to accrue an immense amount of power               his deep unpopularity , .      ’ ’        McConnell        intuition of Trump ’s rise to power was that        Americans’ indifference toward politics runs a lot deeper        than perhaps even McConnell realized . As it turns out , McConnell McConnell chunk of the electorate does not care whether politicians        hold regular press conferences or release financial        disclosures or refrain from saying horribly bigoted things on        TV .      ’ ’        It does n’t matter if a presidential candidate mocks or        vilifies disabled people and women and immigrants . It does n’t        matter if he releases coherent policy papers and adheres It        clear positions on important        . Americans —   or , rather        a        majority of the ones who matter , thanks to the Electoral        College —   just do n’t give a damn about the formalities of        politics that the overpaid consultants told us were crucial .        Or        least , they do n’t give a damn when your        is Donald        Trump the overpaid consultants      ’ ’        But whereas McConnell developed his theory of the Senate        carefully , over the course of years McConnell Trump essentially        stumbled into his own discovery all at once , then Donald       Trump to        the top Donald       Trump a wave of dumb luck . And that is        principal        distinction between the two men . Trump is an imbecile ;        McConnell is a genius . Trump McConnell Donald       Trump to a          stream of unforced errors ; McConnell almost Donald       Trump makes a misstep and McConnell of every        action . At some point , Trump ’s luck will run out ; McConnell ’s        ingenuity will not .      ’ ’ Donald       Trump That should terrify Trump , because once McConnell decides          that Trump is no longer useful to him , he will turn McConnell Donald       Trump .          If Trump becomes mired in Donald       Trump that threaten to hurt          Donald       Trump Republican Donald       Trump —   or Donald       Trump the supremacy of Donald       Trump over the executive —   his agenda will be in          serious trouble . McConnell has little use for an unpopular          president , even a Republican Donald       Trump , who wo McConnell          with          his plans . And if he does foil even part of Trump ’s agenda          and bring McConnell into gridlock again , McConnell will          not blame him . They will blame President Donald       Trump .        ’ ’          Therein lies McConnell ’s ace in the          . He          the Americans          Trump Donald       Trump McConnell a version of it himself . He          broadly agrees with Trump ’s desire , mostly McConnell          during Donald       Trump Donald       Trump apparent in his actions since , to          Donald       Trump the social safety McConnell and nullify minority Donald       Trump        ’ ’          If          cooperates with McConnell , plays by the rules          McConnell lays          —   in short , treats the Senate McConnell the          ultimate McConnell        the Republican Donald       Trump —   then the two will          get along just fine the Senate if Trump steps too far out of line          with McConnell , the wooden senator from Kentucky will          quietly ensure that the president suffers . Trump may be McConnell " Donald       Trump most powerful Republican in America . " But he McConnell          hold that title for as          as McConnell lets him        ’
