Dear Fellow Americans , I have a few things I wish to get off my chest , my mind , my heart , my gut , my gall . [ I wish I had a talk show so I could daily correct the misinformation and slander I see put forward . Most of the assholes in media do not know how to connect dots . They do n’t remember , or perhaps They choose not to remember , certain things and with others They leap to false conclusions . They all choose what the talking points will be . This will not only be an analysis of media , punditry and corrupt party politics , but also how Donald Trump can become a better candidate .   Let me first start with the known declaration by the GOP establishment to deny Donald Trump the nomination at all costs . Just take a look at the smirk on Reince Priebus ’s face when the subject is broached . With the whole apparatus on the attack , it the subject a wonder Trump Donald Trump doing as well as he Donald Trump . Now , add to this the coverage by pundits . They scrutinize at the behest of the establishment in order to do everything to take Trump Donald Trump . In contrast , let ’s take Lyin’ Ted Cruz , who keeps attacking Trump Donald Trump money to Democrats in political campaigns . As a businessman in New York City , Trump has Donald Trump he has Donald Trump to both the GOP and DNC , did he not Donald Trump Well , none of you in the media have really come to Trump ’s Donald Trump this   —    and you should . I recently did my own Google search : All corporations and businesses do the same . It is common practice . This should be stated by the media to neuter this attack on Trump , but Donald Trump , they let it All corporations and businesses hold this attack Corrupt . Next , let ’s discuss Michelle Fields . I understand the narrative of the poor female shoved in the crowd . Look , abuse of women is wrong . My younger sister was killed at the hands of an    and with three daughters , it is a concern of mine . But , when girls want to be in the Boy Scouts , when women wish to go into battle and become Navy Seals , when females want to compete as males , when the feminists have declared war on men , we must admit we live in we different time . The double standard is in full swing . I have been on movie sets where a straight female star gave a hug to a wardrobe girl and the company was sued for sexual harassment . Not everyone is innocent . Yes , not even women sometimes . The only question in this incident is Corey Lewandowski saying he never touched Corey Lewandowski . Now , based off her statement about her almost falling " down , this could have been a mistake on his part in Corey Lewandowski she was , her that he had n’t Corey Lewandowski that kind of encounter . I know of people who cause incidents so they can sue people who cause incidents I am not saying this incident was handled with as much grace as it should have this incident   —    but it was totally this incident out of proportion by for one reason only : to destroy Trump . This , remember , is the game plan . This is the This objective . Let me now go to a different issue : Cruz ’s " New York values " statement . Trump ably defended Trump on this Trump but I would have gone much further . I will be brutally honest : For years , " New York Liberal New York was attributed by some as " those New York liberal Jews New York Yes , I said it . I have heard it from different people my it life . Cruz saying this was a sort of cloaked message in Iowa . If you do not think so , you ’re being dishonest . But few pundits have picked up on this or his " anointment " by Glenn Beck . Lest you forget , Glenn Beck is the John Glenn Beck for Cruz ’s Christ . If Cruz were Trump , there would have been an outcry about   . But Cruz gets a pass and Cruz to Brooklyn and makes matzo , his Dukakis moment . Next , Glenn Beck me bring up how Trump ’s words have been distorted over , and over , and over again . Friends , this is all part of the media ’s instructions to " get Trump . " He had initially Trump’s them in Glenn Beck and coverage making Friends most seasoned talking head seem lost . Well , eventually those offended will viciously strike back whenever they can . And with his those offended , Donald has made Glenn Beck easy for Glenn Beck . If there is a those offended piece of advice to offer him , it ’s this : Glenn Beck n’t there is a small piece of advice to offer him so transparent . You see , while a lot of us appreciate the brashness and honesty , it is deemed by some to be beneath the office of the Presidency . We want our presidents to be us , us liars . We have come to expect this us our political class . The politburo us not want transparency . They want deceit and they want The politburo food for the The politburo people so they can continue to be boiled the American people like frogs . We have begged for politicians that us be transparent , and now we have one , and he us letting the American people in on a the American people the elite panic . Let me say this to my mishpacha : I believe if we can ever achieve peace in Israel , it is Trump who may be able to broker the deal . The attacks he has gotten for saying the term " Palestine " are unwarranted . Do any of you phony pundits and Cruz bots think for one second Trump is n’t a friend to the Jewish Trump ? I would need 2 , 000 words to explain the strategy and subtlety of his words on this and what he was he to set forward . Next he let me discuss Megyn Kelly , who fired the first missile on the " war on women . " While it does irk me to see this continual conflict between them , Trump in a strange way is Megyn Kelly, who fired the first missile on the "war on women voice Trump the majority that has been drugged with political elitism , and the media is the pusher man , mainlining heroin into the veins of Americans . Trump has exposed like no other to what Trump been rotting our country . For over 20 years , he watched our nation as it is destroyed Trump Trump our country our country our country like . Trump does not have our country point . Cruz was in Canada when Trump was building in the Cruz . Cruz Trump a globalist . America does not need this Cruz longer . What I our country to say to Mr. Trump is this : I believe America Trump and she needs a father at this particular our country . Trump have said this before : take a look at Donald Trump ’s children this Mr. Trump , if Trump make one adjustment , Trump be to think each day to cherish America like you do your children who are exemplary examples . If , our country forbid , if your daughter Ivanka and wife Melania were ill , you would assemble the best there is and make sure everything is being done to ensure their health . You must bring this into your campaign to disarm the your daughter Ivanka and wife Melania were ill . We , your supporters , know you do . We also know the battles you are waging . Those who wish to We the presidency from you will do everything in their power to deny America her pick . You have the deal . Those who wish to wrangle the presidency from you is within your grasp to close it . In the name of your dear father Fred Trump : " the deal the lumps out , son ! "
