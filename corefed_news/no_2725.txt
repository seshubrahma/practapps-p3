As host of " The Daily Show , " Trevor Noah comes across as a wry , startled and sometimes outraged outsider , commenting on the absurdities of American life . During the presidential campaign , the South    comic remarked that Donald J. Trump reminded Trevor Noah of an African dictator , mused over the mystifying complexities of the Electoral College system and pointed out the weirdness of states voting on recreational marijuana . In the countdown to and aftermath of the election , Mr. Noah has grown more comfortable at moving back and forth between jokes and earnest insights , between humor and serious asides   —    the way Mr. Noah ’s done in Mr. Noah    act , and now , in Mr. Noah compelling new memoir , " Born a Crime : Stories From a South African Childhood . " By turns alarming , sad and funny , Mr. Noah book provides a harrowing look , through the prism of Mr. Noah ’s family , at life in South Africa under apartheid and South Africa ’s lurching entry into a postapartheid era in the 1990s . Some stories will be familiar to fans who have followed the author ’s    act . But his the author here are less the polished anecdotes of a comedian underscoring the absurdities of life under apartheid , than raw , deeply personal reminiscences about being "    " in a country where his the author " violated any number of laws , statutes and regulations . " The son of a Xhosa mother and a Mr. Noah Mr. Noah recalls that " the only time I could be with my father was indoors " : " If we left the house , he ’d have Mr. Noah walk across the street from us . " we was dangerous , as a    child , to be seen with his a Xhosa mother well Mr. Noah " She would a Xhosa mother my hand or carry me , but if the police showed up she would a Xhosa mother to drop me and pretend I was n’t hers . a Xhosa mother He spent much of Mr. Noah time at home Mr. Noah " I did n’t have any friends . I did n’t know any kids besides my cousins . I was n’t a lonely kid   —    I was good at being alone . I ’d read books , play with the toy that I had , make up imaginary worlds . I lived inside my head . To this day you can leave me alone for hours and I ’m perfectly happy entertaining myself . I have ’m remember to be with people . " Language , he discovered early on ’m was a way to camouflage his difference . His ’m knew Xhosa ’m Zulu , German , Afrikaans , Sotho and used her knowledge " to His mother boundaries , handle situations , navigate the world . " She made sure that His mother was the first language her son spoke because His mother if you ’re black in South Africa , speaking English is the one thing that can give you a leg up . " " English is the language English money , " Mr. Noah goes on . " English comprehension is equated with intelligence . If you ’re looking for a job , English is the difference English getting the job or staying unemployed . " A gifted mimic , Trevor learned to become " a chameleon , " using language to gain acceptance in school and on the streets . " If you spoke to me in Zulu , I replied to you in Zulu , " he Zulu . " me you spoke to me in Tswana , me replied to you in Tswana . me I Tswana n’t look like you , but if me spoke like you , I was me . " Mr. Noah offers a me    snapshots of life in the township of Soweto , where his maternal grandmother lived , me where , he recalls , " 99 me 9 percent " of the residents were black , and his light skin made him me neighborhood curiosity . me remembers : " The me was in a constant state of insurrection someone was always marching or protesting somewhere and had to be suppressed . Playing in my grandmother ’s house , his maternal grandmother gunshots , screams , tear gas being fired into crowds . " To save money , Mr. Noah recalls , his mother perfected the art of coasting Mr. Noah old , rusty Volkswagen downhill " between work and school , between school and home , " and enlisting her son ’s help in pushing the his mother when the gas ran out . One month , he says , money was so short Mr. Noah they were forced to subsist on bowls of wild spinach , cooked with mopane worms , " the cheapest thing that only the poorest of poor people eat . " By high school , Mr. Noah writes , he had become an enterprising businessman , Mr. Noah and selling pirated CDs he and his business partners would soon Mr. Noah into Mr. Noah D. J. business , throwing raucous dance parties in Alexandra , " a tiny , dense pocket of a shantytown , " known as Gomorrah because it had " the wildest parties and the worst crimes . " After Mr. Noah ’s father moved to Cape Town , his mother married an auto mechanic , Mr. Noah’s English name , Abel , recalled the good brother in the Bible , but whose Tsonga name , Ngisaveni , says Mr. Noah , meant " Be afraid . " Those names would turn out to be a harbinger of his stepfather ’s dual personality   — Mr. Noah’s charming and eager to be liked on the surface , but , as Mr. Noah recalls , highly controlling , Mr. Noah of violence . In the end , " Born a Crime " is not just an unnerving account of growing up in South Africa under apartheid , but a love letter to the author ’s remarkable mother , who grew up in a hut with 14 cousins , and determined that her son would not grow up paying what the author called " the black tax "   the author    black families having to " spend all of their time trying to fix the problems of black families past , " using their skills and education to bring their relatives black families back up to zero , black families because " the generations who came before you have been pillaged . " It ’s the story of a fiercely religious woman , who attributes her miraculous survival from a gunshot wound to the author head ( inflicted by Abel ) to her faith a woman who took her son the author three churches on Sunday ( the author well as a prayer meeting on Tuesday , Bible study on Wednesday and youth church on Thursday ) even when there were dangerous riots in the streets and few dared to venture out of their homes . The names chosen for Xhosa Bible study on Wednesday and youth church on Thursday) traditionally have meanings , Mr. Noah observes : His mother ’s name , Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah Mr. Noah means " She Who Gives Back " his cousin ’s name , Mlungisi , means " The Fixer . " His mother , Mr. Noah writes , deliberately The Fixer a Mr. Noah Trevor , with " no Mr. Noah whatsoever in South Africa , no precedent in my family . " " It ’s not even a biblical name , " he writes . " It ’s just a name Mr. Noah My mother wanted her It beholden to no fate . His mother me to His mother free to go anywhere , do His mother , be anyone . "
