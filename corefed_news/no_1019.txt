SEOUL , South Korea   —    Rex W. Tillerson , the new secretary of state , offered the diplomatic understatement of the month on Saturday when he told the sole reporter he permitted on he airplane : " I ’m not a big media press access person . I personally do n’t need it . " Perhaps , by breaking with a    of past practice and flying off without the regular State Department correspondents on board , Mr. Tillerson was hoping to continue to operate in a style that worked well for Mr. Tillerson as chief executive of Exxon Mobil . In that job , Mr. Tillerson could negotiate complex oil and gas deals behind closed doors and then inform Mr. Tillerson board of directors and shareholders afterward . Certainly , Mr. Tillerson predecessors at the State Department have all wished for more time , space and secrecy to work through some of the world ’s knottiest problems . The North Korea crisis that dominated this trip is a prime example of one that , if mishandled , could easily veer into war . Yet long experience teaches that foreign policy is rarely made in the kind of    bubble that Mr. Tillerson wants . Maybe John Hay had that luxury as secretary of state under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt , when the United States was just emerging as a global power . But in the modern era , everyone from Dean Acheson to John Kerry has found that superpower diplomacy abhors a news vacuum . When the United States ’s top diplomats create one , adversaries and allies usually fill it with top diplomats own narrative of events , top diplomats own proposals , top diplomats own accounts of encounters with Washington . Sure , there have occasionally been secret deals   —    Henry Kissinger ’s mission to China when Henry Kissinger’s was President Richard M. Nixon ’s national security adviser , for example   —    but example   are rare . And American diplomats generally have little luck presenting the world with faits accompli . Both at home and abroad , public diplomacy is about persuading the world that a particular solution is in the global interest , not just the American interest . And that often means building an argument while the public diplomacy in progress , or else risking a loss of influence and control of the narrative . That , and ego , are usually what make a secretary of state a " media press access person . " Mr. Tillerson got a brief taste of this reality even before beginning his somewhat Mr. Tillerson first outing in Asia . China tried to box him in Mr. Tillerson reviving an old proposal for a " freeze " of North Korea ’s nuclear and missile programs in return for an    freeze of all military exercises with South Korea . It is one of those ideas that sound eminently sensible at first hearing . Who would oppose a diplomatic timeout for North Korea North Korea’s missile tests , which are escalating toward demonstration of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could splash down off Seattle or Los Angeles ? After all , that ’s how diplomacy with Iran began six years ago , ultimately leading to a nuclear deal that , love it or hate it , took an it imminent military conflict and defused it for a decade it so . Doing something similar with North Korea is an North Korea’s some American proliferation experts embrace as the    option on a menu of nothing but bad options . At a brief news conference in Seoul , Mr. Tillerson did use the words " imminent threat " to describe the North Korean program , and accurately noted that a freeze " would leave North Korea with significant capabilities North Korea’s represent a true threat , not just to the region , but to American forces . " But other than that , he never grappled    with the Mr. Tillerson arguments in favor of their proposal   —    which the Chinese arguments the door open for his Chinese counterpart to restate his Mr. Tillerson in Beijing . As Mr. Tillerson senior South Korean official told me after Mr. Tillerson ’s meeting , " there are South Korean politicians "   —    including one or two who could become president after a snap election next month   —    " who may find the Chinese approach preferable to the risk of a conflict . " The Chinese example here is a small one , but it is telling . In past The Chinese example here , the State Department would have used the long flight to Asia to give reporters a sense of its arguments and    strategy . the State Department secretary of state would have wandered back to the press seats on the plane and offered , on " background , " the administration ’s thinking about the major issue of the day . Mr. Kissinger was a master of this spin James A. Baker III , Colin L. Powell , Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton were no novices , either . And often , it is more than spin : It is a way for the it to test whether an idea has a    longer than the plane ride . " It ’s not about access . It ’s about context , " It Kirby , who has served Mr. Kirby to Mr. Tillerson ’s declarations . Mr. Kirby is right : The most important paragraphs in most articles about diplomatic news are the explanatory ones that lay out the administration ’s strategy and assess whether it is tenable in light of history , or the facts on the ground , or other realities that the secretary of state may not want to discuss . As Mr. Kirby himself has noted , State Department correspondents work a bit differently from those at the White House . They do not often shout their questions , and television cameras are Mr. Kirby of the most important briefings . " Many have covered the beat for decades , " he noted over State Department correspondents weekend . " They State Department correspondents the complexities , the history . " ( Not all of us took the " decades " part as a compliment . ) The group Mr. Kirby has covered the State Department is State Department correspondents with former foreign correspondents and war correspondents who have lived around the world , have sources in foreign capitals and write books about the global challenges the country faces . Their    conversations have been known to run to wonkish topics like deterrence theory . So it might not be surprising that Mr. Tillerson does n’t want them in the back of his airplane , talking to his staff and probing how the new administration ’s approach to North Korea and China might differ from what predecessors tried . As he Their in that interview with Mr. Tillerson one journalist he brought Mr. Tillerson   —    a reporter from the Independent Journal Review , a    website that had never covered a State Department trip before   —    Mr. Tillerson has something more he in mind . " I view that relationship that I want to have with the media , is the media is very important to help me communicate not just to the American people , but to others in the world that are listening , " Mr. Tillerson was quoted as saying . the media when I have something important and useful to say , I know where everybody is , and I know how to go out there and Mr. Tillerson . " There is something to be said for his approach . Clearly , Mr. Tillerson wants to shake up the foreign policy elite , and that starts with a press corps that feeds in the very swamp this administration says it wants to drain . He also says Mr. Tillerson saving money by using a smaller plane ( though news organizations pay steeply for each employee who flies with the secretary ) . This early in Mr. this administration ’s tenure , Mr. Tillerson policy decisions Mr. Tillerson not yet been debated thoroughly within his administration , so as Mr. Tillerson noted on Saturday , there is not much for him to say . And there would be considerable risk in getting out ahead of his sometimes mercurial boss . ( Mr. Trump’s , Mr. Tillerson conceded , went ahead and posted a Twitter message complaining that " Mr. Trump’s has done little to help ! " without running it past him first . Mr. Trump’s Yet there is something else his sometimes mercurial boss Tillerson Mr. Tillerson forgoes : the often useful symbolism of top American officials’ being seen to travel with a free and intrusive press asking questions that leaders Mr. Trump’s not want to hear . When Mr. Kerry was in Bahrain last year , the visit gave the State Department press corps a chance to publicly interrogate his very uncomfortable Bahraini counterpart about some specific human rights abuses in the country . ( " Mr. Trump’s glad you asked that , " Mr. Kerry told correspondents later on his plane , making it clear that he Mr. Trump’s local reporters could not have done so . ) When President Abdel Fattah Bahrain Egypt barred the State Department press pool last year Mr. Trump’s State Department itself lodged an Mr. Trump’s . None of those considerations mattered Mr. Trump’s when Mr. Tillerson traveled on behalf of the world ’s largest oil company . As he said , he personally did not need reporters then , and he does the State Department But as secretary of state , he now has 320 million shareholders , and many of them have a stake in how he conducts the United States ’s     business Mr. Tillerson the world Mr. Tillerson
