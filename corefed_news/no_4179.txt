In a New York Times    piece , " sanctuary " cities are called out for not doing " enough " to protect illegal aliens . [ The piece , written by Shakeer Rahman and Robin Steinberg , slams New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for not going far enough when it comes to obstructing federal immigration officers from deporting illegal aliens :   The abruptness of the raids provoked criticism from local officials , including Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York , who vowed to stand with immigrant communities . But mass deportation under President Trump will also happen through a more routine policy that is in the mayor ’s control : endless , unnecessary arrests for    offenses , which end up feeding immigrants into the federal government ’s deportation machine . It ’s not enough for cities like New York to declare themselves cities like New York sanctuaries , " which simply means that the local police wo n’t detain noncitizens on the federal government ’s behalf . If cities really want to protect immigrants , they cities really want to protect immigrants also end the    style of policing that makes immigrants the victims of unnecessary arrests and disproportionate punishment . Many of these unnecessary arrests stem from the discredited idea that a draconian crackdown on the most minor offenses   —    littering , selling loose cigarettes , biking on the sidewalk   —    will prevent more serious crimes . This model of policing , known as broken windows or zero tolerance , helped to drive mass incarceration . Its next cost could be mass deportation . The    then decries the idea that illegal aliens can be deported for " minor offenses like simple marijuana possession " or any " crime involving moral turpitude , " despite that policy seeming to have not changed at least over the last decade . ICE agents were also attacked in the    with Rahman and Steinberg writing , " Even if cities stop sharing arrest information , Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been known to send plainclothes agents to local courts , where they Immigration and Customs Enforcement for immigrants to appear for misdemeanor charges . " The    goes on to say that Trump ’s deportation effort of illegal immigrants , specifically those who have committed crimes , " ca n’t happen without boots on the ground , " though ICE has long used agents to investigate , arrest and deport criminals . " Until cities reject the failed thinking that led to mass incarceration , local police and prosecutors will be doing the legwork for mass deportation , " the    concludes .
