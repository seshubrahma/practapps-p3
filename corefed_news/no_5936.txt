"   Chaffetz said , " [ W]e’re going to look hard at this . Devin Nunes ( ) and the House Intelligence Committee will take the lead on this . Devin Nunes ( ) and the House Intelligence Committee ’ll play a role [ as ] the Oversight Committee , but I ’m going to go into this eyes wide open . Devin Nunes ( ) and the House Intelligence Committee ’ve had experience . The Obama administration ’s been notorious on this type of stuff . And Devin Nunes ( ) and the House Intelligence Committee ’re going to look hard at this type of stuff . " He added , " [ L]et ’s remember what they did with James Rosen . Let Devin Nunes ( ) and the House Intelligence Committee remember that the IRS did target Americans based on Americans political beliefs . You know , my own personal case , I had more than 40 Secret Service agents illegally tap into my records and dive into my background , and that ’s according to the inspector general . So , this stuff does happen , and this stuff ’s not necessarily done the legal , lawful way . And so , yeah , we ’re going to take a look at it . " Chaffetz further stated that a paper trail of any wiretapping should be " fairly evident . " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
