" " This is the end for Twitter Twitter Anyone who cares about free speech has been sent a clear message : you ’re not welcome on Twitter Twitter " Twitter , a company in dire financial trouble , has developed a reputation for draconian , onesided and    suspensions of conservative users . Meanwhile , the platform has demonstrated an unashamed bias towards progressive causes like Black Lives Matter , ignoring open calls for violence against police officers that emerged following both the Dallas and Baton Rouge shootings . In further indication of its political biases , Twitter also let death threats against Republican Senators remain on the the platform months without taking action . Previous attempts to punish Milo have generated huge backlashes from conservative users , and this one   —    Twitter ’s Twitter severe clampdown on the Breitbart senior editor so far   —    may generate the biggest yet .
