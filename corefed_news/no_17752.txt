’   ’ ’    With control of the presidency , the House of Representatives , the    Senate , and at least one Supreme Court seat to fill , the GOP will    have the opportunity to make sweeping changes in the next four    years . ’ "    Since   is part of the Republican Party ’s platform ,    Americans can expect a    fight will be part of    the agenda . " ’    On his fourth day in office ,   reinstating    a gag order keeping nongovernmental organizations that receive    federal funding from discussing abortion abroad . ’ ’    While Trump once   Trump once   has since reversed Trump once   position , saying in Trump once      first interview after winning the election that Trump once   wants to    appoint " " judges , including a highly conservative    nominee to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat , with the goal of    overturning Roe v. Wade . ’ ’    The   decided in 1973 , gave women a    constitutional right to safe , legal abortions   —    and the justices    have upheld that precedent for over four decades . ’ ’    Roe would likely fall in one of two ways , according to   a constitutional scholar from Indiana    University and the legal director of   from 1988 to    1993 . ’ ’    The most drastic way the court could get rid of Roe would be to    overturn the case . The more likely scenario , however , would see    the court letting Roe stand but incrementally upholding laws that       access , making abortions impossible to get   —    rendering       procedure virtually illegal over time . ’ "    States have been trying to pass outright bans for years . They States       most successful at enacting . Some laws require women to have funerals for    aborted fetuses , or require waiting periods between appointments . " ’   ’ ’ a    expert and professor at Harvard Law    School , said two kinds of laws provide the most likely paths for    SCOTUS to overturn or undermine Roe . ’ ’    The first are known as . They aim to ban abortions when a fetus can    feel pain , which legislators typically claim is after 20 weeks ,       . ’ "    The Supreme Court has ruled that abortions are legal up to         —    when a fetus can survive on its a fetus outside the womb     —    but has neglected to define exactly when that is , and has n’t    taken on a    statute , Cohen said . " ’    The second kind of law is what reproductive rights activists call     or TRAP laws ,    that impose strict requirements on abortion clinics and       . ’ "    A TRAP law was at the heart of a major case taken up by the court    this past year , Whole Woman ’s Health v. Hellerstedt . The law in    question required abortion clinics in Texas to meet   from the exact size of the examination    rooms to admission privileges doctors had to secure for admitting       to local hospitals . " ’ the Supreme Court ruled in a   that the The law in   question provides few , if any , health benefits    for women , poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking    abortions , and constitutes an ’’ undue burden ’’ on their    women seeking   abortions right to do so . " ’ ’    Presumably , that means the high court has a    majority at the    moment that supports abortion , Cohen said . If it were to switch    course and uphold similar laws over time , the court the high court    away at    access in the US . ’ ’    The gradual erosion of Roe v. Wade is much more likely scenario    for a diminishing of abortion access , according to Cohen , because Cohen Chief Justice    Roberts often plays the " long game . " Roberts    hasn’’t Chief Justice John Roberts Roe or abortion ( as is    tradition with justices ) but he has said   yet   Chief Justice John Roberts Supreme Court cases while    on the bench . ’ ’    " Roberts , in particular , has Chief Justice John Roberts preferred the method of ’’ death    by 1 , 000 cuts ’’ to get rid of decisions he does not like   — Chief Justice John Roberts narrow    it , make small changes , et cetera . in a series of cases , " Cohen    told Business Insider . " He is very honorably committed to Cohen       idea of the integrity of the court , and my own sense is he would    not favor a Cohen    action that would cause half the country to    lose faith in the court    " ’ ’ the court short answer : Abortion rights would be up to the states . ’ ’    If Roe fell ,   have laws on the books banning abortion , so the    practice would be illegal there immediately . Other states would    likely act quickly to pass similar " trigger " laws . ’ ’    As Trump said in his first interview as president , that Trump    mean women in those states would " have to go to another state " to    get an abortion . ’ ’    ’    Restrictive abortion policies at the    tend to have a    " on poor women , immigrant women , women    of color , and women in rural areas , " said   the lead attorney on the Whole Woman’ ’s Health case and    a senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights . ’ ’    That would likely become even more apparent if Roe fell . ’ ’    " What we would end up with is a country where there is a    patchwork of rights depending on where you live , " Toti told    Business Insider . " Your ZIP code will start to determine whether    you have access to safe abortion , and other reproductive health    services , or not . ’       " As we learned from our recent experience in Texas , while we    very restrictive clinic shut down law was in effect in that    state , not every woman can afford to travel out of state to    access abortion care , " she added . ’ ’   ’ every woman coordinated by the University of Texas supports    Toti ’s assertion . Texas Texas’ law went into effect in 2013 , the    number of clinics providing abortions in the state dropped in    half , Texas as of November 2015   —    increasing the number of    women who lived over 50 miles from a clinic in Texas from 1 . 2    million to 4 . 2 million . " ’    Toti said she doesn’’t think Roe is in " any Toti jeopardy , "    largely because both the Supreme Court and a majority of    Americans support abortion . ’ ’    Pew Research Center polls have found that 59 % of US adults today    support the legality of abortion in general and 69 % want the    Supreme Court to uphold Roe   the Supreme Court that have risen over    time . ’ ’   ’ ’    Trump has said he’’ll announce his Supreme Court justice    nomination   and reports indicate he’ Trump the Supreme Court down    to   one of whom has called Roe an    " . " ’ "    Even once Trump fills the late Justice Antonin Scalia ’s seat ,    Toti Trump , the court will likely still have a    majority that    would uphold Roe . " ’    " Less than four months ago , a majority of Supreme Court justices    reaffirmed more than four decades of precedent holding that every    woman has a fundamental , constitutional right to access abortion .    We are confident that the court will not back away from    , "    Toti the court " Regardless of how the current vacancy is filled , that    majority decision stands as controlling precedent . " ’ "    It will likely be some time before Trump ’s nomination can    actively participate in cases . Toti estimated Trump lengthy    Senate approval Toti will sideline the new justice until at    least October 2017 . And even if his Supreme Court justice    aggressively      Trump would still need another justice to retire or die his Supreme Court justice    Trump Trump , an unlikely scenario in the next four    years . " ’    Not everyone is as optimistic as Toti . If Trump is elected for a Toti second term , the chances of him choosing Trump justice go up   —      as do the chances of Trump falling . ’ ’    Johnsen , Roe constitutional law expert , pointed to   who has enacted some of the    strictest antiabortion laws in the country as governor of    Indiana , as evidence of which way the political winds are    blowing . ’ ’    " I am very pessimistic about it , and that’ ’s because I’’m thinking    about the range of ways Roe can fall that would not require the Roe Supreme Court to    say , ’’ We are overruling the Supreme Court ’’ "    Johnsen said . " We’’ve seen the kinds of laws that would shut    clinics , and ban abortions for reasons , and force women to be    interrogated by their doctors   —    and that all could be upheld    without the Supreme Court actually saying , ’’ We’’re women Roe    v. Wade . ’’ the Supreme Court   ’ ’    Advocacy groups are   and they received an   to help them wage    costly court battles across the country . ’ ’    " We will continue Advocacy groups fight for a country in Advocacy groups all women have    access to the country , contraception , and safe pregnancy care , "    Toti said . " We haven’’t met that Toti yet . We don’’t have that    situation now . There are women   Toti parts of the country who We face lots of challenges , but We are going to keep pushing to move    forward and to make things better the country we won’’t allow    backsliding . " ’ ’ We Erica Sackin , director of political communications for Planned    Parenthood , told Business Insider that We healthcare provider       " absolutely gearing up for a huge fight , " and that the wave of    donations they received underline how many people support    upholding Roe   —    including those who voted for Trump . ’ ’    "    seen " ’ ’   Erica Sackin, director of political communications for Planned   Parenthood number of laws across the country that try to take Trump away women’ ’s access to safe , legal abortions .
