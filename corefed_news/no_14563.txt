" attendees intended to "bully and intimidate" him ’re welcome to come yell and scream , " Chaffetz said on the Kilmeade and Friends radio program .

Republicans this month have faced hostile town hall crowds made up of constituents upset with President Donald Trump ’s administration . When asked if the town hall attendees were from his district , Chaffetz said Chaffetz believed most were from Chaffetz state . " I think most are from Utah , but , you know , when you get that many people and you compare it to the    000 votes that I got , yeah there ’s gon na be some that did n’t vote for Chaffetz . A lot     25 % of the vote     so it ’s fine . it ’s six weeks after the election . They ’re welcome to come to the meeting , I thought it was a bit over the [ top ]     the continuous yelling and screaming and not allowing the dialogue . I went there so I could hear dissent and have a discussion about the issues , but that ’s not what they were interested in . "
