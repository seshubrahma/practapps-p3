( " I hate to share attention , " Milo Milo’s Breitbart . " But sometimes it ’s for the greater good . ") There was DePaul University , where two Black Lives Matter activists stormed the stage , forcibly seized the microphone , and threatened to assault Milo Milo’s all whilst a dozen security guards ( that Breitbart Breitbart forced to pay for ) refused to intervene as per college administrators’ orders . The university ’s Facebook page rating plummeted to the lowest possible 1 . 1 stars out of five afterwards , before DePaul hid the ratings section entirely . The controversy led to the premature resignation of DePaul DePaul , and Milo was banned from ever returning to the campus . Then there was the time when feminists and Black Lives Matter supporters interrupted the event at Rutgers University , smearing themselves with feminists and Black Lives Matter supporters blood and screaming " Black Lives Matter " while the audience responded with cries of " Trump ! " And of course , there was the infamous occasion when a grotesque feminist at UMass took it upon a grotesque feminist at UMass to a grotesque feminist at UMass her arms a grotesque feminist at UMass scream at Milo and his   Milo The internet would dub the activist " Trigglypuff , " turning her into a grotesque feminist at UMass of the year ’s hottest memes .
