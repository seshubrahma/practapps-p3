On Saturday , MSNBC interviewed Dane Waters of Delegates Unbound , a group trying to get the Republican National Convention to adopt rules that allow delegates to " unbind " delegates from the GOP ’s Donald Trump .   Waters said that not unbinding the delegates is " an assault to democracy . " " the delegates are angry . They the delegates angry , outraged at what happened . What we ’re there to do is help them the delegates it clear to the rest of the world that they the delegates outraged , they the delegates unhappy and they the delegates angry , unhappy . What happened is an assault to democracy , in my opinion . It flies in the face of everything the Republican party stands for and ca n’t be allowed to stand , " Waters told MSNBC ’s Jacob Soboroff .
