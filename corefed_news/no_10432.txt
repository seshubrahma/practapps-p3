During CNN ’s coverage of the Democratic National Convention on Thursday , CNN Senior Political Commentator and former Senior Adviser to President Obama David Axelrod said that Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s speech was " effective " but that " Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s did n’t give a great speech tonight . "   President Obama David Axelrod stated , " This is not Hillary Clinton ’s event . This is   —    if presidential races were decathlons , giving a speech like this is not Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s strength , and Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s did n’t give a great speech tonight . Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s did not give a great speech tonight , but Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s hit some ground that is very , very valuable to Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s . I think the arguments against Trump , particularly the one I mentioned on     the other one is going after on the I alone can can fix the other one , which I think we heard the president work that last night . I think that ’s a very damaging argument against the president , and not just with Democrats or Independents , but with conservatives and Republicans . I think on the economics , she probably scored very , very well , because people were looking for real proposals that people think might help people , not just trust me , I can do it . I suspect she scored well with that . Was it a great speech ? No . Was it an effective speech in moving the ball forward ? I think yes . " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
