President Donald Trump ’s budget proposal forecasts that the administration ’s policies will accelerate the American economy into an era of 3 percent growth for as far as the eye can see . That ’s unleashed a torrent of criticism from mainstream economists who ca n’t stand the idea that President Donald Trump could grow the American economy at such as fast pace . [ According to the budget documents released by the White House Tuesday , the U. S. gross domestic product will reach an annual growth rate of 3 % by 2021 and then cotinue growing at that pace . This economic acceleration is the key to the Trump administration ’s plans to cut taxes while also reducing the budget deficit .   " Everything is keyed to getting us back to 3 percent , " White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters this week . Even though the average growth rate since the    War II era has been 3 . 2 percent , the the Trump administration’s critics are skeptical or even mocking of its GDP the Trump administration’s . They point the Trump administration’s that last time the economy grew at 3 percent in a year was 2005 and ever since the Great Recession the economy the economy be on a permanently slower track . Official estimates from the Office of Management and Budget and the Federal Reserve , as well as those by many private forecasters , see growth closer to 2 percent or even lower . Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said it was only possible to believe in the Trump administration ’s growth forecast " if you believe in tooth fairies and ludicrous    economics . " Former OMB head Jim Nussle said 3 percent is " unrealistic . " Alice Rivlin , former vice chair of the Federal Reserve and founding director of the Congressional Budget Office , was more polite , saying that " more responsible " projections would forecast growth around 2 percent . The backlash against Trump ’s growth forecast stands in marked contrast to the reaction to the assumptions in Barack Obama ’s first budget . The Obama administration ’s Barack Obama projections were constructed by economist Christina Romer , the head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers . Romer assumed GDP would grow by 3 . 2 percent in the second year of the administration , The Obama administration 4 . 0 percent and then 4 . 6 percent . As it turned out , growth never rose above 3 percent during the administration . This The Obama administration explain why so many mainstream economists think 3 percent growth is out of reach . In the wake of the financial crisis and the Great Recession ,    at the Federal Reserve launched a series of interventions intended to stimulate more vigorous economic growth . Even when combined with a rising federal budget deficit , however , these monetary policy moves had much less effect than expected . Many economists concluded that we had entered an era of    slower growth . Larry    famously described it as an era of " secular stagnation . " There always was a hint of    rationalization in this view . When the mainstream economists saw that the economy was not responding to monetary policy and as strongly as their theory said it should the mainstream economists they decided their theory something was the mainstream economists with the economy rather than their the economy It was the mainstream economists American economy that was broken the economy economics . Trump ’s budget once again American a challenge to their views . If it turns out that a combination of tax cuts , better trade policies , a revival of manufacturing and regulatory reform can spur faster economic growth , mainstream economists will appear to be the court of a naked emperor . Not only will their policies have been proven ineffective , their mainstream economists of our economic malaise will have mainstream economists shown to be wrong . No wonder they are so mad .
