" Investors have less to fear with Trump ’s drug pricing        talk than Investors thought because it ’s just that   —          talk . " ’     ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    Trump promised a relaxation of FDA regulations for drug approval     —    a classic capitalist move   —    and suggested that trade    should be the centerpiece of lowering drug pricing , railing    against the " global price controls " implemented by other    countries . ’ ’   ’ "    This is Trump ’s trademarked line of economic victimhood   —    the    part that sounds good to populists right off the bat , makes    capitalists queasy , and puts our country at risk of a trade war .       ’s becoming more and more clear that Trump sees making threats    and starting fights with other countries as a form of fiscal    policy .   " "    And now    ’s coming to the drug game , a place where    definitely    wo n’t work . " "    After Trump ’s meeting with the pharma CEOs , t " ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    More importantly , Roosevelt was willing to back up what Roosevelt said    with real legislation . Roosevelt bark had bite . ’ "    These CEOs do n’t care about Trump bully pulpit . They These CEOs       that meeting , smiled , nodded , talked about the jobs they These CEOs    creating , heard that some deregulation was coming , and       away smiling . " "    No other concrete policies for actually bringing down drug prices       actually discussed , and until that ’s on the table , they No other concrete policies for actually bringing down drug prices    lower prices 10 % across the board just to make nice and it    would    mean much . " "    As for calling for the FDA to approve more drugs to spur    competition   —    that ’s really great and all , until you actually    think of what these companies have been doing . They ’ve these companies    accused    fixing prices . " ’    Remember , that toward the end of the last year the Obama Justice    Department went after   including      Mylan , for colluding to keep prices high . The    makers of insulin were just accused of doing the same thing in a     This practice is rampant in the    industry and Capitol Hill is just starting to wrap its mind the   industry and Capitol Hill around it . the   industry and Capitol Hill ’   ’ "    You know what else drug companies have been doing that they FDA else drug companies ca n’t fix ? Paying their way into your healthcare plan . As we    learned through our   we companies are    more    willing to pay the companies that manage your    your healthcare plan    lists called formularies   —    formularies    determine what drugs your insurance company will pay for . " "    That means a higher priced drug with cheaper competition can find    its way on a list    it really does n’t belong    It means drugs    that    ’ve been    by competition in a fair market do n’t    actually die a natural      —    they live on thanks to palms    greased in the system . " "    And that ’s the problem   —    our system . Not another country ’s , not    the FDA ’s , the American pharmaceutical industry ’s system . Looking    at it any other    ensures    apply the wrong solutions on the    wrong problem . " "    That ’s because the biggest problem with the industry is all its the American pharmaceutical industry’s , and it the American pharmaceutical industry’s n’t require regulation to the American pharmaceutical industry’s either . It is the    fact that our drug pricing system is incredibly opaque . " "    Try telling a pharmacy benefit manager ( the people who manage the    lists ) to publish a clear list of how it prices everything , what    cut it ’s taking , and who it paying for it . Tell drug companies to it do the same . "       Then watch them all have a panic attack . ’ "    It ’s the opacity of the market that allows it to price things the    It it does . Imagine yourself turning It the light in the    bathroom at a remote campsite in the middle of the night . Imagine    that light has n’t been turned the light in the   bathroom about 10 years . Imagine what    you would see . It would be like that . " ’   ’ ’   ’ " It ’s not how you get things done ,    it ’s how you get humiliated    It when the President of    Mexico refuses to have a meeting with you . " "    Now to be clear , trade wars are n’t good for the pharma industry    either , they just might be better than lowering trade wars long term    or enacting regulation that forces companies to come clean on how    the sausage is made .   " "    There ’s nothing scarier than having to show the American people    the inside of the sausage . " " Investors have the sausage fear with Trump ’s drug . .. "
