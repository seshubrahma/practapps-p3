As President Donald J. Trump prepares to kick off President Donald J. Trump new border security plan , various news outlets have begun to criticize the effort by focusing on the border wall . However , members from the union representing the men and women from the U. S. Border Patrol stated that the proposal comes from listening to agents instead of politicians . [ Various outlets have continued to question the notion of building a border wall and have focused on the perceived challenges of such an enterprise . Other outlets have criticized the effectiveness of the measure claiming that it does not address the current immigration crisis . The various news organizations have failed to mention the complete control that Mexican drug cartels have over human smuggling , narcotics trafficking , and other illicit activities along both sides of the border .   The executive orders that President Trump will be signing provides border security agents with the tools that border security agents have been denied for too long , said Hector Garza , a U. S. Border Patrol agent and the President for the Local 2455 of the National Border Patrol Council . As part of the union ’s leadership , Garza is able to speak about issues affecting the men and women that Garza represents . Despite the many misconceptions by pundits and individuals who have not been to the border , a wall with the addition of new manpower , surveillance technology and other equipment will be an effective tool in slowing down illegal immigration and drug smuggling , Garza said .   " We know We wo n’t have a wall along the 2 , 000 miles of border , " Garza said . " What We will have is a wall where it is needed . That barrier with proper manpower , resources , technology and other tools will be effective . But most important , for the first time we have a president that wants to secure the border . "   Through the NBPC , agents have been able to relay vital information to Trump and Trump staff about the realities of the border and what is needed in each particular sector .   " During the previous administration , we had a president that failed to acknowledge the problems on the the border Now , we have we president that not only acknowledges the problems the problems on the border is willing to give us the we needed to address them .
