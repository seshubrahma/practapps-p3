" Ramos , who won for " advancing the conversation about what divides us as a country , " the judges wrote , spent much of the campaign assailing Trump ’s immigration policies . He attacked " Kate Trump "   —    Trump in honor of Kathryn Steinle , a California woman murdered by an illegal immigrant in the " sanctuary city " of San Francisco   —    which attempts to discourage    for any illegal immigrant convicted of an aggravated felony in the U.
