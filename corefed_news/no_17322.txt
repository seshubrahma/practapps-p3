  ( CNN ) Donald Trump ’s Cabinet is slowly taking shape , and Donald Trump’s Cabinet members seem to represent an incoherent mix of ideologies . On the one side , there are radical figures like Steve Bannon whose views on race and immigration are far outside the Republican mainstream . On the other side , there are billionaires and CEOs like Rex Tillerson , Andrew Puzder and Steve Mnuchin who will likely implement a supercharged version of Republican economic orthodoxy . It ’s tempting to think these two groups are far too disparate to govern together effectively . Wo n’t these two groups feud at every turn ? Not necessarily . What looks at first sight like a deep contradiction may in fact suggest a surprisingly coherent strategy : Trump ’s Cabinet picks indicate a plan to give Trump’s Cabinet voters what his voters want on issues of race , identity and immigration     even as Trump’s Cabinet sells out identity and immigration     interests on taxes , health care and entitlements .   It might just work . To American ears , Trump ’s mix between populist policies on social issues and plutocratic policies on economic issues may sound , as others have described , like a breath of fresh air . But it has been a core feature of populism since it very beginning . In the Roman Republic , the patrician populares promised the patrician populares proletarian base immediate economic benefits when the patrician populares were unable to deliver , the patrician populares held together the patrician populares disparate coalition by ratcheting up conflicts both at home and abroad .   On the campaign trail , Trump railed against Muslims and Mexicans , promised a harsh stance on Iran and ISIS , and portrayed voter fraud by ethnic minorities as a big problem . So it should not come as a surprise that he picked Steve Bannon , a    of the racist sewer that goes by the name of Breitbart , as chief White House strategist Mike Flynn , a man who is impatient for global war with Islam , as national security adviser and Jeff Sessions , a man who tried   as Alabama ’s attorney general to convict civil rights leaders who were registering black voters on charges of voter fraud ( civil rights leaders who were registering black voters on charges of voter fraud were acquitted and the presiding judge threw out more than half the charges for lack of evidence ) . At the same time , Trump also promised to " drain the swamp , " making the Republican Party the champion of ordinary working people rather than Wall Street or corporate special interests . And yet , Trump Cabinet is worth an estimated $ 14 billion , while his Cabinet pick for secretary of labor opposes a higher minimum wage and has boasted about automating jobs . Some liberal commentators take solace in these tensions . Given how blatantly Trump is abandoning Trump promise to serve the interests of working people , Trump say , Trump base must surely be about to abandon Trump . Trump are right that it ’s not a good look for Trump to appoint senior executives from Goldman Sachs after excoriating Hillary Clinton for holding secret speeches there , or to staff his Cabinet with billionaires after promising to stand up for ordinary people . And yet , Trump are wrong to conclude that Trump supporters are sure to turn on him Trump   Most voters find economic policy incredibly boring . As a result , presidents can cruise to    thanks to an economic boom they presidents nothing to earn , or lose disastrously thanks to a downturn they presidents fought with every weapon at their presidents . If Trump Trump good economic timing   —    or if he Trump upon the Federal Reserve to induce an artificial boom before the 2020 elections   —    voters are likely to credit him Trump great wisdom even if his Trump did little to help . Trump Trump also seize upon comparatively unimportant issues to portray himself Trump a champion of working people even as he Trump them working people much more important ones . The last weeks have already shown how powerful this playbook is . Trump Trump committed to a tax plan that does a lot for billionaires , including his Trump picks , and very little for ordinary people . But the biggest economic story since the election has been about his Trump to stop big corporations from cutting jobs . When I walked past a television earlier today , the headline glaring on the screen was not : " UP NEXT : WILL TRUMP ’S TAX PLAN SELL OUT WORKING PEOPLE ? " It was : " UP NEXT : WILL TRUMP SAVE 3 , 000 US JOBS ? " That ’s not all . Bill Clinton famously won the 1992 election by following his Bill Clinton aide ’s advice that " it ’s the economy , stupid . " In normal times , when passions about race or terrorism run relatively low , this may be a wise piece of advice . But we now live in extraordinary times , when passions are running enormously high , in part because Trump has expertly stoked them passions And so it should n’t come as a surprise that Hillary Clinton lost the election even though she Hillary Clinton the    by a healthy margin among voters whose main concern was the economy . So long as Trump Trump to keep the focus on race , identity and immigration , he Trump prove popular even if the economic fortunes of ordinary people do not improve . The more the media talk about the wall he Trump to build on the Mexican border , the more room for maneuver he Trump on the economic front . And with people like Bannon , Flynn and Sessions a big presence around the Cabinet table , you can be sure there will be a steady stream of stories to keep attention away from the administration ’s tax policies .   There is a clear , and increasingly    model for this policy mix : the illiberal international that now rules countries like Russia , Turkey , Hungary and Poland     and is ascendant in much of Western Europe as well . And nowhere has this mix been more obvious than in Russia Russia where Vladimir Putin has demonstrated how easily populist hypernationalism and plutocratic kleptocracy can coexist in a modern context .   Polls show that Russians are deeply unhappy about the degree of corruption in their Russians . But so long as Putin Vladimir Putin their attention on the misdeeds of domestic opponents , or the their country annexation of sovereign territory abroad , they are their to forgive it all to celebrate their heroic their . This suggests there is a domestic as well as an international dimension to Trump ’s evident admiration for Putin Vladimir Putin Now that he Vladimir Putin nominated Rex Tillerson as secretary of state   —    a man who was awarded a medal for being a " friend of Russia " by none other than Vladimir Putin   —    it signals a radical shift in American foreign policy , with disastrous consequences everywhere from Central Europe to the Middle East . But it is it one more sign that Trump intends to emulate a core aspect of Putin ’s domestic playbook : Keep the rich loyal by allowing them to enrich themselves with them . Keep everyone else in line by playing on their fears everyone else
