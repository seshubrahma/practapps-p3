Tuesday on MSNBC ’s " Morning Joe , "    Mika Brzezinski decried Sen. Elizabeth Warren ’s ( ) doubling down on Sen. Elizabeth Warren opposition of    Donald Trump from the U. S. Senate floor , which according to   Mika Brzezinski was n’t " very constructive " in Sen. Elizabeth Warren mind .   " Do you lead on anger , though ? "   Mika Brzezinski said . " Because that does n’t seem very constructive to   Mika Brzezinski . I got to tell you , I love Sen. Elizabeth Warren . I ’m getting tired of this act . " Later in the segment ,    Willie Geist suggested Warren speaking for those that thought " Trump is a disaster , " to which   Mika Brzezinski pointed out there were many who did n’t feel that way and that Warren needed to reconsider Warren message to be more " inclusive . " " There ’s a huge part of the country that does n’t think so , " Warren said " And Warren might want to be a little bit inclusive , instead of sounding like the people Warren is accusing of being exclusive . Warren ’s just got to stop , I ’m sorry . It is getting exhausting . And this was not helpful during the campaign , this just was n’t . There ’s an anger there that was shrill , and a step above what it needed to be   —    unmeasured and almost unhinged . " It is not going to work , at some point we have to look at what happened , and look at the people who we lost along the way , " Brzezinski continued . " Those are the people who Elizabeth Warren has been fighting for for decades . Those are the people who have been left out because of a rigged system . Those were Elizabeth Warren people , and now Elizabeth Warren ’s leaving her people out of the conversation . It does n’t make sense to me . Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
