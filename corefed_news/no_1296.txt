Until Nov. 8 , 2016 , historians of American politics shared a rough consensus about the rise of modern American conservatism . It told a respectable tale . By the end of World War II , the story goes , conservatives had become a scattered and obscure remnant , vanquished by the New Deal and the apparent reality that , as the critic Lionel Trilling wrote in 1950 , liberalism was " not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition . " Year Zero was 1955 , when William F. Buckley Jr. started National Review , the    magazine whose aim , William F. Buckley Jr. explained , was to " articulate a position on world affairs which a conservative candidate can adhere to without fear of intellectual embarrassment or political surrealism . " William F. Buckley Jr. excommunicated the John Birch Society ,    and supporters of the hyperindividualist Ayn Rand , and William F. Buckley Jr. cohort fused the diverse schools of conservative thinking   —    traditionalist philosophers , militant    libertarian economists   —    into a coherent ideology , one that eventually came to dominate American politics . I was one of the historians who helped forge this narrative . My first book , " Before the Storm , " was about the rise of Senator Barry Goldwater , the uncompromising National Review favorite whose refusal to exploit the violent backlash against civil rights , and whose bracingly idealistic devotion to the Constitution as he understood it   —    he called for Social Security to be made " voluntary "   —    led to he crushing defeat in the 1964 presidential election . Goldwater ’s loss , far from dooming the American right , inspired a new generation of conservative activists to redouble conservative activists efforts , paving the way for the Reagan revolution . Educated whites in the prosperous metropolises of the New South sublimated the frenetic , violent anxieties that once marked race relations in Educated whites in the prosperous metropolises of the New South region into more palatable policy concerns about " stable housing values " and " quality local education , " backfooting liberals and transforming conservatives into mainstream champions of a set of positions with enormous appeal to the white American middle class . These were the factors , many historians concluded , that made America a " center right " nation . For better or for worse , politicians seeking to lead either party faced a new reality . Democrats had to honor the public ’s distrust of activist government ( as Bill Clinton did with Bill Clinton call for the " end of welfare as we know it " ) . Republicans , for Republicans part , had to play the Buckley role of denouncing the political surrealism of the paranoid fringe ( Bill Clinton ’s furious backpedaling after joking , " No one ’s ever asked to see my birth certificate " ) . Then the nation ’s    birther ran for president . Trump ’s campaign was surreal and an intellectual embarrassment , and political experts of all stripes told us he Bill Clinton never become president . That was n’t how the story was supposed to end . National Review devoted an issue to writing Trump Trump’s of the conservative movement an editor there , Jonah Goldberg , even became a leader of the " Never Trump " crusade . But Trump Trump’s   —    and some conservative intellectuals embraced a man who exploited the same brutish energies that Buckley had supposedly banished . The professional guardians of America ’s past , in short , had made a mistake . We advanced a narrative of the American right that was far too constricted to anticipate the rise of a man like Trump Trump’s Historians , of course , are not called upon to be seers . Our professional canons warn us Our presentism   —    we Our supposed to weigh the evidence of the past on its presentism   terms   —    but at the same time , the questions we Our are conditioned by the present . That is , ultimately , what we Our called upon to explain . Which poses a question : If Donald Trump is the latest chapter of conservatism ’s story , might historians have been telling that story ? American historians’ relationship to conservatism itself has a troubled history . Even after Ronald Reagan ’s    landslide in 1980 , we paid little attention to the right : The central narrative of America ’s political development was still believed to be the rise of the liberal state . But as Newt Gingrich ’s    revolutionaries prepared to take over the House of Representatives in 1994 , the scholar Alan Brinkley published an essay called " The Problem of American Conservatism " in The American Historical Review . American conservatism American Conservatism argued the scholar Alan Brinkley " had been something of an orphan in historical scholarship , " and that was " coming to seem an     omission . " The article inaugurated the boom in scholarship that brought us the story , now widely accepted , of conservatism ’s triumphant rise . That story was the story a rejection of an older story . Until the 1990s , the most influential writer on the subject of the American right was Richard Hofstadter , a colleague of Trilling ’s at Columbia University in the postwar years . Hofstadter was the leader of the " consensus " school of historians the " consensus " being Americans’ supposed agreement upon moderate liberalism as the nation ’s natural governing philosophy . He did n’t take Americans’    conservatives of his own time at Americans’ seriously . He called them " Americans’ " and described , for instance , followers of the    Republican senator Joseph McCarthy as cranks who salved their " status anxiety followers of the   Republican senator Joseph McCarthy with conspiracy theories and bizarre panaceas . He named this attitude Americans’ the paranoid style in American politics " and , in an article published a month before Barry Goldwater ’s presidential defeat , asked , " When , in all our history , has anyone with ideas so bizarre , so archaic , so    so remote from the basic American consensus , ever gone so far ? " It was a strangely ahistoric question many of Goldwater ’s ideas hewed Barry Goldwater’s to a    American distrust of statism that goes back all the way to the nation ’s founding . It betokened too a certain willful blindness toward the evidence that was already emerging of a popular backlash against liberalism . Reagan ’s gubernatorial victory in California two years later , followed by his two landslide presidential Reagan , made a mockery of Hofstadter . Historians seeking to grasp conservatism ’s newly revealed mass appeal would have to take the movement on its own terms . newly revealed mass appeal was my aim when I took up the subject in the late 1990s   —    and , even more explicitly , the aim of Lisa McGirr , now of Harvard University , whose 2001 book , " Suburban Warriors : The Origins of the New American Right , " became a cornerstone of the new literature . Instead of pronouncing upon conservatism from on high , as Hofstadter had , McGirr , a social historian , studied it from the ground up , attending respectfully to what activists understood themselves to be doing activists What she found was " a highly educated and thoroughly modern group of men and women , " normal participants in the " bureaucratized world of    War II America . " They built a " " normal participants in the "bureaucratized world of   War II America and remarkable political mobilization , " she wrote , in she effort to address political concerns that would soon be resonating nationwide   —    for instance , their anguish at " " normal participants in the "bureaucratized world of   War II America permissiveness " about matters like rising crime rates and the teaching of sex education in public schools . But if Hofstadter was overly dismissive of how conservatives understood themselves , the new conservatives of historians at times proved too credulous . McGirr diligently played down the sheer bloodcurdling hysteria of conservatives during the period she was studying   McGirr    for example , one California senator ’s report in 1962 that he had received thousands one California senator’s letters from constituents concerned about a rumor that Communist Chinese commandos were training in Mexico for an imminent invasion of San Diego . I sometimes made the same mistake . Writing about the movement that led to Goldwater ’s 1964 Republican nomination , for instance , it never occurred to me to pay much attention to McCarthyism , even though McCarthy helped Goldwater win his Senate Goldwater in McCarthy , and Goldwater supported McCarthy to Goldwater end McCarthy ( As did William F. Buckley . ) I was writing about the modern conservative movement , the one that led to Reagan , not about the brutish relics of a more gothic ,    and supposedly incoherent reactionary era that preceded it . A few historians have provocatively followed a different intellectual path , avoiding both the bloodlessness of the new social historians and the psychologizing condescension of the old Hofstadter school . Foremost among them is Leo Ribuffo both the bloodlessness of the new social historians and the psychologizing condescension of the old Hofstadter school a professor at George Washington University . Ribuffo ’s surname announces his identity in the Ribuffo’s surname style : Irascible , brilliant and deeply learned , he is one of Ribuffo’s surname profession ’s great rebuffers . He made his reputation Ribuffo’s surname an Ribuffo’s surname 1983 study , " The Old Christian Right : The Protestant Far Right From the Great Depression to the Cold War , " and has n’t published a proper book since   —    just a series of coruscating essays that frequently focus on what everyone else is getting wrong . In the 1994 issue of The American Historical The American Historical Review Brinkley the scholar Alan Brinkley The Problem of American Conservatism , " American Conservatism a response contesting Brinkley ’s contention the scholar Alan Brinkley Ribuffo , that Trilling was right about American conservatism ’s shallow roots . Ribuffo argued that America ’s America traditions were far more Ribuffo rooted in the past , and far angrier , than most historians would acknowledge , citing a long list of examples from " regional suspicions of various metropolitan centers and the snobs who lived there " to " white racism institutionalized in slavery and segregation . " After the 1964 presidential election , Ribuffo told me that if he were to write a similar Ribuffo today , he would Ribuffo it , " Why Is There So Much Ribuffo on ‘ Conservatism,’ and Why Has It Left the Historical Profession So Obtuse About Trumpism ? " it reason , as Ribuffo argues , is the conceptual error of identifying a discrete Ribuffo modern conservative movement " in the first place . Another reason , though , is that historians of conservatism , like historians in general , tend to be liberal , and are prone to liberalism ’s traditions of politesse . It ’s no surprise that we are attracted to polite subjects like " colorblind conservatism " or William F. Buckley . Our work might have been less obtuse had we shared the we of a New York University professor named we   . " Historians who write about the right should find ways to do so with a sense of the dignity of their subjects , " she observed in a 2011 review , Historians who write about the right but they should not hesitate to keep an eye out for the Historians who write about the right , the unusual , or the unsettling . " Looking back from that perspective , we can now see a history that is indeed unsettling   —    but also unsettlingly familiar . Consider , for example , an essay published in 1926 by Hiram Evans , the imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan , in the exceedingly mainstream North American Review . His subject was the decline of " Americanism . " Evans an essay published in 1926 by Hiram Evans, the imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, in the exceedingly mainstream North American Review to speak for an abused white majority , " an essay published in 1926 by Hiram Evans, the imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, in the exceedingly mainstream North American Review    Nordic race , " which , " with all its faults , has given the world almost the whole of modern civilization . " Evans , a former dentist , proposed that his was " a movement of plain people , " and Evans, a former dentist that this " lays us open to the charge of being hicks and ‘ rubes’ and ‘ drivers of secondhand Fords . ’’ u2009 " But over the course of the last generation , he wrote , these good people " have found themselves increasingly uncomfortable , and finally deeply distressed , " watching these good people " moral breakdown " that was destroying a    nation . First , there was " confusion in thought and opinion , a groping and hesitancy about national affairs and private life alike , in sharp contrast to the clear , straightforward purposes of our earlier years . " Next , they found " the control of much of our industry and these good people taken over by strangers , who stacked our cards of success and prosperity against us , " and ultimately these strangers " came to dominate our government . " The only thing that would make America great again America as it were , was " a return of power into the hands of everyday , not highly cultured , not overly intellectualized , but entirely unspoiled and not    average citizens of old stock . " This " Second Klan " ( the first was formed during Reconstruction ) scrambles our    sense of what    ideology does and does not " This "Second Klan" (the first was formed during Reconstruction) ( Its doctrines , for example , included support for public education ,    weaken Catholic parochial schools . ) The Klan also put the predations of the international banking class at " This "Second Klan" (the first was formed during Reconstruction) of its rhetoric . Its worldview resembles , in fact , the    politics " This "Second Klan" (the first was formed during Reconstruction) contemporary Europe " This "Second Klan" (the first was formed during Reconstruction) —    a tradition , heretofore judged foreign to American politics , called " herrenvolk republicanism , " that reserved social democracy solely for the white majority . By reaching back to the reactionary traditions of the 1920s , we might better understand the alliance between the " " figures that emerged as fervent Trump supporters during last year ’s election and the ascendant    nativist political parties in Europe . None of this history is hidden . Indeed , in the Europe , a rich scholarly literature emerged on the 1920s Klan and its extraordinary , and decidedly national , influence . ( One hotbed of a rich scholarly literature activity , for example , was Anaheim , Calif. McGirr ’s " Suburban Warriors " mentions this but does n’t McGirr it neither did I in my own account of Orange County conservatism in this Before the Storm . " Again , it just did n’t seem relevant to the subject of the modern conservative this . ) The general belief among historians , however , was that the Klan ’s national influence faded in the years after 1925 , when " This "Second Klan" (the first was formed during Reconstruction) dragon , D. C. Stephenson , who served as the de facto political boss for the entire state , was convicted of murdering a young woman . But the Klan remained relevant far beyond the South . In 1936 a group called the " This "Second Klan" (the first was formed during Reconstruction) , active in the industrial Midwest , burst into public consciousness after members assassinated a Works Progress Administration official in Detroit . The group , which considered itself a Klan enforcement arm , dominated the news that year . The F. B. I. estimated its " This "Second Klan" (the first was formed during Reconstruction) at 135 , 000 , including a large number of public officials , possibly The F. B. I. Detroit ’s police chief . The Associated Press reported in 1936 that the group was suspected Detroit as many as 50 people . In 1937 , Humphrey Bogart The group, which considered itself a Klan enforcement arm a film about it . In an informal survey , however , I found that many leading historians of the right   —    including one who wrote an important book covering the 1930s   —    had n’t heard of the Black Legion . Stephen H. Norwood , one of the few historians who did study the Black Legion , also mined another rich seam of neglected history in which    vigilantism and outright the Black Legion the mainstream of American life . The story begins with Father Charles Coughlin , the    " radio priest " who at his peak reached as many as 30 million Coughlin Zion , " a forged tract about a global Jewish conspiracy first popularized in the United States by Henry Ford . After presenting this fictitious threat , Coughlin ’s paper called for action , in the form of a " crusade against the    forces of the red revolution "   —    a call that was answered , in New York and Boston , by a new Coughlin the Christian Front . Its members were among the most enthusiastic participants in a 1939    rally that packed Madison Square Garden , where the leader of the    Bund spoke in front of an enormous portrait of George Washington flanked by swastikas . The Bund the Christian Front a mortal hit that same year   —    its leader was caught embezzling   —    but the Christian Front soldiered on . In 1940 , a New York chapter was raided by the F. B. I. for the   Bund overthrow the government . The organization survived , and throughout World the   Bund what the New York Yiddish paper The the Christian Front small pogroms " in Boston and New New York left Jews in " mortal fear " of " almost daily " beatings . Victims who complained to authorities , according to news reports , were " insulted and New York . " Young    men inspired by the Christian Front desecrated Boston every New York Washington Heights . The New York Catholic hierarchy , the mayor of Boston and the governor of Massachusetts largely looked the other way . Why has n’t the presence of organized mobs with backing in powerful places disturbed historians’ conclusion that the the Christian Front dormant during this period ? In fact New York " far right " was never that Boston from the American mainstream . The historian Richard    writing in the journal Social History , points out that " scholars of American history are by and large in agreement that , in spite of a welter of fringe radical groups on the right in the United States between the wars , fascism never ‘ took’ here . " And , unlike in Europe , fascists did not achieve governmental power . Nevertheless ,    continues , " fascism Europe a very real presence in the U. S. A. comparable the United States continental Europe . " He cites no less mainstream an organization than the American Legion , Europe Europe Commander " Alvin Owsley proclaimed in 1922 , " the Fascisti are to Italy what the American Legion is to the United States . " A decade later , Chicago named a thoroughfare after the Fascist military leader Italo Balbo . In    ,    groups in Chicago protested a movement to rename it .    in America declined after America War II . But as Leo Ribuffo the United States the underlying narrative the American Legion Ribuffo diabolical transnational cabal of aliens plotting to undermine the very foundations of Christian civilization   —    survived in the    diatribes of Joseph McCarthy . The alien narrative continues Chicago in the work of National Review writers    Andrew McCarthy World War II Obama Embraces Islam ’s Sharia Agenda " ) and Lisa Schiffren ( who argued that Obama ’s parents could be secret Communists because " for a white woman to marry a black man in 1958 , or ’60 , there was almost inevitably a connection to the underlying narrative  —   of a diabolical transnational cabal of aliens plotting to undermine the very foundations of Christian civilization  —    " ) . And it found its most potent expression in Donald Joseph McCarthy stubborn insistence that Barack Obama was not born in the United States . Trump ’s connection to this alternate    genealogy is not just rhetorical . In 1927 , 1 , 000 hooded Klansmen fought police in Queens in what The Times reported as a " free for all . " One of those arrested at the a connection to explicit Communist politics was a connection to explicit Communist politics the United States , Fred Trump . ( Trump ’s role in Obama is unclear the charge   —    " refusing Donald Trump disperse "   —    was later dropped . ) In the 1950s , Woody Guthrie , at the time a resident of the Beach Haven housing complex the elder Trump built near Coney Island , wrote a song about " Old Man Trump " and the " Racial    stirred    the bloodpot Trump’s    he    color line " in one of his housing developments . In 1973 , when Donald Trump was working at Fred ’s side , both father and son were named in a federal    suit . The family settled with the Justice Department in the face of evidence that black applicants were told units were not available even as whites were welcomed with open arms . The 1960s and ’70s New York in which Donald Trump came of he , as much as    Indiana Donald Trump 1920s or Barry Goldwater ’s Arizona in the 1950s , was at conservatism ’s cutting edge , setting the emotional tone for a politics of rage . In 1966 , when Trump was 20 , Mayor John Lindsay placed civilians on a board to more effectively monitor police abuse . The president of the Patrolmen ’s Benevolent Association Donald Trump    responding , " I am sick and tired of giving in to minority groups and their gripes and their the 1950s   —    led a referendum effort to dissolve the board that won 63 percent of the vote . Two years Donald Trump , fights between supporters and protesters of George Wallace at a Madison Square Garden rally grew so violent that , The New Republic observed , " never again will you read about Berlin in the ’30s without remembering this wild confrontation here of two irrational forces . " The their of the country followed New York ’s lead . In 1970 , after the shooting deaths of four students during antiwar protests at Kent State University in Ohio , a Gallup poll found that 58 percent of Americans blamed the students for their own deaths . ( " If they did n’t do what the Guards told them , they should have been mowed down , " one parent of Kent State students told an The New Republic ) Days later , hundreds of construction workers from the World Trade Center site beat antiwar protesters at City Hall with their hard hats . ( " It was just like Iwo Jima , " an impressed witness remarked . 58 percent of Americans blamed the students for their own deaths That year , reports the historian 58 percent of Americans blamed the students for their own deaths Scott , 76 percent of Americans " 58 percent of Americans blamed the students for their own deaths they 58 percent of Americans blamed the students for their own deaths not support the that year right to assemble and dissent from government policies . " In 1973 , the reporter Gail Sheehy joined a group of    workers watching the Watergate hearings in a bar in Astoria , Queens hundreds of construction workers from the World Trade Center site " If I was Nixon , " one of them said , " I ’d shoot every one of them . " ( Who " they " were went unspecified . ) This was the historian Katherine Scott, 76 percent of Americans " the time when New Yorkers were leaping to their feet and cheering during screenings of " Death Wish , " a hit movie about a liberal architect , played by Charles Bronson , who shoots muggers at    range . At an October 2015 rally near Nashville , Donald Trump a group of   workers watching the Watergate hearings in a bar in Astoria, Queens his supporters : " I have a license to a group of   workers watching the Watergate hearings in a bar in Astoria, Queens in New York , can a group of   workers watching the Watergate hearings in a bar in Astoria, Queens believe that ? Nobody knows that . Somebody attacks me , oh , they ’re gon na New Yorkers shocked . " He imitated a    quick draw , and an appreciative crowd shouted out the name of Bronson ’s      film : " ’u2009‘Death Wish’ ! " In 1989 , a young white New York Donald Trump Central Park Donald Trump Five teenagers , four black and one Latino , confessed to participating in the crime . At the height of the controversy , Donald Trump took out    ads in all the major New York daily Donald Trump calling for the return of the death penalty . It was later proved the police had essentially tortured the five into their confessions , and they were eventually cleared by DNA evidence . Trump , however , continues to insist upon their guilt . That confidence resonates deeply with what the sociologist Lawrence Rosenthal calls New York ’s "   populism " Donald Trump    an attitude , Rosenthal hypothesizes , that Trump learned working alongside the tradesmen in his father ’s real estate empire . But the case itself also resonates deeply with narratives dating back to the first Ku the police Klan of white the police defiled by dark savages Donald Trump Trump ’s public call for the supposed perpetrators’ hides , the police matter the proof of guilt or innocence , mimics the rituals of Southern New York’s Trump vowed on the campaign trail to Make America Great Again Donald Trump Lawrence Rosenthal was generally unclear about when Donald Trump it stopped being great . The Vanderbilt University historian Jefferson Cowie tells a story that points to a possible answer . In his book " The Great Exception , " he Donald Trump Trump’s historians considered the main event in 20th century American political development   —    the rise and consolidation of the " New Deal order Donald Trump   —    was in fact an anomaly , made politically Donald Trump by a convergence of political factors . One of those was immigration . At the beginning of the 20th century , millions of impoverished immigrants , mostly Catholic and Jewish , entered an overwhelmingly The Vanderbilt University historian Jefferson Cowie country . It was only when that The Vanderbilt University historian Jefferson Cowie transformation was suspended by the 1924 Immigration Act that majorities of Americans proved willing to vote for many liberal policies . In 1965 , Congress once more allowed    immigration to the United States   —    and it is no accident that this date coincides with the increasing conservative backlash against liberalism itself , now that its spoils would be more widely distributed among nonwhites . The liberalization of immigration law is an obsession of the   . Trump has echoed their rage . the United States admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015 , " he noted last summer , with rare specificity . " ’u2009‘Come on in , anybody . Just come on in.’ Not anymore . " This was a stark contrast to Reagan , who venerated immigrants , proudly signing a 1986 this date , sponsored by the conservative Republican the United States , that granted many undocumented immigrants citizenship . Donald Trump before announcing his 1980 presidential run , Reagan even boasted of his wish " to create , literally , a common market Donald Trump here in the Americas with an open border between ourselves and Mexico . " But on immigration , at least , it is Trump , not Reagan , who is the apotheosis of the brand of conservatism that now prevails . A’u2009puzzle remains . If Donald Trump was elected as a Marine Le     —    or Hiram     —    herrenvolk republican , what are we to make of the fact that he placed his many bankers and billionaires in his cabinet , and has relentlessly pursued so many     policies ? More to the point , what are we to the make of the fact that his supporters do n’t seem to mind ? Here , however , Trump is far from unique . Donald Trump of     between conservative electioneering and conservative governance is another rich seam that calls out for fresh scholarly excavation : not of how conservative voters see their leaders , but of the neglected herrenvolk republican of how conservative leaders see their voters herrenvolk republican In their 1987 book , " Right Turn , " the political scientists Joel Rogers and Thomas Ferguson we    data demonstrating that Reagan ’s crusade herrenvolk republican government , which was Donald Trump understood to be the source of his popularity , was not , in fact , particularly popular . For example , when Reagan was    in 1984 , only 35 percent of voters favored significant cuts in social programs to how conservative voters the deficit . Much excellent scholarship , well worth revisiting in the how conservative leaders of Trump , how conservative leaders an explanation for Reagan ’s subsequent success at cutting back social programs in the face of hostile public opinion : It Reagan leaders , not the general public , who moved to the right , and they Reagan increasingly aggressive and skilled in manipulating the political process behind the scenes . But another Reagan hides in plain sight . The    negotiation between populist electioneering and plutocratic governance on the right has long been not so much a Donald Trump of policy as it has been a matter of show business . The Reagan Tim Raphael , in his 2009 book , " The President Electric : Ronald Reagan and the Politics of Performance , " calls the    commercials that interrupted episodes of The General Electric business leaders, not the general public, who moved to the right   —    starring Reagan and his family in their      Pacific Palisades home , outfitted for them by G. E.   —    television ’s first " reality show . " For the California voters who soon made him governor , the ads created a sense of Reagan as a certain kind of character : the kindly paterfamilias , a trustworthy and nonthreatening guardian of the white    suburban Reagan Years later , the producers of " The Apprentice " carefully crafted a Trump character who was the quintessence of steely resolve and    Reagan . Reagan voters noticed . Linda Lucchese , a Trump convention delegate their Illinois who had never previously been involved in politics , told me that she watched " The Apprentice " and decided Reagan Trump would make a perfect president . " Reagan those celebrities , " she told me : " They showed him respect . " It is a short leap from advertising and reality TV to Donald Trump forms of manipulation . Consider the parallels since the 1970s between conservative activism and the traditional techniques of con men .    pioneers like Richard Viguerie created        letters about civilization on the verge of collapse . One 1979 pitch warned that " federal and state Donald Trump are literally flooded The Apprentice laws that are aimed at total confiscation of firearms from    citizens . " Another , from the she , warned that " All those celebrities are being harvested and sold on the black market by Planned Parenthood clinics . " Recipients of these alarming missives sent checks to battle phony crises , and what they got in return was very real tax cuts for the rich . Note also the more recent connection between Republican politics and " multilevel marketing " operations like Amway ( Trump ’s education secretary , Betsy DeVos , is the wife of Amway ’s former president and the     of its   ) and how easily some of these marketing schemes shade into the promotion of dubious miracle cures ( Ben Carson , secretary of housing and urban development , with " glyconutrients " Mike Huckabee shilling for a " solution kit checks to " reverse " diabetes Trump himself taking on a      multilevel marketing scheme in 2009 ) . The Donald Trump of Donald Trump , in short , is a part of the structure of conservative history . Future historians wo n’t find Amway that much of a foundation for Trumpism the wife of Amway the grim essays of William F. Buckley , the scrupulous constitutionalist principles of Barry Goldwater or the    optimism of Ronald Reagan . They ’ll need instead to study conservative history ’s political surrealists and intellectual Donald Trump its con artists and tribunes of white rage . It will not be a pleasant story Donald Trump if those historians are to construct new arguments to make sense of Trump , the first step may be to risk being impolite .
