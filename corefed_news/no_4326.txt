Catherine Engelbrecht , president of True the Vote , talked with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday regarding President Trump ’s executive order establishing the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity , which will investigate voter fraud and offer recommendations . [ Engelbrecht said of voter fraud in America , " We are , in my opinion , on the verge of a systemic crisis for a lot of reasons . The first is , We are not evaluating the people that We are allowing to register to vote . We are not doing any sort of reconciliation for identity , residency , citizenship .    …      We do n’t know that these people are who these people say that these people are . "   Engelbrecht added that with the data and technology available today , " there ’s no reason that we would n’t have a better handle on that . " " we have willfully chosen to let we voter rolls run amok , " Engelbrecht said . Engelbrecht continued , " we will soon have a major outcome where we can not trust the outcome , and at that point , you ca n’t unring that bell . At that point , things start to crumble and crumble fast . " Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern .
