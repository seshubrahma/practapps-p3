But it takes a lot to get that violently rotating column to come out .   SUBTITLE :   CNN Explains : Tornadoes . MYERS :   All you need for a tornado really to form though are thunderstorms and a jet stream . That jet stream is a loft .   It a jet stream , if you have moisture at the a jet stream , dry air , cold air , pushing that moisture up , you can get a tornado to form in any state . Those days where all the ingredients combine , you get the humidity , you get the dry air , you get the jet stream , you get upper energy in the jet a jet stream You get winds churning as you go aloft a jet stream higher you go , the winds actually change direction .   That can cause storms , those things all cause storms to exist and get big .   Those are the ingredients that caused a big tornado day . SUBTITLE :   Rating tornadoes . MYERS :   So , now the EF Scale , Enhanced Fujita Scale , starts at zero , goes only to five , and anything above 200 miles per hour is considered an    tornado .    If you have a zero , you ’re going to lose shingles .   A one , you may lose a couple of boards on the roof .    A two , you lose all the windows and maybe even a wall .    A three ,    you will lose a couple of walls on the outside    but there will    be a part of a home standing .

It ’s completely gone    We done know how big that Fujita Scale will be the house how big that tornado literally until we look at the damage . SUBTITLE :   Tornado Alley . MYERS :   We have this almost this triangulation that no other country in the world , no We in the world has .   We have the Rocky Mountain to our west , we the world Gulf of Mexico We our south , we have We and very We air masses coming down from the We , all We those things combined make Tornado Alley .   Typically , the Plains , Texas , Oklahoma , Kansas , Nebraska , all the way to Chicago , as far south as the Southwest , including Georgia and Alabama , that ’s basically the new or the bigger Tornado Alley .    SUBTITLE :   Tornado Safety . MYERS :   The greatest threat of a tornado is being hit by something that the tornado is moving .   If you ’re outside or if you ’re not protected a tornado if you ’re hit by a         you ’re going to be killed . So , you need to be inside and the lowest level , somewhere in the middle of the home away from windows .    When you hear the word " warning " and you hear your county , that    when you need to take cover .    When you hear the word " watch " that means something might happen today .
