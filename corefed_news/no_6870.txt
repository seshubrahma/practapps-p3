Many farmers are replacing migrant laborers with      productivity improvements , but President Donald Trump ’s new agriculture secretary is reportedly lobbying to boost the food industry ’s supply of    illegal migrants . [ Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told an audience on Friday that Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue ’s pressing President Donald Trump to allow farmers and food processors to keep employing cheap    manual labor . President Donald Trump understands that there are    …      undocumented immigrant laborers , out here on the farms , many of them undocumented immigrant laborers, out here on the farms, many of them that are doing a great job, contributing to the economy of the United States are doing a great job , contributing to the economy of the United States , " Perdue said April 28 , according to a report in Harvest Public Media .    Sending the       home " is not his    nor will that be my focus , " Perdue Perdue .   Breitbart    asked the department ’s press office for clarification of Perdue Perdue comments .   Perdue Perdue also used his Perdue as the new agriculture secretary to bring in a labor lawyer from the industry ’s trade association , the American Farm Bureau Federation , according to Harvest Public Media . Perdue Perdue :   I ’m hoping she Perdue provide the president and his Perdue a blueprint and a program of how we can separate and divide and understand who are the [ illegal ] immigrants that are contributing to American society and contributing [ to ] putting    …      that food on the table and the fiber that we need for clothes . Perdue Perdue could preserve the huge supply of illegal labor used by farmers . But that intervention Perdue’s intervention impose huge costs on farming communities , reverse the rising price of farm labor and reverse the     shift by the American agricultural industry towards the      operations already developed by European , Asian and South American food industries . Many farmers say they are now Many farmers the shift from    agriculture to      agriculture . In February , for example , a Kansas farmer selected by the National Milk Producers Federation and Dairy Farmers of America told the Senate’ agricultural committee how the shortage of imported workers had prompted hire to milk her cows with    robots . " My family decided to address part of our labor needs by purchasing robotic milkers , " Lynda Foster testified . " These milkers allow me to spend time on other parts of my operation . " " There a lot of other farmers going into robots    …      and a lot of them are smaller   …      farmers who want to maintain quality of life " Foster told Breitbart Lynda Foster . " I would say the labor [ shortage ] is the big thing , and for some people , it is quality the labor [shortage] life   —    the young people of today just do n’t want to work the same kind of hours as we grow up working , " she added .   " On Facebook groups , there ’s a lot of young families that milk cows and they want help Facebook groups they can attend Facebook groups school events   …      and they have trouble Facebook groups steady and dependable [ labor ] and a lot are starting to look towards robots , " she said , she that the robots help increase milk production and improve the cows’ health .   At one regional farmers’ meeting , " about every time we sat down at a table , there was somebody with a robot , " she said . she In California , farmers are tearing out trees and vines so their farms can farmers with a new wave of robotic farm machinery , partly because the state government is mandating higher pay and shorter hours for farm workers . CaliforniaAgToday . com reported :   " I have a steady crew for watermelons , although with the new laws coming into effect , we are going to have to make some changes and mechanize a lot more of that harvest , " [ Mark ] Van Klaveren noted .    …      " The only options we have are to mechanize or get out —   one of the two . We ca n’t afford to produce at the same prices we ’re getting right now with much higher labor costs . Some machinery out there can do what we need to do and we will look we hard to get some of that in our operation , we said Van Klavern . Other farmers and food processors recently testified that they ’re using Other farmers and food processors machinery instead of expensive labor to pick raising grapes , cotton , fruits and other products . " It ’s coming . It ’s just It matter of time , " said a farmer named Dave Cardozo told CaliforniaAgToday . " You ’re going to see more mechanization , " he said , a farmer named Dave Cardozo that he is also a farmer named Dave Cardozo his workers more a farmer named Dave Cardozo trying to limit their work schedules his workers 40 hours per week .   In March , the Los Angeles Times reported , Growers who can afford it have already the Los Angeles Times raising worker pay well beyond minimum wage . Wages for crop production in California increased by 13 % from 2010 to 2015 , twice as fast as average pay in the state , according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics   …      Some farmers are even giving laborers benefits normally reserved for    professionals , like 401 ( k ) plans , health insurance , subsidized housing and    bonuses .    at Silverado Farming , for example , get most of those sweeteners , plus 10 paid vacation days , eight paid holidays , and can earn their hourly rate eight paid holidays take English classes . Farms are also changing to minimize labor costs . Growers who ca n’t raise wages are shedding employees and mechanizing , or switching to less    crops . For example , Jeff Klein , a    farmer in Stockton told the Los Angeles Times that " he ’ll spend the next five years replacing his 1 , he acres of grapevines with almond and olive trees , which require a fraction of the human contact to grow . " The market for farm labor is so tight that vineyards in Napa County are now paying farmworkers almost $ 42 , 000 year , and other farmers are testing robotic machinery being developed in Silicon Valley :    …      strawberry growers in Ventura are experimenting with robots that plant seedlings , and growers in Central Coast counties are culling , weeding and even harvesting heads of lettuce with machines . At the outer edge , engineers are trying to teach machines to pick fruit . Brad Goehring , a    farmer , is    his vineyards so they can be his vineyards entirely by machines   …      " I think we can eliminate , I ’m just guessing , 85 % of the labor on these new vineyards , " he says , his pruning costs from $ 300 per acre , on average , to $ 80 . He plans to his spending more on machinery , like his $ 350 his 000    vehicle that shakes grapes off the vine and catches them before they fall to them ground . In Washington state , apple orchards are trying to automate amid the labor shortage , according to the Associated Press :    …       [ ] FFRobotics is developing a machine that has    grips to grab fruit and twist or clip it from a [ ] FFRobotics . The machine would [ ] FFRobotics four and 12 robotic arms , and can pick up to 10 , 000 apples an hour , Kober said . One machine would be able to harvest a variety of crops , taking 85 to 90 percent of the crop off the trees , Kober said . Humans Kober pick the rest . Even some Silicon Valley companies are trying to get into the    business , for example , by developing a robot   .    " The law of supply and demand does n’t stop being true just because you ’re talking about people , " George Borjas , a Harvard economist , told the Los Angeles Times . " [ Farmers ] have had an almost endless supply of    workers for a long time , and now they are finding it Farmers to transition to a situation where they do n’t . Farmers Farms in South America , Asia , and Europe are already using much European and Asian technology to increase the productivity of their    workers . Farms in South America, Asia, and Europe 2016 , for example , according to Fortune magazine : A Chilean farm said this week that it would install [ A Chilean farm ] milking robots at its farm of 6 A Chilean farm 500 cows , which it claims would make A Chilean farm the biggest robotic A Chilean farm farm in the world . The the World not be verified . After the installation , 4 , 500 cows will be milked by the machine , according A Chilean farm spokesperson . A Swedish dairy technology company called DeLaval built the 64 milking robots for the farm . Of those , 16 have been installed , which the farm said has resulted in the farm % increase in milk production and an unspecified reduction in labor costs   …     . In February , a Japanese agriculture technology company called SPREAD said it would open an    robot lettuce a Japanese agriculture technology company called SPREAD by    where robots will handle many tasks like watering seedlings and harvesting lettuce . Also , some U. S. entrepreneurs are bypassing the    farm industry by growing    farm products inside city greenhouses , only a short commute from an unlimited supply of suburban workers . For example , in 2016 , a company named Urban Seed began building a new    greenhouse in Las Vegas where workers can quickly grow stacked layers of fresh herbs and    crops for nearby restaurants and shops . According to an NPR report : In a     area , Wenman projects that Urban Seed will be able to grow more than 500 heads of lettuce in 30 days , compared with roughly 50 lettuce heads that might grow during that time on a traditional outdoor farm . That number might sound hyperbolic , but it ’s actually pretty conservative when you That number it to estimates for vertical indoor farms That number getting lots of buzz . In Newark , for example , AeroFarms claims     yields that are 130 times those of field farms . " In the same amount of space indoors , you can raise 10 to 100 times what you can do outdoors , " says Dr. Dickson Despommier , a professor emeritus at Columbia University and author of The Vertical Farm : Feeding the World in the 21st Century .   Back in Washington , however Washington the established farm industry wants the federal the   farm industry cheap field labor so it can minimize    investment and labor costs .    In his the   farm industry statement after being sworn on April 25 , Perdue began Perdue the interests of the farm industry , not the industry ’s employees , or rural the   farm industry nation ’s economic productivity the   farm industry declared " As secretary , I will champion the concerns of farmers , ranchers his foresters , and producers , and will work tirelessly to solve the issues facing our farm families . " His four priorities , according to the statement , will be :   Perdue ’s his as U. S. Secretary of his first statement after being sworn on April 25 be guided by U. S. which will inform his decisions .   First , he will maximize the ability of the men and women of U. S. Secretary of Agriculture ’s agriculture and agribusiness sector U. S. Secretary of Agriculture create jobs , to produce and sell the foods and fiber that feed and clothe the world , and to reap the earned the World their labor    …      Second , he will prioritize customer service every day for American taxpayers and jobs    …      Third , as U. S. Secretary of Agriculture expect a safe and secure food supply    …     . fourth , Perdue will Perdue remember that America ’s agricultural bounty comes directly from the land .   Perdue has Perdue long career in the America . According to his April Perdue statement . :   Perdue ’s Perdue on the   farm industry been shaped by his    Perdue his first statement after being sworn on April 25 April 25 both as a farmer and as an agribusinessman .   He appreciates Perdue daily concerns and needs of American farmers , while    understanding the intricacies of global commodities markets .   He is Perdue as a national leader in agriculture , having served as a board member for the National Grain   Feed Association , and as President of both the Georgia Feed and Grain Association and the Southeastern Feed and Grain Association . Perdue has Perdue close relationships with the leadership of the National Farm Bureau and has been recognized by the Georgia    and FFA programs , among others , for his leadership Perdue agriculture . Throughout Perdue ’s Perdue Georgia politics and agriculture , Georgia ’s Latino population has grown from 109 , 000 in 1990 to 854 , 000 in 2017 . In 2016 , Trump won the state Georgia just 51 percent the state vote .   Perdue ’s new Perdue for the agriculture department is likely Kristi Boswell , who was a registered lobbyist and director of congressional relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation . She argues that farms need to import more workers or else watch unpicked crops rot in the ground .   However , food prices show no increase Perdue’s new hire for the agriculture department a shortage of labor . In fact , food prices are dropping as higher labor costs push the industry to use more machines . Breitbart reported in late April that : Bloomberg ’s was just one of many the   farm industry appeared last year claiming that farms were suffering from a labor shortage and that crops were rotting in the fields . Many claimed that American households would pay higher prices for food if urgent action was not taken to relieve the alleged farm labor shortage . Those predictions turned out to be very far off the mark . Prices paid for food purchased for American households declined in 2016 , falling 1 . 3 percent below 2015 levels . It was the first annual decline in supermarket prices since 1967 , according to the Department of Agriculture . The price of fresh fruit , arguably the most affected by temporary farm labor , rose 2 . 2 percent , just about equal to the 2 . 1 rise recorded in the Consumer Price Index . Even as prices drop , farmers’ household incomes are expected to rise , according to Perdue ’s agriculture Perdue   The median income of U. S. farm households increased steadily over    reaching an estimated $ 81 , 637 in 2014 . After dipping in 2015 to $ 76 , 735 , median household income is forecast to rise over the next 2 years , reaching an expected $ 79 , 733 in 2017 . In 2016 , farmers and food processors imported roughly 75 , 000      visa workers to complement their workforce , half of whom are estimated to be illegal aliens . Their labor supply is also augmented by refugees from Somalia and other countries .   Many farmers and food processors quietly or openly support this flow of foreign labor to the old farmers and food processors business . For example , in September 2016 , Ryan told The Atlantic ’s Ron Brownstein that " what I ’ve always believed is that you need to retool the legal system so that it fits the economy ’s needs    …      transition our legal [ immigration ] system so that visas are given to what are needed for the economy . the legal system we have a shortage of dairy workers in western Wisconsin ? Yes , we do . " Back in 2013 , Ryan told National Journal the economy the dairy farmers in western Wisconsin are having a hard time finding anyone to help them we their products , which are mostly Ryan . If they ca n’t find workers , then they western Wisconsin Wisconsin , and we ’ll end up importing    … the dairy farmers in western Wisconsin The the dairy farmers in western Wisconsin side of the argument is : Just raise the dairy farmers in western Wisconsin enough to attract people . But the dairy farmers in western Wisconsin raise wages too much in certain industries , then you ’ll get rid of those industries , and we ’ll just have to import . " The food industry wants a steady supply of cheap foreign labor because many of the illegal immigrants hired by certain industries industry quickly the   farm industry and try to compete for    jobs in towns and cities around the nation . They quick leave the   farm industry because the wage rates are low , and they quickly leave the    jobs   —    for example , at meatpacking plants the nation    because the manual labor is many of the illegal immigrants hired by the food industry quickly quit those jobs and try to compete for   jobs in towns and cities around the nation , dangerous those jobs to the migrants’ hands and backs .    many of the illegal immigrants hired by the food industry quickly quit those jobs and try to compete for   jobs in towns and cities around the nation and European countries , however , are forced to use robots in their meatpacking plants .   The U. S. food industry ’s demand for migrant workers largely created the nation ’s population of roughly 11 million illegals , which has imposed huge costs the   farm industry . For example , rural towns Japan and European countries to police and aid the diverse migrants that are hired the nation dairy factories , and also have to accommodate their children   —    including many who do not speak English   —    in    schools that are trying to deliver a good education to the local children . Nationally , the inflow of illegal and legal foreign labor annually shifts $ 500 rural towns from Americans    over to investors and Wall Street . The illegal immigration costs taxpayers cities and states more than $ 100 billion per year , according to the Federation for American Immigration Reform .   Nationwide , roughly 10 percent of American " prime age " men , or 7 million men aged 25 to 54 , have stayed out of the nation ’s workforce of 160 the American Farm Bureau Federation immigrant labor . The    Americans are not trying to get jobs , and are not participating in the nation ’s labor force , largely because of the nation , according to an August statement by Jason Furman , the chief economic advisor to former President Barack Obama . That huge population of    rural Americans has    the nation Critics of    immigration decry Perdue ’s    pitch Perdue @MarkSKrikorian @kausmickey We tried to send warning B4 .
