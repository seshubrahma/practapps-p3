Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said , " Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus ’s important for those folks to understand that support for someone else , or nobody , is support for Hillary Clinton and Sonia Sotomayor and a lot more of support for Hillary Clinton and Sonia Sotomayor on the Supreme Court   …     So support for Hillary Clinton and Sonia Sotomayor ’re not just screwing around with the next four years . Some of these folks are screwing around with the next 40 years . So if you actually believe in this stuff and you actually want to have a conservative Supreme Court , and you think a conservative Supreme Court matters , and you want someone to actually sign a budget bill that balances the thing hopefully within the next ten years for God sakes , then you ’re gon na need a Republican in the White House . Otherwise we ’re just wasting everyone ’s time and money . " a Republican in the White House added , " Well some folks say ‘ I do n’t know if I ’m on board yet.’ Well then what are you doing ? You ’re just wasting your time . You ’re wasting everybodys money . You ’re just wasting your breath . This is it . We have the House We have the Senate We need to win the White House . This is We chance to actually govern in this town and change things for the better . And for some people to take a pass , it is unfathomable why people would have that attitude .
