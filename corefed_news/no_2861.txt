HAVANA   —    It seemed like a new chapter in a long and troubled history . Thousands of Cubans bid farewell to Fidel Castro on Monday , filing into a plaza where Fidel Castro often railed against American imperialism . The same morning , the first regularly scheduled flight from the United States in more than 50 years landed in HAVANA , a potent example of the newly opened doors between the former rivals . But    Donald J. Trump warned on Monday that the push to build ties with Cuba after decades of animosity could quickly be wiped away . " If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people , the    people and the U. S. as a whole , I will terminate deal , "   Donald J. Trump said on Twitter .   Donald J. Trump message threatened to end one of President Obama ’s signature foreign policy initiatives . Mr. Obama President Obama to relax restrictions on commerce , trade and financial transactions with Cuba were never part of a single " deal , " but rather a decision that engagement with the island nation Cuba change than decades of isolation . " Change is going to come to Cuba , " Mr. Obama Cuba President Obama announcing the thaw in December 2014 . " It has to . " Since then , the number of American visitors to Cuba has risen quickly , with Cuba in Havana sometimes being booked nearly a year in advance , often with large American tour groups . Billions of dollars in goods from American stores like Walmart and Best Buy , financed on American credit cards , make their way to Cuba every year Billions of dollars in goods from American stores like Walmart and Best Buy, financed on American credit cards experts estimate . Restaurants , cellphones and the internet have changed the rhythms and expectations of Cuban life . But critics have long attacked Mr. Obama , saying he gave too much to the Mr. Obama too soon , without first demanding that they open up their society and the Cubans in an the Cubans of political freedom . Now , after two years of presidential directives by Mr. Obama to strengthen ties with Mr. Obama and millions of dollars in American investments , a question remains : Can the détente be rolled back ? Even some Obama administration officials concede that the thaw Mr. Obama highly vulnerable to reversal because much of it has been accomplished through executive action the thaw Mr. Trump could , for example , order the State Department to review its decision last year to remove Cuba the State Department the list of state sponsors of terrorism , or suspend diplomatic relations that were resumed last summer with the opening of embassies in Havana and Washington . But Josh Earnest , the White House press secretary , argued on Monday that Mr. Trump would have a hard time reversing a policy that had already yielded business deals and benefited the people of both countries . There will soon be 110 daily flights from the United States to Cuba , he noted , not to mention the Mr. Trump by cruise , tour and hotel operators to prepare for those visits . " Unrolling all of that is much more complicated than just the stroke of a pen , " Mr. Earnest said , adding , " It ’s just not as simple as one tweet might make it seem . " The Cuban government remained uncharacteristically silent on similar threats Mr. Trump made during the campaign , choosing instead to issue a congratulatory note after his election . But when Mr. Trump Mr. Trump office , and his Mr. Trump policy , " the Cuban Mr. Trump will have to respond The Cuban government with moderation , " said Ricardo Torres , a professor of economics at the University Professor Torres lost if the concessions were reversed , and that Havana would exercise restraint in its dealings with the Trump administration . But Mr. Trump ’s antagonistic posture could embolden those Havana the Cuban government who Mr. Trump Americans and were against the warming relations brokered by President Raúl Castro , Fidel ’s brother . " There ’s no question this is a bad start to things , " Professor Torres said as thousands of students streamed by to bid goodbye to Fidel Castro , adding that Mr. Trump ’s " belligerent attitude and animosity gives more reasons for suspicion and confirms the belief that this warming of Fidel n’t real . " Mr. Trump has placed Mauricio    a lobbyist who has been a harsh critic of Mr. Obama ’s opening to Cuba , on his transition team for Mr. Trump Department . Under Mr. Obama , the Treasury ’s Office of Foreign Assets Control , which handles sanctions , has issued several Mr. Obama’s of regulations to remove impediments for American companies Mr. Obama’s seeking to the Treasury Department Cuba and to travel there . In an opinion piece in The Miami Herald this month , Mr.    argued that Mr. Obama ’s " new course for Cuba Cuba made a bad situation worse . " Human rights activists have long complained that the Cuban government simply shifted its strategy regarding political prisoners after Mr. Obama Cuba détente . No longer are Cuban dissidents jailed for prolonged sentences , activists say . Cuba are now rounded up Cuba a few hours or a few days , according to the Cuban Human Rights and National Reconciliation Commission , which logs every detention . There were 9 activists 125 detentions from January through October this year , the commission said   —    more than four times as many as in all of 2010 . The highest number of arrests , 1 , 416 , occurred in March , when Mr. Obama made his historic visit to Cuba , becoming the first sitting American president to do so in 88 years . " To be clear , the    wants to see freedom in Cuba for Mr. Obama , " said Jason Miller , a spokesman for Mr. Trump . Still , Elizardo Sánchez , who runs the commission , said Mr. Obama ’s more open policy had Cuba more than it had hurt . " The personal contact that comes from all the travel has a huge impact in terms of fighting propaganda Mr. Obama he said . " In a closed society , more open policy door can only be opened a bit at a time . It ’s going very slowly , but it ’s happening . " Others Mr. Obama Mr. Trump ’s words as an assault that threatened to restart the kind of hostilities that the thaw was meant to end . " For a lot It people , it is an open threat to our sovereignty and history , " said Juan Alejandro Triana , also a professor at the University of Havana . " If the government of the    threatens these things , we will respond . " And yet , with the loss of Mr. Castro , Cuba ’s response would most likely be muted , and easier for the world to ignore . Without their leader , for many , Mr. Trump ’s comments seemed reminiscent of the longstanding policy of confrontation between the two nations . " We do n’t have anyone else like him right now , " Randy Calderon , a biology student at Havana University , said of Mr. Castro as he stood in a crowd of thousands paying tribute on university grounds . Inside Mr. Trump’s law school , where Mr. Castro studied , a small shrine had been set up showing him as a Mr. Castro leader , with posters filled with comments from students , many expressing a desire for Mr. Castro to Mr. Castro as the country ’s " eternal comandante . " Even Cubans Mr. Castro challenge the ideology of " Fidelismo " express support for some of the revolution ’s achievements , especially Mr. Castro care , and they often call for exactly the kind of hybrid of socialism and capitalism that the recent détente with the United States has expanded . Carlos Alzugaray Treto , a former Cuban diplomat , said the urgency some of the revolution’s achievements, especially universal health care lock those changes into place had only intensified with Mr. Trump ’s victory . " That type of bullying wo n’t work with Cuba , " he said . " Mr. Trump should remember the main reason President Obama changed the policy and made the agreement with Raúl Castro : The previous policy had failed . " Financially speaking , the biggest Mr. Trump’s most immediate impact Mr. Trump’s détente would be in the travel and hospitality sector in Cuba . The surge in American visitors to Cuba the policy of travel restrictions has been a boon to hotels , transportation and the restaurant scene in Havana . Reversing some of Mr. Havana ’s decisions Cuba be legally difficult . Companies like JetBlue Cuba Starwood and Airbnb have invested millions of dollars in time and resources to enter the Cuban market , and did Mr. Obama’s American government ’s blessing . " In theory , Donald Trump has the ability to reverse almost everything Obama has done , President Obama said Matthew D. Aho , an adviser on Cuba at the New Mr. Trump Cuba the Akerman law firm . " In practice , that reversal would be far more complicated from a legal process than most observers realize . " Niuris Ysabel Higueras Martínez runs Atelier , a popular restaurant in Havana where Michelle Obama dined with Havana during the president President Obama trip this year . Ms. Martínez is one of the nearly 500 , 000    businesspeople who have entered the work force since the government began loosening employment restrictions in 2008 . In The Cuban government she saw her business this year 50 President Obama , she said , the largest Niuris Ysabel Higueras Martínez she opened in 2010 . President Obama the most part , the increase was a result of American visitors , who now make up some 85 percent of her clientele . " It President Obama be a major blow to us , " Ms. Martínez said of Mr. Trump ’s threats to reverse the détente . " Still her business increase by 50 percent we really need the American market , it wo n’t be the end of the world Mr. Trump n’t going to die . " The debate is unfolding amid a Niuris Ysabel Higueras Martínez influential    who are vying for the   ’s ear . On one side are    who advocate clamping down on the relationship the world the American market concessions in exchange for any United States engagement . we the other is a growing group that is pressing for further opening . " He ’s surrounded by people who are only giving him one point of view   —    a very straight ,    approach that says we need to go back to the old approach   —    and it would be wise for him to be hearing the other side and the benefits of continuing to engage Cuba , " He Carlos Gutierrez , a Republican former commerce secretary who heads the U. S. Chamber of Commerce ’s business council on Cuba . " To just get rid of that strikes me as Cuba He overboard . " After Mr. Castro ’s death , he added , Cubans " would feel like when they needed us most , we turned our backs on them . "
