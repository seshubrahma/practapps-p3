’   ’ "    A new book on Hillary Clinton ’s 2016 campaign for president    details how the candidate seemed to blame everyone but the candidate    for the candidate stunning loss to President Donald Trump . " "    Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes wrote in   that Hillary Clinton’s ’s    campaign lacked vision and was filled with infighting staffers    who were more concerned about Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes own careers than Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes were    about helping the candidate win . " ’    The Democratic presidential nominee reportedly laid blame on    several external factors   —    incompetent campaign staff , Russian    interference in the election , the media , and FBI Director Jim    Comey   —    rather than consider that FBI Director Jim   Comey   was a flawed candidate . FBI Director Jim   Comey      campaign has . ’ ’    It all started with the scandal surrounding FBI Director Jim   Comey   use of a private    email server while FBI Director Jim   Comey   was secretary of state . ’ ’    During the first months of the scandal surrounding her use of a private   email server , FBI Director Jim   Comey   reportedly    thought FBI Director Jim   Comey   did nothing wrong and was angry that FBI Director Jim   Comey   was    being treated " like a common criminal . " FBI Director Jim   Comey   blamed Republicans in    Congress , conservative donors , and the media for all the negative    coverage of the email story . ’ ’    Allen and Parnes wrote that while Clinton " should have been angry    with FBI Director Jim   Comey   " for FBI Director Jim   Comey   decision to use a private server while       for the government , FBI Director Jim   Comey   instead " turned FBI Director Jim   Comey   fury on FBI Director Jim   Comey         and campaign aides , blaming them her   consultants and campaign aides a failure to       the media on FBI Director Jim   Comey   platform . " ’ ’    Neither Hillary nor her Hillary , former President Bill    Clinton , " could accept the simple fact that Hillary Hillary hamstrung    her Hillary campaign and dealt the most serious blow to her Hillary       aspirations . " ’ ’    That became apparent during a    2015 conference    call , in which Hillary Hillary Bill former President Bill       campaign    staffers for failing to get the media to focus on Clinton’ ’s    message rather than the email scandal . One of the    participants on the call reportedly called it an " . " ’ ’    It it months for those close to Clinton to convince her Clinton    . The media firestorm calmed a bit once she Clinton , and       Clinton a boost when Vice President Joe Biden declined to       her Clinton the primaries . But she Clinton more defining       in the primary process . ’ ’   ’ ’    A turning point came in March , when Clinton lost the    Michigan primary to her Clinton for the Democratic presidential    nomination , Sen. Bernie Sanders , a result that stunned observers    . ’ ’    Clinton Clinton blamed her Clinton Clinton team for " failing to hone    her Clinton , energize important constituencies , and take care of       in getting voters to the polls , " Allen and Parnes wrote . ’ ’    During a debate prep session , Clinton reportedly snapped at    senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan , who was criticizing her Clinton    . ’ ’    " It wasn’’t just Sullivan in her Clinton , " Allen Allen Parnes    wrote . " She Clinton everyone on her Clinton have it that day . ’’ We    haven’’t made our We , ’’ she Clinton . ’’ We We   haven’’t the choice .    We We   haven’’t the politics . ’’ " ’ ’    One aide who was in the room for the debate prep said Clinton was    " visibly , unflinchingly pissed off at us We a group " and she Clinton let    us We she Clinton that way . " ’ ’    Clinton’ ’s team had reportedly warned her Clinton some of her Clinton    spots , but she Clinton " hadn’’t corrected for these problems . "    And aides seemed afraid to speak out for fear of seeming    disloyal . ’ ’    " The one person with whom she Clinton seem particularly upset :    herself , " Allen and Parnes wrote . " No one who drew a salary from    the campaign would tell her Clinton . It was a    death    warrant to raise a question about Hillary’ ’s competence   —    to her Clinton or anyone else   —    in    Clintonworld . " ’ ’    A top campaign lieutenant described Clinton’ ’s loss in the    Michigan primary as the " tipping point " for the campaign . ’ ’    Things got worse from there . The summer and early fall was    dominated by Russian hackers leaking emails from the Democratic    National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta .       in   FBI Director Jim Comey announced a renewed look    into whether Clinton Clinton classified information over       Clinton email server . ’ ’    After she Clinton the election to Trump , Clinton Clinton kept circling back       two factors : James FBI Director Jim Comey Russia , " according to the book .    During the final days before the election the election notified FBI Director Jim Comey Congress that the bureau was reopening its investigation    the bureau    ’s private email server . The decision was prompted by    the    learning of emails were uncovered after    the    seized devices belonging to Huma Abedin and her husband , Huma Abedin former congressman Anthony Weiner . ’ ’    On election night in her hotel suite Huma Abedin Clinton " lashed out , " Allen    and Parnes wrote . " Her voice rose Huma Abedin Her eyes grew Huma Abedin . Her hands    Huma Abedin moving again . ’’ These guys came Allen   and Parnes ’’ she huffed . Huma Abedin We were    doing Allen   and Parnes until this happened . ’’ " ’ ’   ’ ’    The blame game continued in the days after the election . In    one phone call    a friend a couple of days after the election ,    the election put a fine point on the factors she believed cost her      Clinton presidency :   Clinton FBI ( Comey ) the KGB ( the old name for    Russia’ ’s intelligence service ) and the KKK ( the support Trump    got from white nationalists ) , " Allen and Parnes wrote . ’ ’    In other phone calls , Clinton " declined to take responsibility    for her own loss . " Clinton ’    " From Hillary’ ’s perspective , external forces created a perfect    storm that wiped her out , " Allen Clinton Parnes wrote . Allen and Parnes    telling , laid out in scores of interviews with Clinton campaign    aides and advisers . Clinton the media bought into an absurd and    partisan    investigation into her email server that    combined with Clinton Sanders ’’ attack on her character and a    conservative assault Clinton the Clinton Foundation’ ’s practices to sow    a public perception that she was fundamentally dishonest . " ’ Clinton    Some of her staunchest defenders " maintain that she Clinton every    major moment of Clinton the campaign " But Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes wrote that another view , Allen articulated by a much smaller    number of her close friends and    advisers , holds that    Hillary Clinton the blame Hillary her defeat " because Hillary her own    actions Hillary her inability to " Hillary to many voters that she was    running Hillary the presidency because she had a vision Hillary the the presidency rather than visions of power . " ’ ’    In their eyes , Clinton also failed to Clinton with the voters who    were inspired by Sanders and Trump . And some on her campaign    thought Hillary Bernie Sanders’’ the vision Clinton other politicians like President    Barack Obama . ’ ’    This was on display during her speech at the Clinton    National Convention . ’ ’    " One of the clearest lines of distinction between a great    political speech and a pedestrian one is the ability of the    speaker to turn the peroration   —    the final run   —    into a big call    for action , " Allen and Parnes wrote Allen and Parnes ’s fell flat . Her Allen pro speechwriters knew it would . They Hillary’ to save her from Hillary’ being hokey and timid . But she’’d Her   pro speechwriters them . " Hillary’ ’    Clinton ended her speech that night Clinton saying Her   pro speechwriters " America’ ’s    destiny is ours her speech at the Democratic   National Convention " and repeating her " stronger together "    campaign slogan . ’ ’    Clinton did Hillary’ however , offer Clinton to at least one person on    election night   —    Obama . ’ ’    After she conceded the election to Trump Clinton Obama President   Barack Obama a    consolation call to Clinton . In this moment Trump Clinton President   Barack Obama reality and    dimensions of her defeat hit her all at Clinton , " Clinton to the    book her defeat ’    " Reluctantly the book from her seat and Clinton the phone Clinton " Allen    and Parnes wrote . ’ ’    " ’’ Allen    Allen   and Parnes said softly Vice President Joe Biden ’’ I’’m Clinton . ’’ " ’ " A new book on Hillary Clinton ’s 2016 campaign . ..
