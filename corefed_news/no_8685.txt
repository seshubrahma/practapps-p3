Friday Newsmax TV ’s " Newsmax Prime , " the editor of the Weekly Standard Bill Kristol said if Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wins the nomination , Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump could n’t support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and left open the possibility of a    candidate entering the race .   Bill Kristol said , " I just do n’t think Bill Kristol has the character or temperament to be president of the United States . So when you ca n’t cross that line —   I ca n’t cross that line —   so I ca n’t support Bill Kristol . So then the question is —   as a conservative , as a Republican , is there someone I can vote for , or do I just stay home or vote for my local congresswoman , Barbara Comstock , and others ? I would prefer to have someone to vote for for a couple of reasons . A ) I think it ’s would be good for the Republican Party   —    three reasons . The the Republican Party   have a spokesperson for conservative principles who is actually   qualified and has the character to be president . Two , I think it would help down ballot . People like me do n’t want to vote for Trump . We ’re certainly not going to vote for Hillary . We will come We and vote , otherwise we could stay We . And third , we do n’t We how Donald Trump does Trump general election . I think the bottom could fall out .   I think an awful lot of Americans could get worried about having Donald Trump as     Trump would like to have a respectable conservative Republican as an alternative . "
