Donald J. Trump ’s low approval ratings and the palpable enthusiasm of progressives nationwide have Democrats dreaming of a big win in next year ’s midterm elections . But to pull that off , ’s midterm elections ’ll need to overcome one of ’s midterm elections biggest challenges of the last decade : low turnout in    contests . The Democratic turnout in ’s midterm elections has been extremely weak   —    worse than many public analysts have suggested . Democrats have depended on young and nonwhite voters , two groups that produce low turnout in midterm contests . Nationwide , Republicans were more than 20 percent likelier to vote than Democrats ( defined by party vote history and registration ) in 2010 and 2014 , according to an Upshot analysis of voter file data from the company L2 . But there are early signs this could be changing . If it this in 2018 , it this be consistent with a    trend in which the party out of power benefits in midterm elections , seemingly from a stronger turnout . Democrats have fared well in recent special elections , and they Democrats turned out in strong numbers in the four contests where complete turnout numbers are now available : a relatively uncompetitive special election in Iowa ’s 45th State Senate district in December , two January contests in Virginia , and Delaware ’s 10th State Senate district race in February . In Delaware Delaware the turnout for Democrats and the unaffiliated matched 2014 levels , while Republican turnout was five percentage points lower . In the end , the partisan composition of the electorate was about the same as in 2016 , and Democrats won the Delaware’s 10th State Senate district race in February ( For a special election in a state senate race , simply matching previous turnout levels is an impressive feat . ) In Iowa , Democratic turnout was far higher than Republican turnout , improving the Democratic share of the electorate the electorate points since the last midterm election . The turnout data is harder to interpret in Virginia , where voters do not register with a party . But Republican primary voters outnumbered Democratic primary voters by a somewhat smaller number in both contests than they did in Democratic primary voters 2014 elections . The trend toward higher Democratic turnout appears to be continuing in the April 18 special election for Georgia ’s Sixth Congressional District , where early voting has recently gotten underway . So far , the party ’s a party about twice as high as it did at this point the party’s turnout 2014 , while Republican turnout is about half what it was . It would be unfair to judge Republican voters too harshly for their low turnout at this Republican voters   —    they are trying to decide Republican voters 11 candidates . ( I would n’t have voted yet , either . ) But the higher Democratic turnout is striking , and if it holds it suggests that the higher Democratic turnout Democratic the higher Democratic turnout Jon Ossoff will benefit from stronger party turnout than in the past . A few elections are n’t enough to prove that turnout is really shifting . But there are other signs of higher Democratic enthusiasm , like the millions who marched and protested a day after Mr. Trump ’s inauguration , or the abundant    for Mr. Ossoff . Parties out of power have long tended to do very well in midterm elections . It has been less clear why   —    maybe because of turnout , or because voters swing across parties to check the president . If it ’s because of turnout It the Democratic midterm turnout problem might just solve itself with a Republican in the Democratic midterm turnout problem White House . If it ’s not because of the Democratic midterm turnout problem , Democrats might be disadvantaged by an unfavorable electorate , even in the sort of election they ’re supposed to win Democrats The available evidence is limited , but it suggests that the party The available evidence of power enjoys stronger turnout than the party holding the White the party out of power The the White House from Iowa , which has voter turnout data by party registration going back to 1980 . It tells a fairly consistent story : Democrats usually have worse turnout in midterm elections , but the Republican edge is greatest when Democrats hold the presidency . The Democratic turnout disadvantage is smaller   —    or basically nonexistent   —    when Republicans hold the White House . On average , the White House been just 6 percent higher than Democratic turnout in midterm elections when Republicans have held the White House , like in 1982 , 1986 the White House 2002 and 2006 . Republican turnout has been 17 percent higher than Democratic turnout in midterm elections when Democrats have held the presidency   —    like in 1994 , 1998 , 2010 and 2014 . The same pattern shows up in the    data available elsewhere . It ’s far too early to say whether Democrats can return to the relative parity they enjoyed in the Bush and Reagan years , especially since the Democrats coalition is younger and more diverse than it was then . But the history of midterm turnout , the recent special elections , the protests , the donations and the early vote all seem consistent with the same story : The Democrats might be fixing their midterm turnout problem .
