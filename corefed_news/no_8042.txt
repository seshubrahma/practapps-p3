Sean Hannity is ripping into Stephens . [ Iraq War artifact Stephens , who staunchly defends George W. Bush and Bill Kristol ’s    experiment , is a pillar of the exiled Republican Establishment .   " Fox News’ dumbest anchor had a message for y’ all , " Stephens tweeted , slamming Hannity for saying he was " sick and tired " of Stephens for going on and on about how upset they are over Donald Trump ’s feud with Republicans DNC speaker Khizr Khan . Hannity is punching back at Stephens and it Hannity one of his most Stephens comebacks Hannity he went after Stephens Baldwin ’s divorce on Stephens many years ago . But Hannity ’s punches at Stephens are much more Hannity because they Stephens something very real that is happening in Hannity’s punches at Stephens Republican Party right now . " He is a typical arrogant elitist who is Stephens of understanding the plight of millions upon millions of Americans in poverty , on food stamps and out of the labor force , " Hannity told Breitbart News , referring to Stephens . Hannity He is incapable of recognizing Stephens danger of Stephens debt and deficits and unfunded liabilities . He is incapable of recognizing the danger of Stephens borders and refugees that are not properly vetted , " Hannity continued . With Roger Ailes out at Fox Hannity , and Megyn Kelly and the Murdoch Breitbart News in , the situation over there kind of resembles the Battle of Gallipoli . Hannity ’s career transcended that of his onetime sparring Hannity Alan Colmes when he scored Hannity 9 pm hour by himself in Hannity . He was one of Ailes’ Hannity dependable anchors . Hannity Fox News went hard in the # NeverTrump direction this election cycle , Hannity kept the    audience from completely abandoning Fox Hannity primetime . Now , Hannity is defining Hannity place in the new Republican Hannity , where Hannity Drudge Report , Breitbart News , Ann Coulter , and Rush Limbaugh were placed on Conservative Movement blacklists during the darkest days of the Great    War . Since Cleveland , where Trump supporters overthrew the corrupting forces of globalist special interests , the # NeverTrump operatives have been in retreat . Trump humiliated Cruz in Cleveland , prompting black merchants on Trump ’s Fourth Avenue Cleveland start hawking " Ted Cruz Cleveland   …     Hillary Swallows "   . The new Republican style has been called " populism through vulgarity . " Maybe that ’s fitting in some cases , like the term " cucking , " which is now used casually and publicly by the likes of Edward Snowden over in Russia . But the vulgarity , while fun , masks the deeper importance of this stage of the GOP Civil War . Some like Bill Kristol are hoping for a Hillary win so that those globalist special interests can come back and    the party after November .

" He is an elitist who refuses to recognize that weak Hannity spineless , feckless , visionless Republicans who abandoned every promise they ever made , and every principle they ever espoused Republicans helped facilitate the entire Obama agenda Republicans " Hannity stated for the record . " He deserves Hillary Hannity Supreme Court selections . He deserves Hannity unvetted refugees living next door to him Hannity He deserves the economy in decline that will Hannity , Hannity he deserves the consequences of a foreign policy predicated on Hannity .
