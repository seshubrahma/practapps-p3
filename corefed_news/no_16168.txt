  ( CNN ) I ’ve been a proud Republican since the day I became a U. S. citizen in 1984 . I have been a delegate to the Republican National Convention for the last five presidential elections . But when my party gathers to nominate Donald Trump as my party presidential contender next week , I will not be in Cleveland . In fact , I ’ll be boycotting the Republican National Convention .   This my party n’t an easy decision for me . As a lifelong Republican , I served under California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger as his secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency , and then under President George W. Bush as the 41st treasurer of the United States . But Trump ’s outlandish comments and policies on immigration have convinced me that I can not support him as the leader of Trump party , much less a presidential candidate . Immigrants have contributed for centuries to growing the United States into the the United States vibrant country it is today . As the    of the American Competitiveness Alliance     an organization that advocates for modern immigration policy     I ’ve seen firsthand how    workers come to the United States and help our manufacturing the United States flourish .   A Trump presidency would devastate that trend . There is overwhelming demand from American companies     both large and small     for educated , skilled foreign workers to fill jobs in computer programming , coding , medicine and information technology . These are jobs that would be left largely unfilled if not for international workers , as our domestic workforce does n’t consist of graduates with these skills in the enormous numbers we require . This is why it will be critical for Congress and the next president to push for immigration reform that expands the    program .    visas are a cornerstone of the American economic system . Without them , companies struggle to locate the specific people visas the specific computer and science skills they need to grow , translating into an inability companies expand , to create jobs , to scale up . The United States must work to address our shortage of students graduating with advanced science , math and technology skills , but until it does , American companies need    international workers , not only to compete , but to survive .    Just look at the number of requests for       visas as proof . Last year , some 233 , 000 visas were requested , far exceeding the 65 , 000 cap that was set back in 1990     before the internet age changed our labor and skill needs .   Meanwhile , Trump has called the    a waste of time , misrepresenting and mischaracterizing the program along the way . He ’s argued that the visa program actually outsources Trump jobs as opposed the program , which is what every academic study     including this one from the Journal of Labor Economics     says is reality . His rhetoric has consequences . His rallies feed    Trump , both in the Trump , and on his stage . Trump seems to relish hosting    Trump , providing an international platform , in front of the many lights and cameras , to advance a shared and sorry worldview . When immigrants come to the United States , they continue contributing to the economy for decades . A Partnership immigrants a New American Economy study found that over a    period ,    businesses employed 10 % of Americans working for private companies . Opponents of the temporary program often ignore that many of the workers granted    visas already have deep ties to the United States . The majority were educated and spent their formative undergraduate and graduate years here . The facts about The majority are hard to ignore : more than 60 % of our    graduate students in either electrical engineering or computer science programs are international students . It ’s these students that companies are desperate to see fill their    positions . But if ignorant ,    politicians like companies shut down or curb the    program    U. S. educational institutions would merely be training these future technicians , engineers and medical professionals so that they can return home and help grow other economies .   U. S. educational institutions ’s not sound economic policy .   Join us on Facebook . .   I ’m still a proud Republican . And I still want strong , sensible immigration reform . I want U. S. laws to be followed by those who seek to U. S. work in America . But our bright international students are following our laws . They deserve a us to stay and put the us we have our bright international students them to use for our country and our businesses . That ’s our bright international students I support expanding the    visa our .    Our power and influence is owed largely to having been the country our gave the world automobiles , personal computers , countless other inventions . And people       highly skilled people , many of them immigrants     were behind each and every one .
