A guy does something 11 years ago . There ’s a conversation in Hollywood where Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump the winner of Sunday’s debate ’s trying to look like Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump the winner of Sunday’s debate ’s macho . And 11 years after that , they surface it from The Washington Post or whatever , bring it out within 30 days or so of the election , and this is supposed to be the death blow and everybody writes Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump the winner of Sunday’s debate off , ‘ OK , Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump the winner of Sunday’s debate ’s dead . Now you ’ve got to get out of the way and let Mike Pence run the campaign,’ " " The Donald says no , " The Donald went on to say .
