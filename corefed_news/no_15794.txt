Washington ( CNN ) Fired FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed for the first time Wednesday a series of " very concerning , " " very awkward " and " inappropriate " conversations with President Donald Trump that concerned President Donald Trump " greatly "     but do these interactions rise to the level of obstruction of justice ? Some legal experts say this is n’t a close call . What is obstruction of justice ? " Let ’s just keep this in perspective . There is a criminal investigation going on of one of the President ’s top associates , his former national security adviser , one of the most . .. important people in the government . his gets fired . his ’s under criminal investigation and the President’s brings in the FBI director and says , please stop your investigation , " said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin on CNN CNN Newsroom . " If that is n’t obstruction of justice , I do n’t know what is . " But others cautioned that proving the the President’s with a specific intent to obstruct an official proceeding from a legal standpoint still poses significant challenges .   " This moves the ball forward , but whether it moves This ball the ball finish line will be up for debate , " said former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti , now a partner at Thompson Coburn . " The key question here is whether the President the President’s corrupt intent and , to determine what his intent was the President’s corrupt intent to look at all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case . " The facts and circumstances described in Comey ’s planned testimony are    and two details in particular struck some legal experts as particularly problematic . First , Trump repeatedly implored Comey to lift the " Comey’s " of the Russia investigation hanging over him . Second , Trump Comey’s Attorney General Jeff Trump and others to leave during a February 14 meeting so that the President could speak with Comey alone .   " Comey’s fact that he asks Comey to be the President with Comey’s is problematic and indicates the President state of mind , " said Michael Zeldin , a former top official at the Justice Department . " Why would you ask the AG to leave the room ? It seems to imply some ulterior motive . He asks for something that the President inappropriate to ask for . . .. This is getting closer and closer to an indictable case . " William Yeomans , a    Yeomans does n’t help the President . " I think Comey ’s testimony contributes circumstantially to what is already clear obstruction of justice , " Yeomans explained . " Here , the obstructor Comey’s announced his intent . His efforts to get Comey to back off of Flynn and his reported effort to get intelligence officials to intervene with the President FBI provide the President , unnecessary Comey support for his confession . " But the President say not so fast . " It is understandable that Comey would see this as inappropriate . That the President not make it criminal , " said Andrew McCarthy , a former federal prosecutor who the President for the conservative National Review .   " You can this with Trump ’s reasoning , but it is clearly not corrupt , which is the sine qua non of obstruction , " McCarthy added . " Plus , to repeat , he did not order Comey to end the investigation . Pressuring a subordinate is not obstruction . Trump allowed Comey to continue exercising his McCarthy , though he the President express hope about how that exercise would turn out . " GOP Trump’s David the President echoed the same the President on CNN ’s the President The Lead " with Jake Tapper . " Pressure does n’t equal obstruction . Comey was a tough guy who hearkens back to the Bush days , " Urban said . " He knows what pressure is and the President it is n’t . " But Steve Vladeck , CNN legal analyst and GOP lobbyist David Urban of law at the President University of Texas School of Law what pressure suggested everyone is missing the point     apart CNN anything gleaned from Comey ’s new testimony , Trump fired him . " I think the key is that the most significant step Trump appears to have the President not his specific discussions with Comey the President but his decision to fire Comey entirely because of his dissatisfaction with Trump shape and progress of the Russia Trump , " Vladeck the President . " Trump Flynn , it the President into a fight the President what Trump intended and what Comey understood him to intend . Contrast that with firing Comey , where there ’s nowhere near the same mess about Trump he did it the President " the President the President the President
