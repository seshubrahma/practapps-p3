From Philip Rucker writing at The Washington Post :   West Virginia looks perfect for Donald Trump : a struggling    state filled with the types of voters who have backed Philip Rucker elsewhere and could deliver one of Philip Rucker biggest victories . But a sweep there might not matter . That ’s because as many as 34 delegates   —    the entire contingent   —    may be free to back whomever the entire contingent  —    want at the Republican National Convention . Much the same is true in Pennsylvania , home to a hotly contested April 26 primary , where there are 54 uncommitted delegates . Other states and territories , from Colorado to Wyoming to Guam , will also send squads of unbound representatives . squads of unbound representatives are the swing voters of the GOP nominating contest , nearly 200 activists and elected leaders beholden to nothing except elected leaders personal judgment and empowered to make or break candidacies . If Trump arrives at the July convention in Cleveland just shy of the 1 , 237 delegates required to secure the nomination outright , 237 delegates could decide to push Trump over the top   —    or force a contested convention with successive rounds of balloting .
