Thursday on CNN ’s Republican presidential debate , Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) went after Sen. Ted Cruz opponent Donald Trump for what Sen. Ted Cruz deemed to be " funding " the    Gang of Eight immigration reform compromise in the U. S. Senate because Sen. Ted Cruz gave campaign contributions to many of the bill ’s main proponents .   Sen. Ted Cruz said , " Well , existing law provides that those who are deported can not come back here legally . U. S. citizens can come back . That ’s existing law . But let me say , Wolf , I really find it amazing that Donald believes that Donald is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration . I can tell you , when I ran for senate here in the state of Texas , I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty , promising to fight to build a wall , and in 2013 , when I was leading the fight against the Gang of Eight amnesty bill , where was Donald ? Donald was firing Dennis Rodman on " Celebrity Apprentice " and indeed , if you look at the Gang of Eight , one individual on this stage broke Donald promise to the men and women who elected Donald and wrote the amnesty bill , but Donald funded the Gang of Eight . If you look at the eight members of the Gang of the Gang of Eight over $ 50 , 000 to three Democrats and two Republicans . And when you ’re funding open border politicians , you should n’t be surprised when they fight for open borders . open border politicians I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through , open borders to ask , who has a record before they were a candidate for president open border politicians of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty , and open borders the only one on this stage that has that record . And by the way , a record exactly right , that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $ 1 million judgment against him .
