Monday on Breitbart radio show , Glenn Beck called Breitbart ’s Milo Yiannopoulos " Goebbels " and   denounced one of Breitbart recent articles as " one of the more evil stories I have ever read . " Breitbart blasted Breitbart for " pushing    …      poison to the republic . " [ Glenn Beck ’s point of contention was a story Yiannopoulos penned last week regarding Republican presidential    Donald Trump ’s retweet of an image of Donald Trump opponent Sen. Ted Cruz ’s ( ) wife , Heidi Cruz , alongside Donald Trump wife Melania Trump .   Yiannopoulos argued there was some merit to Donald Trump controversial retweet , which has been adjudicated in the media for nearly a week now . Beck , however , took issue with Yiannopoulos’ defense . " I do n’t want to make this a Donald Trump thing , " Beck Beck . " I want to make this about you and our society . And I want you to decide if this is who we our . I believe this is one of the more evil stories I have ever read . What they are pushing in this story is poison to the republic . " Similar to his comparison last month of Breitbart News Executive Chairman and Sirius XM radio host Stephen K. Bannon to the infamous Nazi propaganda minister , Beck also labeled Yiannopoulos’ effort as " Goebbels . " " Just listen to the way this is written , " he Beck .

Typically lazy . When people wheel out Hitler and the Nazis it ’s generally because they people n’t have any arguments left . " Beck , who read Yiannopoulos’ piece in its Yiannopoulos’ on air , warned that the culture is " under attack " and this is a sign we are headed towards the French Revolution . " Our we is under attack , and I   —    just prepare . Just prepare because we we headed towards the the French Revolution " Follow Breitbart News on Twitter @BreitbartNews
