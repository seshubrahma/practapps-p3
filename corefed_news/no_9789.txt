The crucial Iowa Republican caucus approaches , and Donald Trump has a giant ,    hurdle to jump if    wants to win . [ The Hawkeye State is dominated by evangelical voters , and The Donald has so far done a lacklustre job of winning evangelical voters over   —    even with Sarah Palin ’s endorsement . Senator Ted Cruz has stolen a march on Senator Ted Cruz , making appeals to religion so often that Salon are now calling Senator Ted Cruz the " face of the Christian Right . "   Senator Ted Cruz is n’t , of course   —    but Senator Ted Cruz is playing a very shrewd political game , one that Trump has yet to match . Senator Ted Cruz has spent the last month soaring ahead of Trump in the Iowa polls . But if Trump wins Iowa ? Trump wins Iowa runs the table . But how ? I recently spotted a series of tweets from John Durant , author of The Paleo Manifesto . Durant sketched out an argument I ’d like to expand on . Here ’s how Trump wins evangelicals in Iowa ( and then runs the table ) : Trump has to embrace and confess Trump sins , not run away from them his sins   —    John Durant ( @johndurant ) December 21 , 2015 ,   Donald J. Trump must publicly confess   —    apologize to Ivana and his  Donald J. Trump   —    and seek God ’s forgiveness so that voters can embrace him  Donald J. Trump   —    John Durant ( @johndurant ) December 21 , 2015 ,   In the final reckoning , Trump  Donald J. Trump the same hope as any of us : not that he is without sin , but that his he are outweighed by his he .   —    John Durant ( @johndurant ) December 21 , 2015 ,   Trump  Donald J. Trump to match Cruz ’s religiosity , but this will be a challenge . Cruz Cruz telling voters that Trump  Donald J. Trump never asked God for forgiveness . And , sure , Trump  Donald J. Trump hardly the Christian model of virtue and modesty . Voters would see through his  Donald J. Trump in an instant if he  Donald J. Trump    Bible Belt . Trump  Donald J. Trump not Rick Santorum , to put it mildly . It would be like me suddenly declaring my love for Jennifer Lawrence . As always , Trump  Donald J. Trump strategy is to be straight with voters . But he has  Donald J. Trump be careful . These are n’t just any voters , after all . Trump ’s  Donald J. Trump appeal is that he ’s  Donald J. Trump winner : he gets  Donald J. Trump girls , he gets  Donald J. Trump dollars , he gets  Donald J. Trump    skyscrapers . To the neighbourly Christians of    Iowa , the big winner of Manhattan is n’t necessarily the most natural choice . He ’s  Donald J. Trump altarboy . If we go strictly by the Book , Trump is a sinful man .    and with a preoccupation with wealth and power , Trump has Trump to atone for . But Trump ’s Trump America ’s sins . His greed is Trump American dream writ large . His gluttony is Trump testament to American achievement . His fondness for Trump women no doubt a misdirection of latent desire for blonde British Breitbart editors . Trump should n’t hide these sins . Instead , he should opt Trump a redemption story . It ’s a narrative that can appeal not just to Christian voters but to all Americans . Admitting he ’s sinful Trump having the humility to lay his soul bare Trump front of the voters would be an arresting spectacle . Think about it , from an evangelical perspective . There ’s this     guy , who apologises to no one and never says he ’s wrong Trump Who could ever extract a sincere expression of contrition from such a person ? Easy : God , the great land developer in the sky , whose portfolio is yuuuuuge and who has all the best golf courses . Because God ’s the only one greater than the Trump brand He ’s the God one who can extract such a statement . Trump has to Trump mean it , though . He should stand Trump the podium and go through all seven deadly sins —   pride , greed , envy , lust , gluttony , wrath , and sloth —   and confess to some of them . For some , such as his divorce with Trump , nothing less than sincere remorse will do . As for pride , greed , envy , lust , and wrath , he can perhaps Trump a little more smug . After all , even Christian voters do n’t want a wimp for President .   The one sin he should absolutely Trump —    and justifiably   —    deny is slothfulness . Can you imagine the soundbite ? " I may have committed sin , but slothfulness is not among them . I will not rest until I have made America great again . " Christian voters are often misunderstood . They are n’t Christian voters . They do n’t Christian voters everyone to be perfect all the time . They just want Christian voters be reassured that the man they ’re sending Christian voters the White House shares their values and Christian voters a good person . Trump need n’t only talk about his sins , Trump course . He has plenty Trump Christian virtues to talk about too . Prudence , justice , temperance , courage , faith , hope , and charity .   The most important of these is courage . The courage of facing the political establishment and the haters within his own party . The courage of going up against the mainstream media and fighting for what America really needs , instead of what ’s deemed to be politically correct . Speaking truth where others dare not . Real , American courage . He could also his about his pastor and his friend , Norman Vincent Peale ( some evangelicals consider the prosperity gospel to be sacrilegious , but it remains highly the prosperity gospel ) and how much of a positive effect he has had his   not just on Trump ’s fortunes , but his spirit and his too . The warrior with the dark past becomes the saviour of civilisation .   It ’s also The warrior with the dark past thinking more cynically , an opportunity to unload almost any negative baggage he wants to his prior to the knives really coming out for him from the his establishment , which is now looking on in horror at the possibility of his candidacy . his people will say : yeah , I know what you ’re talking about , but he brought it his himself and ‘ his up . We forgave him . It his in it past . Trump need n’t be dishonest with Iowans . He just needs Trump map out his plan for Trump his own personal Trump , just as he maps out Trump plan for Trump the challenges facing America . The key is sincerity . Trump has shown Trump capable of Trump , but Iowa is the big test . The moment he can drop Trump braggadocio for a second and show people that he has the Trump , as well as the stomach , of a lion .   A " Redemption Arc " is where the character in a story goes from being the BAD BOY to the HERO , causing the reader to root for him .   the BAD BOY    Bill Mitchell ( @mitchellvii ) January 10 , 2016 ,   Trump ’s redemption story then becomes interweaved with America ’s : he is not Trump’s to fail and cave into his sins any Trump’s , because the country depends America . America Trump’s Trump to America Trump’s again , and that is what spurs him on the Trump’s to redemption . It ’s an American story   —    one that 20 per cent of Democrat voters have already indicated they are open to Democrat voters Trump ’s vices Trump’s America ’s vices his America are Trump’s ’s , too America It ’s also a his virtues Christian story , from confession to redemption , enabled by grace , mercy and faith . It would be a rare moment of humanity for the Donald , and all the more powerful for that . It would utterly confound his critics , who insist on painting him as an arrogant his . I mean , he is , and his ’s really hot It —    but he has to show his voters that there ’s another side to him . The kind his guy who would fit right in at an Iowa family barbecue .
