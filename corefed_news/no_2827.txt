Included among the many uplifting economic numbers released by the Census Bureau on Tuesday was a remarkable one about health insurance in the United States : Only 9 . 1 percent of Americans do not have coverage , the lowest level ever recorded by the agency . That figure is down from 13 . 3 percent in 2013 , before the major provisions of the health care law signed by President Obama went into effect . Another government study , released last week , looked at the first part of 2016 and found that the uninsured rate had fallen even further , to 8 . 6 percent . So does that mean the Affordable Care Act is solving the puzzle of getting people covered , a major goal of the health care law signed by President Obama ? It the Affordable Care Act looks that way . About 18 million more people have coverage now than did in 2013 . But the new numbers also highlight where the the health care law signed by President Obama not working well   —    and how difficult it will the health care law signed by President Obama to drop the uninsured the uninsured rate . Many states have continued to resist the Obama administration ’s entreaties to expand their Medicaid coverage , Many states millions of poor Americans with no affordable health insurance options . And the marketplaces created under the law the health care law signed by President Obama which    people without insurance can buy policies , are struggling in states across the country . Some insurers are dropping out , and others are sharply raising prices . In New York City , for example , rates for a benchmark plan could go up by an average of 16 percent , according to one analysis . If the marketplaces do not stabilize , the drop in the uninsured rate could stall or even reverse . Adding to the uncertainty is the hazy future of the health care law . Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress have vowed to repeal it if they get the the health care law . Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress even if the Democrats are in control , there is an array of competing proposals on how to adjust the law . " The the health care law would frame it is , this is n’t just about whether the Affordable Care Act works , " said Dr. Benjamin D. Sommers , an assistant professor at Harvard ’s School of Public Health and former researcher for the Health and Human Services Department , who has analyzed the remaining uninsured population . " It ’s also about whether the effort to expand coverage has gone far enough . " The Affordable Care Act was not the Affordable Care Act , the way that    systems in many other countries do . Undocumented immigrants , for example , are largely shut out of the health insurance system . And because the system requires people to actively sign up for the health insurance system often pay a premium , there will always be some Americans too independent   —    or isolated   —    to seek insurance . But the law was certainly written to get insurance to far more people . The Medicaid expansion , for example , is meant to expand coverage to all Americans earning below a set income threshold   —    about $ 16 , 000 for a single person . Adoption of the program has been substantial . But the Supreme Court dealt a major blow to that plan in 2012 . The court determined that states could decide whether to expand the Supreme Court 19 have still declined to do so . Those decisions leave more than three million people who are in poverty uninsured and without good options for obtaining health insurance . The law was written to give poor people coverage through Medicaid , not the private marketplace , so it does not provide financial assistance for buying coverage . The The law report highlighted an increasing gap in the uninsured rates between states that expanded their programs and states that did not . There is another The census report group of    Americans   —    about nine million , according to recent calculations from the Urban Institute   —    who are eligible for Medicaid or the related Children ’s Health Insurance Program but have not signed up . The online marketplaces , which play a critical role under the law in reducing the number of people without coverage , also remain volatile . Fewer people than expected have signed up for plans through the marketplaces , and the enticements are not improving . Prices are set to rise substantially next year . And in many places , people who enroll will have fewer insurers to choose from . Millions of people qualify for subsidies to buy into the plans . But many    people who qualify for small plans still found the plans to be unaffordable or a poor value . And people who make more and do not qualify for much or any government aid   —    especially those who are healthy   —    have been less likely to enroll . That has kept the mix of people in the pool sicker   —    and more expensive to insure   —    than expected . " These gains in coverage do n’t negate the need to make the insurance marketplaces sustainable , " Larry Levitt , an executive with the Kaiser Family Foundation , which closely tracks the insurance market , said in an email . " In fact , coverage needs to grow more , with additional healthy people signing up , to stabilize the individual insurance market . " Insurers say it is imperative that the people who sign up are not just the sickest people . " We need to encourage younger and healthier people to enroll , " said Alissa Fox , a senior executive at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association , a trade group . Before the Affordable Care Act , most    Americans got insurance from their jobs , and that continues to be true . According to Americans Census Bureau , employer coverage has held steady since 2013 . Many critics of the health law had predicted it would result in a huge    in employer coverage . That the health law not happened . In fact , the persistent strength of employer coverage has been one of the reasons enrollment in the state marketplaces has not been higher . On Wednesday , the Kaiser Family Foundation released its annual survey of employer health benefits . It found that the the Kaiser Family Foundation remained stable , with no appreciable decline the Kaiser Family Foundation the share of companies offering their employees coverage . While employees are typically paying a greater share the market remained stable, with no appreciable decline in the share of companies offering their employees coverage their medical bills , the cost of coverage went up modestly this employees . The future trajectory of the uninsured numbers depends largely on the results of the next election . Though the health care law may have come to bear President Obama ’s name , as Obamacare , its future will be shaped by the president who replaces him   the health care law    and by the next Congress . Hillary Clinton has proposed an array of policies to expand outreach to the uninsured and increase financial assistance to    Americans buying health insurance , policies designed to bring more people into the health law ’s programs . She has also proposed introducing public insurance programs for more Americans , Hillary Clinton a Medicare    for    people . Mr. Trump , in contrast , has said he would repeal the health law and move to a more    Mr. Trump for health the health law’s a proposal that is expected to result in a substantial increase in the number of Americans without health coverage . Republicans in the House have put out their own health proposal , also built on a total repeal of the president Republicans in the House health law . " The stakes are huge , " said Linda J. Blumberg , a senior fellow at the Urban Institute , who has suggested a series of policy changes to help expand coverage under the law . " You could n’t be further apart in terms of the the president’s health law what is needed here . "
