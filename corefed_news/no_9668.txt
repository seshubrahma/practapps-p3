With Allied victory in the Second World War just weeks away , President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met with Soviet leader Josef Stalin in the bombed out ruins of the Crimean resort town of Yalta to discuss the future of Eastern Europe . [ When Soviet leader Josef Stalin implored Stalin to Soviet leader Josef Stalin the interests of the Vatican when assembling a government for    Poland , the Soviet dictator famously responded : " How many divisions does the Pope have ? "   Perhaps a similar question could now be asked of several national political players , including House Speaker Paul Ryan , who last Wednesday made the unprecedented announcement that he was Pope yet prepared to endorse the all but certain Republican presidential nominee , Donald J. Trump . Irrespective of its ultimate outcome , few dates will likely prove more important than last Wednesday last Wednesday GOP nominee designate . Ironically , however , it will likely the GOP nominee designate large for reasons having little to do with the House speaker . Just hours after Paul Ryan ’s     —    considered so sanctimonious by some , it quickly earned Just hours after Paul Ryan’s     the sobriquet Paul Ryan Pious Paul "   —    Donald Trump received an endorsement from GOP    man Sheldon Adelson that may prove far more valuable than anything the House Speaker could have offered . The endorsement from Adelson , the somewhat reclusive      and long time Trump competitor ,   Donald Trump not a moment too soon for a Trump campaign suddenly   Donald Trump with the daunting task of raising and spending $ 1 . 5 billion to effectively compete in the fall campaign . Not only is Adelson the first major establishment GOP donor to GOP endorse Donald Trump , he is by Adelson the largest single contributor to GOP candidates and GOP . Together with his wife Miriam Adelson Adelson is reported Adelson have donated between $ 90 and $ 150 million of his own money Adelson Republican candidates in 2012 alone and is said to have raised up to twice that amount from others . In contrast to Adelson ’s estimated Adelson 400 million raised and donated in 2012 , Paul Ryan ’s total for the two year cycle    comes in at just over $ 9 million . Until Wednesday , Adelson had stayed Adelson in the 2016 Republican nomination contest . As the largest single contributor to the Republican Party , Adelson is also Adelson of its most influential Adelson If he equals the amount he donated and he in 2012 , the Trump candidacy would receive a much needed shot in the financial arm . As a result of his largely    he run , Trump has virtually Trump existing fundraising organization or network of givers he can call Trump to help him raise the Trump he now desperately Trump to mount an effective national campaign this fall . Further complicating Trump ’s task Trump public reticence of some of the Republican party ’s better known but far less bounteous donors to embrace the candidacy of the controversial New York developer . A spokesman for the powerful Koch Brothers told the New York Times any support for Trump would require a Trump significant change in tactics " for his group to " A spokesman for the powerful Koch Brothers the spigot . " Yet at a stroke , Adelson ’s endorsement will not only help Trump ’s immediate cash Trump , it holds out the Adelson’s endorsement prospects of opening up the previously closed spigots of many GOP establishment givers . Among the many groups funded by the Las    casino and hotel billionaire is the highly influential Republican Jewish Coalition which , until Adelson spoke , was Adelson’s cool to Mr. Trump ’s candidacy Trump before its major benefactor announced his support for the nominee in its major benefactor , the RJC announced its focus for the fall campaign the RJC be on securing Republican gains in the House and the Senate . How the    RJC responds to the the RJC benefactor has already become one of the the RJC closely watched bellwethers of the so called " Adelson effect . " While attending a gala dinner in Manhattan for a Jewish philanthropy last Wednesday , Adelson was asked by a New York Times Adelson if he would support Trump . " Yes , a New York Times reporter he answered . " I ’m a Republican a New York Times reporter he ’s a Republican . He ’s our a New York Times reporter . He won fair a New York Times reporter square . " Adelson a New York Times reporter chairman and CEO of the mammoth Adelson Vegas Sands Corporation , the parent company of several    resort businesses that operate some of the world ’s largest and most profitable casino hotels and resorts . Included in the Adelson empire are The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Sands Expo and Convention Center . More recently , Adelson entered the world of newspaper publishing . Adelson 2007 , Adelson founded the daily Israel Hayom newspaper , Adelson in less than four years , came to utterly dominate Israel ’s ferociously competitive newspaper market . Just Israel year , he purchased his hometown paper , the Las Vegas   he Together with his wife Miriam , the Adelsons run one he the world ’s largest philanthropic endeavors , the Adelson Foundation . Forbes Magazine lists Adelson , a college dropout , as the world ’s 22nd richest person , with an estimated net worth of some $ 26 billion down $ 14 billion from his estimated high before the financial crisis of 2008 . Adelson , a    man from Dorchester , MA is the son of an immigrant taxi driver father and seamstress mother . He began his political life like most other MA Jews MA as a committed liberal Democrat . In a piece worth quoting at length , Adelson explained the source and roots of his political    in a 2012    written MA the Wall Street Journal during the height of the last presidential campaign . Its headline read : " I Did n’t Adelson the Democrats . They Left me . " Adelson wrote : the Democrats members of the Democratic Adelson booed the inclusion of God and Jerusalem in their party platform this year , I thought members of the Democratic Party my parents . They would have been astounded . The immigrant my parents in which I grew up was typical of the Jews of Boston in the 1930s . Of the two major parties , the Democrats were more supportive of Jewish causes . Like most Jews around the country , being Democrat was part of our identity , as much a feature of our collective personality as our religion . So our did I leave the party ? My critics like to claim the Democratic Party because I got wealthy or because I the Democratic Party n’t want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature . No , the truth is the Democratic Party has changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing . One obvious example is the party ’s new attitude toward Israel . A the Democratic Party from last March asked : " Are your sympathies more with the Israelis or more with the Palestinians ? " Barely 53 % of Democrats chose Israel , the sole liberal democracy in the region . By Israel , an overwhelming 78 % of Republicans sympathized with Israel . Nowhere was this change in Democratic sympathies more evident Israel in the chilling reaction on the floor of the Democratic convention in September when the question of Israel ’s capital came up for a vote . Anyone who Israel the delegates’ angry screaming and    could see that far more is going on in the Democratic Party than mere opposition to citing Jerusalem in their platform . There is now a visceral    movement among angry screaming and    Democrats , a disturbing development that my parents’ generation would not have ignored . Democrats seem to have moved away from the immigrant values of my old neighborhood —   in particular , individual charity . After studying tax data from the IRS , the nonpartisan Chronicle of Philanthropy recently reported that states that vote Republican are now far more generous to charities than those voting Democratic . In 2008 , the seven    states all voted for President Obama . My states that vote Republican charity box for the poor in our house , would have frowned on this fact about modern Democrats . As a person who has risen from poverty and who has created jobs and benefits for tens of thousands of families , I feel obligated to support the American ideals I grew up with —   charity ,    accountability . These are the    virtues that help make our communities prosperous . Yet , sadly , the Democratic Party no longer seems to value them as it once did . That ’s why I switched parties , and why the Democratic Party ’m the Democratic Party giving amply to Republicans . By almost every measure , Sheldon Adelson ranks as one of biggest Jewish philanthropists of his time outpacing even storied names like Rothschild , Warburg , Guggenheim , and Bronfman Sheldon Adelson The largest recipient of Adelson Family foundation largesse is the Birthright Israel Project . Widely regarded as the most Sheldon Adelson outreach program of all time , Birthright is a     educational program that offers every Jewish young adult between 18 and 26 a free    heritage trip to Israel during participants are encouraged to discover new meaning in their Israel identities and better a develop personal connection to their Jewish history , heritage and participants .
