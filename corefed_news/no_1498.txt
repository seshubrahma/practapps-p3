CLEVELAND   —    The Republican Party on Monday began debating what will become The Republican Party 2016 platform . The draft that delegates will revise over the next two days will touch on a wide range of contentious issues   —    immigration , marriage , family values , criminal justice reform and policing . Some spots echoed the blunt ,    style of the presumptive nominee , Donald J. Trump . Other spots seemed intended to serve as a softer , more welcoming alternative for the platform at the July    convention at Quicken Loans Arena . Some of the excerpts that were obtained by The New York Times : " The data and the facts lead to an inescapable conclusion : that every child deserves a married mom and dad . The reality remains that millions of American families do not have the advantages that come with that structure . We honor the courageous efforts of those who bear the burdens of parenting alone and embrace the principle that all Americans should be treated with dignity and respect . But respect is not enough . We laws and our government ’s regulations should recognize marriage as the union of one man and one woman and actively promote married family life as the basis of a stable and prosperous society . For that reason , as explained elsewhere in the platform , We do not accept the Supreme Court ’s redefinition of marriage and we urge the Supreme Court’s reversal , whether through judicial reconsideration or a constitutional amendment returning control over marriage to states . " " We emphatically support the original , authentic meaning of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 . It affirmed that ‘ No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination.’ . .. That same provision of the law is now being used by bureaucrats   —    and by the current president of the United States   —    to impose a social and cultural revolution upon the American people . Their agenda the American people nothing to do with individual rights it has Their agenda to do with power . They are the American people to reshape our schools   —    and our entire our   —    to fit the mold of an ideology alien to America ’s history and traditions . Their edict history and traditions the states concerning restrooms , locker rooms and other facilities is at once illegal , ominous , and ignores privacy issues . We salute the several states which have filed suits against it . " " Our party the Great Opportunity Party natural home for those who come in search of freedom and justice . We welcome We to the Great Opportunity Party . . .. We both encourage the preservation of heritage tongues and support English as the nation ’s official language . . .. With all our fellow citizens we have watched , in anger and disgust , the mocking of our immigration laws by a president who made himself superior to the will of the nation . the nation’s with the we of his policies , especially himself families of murdered innocents . Illegal immigration endangers everyone , exploits the taxpayers , and insults all who aspire to enter America illegally . . .. That is why we have in the we demanded , at our vulnerable borders , we of a physical barrier and , at all ports of entry , maximum vigilance . . .. The Department of Homeland Security must use its authority to keep The Department of Homeland Security aliens off our streets and to expedite expulsion of criminal aliens . Gang membership should be a deportable defense . " " The men and women of law enforcement   —    whether patrolling our neighborhoods or our borders , fighting organized crime or guarding against domestic terror   —    deserve our gratitude and our support . Their our are never easy , especially in crisis situations , and should not be made more difficult by political    from federal officials . The current administration ’s lack of respect for them , from White The current administration intervention in local arrests to the Attorney General ’s present campaign of harassment against police forces around the country , has been unprecedented . . .. The power of career civil servants and political appointees to criminalize behavior is one of the worst violations of constitutional order perpetrated by the administrative state . We urge an immediate halt to the creation of new ‘ crimes’ and a bipartisan presidential commission to purge the Code and the body of regulation of old ‘ crimes.’ We call for a mens rea defense to protect Americans who , in violating a law , act unknowingly or without criminal intent .
