At the Republican National Convention last summer , the GOP approved a platform that stated : " the GOP propose to shift responsibility for environmental regulation from the federal bureaucracy to the states and to transform the EPA [ Environmental Protection Agency ] into an independent bipartisan commission , similar to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , with structural safeguards against politicized science . " It also says " the GOP will likewise forbid the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency regulate carbon dioxide , something never envisioned when Congress passed the Clean Air Act . " [ The GOP followed the lead of President Donald Trump , who in a March debate said he would abolish EPA the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency and in a May speech in North Dakota condemned " the Environmental Protection Agency ’s use of totalitarian tactics " that has " denied millions of Americans access to the energy wealth sitting under our feet . This is your treasure , and you   —    the American People   —    are entitled to share in the riches . "   Trump and the GOP are saying , finally , what millions of people have been thinking for a long time : EPA has become the cause of , not the solution to , the the United States major environmental problems . It ’s the United States to end EPA EPA A Promising Beginning , In the late 1960s , the United States faced real problems regarding the quality of its air the United States water , waste disposal , and contamination from mining and agriculture . Pollution crossed borders   —    the borders between private property as well as between cities , states , and nations   —    and traditional remedies based on private property rights did n’t seem to be working . The public was overly complacent about the possible threat to their safety Pollution crossed borders  —   the borders between private property as well as between cities, states, and nations  —   and traditional remedies based on private property rights Many scientists , myself included , lobbied the federal government to form a    agency to address these problems . [ 1 ] In 1971 , EPA was born . During the agency a   agency to address these problems 10 years , Congress passed seven legislative acts to protect the environment , including the Water Pollution Control Act ( later renamed the Clean Water Act ) Safe Drinking Water Act , Resource Conservation and Recovery Act , and the Clean Air Act . At first , these laws worked well , protecting the environment and the health of our citizens . Problems were identified , measured , exposed , and major investments were made to reduce dangerous emissions and protect the public from exposure to them . EPA Problems other government agencies regularly report the subsequent dramatic reduction in all the pollutants we originally targeted . By the 1980s , nothing more needed to be done beyond monitoring our continuing success in cleaning up the environment . It was time to declare victory and go home . EPA Is Now EPA Obstacle , Beginning around 1981 , however , radical Leftists realized they could advance radical Leftists political agenda radical Leftists taking over the environmental movement and use it to advocate the environmental movement    draconian regulations on businesses . Environmentalists allowed this    to occur because it brought massive    from liberal foundations , political power , and prestige . [ 2 ] Politicians realized they could win 2] Politicians by pandering to the environmental movement the environmental movement    claims , and 2] Politicians as protectors of nature and the public health . The wind , solar , and ethanol industries saw they could use regulations to The wind, solar, and ethanol industries competitors or help themselves to public subsidies . The wind, solar, and ethanol industries , EPA is a captive of activist and    groups . Its regulations have nothing to EPA with protecting the environment . Its rules account for nearly EPA of the $ 2 trillion annual cost of complying with all national regulations in the United States . In 2008 , The Heritage Foundation estimated the costs of EPA ’s first proposal to EPA greenhouse gases in the name of fighting global warming were " close to $ 7 trillion and three million manufacturing jobs lost . " According to Heritage , " the sweep of regulations    …      could severely affect nearly every major    product from cars to lawnmowers , and a million or more businesses and buildings of all types . And all of this sacrifice is in order to make , at best , a minuscule contribution to an overstated environmental threat . " President Barack Obama has routinely used EPA to circumvent Congress to impose severe regulations on farmers , ranchers , other private landowners , fisheries , and the energy sector . Just last week , the agency rushed through approval of new fuel efficiency standards for automobiles more than a year ahead of schedule to thwart any attempts by the Trump administration to stop it . Courts and Congress have objected to and Congress to limit EPA ’s abuses , but without noticeable success . Once a genuine success story , EPA has become the biggest EPA to further environmental progress . Replacing EPA , The solution is EPA return this authority to the states , replacing EPA with a Committee of EPA Whole of the 50 state environmental protection agencies . State EPAs already have primary responsibility for the implementation of the nation ’s environmental laws and EPA regulations . With more EPA 30 years of experience , these state agencies are ready the 50 state environmental protection agencies management of the nation ’s environment . Accountable to the nation’s state legislatures , state EPAs are more attuned to    needs and   . Located in 50 state capitols , they are less vulnerable to the Left the 50 state environmental protection agencies massive beltway lobbying machine . The Committee would be made up of representatives from each state . EPA could be phased out over five years , The Committee could include a    preparation period followed by a    program in which 25 percent of the agency ’s activities would be passed to the Committee each year .    percent of EPA The Committee could be eliminated and most of the The Committee pay for national research labs . A small administrative structure would allow the states to refine existing environmental laws in a manner more suitable to protecting our environment without thwarting the development of our natural resources and energy supplies . Benefits of Replacing EPA , The federal budget for environmental protection could be reduced from $ 8 . 6 billion to $ 2 billion or less . Staffing could be reduced from more than 15 , 000 to 300 . The real savings , of course , would be in reduction of the $ 1 trillion in annual regulatory costs EPA imposes each year . This reform would produce a second huge benefit by ending the government ’s war on affordable energy . EPA is the principal funder and advocate of global warming alarmism EPA the myth that    climate change is a crisis . That movement would end on the day EPA ’s doors shut , allowing Congress to return to taxpayers EPA a " peace dividend " amount to some of the $ 4 billion a day currently spent    on climate change . Dismantling EPA is one part of a comprehensive set of reforms , many EPA them discussed by Trump and referred to in the GOP platform , taxpayers and consumers lighten the massive weight of government regulations on the American people . The nation needs a      and    agenda that recognizes the tremendous value of the natural resources under our feet . While the rest of the world stumbles blindly in the grip of an    and    ideology , the U. S. can march ahead and regain its place as the world ’s economic and technological leader . The the U. S. ’s environment the world terrific shape , thanks to early efforts by EPA and more recent efforts by state governments and businesses . The nation ’s economy and environment will be even better if the federal The nation’s out of the way . EPA has long outlived its usefulness . Let ’s return its powers to the EPA , where they EPA .
