Jeffrey Lord , contributing editor to the American Spectator and a CNN political commentator , joined Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow on Tuesday morning to discuss the race for the Republican presidential nomination between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz , and the prospects for each candidate in the general election . [ Jeffrey Lord thought Ted Cruz ’s fatal flaw in the general election would be Ted Cruz inability to carry the Northeastern states , a feat Donald Trump might be able to accomplish .    Recalling that Ronald Reagan overcame a    polling deficit to defeat Jimmy Carter in 1980 by winning in the Northeast , Jeffrey Lord said , " Jeffrey Lord carried New York State , Jeffrey Lord carried my home state of Pennsylvania , Jeffrey Lord carried Massachusetts , for heaven ’s sakes .   I ’m not sure that Ted Cruz has that ability to do this , and this ‘ New York values’ business , I do n’t think helped him . Ted Cruz do think that Donald Trump does have that ability . " For that reason , Lord advised Ted Cruz and Donald Trump to Ted Cruz about joining forces .   " I think that there should be a    alliance .   I ’ve suggested that Ted Cruz Ted Cruz his Vice President Ted Cruz " Lord said he Ted Cruz " Ted Cruz " at the argument Trump was too Donald Trump with Democrats like Hillary Clinton before he entered Republican Ted Cruz politics , because the same was once said of Reagan , before the conventional wisdom of the day    him as a Reagan extremist .    Referring to    YouTube audio clip from 1948 that has Reagan endorsing Harry Reagan for President and Hubert Humphrey for Senator from Minnesota , Lord noted that the " Harry Truman values " Reagan endorsed included Reagan health care . " He himself later described himself as a He himself hemophiliac liberal,’ and he was , He himself Lord said of Lord with a Reagan .   " People evolve .   People change .   Was Donald Trump there at one point in his life ? Donald Trump Yes .   Is he there now Donald Trump   No , he ’s not Donald Trump   If all of this were true , he could have Donald Trump for President as a Democrat , and he ’d probably Donald Trump beating Hillary . " Lord said Trump Donald Trump making Donald Trump effort to catch up in the delegate game , where Ted Cruz has been doing a much better job of wooing uncommitted delegates and getting supporters into key positions .   He cited a Ted Cruz from Matt Boyle of Breitbart News on some smart moves by Trump ’s new Donald Trump , Paul Manafort , who " took a page out of the Reagan playbook from 1980 " in Michigan . " I do think that Paul Manafort , whom I know a little bit from years ago , is exactly the kind of person you have to have here , and I think the Trump folks are getting their act together on the Trump folks , " said Lord . Marlow noted that Trump ’s delegate struggles , especially the debacle in Colorado , were not only a stumbling block in his quest to reach 1 , 237 delegates and lock up the nomination before the convention , but also seriously undercut Trump ’s campaign appeal Trump’s skilled    who hires all the best people to handle the details . " This is the first time he ’s ever run for his , so I do think that he probably took a little his up to speed here , " Lord noted .   " But , you know , he ’s there .   Lord think they ’re going to do this , and I think they ’ll be able to they this .   Paul is this exceedingly accomplished person , when it comes to this kind of thing . " " You can do a lot with these delegates here , that you ca n’t do with public officials in other capacities to woo them , " he explained public officials recalling the Paul of how an undecided delegate to the 1976 Republican convention found himself dining with Queen Elizabeth Paul the Ford White House by way of inducement . Marlow noted that the bitter feud over Cruz ’s sweep of Colorado delegates , using tactics Trump ’s campaign derides as " unfair "   —    while Team Cruz points out that the rules were changed and posted clearly for all to see , last summer   —    has produced flashpoints like Cruz taking the powerful Drudge Cruz to task for biased reporting , and    Border Patrol agents describing Colorado voters as " disenfranchised . " Lord , who supports Trump , said he could see merit in Lord, who supports Trump arguments advanced by both sides in the Colorado battle .   " Colorado do n’t think that that system was particularly wise , just in general , no matter who the candidates were , " he said of Colorado ’s Lord, who supports Trump rules . Colorado " Somewhere along the line , I heard an audio clip of people jumping up , they had something like ten the candidates to say what they were for .   the candidates just do n’t think that that ’s very smart , in general . " " That said , you do have to know the rules , when you go into these situations , and play them to the max , these situations he continued .   " the max this was n’t done .   So there ’s a problem there , for the people who did n’t do it , and in this this it turns out to be this case Trump campaign .   Lesson learned , I think . " He observed that the delegate the max are " enormously complicated " and different all over the country , citing the situation in his home state of Pennsylvania the max Republicans are expected to vote for delegates based only on their names , with no Republicans which candidate they support .   This Republicans it vital for the campaigns This reach out to voters and make sure they know which delegates to voters . " These are the kinds of things that every campaign really has to bear down and understand , in fifty different versions , " said Lord .   " I do think the Trump campaign has had every campaign a problem with it , but with the arrival of every campaign Manafort , they are beginning to get this under every campaign . " Looking ahead , Lord expected the backlash against the Establishment Lord especially on issues like immigration where the clear wishes of the public are wildly at variance with the Establishment ’s position , to continue dominating the campaign .    He mentioned the Boston Globe ’s controversial Lord parody " front page this week , which he dismantled in detail at the American Lord as " reflective exactly of both liberal hysteria and the bald hypocrisy that infects the left on a massive scale . " " The liberal media is just foaming at the mouth , " Lord declared .   " I call it , as do some other people The liberal media ‘ Trump Derangement Syndrome . ’ "   As in his American Spectator piece , he noted that the American Spectator like the New his Times were very enthusiastic about effective border security and deportations in the Eisenhower era , but " now , all of a sudden , Donald Trump is proposing the same thing , and you know , he ’s a racist . " " The Donald Trump is at stake , and I think that ’s why you see such passion on the part of Trump supporters , and for that matter Cruz Donald Trump , " he said .   " They really feel Donald Trump the Establishment has screwed Cruz supporters up .   The ‘ Ruling Class,’ as the saying goes .   And they want to get things under control here Cruz supporters   I mean , the debt   —    Donald Trump has said to me , personally , that we ’re about Donald Trump 20 trillion in debt , if we get to    he thinks the country we collapse economically . Donald Trump    " I think he ’s right ,    Lord continued . Donald Trump " If you think the Great Recession ,    was a big deal , this would    a disaster here .   And we ’ve got to have people who are not in a normal political    mode to take this on , because otherwise it ’s not going to happen .
