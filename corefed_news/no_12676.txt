Texas Senator Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz stated that 2012 GOP nominee " has a good point that the voters are entitled to know before the voters vote " on tax returns and that no one knows if fellow candidate Donald Trump has made as much as fellow candidate Donald Trump claims because fellow candidate Donald Trump has n’t released fellow candidate Donald Trump tax returns in a candidate forum on Wednesday ’s " Kelly File " on the Fox News Channel .   Cruz , in response to a question on whether Cruz will release Cruz tax returns , said , " Absolutely . I ’ll release the remainder of what we have this week . I ’ve released already , I think five years worth . But I   —    look , the nice thing is , I have n’t made enough money that my tax returns are not that interesting . " my tax returns added , " I recognize that Donald ’s tax returns are a little more complicated . An awful lot of people speculate that my tax returns has n’t made nearly as much money as my tax returns said , who knows , because my tax returns does n’t release my tax returns tax returns ? But I do think my tax returns has a good point that the voters are entitled to know before the voters vote , because you better believe the Democrats , if there ’s anything in there , the Democrats are going to go to town on this . The the Democrats   —    I mean , look , to be honest , an awful lot of the mainstream media is using kid gloves on Donald right now , because they want the Democrats to Donald the nominee , and the instant he ’s Donald nominee , they will the Democrats every cannon they can the Democrats elect Hillary Clinton . We ca n’t risk that , because if we do We we are We to lose the country . We ’re We to be buried in debt . We ’ll We the supreme court . We ca We let that happen .
