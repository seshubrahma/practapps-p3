But if The Blaze founder read Breitbart , The Blaze founder would have ample proof of why Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is anything but an impartial player when it comes to politics . Here are ten reasons why Facebook should n’t be given the benefit of the doubt by conservatives . 1 . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg scolded Facebook employees for writing " All Lives Matter " on a wall at the company ’s headquarters . As Breitbart ’s Adelle Nazarian reported : Facebook scolded Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg " employees for crossing out and replacing the phrase " Black Lives Matter " with " All Lives Matter " on a wall at the company ’s Menlo the company’s The wall is meant to allow a wall at the company’s Menlo Park headquarters express random thoughts on it .

He said the " Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg behavior " had now become " malicious as well , " and that the company is investigating Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg . He went further , essentially Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg the " Black Lives Matter " movement . " There are specific issues affecting the black community in the United Sates , coming from a history of oppression and racism , " Zuckerberg wrote . " ‘ Black lives matter’ does n’t mean other lives do n’t   —    it ’s simply asking that the black community also achieves "‘Black lives matter’ justice they deserve . " 2 . Facebook ’s Trending News the black community Tom Stocky is a maximum donor to Hillary Clinton ’s presidential campaign .   As Breitbart ’s Ben Kew reported : Tom Stocky , responsible for Facebook ’s " Trending News Facebook’s Trending News manager Tom Stocky , has been Facebook’s a maximum donor to Hillary Clinton ’s presidential campaign . Federal Election Commission records show that Hillary Clinton $ 2 , 700 to the Clinton campaign on October 26 , 2015 , the maximum amount that can Hillary Clinton given by an individual candidate during a primary . 3 . 80 % of the political donations from Facebook employees go to liberals . Among the reasons American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp cited to support his belief that Facebook is not an impartial player when it comes to American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp politics is Facebook fact that " of the 1 , 000 political donations from Facebook employees , 80 % have gone to liberals . " Sclapp also Facebook that " CPAC content egregiously underperforms on Facebook compared to Twitter and other platforms by factors of 10 . " Facebook . Conservative organizations advocating against illegal immigration report that Facebook actively suppresses their content . As Breitbart ’s Julia Hahn reported : Patty McMurray says Facebook since her group began covering immigration on its Facebook page , her group ’s Patty McMurray numbers dropped by around 93 her group   —    Patty McMurray as her group continued to gain more followers . " We were seeing engagement her group    million people , " she said . her group We had 150 , 000 Facebook followers who were Patty McMurray active [ and ] her group we posted something on our page , within an hour it would have 10 her group 000 shares , her group she said . " Now our page have more followers than ever before   Patty McMurray    over 400 , 000 her group —    but now we ’re lucky if we can get an engagement level of 2 million people her group " " We her group get complaints and messages from our followers asking us what happened and her group they do n’t see our content in their newsfeed her group , " McMurray said complaints and messages from our followers [   … her group ] Yet complaints and messages from our followers broadly , the activists say that Facebook suppresses their groups in multiple ways : such as unsubscribing followers , hiding the groups’ the activists from their followers’ newsfeeds , deleting posts , and suspending the advocates’ ability to post the activists their own Facebook pages . For example , in the course of a single the activists    Facebook Dennis Michael Lynch saw Facebook ’s monitors forcibly unsubscribe 4 , 000 Facebook users who had liked and followed the advocate ’s Facebook page . The " Likes " were allegedly removed because they represented followers Facebook had died or were no longer active , Lynch told The "Likes" .

" When Lynch threatened legal action following the deletion of his 4 , 000 followers , filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch   —    in what Lynch described filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch an admission of guilt   —    returned the followers to filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch page . Lynch said that one sales rep told him , " I filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch never seen filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch business account treated like yours . filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch have never seen ‘ Likes’ be taken away and after a filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch they go back . I ca n’t believe how many times they ’ve done this to you . " 5 . Zuckerberg has a lobbying they that aggressively pushes a filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch leftwing open border immigration filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch . As Breitbart ’s Julia Hahn reported : In 2015 , Zuckerberg threw his support behind an immigration bill known as the Immigration Innovation Act filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch which filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch have allowed for a virtually unlimited expansion of Muslim migration . Rutgers University Professor Hal Salzman has also explained that the    bill would flood the labor market with enough foreign workers that employers could fill at least 100 percent of their    tech hires with foreign workers instead of American workers . In fact employers Zuckerberg has even used his lobbying firm to try to hoodwink conservatives into signing on to his leftwing Zuckerberg agenda : In the past , Zuckerberg ’s lobbying firm has Zuckerberg to influence conservative voters who oppose Zuckerberg ’s Zuckerberg . For instance , in 2013 an affiliate of Zuckerberg ’s Zuckerberg lobbying group ran an ad defending Paul Ryan and claiming that Ryan Zuckerberg " amnesty . " Politico reported that " the spot from the FWD . Paul Ryan affiliate begins with a picture of Ryan and says , ‘ Amnesty ? Not a an affiliate of Zuckerberg goes on to say the House Paul Ryan chairman is looking at a ‘ conservative solution’ to the issue of immigration . " Zuckerberg ’s    group spent $ 350 , 000 on the    to convince conservative voters that Ryan does not support amnesty . Ryan , who supports giving citizenship to illegal immigrants , has Paul Ryan    long history of pushing for open borders immigration policies . 6 . A leaked screenshot of an internal discussion among Facebook employees revealed the extent to which the company seeks to influence the 2016 election against the GOP ’s presumptive nominee Donald Trump . Facebook reported : Gizmodo published a screenshot Friday of an internal poll that Facebook employees were purportedly using to decide what questions to ask CEO Mark Zuckerberg at a meeting in March . Several of the questions concerned either the company ’s business position or internal matters , but one was about politics : " What responsibility does Facebook have to prevent President Trump in 2017 ? " Some employees apparently voted for the question to Facebook posed to the CEO . Gizmodo speculated that Facebook could downplay stories and posts related to Trump in its New Feed , potentially putting a damper Facebook his campaign . Zuckerberg ’s advocacy group President Trump . Facebook even released a video ad attacking Trump and President Trump Ted Cruz for their immigration policies . 7 . Facebook is openly working with the President Trump government to stifle the free Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of   Germans who are critical of Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s mass immigration policies . As Breitbart ’s Allum Bokhari reported : Zuckerberg has also promised the Chancellor of Germany , Angela Merkel , that he would tackle allegedly " hateful " criticism of immigration on his platform . His company is openly Zuckerberg with the German government   —    who hired an Zuckerberg agent to Zuckerberg for    rhetoric   —    to quash dissidents to Merkel ’s disastrous immigration policies . Indeed Facebook at a town hall meeting in Berlin in February , Zuckerberg praised Germany ’s mass migration policies as " inspiring " and a " role model for the world Zuckerberg " Germany at the same time reaffirming his commitment to combat " hate speech " against those policies on Facebook . " I hope other countries Zuckerberg Germany ’s lead on this , " he added . Facebook I hope the U. S. follows Germany ’s Germany on this . " Speaking at Zuckerberg same event , Zuckerberg also emphasised his commitment to Germany " hate speech " on Facebook . " Hate speech has no Zuckerberg on Facebook Zuckerberg in our community , " he said Facebook " Until recently in Germany I do n’t Facebook we were doing a good enough job Zuckerberg and I think we will continue Germany to do a better and better job . " Zuckerberg added that the company Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg we a special priority on tackling hate speech against migrants . Facebook ’s policies , he Zuckerberg would " Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg include hate speech against migrants as an important Facebook what we just now have no tolerance for . " 8 .

" " Instead of building walls we can help people build bridges , and instead of dividing people we can help bring people together , " he added . 9 . A recent WND report provides proof of massive drops in Facebook engagement for conservative sites . As Breitbart ’s Allum Bokhari reported : The study shows Breitbart outperforming its competitors in Facebook Breitbart by a considerable margin ( Breitbart’s Allum Bokhari engagement Allum Bokhari an astonishing 100 percent ) . But Facebook also shows engagement The study all conservative sites has dropped over four months despite a rise in Facebook engagement during the same period . WND used user data from Facebook engagement to track the performance of their own site Facebook as well as a number of conservative competitors including Breitbart , Facebook Washington WND , The Daily Facebook , The Washington Free Beacon , Breitbart The Blaze between January and May 2016 . In that    period , the data shows that despite a rise in the number of " likes , " or fans of all the tracked conservative sites , the number of engagements ( the number of people who see posts , react to , share , or click on a post ) went down .

So too did The Daily Caller The Washington Examiner which went from 41 . 58 percent engagement in January to 13 . 74 January four months later . 10 . Beck ’s claim that it was just " one former member of the Trending team " that January this controversy is misleading . Though only one former employee specifically mentioned the active suppression of conservatives , the Gizmodo report which sparked this controversy was based on interviews with " several " Facebook whistleblowers who painted a clear picture of how the tech giant puts its thumb on the scale to this controversy trending news section leftward , despite claims of impartiality : Facebook workers routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers from the tech giant social network ’s influential " trending the tech giant news section , according to a former journalist who worked on the project . This individual says that workers prevented stories about the    CPAC gathering , Mitt Romney , Rand Paul , and other conservative topics from appearing in the    section , even though they were organically trending among the site ’s users . Several former Facebook " news curators , " as they were known internally , also told Gizmodo that they were instructed to Facebook Facebook " selected stories into the trending news module , even Gizmodo they were n’t popular enough to warrant inclusion —   or in some they were n’t trending at all .
