" After meeting with Judge Gorsuch , conducting a thorough review of Judge Gorsuch record , and closely following Judge Gorsuch hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , I believe that Judge Gorsuch is a qualified jurist who will base Judge Gorsuch decisions on Judge Gorsuch understanding of the law and is    among Judge Gorsuch peers , " Donnelly said in the statement . Five more Democrats need to cast a yes vote to reach the 60 needed to break a potential filibuster attempt to confirm Gorsuch and 35 Democrats have said Gorsuch and 35 Democrats will vote no .
