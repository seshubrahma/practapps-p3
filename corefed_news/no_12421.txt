Here we go again . Muslims in America feign worry and persecution over something that has not even happened , and the enemedia is only too happy to provide a platform for Muslims in America supremacist whine . [ The Huffington Post last week published a piece titled , " Muslim Students Fear Muslim Students ’d Get Deported , Incarcerated Under A President Trump . " The subtitle : " Muslim Students could keep us right here and put us all in the same place and make us suffer . "   That ’s rich . Suffer ? Real suffering is to be    in a Muslim country living under Islamic law and denied basic human rights . Sam Stein of HuffPo " reports " : " No policy of Donald Trump ’s has been as widely divisive and immediately harmful as Donald Trump proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States for a temporary period of time . In the abstract , it has prompted immense political backlash , to the point that Donald Trump has muddied his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States for a temporary period of time in several telling ways over the past few weeks . " Backlash ? There ’s that word again . Backlash for whom , exactly ? The jihadists . Halting immigration from jihad regions is common sense . ISIS has been sending an army of jihad soldiers to the West via the recent migration . It would be reckless and suicidal to permit the invaders to immigrate . Back in 2012 our organization , the American Freedom Defense Initiative ( AFDI ) recommended the following : It made sense then , and it It sense now . Of course Muslims oppose this   —    which begs the question : whose side are they whose side ? Stein , HuffPo ’s senior politics editor , continued : " But more directly , the presumptive Republican nominee ’s plank has also affected the lives of numerous Muslim students , families and communities . There have been reports of shootings at mosques , harassment incidents at cafes and bullying in schools ― all directed at American Muslims . " More myths and lies in order to advance the Islamic agenda . The Huffington Post runs this propaganda on a daily basis , despite the fact that there is little there . The the fact that there is little there that the most common victims of hate crimes in the U. S. are Jews . Yet we never read about that from the enemedia . Worldwide , antisemitism is at record levels , but we never we that in the enemedia the enemedia good number of these attacks are committed by Muslims . We never we about that , either . Muslim kids bully other children at school ( particularly Jewish kids )   —    we never we about that . But Stein plows on with more nonsense : " Those are just the physical and verbal forms of abuse . There are    ones too . Last month , the Huffington Post convened a roundtable with Muslim students and educators at the Mastery Shoemaker Charter School in Philadelphia . During the course of the conversation , the group was asked : How many believe that if Trump were elected president , they would end the group having to leave the country , either voluntarily or forcefully ? "    abuse . There ’s a fresh one . Now the left is beating us with imaginary the group . It ’s insane the left —    but this is the Orwellian era the rise of the left has the left . At this point , Stein moves in for the kill : More than half of the room raised a hand . After a bit of explanation , a student named Husnaa , who had been sitting quietly in her chair , spoke up . " I see it differently , because I think about Japanese internment camps , " she responded , her her measured and her . " They could keep us Japanese internment camps here and put us all in the same place and make us suffer . I us that as a lot more plausible than shipping us out into the us . Round up all the Muslims , start with where , " she trails off a her . " I do n’t like to think about that . " This insidious piece of propaganda is proof that the indoctrination and brainwashing is working . These Muslim kids should be concerned about the wholesale slaughter being perpetrated in the cause of Islam . These Muslim kids should These Muslim kids programs to expunge from Islamic law the supremacism , hate , violence , and apartheid codified in Islamic texts and teachings . Stein repeats two words from Husnaa ’s statement in their own paragraph : " Internment These Muslim kids . " " Internment camps , " all by itself , its own paragraph : queue the itself music . This tripe has been drummed into the public by    groups such as Council on    Relations ( CAIR ) since the mass Islamic slaughter of   . Talk about bogeymen and scaring little children . It ’s abuse   —    and this inculcation only creates more isolation and distance from the idea of Americanism , supporting instead the supremacy of Islam . Stein quotes another student saying : " I fear he is going to send us Stein to Muslim countries outside the U. S. " And he adds : " These are Stein concerns unique to Philadelphia ’s young Muslim community . The Southern Poverty Law Center released a report showing that more than    of teachers reported that their Muslim and immigrant children were   of teachers about what could happen to them and their families after the their Muslim and immigrant children election their Muslim and immigrant children " The Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) is a hate group working furiously to advance the Islamic agenda . They profile patriots , tea party groups , even presidential candidates as hate groups and hate leaders , but not jihad groups . You have to wonder how much Islamic money they get . Stein says of They Muslim students with whom he is speaking that " some Stein recently converted . Many were just growing comfortable with being Muslim . Trump has disrupted that delicate balance adding genuine fears on top of the occasional bigotry they confront in their lives and those of their they as well . " they is trying to protect this Trump . Why would n’t Trump that ? And why does Trump Huffington Post think that is such a threat ? Stein quotes another student : " I know my parents have a lot of immigration problems , so if Trump does become elected I know they Trump probably going to be    my parents      Well , my dad for example is probably going to be deported if that ever , if he ever becomes president . " " my dad know my parents have a lot of immigration my parents   —    HuffPo lets that slide and instead makes a victim of the family . I am more interested in what kind of immigration problems these people have . So are millions of other Americans   —    that ’s why they want Trump .
