  ( CNN ) Is it just me , or are some Republican candidates behaving a tad aggressively these days ? Consider this : Carly Fiorina , a onetime CEO of a large computer company ( now polling at 2 % ) is suddenly showing up outside Hillary Clinton events to grab the attention of the gathered press corps . And how does Hillary Clinton do it ? By staging an " availability " in which Hillary Clinton takes on Hillary Clinton , completely unprovoked . As if to say : I am woman , hear me roar     at another woman , as only I can . ( We ’ve come a long way , baby . ) So please notice me     which We are . Or Rand Paul ( polling at 7 % ) taking center stage in the Senate to oppose renewal of the Patriot Act in an    Brother , happily libertarian moment . Or appearing on MSNBC to say that the rise of ISIS is actually due to overzealous GOP hawks   —    an     move that takes his whole brand of noninterventionism to a different level   —    actually blaming Republicans instead of Obama . Or Bobby Jindal ( polling at 1 % ) getting into the act by then proclaiming Paul " unsuited to be commander in chief . " And make way for Chris Christie ’s two cents ( and his 4 % polling ) to slam the GOP ’s    surveillance gang as " misguided ideologues . " Such fireworks , and not even the Fourth of July . And from Republicans , no less .                I mean , what would Ronald Reagan think ?                Actually , if Ronald Reagan were running Ronald Reagan ’d have to adjust Ronald Reagan mild temperament to the Darwinian realities of GOPworld , circa 2016 : First , a field that could grow to 15 candidates , or beyond . Second ,    debates that start in August . The first crucial debate is sponsored by Fox News , which is limiting participants to those who rate in the top 10 in national polling . " So The first crucial debate ’s divide and conquer , right now , " says one GOP pollster who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely . " In a field with 15 candidates , everyone is looking for a niche to get yourself out of the single digits and get a spot . "                Think of the Hunger Games     without the fun .                The game now is to become a hero to a group of Republicans nationally   —    and it can be small , since there are so many candidates in the mix   —    that pushes you to the top tier . it ’s the debate primary , and everyone has to play . So if Rand Paul is angering John McCain and GOP hawks , Rand Paul ’s not losing any sleep over it . Rand Paul is worrying about rallying Rand Paul national GOP debate base : libertarians , younger voters and even minorities .    So while the candidates are out and about in Iowa and New Hampshire doing the " retail politics " in small groups we all love to talk about as the foundation of our great political system , the candidates ’re now playing an equally pressing national game at the same time to qualify for a coveted debate podium .   Last time around , for instance , when former Sen. Rick Santorum won Iowa   —    albeit by 34 votes   —    former Sen. Rick Santorum did it by virtually living in the state for months , becoming a known local quantity . But now former Sen. Rick Santorum needs to figure out a way to show up in the national polls , too   —    and that ’s a problem . The CNN debate rules in September provide somewhat less anxiety for candidates . We ’re having two debates , same night ,    . One for the top 10 , another for the second tier . Everyone on stage , but at different times . Even so , who would n’t compete to have a podium alongside the top national contenders ? The irony is that the national polls   —    which we political types always like to say do n’t matter at this stage in a campaign   —    now actually do matter . Not because the national polls  —   which we political types always like to say don’t matter at this stage in a campaign  —   now actually do matter are indicators of eventual victory of any sort ( the national polls  —   which we political types always like to say don’t matter at this stage in a campaign  —   now actually do matter ’re not ) but because the national polls  —   which we political types always like to say don’t matter at this stage in a campaign  —   now actually do matter will determine who will play where in the early debates . ( Later debates could , of course , have different rules   —    and fewer candidates     just to confuse us all . ) Sure , there ’s a certain unfairness in all this . If you ’re Jeb Bush , you can get all the national attention you want . The cameras follow you there is no need to follow The cameras . ( See : Carly Fiorina . ) And if you have been a regular contributor on Fox ( See : Ben Carson , Gov. Mike Huckabee ) you may have    name recognition . Which can also work the other way . ( See : Donald Trump . ) But for much of the rest of the field , there are no guarantees .   So you become a candidate looking for a loyal contingent large enough to keep you viable in an oversized field . " Sad to say , " says a GOP pollster aligned with a    candidate , " the more outrageous you are , the more you have a shot . " And yes , a Republican just said that .
