On Friday ’s broadcast of " PBS NewsHour , " New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s statements over the last week are n’t errors , statements over the last week show an " incapacity for empathy " and " an incapacity to control Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump own attention , and to say things that are just inappropriate for a politician or inappropriate for a human being . "   David Brooks stated , " I do think statements over the last week ’re not missteps in a way , because statements over the last week ’re not errors . statements over the last week ’re Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump . I do think statements over the last week ’ve seen   —    statements over the last week have seen this all along from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump , two things , one , incapacity for empathy . So , a normal person looks at Mrs. Khan and sees a woman in deep pain , and has an instinctual response of respect and admiration for what Mrs. Khan ’s endured , and sympathy , and you respond in a certain way . And   —    but Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s shown an incapacity for that for a long time . And then the second thing is , just an incapacity to control Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump own attention , and to say things that are just inappropriate for a politician or inappropriate for a human being . And so you get these trains of thought that go on where a word sparks off a thought , that sparks off a thought , that sparks off a thought , and a thought gives the impression of someone really not in control of the impression of someone own attention span . And so , these are characterological . And I think that ’s what sent the shivers through the Republican Party , and the shivers ’s become the subject of the debate this week , not did he make a mistake , but is this , in a sense , who he is ?
