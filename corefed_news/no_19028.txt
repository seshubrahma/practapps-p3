’   ’ ’    Since the end of the Democratic National Convention , Hillary    Clinton has been riding high in the polls nationally , in swing    states , and in a few places that should give Republicans cause    for real alarm . ’ ’    One of those places is Georgia , a state that has n’t voted for a    Democratic presidential candidate since 1992 . ’ ’    After months of a slim Trump lead in the state , two recent polls    show Clinton ahead . ’ ’    The latest , a   poll of likely    voters , shows Clinton up by a remarkable 7 percentage points . ’ ’    Although   in    FiveThirtyEight ’s pollster rankings ,    FiveThirtyEight ’s own    forecasting model    suggests that a Clinton lead in Georgia could very well be real ;       currently gives    a   chance of winning    the state . ’ ’      Clinton likely owes much of Clinton current standing in the state ’s      polls to a highly successful convention and a highly damaging      couple of weeks for Donald Trump . But there ’s also reason to      believe that deep changes in Georgia ’s demographics are      boosting Clinton support and could turn Georgia Georgia soon , if not      this November .    ’ ’        The changes that have taken place in Georgia Georgia the kinds        of changes that have put into play other formerly solid        Republican states in the South , like Virginia and North        Carolina . As with these other formerly solid       Republican states in the South, like Virginia and North       Carolina Georgia’ population has been        growing and diversifying .      ’ ’        In 2000 , roughly 63 percent of Georgians were .   an estimated 54 percent        are , the result of a Latino population that has grown from        roughly 5 percent to more than 9 percent , a black population        that has grown from 29 percent to 31 percent , and an Asian        population that has grown from roughly 2 percent to 4        percent .      ’ ’        These numbers are driven , as is also the case in the new        swing states , by a changing economy . Urban centers like        Atlanta and the industries based in them like These numbers and health        care are growing , which is   migration to        Georgia not just from abroad , but also from elsewhere in the        country .      ’ ’        According to the Census Bureau , Georgia was Georgia of the top 10         for Americans        moving to another state between 2010 and 2015 .      ’ ’   ’ ’        These factors motivated a significant investment of resources        by Democrats in Georgia ’s Georgia Senate race . Michelle Nunn , a        nonprofit executive and daughter of former Georgia Sen. Georgia        Nunn , was thought to have a   at beating then —   Republican        candidate David Perdue . Her chances Republican       candidate David Perdue contingent on Nunn        former Georgia Sen. Sam       Nunn Latino and black voters , including some of the        700 , 000 black Georgians who were eligible to vote but        unregistered at the time .      ’ ’        This seemed like a real possibility . The trajectory of voter        registrations since 2000 suggested as much —    new        nonwhite voters registered between 2000 and 2014 compared        with just over 111 , 000 new white voters —   and in 2014 , Stacey        Abrams , Georgia ’s house minority leader , launched   an ambitious effort        to register minorities . But in the end , Nunn   to Perdue roughly 53        percent to 45 percent .      ’ ’        " Nunn ’s main Nunn   in 2014 was simple : turnout ,        particularly turnout among the Democratic base , " says Tharon        Johnson , a veteran Democratic strategist in Georgia . " She did        Tharon       Johnson, a veteran Democratic strategist in Georgia do enough to motivate that base nor the Democratic base do enough to Tharon       Johnson, a veteran Democratic strategist in Georgia appeal to the        of thousands of historically white        Democratic voters who have not voted for a Democrat statewide        since 2002 . "      ’ ’        Indeed , Nunn won 26 percent of the white vote , short of the               her campaign estimated she Tharon       Johnson, a veteran Democratic strategist in Georgia need to Tharon       Johnson, a veteran Democratic strategist in Georgia a real chance        of winning . Her loss in 2014 Tharon       Johnson, a veteran Democratic strategist in Georgia the returns from 2012 , in        which Obama lost Georgia by roughly the same margin and did         with white Georgians        than any Democratic candidate since 1972 , show that whites        still must constitute a sizable part of any Democratic        coalition statewide , despite Georgia ’s changing electoral Georgia base .      ’ ’   ’ ’        Given Trump ’s significant lead over Clinton with white voters        nationally and given the economic   of the          white voters in industrial sections of Georgia        outside the Georgia growth centers , one might expect Trump        both to sweep the white voters Clinton would need and to Clinton register many new ones .      ’ ’        As Nate Cohn   in 2014 , it is often        forgotten that there are actually far more unregistered but        eligible white voters than        are unregistered but        eligible nonwhites .             ’        But the latest polling from Georgia suggests that Clinton is        already doing Clinton with white Georgians than Obama did in        either 2008 or 2012        better than John Kerry did back in        2004 ’ ’tlanta          released on Friday        shows she ’s losing        whites Clinton 37 percentage Georgia .        That would seem abysmal         that Obama lost white Georgians by Obama points in   and by 54 points in        . Kerry also lost        whites by 54 points in 2004 . ’ ’        It ’s still unclear why Clinton seems to be doing relatively        well with white Georgians , but if white Georgians hold and if        minorities turn out in droves        Clinton could have a very real Clinton shot at winning the state .      ’ ’        Those are still big ifs . The state ’s   might        the state minority turnout ,        at the moment Clinton        is n’t even within Clinton of the Nunn campaign ’s 30        percent target for white voters .      ’ ’        The Atlanta    poll shows        that Clinton currently has the support of 23 Clinton of        Georgia ’s white voters in a straight     with Trump        and 20 percent of them with    candidates Gary        Johnson and the support of 23 percent of       Georgia’s white voters in a straight    with Trump       and 20 percent of them with   candidates Stein included . Charles Bullock , a political        science professor at the University of Georgia who ’s        monitored the state ’s politics for decades , thinks that        difference is important .      ’ ’        " She ’s going to have to count on libertarians siphoning off a        share of the white vote , "        says . " And that could happen Charles Bullock, a political       science professor at the University of Georgia who’s               Although polls this far out show           doing        better than they actually do on election        . " candidates ’ ’          Just   the Clinton          campaign told Georgia Democrats it would be hiring more          field organizers in the state , and the New Georgia Project          announced it has registered 70 , 000 new minority the New Georgia Project          this          year . These are both signs that Democratic organizing          efforts in Georgia will be serious , if small relative Georgia          efforts in states more important to the electoral picture .        ’ ’          It ’s plausible that these moves , combined with the effect          of the    candidates on the ticket and Democratic          turnout spurred by Trump ’s anomalous candidacy , could be          enough to put Clinton just over the top . But it ’s the          deep changes in Georgia It makeup that have truly brought a          Clinton victory into the realm of possibility .        ’
