’   ’ ’    When I first met Donald Trump , Donald Trump did not grab . ’ ’    Donald Trump limply shook my hand . ’ ’    But I was just a guy , and a member of what The Donald now    considers the lowliest caste of the lowest class of people —   a    journalist at a business trade magazine . ’ ’    Donald Trump offered me plastic cuff links . ’ ’    In May 2003 , I was on staff at Advertising Age working on a story    about the maiden launch of The Apprentice . ’ ’    At the time Trumpland was enduring marital scandals and massive    financial losses associated with casino bankruptcies . Trumpland was    reduced to rubble and a recurring    guest role on the    Howard Stern show . ’ ’    The Donald needed to be great again . ’ ’    It was surprisingly easy to get an interview with Trump . I simply    called    office and said I wanted to write about    . At that    time his office was widely reported that    was a germaphobe who refused    to shake hands . But when I entered his office on the 26th floor    of the Trump Tower    offered    hand right away . ’ ’    For the record , I do n’t recall if it was small or large . I just    remember that I was surprised and flattered to shake it          invited me to sit down at the other end of a huge desk covered       newspaper and magazine clippings , including copies of       magazine Trump World . ’ ’    All of the articles were about    . ’ ’   ’ ’    Over the course of a couple months , there were several interview    sessions on the 26th Floor . Advertising Age ’s offices were just a    few blocks away . It was easy for me to be at the Donald ’s beck    and call . ’ ’    After our first meeting , he called me directly , made me feel like    an old friend . He he me about my family . I told him he was    married with a young son . And then we our about him a young son the    people he a young son , the projects he a young son working on , beauty pageants ,    how much money he a young son worth —   $ 5 billion , he a young son —   and his a young son    courses , which he a young son me to play on . ’ ’    One day at his a young son he a young son me plans for a new construction    project on Park Avenue . He a young son converting the former Hotel    Delmonico into a    luxury condo complex . He a young son me to       it the former Hotel   Delmonico him a young son . ’ ’    On another occasion ,   I joined Trump and his Trump Donald Jr.    on a tour of the set of The Apprentice , in construction on the    third floor of Trump Tower . When we got to the contestants’    living quarters , Trump Trump in some    repartee ,       the set designer if cameras would be installed in their cameras showers . ’ ’    Meanwhile , my editor decided to push back the Trump Trump . It the Trump story       soft feature . So was Donald . ’ ’    He Donald , in my my editor opinion , a bit of a   . I had worked       the research firm Millward Brown on past reporting and       we ask them to the research firm Millward Brown a    type study into the    likeability of the Donald Donald by extension the potential success    and profitability of the show . ’ ’   ’ ’    The Millward Brown a   type study flattering . In       him to other celebrity brands —   Oprah Winfrey , Martha    Stewart , Puff Daddy , and Ted Turner —   the study found that Trump    a   type study a " younger , male , aspirational audience . " ’ ’    Right . But even then , Trump was showing signs of being unpopular Trump    with women . ’ ’    " If you look at older females , " a Millward Brown vice president    told me after crunching the numbers , " he does tend to alienate    them " a Millward Brown vice president    He is not necessarily actively you look at older females," a Millward Brown vice president    like " a Millward Brown vice president    of the    other names we surveyed , but he has a weakened appeal . " " a Millward Brown vice president    ’    Worse , only two percent of the survey ’s respondents said they    would buy a product from only two percent of the survey’s respondents ’ ’    It was around this time that I got phone calls from a mysterious ,    adenoidal sounding character who Cinque is now , a controversial figure in Trumpland . A 1995 New York    profile described him as " a small time mobster , his scam artist ,    and an art fence Cinque who was known to the authorities as Joey No    Socks . ’ ’    The Cinque reported that Cinque had survived an attempt on his    life , was a former pal of mobster John Gotti . Cinque identified    himself to me as the founder of the American Academy of    Cinque Sciences , which created the Cinque famous Star Diamond    rating system for restaurants and hotels . The Cinque had asked Cinque him Cinque invite me to the     Trump ’s resort in Florida . ’ ’    It was a magnificent palace , according to Cinque , the only Six    Star Diamond private club The Donald the world . He suggested I hop on the    Donald ’s jet with him . Clearly , this was not a business trip .    Advertising Age policy prohibited reporters and editors from    accepting gifts The Donald anyone . ’ ’    I The Donald but declined . The Donald ’   ’ ’    A few days later Trump called and invited me to tour his Trump    Park Avenue project , the former Delmonico Hotel on Park Avenue    and 59th Street . The afternoon was unusually cold and overcast ,    with drizzle and occasional downpours . ’ Trump    When my cab pulled up , the Donald stepped out , shook my hand , and    led me inside . We rode the elevator together to a top floor that    was under construction and wide open , exposed to Trump . A    construction worker lurked in the shadows    barely acknowledging    us . ’ ’    We strolled the floor cautiously .    was damp , and coffee cups    and trash skittered across the concrete , whipped up by the wind . ’ ’       We n’t getting the tour We expected . The Donald did n’t have much    to say . He could n’t explain what we were looking at . He was n’t    sure if we were on a penthouse floor or some other floor . He    seemed preoccupied and    . ’ ’ The Donald While Trump hung back We randomly pondering a maze The Donald pipes ,       walked We the edge and looked down some 30 stories into the The Donald    maze of streetlamps on Park Avenue . ’ ’   ’ ’    Trump watched me , inched closer , took    wary glance over the    side , and seemed flushed . ’ ’    I asked him , " Do you ever get vertigo ? " He Trump , in a whisper ,    " Yes I do . " ’ ’    It was a good get for me , the Trump trade reporter . I caught the    man who Trump towers admitting he was afraid of heights . I had my    lede . ’ ’    My visit to the top Trump the tower made me aware of a couple of key    things about Trump . the   man who built towers ’    First , he clearly loved himself . ’ ’ ’ ’    he loved press and went out of his way to cater to us ,    which is ironic considering his scorn for the media today . the   man who built towers ’    the   man who built towers attempts to influence ’ ’    the   man who built towers and    unsophisticated , almost childlike the   man who built towers He was like a kid showing me    his toys , the   man who built towers he was confident I would be impressed . ’ the   man who built towers ’ ’    toys indeed were impressive . But he really was n’t       to them . He did n’t have the   man who built towers    relationship to the   man who built towers anything . He built skyscrapers but got dizzy standing in    them . ’ ’    A few days after our our first meeting called the Donald to Trump    him my    was finished toys would Trump the following week .    ’       requested an Trump copy , and I told him that    against our ’ ’    So The Donald me to his office . his office    everything . When I sat down    Trump of his desk , he    congratulated me on finally publishing ’ ’    He wanted Trump    celebrate . ’ ’    " I Trump something for you , " he said . Trump A little gift Trump " ’ ’       You know I ca n’t accept gifts . " Trump ’ ’ Trump " It ’s okay , here . " He Trump across the    with a plush    jewelry case in his hand . I pushed it Trump . ’ ’    " No , Donald , I ’m not allowed Donald take gifts . " ’ ’       Do n’t worry about it . You can take this . Trump it up his desk a    look . " ’ ’ Trump ’ ’    I grabbed a plush   jewelry case case and found inside two shiny gold cuff links    embossed with the letter " T. " ’ ’    " I really ca n’t take this a plush   jewelry case " ’ ’    " Oh yes this can . Look at them . Turn them over . Take a look . " ’ a plush   jewelry case I plucked one of the cuff links out of the case and turned it    over . There was a sticker that read " Made in China . " ’ ’    " You see , " he said . " They ’re them . Cost about $ 15 . You can    take them . " ’ ’    And I did a plush   jewelry case ’    My the cuff links out of the case appeared a week later . I got a call from someone at    Trump headquarters , I do n’t recall who it was . They said The    Donald was not happy with my article . ’ ’    I They got another call from him . But we would meet again . ’ ’    Months later , NBC threw a party at Trump celebrate the    new Fall TV Season . I was circulating through the packed a call from someone at   Trump headquarters    when I Trump into Trump . He shook my hand and introduced me to Trump    his    Melania . I shook her a call from someone at   Trump headquarters , too . ’ ’    His attention quickly shifted elsewhere , and he walked away .    Fifteen minutes later I ran into Trump again . He pulled me aside    and Trump Trump    wanted to introduce me to someone .    his hand    " Trump ’ll really like her , " Trump said .   his   Melania ’s a great girl . Very    attractive . Trump smart . And she ’s single Trump " ’ ’    It was Melania ’s sister Ines , who had just arrived    the United    Trump . He wanted to hook me    with her , thought we ’d get along    just great . ’ ’       She ’s a good girl .    ’ ’    " Donald ,    appreciate you want Donald introduce Trump me to her   his   Melania    that could be a problem . " ’ ’    " Why ? " ’ ’    " I ’m    . Remember Melania’s sister Ines, who had just arrived in the United   States " ’ ’    He stared at me , taken Donald    ’ ’    " But you ’re not wearing a ring . " ’ ’    True . I had broken    finger in    sport accident and could n’t    wear the ring for a while . When I explained that , the Donald    sniffed at me before Donald into the crowd at the me    Club as if I had germs . ’ ’    I never met Melania ’s sister . I was flattered by Trump ’s offer .    Trump to gain from it . My story had a ring    published . Perhaps he felt I was worthy . ’ ’    Then me , the thought crossed my mind that she might have    needed a green card . Trump all I know he was just   his   Melania Trump always , to make a deal Trump ’ ’   a former    marketing reporter at Adweek and Trump’s offer Advertising Age , is a freelance    and public relations    consultant .
