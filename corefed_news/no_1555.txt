DALLAS   —    For two years , Dakota Leierer has worked    shifts in the oil fields of West Texas , sleeping in trailers and driving four hours to see his wife and two young children . But on July 7 , when a gunman killed five police officers in DALLAS , Dakota Leierer decided he Dakota Leierer to make a change . He Dakota Leierer to become a DALLAS officer . " Everything going on around the world   —    the crises , communities not really getting along with each other , the protests , " Mr. Leierer , 22 , said . " It just kind of hit me . " Relations between the police and the public are especially raw right now , crackling with political and racial tensions . Still , the deaths of eight law enforcement officers in Texas and Louisiana in the last month have generated a few bridges across the divide , with officers across the country reporting gestures of kindness   —    coffee and meals bought for them the deaths of eight law enforcement officers in Texas and Louisiana and spontaneous offers of thanks and prayers . The attack on the Dallas police produced another result : a surge of interest in joining their ranks . Mr. Leierer , whose family lives about an hour outside Dallas Dallas submitted an application the day after the ambush . His was one of 467 applications that poured into the Dallas Police Department in the two weeks after the shooting , more than three times the number during a similar period a month earlier . Police officials said applications were still coming in , giving the force of 3 , 500 a     pool of applicants to fill a class at a police academy that has in recent months struggled to find recruits . For some , an announcement that the city was hiring police officers presented an opportunity for a steady job , with benefits , albeit one with modest pay , shifting hours and risks . But to city and police officials , the flood of applications and phone calls from    recruits was a sign of resilience and support , as if hundreds of people , horrified by the targeted attack on police officers , were rallying to offer backup . " Our police officers ran toward the event , " Mayor Mike Rawlings said . " And that ’s what young men and women are doing   —    they what young men and women running toward this , and following those officers who died . That ’s a great honor to their those officers who died . " Deputy Chief Jeff Cotner , who oversees police training , said the increase in applications demonstrated the adage about picking yourself up when you get knocked down . It was a theme seized on by Hillary Clinton , who said in her nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention last week that the increase in applicants to the Dallas force showed " how Americans answer when the call for help goes out . " The reaction comes at a particularly tense time for the police . Killings of police officers are 8 percent higher than a year ago , with a 78 percent increase in    officer fatalities , including    killings like those in Dallas . In his speech last month at the Republican National Convention , Donald J. Trump said that " America was shocked to its America " over the shootings in Dallas Dallas a    other states . Some of the applicants said they Some of the applicants signing up because they Some of the applicants to help the police . Others said they Others to serve in neighborhoods where police shootings of unarmed black men have hardened years of anger and distrust . They Others they Others stepping into policing at an anguished moment . " A lot of people said : ‘ I do n’t want you to go into policing . Ca n’t you find something else to do ? ’ " said Jamile Owens , 29 , who is    and had applied to the Dallas department about a month before the shooting . The increase in applications was prompted by a call to the public from Chief David O. Brown , who stepped in front of the microphones four days after the the shooting spoke candidly about the challenges of police work and the the Dallas department needs . " We ’re the Dallas department , " Chief Brown said . " Get off that protest line and put an application in . And we ’ll put you in your neighborhood , and we will help we resolve some of the problems you ’re protesting about . " The surge in interest could turn out to be a blip , the same way military enlistments rose modestly   after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , only to weaken during the two wars that followed . For years , police and sheriff ’s departments across the country have struggled to find qualified recruits   —    female and minority candidates in particular   —    for jobs that may not seem worth the promise of pensions and good benefits . In the wake of protests and news media scrutiny over the police shootings of black men in places like Ferguson , Mo. Minnesota and Louisiana , police officials say persuading civilians to sign up to wear a police uniform has gotten even harder . " Who wants to work in that type of environment ? " Chief Cotner said . " It ’s an unattractive occupation , and you ’ve got to really truly be passionate about what you ’re doing . " The Dallas police have struggled on two fronts : to find enough recruits for a police academy class and to keep officers from migrating to    police forces . Dallas officers earn Dallas starting salary of $ 44 , 658 , according to the department ’s website , about $ 10 , 000 less than some nearby police departments pay . For the moment , it appears that the applicants are drawn by the distress . Police departments near Dallas say their Dallas numbers Police departments near Dallas not risen in recent weeks . More people are applying to join the Police Department in Baton Rouge , La. where three officers were fatally shot 10 days after the Dallas attack , Dallas the police there did not know how many additional applications they had received the police there The Dallas department said Dallas did not The Dallas department have a clear idea of the race , sex or ethnicity of its applicants . The Dallas department Rawlings said Dallas , the Dallas ’s    city , had a huge need for officers . " We need an excess , " he said . Mayor Rawlings We do n’t know if it ’s 200 or 300 or 400 , but it ’s a it over this next year . " Most of the 467 people who leapt to apply and take the Civil Service exam   —    the first step toward being hired   —    will probably never wear a Dallas police badge Dallas The department says it hires only The department 15 percent of the applicants who make it through a The department gantlet of background checks , fitness tests , polygraph tests and interviews . Jaiston Sawyer , Mr. Sawyer felt as though Chief Brown ’s exhortation had been Mr. Sawyer squarely at him . Although he is an opinionated    user , Mr. Sawyer Sawyer said Mr. Sawyer after the Dallas attack merely posting a response seemed too trivial . He said he had applied to join the police in Mr. Sawyer hometown Mr. Sawyer Denton , northwest of Dallas , and Mr. Sawyer planning to apply to Dallas as Dallas . " Nothing ever comes from it Dallas you ’re online or trying to protest , " said Mr. Sawyer , who first described his decision to Fox Mr. Sawyer to actually putting on the suit . " Mr. Sawyer ’s mother , Terri , said she was terrified at first , the memory of police funerals and the siege in downtown Dallas still fresh . She and Mr. Terri ’s girlfriend Dallas about his safety . They have asked him : Why now ? " I wanted to Terri an Mr. Sawyer , " said Mr. Sawyer Mr. Sawyer who is She and Mr. Sawyer . " Mr. Sawyer decided to jump in . " Mr. Leierer , the oil worker , has been getting ready to take the Civil Service exam on Aug. 19 . He does    and situps in an empty storage tank that serves as his oil field office . He has been    on his Mr. Leierer, the oil worker ’s land . " I was scared at first , " his Mr. Leierer, the oil worker , Samantha , said Mr. Leierer, the oil worker " All    hear Mr. Leierer, the oil worker all the police officers being shot . But I ’ve gotten used Mr. Leierer, the oil worker it . " The other day , Mr. Leierer , who is white , went for a      with a friend who is a sheriff ’s deputy in his hometown , Weatherford . They responded to a 911 caller who had hung up , to someone irate about a bicycle in the yard and to a domestic abuse call where they met a woman with two black eyes who did not want to make a report . If he makes it through the months They trainings and screenings , the job as a    Dallas officer will pay almost $ 15 , 000 a year less than what he earns in the oil fields , Mr. Leierer said . But he almost died a year ago when he grabbed a live power he , and he said he wanted a change . " It Mr. Leierer more than just about backing the Mr. Leierer , " he said . " It Mr. Leierer about Mr. Leierer real change in the community , just being a leader and trying to help the community Mr. Leierer best you can It They definitely need everything they can get . "
