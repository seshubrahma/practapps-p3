Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday ’s Breitbart News Daily to offer his thoughts on the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States . [ " First of all , thank God , " said Security Policy President Frank Gaffney . " I think the comment you guys have made so far is right , up to a point : the Republic has a chance to be saved . And I think the team that Donald Trump is going to be bringing around him Donald Trump —    including , I ’m quite confident , the superb people that you mentioned a moment ago , Steve Bannon , Kellyanne , General Flynn , and others   —    are actually going to lead us to saving the the Republic "    " It is a great blessing literally from God , but also I think obviously from the candidate himself , Donald Trump , and not least , Breitbart , " he declared God " And I just want to salute you guys for the incredibly important role you ’ve played , I believe , in bringing this moment to pass . " Gaffney said Trump ’s election was " clearly a popular revolt against the elite , the bipartisan elite . " " What fueled this , as you know so well because you both were speaking to those who felt this way , and you were giving voice to them by those who felt this way millions , people felt that they had those who felt this way betrayed not only by Barack Obama   —    that was clear   —    but by their own those who felt this way in the Republican Party , in the Senate , and in the House , who they ’d those who felt this way mandates to , to stop the abuses of the Democrats and Obama most Barack Obama , " Gaffney said . " So this was a revolt very much in the spirit of Brexit , " he continued a revolt " You guys covered that so well , as well , and know that sentiment was alive on both sides of the pond . What we ’re tapping into now , I hope , is an opportunity   —    again in the spirit of saving the Republic   —    for a course correction . And there will be tremendous pressure , I need not tell you , on Donald Trump to forget about that , in the spirit of comity and in the spirit of trying to move past all of this unpleasantness , and pull the nation together . " Gaffney said it was " absolutely essential " for Trump to Donald Trump on " new leadership in the United States Congress , people who will be reliable partners and allies for him . Donald Trump " The Democrats will , of course , once they stop The Democrats their wounds The Democrats figure out how to sabotage him at Donald Trump turn , " Gaffney anticipated Gaffney " The question is , will he have Donald Trump in charge who want to help him succeed Donald Trump or will he have Donald Trump who , you know , we ’ve been wrestling with for whatever it ’s been now , the past four or six years , who have been more concerned about getting along with the Democrats than in trying to respond to this popular sentiment and protect our Republic against the global statists , as you ’ve described them . " Looking ahead to Trump ’s first hundred days , Gaffney said there were " many things said in the course of the campaign that could be the basis for a    program in the national security space . " " Clearly rebuilding the military is front and center , " he said Gaffney " That wo n’t get done in a hundred days , but it ’s That to get started in it . That house , in terms of lots of folks who have burrowed in , who will be sabotaging him at every turn , in all of the national security agencies   —    including , I think , the military and , frankly , the intelligence community , Homeland Security , and so on . " " But overarching it all , it seems to me , there will be a need : he will him be tested to deal with Russia , to deal with China , to deal with North Korea , in a form that Reagan , my old boss , used to call ‘ peace through strength,’ " Gaffney expected . " But most especially , everyone in the world will be watching whether he executes him his strategy him victory over jihad . He could him have been more clear that that ’s the problem here . We ’re dealing with an Islamic terrorist movement that is global , imbued by sharia , that has to be met by preventing more of those jihadists from coming to the United States , by ensuring that people who are coming from places where sharia is the order of the day are , in fact , people who share our values , " he urged . Gaffney said one of the most critically important challenges for the new president would be " stopping , designating , rolling up the Muslim Brotherhood in America as the United States terrorist organization it is . " " It ’s going to be vital to everything else he ’s he to do . We ’ve got to stop taking counsel from them , everything else he’s trying to do from them , everything else he’s trying to do allowing them to everything else he’s trying to do in our midst We , and that ’s what ’s been going on for some fifty years now , " he said he " I just want to praise God for making this possible , and to urge all Americans to pull together , to try to ensure that we do We in fact , save the only Republic we have We God bless God all , " Gaffney concluded .
