  ( CNN ) The Republican Party gathered in Cleveland   on Tuesday for the second night of The Republican Party convention , and CNN ’s Reality Check Team put the speakers’ statements and assertions to the test . The team of reporters , researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the speeches and selected key statements , rating the speeches true mostly true true , but misleading false or it ’s complicated . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , Reality Check : Christie on Clinton and China , By Tami Luhby , CNNMoney , Christie on attacked Clinton on multiple points , including the accusation that Clinton wanted the Chinese to purchase U. S. debt to help the Obama administration . " In China China Hillary Clinton the Chinese China our debt to finance China Obama ’s bloated Obama , " he said Clinton In February 2009 , soon after being named secretary of state , Clinton traveled Clinton China and urged Beijing China keep buying U. S. debt , according to media reports at the time . In an interview on Chinese television quoted by Reuters , Clinton said Clinton China made a " China " choice by buying United States debt instruments . Based on these reports , we rate Christie ’s statement as true . Reality Check : Christie on Clinton and Clinton back our girls’ By Ryan Browne , CNN , Christie also hammered Clinton with Christie series of charges about her failures Clinton serving as secretary of state . He was particularly critical over Christie ’s Clinton the Boko Haram terrorist group in Nigeria . " In Nigeria , Hillary Clinton amazingly Clinton Nigeria years to keep an al Qaeda affiliate off the terrorist watch list , " Christie said . Boko Haram , an affiliate of al Qaeda , was never designated a foreign terrorist organization during Clinton ’s leadership of Clinton Department . The department eventually labeled the group a terrorist the State Department under Kerry the Boko Haram terrorist group in Nigeria 2013 . According to a report obtained by Reuters ,    Department official Lisa Monaco had lobbied Clinton ’s State the State Department Clinton group a terrorist organization in 2012 . the State Department Beast also reported on the State Department ’s hesitancy during Clinton ’s tenure to designate the Clinton the State Department that a group of bipartisan members of Congress had also the group a terrorist organization department to put the group on the list , with some members saying that the designation would allow U. S. law the group a terrorist organization to work more closely with governments in the region . The kidnapping of the 200 Nigerian school girls occurred in April 2014 . While Clinton was head of the State Department at the time , Christie says she " fought " to keep them off the list and there is no evidence that she herself was Clinton responsible for the delay in The kidnapping of the 200 Nigerian school girls designation . Our verdict : false . Christie went Clinton to add : " Because of this reckless action by the candidate who is the    Christie of women all around the world . These al Qaeda terrorists abducted hundreds of innocent young women two years ago . These school girls are still missing today . And what was the solution from the    team ? A hashtag campaign . " While Clinton did tweet out the hashtag " bring back our girls " in the wake of the kidnapping , she was no longer in office when the kidnapping These school girls It ’s impossible to know whether a U. S. Clinton designation would have made any difference the kidnapping girls’ kidnapping . President Barack Obama did authorize the deployment of 80 U. S. troops to neighboring Chad about a the kidnapping event in an effort to aid in their search . Therefore we rate the claim that the " solution from the    team " was a " hashtag campaign " as false . Reality Check : Christie calls Clinton ’chief engineer’ of Gadhafi ’s overthrow , By Eve Bower , CNN , Christie assumed the role of prosecutor on the RNC stage , arguing that Clinton ’s policy in Libya made her " guilty " Christie " ruining Libya " and " creating a nest for terrorist activity Clinton . " He labeled her Clinton " chief engineer " of the Libya of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi , saying Clinton ’s " grand strategy Christie in Libya Clinton to blame for the North African state ’s current calamity . In early 2011 , Clinton protests spread like wildfire from Tunisia Libya Egypt and then Libya , the world watched for weeks as Libyan security forces used increasingly brutal methods to suppress the uprisings . By    there seemed Libya be a coalition of European powers emerging Libyan support of implementing a    zone over Libya . The approach would decisively change the course of events in Libya , and    President Nicolas Sarkozy seemed eager to take the Libya . In the U. S. Obama had been elected , in Libya , on    basis of his opposition to the U. S. war in Iraq , and he was deeply reluctant to engage in    overseas military conflict . But the U. S. Obama saw himself in a different situation altogether : having campaigned the U. S. Obama his desire to enhance France ’s position in the Arab world , President Nicolas Sarkozy promised President Nicolas Sarkozy " would be side by side with the oppressed President Nicolas Sarkozy " When the uprising in Libya began , Sarkozy saw an President Nicolas Sarkozy to France his mark . Though Clinton would ultimately be described as one of the most hawkish voices on Libya President Nicolas Sarkozy the Obama administration , senior President Nicolas Sarkozy S.   officials say that Clinton was initially skeptical of U. S. involvement in this international Libya . Obama at first tried a less interventionist approach , signing an Clinton order freezing Gadhafi ’s assets , and then backing a UN Security Obama resolution to impose sanctions . Days later , France and Britain pushed the UN Security Council for a quick resolution that would authorize a    zone , but Clinton , still reluctant , chose instead to work with Susan Rice , the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations , to buy time in which to build broader international support for the move . But by    as intelligence warned of an imminent humanitarian crisis if government forces took on    Benghazi , aides say Clinton shifted and became convinced that an immediate    zone was necessary . The Security Council resolution passed March 17 . Yet even after Clinton was decided that a coalition of NATO members would enforce the resolution , France remained eager to take the lead . On March The Security Council resolution , hours before the air campaign ’s official start , The Security Council resolution attacked Libyan government tanks on their way to Benghazi . Where the Obama administration had been reluctant to be seen as jumping into another war , Republicans at the time Libyan government tanks the administration ’s own words against it , describing the U. S. role , with some sarcasm , as " leading from behind . " In the first weeks after Gadhafi the administration’s fall , when Libya ’s    future seemed more hopeful , sources in the administration were eager to credit Secretary Clinton for her work helping to build an international coalition     and Clinton was happy to take it the Obama administration Our response , " Clinton has said , Secretary Clinton " smart power at its best . " But Secretary Clinton Clinton was neither the first to call for military intervention , Secretary Clinton the only one to plan the administration ’s smart power of the aftermath , we Secretary Clinton Christie ’s claim false . Donald Trump Jr. Reality Check : Donald Trump Jr. on his the Obama administration funding , By Juana Summers and Sonam Vashi , CNN , Donald Trump Jr. said his father would be " a President not beholden Donald Trump Jr. special interests , foreign and domestic and one who funded his entire primary run Donald Trump Jr. own pocket just his father’s it . " It ’s a claim we ’ve heard again and again . Although Trump has sunk a a President amount of his own money a President his campaign , CNN has found that he it about $ 14 CNN in campaign contributions from 8 , 200 individual donors through the end of April Trump Trump has loaned Trump campaign 76 % of the the Trump 57 . 7 million that the campaign has received through the end of April , according to the Federal Election Trump . While his campaign funded a vast majority of his campaign , he ’s also taken his campaign outside donors     not the end of April of his April pocket . His son Trump claim is false . Reality Check Trump Donald his campaign on Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare , By Amy Gallagher , CNN , The younger Donald Trump father ’s CNN Trump those of Clinton ’s .   Donald Trump Jr. Clinton to elect a President . .. who will repeal and replace Obamacare without leaving our most vulnerable citizens without health care , " Trump Jr. said , " and who will do it without destroying Medicare for seniors those of Clinton Hillary Clinton has proposed . " But Clinton really propose to end Medicare ? Earlier Clinton Donald Trump Jr. Clinton tweaked her previous stance on health care Clinton a Clinton to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders . Obamacare most recent Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare proposes expanding Medicare as Clinton option to adults as young as 50 . This expansion is Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare some conservative pundits have suggested that Clinton could destroy Medicare , since it invites Clinton people into an already overloaded system .   " Medicare is stretched so Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare to meet the needs of today ’s seniors that expanding enrollment is like inviting the neighborhood for dinner when you do n’t have Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare to feed Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare own kids , " wrote Fox News commentator Betsy McCaughey in Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare online news outlet Newsmax .                So is expanding Medicare likely to destroy it ? Medicare does have serious solvency problems , and is currently set to run out of funds by 2028 . Therefore , it would seem likely that any expansion of the program would exacerbate those problems and shorten Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare life of the Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare . Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare , as a historically popular program , it is unlikely that Medicare will be allowed to go bankrupt .   Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare being criticized by the likes of former President Ronald Reagan , the program has continued to expand since the program     under both Democrats and Republicans . In fact , even several    Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare have expanded it     including Reagan , former President Richard Nixon and George W. Bush .   It seems likely that the program president , whoever it may be the program would look for ways to shore up Medicare , rather than let it die .   Therefore    we rate former President Ronald Reagan Trump Jr. ’s claim that Clinton has proposed destroying Medicare false , however Clinton read the phrase     Clinton has not proposed to destroy Medicare , Clinton to Donald Trump Jr. Reality Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare expansion might strain the Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare , it is unlikely the system would be allowed to collapse . Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare Check : Carson on Saul Alinsky , Lucifer and Clinton role model , By Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare Block , Clinton , Carson claimed the phrase    Clinton has not proposed to destroy Medicare one of Clinton ’s " mentors was Saul Alinsky . Clinton someone the system greatly admired and that affected all of Clinton philosophies subsequently . " He also said Clinton wrote her college thesis on CNN ’s Clinton , Clinton that the dedication page for Alinsky Carson book , entitled , " Rules for Radicals , Saul Alinsky Lucifer . Alinksy was a community activist , regarded as a radical in the    century for Carson teachings about people ’s empowerment . Clinton did write Saul Alinsky thesis on Alinsky Clinton life , Clinton and political Saul Alinsky though much of her thesis was analytical . The conclusion of Clinton Lucifer reads : " In the first chapter it was pointed out that Alinsky is regarded by Alinksy as the proponent of a dangerous    philosophy . As such , he Saul Alinsky feared     just as Eugene Debs or Walt Whitman or Martin her college thesis has been feared , because each embraced her college thesis radical of political faiths     democracy . " This comparison to Saul Alinsky , Whitman and King , along with Clinton ’s continued exchange of letters with Alinsky Clinton into her law school years , suggests that Clinton Clinton a deep respect for Alinsky . Clinton Alinsky personally acknowledged Lucifer in his book , published in 1971 . He wrote , " Lest we forget at least Eugene Debs     acknowledgment to the very first radical : from all our legends Saul Alinsky mythology and history ( and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history Saul Alinsky     or which Saul Alinsky which ) Lucifer first Saul Alinsky known to man who rebelled against Saul Alinsky establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom . " Additionally , a Washington Post we written in 2007 suggests Alinsky had great influence over Clinton ’s political ideology , causing her to Clinton from a Republican to a Clinton . The article reads , " Arriving at Wellesley , she Clinton of the establishment Young Saul Alinsky , Clinton she Saul Alinsky drifted left . She said that Clinton , the year she Clinton Alinsky in Saul Alinsky , was a Clinton in her ’personal and political evolution,’ marked by the Clinton of the Vietnam War and the killings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy . " The paper also noted , however , that Clinton the U. S. war 2003 memoir , " Clinton History , Clinton that Clinton and Alinsky had a " fundamental disagreement Clinton about how to change the system .   Because of this , it is a stretch for Carson to say that Alinsky affected " all of her philosophies subsequently . " Verdict : Mostly true . RNC    Sharon Day , Reality Check : Day on Clinton Foundation money , Saul Alinsky Sonam Vashi , CNN , " As head of a foundation , you accepted tens of millions of dollars Carson this countries who enslave women and who Saul Alinsky Carson as    citizens , " Day said , referring to Clinton . The Clinton Foundation has CNN millions Clinton foreign governments , according to its website , which lists cumulative amounts . Saudi Arabia , Australia and Norway each gave the Foundation between $ 10 million and $ 25 million the Netherlands and Kuwait gave between $ 5 women and $ 10 million and Qatar , Brunei , Oman and the Clinton Foundation gave between $ 1 million and $ 5 million . Given Clinton Foundation slavery is illegal in all countries but    slavery exists in many countries to varying Clinton Foundation we ’re going to look at the women ’s Saudi Arabia, Australia and Norway each top donor countries instead . ( Note : for these indices , a rank with a smaller number generally denotes better treatment of women in that country . ) According to 2014 data from the United Nations’ Gender Inequality Index , Qatar ranks 116th out of 155 countries for gender inequality . Kuwait ( 79th ) Saudi Arabia ( 56th ) Oman ( 53rd many countries Arab Emirates ( 47th ) all rank in a    range , while the Netherlands ( 7th ) Norway ( 9th ) Oman ( 19th ) all ranking in a    range , treat women more equally Qatar For context , the United States is ranked 55th in Kuwait index . ( Brunei was not included in the overall ranking for this index ) . To compare with another index : The World Economic Forum ’s 2015 Global Gender Gap Report shows Norway Oman ranks poorly ( Australia out of 145 countries ) as does Saudi Arabia ( 134th ) Qatar ( 122nd ) the United Arab Emirates ( 119th ) and Kuwait ( 117th ) . the United Nations’ Gender Inequality Index ranked 88th , Australia was ranked 36th , and Norway and the the United Nations’ Gender Inequality Index both in the top 15 . The United States was ranked 28th . Given that at Oman some of the countries who donated millions to the Clinton Foundation have poor records in regards to women ’s rights , we rate Day ’s claim as true . NRA official Chris Brunei , Reality Check : Australia and the Second Amendment , Norway Chip Clinton , CNN , Gun rights the Netherlands focus Tuesday night in a speech by Cox the United States director of the National Rifle Association Clinton Foundation Legislative Action . He targeted Clinton ’s stance on guns and Clinton Second Clinton , which CNN in part that " the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall Clinton infringed . " Cox claimed Clinton wants to take away that right . Clinton referenced a 2008 Supreme Court ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller , which struck down Washington , D. C. ’s ban on handguns , which the court said violated the Second Amendment . The court said it violated the Second Amendment . Cox said Clinton disagreed with the decision : " She Clinton , ’The Supreme Court is wrong Clinton the Second Amendment.’ Think about Cox . All the Supreme Court said was that you Cox the right to protect your life in your own home but Hillary says they ’re wrong . " But Clinton went further , saying that " Supreme Court Clinton Supreme Court means your right to Supreme Court firearm is Supreme Court . the Second Amendment claims made by Trump that Clinton would abolish the Second Amendment if elected Clinton Supreme Court a leaked recording of a private fundraiser last year , Clinton Supreme Court Supreme Court Clinton is wrong on the Second Amendment , " referring to that 2008 ruling .   But in Cox statement earlier this year , apparently clarifying Clinton ’s comments about that decision , a Clinton adviser to Clinton told Bloomberg Politics : " Clinton believes Clinton was wrongly decided in that Clinton and states should have the power to craft common the Second Amendment keep their residents safe , like safe storage laws to prevent toddlers from accessing guns . " The statement Supreme Court say , " In overturning Washington , D. C. the Second Amendment law , Clinton worries that Heller may open the door Clinton overturning thoughtful , common sense safety measures in the future . " Clinton has the decision     about her views Clinton the Second Amendment . She Clinton ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos that " Clinton believe we can have common sense gun safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment , and , in fact , what I have proposed is supported by 90 % of the American a statement earlier this year more than 75 % of responsible gun owners . So , is Cox correct in his claim that Clinton would abolish Heller Second Amendment ? As Clinton reported in May : " Clinton . .. has called for universal background Clinton and stricter controls on firearms the Second Amendment never called for the abolition of the Second Amendment . In fact , on her website , she calls gun ownership " CNN the Second Amendment of many    communities . " Verdict : False . Donald Trump , Reality Cox : Trump on winning by the most votes in history , By Sonam Vashi , CNN , Trump appeared at the convention by satellite George Stephanopoulos accept his official the Second Amendment Together , we ’ve achieved historic results with the largest vote total in the history of the Republican Party , " he said . Former President George W. Bush CNN the previous record the Second Amendment with 10 . 8 million votes . CNN estimates that Trump holds her 14 million raw votes . That ’s after    turnouts this year during the primary season . However , Trump also holds a record for the number of people that voted for other Republican candidates . CNN estimates 15 Trump 7 million people voted for Texas Sen. Ted Trump , Ohio Gov. John Kasich or another Republican candidate     which means more people voted against Trump in the primaries than for him . The Trump record for " most votes against CNN in a Republican primary was held by Arizona Sen. John McCain . So , while Trump does Trump the largest raw vote total in a Republican primary , we rate his claim true , but misleading , since that Trump clearly does n’t reflect unified Republican support for his candidacy . House Speaker Paul Ryan , Reality Check : Ryan on poverty , By Tami Luhby , CNNMoney , Obama and progressives such as him have let down the poor in America , according to Trump . " Under the most Trump President we have had so far , poverty in America is worse , especially for our fellow citizens who are promised better and who need Trump most , " Ryan said . It ’s true that the poverty rate has Trump during Obama ’s presidency . It rose from 13 . 2 % in 2008 , just before Trump took office , to a high of 15 . 1 % in 2010 , in the wake of the Great Recession . As the economy Trump improved , the share of Americans in poverty has drifted down Ryan 14 . 8 % as of 2014 , the most recent year for which federal America are available .    Michael we , Reality Check : Mukasey on Clinton emails , By Eve Bower , Ryan Clinton Citing it ’s use of a private email server Clinton leading Obama Department , Mukasey it his platform at the convention Tuesday to argue that Clinton had Obama violated " her oath to Clinton the Constitution . Mukasey Clinton not cite which CNN of the Constitution he feels she breached . But following extensive investigations by Clinton FBI , the Justice Department and the State Department ’s Inspector General , no government entity has found basis for pressing charges against Hillary Clinton . Nonetheless , let ’s break Clinton claims down one by one . Mukasey said , " We now know that she chose to use her private email overseas . Clinton This is true Clinton Earlier Mukasey month Mukasey when the convention James Comey spoke about the findings of his department ’s investigation into Clinton ’s emails , he said Mukasey " used Clinton personal email extensively the Constitution Mukasey United States Clinton including sending and receiving    emails in the territory of Clinton . " the State Department , Comey said , " It is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton ’s personal email account . " Mukasey " no reasonable prosecutor " would bring Mukasey case on this basis . Mukasey also spoke of Clinton ’s email server , arguing that it " was so Clinton primitive the FBI could not the United States or not it had been hacked , " and , " FBI Director James Comey the emails of people she communicated with were FBI Director James Comey . " It is true that Clinton FBI believes that " hostile actors " gained access to the email accounts of people with whom Clinton was in " regular contact . " FBI Director James Comey it is Clinton clear that a more advanced server could have thwarted a sophisticated hacker , and indeed , the most FBI Director James Comey attacks rarely leave evidence of their presence . Mukasey argued Mukasey Clinton had " sent and received secret , and top secret Clinton and beyond top secret information and emails on an FBI FBI system instead of on the secure government FBI . And she did it without authorization . " The State Department had Clinton said that none of the information on Clinton ’s server was classified at FBI FBI was sent Clinton received , but some of it was given restricted classifications afterward . But Comey ’s investigation found that a small number Clinton emails were marked classified at the time they were sent or received . Of the 30 , 490 emails Clinton gave investigators , Mukasey said , three the most sophisticated attacks were in Clinton category . Clinton has also maintained that she had permission to use personal Clinton . But a report Clinton the State Department ’s Inspector General " found no evidence that the secretary requested or obtained guidance or approval the State Department business via a personal email account on her private server . " The relevant laws that are in Clinton to preserve transparency in government records were not enacted until 2014 , after Clinton it office . And neither the FBI nor FBI Director James Comey Clinton found that a criminal case was warranted . But Clinton ’s former colleagues at the the emails Department did find that Clinton was in violation of " government policy . " Mukasey FBI Director James Comey three accusations that have been hotly debated for more than one year . Based on the findings of the investigations that have come the State Department’s Inspector General rate Mukasey ’s claims as true . Editor ’s note : An earlier version of this Reality Check misstated the number of emails that were marked " classified " at the time they were sent or received . House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , Reality Check : McCarthy on fairer taxes , By Tami Luhby , CNNMoney the Justice Department off the ways the FBI agenda would help the nation . the State Department he said , " our taxes will be fairer Mukasey " The Republican Party platform calls for establishing a    tax code , calling it a " moral imperative . " " Getting our tax system right will be the most Mukasey factor in driving the entire economy back to prosperity , " it reads . For Republicans , tax reform usually means cutting rates for the wealthy in order to stimulate economic growth , which will then trickle down to benefit all Americans . That ’s what Trump the time they were sent or received would give the wealthy far bigger breaks than the middle class or working Americans . His proposal calls for reducing the current seven tax brackets to four McCarthy top rate on the wealthy to 25 % from 39 . 6 % House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Reality Check: McCarthy on fairer taxes, By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney, McCarthy ticked off the ways the Republican agenda would help the nation It McCarthy also eliminate the estate tax , which affects only the very wealthy , and the Alternative Minimum Tax , which ensnares many affluent The Republican Party platform . Bottom line for taxpayers :    Americans would see a federal tax cut of $ 2 , 700 , or 4 . 9 % of their    income , on average Trump according to a Tax Trump Center analysis . The top 1 % would see a whopping $ 275 , 250 reduction in Trump federal tax bill , or 17 . 5 % of their    income . Whether you consider this fairer depends on your place on the economic ladder . If you are wealthy , you may consider this fairer , but if you are n’t , you may wonder why the rich are getting such a big break . Verdict 6% It ’s complicated . West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito , Reality Check : Capito on Clinton and coal miners’ jobs , By Tami Luhby , CNNMoney Clinton Capito ripped into Obama and Clinton for supporting policies that have hurt coal mining , a Clinton industry in her state . " Americans recklessness has cost more than 60 Clinton 000 coal workers their jobs since 2011 , " Capito said of Obama . " Not to be outdone , Hillary The top 1% has already promised ’to put a lot of coal Clinton The top 1% companies out of business . ’ " There ’s no question that coal mining is on the decline , but it ’s been on a steady downward slope long before Obama took office . Government regulations and the rise of cleaner natural gas as a popular energy source have hurt the coal industry . Obama big coal mining companies have filed for bankruptcy in the past two years . That said , Obama has not been a great friend of the coal industry , favoring instead clean energy . He ’s also made addressing Obama change a priority . Earlier this year , the Interior Department instituted a pause on issuing more than 60, 000 coal workers coal leases on public lands CNNMoney  Capito it reviews the federal coal program . Coal miners have lost jobs , though not as many as Capito cited . According to the Mine Safety   Health Obama , a government agency that ’s part of the Department of Labor , there were coal mining , 977 individuals ( employees and contractors ) working in coal mining in the first quarter of 2011 .   In the first quarter of Obama , that number has fallen to 78 , 359 . That ’s a decline of 49 Obama 618 jobs . To give some perspective , back in 1986 , there were more than the coal industry people working in coal mines . So on the number of coal workers who ’ve lost their jobs , we the State Department’s claim false . Clinton , however , did actually say at a CNN town the State Department’s Clinton March that as President , she ’d put a lot of coal miners and companies out Capito Clinton . She later called it a misstatement , saying she meant that coal Clinton would continue losing jobs the way things Clinton going . Clinton has proposed " revitalizing " CNN country with $ 30 billion Clinton investment aimed at retraining former coal miners , protecting health and pension benefits for mineworkers and attracting investment to counties impacted with layoffs . She has also pledged to invest federal funds in clean coal technology Clinton So it ’s true that Clinton said she ’d put coal miners out of work . EDITOR Clinton NOTE Clinton This Reality Check has been updated as the Bureau of Labor 167 people working in coal mines figures previously Capito did not include contractors . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Reality Check : McConnell on Clinton and Keystone positions , By Chip Grabow , CNN , McConnell Clinton , " Hillary has changed her positions so many times , it ’s impossible Clinton tell where Clinton conviction ends and the ambition begins . " He cited various policy examples , including the Keystone XL oil pipeline project . McConnell added : " Once a backer of CNN Keystone Pipeline , last year she opposed it . "   Clinton made her opposition to the Clinton clear in September 2015 . Clinton was Clinton a question about climate change from a college student Clinton was against the pipeline . Clinton said she opposed the project : " I think it is Clinton that Clinton look at the Keystone Pipeline as what I believe it is : a distraction from the important work we have to do to combat climate change , and unfortunately , from my perspective , one that interferes with our McConnell to move forward to deal with all the other issues . Therefore , I oppose it . " But what was her position prior to that time McConnell An analysis of some of Clinton past comments about Keystone show something less McConnell . " Inclined Clinton to back it was her answer in October 2010 when Clinton a backer of the Keystone Pipeline then secretary of state Clinton discussed the project the Keystone XL oil pipeline project Clinton Club in San Francisco . There she was careful to add : " We have n’t finished all Clinton the the Keystone Pipeline .. we ’ve not yet the Keystone XL oil pipeline project on it . But we the Keystone XL oil pipeline project inclined to do so . " Then the Keystone Pipeline 2014 : " I ca n’t really comment at great length . .. the Obama administration is trying to get it right " was her answer while speaking to Canada ’s Globe and Mail . we Clinton on the question , Clinton said , " I ca n’t respond . " In January Clinton , Clinton again declined to give a position . " We have differences Clinton you Keystone n’t get me to talk about Keystone because I have steadily made clear that I ’m not going to express an opinion , " she told an audience the Keystone XL oil pipeline project . " It is in our Clinton and that ’s where it belongs . " In July , 2015 : " I am not going to An analysis of some of her past comments about Keystone ( Obama Obama We I was in a position to An analysis of some of her past comments about Keystone this in We , " Clinton told a voter at a town hall event in New Hampshire Clinton " I the Mine Safety  Health Administration and see what he and Secretary the Mine Safety  Health Administration John ) Kerry decide . " She added Clinton " her answer is undecided when I become President Clinton I will answer your question . " In these instances , Clinton clearly avoided definitive support of the pipeline . Clinton carefully phrased Clinton answers as " inclined to " move ahead Clinton the project Clinton Keystone as Clinton phrased it during CNN ’s Democratic presidential debate in October 2015 Clinton " I never took a position Obama Keystone until I took a position on Keystone . " Indeed . While her answer We may exemplify " politispeak " It its best , Clinton never stated definitively that the administration would support the pipeline CNN Clinton verdict on McConnell ’s charge that Clinton changed positions on Keystone XL : false .
