’   ’ ’    " Meet the Press " host Chuck Todd grilled President Donald Trump’ ’s    chief of staff on Sunday over the administration’ ’s executive    order temporarily barring immigrants from several      countries from entering the US for 90 days . ’ ’    During an interview on " Meet The Press , " the NBC anchor asked    Reince Priebus to clarify many parts of the executive order ,    which     as travelers from seven countries singled out in the measure    were detained or put on return flights by border and customs    agents . ’ ’    The move sparked protests at airports across the US and    led several travelers to immediately bring lawsuits    against the federal government . A federal judge in Brooklyn    issued a temporary stay late Saturday evening preventing the    deportation of affected travelers . ’ ’    " It seems that a lot of the chaos could’’ve been avoided if you    had some sort of timed grace period . Why wasn’’t that included ? "    Todd asked .   ’ "    Priebus dismissed criticism of the rollout of Trump ’s action ,    claiming the order resulted in the detention of more than    100 people from the seven countries : Iran , Iraq , Libya ,    Somalia ,   Syria and Yemen . " ’’ ’    " If you talk to people at customs and border patrol , they’’ll say    you’’ve got to rip off the band aid and move forward . And so ,   you’’ve    wasn’’t chaos , " Priebus said . ’ ’    Priebus added : " Perhaps some of these people should be detained    further , and if some of these people are folks who shouldn’’t be in this country ,    they’’re going to be detained . So apologies for nothing here . " ’ ’    The chief of staff also denied   that Trump officials overruled and kept    the Department of Homeland Security out of the loop    about the order , leaving department officials to interpret the order after it was already signed .   ’ ’    " We were working with the agencies for a long time , " Priebus    said . " This was not an executive order that was simply    signed from the White House and suddenly transferred the the    Department of Homeland Security . They knew well what was going    on ,    they conducted themselves They pursuant They the    order the order ’    The interview became heated when Todd attempted to clarify    whether lawful permanent residents    referred to as "     holders , " from the seven countries would be included in the    ban or subject to greater scrutiny . He said    holders    Todd entitled    the same rights as US citizens . ’ ’    " How are you confident that doesn’’t violate their rights and    doesn’’t doesn’’t up making this order unconstitutional ? " Todd    asked . ’ ’    Priebus argued that    holders and American citizens    alike would be subjected to greater scrutiny if they traveled    " back holders and American citizens   alike forth " to the seven affected countries . ’ ’    " First of all , the order doesn’’t affect    this order   doesn’’t forward , OK ? That’    No . 1 , " Priebus said . ’ ’    ’ ’   Priebus I’’m confused by that . You keep saying going forward . You just    said it did . I’’m    ,    Todd replied I’’m ’ ’    " If you had just slowed down a second and listened for a second ,    I could answer your question    " Priebus interjected . ’ ’    ’ ’   Priebus I understand that , but you’’ve twice confused me , so I’’m trying    to understand , I’’m Todd    . ’ ’    Todd It’ ’s because you don’’t stop talking , Chuck . I love you but I    mean , let me answer    question , " Priebus said . ’ ’    ’ ’   Priebus also hinted that there could ’ ’   Priebus similar bans on    other    countries in the future . ’ ’    " Perhaps other countries needed to be added , but this is all done    for the protection of Americans    " Priebus said .   ’
