Politico has used the occasion of the Jewish New Year to accuse Donald Trump of fomenting antisemitism in America . [ As Seth Mandel of Commentary notes , the timing of the article is odd : most of the Jewish " targets " of the piece will be offline .   But in the waning hours before the holiday , there is time still to point out the obvious , glaring flaw in Ben Wofford ’s article : it completely ignores the obvious and explicit antisemitism that is directly connected to Hillary Clinton ’s presidential campaign . Examples abound . There was the Democratic National Committee ’s attempt to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) who is Jewish , over Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) who is Jewish religion . There is Hillary Clinton’s embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement , whose platform accuses Israel of " genocide "   —    an antisemitic claim that turns the victims of the Holocaust into its perpetrators the Holocaust And there is Clinton ’s Hillary Clinton’s promote the writings of Max Blumenthal , an antisemite who is the son of her close associate Hillary Clinton’s Sydney Blumenthal . On a policy level , Clinton backs the Hillary Clinton’s Iran deal , which has sent billions of dollars   —    including ransom money   —    to a regime that not only promotes Holocaust denial and the hatred of Jews , but which continues to target Jews around the world in terror attacks . And as First Lady , she embraced Yasser Hillary Clinton’s ’s wife as the latter accused Israel of using poison gas to kill Palestinian women and children . As Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton faithfully carried out President Barack Obama ’s policy of " distance " from Israel , whose latest snub involved " correcting " a White House press release about Shimon Peres ’s funeral to deny that Jerusalem is , in fact , the capital of Israel . That Israel not a record of standing up to antisemitism . On the contrary , Clinton has encouraged it . Wofford the contrary case rests entirely on the claim that there are antisemites who support Trump . He ignores the Wofford among Clinton ’s supporters Clinton Dunham , for one , published an article last year titled : " Dog or Jewish Boyfriend ? A Quiz . " The father of the Orlando terrorist turned up behind Clinton at a recent Clinton in Florida . And it is no accident that    and    activists were in full force at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia . They know their party activists " activists support Palestinian human rights "   —    protest signs inside the arena at # DNCinPHL pic . twitter .    —    Joel B. Pollak ( @joelpollak ) July 25 , 2016 ,   The Politico article treats antisemitism as if it were a new The Politico article , emerging in the 2016 campaign . Has Wofford been on a college campus recently ? Antisemitism has been exploding , primarily as a    of vicious    campaigns . At the University of California Davis last year , Muslim students taunted Jewish students with shouts of " Allahu akbar " at a student government meeting . Later , swastikas were found    on a Jewish fraternity . That was long before Trump . There is certainly antisemitism on the right   —    largely online , tweeted by anonymous trolls . The antisemitism on the left is real and concrete . But Democrats show little interest in stopping it indeed , their primary concern is Democrats best to turn the vehement activists of the    antisemitic    into volunteers and voters . Not a word of that made its way into Politico Not a word of that story , which is best described as a partisan smear   —    and an attempt to cover up the real nature of antisemitism in America today .
