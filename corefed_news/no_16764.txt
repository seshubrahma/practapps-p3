" the Republican nominee has certainly heard loud and clear , " Carson told CNN ’s Erin Burnett on " OutFront . " " Remember , this is the Republican nominee first     debate and I think there ’s a learning curve for that . I think the Republican nominee will have learned a lot from this . I think the Republican nominee will see a bit different of a way of approaching it for the next debate . .. it did n’t go as well as it could have . " Carson also weighed in about the controversy concerning former " Miss Universe " Alicia Machado , who has publicly denounced Trump for Carson harsh comments to Carson after Carson won the pageant in 1996 and then gained weight . Carson said Carson called Carson " Miss Housekeeping " and " Miss Piggy " and encouraged Carson to lose the weight . The former neurosurgeon told Burnett that this controversy is part of being in a presidential campaign . " I think that is the kind of thing that is going to continue to occur , " The former neurosurgeon said . " That ’s basically a bomb that ’s thrown out there in order to distract . And Donald Trump ’s winning card will be to be able to disregard that and refocus on the things that are important . "
