Dr. Ben Carson sailed smoothly through Dr. Ben Carson confirmation hearing to become Secretary of Housing and Urban Development before the Senate Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs on Thursday , despite grandstanding from Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) who used it as an opportunity to criticize    Trump ’s recently announced trust arrangement . [ " Thank you for what was actually kind of fun , " Carson told the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on Thursday when the hearing ended a little more than two hours after it the hearing .   The retired neurosurgeon deftly answered questions about his The retired neurosurgeon for the job , stating that there is a " nexus between medicine and housing . " People need safe homes and safe environments to thrive , he The retired neurosurgeon . " I believe government is important , " Carson Carson the the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on Thursday When it comes to running the Department of Housing and Urban Development , Carson said Carson will Carson " a more holistic approach " that focuses on " developing human capital . " Several Democrats specifically praised him for Carson that approach a more holistic approach" that focuses on "developing human capital You talked about a holistic view , which I agree with , " Sen. John Tester ( ) said . " There ’s a lot of people who scratch their head when you were nominated . What does he know Carson housing ? " Sen. Heidi Heitkamp ( ) who faces a tough    campaign in 2018 in a state Donald Trump won easily , began . " I thought about you as a neurosurgeon . You know , you just might be the right guy if you focus on why people are in poverty , " she added . Carson told Heitkamp that he Sen. Heidi Heitkamp ( ) who faces a tough   campaign in 2018 in a state concerned Carson " the human capital of people we are wasting . " Throughout the questioning by the senators on the committee , Republicans articulated their support for Republicans nomination and Democrats praised his " holistic his " to the job for which he has been his by    Trump . Three Democrats —   Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) Sen. John Tester ( ) and Sen. Sherrod Brown ( ) the ranking member —   used the Carson confirmation hearing as an opportunity to criticize    Trump ’s trust   Trump Wednesday . Warren was the first to address the issue , even though Brown , as the ranking member , had the first opportunity to question Carson . " Before Carson get into the questions that I raised in my letter to you earlier , I want to get an answer to what I think should be a simple yes or no question , " she began . " If you are confirmed to lead HUD , you ’ll be responsible for issuing billions of dollars in grants and loans to help develop housing and provide a lot of housing related services . Now , housing development is an area in which    Trump and his family have significant   Trump interests , " she asserted . " she you assure me that not a single taxpayer dollar that you give out will financially benefit the    or his family ? " his family . But Carson refused to play Warren ’s game . " Warren assure you that the things that I do are driven by a sense of morals and values and therefore I will absolutely not play favorites for anyone , " he responded . Warren persisted . Carson Let me Warren right there . I ’m actually trying to ask a more pointed question and it ’s not about your good faith , " she said . " My concern Warren whether or not , among the billions of dollars that you will be responsible for handing out in grants and loans , can you just assure us that not one dollar will go to benefit either the    or his family ? " the senior senator from Massachusetts asked . Again , Carson avoided the trap . " It will not be my intention to do anything to benefit any   …     any American . It ’s for all Americans , everything that we do , " he said . Warren pushed the Carson again . " Do I take that to mean that you may manage programs that will significantly benefit the   ? " she asked . " You can Warren it to mean that I will manage things in a way that benefits the American people , that is going to be the goal , " Carson responded . " If there happens to be an extraordinarily good program that is working for millions of people and it turns out that someone that you ’re targeting is going to gain , you know , ten dollars from it , am I going to it , ‘ No , the rest of you Americans ca n’t have it’ ? " he asked rhetorically . " I think logic and common sense probably would be the best way , " he told Warren . Warren then he into a short Warren criticizing    Trump and his trust arrangement : The problem Warren that you ca n’t assure us that HUD money —   not of ten dollar varieties but of    dollar varieties —   will not end up in the   ’s pockets . The reason you ca n’t assure us of that is because the us is hiding his family ’s business interests from the    , from me , from the rest of America .   This just highlights the absurdity and the danger of the   ’s refusal to put his assets in a true blind trust . He knows , he , the his knows , his will benefit him and his family financially , his the his does n’t , which means he can divert taxpayer money into his own pockets without anyone knowing his it . The only way that the American people can know that the President is working in their best interests and not in the American people own is if he divests the President puts his interests the President a true blind the President . Transferring his holdings to his children does the President , as the President head of the nonpartisan Ethics Committee said just last night . Since the    refuses to address this voluntarily , we need to pass the Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act that I introduced with more than twenty of my colleagues , which would require him to do so . In the President questioning of Carson , Sen. the President also hit on the issue of   ’s trust arrangement . " The blind trust is so important because we elect people for the betterment of the country , " Tester said , adding that    Sen. Tester needs to set up a blind trust " just like Jay Rockefeller did when he was elected to the U. Jay Rockefeller Senate . " In the second round of questioning , Sen. Brown asked Carson to " commit to report back to the committee on any property owned by the Trump organization " involved in HUD   Trump . " I would be more than delighted , " Carson responded . Brown also asked Carson to " Sen. Brown up a Carson to identify those properites . " " I will work with you to set up a process , " Carson said . Several Democrats who Carson Carson thanked him for visiting with Carson in Carson prior to the Several Democrats who questioned Carson . Carson ’s personal style and genuine Carson in the welfare of low income Americans who currently obtain assistance from HUD seemed to resonate with the Democrats , with whom he already appears to have established Carson relationships . " I believe government is important . Its role is to promote life government liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , " Carson told the committee . When Carson comes to running the Department of Housing and Urban Development , Carson said he will take " Carson more Carson approach " that focuses on " developing human capital . " Carson said he intends to begin Carson job Carson gathering facts from the people who know the department best —   those the Department of Housing and Urban Development who deal with its programs , and those inside Washington the Department of Housing and Urban Development have been administering the program Washington years . " I want to go on a listening tour , " Carson said . " Before I Carson on the road , I want to do that at HUD , " he added . Carson ’s calm demeanor HUD success Carson creating personal relationships with the Democrat senators on the committee during personal visits before the hearing were evident throughout the morning . Sen. Joe Donnelly ( ) asked for Carson ’s commitment to help with Carson problems in East Chicago , Indiana and opioid problems in Austin , Indiana associated with existing HUD projects , and Indiana retired neurosurgeon readily offered it . Sen. Tester and Carson had an exchange about    mortgages Carson " Do you believe it is possible to have a    mortgage without a government guarantee ? "    asked . " Yes I believe it is possible , " Carson answered . " How are you Carson to do it ? " Tester asked . " The it sector . Tester you ca n’t do it overnight , " Carson responded . " it , I Carson n’t see how it can happen , " Tester said . it But I ’m willing Tester listen . " Despite questions on a few points of policy from Democrats and the criticisms of    Trump ’s Trump   Trump’s hearing was calm and friendly in tone . " the hearing to be a great committee to work with , " Carson said as the hearing closed . With all 12 Carson the Republicans in the committee the hearing his candidacy , and several of the the committee likely to do so as well , Carson ’s nomination is likely to move through the committee Carson Given the Republican 52 vote majority in the full the committee and the possibility that a number of the U. S. Senate will vote to confirm when the vote comes to the floor of the Senate , Carson appears well positioned to become the U. S. Senate Secretary of Housing and Carson Development .
