President Barack Obama ’s chief economist says Washington is imposing the economic pain of five simultaneous recessions on    Americans , thereby pushing millions of    men off jobs , out of the workforce , and into poverty . [ Roughly 10 percent of American " prime age " men , or 7 million men aged 25 to 54 , have dropped out of the nation ’s workforce of 150 million . They are not trying to get jobs , and are not participating in the nation’s labor force .   " This [ dropout ] is caused by policies and institutions , not by technology , " admitted Jason Furman Furman We should n’t accept it as inevitable , " he told a Brookings Institute expert , Dave Wessel on   August 10 .   Furman outlining the huge problem , Furman suggested a few glib and unrealistic fixes ,   such as greater education . But he ignored the    gorilla in the federal government ’s labor policy   —    Furman    policy that annually sends a flood of two million foreign workers into the U. S. labor market just as four million young Americans start looking for their first jobs .   That     policy has an enormous impact on college graduates just as four million young Americans on    and    the   policy that annually sends a flood of two million foreign workers into the U. S. labor market investment locations , and on hiring decisions . Washington and the establishment media largely ignore the impact because    immigration gradually shifts wealth and political power from ordinary Americans towards    Americans , especially investors , employers , and political advocates .   In his conversation with Wessel , Furman described the scale of worker dropout and the damage done to the dropout workers : The fraction of prime age men who are working or looking for work has fallen continuously since the 1950s . In the early 1950s , 98 percent of men in that age bracket had a job    …      [ or ] were actively looking for one . Today , that fraction has fallen down to 88 percent .    …      Understand it is quite large . The difference between a recession and a normal economic period is maybe two percentage points on the employment population ratio    …      so this is something that is more like 10 percent age points [ five recessions ] stretched over a long period of time . In some sense [ this   ] is bigger than the difference between a recession and a boom , and the impact it has , the evidence is very clear that    …      when you ’re talking about someone who is not married , who has less than a    degree , there ’s a good chance that [ unemployment ] is not a choice , and it is associated with depression , with drug use , with suicide , with a range of bad outcomes for people . Public officials have largely ignored the dramatic discovery that the death rate among white Americans is rising amid the lousy economy and increases in    most of which is hitting    and    class Americans .   The dropout problem is not caused by technology , Furman said , because other countries have managed the problem better . " We ’ve actually had a much bigger decline than all but one [ major ] economy    …      [ and ] Germany has seen an increase in labor force participation , " he said .   Instead , Furman says low wages are the primary cause of the workforce Furman . " The amount [ Furman money ] that employers would want to hire them for some reason has gone down .    …      That ’s consistent with what we employers in the states and in the aggregate , " Furman said . Wessel prodded Furman to explain : " Your hypothesis is that they ’re not Furman for work because they Furman much know that    wants to hire them or if they got a job , they would not be enough money to justify the they of working they whatever else , " he said . " Exactly , " responded Furman . Furman offered a few possible policy fixes Wessel this      problem . But all of Furman proposed Furman would allow progressives in government to play a larger role in training or recruitment Furman or provide companies with government contracts to hire more workers , or spend taxpayer funds to effectively boost salaries to companies’ workers . The higher compensation could be paid via      or      programs similar to the Earned Income Tax Program , Furman said .   Furman , a progressive economist who works for Pres . Obama , did not offer any    fixes that would bypass government cooperation with business .   In fact , his proposals for government    would enlarge the existing      subsidies that allow many company owners to Obama by hiring Americans at such low wages that millions of Americans have already dropped out of the workforce .   If the    minimum wage is raised , Furman insisted , " more people [ will ] want to work , and they ’re more motivated to work . " But these Americans may not be able to successfully more people and get hired at worksites already filled with more people and their immigrant foremen .   During their interview , neither Wessel nor Furman hinted at the simplest    more people : stopping the    annual more people of two million foreign Furman which lowers the wages paid to each annual group of four million young Americans . If the     labor policy was ended , employers would soon run out of Americans to hire , and would then start offering higher wages   —    and training   —    to recruit some of the 7 million American    men who have given up working . That ’s how salaries for    Americans rose briefly in the boom years of 1998 and 1999 , and why the auto companies recruited so many southern African Americans during the 1940s , 1950s , and 1960s . That    process is also why agriculture companies are now pleading with Washington for more immigrant workers .   If there ’s an actual shortage of American workers , employers might even more workplaces out of urban centers   —    heavily populated by immigrants   —    and then establish facilities and jobs in the exurban and rural areas where unemployment is higher . That ’s partly why employers moved    plants out of Chicago and the Northeast in the 1980s . Companies would also hire Americans to build    machines , thereby boosting Americans’ productivity and salaries .   But Obama , most Democrats , and many Republicans   —    especially House Speaker Paul Ryan   —    do not want to slow the huge annual inflow of immigrants , says Mark Krikorian , the director at the Center for Immigration Studies , which favors a reduction in the annual inflow of legal immigrants . " It is OK with them if less skilled American workers suffer [ providing ] a lot of workers abroad benefit   — Obama, most Democrats, and many Republicans  —   especially House Speaker Paul Ryan  —    [ because ] they do n’t really see themselves as having a special loyalty to their own country , " Krikorian less skilled American workers suffer [providing] a lot of workers abroad .   In contrast less skilled American workers suffer [providing] a lot of workers abroad Donald Trump is pushing for a less skilled American workers suffer [providing] a lot of workers abroad labor policy in the 2016 election . His policy would quickly reduce unemployment and drive up wages , according to a critical Wall Street study a     labor policy in the 2016 election a supporter of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton . Given the economic evidence , " it seems hard to avoid the conclusion that flooding the    labor market is bad for American workers , and we ’ve seen the result in the dropping    participation rate , " he said : Obviously , it is not all due to immigration   —    trade , mechanization [ Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton a role ]   —    but the one thing that we have control over is the supply of new workers being imported through immigration , and when the percentage of    men who are working is down , there ’s simply no excuse for importing more people to compete with them .   Immigration cuts are n’t going to fix the problem on their own , but they have men who are working be part of a solution , and the reason    —    Immigration cuts if you do Immigration cuts care about the other aspects of immigration   —    is the fact that it is one thing that the government can control relatively easily . We ca n’t effect the process of automation , and robot trucks are going to be putting thousands of truck drivers out of work over the next decade or two    …      [ reducing ] immigration is a tool that is relatively easy to use , and the fact that we are going the other way   —    importing more people and Hillary Clinton and Obama would like to dramatically increase the high rate   —    is outrageous . Furman did not respond to questions from Breitbart News .   At other events , when talking to his fellow economists , Furman has said that a shortage of workers would raise salaries . However , when Furman by this reporter Furman 2014 on this issue of immigration supply , employer demand , and Americans’ wages , Furman waffled and dissembled .   That professional    is understandable because Furman ’s boss   —    Obama Furman —    is ideologically and politically committed to large scale immigration Furman he believes will reduce marketplace salaries among Americans , including among African Americans . Wessel is a former reporter for Furman Wall Street Journal , and is familiar with the theory Wessel supply and demand . Asked by Breitbart   News why he did not prod Furman to explain the impact on wages of the    labor supply , Wessel wavered : If Furman ’re talking    men , it ’s a group of people who Wessel immigrants and natives . We have a certain pool of that , Breitbart  News and ] it is not clear to me that we can explain a decline [ in the number ] of workers    …     Wessel by saying that there We ’ve had increase in the supply . When Breitbart News pointed out that a larger supply of immigrant labor We reduces wages and incentives to work , Wessel Breitbart  News " That might be the case    …      to some extent . " Wessel
