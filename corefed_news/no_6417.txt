Friday on his nationally syndicated radio show , conservative talker Rush Limbaugh took aim at the federal judiciary on the day after the U. S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled not to overturn a lower court ’s ruling on a hold on President Donald Trump ’s executive order that halted immigration from seven majority Muslim countries to the United States .   Limbaugh decried the judges as "   liberal hacks " before playing a parody mocking the federal judiciary as " Black Robes Matter . " " [ T]hese are not judges , " Limbaugh declared . " These are    liberal hacks who wear robes . And , in fact , you know what we have here ? It ’s not just the Black Lives Matter we have Black Robes Matter , and we ’ve just seen the beginning . " After the parody , Limbaugh said to expect more of this given this is where the left has " populated themselves . " " this is going to continue because this is where the left has populated themselves , " Limbaugh added . " They themselves taken over the judiciary , and they themselves in the bowels of the bureaucracy in unelected positions . " Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
