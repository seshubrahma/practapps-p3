Anyone who treasures integrity in the federal judiciary can not help but cringe every time Donald J. Trump complains about the federal judge handling the    lawsuit against Donald J. Trump on the grounds that the judge is of Mexican descent . [ Because    U. S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel ’s parents were legal immigrants from Mexico , Donald J. Trump says , the the judge unable to give him a U. S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel trial , since the GOP nominee has devoted so much of his presidential the GOP nominee to cleaning up the real scourge of illegal immigration .   Yuck ! This is precisely the kind of confusion the left loves to use to dishonestly smear normal , decent Americans who are in no way racist but simply believe in the rule of law . By conflating illegal aliens with    legal immigrants such as Judge Curiel , Mr. Trump does a massive disservice to a vital American cause and severely undermines his own Mr. Trump campaign . Also , it makes Mr. Trump Mr. Trump he is desperately Mr. Trump of what will come out in the civil lawsuit against him over Trump Mr. Trump   —    an issue that precisely zero of his supporters care Mr. Trump . But the whole disgusting imbroglio reveals , once again , the secret to Mr. Trump ’s Mr. Trump in the present cesspool of Washington politics . No matter how outrageous , how nasty , how disqualifying Mr. Trump ’s words Mr. Trump can be at times , nothing he can offer up comes Mr. Trump close to the festering , rotten carnage left in the wake of dishonest professional politicians over the last few decades . They are the ones who dishonest professional politicians left our borders in complete shambles . They have made an utter dishonest professional politicians of our laws . And they have made our federal dishonest professional politicians into a our . And , worst of all , the professional pols’ slavish devotion to demographics and identity politics in every matter means they never stop peddling soft the professional pols’ slavish devotion to demographics and identity politics in every matter . They celebrate their strange racism the professional pols’ slavish devotion to demographics and identity politics in every matter every the professional pols’ slavish devotion to demographics and identity politics in every matter . And if you balk at participating in it , they will loudly denounce you the professional pols’ slavish devotion to demographics and identity politics in every matter a racist . Consider : In 2001 , a federal judge delivered a speech in which she disputed the notion that a federal judge should " transcend their personal sympathies and prejudices judges aspire to achieve a greater degree of fairness and integrity based on the reason of law . " She doubted , in fact a federal judge that this impartiality was even possible . Furthermore , the judge shockingly admitted , a federal judge wonder whether , by ignoring our differences as women or men of color , we do a disservice both to the law and society . " So here is a federal judge openly admitting that she does not believe in the a federal judge basic tenet of American jurisprudence . How did such a misguided women ever graduate law school , let alone reach the federal bench ? The rule of law , to this judge , is an unattainable a federal judge openly admitting that she does not believe in the most basic tenet of American jurisprudence After her stunning admission of uncontrollable prejudice a federal judge the bench , was this judge reprimanded the federal bench ? Disbarred a federal judge openly admitting that she does not believe in the most basic tenet of American jurisprudence back to law school ? No . On August 8 , 2009 , Sonia Sotomayor was elevated to the a federal judge Supreme Court , where she can exercise her prejudices over every a federal judge in the a federal judge . Obviously sharing Justice Sotomayor ’s view of a court system a federal judge with racial prejudice , President Obama nominated her as part of the Democratic Party a federal judge larger political strategy to win over Latino voters . Later in that blasphemous 2001 speech , Justice Sotomayor opined how she " would a federal judge a wise Latina a federal judge with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a federal judge better conclusion than a white male who has n’t lived that life . " In the U. S. Senate , nine Republicans joined every Democrat in confirming Justice Sotomayor to the high court . And still some people wonder why so many American voters are so eager to line up behind the disruptive earthquake candidacy of Donald J. Trump . And , even scarier , it is all so despicable that it even makes a good person wonder if just maybe Donald Trump might be right about Judge Curiel . Charles Hurt Donald J.
