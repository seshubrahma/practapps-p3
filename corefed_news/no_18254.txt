’   ’ "    The New York Times   on Saturday    about FBI Director James Comey ’s decision to revisit the    investigation into Hillary Clinton ’s emails 11 days before the    presidential election , offering fresh insight into FBI Director James Comey’s ’s    thinking and sparking a new debate over whether FBI Director James Comey’s cost Clinton    the   presidential election . " ’    Nate Silver , the editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight , said The    Times ’’ report showed " the case that the Comey letter   —    or the    media’ ’s handling of the letter   —    cost Clinton Clinton the   presidential election    painfully obvious . " ’ ’    On October 28 , Comey wrote Comey letter to Congress saying that the    FBI had learned of " the existence of emails that appear to be    pertinent " to the investigation into Clinton’ ’s email server ,    which had originally been closed in July . The emails emails that appear to be   pertinent" to the investigation into Clinton’’s email server,   which had originally been closed in July discovered as    FBI the   FBI former Rep. Anthony Weiner’ ’s    laptop , which he shared with his former Rep. Anthony Weiner’ , Huma former Rep. Anthony Weiner’ , a top Clinton    aide . ( Weiner had been accused of exchanging sexually explicit    texts with a     girl . ) ’ ’    The letter was promptly released by Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz , the    chair of the House Oversight Committee , and dominated the    headlines of major media outlets in the days leading up to the    election .   and Clinton’ ’s poll    numbers dropped by 3 points over subsequent days , Silver pointed    out   —    a    slip political scientists attributed to " the    Comey effect,"according to The Times . ’ ’    Then , on Election Day , Clinton lost Florida , Wisconsin ,    Pennsylvania , and Michigan   —    each by less than 1 percentage    point . ’ ’ ’ " ’t’t’tIt ’s a fairly     case . But the media ’s election    have mostly ignored it because it implicates election    media election    judgement the media ’    " Not complicated , " Silver said . " Clinton was up by a lot . Comey    letter hits . Treated as massive story . Suddenly she was up by      . Clinton loses narrowly . " ’ Clinton    Silver received pushback for concluding that Comey ’s letter   —      Comey    result of weeks of deliberation over how the FBI    should proceed after it uncovered the new emails in early the FBI        —    was so consequential . " ’    Many say Clinton’ ’s loss was her own fault and she has been Clinton’    the Comey Clinton’ as a scapegoat    ( Her campaign has . )    Journalist Clinton’ Fournier , for example , shot back at Silver’ ’s    argument with a link to a piece he wrote in July 2016 titled    Journalist Ron Fournier Hillary Has No One to Blame But Clinton’ . " ’ ’    " Clinton’ I wrote this column , you were still predicting a Clinton    win , " Fournier told Silver . " Nice work Journalist Ron Fournier " ’ ’    The     quickly descended into a feud over " how    probability works , " as Silver put it . But few doubt that Comey’ ’s    revelation had a negative effect on Clinton’ ’s candidacy , even if    it was not enough to swing the election at the last minute . ’ "    Whereas many Clinton backers felt vindicated by Comey ’s    revelation last month that the FBI had been investigating Trump    and his associates for their ties to Russia Trump    last July ,    others were outraged that Comey broke FBI protocol to disclose    Comey existence FBI new Clinton emails just days before the    election , but did n’t tell    that Trump was also under FBI    investigation until four months after FBI . " ’    The New the   election reported Comey desired to shield the FBI from    what he perceived to FBI General Loretta Lynch’       Comey toward Clinton .    prompted him to handle the Clinton and    Trump General Loretta Lynch’ " Comey starkly different ways Clinton " ’ "    The different approaches did n’t go unnoticed . Democratic Rep.    Jerrold Nadler confronted Comey about the appearance of a double    standard during a congressional hearing , after      Minority Leader Harry Reid , who had been briefed on aspects of    the    probe by CIA Director John Brennan , wrote a    letter to Comey imploring him to go public . " ’    Comey After Jerrold Nadler investigated Secretary Clinton , you made a decision to    explain publicly who you interviewed and why , " Nadler said to    Comey . " You also disclosed documents , including Comey those    interviews . Why should n’t the American people have the same level    of information about your investigation with those associated    with Mr. Trump ? " ’ ’    According to The Times , " Mr. Comey never considered disclosing    the case . Doing so Comey believed , would have undermined an active    investigation and cast Comey suspicion on people the FBI could       be sure were implicated .
