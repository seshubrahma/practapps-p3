He knows exactly Barack Obama he ’s doing Barack Obama He is trying Barack Obama change this country Barack Obama He wants America to America like Barack Obama rest of the world .

S. will issue more green cards to foreign nationals than the population of the three early 2016 primary states The U. S. Iowa , New Hampshire , and South Carolina   —    combined .
