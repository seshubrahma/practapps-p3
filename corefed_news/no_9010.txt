We have our own identity They we are not a theocratic nation we have never been a theocratic nation They The American policy is always pushing for theocratic regimes and then when you have We theocratic regime you We crying . One consistent theme We the Egyptians who spoke with Breitbart News was the deep distrust of Hillary Clinton . Dr. Morgan said of Egyptian President   Hillary Clinton with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on Monday : President    wanted to Breitbart News Hillary Clinton candidates because he did not want to give Hillary a Trump Administration to use and abuse an indirect endorsement from a meeting with a President like   . President    as she is , she was going to go President    into the media and say , Hillary oh I have a good relationship with this man , I know foreign policy’ so he made sure that he would Hillary Trump as Hillary to make sure the America public does n’t think he supports Trump’s .

Some sort of us the Muslim Brotherhood administration Egypt us Administration , and the Muslim Brothers . We know very well that they the Muslim Brotherhood they burned and destroyed over us churches in Egypt , and they killed a lot of Christians . They killed and are still killing a lot of Egyptians priests men us soldiers . At the same time the Obama administration is refusing Obama deal with the Muslim Brothers as a terrorist group . Gad said that   us a general should not Some sort of cooperation between the American administration, Obama Administration, and the Muslim Brothers taken to mean Some sort of cooperation between the American administration, Obama Administration, and the Muslim Brothers the Obama administration a " military dictatorship " as Hillary Clinton claimed Some sort of cooperation between the American administration, Obama Administration, and the Muslim Brothers " Yes ,    has a Some sort of cooperation between the American administration, Obama Administration, and the Muslim Brothers background but he saved Egypt , " Gad said .
