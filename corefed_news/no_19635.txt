Your ad buys are supporting a misogynistic , racist ,    fake news site .   can help .   ’ ’      The Sleeping Giants account says 255 companies have pulled ads      from Breitbartas of Thursday . Of 255 companies , Kellogg ’s ,      the company behind a dizzying array of breakfast and other      foods , has gotten the most attention . After Kellogg removed      its Kellogg from Breitbart on Tuesday ,      the site responded with a . " Boycotting      Breitbart for presenting mainstream American ideas is an      act of discrimination and intense      prejudice , " Breitbart         Alexander Marlow . " If you      serve Kellogg ’s products to your family , you are serving up      bigotry at your breakfast table . " Naturally , this inspired a      liberal    to buy up Kellogg ’s Kellogg :    ’ " ’t’t’tOK , let ’s get all these products sold out in California , Brooklyn , and the Upper West Side !   " ’      Sleeping Giants’ approach here is n’t new , of course . Pressuring      advertisers to drop support for broadcasters or publishers is a        political strategy , one notably embraced in the      past by conservative groups like   and the   and coordinated      by phone or mail . But in coordinating online to attack digital      advertising , Sleeping Giants is taking a page from a group that      recently showed how easily a dedicated group can kneecap a      website ’s support .    ’ ’      In 2014 , angry members of the Gamergate movement went after      Gawker Media , including flagship      site Gawker , . Gamergate was spawned out of      a   over inaccurate      claims that a writer at the Gawker Media      site Kotaku had positively reviewed an indie      game by a developer he was dating . Incensed , Gamergate trolls Gamergate launched a vicious campaign against the developer and other      women that included violent threats and the leaking of personal      information .    ’ ’      After Gawker writer Sam Biddle   about the need to bully      Gamergate ’s Gamergate nerds , " the movement ’s troll army built a        effort around Gawker ’s Gawker of      bullying . " Your company is listed as an advertising affiliate      with Gawker , " Gawker   sample email      read . " In light of Mr. Biddle ’s Gawker writer Sam Biddle   and      [ Gawker editor Max Read ’s ] support of said      comments , I urge you to withdraw said advertising support from      Gawker and all its affiliates . This     Gawker National Bullying      Awareness Month , and these comments are unacceptable in a      society where several thousand people commit suicide each year      due to bullying . "    ’ ’      Adobe and BMW were   among the      companies that pulled their campaigns from Gawker Adobe and BMW . So      damaging was the flight of advertisers that Read would      later   as one      potential culprit in the site ’s demise .    ’ ’      The Gamergate campaign was at once more vitriolic and more      sophisticated than the Sleeping Giants effort seems to be . On      Reddit and elsewhere , Gamergaters hyperventilated over the      alleged malice of individual writers and compiled lists of PR      and marketing executives to contact . One Reddit      user that he ’d spent more      than two hours constantly refreshing Gawker pages to put      together a more complete list of the site ’s advertisers and had      even gone as far as using virtual private networks to simulate      visits from Romania so he could document foreign he :    ’ ’      " What I ’d missed about Gamergate , "   " was that      they were gamers —   they had spent years they a tolerance      for highly repetitive tasks . "    ’ ’      Sleeping Giants , by contrast , is more dependent on casual      participation . There ’s no doggedly determined group        every appearance of a new ad      on Breitbart . Nor are Sleeping Giants’ protesters      acting out a personal vendetta ; they ’re driven by Sleeping Giants’ protesters      about      the racism , misogyny , and xenophobia on display      at Breitbart , a site with , for example , a " black      crime " vertical that once   Muslims in the      West a " ticking time bomb . "    ’ ’      Yet the two campaigns share a basic core strategy . Targeting      advertisers —   the only major source of revenue available to most      online media —   is the surest way to bring a site to its knees . Ad a site representatives , not terribly worried about the value of ads at      niche sites      like Breitbart and Gawker in      a world with millions of others to choose from , may well cave      to avoid the PR fallout of a viral effort . The losses incurred      by Gawker demonstrated that these Gawker of      attacks can inflict real damage , even if they do n’t ultimately these kinds of     attacks bring sites down . Breitbart ’s own Allum Breitbart      wrote as much in the wake of the        campaign , in a rhapsodic piece      praising Gamergate for taking advantage of the influential      site ’s inherent vulnerability :    ’ ’      Thanks to Sleeping Giants , perhaps a better underdog story has      arrived . But for better and worse , online activists have shown      just how easily the digital economy allows agitators to make      web publishers feel their pain .    online activists
