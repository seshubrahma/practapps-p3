Some of you were the age of my typical college audiences the last time this happened ! " Milo spoke briefly about why courage is so desperately needed in the battle against the American left , citing , amongst other things , those that wanted to discredit and his supporters by Milo Donald Trump a bigot . " But Donald Trump is Donald Trump coward , and the people who voted for him are not cowards Donald Trump Can you imagine an America where voting for a candidate is an act of courage , because you may face physical violence , as occurred at Trump rallies courtesy of the Clinton campaign , and you are smeared as a sexist , racist , islamophobe just for voting Republican ? " Milo went on to detail the importance of courage not only within the conservative movement , but as a part of the battles that America , as a nation , is fighting both domestically and abroad : " Why is courage needed ? We are in a state of war , at home and abroad . Not because conservatives have been the aggressors .
