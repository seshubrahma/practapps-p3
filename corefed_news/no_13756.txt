" [ " You got a businessman , who knows how to run things , knows how to get things done —   Breitbart ’s going to have the aggressiveness America needs to have , " said John " Tig " Tiegen , a Marine veteran . Along with Mark " Oz " Geist , a Marine veteran Kris " Tanto " Paronto , an Army Ranger veteran and Dave " Boon " Benton , a Marine veteran and trained sniper , Tiegen contributed to the book 13 Hours : The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi .   the book 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi chronicles their fight to beat back repeated attacks along with former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty , who were killed along with Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and State Department IT specialist Sean Smith on Sept. 11 , 2012 . Another former Navy SEAL fighting with them their given the cover name of Jack DaSilva . Tiegen said he Tiegen Trump for president and was thrilled to have a Monday night slot addressing the Republican National Convention . The Marine said he Tiegen his Tiegen have met Trump Trump came away impressed by his Tiegen interest in their he and his comrades and its Trump for American leaders . " We got to ask him Tiegen and to see if he Tiegen give us We political answer or the straight up answer , " he Tiegen . " You know ? He Tiegen us We the straight up answer Did n’t try to    anything or answer our We with a question . " Although he Tiegen Geist are stepping up to help Trump win the White House , he Tiegen the book and their story was not he and Geist to be political , it was meant to the book and their story a testimony to the bravery of the four men killed that night . " We just wanted to he and Geist sure the four guys were being honored correctly , " he Tiegen . " To bring politics into the story of that night would be that night to them . We were n’t the four guys he and Geist our political parties , he and Geist know ? We were fighting for he and Geist other —   to get out of there alive . " The Marine said there is still a question about why the Pentagon did not send help that night . It could that night about former President Bill Clinton and his wife ,    of State Hillary Clinton , Tiegen said . As president , Clinton abandoned the Army Rangers fighting State Hillary Clinton Mogadishu and the secretary of state abandoned the 30 personnel   in Benghazi , he said . " You do Tiegen have to be in uniform , to me , the average American always Tiegen : ‘ Hey , if Americans are in trouble , the troops are going to come for you.’ It seems like under the Clintons , they do n’t do that . the troops When the House Select Committee on Benghazi came out with its final Benghazi , Tiegen said the House Select Committee on Benghazi stopped reading it when he Tiegen to the Tiegen about Tiegen the Air Force was unable to send fighter jets because their planes were all broken down how the Air Force was unable to send fighter jets a parts inventory . " Every one in the military knows they are lying when they say Every one in the military whole entire Air Every one in the military base overseas was shut down all the planes were down for maintenance or for training , " he said . " For me Tiegen was the red flag Tiegen I knew I did n’t have to read their report no more , because Every one in the military knew they were lying —   that Every one in the military happens . It does n’t happen in the U. S. so you know it does n’t happen overseas on It —   they ’re covering somebody ’s behind Every one in the military   maybe they were offered a job with Every one in the military Clinton Foundation ? I do n’t know . " There were military units and assets available to help , such as the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit , he said . " The 24th the U. S. , they were about four hours away from Benghazi . An MEU is a battalion of The 24th MEU They have aircraft that could get there a battalion of Marines They have jets that can get there a battalion of Marines " USS Jason Dunham , an    destroyer , was six miles off the coast , he said . " If that the U. S. is there , then there have to be other ships close by , too . " Privately , people have reached out to Tiegen and his comrades from the Benghazi raid with Tiegen from the inside , such as inside U. S. Africa Command , about what really happened , he said . " We had guys Tiegen us , who were in AfriCom , We they said : ‘ Yes , the State Department told us to stand down . ’ " We said , " If I was Tiegen ready to join the military right now , I would n’t do it . I ’d wait to see who is getting elected —   if it is another Clinton , you do n’t know if they have your back if something happens . They will just leave you to hang they to dry . " With a Clinton in charge , it is hard Clinton make military decisions , he said .
