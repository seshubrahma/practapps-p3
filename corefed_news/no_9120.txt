Bizarre . That ’s the only word to describe how " in the bag " NBC News is for Hillary Clinton . You ’d almost think Hillary Clinton owns them . You ’d almost think Hillary Clinton ’s blackmailing or bribing them . Hillary Clinton must have photos of the head of the NBC News division and anchorman Lester Holt in bed with someone very shocking . It ’s that bad .   Can you even imagine if Donald Trump served in a presidential cabinet and sold out his Donald Trump and government contracts in return for donations to his Donald Trump ? It would be the biggest news story in America . The FBI would be leading him Donald Trump in handcuffs right now .
