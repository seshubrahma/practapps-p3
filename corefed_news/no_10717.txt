Sen. Ted Cruz says Sen. Ted Cruz would consider    the GOP presidential nominating contest if , against Sen. Ted Cruz assumptions , Sen. Ted Cruz wins Nebraska ’s primary today . [ Sen. Ted Cruz suspended his campaign Sen. Ted Cruz the Republican presidential one week ago after a loss in Indiana .   " We came up short in this election , I would have preferred it otherwise this election The movement still continues and that ’s what gives me encouragement , " said Cruz in a Tuesday morning interview on the Glenn Beck radio program on SiriusXM . Later in the interview a Tuesday morning interview on the Glenn Beck radio program on SiriusXM Cruz desire to see a " President we can trust . " He spoke Cruz temperament saying , " we need to watch and see what the candidates say and do . " That spurred the question to Cruz from Cruz sidekick Pat Glenn Beck : would the Texas senator consider getting back in the Republican primary race if Nebraskans " miraculously " voted Cruz the winner in the state ’s primary election that same day . " I am not holding my breath . My assumption is that that will not happen , " replied Cruz . Cruz listen , let ’s be very clear , if there is a path to victory , we launched this campaign intending to win . The reason we suspended the we last week is with Indiana ’s loss I did n’t see a viable path to victory . If that changes , we will certainly we accordingly . Earlier in the interview Cruz said Cruz while the result of the Republican nomination process was not what he had Cruz for he and Cruz Heidi were thankful for the opportunity to be a " part of what was just an incredible grassroots movement . " The suspended 2016 presidential candidate hit hard on the role of the media . This election will be studied for the role of the media and the media network executives , that they made in terms This election promoting the candidate that they had chosen , This election wanted to win This election Trump has received now over $ 3 billion in free airtime . Strikingly , ya know that last 30 days , he had $ 500 Trump dollars in free airtime , 90 percent of which was positive . To put that in perspective in the entire 13 months of the campaign , the aggregate coverage of my campaign was about the campaign billion dollars worth . That has a dramatic effect on the polls when every network becomes effectively the SuperPAC for the candidate they want to win the every network and we ’re about to see that same ferocious fury now turn against Donald in an effort to elect Hillary . And there ’s now doubt we need to think hard about what is the role of a handful of network executives in manipulating and trying to deceive the voters because I think it ’s a very dangerous the voters we have right now . we also told Cruz that his organization has been inundated Beck people either wanting Cruz to run third party Cruz Beck said he did n’t Beck Cruz Beck do that ) Cruz wanting Cruz to support Trump . Cruz commented , " we Beck n’t do that we " He asked Cruz what the Beck thinks Cruz supporters Beck . This Beck a choice every voter is going to have to make and I would note that it ’s not a choice that This as the voters have to make today . The Republican convention is n’t for another two and a half months . The election is n’t for another six months . You and I both want to support a conservative . We want to support someone who we get the burden of Washington off of small businesses and bring back jobs and economic growth . We want to support someone who we defend the Constitution , defend the Bill of Rights , religious liberty , the second amendment . We want to defend someone who we stand by our friends and allies including especially we nation of Israel . We want to defend someone who we be a strong , serious Commander In Chief . Cruz indicated that the conservative movement was divided during the election . " I think the conservative movement remains strong and the conservative movement said Cruz , who said that when conservatives are divided they are less effective . This fight was conservatives a lot more than one campaign or one candidate . This fight is about principles that are eternal This fight free market principles that built America , that allowed millions of small businesses to lift hundreds of millions out of poverty and to prosperity . Those principles are as true today as they were The free market principles that built America of our country ’s history . The free market principles that built America constitutional liberties in the Bill of Rights that protect our    rights from being violated by the federal government . Those rights are true and as valid today as they our   rights throughout history . And so the movement continues our   rights What my energy is directed at , what my focus is directed at is continuing to strengthen and speak for that movement . Cruz was asked about a celebrity factor in the movement and the possibility of a Will      ticket in the future . Cruz replied , " One of the disturbing things of this election Cruz and there are many , is it opens the this election for what comes next and what comes next this election not likely to be sound , stable leaders with good judgement and the understanding of the problems facing this country , our economy and the challenges and threats facing us across the world . " Cruz said his next step is heading our to Washington to go Cruz to Cruz U. S. Senate and fight for the jobs , freedom and security platform he ran on during his presidential campaign . When asked about the Cruz of a third Cruz run for those that " think like " him , Cruz said , " I do n’t think that ’s Cruz likely Cruz " He said he does think that it ’s imperative to get the Cruz of Cruz off of the back of small businesses . " I ’m very Washington that the odds are increasing that we simply keep going down the same road , we do n’t fix those problems and people end up hurting even more we " He said that is where is focus is going to be in Cruz to the Senate . " I believe we ’re going to accomplish that , but it just may take more time . " Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana
