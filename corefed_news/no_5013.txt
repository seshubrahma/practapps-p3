In a    leap of reason , a several journals and news outlets have accused Donald Trump of " environmental racism " by pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord . [ As Breitbart News reported earlier , Donald Trump has already been blamed for a " war on the environment " tantamount to genocide . Now , his Donald Trump have upped the ante , projecting a nefarious racial tone onto the Donald Trump .   Essence magazine said that Donald Trump had Donald Trump his war on people Donald Trump color in America " when he announced the United Donald Trump would withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord . Blavity , a website that caters to people of color , said that Trump ’s decision " Donald Trump environmental racism , " insisting that climate change is " inherently a black issue and not just a ‘ human issue . ’ " The Atlantic went so far as to suggest that environmental racism is " the new Jim Crow , " referring to laws that segregated blacks and whites in their use of public schools , public places , transportation , restrooms and restaurants . Since it may not be evident to readers how a refusal to bind America to a certain level of carbon dioxide emissions constitutes racism , these same outlets have helpfully connected the dots , explaining how neglect of environmental concerns is an attack on blacks . " If Climate Change persist ( sic ) and the world ’s average temperature rises more than two degrees Celsius , " Blavity writer Dominic A. Williams contends , " it would mean widespread extinctions , changing weather patterns , droughts , strong storms , rising sea levels and consequently the disappearance of coastal cities , and a plethora of not yet realized consequences . " These    disasters , Williams insists , will disproportionately Blavity writer Dominic A. Williams people of color . Environmental Racism , he writes , " can Blavity writer Dominic A. Williams described as a lack of access to healthy environments and disproportionate exposure to pollutants . This means that predominantly black neighborhoods are more likely to suffer from polluted air and water than white neighborhoods . " As Breitbart News noted earlier this week , the Paris climate accord has nothing whatsoever to do with " polluted air and water " and only seeks to regulate the emissions of carbon dioxide , a colorless , odorless ,    gas that is a part of a healthy environment . Be that as it may , Williams eventually gets to the real bone of contention . " In addition to causing health crisis , " he argues , " Climate Williams will cause meteorological disasters that will decimate vulnerable black neighborhoods . The warming of Earth will cause    such as Hurricane Katrina , to occur quite regularly . " " While climate change will affect everyone on this planet , marginalized groups will always be the ones who suffer the most , " he adds . " Environmental Williams , for that reason , are inherently black issues . " In the minds of Dominic A. Williams and other key critics of " environmental racism , " a person does n’t need to have race in mind to be a racist . If one ’s actions intentionally or unintentionally affect black people , they constitute racism . The black people thing is , these same authors are silent about a national disaster that does affect blacks far more than whites , actually causing a disproportionate number of black deaths and the decimation of the black population . This is the legally sanctioned practice of abortion . The rate of abortion among blacks is far higher than among whites , with 365 black babies aborted for every 1 , 000 that are born . While blacks account for roughly 38 % of all abortions in the country , they represent only 13 percent blacks account for roughly 38% of all abortions in the country the population , statistics that have led black Christian leaders to speak of a " black genocide " occurring at the hands of abortionists . In New York City , for instance , in recent years there were more abortions among black women in the city than there were New York City born . Both nationally and in New York City , the abortion New York City women are significantly higher than among any other demographic group . Now that is something for people of color to get angry about . Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter   Follow @tdwilliamsrome
