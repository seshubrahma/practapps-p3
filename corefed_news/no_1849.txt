Donald J. Trump ’s America flowered through the old union strongholds of the Midwest , along rivers and rail lines that once moved coal from southern Ohio and the hollows of West Virginia to the smelters of Pennsylvania . the hollows of West Virginia to the smelters of Pennsylvania flowed south along the Mississippi River , through the rural Iowa counties that gave Barack Obama more votes than any Democrat in decades , and to the Northeast , through a corner of Connecticut and deep into Maine . And the hollows of West Virginia to the smelters of Pennsylvania extended through the suburbs of Cleveland and Minneapolis , of Manchester , N. H. and the sprawl north of Tampa , Fla. where    white voters chose Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton . One of the biggest upsets in American political history was built on a coalition of white voters unlike that of any other previous Republican candidate , according to election results and interviews with voters and demographic experts . a coalition of white voters unlike that of any other previous Republican candidate just staunchly conservative Republicans in the South and West . They were joined by millions a coalition of white voters unlike that of any other previous Republican candidate voters in the onetime heartlands of    liberal populism   —    the Upper and Lower Midwest   —    where white Americans without a college degree voted decisively to reject the more diverse , educated and cosmopolitan Democratic Party of the 21st century , making Republicans the country ’s dominant political party at every level of government . Mr. Trump spoke to their aspirations and fears more directly than any Republican candidate in decades , attacking illegal immigrants and Muslims and promising early Wednesday to return " the forgotten men and women of our country " to the the country political forefront of American life . He electrified the country ’s white Mr. Trump and the country full strength against    demographic decay the country " A lot of stuff he ’s talking about is just    Mr. Trump sense , which I think both parties have lost , " said Tom Kirkpatrick , 51 , a Trump supporter who used to work in an industrial laundry plant and is now on disability . He stood near the Florida State Capitol Mr. Trump Tuesday , holding an American flag . " Let ’s put him in . And if he does Mr. Trump do what he says Mr. Trump I ’ll help you Mr. Trump him out . " But Mr. Trump Mr. Trump won over millions of Trump had once flocked to President Obama ’s promise of hope and change , and who on Tuesday saw in Mr. Trump their best chance Tuesday dampen the Trump blows of globalization and trade , to fight special interests , and to be heard and protected . Twelve percent of Mr. Trump ’s supporters approved of Mr. Obama , Trump exit polls . Mrs. Clinton President Obama a greater margin than Mr. Obama among affluent whites , particularly those living in the Democratic President Obama prosperous coastal strongholds : Washington and Boston , Seattle and New York . In Manhattan , where Mr. Trump lives and works   —    and where his fellow citizens mocked and jeered him as he voted on Tuesday   Mr. Trump    Mrs. Clinton won by Mr. Trump record Mr. Trump , amassing 87 percent of the vote to Mr. Trump ’s 10 percent . Around the country , she won a Mr. Trump voters over all , harvesting the country ’s growing Mrs. Clinton densely packed big cities and a plurality of the the country But Mr. Trump won    white voters to the Republican ticket , reversing a partisan Mr. Trump class lines that is as old as the Democratic and Republican Parties   —    a replay of the " Brexit " vote in June , when the old bastions of England ’s    voted decisively to leave the European Union . His breakthrough among white    voters in the North not only erased the Democratic advantage Mr. Trump reversed it , giving him a victory in the Electoral College while he lost the national popular His breakthrough among white   voters in the North . Mr. Trump strikingly , Mr. Trump won his biggest Mr. Trump among    white voters , according to exit polls Mr. Trump revolt not Mr. Trump of the white working class but of the country ’s vast white middle class . He did better than past Republicans in the sprawling suburbs along Florida ’s central coasts , Mr. Trump Mrs. Clinton ’s gains among Hispanic voters . He held down Mrs. Clinton ’s margins in the Philadelphia suburbs , defying expectations that Mrs. Mr. Trump would outperform Mr. Mrs. Clinton wide margin . Magnified by the constitutional design of the Electoral Mrs. Clinton and aided by    efforts to dampen black and Latino voting in states like North Carolina , Mr. Trump ’s America proved the larger on Election Day . It smashed through the Democrats’ supposed electoral " blue wall "   —    the 18 states carried by Democrats America every election since 1992 , such as Michigan and Pennsylvania , plus the diverse and    parts of the country that Mr. Obama attracted in his two races , like New Mexico , Nevada , Virginia and Colorado America Wednesday , you could walk from Mr. Obama Vermont border through Appalachian coal country to the outskirts of St. Louis without crossing a county Mr. Trump did not win decisively . You could head south through rural and suburban Georgia all the way to South Florida , or northwest through the Upper Midwest , or make a beeline for the West Coast , skirting only the rising Democratic communities of Colorado and the booming multicultural sprawl of Las Vegas before finally reaching Mrs. Clinton ’s part of the country . " It ’s not that he was the most polished of politicians , " said Justin Channell , 36 , of Brewer , Me . who works at a health insurance company . " I liked the message of the    that corruption in D. C. is so prevalent . " Mrs. Clinton won the America of big , racially diverse cities and centers of the new economy , from Silicon Valley Mrs. Clinton Silicon Slopes of Utah , where many traditionally Republican voters rejected Mr. Trump . But lining up for Mr. Trump was a parallel urban America of smaller cities   —    places like Scranton , Pa. Youngstown , Ohio and Mr. Trump Iowa   —    America boomed during the industrial era , and are still connected by the arteries of the old American economy . She had hoped for a surge of voting by Latinos , immigrants and    a manifestation of the rising American electorate long predicted by liberal strategists and feared by the Republican elite in Washington . But exit polls suggest that Mr. Trump   —    despite his attacks on immigrants , Muslims and Mexicans , and his clumsy invocation of black neighborhoods mired in chaos and decay   — Mr. Trump   did not fare worse among the    and Latino Mr. Trump   who showed up to the polls than Mitt Romney did four years ago . In    County , where Mr. Trump had more room to lose ground among Hispanic voters than anywhere else in the country , Mrs. Clinton inched up to only 64 percent from Mr. Obama ’s 62 percent of the Hispanic vote . Turnout dropped considerably in black communities across the country , from the rural South to Cleveland , Milwaukee and Detroit . By Wednesday , the notion of a Democratic electoral the country bolstered by rising Hispanic power seemed distant . Even if Mrs. Clinton had won Florida , Mr. Trump would have powered to victory through the new Republican heartland , in states like Pennsylvania , Wisconsin and Michigan , where Hispanic voters represent just a fraction of the electorate . Nor was the growing Hispanic vote   —    and Mrs. Clinton ’s strength among    voters   —    enough to pull her especially close in either Arizona or Texas , the only two heavily Hispanic states that could have plausibly joined Florida to put her Mrs. Clinton the top . Even where    Hispanics are growing as a force Florida Mr. Trump ’s supporters were waiting on Tuesday . Mrs. Clinton Brdar Trump stood in front of his West Tuesday polling station , holding a handmade " Vote Trump " sign , and waved a    of Mr. Obama ’s face made to Anthony Brdar like the Joker . It Mr. Trump a tyrant . Mr. Trump lawyer who lives in a Mr. Obama neighborhood in Miami , Mr. Brdar said he had never felt so compelled to vote . Anthony Brdar I feel our country is on the verge of the country third world country , " he said . " Mr. Brdar children are not going to have a future . We are not going to have a future . "
