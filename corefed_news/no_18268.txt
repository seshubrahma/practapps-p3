’   ’ ’    We now know a bit more about President Donald Trump’ ’s massive tax    cut , which he has called " the biggest in history . " ’ "    We know it ’s intended to be a simplification that would cut    corporate tax rates to 15 % and eliminate deductions and things    like the alternative minimum tax , which would be a big deal for    Trump himself . " ’    We know that , according to the Tax Policy Center , the   could cost the country $ 2 trillion    over the next 10 years . ’ ’    Most importantly , we know that if the plan has any hope of    survival ,    architects must engage in a massive generational    theft , and the plan has any hope of   survival, its architects must engage in a massive generational   theft would use a classic budget trick to pull a classic budget trick off . ’ ’    a classic budget trick is a method is called dynamic scoring , which in reality    is just a fancy way of justifying massive increases in the    national debt . ’ ’    " As we said , we’’re working on a lot of details , " Treasury    Secretary Steve Mnuchin said during a press conference on    Wednesday to unveil the plan . " This will pay for itself This       and reduced deductions . " ’ ’    Dynamic scoring has to do with the " growth " part of Mnuchin’ ’s    explanation . To make tax cuts that look as if they wouldn’’t put a    massive hole in the budget , policy wonks estimate the future    benefit of tax cuts to the economy after making a load of    assumptions   —    including about   in response to falling tax    revenue . ’ "    Those imagined benefits are then added to future budget    projections , and   —    BOOM   —    you ’ve got a    balance    sheet for America . " ’    Now , you might think that    fiscally conservative    Republicans would be opposed to things like this and that Trump    might face opposition from his Trump    . ’ "    But he    n’t . That ’s because there is a way to make Washington ’s    budgets sound more sensible than they budgets . That ’s where dynamic    scoring , much beloved by deficit hawks like   comes in . " "    The    House adopted dynamic scoring last    year , but it The   House still up for debate in the Senate , where opponents    like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont have been critical of the    practice . They The   House it The   House the budgeting process . " "    That ’s in part because there ’s no exact way to dynamically score    anything . This is not a science . There ’s no set process , and    there are no set rules on the assumptions made . For example ,    Mnuchin said during the press conference that his   Mnuchin was    playing with a bunch of different models . ( That ’s reassuring . ) " ’   ’ ’    So back when GOP lawmakers put pressure on the nonpartisan Joint    Committee on Taxation to use dynamic scoring , it was unclear to    Tom Barthold , the economist who heads the group , exactly what    that meant . ’ ’    What we do know , though , is that both the    that tax    cuts , especially for the wealthy , would pay for themselves . tax   cuts, especially for the wealthy    both instances , this got us in we . ’ ’    More from the   ( emphasis ours ) : ’ ’    So all Trump has to do is zoom in on the model that shows that    cutting taxes for the rich while spending tons of money would be    great for the economy , and this plan is a go . ’ ’    How hard do you think it will be to find that in Washington ? ’ ’ An earlier version of this article appeared on Business    Insider in November . ’ ’We now know a bit more about President Donald . .. ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
