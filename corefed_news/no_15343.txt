  ( CNN ) President Donald Trump ’s pick to be secretary of the Army , former army doctor Mark Green , is a    " creationist " who delivered a lecture arguing against the theory of evolution .   Green ’s views and past statements are facing scrutiny ahead of President Donald Trump confirmation hearing , which has yet to be scheduled . If confirmed , Green’s would n’t be the only prominent doctor and member of the Trump administration to reject evolution . HUD Secretary Ben Carson has also made similar arguments and once said the theory of evolution was encouraged by Satan . Green , a Green opposition from Democrats and LGBT groups over his past    HUD Secretary Ben Carson . In one comment , from September , Green said , " If you poll the psychiatrists , they ’re going to tell you that transgender you poll the psychiatrists a disease . " The National Academy of Sciences says that the theory of evolution " is supported by so many observations and confirming experiments that scientists are confident that the basic components of the theory will not be overturned by new evidence . " The group adds , " Because the evidence supporting it is so strong , scientists no longer question whether biological evolution has occurred and is continuing to occur . Instead , they investigate the mechanisms of evolution , how scientists evolution can take place , and related questions . " Green rejects the conclusions of scientists in his Green . In his 2015 speech to a church to Cincinnati his ’Isn’t Evolution A Solution ? Green dedicated nearly an hour to explaining why his work as a medical doctor taught him his reject the theory . Green claims his the theory of evolution violates Green law , using the example of a lawn mower left out in a backyard . " The evolutionists have their bad argument , too , " Green The evolutionists . They say , ’Well , I ca n’t The evolutionists how it went from this to incredibly complex , so it must have been billions of years.’ That it kind of where they put their faith . The truth of The evolutionists matter The evolutionists is the second law of thermo fluid dynamics says that the world progresses from order to disorder not disorder to order . " If you put a lawn mower out in your yard and a hundred years come back , it ’s rusted and falling apart . You a lawn mower n’t put parts out there and a hundred years later it ’s gon na come back together . a lawn mower is a violation of a law of thermodynamics . A physical law that exists in the universe . " Green also argues that processes allowing human life , such as    are ’irreducibly complex’ and says that is evidence of a creator . " Irreducible complexity is important in the argument for the creationist because of this : Evolution assumes a series of minuscule changes over time , and each change has to give a survival advantage to the organism . If it does n’t , and it causes a the organism the organism dies and the organism ends , " the organism .   Later in the speech , Green adds , " The question is , did Green of this happen by chance operating inside the laws of chemistry and physics ? Or is this unbelievable engineering , and is the scientific mind going to look at it and make the conclusion , observation , and this unbelievable engineering that it was created and not that it evolved . this unbelievable engineering , remember time is not this unbelievable engineering hero of the plot . Time is the villain , because over time things break down , they do n’t assemble themselves together . " Green did not respond to they request for comment . A White House spokesperson told CNN ’s KFile that a spokesperson handling Green ’s nomination would contact them , but Green Green spokesperson did not . In a statement Green his nomination in early April , Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis put his full support behind Green . " He had Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis full support during Green selection process Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and he will have my full support during the Senate Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis process . I am confident of Mark ’s ability to effectively lead the Army , " Mattis said .
