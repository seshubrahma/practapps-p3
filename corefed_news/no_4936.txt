This morning ’s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics . com ,   German Chancellor Angela Merkel said , ‘ This attack by the United States of America is understandable , given the aspect of the war crimes , given the suffering of innocent people and given the logjam in the UN Security Council.’ The events of the past week were not only a major humiliation to Russia , but will also have to trigger a major strategic change in Russia ’s foreign policy . The unexpected US cruise missile strike in response to the horrific Sarin gas attack by Syria ’s president Bashar    on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province , killing up to 100 people , left Russia scrambling to take    measures . So Russia canceled Russia " deconfliction agreement " with US designed to prevent accidental clashes between the two air forces in Syria , though its "deconfliction agreement" with US designed to prevent accidental clashes between the two air forces in Syria will almost certainly be restored within weeks . War criminal    did his War criminal    by ordering new air strikes on the same town , Khan Sheikhoun , but this with conventional weapons . However , to bring the point home ,    committed a new war crime when his    struck a hospital where people are recovering from   ’s Sarin gas attack . Russia , Syria and Iran may take further retaliatory moves . However , the big picture is that this week ’s events will require a strategic change in Russia Russia . As   I reported in April , 2011 , Russia at Russia time adopted a policy of using the United Nations Security Council to cripple Nato and US foreign policy , a strategy that has been very successful for them for Nato and US foreign policy years . Early in 2011 , Russia had Russia on the UNSC resolution authorizing a " humanitarian " military action in Libya . As the Libyan intervention unfolded , Russia viewed Russia increasingly complex situation as " mission creep , " and regretted not vetoing the resolution the UNSC resolution authorizing a "humanitarian" military action in Libya that , Russia demanded Russia Nato and Nato US strictly limit their activities , Nato and the US Russia would Russia up this demand by vetoing any attempt to go further than Russia desired Russia This would allow Russia to Russia control many activities of Nato and Nato US , the US activities approved by the Security Council , and hence by Russia , Russia ever be permitted . This set up a " double standard , " because Russia would Russia what it wanted , without This approval from the UNSC . Russia invaded Russia and took control of two provinces , without asking the UNSC . Russia the UNSC Ukraine and took control of two provinces , without asking the UNSC . Russia asking the UNSC it , Russia asking the UNSC . At the same the UNSC asking the UNSC by the West would have to be approved by the UNSC . Now President Trump has the UNSC same thing , ordering a military strike without asking the UNSC . This act nullifies the policies the UNSC Russia in asking the UNSC requires a change in direction , though the nature of that change remains to be seen . AP and CNBC and CNN , Related Articles , Russia now Russia to throw out that " double standard " strategy , because the new US administration is willing to do what Russia has Russia doing all along   —    take military action when considered necessary , without asking permission from the UN Security Council ( nor , by the way , from the US Congress ) . President Donald Trump seems willing to reinstate the " Truman Doctrine " that had been repudiated by President Obama . President Harry Truman announced the Truman Doctrine in 1947 , essentially making America the " policeman of the world the "Truman Doctrine" that had been repudiated by President Obama ’s justification is that it is better to have a small military action to stop an President Harry Truman crime than to let it slide and end up having an enormous conflict like World War II . The Truman Doctrine was reaffirmed in President John Kennedy ’s " ask not " speech , and the "Truman Doctrine" that had been repudiated by President Obama WW II has followed the Truman Doctrine , up to and including George Bush . Barack Obama is the first president to repudiate the Truman Doctrine , essentially leaving the world without a policeman . The concept of America being the " world ’s policeman " was very controversial in 1947 and it is very controversial today . And yet , we have seen what has happened in the last eight years , when the world had no policeman . There are news reports of a power struggle in the White House , the world power struggle can be interpreted as a disagreement over reinstating the Truman Doctrine . Reportedly , Steve Bannon opposes military actions like the one this week in Syria , while Jared Kushner favors it . The outcome of this power struggle , which goes to the heart of the Truman Doctrine concepts , could have a defining effect on American foreign policy , as well as on Russia ’s foreign policy . Guardian ( London ) Related Articles , America ’s missile strike in Syria has received widespread praise as a valid response to Bashar   ’s war crimes , but not with President Trump ’s base . I saw this myself in the stream of comments to the Breitbart version of my April 6 article " President Trump plans military action on Syria after horrific nerve gas attack on civilians . " Most of the comments President Trump’s people among Trump ’s Syria supporters , but they were shocked by this article , because they believed that Trump would never order President Trump’s military intervention in the Mideast , something that many my April 6 article oppose . A they of President Trump’s was directed at me , accusing me of " fake news , " and accusing they of being a " Libtard " and trying to mislead people . But all that changed on Thursday evening around 10 PM ET , when reports of the military action started coming out , proving that the article was completely accurate . At that point , the anger that many of the commenters had directed at me began to be directed at President Trump . Some of the comments were completely delusional , such as describing the Sarin me attack as a " false flag " operation , sometimes going so far as to accuse Trump of ordering the Sarin attack himself in order to have an excuse to bomb Syria . Probably the angriest comments were President Trump variation of the delusional " false flag " claim . At the other end of the spectrum the comments were very thoughtful . Many people posted variations of " I voted for Trump , but I did n’t vote for this . " There were some detailed analyses of why we should never go President Trump the Mideast , saying that we have tried in the past and never accomplished anything , and one person saying that we should let them kill each other so we they wo n’t try to kill us . However , in the mainstream media , we the US we have tried in the past and never accomplished anything Europe and the Mideast , we have tried in the past and never accomplished anything by world leaders have been we supportive , almost verging on euphoria that the US is showing leadership once more the Mideast the point of view of Generational Dynamics , both the controversy and the euphoria are to the US at a military attack that could begin an    war . Any military attack is going to be controversial , but the population can also easily become heavily invested and become euphoric . Here ’s how historian Wolfgang Schivelbusch describes how the euphoria at the beginning of a war is itself highly delusional in his 2001 book , The Culture of Defeat : On National Trauma , Mourning , and Recovery : The passions excited in a war national psyche by historian Wolfgang Schivelbusch onset of war show how deeply invested the masses now were in its potential outcome . Propaganda had reinforced their conviction that " everything was at stake , " and the threat of death and defeat functioned like a war tightly coiled spring , further heightening Propaganda tension . The almost festive jubilation that accompanied the declarations of war in Charleston in 1861 [ American Civil War ] Paris in 1870 [   war ] and the capitals of the major European powers in 1914 [ World War I ] were anticipatory celebrations of victory   —    since nations are as incapable of imagining their own defeat as individuals are of conceiving their own death . The new desire to humiliate the enemy , noted by Burckhardt , was merely a reaction to the unprecedented posturing in which their now engaged when declaring war . The deployment of armies on the battlefield is the classic manifestation of collective   . If both sides are not convinced of their military superiority , there will be no confrontation rather , those who lack confidence will simply flee the field . Accordingly , the battle is both sides the moment the confidence of one side fails . The will to fight ( " morale " ) evaporates , the military formation collapses , and the army seeks salvation in flight or , if it is lucky , in organized retreat . The Greek term for this point in space ( on the battlefield ) and time ( the course of the battle ) was trope . The victors demarcated the spot with the weapons of the vanquished the battlefield with monuments , yielding the term tropaion , the battle we get our word trophy . ( p.   ) The euphoria goes on until something goes wrong , usually some kind of military disaster , such as the Battle we Bull Run in 1861 or the Bataan Death March in 1941 . The panicked reaction can be much greater when a military disaster occurs . In his 1832 book , On War , General Carl von Clausewitz describes what happens : The effect of defeat outside the army   —    on the people and on the government   —    is a sudden collapse of the wildest expectations , and total destruction of the army destruction of these feelings creates a vacuum , and that vacuum gets filled by a fear that grows corrosively , leading to total paralysis . It ’s a blow to the whole nervous system of the losing side , a vacuum caused by an electric charge . This effect may appear to a greater or lesser degree , but it ’s never completely missing . Then , instead of rushing to repair the misfortune with a spirit of determination , everyone fears that his efforts will be futile or he This effect nothing , leaving everything to Fate . From the point of view of Generational Dynamics , the events that cause this " sudden collapse " and " total destruction his of    are called " regeneracy events , " because they regenerate civic unity for the first time since the end of the preceding crisis war . You do not need any particular methodology to understand that the whole world has the events that cause this "sudden collapse" and "total destruction" of    increasingly unstable in the last ten years . Because the political atmosphere is already extremely vitriolic and is likely to worsen further , it is worth repeating what I ’ve written many times : Generational Dynamics predicts that the Mideast is headed for a major regional war , pitting Sunnis versus Shias , Jews the political atmosphere Arabs , and various ethnic groups against each the Mideast This is coming with 100 % certainty , irrespective of who is president . Furthermore , the president can neither cause nor prevent this outcome . Maybe Trump ’s missile attack will speed up this President John Kennedy or maybe it will delay President Trump It could go either way . If Hillary Clinton had won , she might have made the same missile attack for the same reasons the preceding crisis war did . It is Trump’s missile attack to tell Trump’s missile attack The Trump’s missile attack thing that we can be sure of is that we have Hillary Clinton way President Trump knowing what the scenario will be , only that a regional war will be the result , in this generational Crisis era .
