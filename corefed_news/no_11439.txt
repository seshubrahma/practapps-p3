On Friday ’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel ’s " Special Report , " columnist Charles Krauthamer argued that Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s loss was because " Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s had nothing to say . Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s was running because it was Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s turn . "   Krauthammer said , [ relevant remarks begin around 7:30 ] " Well , look , every time liberals lose , liberals accuse the other side of all kinds of isms . That ’s been going on for 50 years , and at a certain point , liberals run out of steam . You can argue that , yes , there were times when Trump might have allowed sort of going beyond the bounds of what was   —    what is tolerable in political speech , but to attribute the loss to racism or an appeal to white supremacy , I think is ridiculous . Trump did n’t even show up in Wisconsin . Trump lost Wisconsin .    …      And in the end , the reason Trump lost is Trump had nothing to say . Trump was running because it was Trump turn . There was no way   —    remember from one of the internal messages that were leaked on WikiLeaks , someone said , what is our message ? This is from inside the campaign . So , I mean , Trump would like to blame This on the basket of deplorables . I do n’t think that that ’s going to hold up . Yes , you can launch a criticism of some of the things that were happening on the edges of the campaign , but it does not account for the outcome . " Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
