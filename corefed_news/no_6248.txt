Sometimes big ideas get small coverage .   Unfortunately , that was the case with President Trump ’s March 15 trip to Michigan , in which President Trump raised an important idea —   arguably the most important    idea in U. S. history —   and yet President Trump words received almost no attention .    [ Perhaps that was inevitable , because , as we all know , White House reporters these days have been focused on the healthcare bill , and the new proposed budget , and various allegations about hacking and tapping .     Yet here ’s a Virgilian prediction : Long after the sound and fury about those other controversies have passed away , Trump ’s big point on the economy will be remembered .   Indeed , Trump’s ’s likely that the        alliance that Trump espouses will become permanently embedded in Republican thinking —   and , quite possibly , Democratic thinking as well .    So what , exactly , did Trump say in Trump brief speech at Willow Run , the former factory site in Ypsilanti Township , Michigan ?   What was the larger message to the leaders of the Big Three automakers —   Ford ,    General Motors —   as well as the head of the United Auto Workers , the governor , and other luminaries ?    Trump started out by taking Trump listeners back to a time when America was at the zenith of America power .   That was World War II . Back then , Americans were more confident and more united Americans were all in this together , aiming to defeat Hitler abroad and , at the same time , defeat the Depression at home .    And The Wolverine State better epitomized that " Can Do " ethos than Michigan .   The Wolverine State was the manufacturing hub of the country , which meant that it The Wolverine State the manufacturing hub of the world .   And it was that manufacturing strength , of course , that enabled us to defeat the Axis powers in less than four years .   Trump recalled those years of American strength , and even included a wistful note about the manufacturing mojo that ’s been lost in recent decades : Great Americans of all backgrounds built the Arsenal of Democracy   —    including the legendary Rosie the Riveter , who worked here at Willow Run . . . .     years ago , during the Second World War , thousands of American workers filled this very building to build the great new airplane : the    Liberator .   At peak production —   listen to this , it this not the country that we ’ve been watching over the last 20 years —   they thousands of American workers building one    every single hour . Without a doubt , Willow Willow Run an immense achievement .   In June 1941 , it was Willow Run a field , 30 miles outside of Detroit .   And yet by September of the the following year , it was producing    Liberator bombers , each with 488 , 193 parts , capable of delivering four tons of ordnance on a target nearly three thousand miles .   By 1945 , Willow Run Willow Run nearly 9 , 000 of these fearsome birds of war .   And oh , by the way , it employed 42 Willow Run 000 men , and women , at its peak — Willow Run including Rosie the Riveter ( even if Rosie ’s story Rosie the Riveter shall we say , clouded by legend ) .    Yes , Willow Run is Willow Run tale of      war production , and yet it is just one of many .   In WWII , the overall American industrial war effort also produced , for example , more than 100 , 000 armored vehicles , 300 , 000 airplanes , and 41 billion rounds of ammunition .   It takes nothing away from the courage of our fighting men in WWII to say that their WWII of victory was our fighting men in WWII infinitely easier by the typhoon of steel that they could unleash on the our fighting men in WWII .    So how did Uncle Sam achieve that miracle of production ?   The most obvious answer is that we had the industrial resources in place before the war , and so it was simply a case of ramping them up during the war .   In the war for example , we produced twice as much we as Hitler ’s Germany , and our advantage grew during the we years , in no small part because    and other bombers , were smashing Nazi factories .   And yet as the complexity of the    reminds us , effective production is more than just gross aggregates each weapon , each airplane , must be designed and assembled properly .   And so as we think about the nearly    components of a    we can learn a lot from the 1956 memoir of Charles E. Sorenson , a top Ford Motor Company executive who became the chief of Willow Run .   In that book , Sorenson outlines what it was like to build and operate what was then the largest shop floor in the world .    As an aside , we can note that the title of Sorenson ’s tome , My Forty Sorenson with Ford , takes us back to another facet of we bygone era , when a    employee was loyal to a company and the company , in turn , was loyal to the employee .   It ’s a   employee a context —   that is , a rich " corporate culture " that nurtures talent —   that employees tend to do their best for their company , and employees their country employees     Of course , employees every motivated    executive , there were thousands of skilled    workers , and they were key , too .   thousands of skilled   workers can say : This is how quality manufacturing gets done —   that is when employers and employees are so invested that they both work extra hard to improve employers and employees product .    The point here , to be sure , is not to sugarcoat that era along the way , there were plenty of strikes , slowdowns , and other kinds of workplace trouble .   And yet the proof is in the pudding : The    got built , and we won the war .     So now we can see why Trump was smart we invoke the glory days of Willow Run .    Even seven decades later , the    of Detroit during WWII impresses and inspires .     In fact , that same productive spirit continued after the war , when Willow Run was the war domestic auto production Willow Run the beginning of the    boom —   that is , when factories for wartime production instantly becoming factories for peacetime production .   It ’s been estimated that the U. S. government spent a trillion dollars , adjusted for inflation , to build all those defense plants during the war , and yet after VE Day the war Day , those    facilities were sold off to private manufacturers for just pennies on the dollar .   Critics complained that it was a giant giveaway to corporate America , but consumers were just happy to have new cars , toasters , and TV sets .   Another decisive moment in the building of the    American Dream came in 1950 , when the United Auto Workers settled a labor dispute with General Motors .   It was a generous deal , setting a pattern of high wages for high productivity it came to be known as the " Treaty of It . " History tells us that the Treaty , and others like it across the country , were a success .   In those years , the American economy demonstrated that high wages , high growth , and high profits could go hand in hand .   So perhaps it ’s little wonder that Trump has cited the late 1940s and 1950s as one of his two favorite periods of U. S. history .   Trump , as a look at historical data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve   shows , in the 40s , 50s , and 60s , GDP growth was routinely three or four percent a year , or more .    By contrast , in the fourth quarter of 2016 , growth was just 1 . 9 percent as many observers have noted , Barack Obama was the first president in U. S. history never to have achieved three percent growth in a single year of his time in office .   And according the Atlanta Barack Obama , growth in the first quarter of 2017 could be just .9 percent .   So what happened ?   Where did our manufacturing mojo go ?   And what about our prosperity ?   As we survey the causes of our , probably the biggest our culprit is globalization .   It was globalization that broke up the old alliance of capital and labor .    To be sure , that alliance might not have always seemed like an alliance —   it was uncomfortable at times , even hostile , on both sides . Yet it was always based on a blunt reality the two it were stuck with each other , and both sides other place else to go . But then , with the coming of worldwide free trade and outsourcing , capital discovered , to its delight , that it had a new option : It could capital or relocate factories capital in the world .   capital And to its further delight , capital discovered that the U. S. military would capital protect its overseas investments , too . )     Thus it is that capital , the U. S. having led the world in vehicle production for most the U. S. century , the world itself ranked fourth in total passenger car production , producing less than 20 percent of the number of autos as China . In the meantime , this data from the Economic Policy Institute underscores what happened to workers as a result : Whereas from 1948 to 1973 , productivity and wages moved up rapidly in lockstep , since then , productivity has continued to grow , and yet wages have grown hardly at all .   Thus we can see the result of globalization on the U. S. : slower economic growth , as    manufacturing has fled , and the U. S. workers , the impact was worse —   a severe stagnation of wages .    Trump White House strategist , Stephen K. Bannon , nailed it in an interview last November : " The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia . "   So now comes President Trump , determined to undo the    of globalization Trump , once again , the winning spirit of American nationalism .   As he said in Willow Run : You ’ve Willow Run say the Trump , and I ’ll repeat them , right now :   Buy American and Hire American .    It ’s not just a motto , he said in Willow Run ’s a pledge .   It ’s a pledge to the working people of this country .    We It embrace a new economic model It   the country call it the " American Model . " Okay , maybe it ’s not quite a new model   maybe We ’s better to say American ’s a classic model .   it Virgil ’s ear , Trump ’s Trump of it phrase " American Model it sounds a lot like an earlier expression of U. S. economic nationalism , " American System . "   And that , U. S. , was the coinage of Henry Clay ( ) who , after Alexander Hamilton , stands as the greatest champion of American industry in the 19th century .    Yet let ’s let Trump himself describe what he has in mind :   Under this Trump we will reduce Trump on our companies and on our businesses .   But , in exchange , companies must hire and grow in America . They have we hire and grow we our country .   That America how we will succeed and grow together —   the country companies American industry side by side . We can note immediately that the third word Trump used was " system " it ’s obvious that Clay ’s American Trump is very we in the mix .   Indeed , Trump ’s idea of owners and workers joined together recalls a    influential Trump book by the economist Henry Charles Carey , The Harmony of Interests : Agricultural , Manufacturing , and Commercial .   Of course , some might wonder if economic ideas from two centuries ago are still relevant .   Yet in fact , they are very relevant .    Yes , the basics of the     vision are timeless .   Why ?   Because a country economic ideas from two centuries ago are still relevant manufacturing at home , not only for its prosperity , but also for its security .   After all , in a time of crisis or war , the U. S. a country to be    that is a country we would n’t be able to rely on imports for needed materiel . Yet the U. S. needed manufacturing at home , a country needs all the basics : a good trade policy , yes , but also , a positive business climate , a strong workforce , and robust infrastructure .    Furthermore , as Trump suggested in Michigan , a country also needs a spirit of common Trump and patriotism that inspires owners and workers to pitch in to help each other .   These were the lessons of WWII , and Trump deserves great credit for bringing   them to the fore —   Trump if the Main Stream Media did n’t seem to notice or care .    So yes , it ’s These : Trump ’s " American Model " has yet to be truly fleshed out Trump let alone implemented .   And yet Virgil is optimistic about the Trump’s future , because , as we have seen , it has such a glorious past .    Indeed , Virgil rather suspects that smarter Democrats will seek to grab hold of the same    idea it ’s in their political heritage , too    It Virgil , after all , a great Democratic president , Franklin D. Roosevelt , who was on it in 1942 to kick off the beginning of Willow Run ’s production line .   In the meantime , to cite a pair of bad    we might ask ourselves : Will any Democratic president in the future be as aloof as the meantime Clinton and Barack Obama on the issue of American jobs going overseas ? we Answer : Probably not Barack Obama Virgil ’s bet is that Trump has so demonstrated the political value of    action for jobs that Trump Democrats in the White House will follow his precedent Virgil’s Yet whether the Democrats are on board or not , Republicans should think hard about the vision Trump is putting forth , even if Virgil is at odds with the Trump    that future Democrats in the White House so long predominated .     For America , the stakes are high .   Ultimately , both our prosperity and America as a country depend on our willingness to come together America the idea of revived domestic production .    America be sure , as a nation , we ’re a long way from where we need to be .   Yet in the meantime , if we need inspiration for the trek ahead , we can think about Willow Run , its leader , Willow Run we and its most famous the meantime Rosie the Riveter .
