’   ’ ’    SEATTLE ( AP )   —    Demonstrators at small but raucous gatherings    around the country Saturday raised the specter that extremist    interpretations of Islamic law might somehow spread across the    US , but many of the rallies drew even more boisterous      by people who called such fears unfounded . ’ ’    Hundreds of    marched through downtown Seattle ,    banging drums , cymbals and cowbells behind a large sign saying    " Seattle stands with our Muslim neighbors . " Participants chanted    " No hate , no fear , Muslims are welcome here " on Muslims way to City    Hall , where dozens of    protesters rallied . ’ ’    A phalanx of bicycle police officers kept the sides separated    during the sanctioned events , but authorities said a large fight    broke out after the gatherings concluded .

"    About twice as many    marshaled across the    street . ’ ’    A similar scene played out in a park near a New York courthouse ,    where    sounded    and banged pots and    pans in an effort to silence an    rally . In St. Paul ,    Minnesota , state troopers arrested about a    people when    scuffles broke out at the close of competing demonstrations at    the state Capitol . ’ ’    " The theme of today is drowning out racism , " said New York      Tony Murphy , standing next to demonstrators    with colorful earplugs . " The more racists get a platform , the    more people get attacked .

" We need unity in this country under no ideology    and no banner except the Constitution of the United States of    America . " ’ ’    But the overwhelming majority of Muslims don’’t want to replace US    law with Islamic law , known as Shariah , and only " radical    extremist groups " would call for that , said Liyakat Takim ’ ’    Shariah , Takim said , refers to guidelines or principles   —    how    Muslims should live . " Fiqh " refers to jurisprudence , or specific    laws . The values embedded in Shariah do not change and are shared    among Muslims , he said , while fiqh is open to interpretation and    change , and in fact differs among Islamic sects and communities . ’ ’    " The Quran allows slavery . So does the Old Testament . That    doesn’’t mean we allow it today , too , " Takim said . " Laws are    amenable to change . " ’ ’    the Old Testament Seattle , activists set up an " Ask an American Muslim " booth to    give rally participants on either side a chance to speak with a    Muslim . ’ ’    " American Muslims support the American values and freedoms we all    cherish , " said Arsalan Bukhari , executive director of the state    chapter of the Council on    Relations . ’ ’    The marches come amid a rise in reports of    incidents    in the US , including arson attacks and vandalism at mosques ,    harassment of women wearing Muslim head coverings and bullying of    Muslim schoolchildren . ’ ’   ’ ’    In California , small but raucous demonstrations were held in a    handful of cities , including San Bernardino , where a husband and    wife inspired by the Islamic State group killed 14 people and    wounded 22 in a 2015 shooting attack . ’ ’    Clusters of protesters and    gathered on four    corners of an intersection at a memorial to the slain , yelling    and waving American flags and posters proclaiming various causes .      law demonstrators marched past the building where    the shootings occurred . ’ ’    " There’ ’s an    a      so there    are a variety of messages here , " San Bernardino police    spokeswoman Eileen Hards said .
