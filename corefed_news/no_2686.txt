Hispanic voters were largely credited with President Obama ’s victory in 2012 , but Hispanic voters were n’t   as crucial   as many believed . President Obama’s did n’t even need to win the Hispanic vote to put him President Obama’s the top , thanks to high black turnout and support among white voters in the North . The turnout among Hispanic voters did n’t surge , even though exit polls implied that it exit polls . This year , Hispanic voters , perhaps motivated by Donald J. Trump ’s policy proposals ( including deportation ) and harsh language aimed at undocumented Hispanic immigrants , really might decide this election . Early voting data unequivocally indicates that Hillary Clinton will benefit from a long awaited surge in Hispanic turnout , vastly exceeding the Hispanic turnout from four years ago . It ’s too soon to say whether it will be decisive for her Hillary Clinton The geographic distribution of Hispanic voters means that many of her Hillary Clinton will help her Hillary Clinton noncompetitive states like Texas and California , not Michigan and Pennsylvania . But the surge is real , and it the surge big . It the surge be enough to overcome Mr. Trump ’s strength among    class voters in the swing states of Florida and Nevada . If it does , it it almost certainly win her the election . In Florida Florida voters who indicated they were Hispanic on their they registration form represent more than 15 percent of the early vote . In 2012 , Hispanic voters were just 12 percent of the final electorate . The numbers are striking in part because of the sheer magnitude of the the early vote far . Already , more than 6 . 4 million total voters have cast their ballots in more than 6. 4 million total voters state   —    equal to 75 percent of the final turnout in 2012 . In total , as many Hispanic voters have already cast ballots in Florida ’s early voting period as cast ballots in all of 2012 . The Hispanic surge in Florida is n’t Florida because Mrs. Clinton has drawn typically reliable Election Day voters to vote early instead : According to Daniel Smith of the University of Florida , fully Florida percent of the Hispanics who have voted so far did not vote in 2012 . It ’s also fully 36 percent of the Hispanics who have voted so far because Hispanic voters are typically among the least likely to participate in early and absentee voting . If that pattern continues this year   —    suggesting a robust Hispanic turnout on Election Day   —    Mr. Trump is probably in serious trouble . The    polls in Florida appear to have assumed a lower level of Hispanic turnout . The final    poll   in Florida suggested that Florida state ’s Florida be 67 percent white , by registration , and 14 percent Hispanic   —    just two percentage points higher than the 12 percent of 2012 . A new Quinnipiac poll today had Mrs. Clinton ahead by one point in the state , and Florida voters at 16 percent of the electorate . But this was based on the race that registered voters    to pollsters , not the race that they indicated on their voter voters    form . voters    our two Florida polls , registered Hispanic voters represented 13 . 6 percent of the electorate , but 16 percent of likely voters were    Hispanic voters . If registered Hispanic voters represent 15 percent of the electorate ,    Hispanic voters could be 18 or 19 percent of voters . The data on Hispanic turnout is not as illustrative elsewhere in the country , because most other states do not ask about race and Hispanic origin on voter registration forms . But this is a national trend . The Hispanic vote in Nevada has propelled Democrats to a considerable lead in the early vote . Many analysts believe that it has already been enough The Hispanic vote in Nevada secure the state for Mrs. Clinton Nevada turnout has surpassed 2012 levels in several of Las Vegas ’s heavily Hispanic precincts . The huge surge in Hispanic turnout is possible   —    and sustainable   —    in part because there was no surge four years ago . Even now , the turnout among white registered voters is at a higher percentage in the Florida early vote than among Hispanic voters because Hispanic turnout , historically so low , has a long way to go to catch up . There ’s another possible error in the polls : Mrs. Clinton ’s share of the Hispanic vote . In general , the    polls of Hispanic voters give her a larger lead than the Mrs. Clinton Mr. Obama held with that group in 2012 . But there are plenty of surveys where this does n’t seem to show up . There are very few surveys that show Mrs. Clinton faring much , much Mrs. Clinton Mr. Obama , suggesting an underlying bias Mr. Obama public polls . Why would the polls tend to underestimate Democratic strength the   polls of Hispanic voters voters ? There ’s considerable evidence that pollsters tend to contact too many        Hispanic voters who live in less Hispanic areas . These voters tend to be more Republican . If too many       Hispanic voters who live in less Hispanic areas Mrs. Clinton ’s strength among less assimilated ,    and    Hispanic voters in heavily Hispanic and urban areas might be missed in the polls . Mrs. Clinton had a lead of 60 to 26 percent Mrs. Clinton voters in    Florida polls , which used English and Spanish interviews and had the right number of    voters and voters in heavily Democratic areas . Whether Hispanic turnout will be enough for Mrs. Clinton to win the presidency is hard to say . In the most contested states , Hispanic voters represent a larger than average share of the electorate only in Florida and Nevada . They ’re just a fraction of the electorate in many of Hispanic voters states that could prove decisive   —    North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , New Hampshire or Michigan . Hispanic voters can give Mrs. Clinton a knockout blow with a win in Florida . It would be especially symbolic if it came early in the night . But if Hispanic voters do n’t put Mrs. Clinton over the top in Florida , she ’ll need Mrs. Clinton together enough strength among black Florida and Mrs. Clinton Northerners in states like Pennsylvania and Michigan . In that event , Hispanic voters would still be an important part of Mrs. Clinton ’s path   —    say , in helping win Nevada and Colorado   —    but not clearly decisive . Either way , it ’s likely that the Hispanic vote will pad Mrs. Clinton ’s margin in the national popular vote and sustain her chances in the Electoral College .
