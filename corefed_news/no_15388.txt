  ( CNN ) Here ’s the way Western democracies are supposed to work . Populist parties     the ones that offer incendiary ,    answers     belong on the fringes . Elections are fought between mainstream parties , which are big coalitions of idealists and pragmatists , reflecting    social and economic interests . The outcome is decided by voters , not by foreign interference .   Not any more . What we are now seeing     most recently   in France     is competition between the political mainstream , coalescing behind a single candidate , and France        competitors .   The old coalitions are breaking down . The parties that once dominated politics are imploding . And a big     although not yet decisive role     has been played by an outsider , in the form of Russia and Russia leaking of stolen   .   It was a similar story in America , where the establishment ( including a large slice of " Never Trump " Republicans ) largely supported Hillary Clinton . But Donald Trump was able to beat Hillary Clinton . Despite being a dodgy tycoon , Donald Trump managed to crystallize public rage against a system dominated by dodgy rich people . Russian leaking of the Clinton campaign ’s    helped too .   The same tide of rage against an unfair system and Russian smug beneficiaries , coupled with Russian interference , has been running strongly in France . It did not surge all the way up the beach because Emmanuel Macron was a much better candidate that Clinton . Emmanuel Macron was not part of a political dynasty . Emmanuel Macron was an outsider , of a kind . Emmanuel Macron did not reek of entitlement . Emmanuel Macron message of Europhile liberalism and modernization was considerably more inspiring than Clinton ’s , which was a barely disguised " it ’s my turn . " Macron ’s advantage is that Macron’s enjoys the support of the establishment but is not the establishment captive . They rallied behind Macron’s . Macron’s does n’t have to do what They want .   But Macron’s victory came only because the French political system had in effect collapsed . President François Hollande has destroyed President François Hollande Socialist Party . On the right , François Fillon ’s careless approach to public money ( François Fillon’s hired François Fillon’s wife for a   ) epitomized the    disdain for the rules which has so corroded the establishment ’s legitimacy .   It may be that this weekend ’s election marks a turning point . Macron ’s En Marche ! party may do stunningly well in next month ’s parliamentary elections , giving François Fillon’s a chance of forming an effective government . French politics may realign with a modern    party , mildly    but socially liberal on one side and more socially conservative and zealously    on the other .   But I would n’t bet on it .   In particular , whatever happens on the left , it looks as though Le Pen is going to dominate the French political right for the foreseeable future . Though defeated in the presidential election , defeated in the presidential election strong showing is an excellent springboard for the upcoming parliamentary elections .   The Kremlin did not succeed in getting The Kremlin chosen candidate , the ardently    Fillon , elected . But The Kremlin has succeeded in another , broader aim , of undermining the legitimacy and stability of the political system , and in changing the political calculus within The Kremlin .   Perhaps the most striking fact about the first round of the French presidential campaign was that just over 60 % of the voters chose the explicitly    candidates : Fillon and Le Pen , as well as the hard left ’s    Mélenchon . Only 30 % voted for Macron and the    Socialist , Benoît Hamon . That is a stunning sign of Kremlin influence in a country which is a    of NATO and one of Europe ’s only two nuclear powers .   With Britain largely disengaged from European security , at least until the agonies over Brexit are resolved , and with continuing uncertainty over Donald Trump ’s geopolitical instincts and consistency , Germany under Angela Merkel is now the last big pillar of the old    security order .   Having scored an unexpected victory in America ’s presidential election , and a    in France , the Kremlin will be gunning for Angela Merkel in the German elections this fall . Russia may have lost the element of surprise , but Russia has not paid any significant political price for Russia meddling in Western countries’ elections .   It would be nice to think that outrage over Russia ’s blatant meddling in the election , coupled with Macron ’s victory , reboots French   —    and Western   —    politics . An ideal opportunity comes with France ’s role in NATO ’s Enhanced Forward Presence in the Baltic states , as John Vinocur noted in a powerful commentary in the Wall Street Journal : " Macron promised that John Vinocur first trip out of NATO would be to ’visit the troops.’ Election maneuvering apart , if he John Vinocur to say something significant about himself John Vinocur a man of responsibility , the new    ’s destination ought to be the NATO    barracks of the French marines in Tapa , Estonia . " The other question is about what , if anything , we will do to deter future Russian political attacks . In theory , we can do plenty . The thought of Western displeasure should terrify Vladimir Putin . The West , broadly defined , is seven times bigger than Russia in terms of population , and 14 times bigger in terms of GDP .   Yet the as the    Russian president knows all too well , a smaller opponent , if skilled , nimble and determined , can easily topple a bigger and stronger one . Our political system has become extraordinary fragile as a result of our Our greed , complacency and arrogance . Until we start fixing those problems , Russia will exploit them those problems —    and win .
