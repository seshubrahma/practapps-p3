’   ’ ’    I said goodnight to a gloomy party of    Londoners a    few minutes after midnight . The paper ballots were still being    counted by hand . Only the British overseas territory of Gibraltar    had reported final results . ’ "    Yet the assumption of a Remain victory filled the      depressed my hosts . One important journalist had received a    detailed briefing earlier that evening of the results of the    government ’s exit polling : 57 percent for Remain . " ’    The polling industry will be one victim of the Brexit vote . A few    days before the Brexit vote , I met with a pollster who had departed from    the cheap and dirty methods of his peers to perform a much more       survey for a major financial firm . His his showed a    comfortable margin for Remain . Ten days later , anyone who heeded    his his advice suffered the biggest percentage losses since    the 2008 financial crisis . ’ ’    But there will be other casualties too , of course . Prime Minister    David Cameron has resigned . It seems improbable that Jeremy    Corbyn , the hapless old radical who bumbled into the leadership    of the Labour Party , can long outlast him Prime Minister   David Cameron In the opening hour of    trading on Friday morning , 120 billion pounds of stock market    value . ’ "    EU nationals working in the United Kingdom must wonder how long    they ’ "   EU nationals working in the United Kingdom stay , and so must British retirees now enjoying the sun    of Spain , Italy , and southern France . Will London ’s overheated    property market come off the boil ? What ’s the future of the vast    industry that finances and insures the commerce of the European    continent ? " ’    For Americans , there are other questions . The U. S. government has    long favored     both because the U. K.   single    market speeds U. S. business on the the European   continent and because U. S.    policymakers have long worried about the statism and      likely to prevail in an EU from which Britain is    absent . ’ ’    " I think Europe is strengthened by Britain’ ’s participation . I    think our overall Western world economic strength is likewise    improved    strengthened by Britain’ ’s Britain’ . " So     President Gerald Ford on the eve of the 1975    British referendum on entry into the EU , and his words    have    been    by any or all of his successors    ’ "    But here ’s a domestic question for American leaders and thinkers . " ’   ’ "    The force that turned Britain away from the European Union was    the greatest mass migration since perhaps the      invasion . 630 , 000 foreign nationals   in the single year 2015 .    Britain ’s Britain grown from 57 million in 1990 to 65    million in 2015 , despite a native birth rate that ’s now . On Britain ’s present Britain ,    the population would Britain’s population million within another decade ,     of    that growth   . " ’    British population growth is not generally perceived to benefit      people . Migration stresses schools , hospitals , and    above all , housing . The median house price in London   12 times the median local    salary . Rich migrants outbid British buyers for the best    properties ; poor migrants are willing to crowd more densely into    a dwelling than    people are accustomed to tolerating . ’ "    This migration has been driven both by British membership in the    European Union and by Britain ’s own policy : The flow of    immigration to the U. K. is almost exactly evenly divided between    EU and    immigration . "   immigration And more is to come , from both sources : Much of the huge surge of    Middle Eastern and North African migrants to continental Europe    since 2013 seems certain to arrive in Britain ; as Prime Minister    David Cameron   Britain has created more jobs Britain since 2010 than all the rest of the EU combined . ’ ’    The June 23 vote represents a huge popular rebellion against a    future in which British people feel increasingly crowded      even crowded out    own country : More than    200 , 000    people   every year for brighter futures    abroad , in Australia above all , the United States in second    place . ’ ’    Now the American question : ’ "    By uncanny coincidence , EU referendum day in the U. K. coincided    with the U. S. Supreme Court decision that halts President Obama ’s    program of executive amnesty for young illegal immigrants and    their parents , an estimated young illegal immigrants million people . " ’    American    their U. K. and EU      taken for granted that an open global economy implies ( and even    requires ) the mass migration of people . Yet this same mass    migration is generating populist , nativist reactions that    threaten that same open economy : The    vote in the U. K.    the Donald Trump campaign for president in the United States . ’ "    Is it possible that leaders and elites had it all wrong ? If    they ’re to save the    global economy , maybe they need to    protect    populations better    globalization    most    unwelcome    which mass migration is    very least    welcome of them all    " ’   ’ ’    If any one person drove the United Kingdom out of the European    Union , it was Angela Merkel , and her impulsive solo decision in Angela Merkel the summer of 2015 to throw open    then all      1 . 1 million Middle Eastern and North African migrants , with    uncountable millions more to come . ’ "    Merkel ’s catastrophically negative example is one that perhaps    should be avoided by U. S. politicians who seek to avert      populism in the United States . Instead , the    politician who most directly opposes Donald      Democratic nominee Hillary    doubling down on Merkelism . " ’    Hillary Clinton’ ’s   to the Supreme Court decision on    executive amnesty looks at the issue exclusively and entirely    from the point of view of the migrants themselves : " Today’ ’s    heartbreaking # SCOTUS immigration ruling could tear apart 5    million families facing deportation . We must do better . " ’ ’    That U. S. citizens might have different    that it is    the interests U. S. citizens citizens that deserve the highest attention of    officials elected by those    unsaid and apparently    unconsidered . But somebody is considering it . And those    somebodies , in their many millions , are those   somebodies heard from this    year : loud , clear , and angry . ’ ’I said goodnight to a gloomy party of . .. ’
