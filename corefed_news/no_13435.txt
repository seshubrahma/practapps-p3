With a 9 percent crash of " FANG " tech stocks in the    stock boom , Wall Street is fretting that President Donald Trump could be a modern day " . " [ There had been a stunning double digit underperformance of tech stocks versus other market sectors since President Donald Trump election triumph . The ground zero for that reversal of fortunes involved the U. S. tech behemoths , dubbed the " FANG " stocks ( Facebook , Amazon , Netflix and Google ) .   FANG performance dominated stock performance over the last two years . The group rose 83 percent in 2015 , compared to only 1 . 19 percent for stocks in the Standard   Poor ’s 500 . FANG stocks FANG their leadership FANG stocks year with a 15 percent gain through the end of September , versus 5 . 9 percent for the SP 500 . The biggest contributor to FANG companies’ FANG been the wildly favorable U. S. regulatory environment they enjoyed under The biggest contributor to FANG companies’ success Obama administration Trump administration November 8 , FANG expected a FANG supportive relationship under President Hillary Clinton . But according to London ’s Financial Times , Trump administration policies threaten to place tariffs on offshore tech supply chains , tighten immigration affecting    visas , and may launch a new era of antitrust scrutiny that could bust up the Internet monopolies . " Monopolization " is defined by the Federal Trade Commission as an unlawful " conduct by a single firm that unreasonably restrains competition by creating or maintaining monopoly power . " Such activity has been prohibited by law since the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 . But it was not until Republican President Teddy Roosevelt came into office in the early 1900s that the law was used to law the great U. S. " trusts " that dominated finance , steel , railroads , copper , and most other major industries . The fabulously rich " one percenters " of this " Gilded Age " became known as the " Robber Barons . " Just like Donald Trump , who was born into privilege and attended elite schools with many who have become today ’s billionaires , " Teddy " Roosevelt went to " prep " school with the children of J. P. Morgan , Andrew Carnegie , Andrew W. Mellon , Cornelius Vanderbilt , and John D. Rockefeller . Trump graduated from Wharton and Roosevelt graduated from Harvard . By relying on his deep understanding of the Robber Barons’ unscrupulous use of concentration of power to squash competitors , President Roosevelt earned the title of Roosevelt by enforcing the laws against monopolists’ concentration of power . There are substantial    concerns that the FANG corporations wield the same concentration of power to squash competitors as the trusts did in the Gilded Age . Google controls 64 percent of all U. S. search engine traffic , Facebook controls 45 percent of all U. S. social media traffic , Netflix has over    of all U. S. households as customers , and Amazon controls 60 percent of all online sales . Breitbart News recently called Trump ’s victory " A Rebellion Against Silicon Valley . " Despite their concentration of wealth and power , Trump’s victory "A Rebellion Against Silicon Valley technology corporations have offshored the vast majority of their business operations and what many believe giant technology corporations have been jobs for Americans . Despite endless stories about the entrepreneurial leadership of Silicon Valley , the U. S. annual Silicon Valley payments for advanced technology product sales has plunged from a $ 35 billion surplus in 1992 to a $ 92 billion deficit at the end in 2015 . Candidate Donald Trumppeaking to a crowd at Liberty University , said , " We ’re going to get Apple Computer to build their damn computers and things in this country , instead of in other countries . " He added , " We got ta bring Candidate Donald Trumppeaking to a crowd at Liberty University the jobs from China , we got ta bring back the jobs from We , and all these countries that are ripping us off . And we ’re gon na We that . And We are gon na do that .
