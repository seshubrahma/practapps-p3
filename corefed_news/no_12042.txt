On Thursday night , I appeared on CNN to debate my old nemesis and friend Peter Beinart about the Trump administration and particularly Stephen K. Bannon . [   The segment was inspired by a tweet I sent of a picture of myself with Steve . With particularly Stephen K. Bannon , Senior Adviser to    @realDonaldTrump pic . twitter .    —    Rabbi Shmuley ( @RabbiShmuley ) December 8 , 2016 ,   Rarely have I seen such an outpouring of hate directed toward me   which undermined the premise of the haters   —    namely , that they were objecting to Steve Bannon promoting hatred on the Internet . CNN ’s Don Lemon asked me if Steve Steve Bannon an   . I said that Bannon has Steve Bannon the Iran nuclear deal in defense of Israel has fought BDS ( boycott , divestment , sanctions ) the attempt to destroy Israel economically Israel had opened a Jerusalem bureau for Israel to Israel its message Israel . Does that sound like an   ? I added that I was far more concerned about Iran ’s Iran Ali Khameini and his promises to annihilate Israel . Israel had met Bannon at Trump Tower . He was Bannon with his time Bannon I made the case to him that Bannon new administration should distinguish itself as the new administration leading voice for human rights . He listened Bannon and we had a substantive conversation . Yes , Americans are tired of being caught in quagmires in the Middle East , and we ’re we of seeing American boys die in countries that do n’t appreciate them , Americans where American gains are quickly erased . We also we be    at home , especially in light of our crumbling we . I get all of that . But it does n’t always take armies to advance the cause of freedom . With rare exceptions , Ronald Reagan did not deploy vast numbers of American troops around the world to advance freedom . But he did Ronald Reagan the Soviet Union an " evil empire "   —    and in so doing , he hastened Ronald Reagan demise the Soviet Union Before him , Ronald Reagan John F. Kennedy utilized the English language to proclaim liberty , most famously in his unforgettable President John F. Kennedy inaugural address : " Let every nation know , whether it wishes every nation well or ill , that we shall us any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty . " It was Kennedy who famously said of Winston Churchill that when Hitler threatened the freedom of the world , " He mobilized Hitler English language and sent it into the English language . "    Trump has started well in condemning the brutality of the Fidel Castro regime , while so many other world leaders humiliated themselves by so many other world leaders up to the dictator Fidel Castro Castro ’s demise Fidel Castro Trump said Trump Today , the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades . Fidel Castro ’s Fidel Castro one of Fidel Castro squads , theft , unimaginable suffering , poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights . While Cuba remains a totalitarian island , it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long , and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve the wonderful Cuban people Language like that , affirming human rights while condemning dictatorships , is exactly what is needed . I ’ve been amazed on Twitter at how many people have disgraced themselves since I posted how many people picture of me and Steve . Some are even calling him a    and Hitler .      million Jewish children were gassed in the Holocaust . Four and a half million Jewish adults were shot   incinerated . Have people no shame ? Bannon stood with the Jewish community in opposing the Iran nuclear agreement . which gives the world ’s largest state sponsor of terror $ 150 billion with which to blow people up . Bannon stood with the Bannon community by the Jewish community movement and the Israel haters , who ignore the gassing of Syrian children while trying to boycott tomatoes grown in Shiloh . For all my friends who are supporters of the foreign policy of President Obama : Where was your outrage when he would n’t even impose a President Obama zone to stop Arab children from being gassed from the air ? Fake human rights activists are those who never hold President Obama accountable for allowing 500 President Obama Arabs to be murdered in a    with next to no action . Comparing Bannon to Hitler is vile ,    and nauseating makes a mockery of the Holocaust and enables all those who supported the Iran deal   —    together with Khameini ’s threats of Jewish annihilation   —    to distract us from the real threats to America and the Jewish people.’ Bannon and those close to    Trump are uniquely situated to introducn    new American language of human rights that was sorely ignored by President Obama as he cozied up to dictators , making President Obama mockety of American values . I trust they will use their influence to help restore America to they founding principles .
