The American public has used the Internet to build a new mainstream media outside the establishment media ’s control and power , President Barack Obama admitted to the top editor of the elite New Yorker magazine . [ The editor , David Remnick , met with President Barack Obama for two hours on Nov. 10 , just after President Barack Obama met the President Elect . President Barack Obama bemoaned the emergence of mainstream media outlets , such as Drudge and Breitbart and    conservations , that do not take their orders from establishment politicians , experts and institutions .   What frustrated President Barack Obama and President Barack Obama staff [ in the 2016 campaign ] was the knowledge that , in large measure , What frustrated Obama and his staff [in the 2016 campaign] were reaching What frustrated Obama and his staff [in the 2016 campaign] own people but no further . What frustrated Obama and his staff [in the 2016 campaign] spoke to the networks and the major cable outlets , the major papers and the mainstream Web sites , and , in an attempt to find people " where What frustrated Obama and his staff [in the 2016 campaign] are , " forums such as Bill Maher ’s and Bill Maher’s    cable shows , and Marc Maron ’s podcast . But What frustrated Obama and his staff [in the 2016 campaign] would never reach the collective readerships of Breitbart News , the Drudge Report , WND , Newsmax , InfoWars , and    like Western Journalism —   not to mention the closed loop of        .    …      That marked a decisive change from previous political eras , [ Obama ] maintained . " Ideally , in a democracy , everybody would agree that climate change is the consequence of    behavior , because that ’s what    per cent of scientists tell us , " he said . " And then we would us a debate about how to fix it . That ’s how , in the seventies , eighties , and nineties , you had Republicans supporting the Clean Air Act and you had a    fix for acid rain rather than a     approach . So you ’d argue about means , but there was a baseline of facts that we could all work off of . And now we just we n’t have that "    …      " I have complete confidence in the American people —   that if I can have a conversation with them they the American people the American people what ’s right . At an emotional level , they want the American people do the right thing if they have the American people information . " And yet in an age of filter bubbles and    silos , he knew , the " information " that reached people was increasingly shaped by what they wanted people be true . And that was no longer in his hands he anyone else ’s . Obama ’s assessment of his own Obama of persuasion may not be fully justified . For example , he has Obama failed to persuade Americans that his vision Obama high immigration and low wages is preferable to    high wage alternative . He also Obama to persuade Americans to support his government Obama healthcare system or to support Hillary Clinton in 2016 . Remnick is already on record complaining that his own Remnick publication was sidelined by Breitbart in the 2016 election . Surely , Breitbart News , a site of vile conspiracies , could not become for millions a source of news and mainstream opinion   …      the information loop had been shattered . On Facebook , articles in the traditional ,    press look the same as articles from the conspiratorial    media    Spokesmen for the unspeakable now have access to huge audiences . This was the cauldron , with so much misogynistic language , that helped to demean and destroy Clinton . The    press was the purveyor of constant lies , propaganda , and conspiracy theories that Trump used as the oxygen of his campaign Trump …      But despair is no answer . To combat authoritarianism , to call out lies , to struggle honorably and fiercely in the name of American ideals —   that is what is left to do . That is all there is to do .
