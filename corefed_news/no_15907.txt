  ( CNN ) President Donald Trump released a    financial disclosure form Friday , detailing the broad outlines of President Donald Trump wealth but still leaving a number of unanswered questions about the specifics of not only Trump ’s income but also the details of President Donald Trump vast holdings . In short , President Donald Trump financial disclosure is nice . His President Donald Trump returns     which he President Donald Trump the first presidential candidate in four decades to refuse to release     would be far better . Trump President Donald Trump filed the disclosure forms with the Office of Government Ethics on Friday . He President Donald Trump not required to file the forms , which cover his President Donald Trump over the past 15 and a half months , until next spring . ( Past presidents including Barack Obama and George W. Bush have also released them Past presidents including Barack Obama and George W. Bush , according to the Washington Post . ) Trump President Donald Trump wealth , as documented in the report , is vast . He Trump’s in hundreds of millions of dollars in income over the past 15 months while carrying liabilities north of $ 300 million . ( The the Washington Post that Trump President Donald Trump are worth at least $ 1 . 4 billion . ) Trump raked President Donald Trump $ 288 million from his golf President Donald Trump alone he made President Donald Trump least $ 37 million from     his Florida President Donald Trump and a frequent weekend stomping ground for the first family . The big problem with financial disclosure forms is that they only require financial disclosure forms of assets and liability     making it extremely difficult to get an accurate sense of what Trump true ’s wealth is . For example , consider these two paragraphs on Trump ’s loans from the CNN story by Cristina Alesci and Jill Disis : " Overall , Trump reported liabilities Trump’s at least $ 311 million     mortgages and loans . But the number could be much higher because he was required Trump’s to report a range in value for each loan . " " Of the 16 loans he reported , Trump’s were worth more than $ 50 million each one is worth between $ 25 million and $ 50 million and seven were worth between $ 5 million and $ 25 million apiece . Another three loans combined were worth less than $ 1 million . " There is also the fact that , unlike a tax return , these financial disclosure forms do n’t require Trump to detail how much he paid in Trump , the profits and losses from his various businesses Trump whether he has any Trump in foreign companies and whether ( and how much ) he has donated Trump charity . ( Read this great Jeanne Sahadi piece for a comprehensive look at what tax returns tell you that financial disclosures do n’t . ) All of which makes the rhetoric coming from Trump and his top aides Trump his level of Trump about his finances misleading Trump In February 2016 , Trump tweeted this Trump " Just for your info , tax returns have 0 to do    someone ’s net worth . I have already filed my financial statements    FEC . They are great ! "   He has repeated Trump line whenever he has been Trump about his income tax Trump since that time . Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in April that " the president has released plenty of information and has given more financial disclosure than anybody else , " adding : " I think the American population has plenty of information on his taxes . the president That is n’t accurate . But you can bet that Trump ’s decision to voluntarily file his financial disclosure Trump months ahead of time will become a new talking point for Trump and his Trump whenever Trump questions regarding his taxes inevitably Trump . The key point to remember : Financial disclosures are simply no substitute for tax returns when it comes to understanding someone ’s financial standing and various commitments . Think of it this way . You go to a baseball game . Financial disclosure forms are like sitting near the top of the upper deck . You can see a baseball game is going on but it ’s tough to a baseball game out the individual players or figure out what pitch the pitcher is throwing . Tax returns are like having    seats behind home plate .   You can see the reaction on the batter ’s face when he disagrees with a call . You can see how the teams interact     both with each other and amongst themselves . You can the teams the pop of the fastball hitting the catcher ’s mitt . It ’s an entirely the pop of the fastball hitting the catcher’s mitt game and experience . Right now , the American public is sitting way up in the rafters of Trump Financial Stadium . You have a vague sense of what ’s going on . But unless and until he releases his tax he     he : He probably wo n’t he     we ’ll all be squinting to try to figure out exactly what we ’re looking at we
