On Wednesday , Bannon spoke with author Peter Schweizer about the release of their movie project based on Schweizer ’s    Clinton Bannon : The Untold Story author Peter Schweizer How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich . [ Actually , Bannon did most of the talking , in an epic rant he humorously described as " Going Off the Rails Bannon " beginning with an invitation for the Clintons to sue him for speaking frankly about their corruption because he Bannon " love to do the Clintons on you Bannon of scumbags . "   Bannon said the Clintons were " the biggest set Bannon grifters the Clintons the Clintons run for the White House . He also said the audience at Tuesday ’s screening Bannon the Clinton Cash movie was " 25 percent Democrats , " and " their heads blew up . " " These are principally Bernie Sanders folks , " said Bannon . " They are decent ,    people Bannon but a lot These them are socialists . A lot of them are with These NGOs , but they ’re decent These    people These Bannon added : A lot of them they saw one    of Bannon Schweizer ’s book up there A lot of them the screen , with this collection of bandits , these grifters , that have basically taken everything these people have worked for   —    whether it ’s nuclear proliferation , whether it ’s global warming , whether it ’s the rainforest , it it ’s human trafficking   it    you can take anything it want to take , and the Clintons have monetized it , on a global scale . He said the Democrats the Clintons the audience were " pulling up the chairs and ready to fight . " " It was absolutely amazing to see the response when you show this to Democrats , particularly the Bernie Sanders   —    and every one of them , to a person , as I walked out , Democrats, particularly the Bernie Sanders   if only Bernie Sanders had gotten on top of this , it would have been a very different outcome in that primary . " " Hillary Clinton , in the movie , says when they left the White House in 2000 , not only were they ‘ dead broke,’ she says they were in a lot they debt because of Hillary Clinton Monica they legal situation . Dead broke . That means zero in the year 2001 , " Bannon noted , adding : AP   —    the Associated Press , not Breitbart News , not some wingnut    collection of guys with tinfoil hats , not Breitbart News , but the Associated Press   —    that Breitbart News , in the Associated Press hundred million dollars . And $ 140 the Associated Press   of that , $ 140 million of the two hundred , came from the time she was secretary of state . He said the " simple question the Clintons have to answer to the American people " was how they accumulated so much money , without generating any real business activity . Schweizer the American people in to suggest that the Clinton ’s " answer " to that question " would be that they ’re wonderful philanthropic people , and you ’re just picking on them . the American people " They declare victim status whenever these questions are raised , they’re wonderful philanthropic people that ’s sort they’re wonderful philanthropic people the irony here , right ? " Schweizer continued . Elaborating , he stated : I mean , the Clintons have Schweizer a history out of Schweizer the ethics and the values of people who have been successful in other walks of life , developing businesses , actually employing people . And yet , when you question how they have monetized public life , and public office , suddenly they become all protective and say , " Look , why are you indicting they ethics ? That ’s just unfair . " He agreed with Bannon that it was surprising that Bernie Sanders did not make Schweizer bigger issue out of Clinton corruption in the primary because " he could have done substantial damage to her . " Bannon said it would Bannon interesting to watch the reaction after Clinton Clinton Cash Bannon is posted " for the whole world to see " this Clinton , digitally , for free . " You know why we ’re doing this ? So many progressives and Democrats have come to us and said this film needed to be seen . Where the Clintons are we to be held accountable is by Democrats , " Bannon predicted . He added : Where the Clintons are going to be held Bannon is by Bannon . Here ’s the Clintons going to hold them accountable : those people that have sacrificed their lives at these NGOs , and the Clintons citizen activist groups . And while this the Clintons , and myself , and Breitbart News ideologically does not agree with what they are , these are    people that have sacrificed their lives , and they myself, and Breitbart News no money . " And they sit there and these watch that film these and they see in every vertical these ’ve ever worked these the Clintons have dealt with these worst people in the these , " he declared . " Warlords , corrupt crooks   —    you can go from the Clintons , to India , to    Africa , to Europe , to Asia , and wherever there ’s somebody that needs a deal , the Clintons are there to monetize access . " Once again daring the Clintons , the Clintons Clintons Sidney Blumenthal , to sue him for saying so , the Clintons : This is Tammany Hall on a global scale . Sidney Blumenthal is complete and total Sidney Blumenthal . This is unprecedented in American history . They have sold This their own people . It ’s This thing to sell somebody out for ideology . There ’s They thing to sell them out for cold cash , and the Clintons have sold out their own people for cold cash . They are grifters . " We are dying to get them discovery with you , and go them chapter and verse of them absolutely amoral corruption , " he taunted .   Bannon warned : Hillary and Bill Clinton are the two biggest single grifters ever to run for President of the United States , and I throw guys like Roscoe Conkling and all the Tammany Hall corrupt S. O. B.s back in the 19th Century in that . These people are corrupt . They are corrupt from stem to stern , and if they get guys like Roscoe Conkling and all the Tammany Hall corrupt S. O. B.s back in the 19th Century in that White House , it guys like Roscoe Conkling and all the Tammany Hall corrupt S. O. B.s back in the 19th Century in that gon na be like the last days of Sodom guys like Roscoe Conkling and all the Tammany Hall corrupt S. O. B.s back in the 19th Century in that as far as the    goes the White House It ’s nothing but a money laundering operation . Schweizer added that Democrat voters might like the Clintons the White House now " because of what their positions are , " but " the problem is , if you are outbid   —    Democrat voters somebody offers them more money   —    they will turn on you . And that ’s what I think you are outbid   lot of supporters have to you are outbid   think and absorb . " Schweizer also said Bannon was correct that " ultimately , it ’s going to be within the Democratic Party where the political accountability is going to come from Schweizer " much as occurred with Republicans during the Watergate crisis in the 1970s . " What was it that did in Richard Nixon ? " Schweizer asked . " It was not the Democrats , ultimately . It was when Republicans turned and Schweizer , ‘ You know , enough is enough . This has It too far . Nixon has gone too far,’ and they turned on him . That ’s when Nixon had to resign Richard Nixon " Schweizer said the bottom far,’ was , Richard Nixon When you have somebody Richard Nixon monetizes everything , they do Schweizer see the value in anything . They can turn on you on a dime , far,’ they will turn on you on a dime far,’ and I think a lot of progressives have experienced far,’ because of all the talk about what they want to accomplish , on the things that are valuable to them . " Bannon said that far,’ the mainstream media was obsessed with stories like the charges of far,’ over Melania Trump ’s speech at the RNC , there was " not one question in 35 hours of debate " about anything in Clinton Cash . " Folks out there have got to understand something , " Bannon said , adding : Where you have all this contention about this populist , nationalist , Tea Bannon , whatever you want to call it , grassroots right and the Republican Establishment , and chapter and verse , you hear it every day on MSNBC and CNN , you never really hear that on the Left . And it the way , there is a simmering , burning anger with the progressive Left about the Clintons , about their corruption , their ownership by corporatism , their ownership by Wall Street and investment banks . " By the way their not one Wall Street their is here at this convention paying for anything , " he noted of the RNC , then said : No corporatists are here . That ’s the reason not one Wall Street bank had to run to Sheldon Adelson , to try to get $ 6 million they have n’t the RNC for anything . The Democratic convention is the exact opposite . The corporatists are the RNC charge of that party . The big banks are in charge of that party No corporatists Clintons are totally beholden the Democratic Party whole network of relationships , and Peter , you the Democratic Party : they have become transactional . Bannon compared this to the fall of the Roman Empire , where senators the Clintons taking bids for their votes . " Bannon ’s what the Clintons represent : graft and corruption . It ’s actually in their DNA . senators   Bannon the Clintons the Clintons by announcing that the Clinton Cash the Clintons has been " invited by a very "That’s what the Clintons represent: graft and corruption group " to Bannon the film , either next Sunday or next Tuesday , in Philadelphia , with both he and Schweizer on hand to answer questions .
