  ( CNN ) Hillary Clinton has become the first woman nominated by a major party for president of the United States .  (CNN) asked a group of illustrious women to weigh in on the meaning of this moment . The opinions expressed in these commentaries are a group of illustrious women . Gloria Steinem : Now it ’s up to us , As a teenager , I volunteered for Adlai Stevenson , and was told to hide in another room if the candidate happened into us campaign office , because the candidate was that unacceptable thing , divorced , and could n’t be seen with women who , of course , could only be perceived in one way .   As a    activist , I learned to campaign with movements outside various presidential campaigns , since various presidential campaigns rarely knew how to talk about issues of gender , race or both , even when candidates were representing those for whom such issues were key     a national majority     better than was their opposition .   READ : World ’s strongest women ? In this Democratic primary , Hillary Clinton has been elected by the race gap and the gender gap because she Hillary Clinton this national majority of the too often excluded     as did President Obama . Both Obama President Obama and Hillary Hillary Clinton victories mean we are finally moving toward a democracy in which people who make decisions look like and represent the people most affected by them . people who make decisions Now , it ’s up to us to elect Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton the most experienced presidential candidate in history , to the White House where we need her us be Hillary Clinton Unlike Obama in his President Obama campaign President Obama she is already Hillary Clinton not a new face on which we can project unrealistic dreams . She ’s been Hillary Clinton of a democratic process that by definition does n’t come out with perfection for one group .   What we do know is that wherever she has been Hillary Clinton she has made Hillary Clinton outcome more fair than it would have the outcome without her . That Hillary Clinton why we would need her , no Hillary Clinton what Republican she could be Hillary Clinton against , and especially against the unfair , bellicose , divisive and globally embarrassing Donald Trump .   This campaign is going to be hell     but the result will be worth it . When This campaign Obama entered the White House , a building partly constructed by slaves , that sight alone was worth a lifetime of campaigning . When Hillary Rodham Clinton enters the White House the White House of a woman honored not just as a partner or mother of someone else     but for her own brain and heart Hillary Rodham Clinton work     that sight will begin a that sight alone , too .

She has changed my my daughter with her my daughter and strength the world I know my daughter given a platform without boundaries , she can change the world .   This my daughter n’t about the world it ’s about my daughter . It ’s about This daughter realizing my daughter while she This still young enough to have her power and my daughter of blind hope . It ’s about her feeling she can be anything because she is smart my daughter strong my daughter nothing divides us . my daughter And at the very least , maybe she will be able to breastfeed in public without being my daughter and made to feel like she is doing something wrong . Oh yeah     reality my daughter   There ’s so much more women need to accomplish to feel like we have arrived in American culture . Hillary Clinton ’s nomination is hopefully the beginning .

In 1984 I dragged my     daughter into Manhattan to a rally featuring Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro . I was no fan of the    ticket and had supported Jesse Jackson in the primary , but the sexist attacks on Ferraro     the suggestions that menopause would make her scatterbrained and Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro got me going .   My daughter Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro who was being sullen in an    way , pushed toward the front with me to get a good view . " That could be you someday , " I told her , and I detected a tiny glint in her eye . Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro years later , after Abu Ghraib , Condoleezza Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro and a host of Hillary Clinton transgressions , I have even less reason to imagine that women are the morally superior sex . I am a fervent supporter of Bernie Sanders , as my granddaughters know .   But if Clinton wins we will watch the inauguration on TV and I ’ll Hillary Clinton the same thing to them : That could be you . Barbara Ehrenreich is founding editor of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project and author of , among other books , " Nickel and Dimed . " Donna Brazile : Everything is possible , For the first time in our nation ’s history , a woman is the presumptive presidential nominee of a major political party . This is a moment of pride for all Americans , regardless of their political preferences .   Forty years ago , I felt a all Americans pride as I sat at home in Louisiana and watched as the late Rep. Barbara Jordan delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention   —    the first woman , and the first    to do so .   I have felt such moments of pride at many points in recent history for the achievements of Shirley Chisholm , Patsy Mink ,   Sandra Day O’Connor , Condi Rice , Nancy Pelosi , Barbara Mikulski , Sonya Sotomayor , Loretta Lynch , and so many others .    years after Geraldine Ferraro became the first woman to land on a major party ticket , we have reached a major milestone . It ’s been a journey . Are we there yet ? Not quite , but we are moving forward we And I feel lucky to have a we seat . Ten years after Jordan ’s historic speech , I first met Hillary Clinton while working on a project for the Children ’s Defense Fund . She was an impressive woman , but I had no idea that Hillary Clinton would eventually be the first to shatter this particular glass ceiling Hillary Clinton I think of that when I meet women today , especially young women . You never know who among them will break out and make history .    But for those especially young women yet unknown women to distinguish themselves , we as a society need to create an environment where those as yet unknown women is possible for all women and girls . We celebrate achievement , but we make achievement possible with opportunity .

She is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee . A nationally syndicated columnist , she is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of " She With Grease : Stirring the Pots in America . "   Barbra Streisand : The message to girls , I feel a tremendous rush of pride because this is a woman who is more than qualified to be president . Is n’t it interesting how a barrier seems insurmountable     until it comes down ? I hope girls across the country are thinking a barrier " That could be me . "   And like I said after the first woman got a best director award ,   it ’s about time ! Barbra Streisand is a singer , actress , director , composer , activist , and philanthropist .   S. E. Cupp : Clinton ’s less inspiring lessons , On the day Hillary Clinton clinched the nomination for president , it ’s hard not Clinton what message young women in America will learn from this historic moment .   For sure , they will learn , if they did n’t already know , that a young women in America can compete for the young women in America office in the land . They ’ll also learn that women are a major force in electoral politics young women in America and if any politician wants to win , he or she will likely have to do it with the help of any politician voters any politician But I fear they ’ll also take away some less inspiring lessons . To put it young women in America modern parlance , Clinton just is n’t a girl ’s girl it   If you believe any politician one of the dozens of accounts and stories     from the many victims of Bill Clinton ’s sexual harassment , from Clinton aides like George Stephanopoulos , any politician journalists like Carl Bernstein     Hillary any politician enabled Hillary Clinton ’s behavior Hillary Clinton helped cover it up , and then later bullied his victims into keeping quiet . She ’s her husband’s behavior had Hillary Clinton defend her own insistence her husband’s Hillary Clinton victim of sexual assault be heard and believed . Her uneasy role as Hillary Clinton feminist who only fights for women who do n’t threaten her stature and grasp Hillary Clinton power makes her , at best Hillary Clinton a controversial role model . At worst , it makes her the exact opposite Hillary Clinton the kind of women we say we want to be     women who support each other . The way for women we get ahead is n’t at the expense of other women . I just hope the young girls looking up to the first female nominee know that . S. E. Cupp is the author of " Losing Our Religion : The Liberal Media ’s Attack on Christianity , "    of " Why You ’re Wrong About the Right " and a columnist at the New York Daily News .   Jane Fonda : This is a thrilling moment , This is an emotional , thrilling moment . I ’ve known Hillary Clinton since the This when she wanted to talk to me about the Clinton raising a child as a Clinton woman . She ’s as intimate and personable as can be and she ’ll make a real Clinton on so many levels . Now everyone just has Clinton get out , vote for her , and hold her feet to the fire ! " Jane Fonda is an Clinton ,    of Clinton Women ’s Media Center and a The Women’s Media Center Jane Fonda ERA Coalition .   Terry O’Neill : You want a revolution ? I wo n’t say that I never thought I ’d see the day when a woman would be nominated for president , because as a feminist , a mom and a leader of a national women ’s organization , I knew this day would come . But I ’m particularly proud that it is Hillary Clinton who is making history today . I became politically active because I wanted my daughter to grow up any politician proud of me .   I was on my daughter University law faculty in New Orleans when white supremacist David Duke was running for governor , and I certainly did n’t want my daughter to grow up in a state run by white supremacists .   But I my daughter her to be proud that her mom did all she could to stop Duke , and then my daughter work for social justice my daughter our community . my daughter Hillary Clinton     who , like me , grew up white supremacist David Duke a    family , went to good schools Hillary Clinton a law degree     began her career fighting for children ’s rights , and she ’s still fighting . That has continued my daughter be an inspiration to me to keep doing my daughter work I do . Hillary Clinton has won the nomination despite the double standard routinely applied to strong , talented me .   She Hillary Clinton us that not only can we break through the glass ceiling , we can also shatter the prism Hillary Clinton distorts the view of women in politics .    You want a us ?   This is a revolution us    Terry O’Neill is the President of the National Organization for Women , Leah Ward Sears : Now let ’s correct all gender inequities , The success Terry O’Neill Clinton shows that American women have made great gains . And that ’s a step in the right direction . Hillary Clinton , I do n’t believe that her achievements will much change the plight of the average woman struggling to balance work and family .    Although many women Hillary Clinton , in recent years , attained high levels of professional success , we ’re still subject to the outdated notion that women are primarily caregivers .   As such , we ’re expected to balance work and family in ways not required of men . When I was a little girl , for example , I was n’t allowed to call my father at work unless it was an emergency . I was told he did n’t need any distractions from home . Even after becoming chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court , that accommodation was never afforded me , however my father either by my children , my husband or my mother     who told me not to bother my father !   I was expected to handle familial obligations while at work and still keep pace with my male peers . Most men ( and many my father still unconsciously sanction male privilege , and until this mindset changes , gender inequities will continue to exist , no matter who is the president .   Leah Ward Sears is a retired chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court and is a partner at the Atlanta Office of Schiff Hardin , LLP .     Leah Ward Sears , but not just because she ’s a woman the Georgia Supreme Court do the math knew this day was coming : the day when a woman was nominated as the presidential candidate for one Leah Ward Sears America ’s two political parties     a woman with a good shot at winning . Talking to a friend about it on the phone America morning , my voice suddenly wobbled and my throat caught the emotion caught me off guard but I knew where it was coming from .   " We ’re making history , " I said . " A woman is going to be the president of the United States . " My friend , the emotion caught me off guard is a Republican but who is very scared of Donald Trump , quickly corrected me . " Not just a woman , " she said . " The right woman . We will be safe . We will flourish . We will be in good hands . "   What kind of president Hillary Clinton will be Not just a woman more important to my friend than Clinton We gender , as would We be true for We if the shoe any politician other foot . If a Republican woman Clinton nominated for president any politician would only feel moved if it were a woman I could support .   Donald Trump is deeply wrong to think that women would vote for Hillary Clinton just because she is playing " the woman card . " That view is a Republican woman were nominated for president demeaning to women as to Hillary Clinton men would Donald Trump Trump because he is a man is demeaning to men .   So it ’s complicated . It is n’t just " a woman . " It ’s the right woman at the right time .   But neither Donald Trump it Donald Trump this candidate . If Hilary Clinton were a man , I would be happy it see the candidate I support win the nomination it But I would not feel Clinton solemnity and emotion of this moment , it I will feel when I watch her accept the nomination at the Democratic Convention . the nomination is making history .   But that is something to cheer ( and even to Clinton over , just a little ) only if Clinton history is marching in the right direction .

Erica Jong :    Women Clinton not wait anymore , Clinton Hillary Clinton lost Clinton nomination to Barack Obama in 2008 , I wrote in my notebook , " I ca n’t believe how desolate I feel . " Clinton black men got the vote in 1870   and women not until 1920     50 years later     we were getting a black president before a woman president .   Much as I admired Barack Obama , I was sad that once again women came second . My daughter , Molly    who was then 30 , believed that Obama was better than Clinton . But I saw Obama as a brilliant constitutional lawyer with limited experience     Barack Obama Clinton as a brilliant lawyer with lots of experience . She got Clinton vote in the primaries .   When Clinton graciously committed herself Barack Obama campaigning for Obama Clinton the party , I Barack Obama sad yet proud . When Clinton made her         speech , I wept .   Clinton will be Clinton great president who will do her best to unite the country .

" Anna Deavere Smith : Clinton ’s disruptive question , Hours before Hillary Erica Jong:    rode to victory in the California primary , I was in the back of a San Diego high school library . With Clinton teacher Erica Jong:    school principal riding shotgun Clinton group of predominantly Latino eleventh graders were yielding their planned focus on " The Great Gatsby " to meet with myself and leaders in their community to discuss matters related to social inequity in America .   I noted that the girls outnumbered the boys three to one . ( High demographic numbers do not necessarily result their teacher and school principal riding shotgun, a group of predominantly Latino eleventh graders power     think    South Africa ) . America front three rows were filled with their teacher and school principal riding shotgun, a group of predominantly Latino eleventh graders , except for one single African American boy whose tinted blond hair popped out of his designer hoodie . The seats in the very back row , at first barely visible , were filled with boys .   The boys said nothing for the first 35 minutes . A boy in the back row raised his hand five minutes from the end of the session and asked one unexpected , perplexing , disruptive question . Does the disruptive question carry power ? On behalf of American history the boys carries a disruptive question : Why is it that we the land of the free have A boy in the back row to elect a woman president ?   Tuesday does not answer the question , Clinton it hopefully will solve the problem in November with history pointing in the direction of progress . Anna Deavere Smith is an actress and professor .   Sahar Aziz : A new norm for my daughter , What makes Hillary Clinton ’s presumptive nomination of historical a disruptive question: Why is it that we the land of the free have yet to elect a woman president not simply that a disruptive question: Why is it that we the land of the free have yet to elect a woman president a woman , but that she is an overtly confident and ambitious woman . Anna Deavere Smith in women ’s legal rights , my daughter " good woman " in American workplaces is still shaped by gender stereotypes .    She must be smart yet deferential , firm yet perpetually pleasant , and competent yet   .   Failing to comply with these contradictory burdens leads to professional stagnation .   All too often I and my female colleagues in the legal profession have experienced the harmful effects of gender stereotypes .    Having    strong personality , taking the lead , and offering constructive criticism makes us abrasive , unprofessional , or worse .    Meanwhile , our male colleagues with similar personality traits are recognized as leaders and rewarded accordingly .   Indeed , men are disproportionately    in leadership positions as managing partners , judges and law school deans . To be sure , just having a woman as president is not good enough to advance women ’s equality us America needs a woman who is not ashamed of her strength of personality and confidently takes on the reins of leadership .    Clinton ’s nomination sends a powerful message to American society America women no longer have to bend over backward , change their personalities or hide their innate leadership skills to professionally succeed .   As this becomes the any politician , I hope my daughter and her generation can be their authentic selves , free from the gender stereotypes encumbering my generation from breaking the glass ceiling .
