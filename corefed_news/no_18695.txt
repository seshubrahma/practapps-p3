" Here ’s a truth partisans are not supposed to admit : Whether the president is a Democrat or Republican , America usually remains more or less the same place . " ’Policy changes matter , and therefore ’Policy changes matters who wins elections.’ ’But the institutions that underlie our government and society matter more than which party steers those institutions at a given time.’ " Because of this truth , there are more important things than which party wins a presidential election . Leaders who threaten to undermine those fundamental institutions   —    even if those fundamental institutions   are within your own party   —    are worse than normal politicians from which party . But that ’s a damaging admission that    politicians really prefer not to have to make . " ’The campaign of Donald Trump is like an experiment   —    seeing whether a GOP candidate can be so manifestly threatening to the institutions that prevent American society from falling apart that he will a GOP candidate Republican officials to admit that there are worse outcomes than electing Hillary Clinton.’ " That breaking point has n’t arrived yet for most Republicans . " ’Marco Rubio , for example , has called Trump an " erratic individual " and a " con artist " who " is wholly unprepared to be president of the United States " and " has no ideas of any substance on the important issues . " But despite all that , he says ’Marco Rubio he’ ’s standing by a pledge to support Trump if Trump ’s he’ ’So this week , Trump has Trump up the test . Will normal Republican officials continue to insist that a candidate whose supporters have committed repeated acts of violence , and who defends by his staff Trump they allegedly normal Republican officials so , make for a less horrifying president than Hillary Clinton?’ ’’ " On Tuesday , Trump ’s Trump allegedly roughly grabbed the arm of Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields and yanked her away from Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields as she Trump a Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields , leaving her with bruises Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields according to Fields and . " ’The Trump campaign responded Trump a   and   even though Politico obtained an apparently .’ ’On Wednesday , an attendee apparently   a protester who was being escorted out of a Trump rally . Trump police proceeded to detain the man who had been punched , only arresting the alleged perpetrator after the assault got news coverage . The alleged attacker ,     John McGraw , told Inside Edition that he enjoyed " The alleged attacker,    John McGraw the hell out of that big mouth " and " next time we see him , we The alleged attacker,    John McGraw have we kill him . " The alleged attacker,    John McGraw ’Obviously , Trump did not instruct McGraw to commit John McGraw . But at a rally last month ,   that he’’d like to punch a protester in the face , like you could in the " good old days " when such a protester would " be carried out on a stretcher . " And at another rally last month ,   to " knock the crap out of " any protesters who brought tomatoes to throw , saying that he’’d pay the legal fees of anyone who did so.’ ’Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks released a statement saying only that " we are not involved . " Trump surrogate Andy Dean   —    a former contestant on " The Apprentice , " of course   —     that the punch was " impressive " for a     and looked like " good exercise . " ’ ’Trump has created a campaign culture that joyfully celebrates violence . From the attacks against protesters , to threatening to kill the families of terrorists , to insisting the military will commit war crimes if he instructs them to do war crimes , he is explicitly he the institution of the rule of law that underlies American happiness and prosperity.’ " This should be scarier than a president who wo n’t repeal Obamacare . " ’It is not literally impossible to conceive a Republican candidate too horrible for Republicans to endorse . In 1991 , when    leader David Duke was the Republican nominee for governor of Louisiana , Republicans all the way up to President George H. W. Bush endorsed his opponent , President George H. W. Bush was not only a Democrat but widely considered to be corrupt.’ ’"Vote for the crook , it’ ’s important " went the slogan for supporting Edwin Edwards over Duke , and it worked . it’ still won Duke solid majority of white voters , despite the Republican establishment falling away from him , but Duke lost the Duke ’So this is a question that needs to be put repeatedly to    Republicans : Has Trump reached David Duke levels Duke ? How about now ? What about now?’ " It was the last question at last week ’s debate , and it deserves to be asked again tonight of Rubio , Ted Cruz , and John Kasich : After what we ’ve seen this week , do you really still stand by your pledge to support this man for president ? " " Here ’s a truth partisans are not supposed to . .. "
