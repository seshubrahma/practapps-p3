The campaign of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is speaking out to defend American war veteran and Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) Council President Chris Crane . Over the weekend , Sen. Marco Rubio demeaned Crane , who ’s critical of Sen. Rubio ’s involvement in the Gang of Eight bill . [ " This courageous ICE officer —   a man that Sen. Jeff Sessions has called Council President Chris Crane an American hero’   …      has served "This courageous ICE officer —  a man that Sen. Jeff Sessions has called ‘an American hero’  …      country in so many different capacities : in the Marine ’s uniform , as an ICE officer , [ and ] as a representative for all of America ’s ICE officers , " said Donald Trump ’s Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller on Breitbart News Sunday .   Rubio has repeatedly made clear " where Rubio priorities are " on immigration , Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller on Breitbart News said —    explaining that there are now three lanes dividing the GOP Presidential field : the Governor ’s lane , occupied by John Kasich the frontrunner ’s lane , occupied by Donald Trump and the " amnesty lane , " which is occupied " solely and exclusively " by Rubio . Prior to joining the Trump Donald Trump , Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller on Breitbart News served as Jeff Sessions’ communications director . On Friday , Breitbart News published an exclusive interview with Chris Crane , an ICE officer of 13 years and a U. S. Marine , in which Crane said Sen. Rubio law enforcement " like absolute trash " during his push Rubio pass his 2013 Rubio bill . On Saturday , Rubio appeared Rubio Fox News Breitbart News denounced Crane and his Crane Rubio the country . " He ’s Rubio an ICE official , he ’s Rubio of a union , " Rubio said Rubio . Miller , who worked for Sen. Sessions as Rubio sought Rubio push the Gang of Eight amnesty bill through the Senate , explained that : " Chris Crane was a central figure in stopping the Gang of Eight immigration bill from becoming law . He did that "Chris Crane was a central figure in stopping the Gang of Eight immigration bill from becoming law his capacity as "Chris Crane was a central figure in stopping the Gang of Eight immigration bill from becoming law ICE Council President for America ’s nearly 6 , 000 ICE officers and personnel . What that means is that the 6 , 000 ICE officers and personnel cast a ballot to pick one from among their own ranks the 6, 000 ICE officers and personnel represent them     … the 6, 000 ICE officers and personnel He [ Crane ] was a central figure in exposing the Gang of Eight bill and stopping it . " Miller explained that rather than rebutting ICE officer Crane ’s specific accusations , Rubio responded by attacking Crane ’s integrity rebutting ICE officer Crane Crane made specific rebutting ICE officer Crane claims [ about Sen. Rubio ’s amnesty bill ] Rubio So Rubio can either say one Rubio two things on substance . He can either say : Rubio 1 ) ‘ No , Chris Crane is wrong the rebutting ICE officer Crane fabulous , it Sen. Rubio’s amnesty bill passed exactly as is.’ Sen. Rubio’s amnesty bill ( 2 ) [ Rubio could say , ] ‘ Rubio ’s right we should have rebutting ICE officer Crane to him.’ Instead he [ Rubio ] went for option him.’ Rubio which is to attack the integrity and decency and morality not just   …      [ of ] Chris Crane —    who again rebutting ICE officer Crane has called ‘ an American hero’ —    but to attack , by extension , all of the ICE officers for whom he speaks . Miller detailed how Crane has Miller himself " over and over " again to Miller " a man of courage and honor . " Providing listeners with a better understanding of the American veteran Sen. Rubio chose to demean on national television , Miller said : I want to explain just Miller little bit more about why Chris Crane is such an exceptional person . Crane situation he finds himself in : he represents America Miller ICE Miller , who Miller in a political environment in this Homeland Security Department under Obama where they are ordered every day to violate their oath where they face unceasing pressure from the they chain of they to release criminal aliens and violent people back on the streets and have nothing they can do   …      And Chris Crane they 2012 spoke out , when precious few did , about President Obama ’s first executive amnesty . And he Obama other ICE officers courageously filed a lawsuit Obama stop President Obama ’s 2012 executive amnesty . Think about the courage that takes about how it affects your future career , in terms of how it affects possible political reprisal . Again , Chris Crane it proven over and over that he is Chris Crane of courage and honor and decency . Chris Crane for Marco Rubio to lump him in this group of conspiracy theorists , I just find Marco Rubio   …      Historically , I do n’t think attacking law enforcement has been a path to the Republican nomination . Miller confirmed Crane ’s account of how Sen. Rubio oversaw as Crane was Chris Crane the Gang of Eight Marco Rubio conference for Chris Crane to ask a question on behalf of the nation ’s law enforcement . Miller explained that this was " a moment in which the character of Miller Rubio was revealed " : I was there at the press conference Marco Rubio were others   …      where Marco Rubio allowed Eight’s press conference be ejected for asking a question at the Marco Rubio   …      That ’s one of those moments when the measure of a man is determined   …      All of us in our own lives have a moment when we ’re tested —   where the world figures out us we are and what we are us made of   …       That was a moment in us the character of us Rubio was revealed . He was standing on the stage [ next to ] Chuck Schumer . This courageous ICE officer the character of Marco Rubio   a man that Sen. Jeff Sessions has called ‘ an American hero’ —    who has served his country in so many different capacities : in the Marine ’s uniform , as an ICE the character of Marco Rubio , [ and ] as a representative for all of America ’s ICE officers . He tried to ask a question , Marco Rubio locked eyes with him . And when they the character of Marco Rubio to forcibly remove that ICE officer from the press conference , Marco Rubio had a chance —   a moment to stand up and do the right thing — Marco Rubio and he did n’t do it . And now having had that fact and many other exposed , Marco Rubio is attacking the a chance of a United States Marine and an ICE officer , who everyday Marco Rubio this nation safe . And I hope that Sen. Rubio issues an apology to Chris Crane and to Breitbart News . Rubio ’s treatment of Marco Rubio and his implicit denunciation of Crane " really has become one of Marco Rubio issues of the 2016 race , Marco Rubio Miller said . Chris Crane explained that Rubio ’s attack of Crane seems to suggest that Rubio wishes the Gang Marco Rubio Eight bill Marco Rubio passed : Marco Rubio an interesting paradox Chris Crane everybody . Just think Marco Rubio this for a second   …      Rubio ’s tone suggests that he ’s mad at Chris Crane . Ok , well Chris Crane helped stop the Marco Rubio Eight bill . But Marco Rubio Rubio therefore saying Chris Crane wishes Crane had n’t stopped Chris Crane , so it the Gang of Eight bill That Marco Rubio the implication , Marco Rubio ? What he Chris Crane saying by implication is : ‘ We Eight bill been better off Eight bill a country had Chris Crane not Marco Rubio out because then obviously it would have been much easier to pass the Gang of Eight bill.’ So he Chris Crane of caught in a little paradox here because the more he attacks Chris Crane for speaking out , Marco Rubio more he ’s saying that he would really have liked to have Marco Rubio is for the Gang Chris Crane bill to pass Marco Rubio become law . Marco Rubio asked if there was anything Sen. Rubio has done to indicate that he now takes law enforcement seriously , Miller gave a review of Rubio ’s record : The Gang of Eight bill had the following provisions in it : it legalized Sen. Rubio offenders , it legalized gang members Sen. Rubio it legalized criminal convicts Rubio it legalized child the Gang of Eight bill with multiple criminal convictions . Chris Crane and other the Gang of Eight bill officers the Gang of Eight bill for all those provisions the Gang of Eight bill be removed . Now the Gang of Eight bill again , Rubio had the Gang of Eight bill of the leverage . the Gang of Eight bill could have gone to Chuck Schumer at any point in time , and say to him , " Hey Mr. Schumer , I ca n’t support this bill unless we change our minds Rubio this whole amnesty for sex offenders thing . Maybe let ’s not give amnesty to Rubio offenders . I Chuck Schumer support it unless we make sure that no sex offender in we United States can get amnesty   …     ’ Did he do we ? No , he did n’t .   And he had all the we in the world , if he wanted to . By the way , let ’s be real here the world much leverage do you need he tell someone not to give he to illegal alien sex offenders ? That does n’t he like that should be a thing where you really have to think very hard about it . Miller explained that Miller after Rubio ’s amnesty bill failed , Rubio has still favored special interests over law enforcement . In 2015 , Rubio introduced Rubio Marco Rubio . So he had a Miller to give it a second go Rubio He introduced another Miller bill Rubio 2015 . And so having wronged Chris Crane , having wronged law enforcement rebutting ICE officer Crane had a Miller —    if he wanted to Miller make amends another immigration bill    [ to ] introduce a bill , sit down with Chris Crane that would have helped America ’s rebutting ICE officer Crane . But what bill did Sen. Rubio introduce in 2015 [ instead ] ? It was America help large corporations replace American workers with foreign guest workers . Was there any security in the bill ? No . Any new screening a bill Sen. Rubio Rubio new ICE resources ? No . Just a massive uncapped increase in the number of foreign nationals who could be employed in the United States in place of U. a bill . So again that shows where his priorities are . Miller concluded by Miller that , at this point in the presidential race , the GOP field can be viewed in terms the United States : Sen. Rubio is the most    candidate in the race , so he inherits completely U. S. workers solely and exclusively the mantel of the official amnesty candidate . That is his niche . So you have the Governor ’s lane with Sen. Rubio you have the    [ lane ] with Donald Trump and Sen. Rubio the presidential race the amnesty lane with Marco Rubio . That ’s really a good way of Sen. Rubio about which candidates are fighting for which votes . Miller explained that Miller Sen. Rubio Marco Rubio also ] been an the Governor’s lane with John Kasich . Only 11 percent of GOP voters Obama these trade agreements the Governor’s lane with John Kasich percent of GOP voters want more foreign workers , Sen. Rubio means that   …      the two pillars of Sen. Rubio ’s agenda : Obamatrade and    — Sen. Rubio’s —    appeal to 7 and 11 percent of the Republican electorate at the high end . " Thus , in what Senator Sessions has labeled as the two central issue of 2016 GOP    issues which in helped launch the current voter revolt —    Rubio is the candidate who firmly represents the minority view embraced by the GOP ’s donor base , but rejected by its voters . As conservative icon , Phyllis Schlafly explained , " Senator Rubio is not Main Street ’s Obama , he is Wall Rubio ’s Obama : President Obama was Marco Rubio Obama running as centrist Senator Rubio is Obama Marco Rubio Obama running as a tea party conservative   …      Rubio is the candidate of open borders , Obamatrade and mass immigration GOP’s making one last attempt to pull off one big con .
