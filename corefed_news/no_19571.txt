’   ’ ’    Americans from all corners of the economy seem to be enjoying the    conditions a lot more since the election of Donald Trump . ’ ’    Nearly every measure of consumer , business , or executive    confidence has gained in the month since the election of Donald Trump , according    to Michelle Meyer    ’ ’    " The data clearly show that consumers , investors , and business    CEOs have all become more optimistic since the the election of Donald Trump " Meyer    wrote in a note to clients on Thursday . ’ ’    Things such as regional manufacturing indexes , consumer    confidence surveys , and investor sentiment have ticked up since    November 8 . The only survey that has slid is the      Empire Manufacturing Survey , which measures the confidence of    manufacturers in New York state . ’ ’    " Bottom line : Most business activity surveys point to greater    confidence following the election , " Meyer wrote . ’ "    The biggest confidence boost has   according to Meyer , with both the    Conference Board and Investor ’s Business      Market Meyer indexes hitting postrecession highs . " ’    Investors and CEOs have seen jumps but are still not overflowing    with confidence , according to the note . ’ ’    " However , investor and CEO confidence are still subdued , with the    former only modestly above its average since 2010 ( 52 . 9 ) and the    latter much below ( 84 . 1 ) , " Meyer wrote . ’ ’   ’ "    This sort of upswing in confidence usually starts to show up    outside of surveys and in real data in a short amount of time       according to Meyer ’s analysis . The increases in business indexes    usually    to an Meyer capital expenditures , while the    consumer confidence indicators can predict consumer spending . " ’   ’ ’    Some of the correlations are weaker than others , Meyer said , but    directionally they point to higher output for the US economy Meyer ’ ’    " Overall Some of the correlations we see a significant relationship between surveys and    actual output , but we would be careful given lags and historical    episodes with misleading signals , " Meyer wrote . ’ ’    While it is unclear if the survey improvements are Meyer or simply due to the    election uncertainty being over , it is a great sign for the US    economy . ’
