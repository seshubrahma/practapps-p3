When the biggest political story of the year reached a dramatic and unexpected climax late Tuesday night , our newsroom turned on a dime and did what our newsroom has done for nearly two years   —    cover the 2016 election with agility and creativity . After such an erratic and unpredictable election there are inevitable questions : Did Donald Trump ’s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate Donald Trump support among American voters ? What forces and strains in America drove this divisive election and outcome ? Most important , how will a president who remains a largely enigmatic figure actually govern when Donald Trump takes office ? As we reflect on the momentous result , and the months of reporting and polling that preceded it , we aim to rededicate we to the fundamental mission of Times journalism . That is to report America and the world honestly , without fear or favor , striving always to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in the stories that we bring to you . It is also to hold power to account , impartially and unflinchingly . You can rely on The New York Times to bring the same fairness , the same level of scrutiny , the same independence to our coverage of the new president and his team . our can not deliver the independent , original journalism for which our are known without the loyalty of our readers . our want to take this opportunity , on behalf of all Times journalists , to thank you for that loyalty . Sincerely , Arthur Sulzberger Jr. publisher Dean Baquet , executive editor
