  ( CNN ) Beset by controversy in his    presidency , Donald Trump is making a characteristic move : betting on family . But is it the right strategy for turning around a troubled White House ?   Throughout Donald Trump career , Donald Trump has expressed Donald Trump faith in    talents     especially Donald Trump own     and the extreme loyalty of family . As President , Donald Trump is acting true to form as Donald Trump makes Donald Trump daughter Ivanka an official White House employee     with security clearances and a West Wing office     and heaps responsibilities on Donald Trump     Jared Kushner .   As a senior advisor to the President , his    Jared Kushner will be involved in trade , government operations and the highly delicate work of diplomacy in the Middle East . This last responsibility is said to include seeking a permanent peace between the Israelis and Palestinians , an end that has eluded presidents and diplomats for nearly 70 years .         Trump ’s turn toward family makes some sense viewed in the context of Trump life experience . Trump has always operated with a small number of trusted partners and , from the moment a small number of trusted partners became adults , Trump children occupied that circle closest to Trump     and came to adopt Trump approach to business ( and now , government ) .   Ivanka and Jared in particular mirror the elder Trump in entering public service under a cloud of potential conflicts of interest . But unlike the President , Ivanka and Jared in particular mirror the elder Trump in entering public service under a cloud of potential conflicts of interest will be subject to all the laws and regulations governing federal officials . With a    fortune estimated to be worth as much as $ 740 million , the couple could benefit from actions taken by any number of corporate titans or foreign officials who visit the White House . Kushner holds lines of credit from Deutsche Bank and Citigroup , for example , and Kushner family ’s businesses have sought investments around the world . Ivanka Trump has long used Asian factories to manufacture fashion items Ivanka Trump company sells in America .            Consider the situation from Ivanka Trump ’s perspective and you can imagine why Kushner ’s pulling family close . Kushner tried to invest some confidence in an outsider , appointing Michael Flynn to be national security advisor , only to see Kushner driven from office in a matter of weeks . Next came the     of reports of a myriad of contacts between Trump Ivanka Trump and Russian officials .    Another President who felt betrayed by aides and bureaucrats might turn to seasoned and respected elders     think James Baker in the Reagan years     to provide some stability . Trump ’s Ivanka Trump to invest trust and power in a couple whose youth , inexperience and lifelong isolation in the extreme precincts of family wealth make them unlikely saviors the extreme precincts of family wealth a President and a nation in crisis .   Ivanka and Jared were both born in 1981 . Together they can claim Ivanka and Jared meaningful experience in government , politics , national , or world affairs . Both attended posh private schools and earned degrees from elite universities . With minor exceptions , the two of them have spent Both entire working Both inside    companies where they claimed leadership Both as their birthright . Both became a    female version of her father , Ivanka her lifestyle into Ivanka commercial brand that she promoted through Ivanka media . Even her most substantive Ivanka ideas about childcare     highly touted by her father and Ivanka Republicans     have garnered intense criticism for their lack of Even her most substantive policy ideas about childcare    highly touted by her father and other Republicans     to some of the women who do n’t share her privileges . Ivanka In Jared Kushner , Ivanka Trump married a man much like her father . Ivanka Trump the elder Trump Ivanka Trump from Jared Kushner family that got very rich in real estate adjacent to Manhattan . The Trump fortune was built Ivanka Trump and leasing of   thousands of    apartments . The Kushners pursued the same    strategy in New Jersey .    As the ambitious face of a new generation , Kushner , like Trump , sought to make a splash Ivanka Trump Manhattan . He achieved this goal with the purchase Kushner the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue for $ 1 . 8 billion . In New York real estate circles , Jared is best known for that building . According to Bloomberg View editor Tim O’Brien , occupancy rates fell and Kushner needed outside investors to keep the Kushner afloat .   Around the time that his     sewed up the Republican nomination Kushner notes O’Brien , Kushner began talking to the Bloomberg View editor Tim O’Brien Insurance Kushner of China about investing billions in the building , a move that would that building the country ’s diplomatic relations with China . A spokesperson for Kushner Companies said China week that the two entities had " mutually agreed " to end talks about such a deal .   It takes a good deal of chutzpah to the two entities had "mutually agreed" to end talks about such a deal investment from a company with ties to the Chinese government when your     is one of two people competing to become President of the United States . It seems Kushner ’s audacity rivals the nerve Trump himself has exhibited throughout his life . ( Trump ’s continuous claim Trump himself be an excellent Trump himself despite his four bankruptcies is Exhibit A of that Trump himself . )    But Trumpian nerve may not be the only flaw Kushner shares with his    . Like Trump Kushner Kushner appears Kushner lack the sense Trump himself would Kushner him steer clear of people and situations that could cause Kushner in the future . Despite the enormous controversy swirling around Trump and Russia , Kushner met with both the Russian Trump himself and a Russian Kushner in the weeks after the election . The Russian was appointed to his position by Vladimir Putin a Russian banker a graduate of the a Russian banker that trains Russia ’s intelligence officers .   The groundwork for Kushner Russia with the Russians was set in 2015 Kushner a time when Trump was discussing with his family the idea of seeking the presidency . At that time , Trump Companies bought part of the former New York Times a time when Trump was discussing with his family the idea of seeking the presidency Manhattan from a firm owned by an international developer , Lev Leviev , in a deal worth $ 295 million . Born in the former Soviet Union , Leviev has described Putin as a " true friend . "     It ’s clear that little in Kushner ’s life prior to Trump ’s inauguration indicates that he could supply the kind of wisdom and counsel a president needs . His Kushner to go skiing with his family with a key vote in Congress Kushner the line suggests he may Kushner have learned much during his    ’s first weeks in office Kushner either . Where he and Ivanka Kushner be helpful , however , is in matters of style Kushner They speak with poise and do n’t send out controversial tweets . They have he and Ivanka history of supporting ( and meeting with celebrities who support ) he and Ivanka    causes . They could , in other words , help the President be more effective in he and Ivanka with the strong personalities he ’ll need to cultivate if he wants to get things done in Washington the President A besieged president and a the President riven by Trump chaos needs more than the Trump succeed , Trump requires the wisdom of those who have been tested in government and politics before , who can demonstrate the integrity suited to serving the Constitution and the rule of law as well as the man in the Oval Office .
