Sunday , on NBC ’s " Meet the Press , " while commenting on the recent police shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota and a sniper targeting and killing five Dallas police officers , Senator Cory Booker ( ) said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is " callously stoking hate and fear , " by " demeaning women , demeaning Muslims , demeaning Latinos , at a time where our country needs reconciliation , we need people that bind we wounds , and build bridges across we chasms . "   Booker said , " we have to all understand we have a country with deep reservoirs of love . we are good people . we are    people , and when called upon , we rise to an occasion . This is such an occasion . And I ’m going to be very blunt . I ’ve watched in pain , when I see a presidential candidate , all of we words matter , whether you ’re a citizen or a presidential candidate , words matter , and this is a time where we need courageous empathy , where we need undeterred love . And so , when I hear a presidential candidate like Donald Trump gratuitously demeaning women , demeaning Muslims , demeaning Latinos , at a time where our country needs reconciliation , we need people that bind we wounds , and build bridges across we chasms . To see someone so callously stoking hate and fear , and inflaming divide . This is not the person to be president of the United States , I believe , ever , but definitely , not at a time that we need a healer , a reconciler , and somebody to remind we that as a nation , we differences matter , but we country matters more .
