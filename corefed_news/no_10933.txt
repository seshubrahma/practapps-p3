Breitbart News reported : Trump ’s victory over Trump was cemented Tuesday when the Ohio Republican Party blasted out a press release announcing that the Trump ticket had opened Kasich new " Victory Centers " in the state , and the centers are to be controlled by   . That ’s significant because Ohio ’s " Victory Centers , " which those Victory Centers staffers operate out of , used to be controlled by the state party . For a long time even after Trump became the presumptive nominee , those Victory Centers were getting the Ohio Republican Party for Senate candidate Rob Portman but not for Trump . In    shortly after activists caught Victory Centers party officials trying to get signatures to help Libertarian Gary Johnson , the game changed Trump Breitbart News received a tip that the headquarters for all of the state ’s Victory Centers would be moved out of a state party office and into a new office in Columbus paid for by the Trump campaign . The move was facilitated by the RNC after a    meeting between Trump and Reince Priebus in which Trump negotiated for operational control of existing Ohio victory centers .
