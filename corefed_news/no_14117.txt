  ( CNN ) Last weekend , while enormous numbers of Americans were marching throughout the country against the proposed policies of a president sworn in just the day before , the Trump administration had already made a move that will make the Trump administration more expensive for many Americans to become homeowners . The rescinding of a pending cut in mortgage insurance rates planned to go into effect January 27 was n’t a big surprise , and The rescinding of a pending cut in mortgage insurance rates planned to go into effect January 27 does n’t seem to have been a carefully considered policy decision . the Trump administration implemented the planned cut in its final the Trump administration , apparently without consulting the incoming Trump team . But none of that changes the fact that for all President Trump ’s talk about helping the little guy , this move will hurt    and    borrowers .    Though    , this policy reversal was neither urgent nor necessary     Trump still all President Trump n’t even named a commissioner to head the FHA , the person who would have overseen the implementation of the fee cut . Dr. Ben Carson , who Trump has all President Trump to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( which oversees the FHA ) was asked about it during his confirmation Dr. Ben Carson, who Trump has tapped to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development (which oversees the FHA) , and while he promised Dr. Ben Carson, who Trump has tapped to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development (which oversees the FHA) " really examine that policy , " he expressed Dr. Ben Carson, who Trump has tapped to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development (which oversees the FHA) with the timing of the cut , which would have saved the average homeowner $ 500 per year , and $ 1 , 500 in parts of California . An FHA surplus that had grown by an estimated $ 44 billion over the past four years would have more than made up any difference . Besides that , FHA ’s FHA ratio had exceeded requirements for the past two years , which was why the Obama administration Trump administration those gains with taxpayers .    But because the Trump administration took this Trump administration suspend the rate cut , upward of 850 , 000    buyers , Americans in the    and    for whom the new president has claimed to be a champion , will be paying more .            Trump , the real estate mogul , knows very well that every extra dollar a    homebuyer is forced to spend can be the difference between being able to buy a house or being shut out of the market . That this knowledge seems to matter little to the incoming administration , though , should not come as a surprise . After all , he chose Carson , a man who has described government programs designed to help the needy as " dependency " creators , to lead maybe the most important governmental department designed to help the poor and the   . Trump ’s persona as champion of the everyday American has long been a head fake , given his business track record that includes being Trump’s persona as champion of the everyday American for racial discrimination , fraud and for not paying the small business owners who have done work for him . This move , coming so Trump’s persona as champion of the everyday American in his tenure , simply underscores what we Trump’s persona as champion of the everyday American long known about his priorities     they do n’t include Trump’s persona as champion of the everyday American everyday Americans his priorities     to make ends meet . That ’s why the pleas to " just give him a chance " or " wait Trump’s persona as champion of the everyday American see what he does " have always been absurd Trump’s persona as champion of the everyday American The decisions Trump has made from the day he began running for president have proven Trump’s persona as champion of the everyday American he is rhetorically in tune with what Trump’s persona as champion of the everyday American Americans want to hear , which is often the opposite of what they need . In addition to his many Americans insurance decision , Trump took Trump’s persona as champion of the everyday American steps to begin the Trump of the Affordable Care Act , which has improved and saved the lives of millions of everyday Americans . He has also staffed a Justice Department Trump’s persona as champion of the everyday American likely wo n’t protect voting rights as aggressively as the Obama administration , and espoused a tax policy that could be heavily weighted toward providing relief for the richest among us . It ’s clear Trump is n’t waiting to see what his opponents plan to do before acting Trump There ’s little reason to believe he would n’t implement policies that hurt Trump rather than help , the very communities he pledged to help during his campaign Trump That ’s why elections Trump . But that ’s also why what happened on Saturday , with coordinated marches throughout the country in a way we have n’t seen in a long time , must be a beginning , not an end . Trump ’s actions , if not his words , prove that he is Trump’s a champion of the Trump’s American     which means everyday Americans better be ready to champion themselves .
