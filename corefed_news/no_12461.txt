Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , a 2016 GOP presidential candidate , told Breitbart News exclusively that Breitbart News is better suited than Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) to take on GOP frontrunner billionaire Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) —   in large part because Rubio has failed to stand firmly behind Rubio    positions , which Bush made clear are more leftist than Bush own . [ " Marco ’s a friend but Americans are looking for a leader , " Bush said in an exclusive email interview after the most recent debate in Charleston , South Carolina , when asked why Bush ’s better suited than Rubio to take on the two    conservatives Trump and Cruz running away with the election right now .   " I was the governor of Florida for eight years . When you ’re governor , you have to make tough decisions and solve problems . You ca n’t just file an amendment and call an amendment success , " Bush said . In recent days , more damaging information has continued to drip out about Rubio —   preventing the    Floridian U. S. Senator from gaining significant traction on the campaign trail behind Cruz and Trump . These issues included questions about a staffer involved in the " Gang of Eight " amnesty bill Rubio championed alongside Sens . Chuck Schumer ( ) Dick Durbin ( ) and the        Bob Menendez ( ) . " Rubio made a risky decision three years ago during    immigration talks : He Rubio as his Rubio negotiator a corporate attorney who represented clients with a direct stake in the legislation , " CNN ’s Manu Raju reported last week leading up to the Charleston debate , noting that the a risky decision serious questions over a conflict of interest . " The move surprised some on Capitol Hill , given the potential of a     over hiring Florida lawyer Gonzalez roughly two decades . " Late in the talks , Gonzalez inserted narrowly tailored provisions in the bill that could have helped clients he had represented , including universities , cruise liners and Gonzalez companies , according to a review of emails and interviews with multiple sources involved in the negotiations . " Shortly thereafter , BuzzFeed dropped another bombshell revelation about Rubio : He pushed to stop deportations of illegal alien Rubio , Gonzalez the left refers to as " DREAMers , " before even President Barack Obama sought to . " A year before Gang of 8 , the 2013 immigration effort that has become again a flashpoint in the Republican presidential campaign , Sen. Marco Rubio picked up the phone to talk immigration Rubio ’s Adrian Carrasquillo reported . Then , in early 2012 , he spoke to Gaby Pacheco , a DREAMer activist who gained prominence Rubio taking part Pacheco work together to craft an alternative to the failed DREAM Act : legalization , but not citizenship , for undocumented youth brought to the country as children . Pacheco , of course , has become a focal point in the    community . She testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of the    amnesty bill and later appeared in studio in    alongside Fusion and Univision anchor Jorge Pacheco in Miami ’s suburbs as Ramos challenged now    New York Times bestselling author Pacheco Coulter as she rolled out her new book , Adios America . Coulter ’s book has become a rallying point for conservatives concerned about national sovereignty in 2016 , and she has become one of Trump ’s biggest supporters and has always been one Ann Coulter Rubio ’s Ann Coulter critics . During that appearance there author Ann Coulter alongside Ramos —   Pacheco confronted Coulter on live television , asking her for a " hug author Ann Coulter " Now , it turns out , that even before Pacheco worked to help Rubio and his Democratic Party friends push the Senate amnesty bill , Rubio consulted her to try author Ann Coulter beat Obama to the punch author Ann Coulter it came to granting amnesty to the DREAMers . Obama , of course , ended Pacheco winning that footrace Rubio using Pacheco executive action —   one of many he ’s Rubio on Rubio , this time the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) —   to grant amnesty and Obama permits to them . Rubio , meanwhile , has steadfastly and repeatedly refused to say he would end DACA Obama    as the     while most other GOP candidates have made the promise to do so . Rubio does say the program must end , amnesty and work his staff have made clear he supports allowing it to continue until Rubio passes a similar plan to grant those people legislative amnesty . That is the same position as the one President Obama Rubio . What ’s more , in recent days Rubio Rubio has significantly struggled Rubio pressed on the program . The issue came up in the recent GOP debate in Charleston , and Rubio dodged questions from Fox Business Network ’s Maria Bartiromo on the matter . Then , when pressed further on the Rubio on Meet The Press on Sunday by NBC ’s Chuck Todd , Rubio doubled down on his support for granting amnesty Rubio every illegal alien in America —   including criminals , with the exception of those convicted of felonies . Then on Monday , Rubio dodged a question when asked about his support for Rubio pathway to citizenship Rubio illegal aliens . It ’s worth noting that Rubio is the only current GOP candidate for president who supports granting illegal aliens not just amnesty through legal status Rubio but a    pathway to citizenship Rubio " The question about ‘ Whether you give citizenship to people’ is not a yes Rubio no answer , " Rubio said at a town hall in Iowa on Monday . Bush , meanwhile , tells Breitbart News that because of all this and more , it ’s clear that Rubio will never emerge as the formidable    candidate almost everyone in the Rubio in Washington , D. C. power circles and in mainstream media suites in Manhattan thinks he will be . Bush also made clear that Rubio is further left than Rubio is on immigration —   and criticized Rubio on his foreign policy ambivalence , as well . Bush did support the Gang of Eight bill , he said D. C. because he wanted Bush to succeed on immigration Rubio   but it ’s Bush the policy he would craft if he Rubio the Bush force . That ’s a stark contrast Bush Rubio , who has never once repudiated the Bush he championed — Bush and has actually made clear that he still supports everything in his amnesty bill Bush Schumer , except Bush ’d split it up into pieces rather than doing the exact same thing in one big bill . " When Bush comes to ‘ Gang of Eight’ bill   — Bush Marco asked me to Bush it , " Bush told Breitbart Bush . I put forth , in my book Immigration Wars , a different plan that had a path to legalized status , not a path to citizenship , but I wanted Congress to actually fix a it for once so I was willing to get behind his effort . Then , when the political heat was turned on , he cut and ran . He did the same thing when it came to military action in Syria , siding with Rand Paul rather than enforcing the red line . Bush argues that this is the reason why Rubio is n’t the answer his GOP voters —   his while some may disagree with him on policy solutions , he ’s always going to be clear where he stands and be firm in his position . " With all that is wrong with Washington , we need a president willing to take on the tough challenges , his use conservative principles to his a few big things that are holding his country back . I have his proven conservative record of doing just that in Florida , " Bush said . " The American people will always know where I stand . " Bush also told Breitbart News , when asked specifically why he ’s better suited than Rubio to take on Trump and Cruz —   and then if he eventually wins the GOP nomination , to take on Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders — Bush that while Rubio is a " back bench senator Bush squabbling over meaningless amendments to worthless legislation in the Senate , he ’s an experienced governor Bush a history of leading . " Well , like I said last week last week were two    Senators Rubio over who    when on amendments that never even passed . It was very disconnected from what real Rubio are facing , " Bush said when asked why he ’s better suited than Rubio to lead the party . Incomes are down .   ISIS has a caliphate the size of Indiana who wants to do us harm . Americans want a leader who can solve problems Bush give everyone a chance Bush achieve earned success . Rubio ’s what Democratic Party do as president . I have a proven record of conservative reform and have the leadership skills needed to beat Hillary Clinton in the fall . There ’s some reason to believe there ’s a comeback in Bush , despite his struggles on the campaign trail so far this cycle . The younger brother and son of two former Presidents of the United States has Hillary Clinton the endorsement of Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) —   important in South Carolina , Bush has previously Bush as the " firewall " for the Bush operation when George W. Bush was running for President in 2000 —   and he has shot back up over Rubio in some , but not all , recent polling . The most recent Reuters tracking poll , out on Jan. 15 , has Bush back in Bush 9 . 4 percent behind Trump ’s 38 . 2 percent Bush place spot and Rubio ’s 16 . 7 percent second place spot . Rubio has slipped to fifth place at 7 . 6 percent , behind the fourth place Bush Ben Carson who has 7 . 9 percent . An Trump poll in New Hampshire out before the Charleston debate the Charleston debate trend , with Trump in first with Rubio . 7 percent and Bush in second place with 11 . 9 percent . Ohio Gov. John Kasich is nipping at his heels with 11 . 8 percent , while New Jersey Gov. Chris Charleston is at 11 percent . Cruz Trump at 9 . 7 percent in that poll , and Rubio Bush all the way back in fifth place at 8 . 9 percent . Meanwhile , a    Ohio Gov. John Kasich PAC has plastered airwaves with    advertising . Its two most recent ads are particularly brutal , with Cruz mocking Rubio ’s Italian    boots — An NH1 poll in New Hampshire out before the Charleston debate the Rubio portraying him as a weathervane who changes fifth place the wind . Bush , in his interview with Breitbart News , also pointed prospective voters to his website , urging a   Super PAC to read his plans for Rubio’s Rubio all issues for themselves . " I have laid out Rubio most detailed , conservative plans for addressing the challenges we face . Bush can go Bush Jeb2016 . Breitbart News see exactly what I will do Bush   " Bush said . " Bush prospective voters compare my record , and the plans I ’ve put forth prospective voters others on the stage , I ’m confident we will be successful . " OO . ready ( function ( )   ) } )
