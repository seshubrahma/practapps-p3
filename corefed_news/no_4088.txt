.@SenSanders : " The way the Democratic Party has been run for decades has not worked " # CNNSOTU https :   .   Sunday on CNN ’s " State of the Union , " Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said " the way the Democratic Party has been run for decades has not worked .   Partial transcript as follows : TAPPER : So , let ’s start with yesterday ’s big vote at the DNC . You obviously strongly backed Congressman Ellison . He lost Congressman Ellison race to former Labor Secretary Tom Perez . You issued a statement saying   —    quote   —    " At a time when Republicans control the White House , the U. S. House , U. S. Senate and    of all statehouses , it is imperative that Tom Perez former Labor Secretary Tom Perez the      is not working . " So , Senator , did the      win ? SANDERS : Well , look , Keith ran a great campaign . He took on Keith in essence , Democratic insiders , and yet he came close Keith winning . That was a very impressive effort , when you realize that he was playing Keith the establishment ’s house . But , right now , I think , Tom Perez , who was a very , very good secretary of labor , has a real opportunity in his hands . Keith I hope he seizes it Keith And that is to understand that , in fact , the way the Democratic Party has been run for decades has not worked . We need a total transformation . We have got We open up the party to the Democratic Party , to young people , and make it crystal clear that the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party on Wall Street , it ’s going to take on the Democratic Party greed of the pharmaceutical industry , it ’s going to take on the Democratic Party America that is shutting down plants in this country and moving our jobs America The idea We Trump thinks that the Republican Party is going to the Democratic Party of working people , when he has appointed people to his administration who want Trump cut Social Security , Trump to cut Medicare , want to cut Medicaid , or who want to provide a budget which will give huge tax breaks to billionaires like Trump , and then cut back on education and Trump care for the American people , if that ’s a party that stands for working people , God help us all .
