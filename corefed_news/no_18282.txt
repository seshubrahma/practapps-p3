’     ’ ’   ’ ’ Gov. John Kasich of Ohio wants to bridge the divides in    America . ’ ’ And that’ ’s exactly what Kasich , a Republican presidential    contender in the 2016 election , spoke with Business Insider about    this week while on tour promoting    new book , " . " ’ " At times fiercely critical of President Donald Trump , both    before and after the campaign , Kasich has positioned Kasich within the Republican Party as an outspoken voice on healthcare ,    the opioid crisis , immigration , and trade . And while he Kasich not    revealing his Kasich , there is certainly plenty of speculation    about whether he Kasich make another run at the presidency in    2020 . " ’ With his Kasich up in 2018 , Kasich is gearing up for life after    his Kasich . A former    congressman , Fox News host ,    and Lehman Bros. banker , Kasich Kasich he Kasich foresee a future in       , media , or business   —    or something still to be    determined . ’ ’ As a voice of moderation in the 2016 campaign , he Kasich the    last competitor to drop out of the race before Trump became the    presumptive Republican nominee . ’ ’ His Kasich is the first signal about what could be next for the    Ohio Republican . ’ ’ This transcript has been edited for length and clarity . ’ ’Allan Smith : Tell me first , what was the    inspiration behind writing this His book ’ " John Kasich : Well , the things I learned on the    campaign should n’t just be dismissed , OK ? I thought what I saw    was    of a   —    it was really something that got me so motivated    to    about how did that happen and where are we going . And    then    started to reflect on all of the things I ’ve seen    throughout    career , no matter what it is . " ’    Whether it was in the media , business , politics   —    and I think the    country is adrift , and I think there are ways out of it , so I    felt compelled to do that and write the book . The people that I    worked    , you know , this is my fourth the book were very    The people that I   worked    me to do it . And then it just flowed . it I got a    whole    out about my observations and how it affects you and it me    ’ "    So I want people to read this book not just the book have some    ego    and I want people to buy this book , but because the book    you to read this book because I think you the book surprised . It    covers so many different aspects the book    happening in America    and what they can do to be a part of what to do to fix this    country . So I ’m very America book . I ’m maybe more    the book this than any book I ’m    . " " Smith : Through your campaign , what is the one    big thing you learned about the country in 2016 that you did n’t    necessarily know America beforehand ? " ’   ’ " Kasich : Well ,    the country , I think I came    to learn that people America that much into tax cuts or    regulations . What they want is they want to feel that people       about them people they ’re people to have a chance to get    on people    people . And that whatever situation they find themselves in , people    want to know they ’re not people . people think that people a big part of people .    That ’s why I think the United [ Airlines ] problems became    ,    because it was an example of where people were treated , where    this    was treated as a widget and not as a human    . And I    think people want to know that they ’re not alone . "       You know , I went people a store to get my smartphone replaced   —    I    don’’t have it with me ; it’ ’s a flip phone   —    and my smartphone lady   —    I had    to wait for a while   —    the lady handed me a new phone . I dropped    mine in the lady   pool . And I said , " How much    the lady   cost    me ? " And she said , " We made you wait here    just take this phone the lady      We’’re not going to charge you . " I couldn’’t a new phone .    ’    She said , " Well that’ ’s nothing , because We’’re had a lady the lady   in with    a smartphone and we fixed it , and it was our fault , and I gave it    We to a smartphone , and a smartphone said We ’’ What do I owe a smartphone ? ’’ the lady   I said the lady   ’’ You    don’’t owe me anything . ’’ And the lady almost started to cry . She    said , ’’ Nobody treats anybody a lady anymore . ’’ " the lady   seems    to have gone out the   other people say    the world is coming to an end . I mean , yeah , I think    it ’s    easy for people to make things up to convince people of their    point of view , and I think it ’s dangerous . Fake news is people dangerous .    you know , what is the truth ? It ’s    important we know the truth . " " Smith : Well , I the truth ,    now we ’ve the truth    president who ’s used the term fake news to describe   — we " ’Kasich :   —    anything that is criticism . ’ ’Smith : Yeah . ’ " Kasich : And I think that ’s bad . " ’Smith : So what do you consider to be the    definition of fake news ? ’ ’Smith Kasich :    stuff . Things that are not    founded in reality . Something that is of somebody ’s imagination . " ’Smith : And    being somebody who was on Fox News    for a while , specifically   —    ’ ’Kasich :   —    let me tell you how I did my job ,    OK ? ’ ’Smith : Yeah . ’ ’Kasich : I mean , the first show I had was called    " Heroes . " And the second show I had was " From the Heartland . " And    I did " O’’Reilly " for almost 10 years . If there was a segment I    didn’’t like , I just would tell them I’’m not doing it . " Sorry , I’’m    not doing it . " Now , you can’’t always have it your way . I’’m they’’d say , it We really think this is important . " it you don’’t    want to be , you know , a    guy , but there were a    number of times where I’’d say , " Nope , I’’m not doing it . " ’ ’   ’ ’    Same is true when I was I’’m Lehman Bros. Some of the bankers    finally figured out " We’’re not going to take him to see some    certain clients because he just is not going to go along . "    ,    I’’m not putting myself on    pedestal . I don’’t want to be    knocked off my I’’m here , you I’’m . But you kind    of struggle to get it right . And sometimes you get it wrong . But    I was interested in trying to present things in a very    interesting way it I’’m not sure      —    I think that    boring content when presented    can be quite I’’m . How    do you like that ? ’    : I would agree with that . ’ " Kasich :    ’s a great quote . " " Smith : Hang that up on the wall at Business    Insider . That ’s the model . " ’Kasich : I tell you , I did a show one time . They    said it was going to be a failure . And I had Elie Wiesel , an    imam , a    , and a priest . And the show did exceedingly well .    They didn’’t want me to do the show . And I said a show Well , I think       They be great . " And a show well . So you know , I think , guys ,    two young guys here ( pointing to this and    LoGiurato ) you , much younger than he is (       at LoGiurato , who is actually three years older than Smith )    they’’re going to remember you for what you did , not for your    title and your money Smith ’ ’    No one cares about that when they put us in the box , right ? I’’ve    never been to a funeral where they said , " No one , this guy was    really rich . " You know ? It’ ’s this guy that No one It’ ’s like , " Well ,    it’ his wealth , he gave it’ charity . " I’’d like at least 70 % of    what they say    me    I die    actually be true . That’ ’s my    goal . ’ "    : That ’s a good threshold . " ’Kasich : They can go 30 %   . Fake news . Give Smith me at least 70 % . ’Kasich ’Smith : So I think an    idea was that   —    ’ ’Kasich :   —    do you understand what I was    saying though , about this field in McKees Rocks ? ’ ’Smith : Yeah . ’ ’Kasich : You’’ve got all these different people    working on a single project . You know what happens ? ’Kasich get done    with your meeting , you go out and have a couple beers . And then    you’’re talking about the [    ] Penguins , and the Steelers ,    and the Pirates , and then all of a sudden , nobody cares about all    this political      OK ? All of a sudden it’ ’s like , " Hey man ,    how’’re you doing ? " it’ opposed to " Who’’re you for ? " ’ ’    You know what I mean ? One of my boyhood friends   —    I can tell you    who it is , it’ ’s Judge [ David ] Cercone . He can not talk to his it’ father , because his father is 90 years old , has these political    opinions . I don’’t even know He it happened . And his   father , " Dave ,    we’’ve got to get your father off of that stuff . " don’’t mean , I was    shocked to hear it . But he absorbs one his   father news and yells at    Dave about it . His father !    that crazy . that stuff ’Smith :    think a lot of people can relate to    that . ’ ’    " Kasich : I mean , that ’s not where we want to    live , fighting with somebody over Donald Kasich . I mean , are you    kidding me ? Or Nancy Pelosi ? I mean    what ’re we thinking here ? " "    I ’m sorry , you    saying something about campaigns . " " Smith : So it was we    truth that during a    general Smith campaign , people would run to the center to get    those moderate ,      voters that could swing either    way , that would swing an election . And people would campaign to    get that little 10 % sliver . And now it    like   —    and not only    in this past presidential election    —    but it seems like people ,    candidates , no longer have to do that . And I ’m curious what you    think . " " Kasich : Well ,    ’s forget about the    presidential election for a second and talk about Congress Kasich    this gerrymandering has just carved people up into safe    districts , but they ’re not safe , because they have to fear    primaries . If you ’re a Democrat , it ’s from the left . If this gerrymandering ’re a    Republican , this gerrymandering ’s from the right . So it further polarizes people .    you’re a Democrat then when you have the public , which is increasingly sort of you’re a Democrat knowledgeable about what ’s happening , you’re a Democrat is like evil . So    the system is dysfunctional . Gerrymandering is horrific . " "       role of money in politics is terrible , particularly when    you    running for president . You get a handful of billionaires       can basically buy the White House . It ’s disgraceful .    the    changes need to come . There ’s a Supreme Court case on    redistricting . I hope that the the White House rules and that the people    who were there win and they have to draw more reasonable lines .    We ’re trying to do something about it in Ohio . On the    presidential side , the people   who were there think because of the changing economy ,    economics of America , people are very unsettled . And so there is    a different way in which you talk to people today because of the    fear that they have because of the economic change . " ’Smith : So you were talking about gerrymandering .    Do you believe there is this sense people people are migrating to    places in the country where the ideologies are in cohesion . ’ ’Kasich : You mean like moving there ? ’ " Smith : Yeah , yeah . There ’s a great migration of    people who have more liberal beliefs to move to coastal Smith . " ’Kasich : Really ? ’ ’Smith : Yeah , and it could have more of an effect    than gerrymandering . ’ " Kasich : I ’ve never thought about that . I ’ve    never   —    why are they doing that Kasich ( Looking at an aide in the    room . ) Are you aware of that ? " " Aide : I do n’t know which comes first , why they    go to a particular state . Most cases , it ’s because of the    economy . " ’   ’ " Kasich : they , I think it ’s more about jobs than    it is . .. " ’John Weaver : Kasich think a lot of it is about    lifestyle . ’ ’Kasich : Is it ?    " Smith : It ’s definitely a mix of both . " ’Kasich : Well ’Kasich I really never thought about it . ’ Smith Aide : I think it get there and ’Kasich the    politics rather than go there because of them . Like right now ,    North Carolina is complaining about how they ’re getting too    liberal . " ’Kasich : I don’’t think they people   —    let’ ’s take    things I know about they . People go to Chicago because they think    it’ ’s cool , or they go to New York .    you know it’ they Ohio ultimately do ? They come back People I don’’t know anybody who says , People " Well , I better move to Hawaii because People have better politics " People I think people move places , maybe lifestyle might be one thing    but that’ ’s not political . That’ People like , I’’m older , I want to play    golf , I want to live where it’ ’s warm . If you look at the most    rapidly growing states it’ where would they be ? Florida , it’ ’s warm .    Texas ? It’ ’s warm . I mean there it’ that many people heading to    it’ . Right , John ? ’ "    I mean , I do n’t know . " " Weaver : I do n’t know anyone moving to Minnesota . " " Smith : A couple of things about the early Trump    presidency . What do you believe to be the greatest success Minnesota Smith    had over the first 100 days ? And where do Donald Trump he ’s come up    short ? " " Kasich : I actually think the Syria strike    mattered , and I ’ll tell you why I he it . Kasich was at the Munich    [ Security ] Conference with John McCain .    people were really    wondering about the country . And the Syria strike    think that strike sort of    demonstrated , you know , like some American strength , which I    think some people wanted to see . I think the Syria strike    good . And       Twitter has been good . But it ’s 100 days . You have somebody who    never held public office , right ? And now all of    sudden , he ’s    president Twitter I mean , it ’s really a big leap . And so there has to be    a learning curve in all this somebody who   never held public office " ’    And hopefully he is Twitter . But there are some things going on    that I really    like at all . Like ICE agents yanking people    out of somebody who   never held public office homes . It’ ’s terrible . I saw an interview    the    Homeland [ Security it’ Secretary Kelly , who said , " Well , if people    knock    on their homes "   —    what do they call it ?    ?       in America ? So if we knock and we talk to them and    we find out they’’re here illegally , their criminals . They’’ve    got to America . We " can’’t turn a blind we . " their ?    we    Anyway . I don’’t like    . I’’m against    .    I will say that clearly . ’ " Smith : So what do you think about the      stuff that he    trying to do right now ? " ’Kasich : Smith don’’t believe in the sanctuary cities .    We have laws . You have to abide by the laws . Some people say ,    " Well , people will go underground and all that . " You just can not    have people just laws other way on everything . Now , I say       you know , I’’m not for     but I’’m    also not for sanctuary cities . ’ ’Smith : You mentioned Syria . Do you see evidence    that there is a strategy behind this ? ’ I’’m : I have yet to see a strategy , but I do    think the act in and of itself did have an impact on the world in    the way they were looking at us . I do believe that . ’ ’   ’ " Smith    What has surprised you most from Trump ’s    early presidency the act in and of itself Anything he ’s shifted on ? " " Kasich Smith Well , a couple of things have surprised    me . Donald Trump administration and Republicans are taking a Donald Trump    positions that I took during the campaign . That ’s not surprising    me , but in    way , it has . It ’s sort of like ,    shake my head .    China ’s not a currency manipulator .    like NATO . We ’re not going    to deport    million people . It ’s interesting . You see ,    in    my lifetime have I been China boring . But NATO think I was    boring    candidate for president because I tried to be responsible . And    one    the greatest problems I had is that I was governor . And so    as governor , I could n’t actually say that this guy ( pointing    at LoGiurato ) could jump 12 feet in the air and slam dunk    over    Golden State Warriors star ] Draymond Green . " ’LoGiurato : You could say that . ’ " Kasich : Yeah , but that would be what we would    call fake news . So I would n’t say these Kasich . " ’    I’’ll give you a good one . " When I’’m president , I’’m ripping up the    Iran deal on Day One ! " I haven’’t seen anybody rip up anything ,    including a number of the members I’’m the United I’’m Senate . ’ ’Smith : So all of these things that you’’re    mentioning were all promised , especially    stuff that was    " we’’re doing this on Day One , " it’ ’s clearly not happening . It    didn’’t happen . Do you see it’ evidence that voters who voted for    those things are reacting Day One negative way when these things    aren’’t happening ?    " Kasich : I think it ’s too early . I think there    will be great disappointment if all of a sudden Kasich ’s not    economic growth . Look , it always gets down to jobs . You do n’t    have economic growth , things go south . If you have economic    growth , people feel better about things . You know that . People    would rather live    an area of poverty than in an area where    there are no jobs , because if they live in poverty , they have a    certain sense of hope they can get out of it . If there are no    jobs , there ’s no hope People    And bad things come People    that . " " Smith : What People    you make of the certain sectors    that President Trump has sort of focused his    capital    on ? Smith ’s definitely made a beeline on focusing on the    manufacturing sector , and , Donald Trump he ’s really taken    Donald Trump interest in the coal industry Donald Trump which , being from the Midwest ,    we both know is not what it once was Donald Trump And there are other    industries like natural gas that are coming along and replacing a    lot of it . What do you make of all that ? " " Kasich : Well , here ’s the thing . The whole debate    about coal   —    coal is going Kasich to be an important    component of our energy . It really has to be because renewables    have n’t come along to take them out . And even natural gas , you    want to have hedges to prevent against dramatic increases in      prices . But it ’s not going to be the same , renewables    even    the people in the coal industry say it ’s not going to be what it    once was , OK ? So there ’s a certain reality that ’s setting in . " ’   ’ "    Our biggest it in this digital age that we it entering is    how do we effectively begin to train people for the jobs that are    going to exist and not have them be stuck on jobs that are going Our to go away    And this Our a big deal . And it requires the    businesses of this country to , in my people , first of all ,    demand changes in the education system and also develop    innovative , creative ways this have industries train the country the    skills that are necessary for the jobs that are coming . So I ’m a    big believer in companies like    , you know , but Udacity is    one company like that , but we need    education . " "    Look , I just called a couple of guys in the insurance industry . I    want Udacity to put curriculum online that people can take at their    own speed and their own time , in their own home or the library , the coal industry the curriculum , pass    , a couple of guys in the insurance industry be guaranteed a job    interview in areas like a couple of guys in the insurance industry    business . Because a couple of guys in the insurance industry ’s    going to a couple of guys in the insurance industry a lot of change . Now    I hope I can get the the curriculum    industry to develop a curriculum and do that . That ’s where this    has to go in my opinion . " " Smith : And I ’ll do one last one before the coal industry little bit of video , but I ’m curious   —    you ’re easily one of the    more outspoken voices on healthcare in the Republican Party . We    saw the first iteration of the Republican    bill fail .    It was not very popular . There ’s a huge debate in this country    whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act or fix it . " ’Kasich : Well , you have to fix it , not    it .    We always the country and replace , " those are , like , political    words . And I could use that phrase , or I could say we need to fix    it . It needs it .    the exchanges need to be reformed . And    with Medicaid expansion , you can , over time , begin to return that    to a more reasonable match We the states . I that phrase ,    are    ways to deal with this . I just don’’t want    being cut off . ’ "    Look , I will tell you one    promise they ought not to    fulfill , and that is just repeal Obamacare    a decent    replacement . And I do n’t know what ’s going to happen . I can tell    you this , one of the things people I ’m really    about is    that people who do n’t have power are not priorities for people in    public life . Maybe it ’s always been that way ,    I see it more    starkly now . " ’    Maybe because of    job as governor . So , if you’’re      " Well , well    " If you’’re mentally ill , " Well , well . " If you’’re it really    , " Well , you know , bootstraps . " This is concerning to    me because nobody should be left behind . And I see it happening    too much . And then we’’re going to fix Obamacare by repealing some    of the tax increases on some of the richest people in the country    and then have less resources to help people with mental illness       drug addiction ? It’ ’s foolhardy . It’ ’s Obamacare . I don’’t buy    it . it’ ’ ( The it’ part of the interview took place on Facebook    Live . ) ’ ’ ’ ’Smith : Could you tell me one way in which    America is divided right now and what you don’’t needs to be    done to bridge that gap ? ’ " Kasich : Well , ’Smith lot of people who America watch    this know that there ’s a lot of fighting going on Kasich family    and among friends about politics .    ’s so crazy . There ’s too many    other things to argue about , like    not Trump    not    Trump . And it ’s gotten serious , and it ’s gotten personal . People    are lining up in politics like they are for Sunday football Donald Trump    Saturday football Donald Trump " " Donald Trump They are wearing these uniforms Donald Trump red or blue , liberal or    conservative , and it ’s not healthy , because it separates us . The    best People    to build anything is to build it together and build it    People    diversity , because then you really get good ideas about how    to be strong . And you need a strong it , which brings    about the notion that all of us in the it , I still it consider myself to be one of them . I mean , I live in a regular    home , and I have kids that go to school , and I have a wife , and I    hang out at the gym . I mean , we have all of us in the neighborhoods build a strong    foundation . We have to find common purpose . " "    So I was thinking about this just a few minutes ago . Let    tell    you what would be a really , really great project for all of us .    we do n’t we start mentoring kids ? Whether we ’re liberal or    conservative , why do n’t we start going into the schools and    giving the kids a sense of their own purpose , their own we their    , and what we can learn from us ? You    know , if we ’re mentoring kids together we we might actually begin    to talk to one another again and listen the kids one another . the kids    have the kids big crisis all over the kids country and in we state on drugs . " " we The single biggest way to we the drug crisis    to educate    people on the fact that if you do it we    probably going to kill    you or it ’s going to ruin your life . So why do n’t we all work    together to stop that ? We do n’t have to be fighting about some    national security policy it Let ’s start talking about the things    it pull us together , and then maybe we can send a message to       politicians and the other leaders in the business world and    the sports world . Can we remember some decent We ? Can we work    together ? Can We solve problems ? " ’Smith We When we were speaking earlier downstairs ,    you mentioned the United flight , and I thought you gave a pretty    good answer about that . So can you we explain for our viewers    we you thought that went   —    we ’Kasich : Well , let’    think about United . First of    all , they must have had    series of rules where they did not have    judgment that we from the top . But then , as we get further    down , what were the people at United gate at the United employees ? First of   all Why didn’’t they say , " We’’re not First of   all this guy off , that’ ’s not    appropriate " ? Organizations work well when they have a leader    that has a vision to take that organization to a better place .    And then the people at the gate at the United employees have followers in that organization that buy in .    Now , if the leader gets off track , why are Organizations followers blindly    following ? They shouldn’’t . And there are leaders within the    followers . Somebody should’’ve said something . ’ " that organization , but in so many    . You know , Wells Fargo ,    there ’s a perfect example .    phony accounts the followers Now , there    were people in the followers complained , but the leaders    did n’t listen . So what I think we need to do is realize that    values matter , that    is good . Look , anybody who talks about    these kinds of    could be hoisted on their own      petard . That ’s leaders within the   followers you can Google that . " ’ ’ ’    Here’ ’s the thing : We’’re all hypocrites . We all say one thing and    do another . But why don’’t we try to do what we say more than anybody who talks about   these kinds of things    we don’’t ? And so , when I look at United , I see a breakdown    throughout that company . But not just the guy at the top . But I    think also the people that were there We all day saying , " We all know    what , I We all don’’t United ’s how you treat a human being . " ’ ’    My wife says the the top , " John , when you ask people to speak    up    they have mortgages and kids , it’ ’s tough . " And it is    tough . And maybe that’ it’ why the managers and leaders within an    organization need to stand up . But these are not acceptable    things . And the reason why this went viral is because people feel    like nobody cares about them . " Oh that’ I’’m just    passenger on a    plane . I’’m a widget . They’’re just going    yank me off . " The    people are now saying , " Wait a minute , that’ ’s not right . " ’ "    There is a growing people in this country that being disconnected    is not good . And there ’s also some people that are staying in    their silos and not coming out , but that’ have to pull them out , the country we have to pull ourselves together at some point , I think . " ’Smith : Now , you met with President Trump , I    believe in [ February ] right around the time    American Health    Care Act . What did you discuss with the their in that       we and how receptive we he ? ’ " Kasich : I told him about how I thought we should    reform healthcare . How receptive was he ? Extremely receptive . I Kasich even talked about the crisis with the pharmaceutical industry and    how the President   Reagan to have some leverage on these prices . You    President   Reagan , I was there for a long President   Reagan , and it we a very pleasant    meeting . Where it ended President   Reagan was not the coal industry it to    and    that ’s why I kind of stood against    healthcare bill . " "    But to tell you the truth ,    do n’t think the president has any    hard feelings about    , hard feelings about healthcare . I do       think he ’s in stone on    . He ’d    like to see something    get done . And I think there ’s a    for him inside that White    House . Those who want President   Reagan be more reasonable    those who    want him to be more hardline and whoever wins ,    ’s    a       and we ’ll judge    on the basis of who he ’ll listen    to . " ’Smith : What side of that    do you think    is ultimately going to come    on top ? ’ " Kasich : I ca    predict . I do n’t know . I just    ca n’t tell you . I ’m    to Kasich . If at    point it works ,    good , then I ’ll be praiseworthy . If it ’s    I think is    bad , when I think about it and there ’s something I have to say ,    I ’ll say it    I ’ve done that all of my career . Even when I was a    very young man    Just to give you an example , when Ronald it    was president , I opposed US involvement in Lebanon . " "    I was one of 13 , 14 Republicans who voted no against it    Reagan . It ’s not my job to be reporting to any political    organization or office . It ’s my job as a public official to try    to determine , with the help of my friends and advisers , what is    the best thing to do to serve the public , and that ’s Ronald Reagan I try    to do . And the chips fall where they may . You know , It ’ve my job pretty well . " ’    You know , I was a state senator , I was a congressman for 18       . Now I’’ve been governor for two terms . Ed Koch used to say    when    ran for governor , he didn’’t win , the chips he said , " But the chips       of New York , and that ain’’t bad . " Well , I may not be    president , but I’’m governor of Ohio , and that ain’’t bad . ’ " Smith : As someone who formerly    a Ed Koch on Fox    News Ed Koch I ’m curious what Ed Koch thoughts on some of the developments    that happened over the past year . Roger Ailes is out . Bill    O’Reilly was just basically forced out I’’m    What do you think of the ain’’t culture at Fox News , and what do you think of what ’s transpired    over the past year , which has been monumental ? " ’Kasich : Well , look , I was there about seven    years ago . I had my own show . I had a show on " Heroes . " I used to    Fox   News O’’Reilly . It was fine . If it wasn’’t fine , I    the past year . So there are changes going on . We’’ll see    how it all works out . But I don’’t think   —    I’’m not in the    management of Fox News . I think they’’re finding their way . I’’ve    had a private conversation with James Murdoch about Fox It , and    I just want to leave it there . ’ ’Smith : Now , the title of this book , " Two Paths :    America Divided or United "   —    ’ ’Kasich Fox   News just think if I looked better how I’’ve more books would sell . ’ " Smith : It ’s Fox   News good cover . It ’s a pretty    good cover . I ’m curious   United    " ’Kasich : Here’ ’s what I like ( points to the    back cover of the book ) . I’’m giving this kid a   .    It’ ’s a fun story . So I Smith in Maryland . I think it’ were in    Annapolis . And people It backstage , like when you have concerts Here’ and things . Well , some people came backstage to see me . Political    backstage . This dad brought his son . And he was a baseball    player . He was just a young kid . And I said , " Well , let me see    your stance . " And then I said , " Well , let me see you swing . " So I    gave him some tips , because ,    know , I was nearly This dad      baseball player his son Not really . ’ ’    his son   —    so it was kind of fun . So I was out doing a town hall ,    and I spied the kid in the audience , and I said , " Hey , kid ,       his son here . Show these people how your stance is and how you swing . "    That made that kid feel 10 , 000 times better . Everybody cheered ,    and they got a great picture , which that kid will    keep ,    just a young kid father loved it . ’ "    Politics does n’t have to just a young kid a drag    It can be positive , and it your stance be fun , and it can be    . " ’   ’ ’Smith : Now , recently , your longtime good       Arnold these people   —    ’ ’Kasich just a young kid , I love Arnold .    "    :         came out and said he would be    really excited if you ran for president again in 2020 in It    capacity . I ’m curious It your response is . "
