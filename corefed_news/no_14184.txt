  ( CNN ) During more than a decade covering the Middle East , I ’ve met and interviewed dozens of people from the region who have visas to the US .   They are students , family members of US citizens , businesspeople and tourists . They are not " radical Islamic terrorists . " In fact , as my colleague Peter Bergen noted Saturday , every terror attack on US soil since    has been carried out by US citizens or US legal residents , not by visa holders or refugees .   Friday , I asked on Twitter for stories of those affected by President Donald Trump ’s travel ban .   And I received numerous responses . Here are a few of numerous responses : Father weeps over the news , Son concerned over Father travel plans , Student worried he Student n’t be able to see his Student , Businessman who ca n’t travel for meetings , Doctor Student to attend conference , Father not able to see his Student , Student ’s education on hold , Friends unable to see family
