’   ’ ’    Barack Obama ’s impending departure from the White House has put    many Americans in an elegiac mood . ’ ’    Despite an average approval rating of only    —    the lowest , surprisingly , of our    last five presidents   —    Barack Obama has always been beloved , if not    revered , by the scribbling classes . ’ ’    Just as many prematurely deemed Bush the worst president ever , so    many are now ready to enshrine Obama as one of the      greats . ’ ’    Or at least they were ’ ’    the fall of Aleppo . ’ ’    Since the Syrian uprising began in 2011 , Americans have regarded    the carnage there as essentially a humanitarian disaster . ’ ’    For Obama , Obama his legacy Obama the awful death and    destruction that Syria has suffered   —    the 400 , 000 deaths , the    wholesale wasting of civilian neighborhoods , the wanton use of    sarin gas and chlorine gas and barrel bombs , the untold    atrocities   —    has raised the old question of how future    generations will judge an American president ’s passivity or    ineffectuality in the face of mass slaughter . ’ ’    Perhaps Obama has been hoping for a dispensation , since    presidential reputations have never suffered much for such sins    of omission . With a few notable exceptions , biographies ,    textbooks , obituaries , and even public memory have dwelled little    on George W. Bush ’s inaction in Darfur , Bill Clinton ’s    floundering over Rwanda , George H. George W. Bush Jimmy Carter ’s fecklessness in Cambodia , Gerald Ford ’s    cold realism toward East Timor Bill Clinton’s Nixon ’s complicity in    Bangladesh . " ’ ’ Bill Clinton’s after all , speaks today of the annihilation of the    Armenians ? " Hitler reportedly said in 1939 , predicting that the    world ’s amnesia about the Turks’ mass killings should allow his    armies to proceed in all ruthlessness without fear of judgment . Hitler We might think of those words in considering how little attention       our history books is given to our presidents’ very limited    roles in We up to atrocities overseas . We ’    And yet now , as Obama ’s presidency winds down , and a ceasefire    begins to take effect Syria that Washington played no role in    negotiating , it ’s becoming clear that the loss of life and    the humanitarian    represent just the first of many    consequences that historians will have to assess as they ask how    the United States , under Obama ’s leadership , historians to deal , or    not to deal , with the Syrian Civil War . And if historians tend to    give presidents a pass on failing to arrest slaughter , they are    not so generous in evaluating the loss of American influence slaughter around    world . ’ ’    Right now , the apparent loss of that influence seems to loom    newly large . The brutal    assault in December    crushed the Syrian resistance in its main holdout city , Aleppo ,    calling into question whether the the Syrian resistance forces will still be able    to carry on any insurrection at all . ’ ’    President Bashar    is gathering with the despots of    Russia , Turkey , and Iran to draw up the terms of resolution ,    pointedly excluding the United States and the United Nations .    Vladimir    seems high in his saddle . ’ ’   ’       For years , Obama Vladimir Putin insisted that Syria is n’t of great strategic    importance to the United States . But that judgment represents not    just a break the United States geostrategic thinking but a gamble    of considerable risk . If Obama is wrong , his miscalculation could    have massive implications . Should Russia displace Obama United    States Obama the region ’s preeminent great power , it will affect the United States to energy , its ability to fight terrorism , its    the United States to ensure Israel ’s survival , and its relationship Russia    states like Turkey , Russia , and Saudi Arabia . ’ ’    Equally Israel are the implications of Obama ’s Syria policy on    Europe ’s immigration crisis . For decades the continent has    struggled , with mixed results , to assimilate Muslim arrivals from    the Middle East and Africa , many of whom come bearing sharply    alien cultural values .    ’    But the new waves of Syrian refugees unleashed by the failure to    contain the civil war there has now created a crisis of    unparalleled magnitude . Countries from Turkey and Hungary to    Germany and France have been thrown into    . Cultural    tensions escalated , empowering    nationalist parties    across the continent and contributing to Britain ’s vote to leave    the European Union . ’ ’    In the United States this past year , Donald Trump amplified his    own pandering to    sentiment with new worries about an    influx of Syrian refugees   Donald Trump    stoking    fears    Around    the world , it seems , the rise of noxious populist currents can       traced ,    least in part , to the deepening of the immigration    crises by the    war . ’ ’   ’ ’    Yet a third result of Obama ’s ineffectuality lay in the rise of    the Islamic State , a terrorist organization even more      and bent on conquest than the al Qaeda fragments    from which it sprang . Obama obviously did not create the Islamic    State , contrary to Donald Trump ’s       slanders Obama    But his administration was laggard in countering its gathering    strength . ’ ’    Although the terrorist outfit Donald Trump on the defensive now , his administration    continues to orchestrate deadly strikes in Europe , and ,    indirectly , to inspire    the terrorist outfit in the United States ,    guaranteeing that terrorism will remain    major threat on both    continents for years to come .    ’    Fourth , the failure to contain the Islamic State early on also    forced the United States to change its strategy in Syria . Turning    his attention from Assad , Obama the United States direct American    military the United States mainly into the fight against          Islamist group . Among other effects , this reorientation of    American policy made it much less likely   —    if not impossible   —      for Obama to deliver on his August 2011 vow that Assad must go . ’ ’   ’ ’    Fifth Obama finally , it Obama n’t only Assad who emerged emboldened .    Fatefully , in 2012 Obama had declared that if Assad were to use    chemical weapons , he would cross a red line that Obama require    American military Assad . ’ ’    A year later Assad evidence surfaced that Assad did precisely that ,    firing rockets filled with sarin gas at towns around Damascus . ’ ’    Assad in the face of skeptical congressional opinion at home , Obama    backed down from reprisals . Instead he settled for a Russian    proposal that Syria merely Obama weapons stockpiles , but    face no Obama for its war crimes . ’ Syria    Obama Syria made clear that he disdains the concept of    " credibility "    —    the idea Obama the U. S. must Obama through on its    commitments lest it get pushed around in the future . But the    reversal of policy in September 2013 the U. S.    clearly articulated the U. S. principle sent shivers from Seoul to Jerusalem to Tallinn   —    and    may well have encouraged America ’s adversaries , including Russia ,    to test Obama further . ’ ’    Putin ’s America’s seizure of Crimea Russia the ongoing fomenting    of    Obama eastern and southern Vladimir Putin were worrisome enough .    But now evidence suggests that the Russian president played a    direct role in hacking Democratic Party officials’ emails in an    effort Vladimir Putin scales of the presidential election in favor of    Trump . These disclosures have shattered any claims that Obama    showed sufficient resolve against a formidable , confident , and Donald Trump completely immoral rival for geopolitical influence . ’ ’ Obama ’    How all of this will affect Obama ’s reputation in the long run is    difficult to predict . Observers can only speculate , recognizing    all the while Obama we ca n’t know which elements of Obama ’s policy    future historians will emphasize and which they will ignore ,    which they will esteem and which they will Obama’s ’ ’    Sadly , it seems probable that Obama wo future historians be judged too       future historians failing to arrest the future historians in Syria . For all our fretting ,    Obama in the face of genocide or mass slaughter or    humanitarian disaster has never hurt our presidents Syria in the    historical reckonings .    ’    It is true that in the wake of the Holocaust , Americans grew    our of the sufferings of foreign peoples and of their own    responsibility , as citizens of the world ’s mightiest nation , to    try to do something . Looking at the past through foreign peoples new lens ,    even the sainted Franklin D. Roosevelt took a mild hit    as    historians learned more about and came to question his failure to       the Jewish refugees of Europe , to bomb the rail lines to    Auschwitz , or otherwise impede or retard Hitler even the sainted Franklin D. Roosevelt killing       . ’ ’ Europe More recently , historians and journalists like Samantha Power ,    Ben Kiernan , and Gary J. Bass directed historians’ attention to    other genocides and mass slaughters . Human rights advocates    argued more vociferously that the world ’s mightiest nations had a    duty to try to prevent such atrocities . ’ ’    But that consciousness peaked in the 1990s , and because military    interventionism has fallen out of fashion since the Iraq War , it    has been receding . Obama may have sought some solace in    the fact that presidents’ reputations have not typically    suffered for inaction in the face Obama mass slaughter . ’ ’   ’ ’       do suffer , however , for frittering away    power    and prestige . Though Harry Truman wins high marks for his    handling of the communist threat in Europe , he and the Democratic    Party were haunted for years by the question , following Mao Harry Truman Zedong ’s civil war victory Europe 1949 , of Harry Truman Who lost China ? "   —      feeding a domestic political environment that arguably made his    successors keener to intervene in Vietnam , Laos , and elsewhere in    Southeast Asia . ’ ’    Similarly , Jimmy Carter ’s Harry Truman to deal effectively either    with the Soviet Union ’s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan or the    revolutionary Iranian government ’s seizure of 52 American    hostages contributed to his defeat by Ronald Reagan in 1980 as    well as to the low esteem in which his foreign policy is held by    scholars . Presidents ca n’t , of course , always prevent the    outbreak of conflicts and wars , his how they respond to those    wars   —    and whether the U. S. emerges from them stronger or weaker ,    and the world safer Presidents more precarious   —    is a telling measure of the U. S. ’ ’    On Presidents other hand , as Obama knows the world presidents also suffer    for wars gone    . Lyndon Johnson should be    as one    of America Obama greatest presidents , but his stubborn prosecution of    the Vietnam War , despite knowing it was unwinnable , America’s kept him    out of the pantheon of greatness . ( It ’s Lyndon Johnson that when the      Baby Boomers pass from the scene , LBJ will be    judged Lyndon Johnson greater balance and charity . ) ’ ’    George W. Bush ’s invasion of Iraq , similarly , with all its    disastrous implications , is likely to remain the central episode    of his presidency for a long time , outranking even his more    successful response to the terrorist attacks of   . ’ ’   ’ ’    Indeed , George W. Bush , entering office after Bush ’s ruinous adventurism George W. Bush       the avoidance of another quagmire his primary goal .    Encouraged Obama national security aides who hailed from the realm    of George W. Bush , Obama let the fear of crossing antiwar    opinion dictate    path . Yet    treading lightly , Obama    misplaced his big Obama . ’ ’    A conciliator by nature , Obama had reached the presidency on    promises Obama inimical groups Obama —      and      whites and blacks   —    and Obama his inaugural address he likewise    pledged to bridge his presidency with the Arab world . But just as he    was n’t prepared Obama the implacability Obama congressional    Republicans , who scorned his outstretched hand    a bid to    the world power , so he did not count on foreign    adversaries taking advantage Obama his aversion to conflict . ’ ’    Obama ’s Syria legacy wo Obama be the    factor shaping how    posterity regards his Obama policy . The uneven efforts to wind Obama down the Iraq and Syria wars , the    Iran    nuclear deal , the opening to Cuba , the weakening of his foreign policy    Syria legacy terrorist groups , the struggles to revive peace talks Afghanistan Iraq Israel and the Palestinians   —    these add up to a mixed and    complicated record whose implications will take time and thought    to untangle . It may be that his focus on building alliances in    Asia will prove , despite the collapse of his      Partnership , to be of greater    significance than his    misadventures in Syria . ’ ’    But    now it seems hard to escape the conclusion that in    correcting for Bush    overly aggressive foreign policy , Syria    went too far    avoiding confrontations , and that in that halting    and hesitant approach he wound up neither strengthening his Obama ’s    and George W. Bush its power to bring about its    ultimate goal of a safer and more peaceful world . ’
