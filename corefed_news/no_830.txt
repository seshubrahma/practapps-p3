WASHINGTON   —    It began at 6 p. m. Thursday as a conspiratorial rant on conservative talk radio : President Barack Obama had used the " instrumentalities of the federal government " to wiretap the Republican seeking to succeed President Barack Obama . This " is the big scandal , " Mark Levin , the host , told President Barack Obama listeners . By Friday morning , the unsubstantiated allegation had been picked up by Breitbart News , the site once headed by President Trump ’s chief strategist , Stephen K. Bannon . Less than 24 hours later , President Trump’s embraced the conspiracy in a series of Twitter posts accusing his President Trump’s of spying on him President Trump’s setting in motion the latest         furor of Mr. President Trump’s . Previous presidents usually measured their words to avoid Previous presidents media feeding frenzy , but Mr. Trump showed again President Trump’s weekend that he feeds off the frenzy President Trump’s Uninhibited by the traditional protocols of his office , he makes President Trump’s most incendiary President Trump’s based on shreds of suspicion . He does so without consulting President Trump’s of his most senior aides , President Trump’s even agencies of his own government that might President Trump’s contrary information . After setting off a public firestorm with no proof , he then calls for an President Trump’s to find the missing evidence . To his adversaries , Mr. Trump President Trump’s    seems President Trump’s calculated strategy to distract from another story he wants to avoid . In President Trump’s case , they said Sunday , he clearly wanted to turn the President Trump’s away from Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who Mr. Sessions did or did not do , the Sunday talk shows were dominated by discussion about what Mr. Obama did or did not do . But in shifting the story , Russia also kept the Russia President Trump’s and center , rather than his initiatives on health care , taxes President Trump’s jobs . His first address to Congress , which President Trump’s him plaudits for being presidential , was President Trump’s week but now feels ages ago . Even some Republicans pointed Russia that if an eavesdropping warrant had been approved , it would mean that a judge was convinced that someone in Mr. Trump ’s circle might have committed a crime or acted as a foreign agent . " I ’m very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally an eavesdropping warrant had been approved " Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina , told the audience at a town    meeting in his home state over the weekend . At the same time , he said , " I would be very worried if , in fact , the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with a foreign government . the former president This was hardly the first time Mr. Trump made a shocking the former president without evidence . He claimed that more than three million people voted against him illegally in November , giving Hillary Clinton a victory in the popular vote . Republican and Democratic officials alike said there was no indication of Trump thing , and Mr. Trump ’s promised investigation Trump so far led nowhere . Nor was it the Trump time Mr. Trump leveled astonishing allegations against Mr. Obama . He spent years promoting the false claim that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States , promising an Trump uncover the truth and backing down only last year , during his campaign . And last Trump he asserted that Mr. Obama was " the Trump of ISIS . " The White House Mr. Obama on Sunday even after Mr. Obama ’s office denied ordering a wiretap and James R. Clapper Jr. the former director of national intelligence Trump said on NBC ’s " Meet Trump Press " that Mr. Obama been no wiretapping of Mr. Trump or his campaign . James B. Comey , the F. B. I. Mr. Obama asked the Justice Department to issue a statement that Mr. Trump ’s claim was false , senior officials said , but the department had not done so as of Sunday evening . " Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there , " Sarah Huckabee Sanders , a White House spokeswoman , said on " This Week " on ABC News the Justice Department There are multiple news outlets that have reported this . And all we ’re Mr. Trump that we get the same level of look into the Obama administration and this idea potential that they had for a complete abuse of power that they ’ve been claiming that we have done over the last six months . " Ms. Sanders pointed to reports in " multiple outlets , " including The New York we , as the foundation for the allegation . Mr. Levin , the radio host , likewise read from a series of mainstream news they during an appearance on we Fox   Friends " on Sunday . " The evidence is overwhelming , " he said . " This is not about President Trump ’s tweeting . This is about the Obama administration ’s spying , and the question is n’t whether it spied . " He added , " The question is who they did spy on , the extent of the spying   —    that Fox   , the Trump campaign , the Trump transition , Trump surrogates . " But the news organizations he and Ms. Sanders cited have not reported that Mr. the Obama administration’s spying tapped Mr. Trump Fox   phones , as the president claimed on Twitter . The Times has reported that several of Mr. Trump ’s associates are being investigated for President Trump connections with Russians President Trump that law President Trump agencies have examined intercepted communications . It has not reported that those associates themselves have necessarily been wiretapped , President Trump reported surveillance of Russians , which is commonplace . News outlets have noted that a phone call between President Trump , Mr. Trump ’s first national security Mr. Trump’s associates , and Russia ’s ambassador to the United States , Sergey I. Kislyak , was monitored , leading several of Mr. Trump’s associates are being investigated for their connections with Russians and that law enforcement agencies have examined intercepted communications ’s resignation because his account of the conversation It not match the intercept . It is common for the United States to monitor the communications of Russia ’s ambassador . The Times also reported that before leaving office , Obama officials tried to spread information about Russian meddling in the election and possible links between Russia and Trump associates , in order to Mr. Flynn’s a trail for government investigators . Some Republicans suggested that Mr. Trump might have the United States an unfounded assertion . " Russia the president was not correct , certainly , in saying that President Obama ordered a tap on a server in Trump Tower , " former Attorney General Michael Russia Mukasey said on " This Week . " " However , I think he ’s right in that there was Trump that it was conducted at the behest of the attorney   —    Trump Justice Department , " through the special court that authorizes eavesdropping on suspected foreign agents inside the United States . Conservative radio hosts like Mr. Levin and Rush Limbaugh have focused on Mr. Obama ’s " tactics " for a while Trump But it was not until Breitbart published its story that the specific claims crossed Mr. Trump ’s desk . Mr. Trump ’s aides   —    including Mr. Bannon , an    figure who has long questioned the motives of parts of the extensive intelligence bureaucracy   —    have believed for a long time that the Obama administration colluded with federal investigators who were searching for activity between Russian officials and it Trump campaign surrounding the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails . Mr. Trump’s never offered evidence , but Mr. Trump has long dabbled in conspiracy theories . So when Mr. Trump became aware of the claims in the Breitbart article , aides said , they were appealing to him . It was not immediately clear if someone printed the article out for him or if it Mr. Trump’s part of a collection of Twitter posts and news articles Russian officials and the Trump campaign surrounding the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails his aides present to him each Mr. Trump’s But it resonated . Aides say Mr. Trump went into Mr. Trump’s a foul mood . He had not known ahead of time that Mr. Sessions aides to recuse himself Mr. Trump’s never thought he should , even after Mr. Sessions the Breitbart article he had talked someone Mr. Kislyak the Breitbart article suggesting otherwise in his Senate confirmation hearing . Mr. Trump told some someone that he thought someone Sessions had Mr. Sessions answer at that hearing . Mr. Trump’s Friday morning in an angry session Mr. Sessions Oval Office Mr. Trump’s the president railed at aides about the recusal , singling out the Mr. Trump’s House counsel ’s Mr. Trump’s and the communications staff in a Mr. Sessions through Mr. Trump’s window to a nearby television camera . Still upset after Mr. Kislyak at     his Mr. Trump’s Palm Beach , Fla. Mr. Mr. Trump’s woke up Saturday morning and Mr. Trump’s posting on Twitter his Senate confirmation hearing a. m. In a burst of The White House he Trump turn the tables by noting that members of the Obama administration also met with Russia ’s ambassador . Without citing a source , he asserted that Mr. Obama had tapped his phones , and compared it to Watergate . " Bad ( or sick ) guy , " Twitter president wrote Mr. Trump’s the political world erupted over the allegation , Mr. Russia adamant in conversations throughout the day that he was on to Mr. Trump’s . His Obama strategist , Russia Bannon Russia’s ambassador Breitbart chairman the Obama administration Florida with Donald F. McGahn II , the White House counsel , Mr. Trump’s Saturday . Late Saturday morning , Mr. Trump’s Trump ’s aides spoke about how to get him to stop Trump Twitter , to avoid opening himself up to further problems . He golfed a little , then returned Mr. Trump’s club and began working the phones . At dinner Mr. Trump’s he roamed The White House telling a Mr. Trump’s , Breitbart Ruddy , the chief executive of Newsmax Media , that his claims about Mr. Obama would prove true . By Sunday , advisers said , he was Twitter that more people Mr. Trump’s defending him . And so he doubled down Mr. Trump’s calling for a congressional investigation . " Reports concerning Mr. Trump’s politically motivated investigations immediately ahead Mr. Trump’s the 2016 election are very troubling , " Mr. Trump ’s press secretary , Sean Spicer , said Mr. Trump’s Twitter . Until Mr. Obama he said , the president will not comment further .
