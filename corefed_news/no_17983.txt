’   ’ ’    We were reminded this week that president Donald Trump likes president Donald Trump    steaks cooked    and smothered in ketchup . ’ ’    On its own , this piece of information matters little —   who cares    why one man wants to turn lovely $ 54 cuts into    rubbery    hunks of protein ? ’ ’    But as with most minor    quirks that become internet      the reactions to Trump ’s steak preference say a lot    more than the preference itself —   especially about the bizarre way    meat ,    varying degrees of bloodiness , and masculinity are    mixed up in America . ’ "    Plenty of outlets have condemned Trump’s choice in meat    preparation in the year since that personal detail first came    out . The Huffington Post called it The Huffington Post the worst possible way " to       a steak last March ; earlier this week , Jezebel claimed the    practice made the president seem " like a damn child . "    Preemptively heading off readers who might dismiss a steak hot    take as distracting from politics and policies that matter , Eater    contended that " Actually , How Donald Trump Eats His Donald Trump Eats    Matters , " then spent nearly 1 , 800 words explaining what    consumption of certain kinds of meat can reveal about a person ’s    ability to trust others and take advice . " ’    In response , some      # MAGA people have done    what they people best : react to something silly with      extremism and    insults . ’ ’    " Only men with testosterone deficiencies order their Only men with testosterone deficiencies    anything less than burnt to a crisp , " tweeted an InfoWars editor ,       that progressives need a " trigger warning " for the    " traumatizing " content of a photo of Trump nomming on a golden    fork . Someone on the    subreddit joked ( ? ) that    " satanists and pedophiles like their meat raw , " so it " makes       that Trump Trump like his Trump done . " ’ ’    This sudden love among    for brown , shriveled discs    of flesh was the subject of a nice comic from Matt Bors at the    Nib . " Flavor is for cucks . I burn my steaks now , " says the    strip ’s Trump Trump , who cuts his Trump with a chainsaw . " We are    owning libs so hard with our We eating . Hashtag # welldone . " ’ ’    The defense of a    steak in communities that normally go    to great lengths to defend the purity of their masculinity is a    wonder to behold . ‘ Twasn’t but a short time ago that the rare    steak , close as it is to the animal in its the animal , hunted form , was    the thing men were supposed to eat . While writers critique    Trump ’s preferred meat treatment for its Trump on flavor and    texture , people on Twitter are questioning his Trump : " No real    man would have voted for Trump Trump they people on Twitter known he No real   man steak    ‘ well done with ketchup,’ " one man tweeted . Another user cast    doubt on the idea that Trump Trump be " a real man ’s man " with    that kind of taste , calling him ’s man" with    "    " who ’d be better    off eating chicken . ’ ’   ’ ’    But I ’m a vegetarian snowflake with a bias against hegemonic    masculinity , so maybe I do n’t know what I ’m ’m about ?    Internet research brought me to this thread on a forum called    " Dawg Shed " —   a site manly enough to have a section called the    " hoochie bin " —   that wondered " When it comes to steak , what is the    most manly level of doneness ? " ’ "    Lots of men voted for rare or    but one called them   Lots of men    " bunch of       that think it ’s manly to eat raw meat . " He    continued : " You know nothing about flavor      . " One user with    a    ’84 avatar ( two men ! ) offered that " my buddy claims    real men eat their real men well done . " Since    talking to      about what " real men " do constitutes the closest    thing the world has to actual gender police , I ’m inclined to       that there may be some grain of truth here . " ’    Then again , Hollywood has done a pretty thorough job of    synonymizing    with rare meat . John Travolta as Vincent    Vega in Pulp Fiction gets his John Travolta as Vincent   Vega in Pulp Fiction " bloody as hell " ; Raging Bull    finds Robert De Niro yelling and shoving his Robert De Niro wife for    overcooking his Robert De Niro of meat . ’ ’    In what might be the most extreme example , The Cowboy    Way , uncouth country boys Kiefer Sutherland and Woody    Harrelson order red wine with ice and marvel at " "    lemon slices at a fancy restaurant . When the server asks    Harrelson how he   Harrelson like his   Harrelson cooked , he   Harrelson the chef to    " just knock its the chef off , wipe its the chef ol’     and chunk it its nasty ol’     right down on the plate . " The trope of a violent    eater    is so common in popular cinema , Roger Ebert ’s Movie Yearbook 2005    contained this observation from a contributor : " When characters    order steaks , they always ask for ‘ rare,’ which people hardly    ever order in restaurants , instead of ‘ medium rare’ or ‘ medium,’    which is what most people order . This is because the kind of    character who orders a steak in a movie would sound like a wimp    asking for ‘ medium . ’ " ’ ’   ’ ’    No matter how it ’s cooked , meat —   especially red meat —   is one of the    most heavily gendered foods on the pyramid . Multiple studies have    shown that people associate meat with men and vegetables with    women , and    steak ranks above hamburgers and      steak in measures of masculinity . ’ ’    " To the strong , traditional , macho ,        male , red meat is a strong , traditional , macho ,        food , " the authors of one study    wrote . The connotation spans borders : In Ethiopia , eating raw    meat is a " male thing " manly men do together , and most languages    with gendered pronouns put meat in the masculine camp . Someone    who engages in     consumption of meat is signaling that    he Someone   who engages in    consumption of meat n’t care about his Someone   who engages in    consumption of meat or the planet , and not caring       harming things is one of the most important elements of       masculinity . Men are less likely to do things    perceived as    like eat vegetarian , lest they Men    confused for women . ’ ’    Lucky for you , reader , German newsmagazine Der Spiegel gave us a    prime example of just such a conspicuous meat consumer this week .    A profile of Alex Jones , the walking aneurysm who heads up    InfoWars , describes the guy sweating in a    room , heaping    barbecued meats onto a plate , and removing his shirt in front of       reporter before sitting down next to a case of Italian    mineral water and beginning his   the reporter . ’ ’    " With his   the reporter torso , he   the reporter there and shovels meat into his   the reporter mouth , a caricature of manliness , but also a show of power to the    reporter sitting in front of him   the reporter He   the reporter do as he   the reporter , "    reporter Veit Medick writes . " Then Jones   the reporter up and holds out a    sausage . ‘ Wanna suck?’ he ‘ . " ’ ’    The only thing men who doth protest too much about their The only thing men who doth manliness love more than showing off how much they The only thing men who doth meat is       meat into sexual metaphors . See : the sensual      ads of " " steakhouses that want to use salads and    small portions to attract sexy women , then use sexy women to    attract men . ’ "    Trump Trump lack the     approach to          of a real stud like Beauty and the Beast ’s Gaston , who eats    60 raw eggs a day , but his Trump steak scenario tells some    people that he Trump just like them some   people a regular guy with no    sophisticated taste for anything that ca n’t be found in a bottle    at Safeway . On    resident intellectual    " autisticlibtardcuck " posited that " 90 % of HollyWood Hollywood their 90% of HollyWood palette is too fine for such a condiment " as ketchup , while    " POTUS and Billionaire eating like the working class people he    loves so dearly . Keep killing it    President , I want 8 years of       . " In a rare case of Hollywood Hollywood the    appeal    of beef that ’s been cooked all the way through —   a typical way of    preparing lesser cuts of meat —   Goodfellas shows Johnny Dio cooking    steaks in prison , mocking another guy as an " aristocrat " for    ordering his   . " ’    Okay , so in the eyes of some supporters , Trump Trump up for his Trump loss in man points with a boost in     points by eating      with Heinz . Those attentive calculators of      propriety may want to check out Manly Health and Training : To    Teach the Science of a Sound and Beautiful Body , a new collection    of writing by America ’s foremost populist of poetry , Walt    Whitman . Under a pen name , Whitman Walt   Whitman in these      essays that men should be bearded carnivores . ’ ’    But more than that , to reach the heights of masculine splendor    achieved by the "    " Greeks , Whitman Walt   Whitman , men should eat " fresh rare lean meat " for breakfast and    " fresh meat ( rare lean beef , broiled or roast , is best ) with as    few outside condiments as possible " for lunch . Of all the      evaluators of masculinity mentioned here , I trust    Whitman the most , for one admittedly   . C. reason : He was gay . ’ ’We were reminded this this week president Mr. President ’ ’’ ’’ ’’
