" ’ ’    Trump seems intent on mounting    deportations , sending    many people back to Mexico . In Mexico , government officials are    preparing for that influx . ’ ’    Already , there has been " a meeting between federal and state    authorities to deal in terms of developing a strategy on how    they’’re going to handle the proposed Trump deportation into    Mexico , " Mike Vigil , a former chief of international operations    for the US Drug Enforcement Administration , told Business    Insider , citing conversations he’’d had with a Mexican security    official . ’ "    Trump ’s dealings with Mexico have been fraught , and some have    speculated deportation will proceed similarly . " ’   ’ ’    " In an environment ot tension between both countries ,    deportations probably won’’t happen in the framework of orderly    repatriation programs , " Mexican security analyst     magazine    Zeta in November . ’ "    While US and Mexican officials have met , reportedly   it ’s not known    if US and Mexican officials addressed deportations . " "    In spite of that lack of among Mexican officials , US and Mexican officials reportedly    have a plan for how US and Mexican officials ’ll handle the arrivals . " ’    Mexican officials are " of the opinion that Trump also wants to    send individuals that were born Central American through Mexico ,    and ’   Mexican officials opposed that , " said Vigil , author of " . " ’ ’    " ’   Mexican officials want the United States to fly ’   Mexican officials or do whatever ’   Mexican officials have    to do , but ’   Mexican officials don’’t want ’   Mexican officials going into or through Mexico , " don’’t    said , adding : ’ ’      " The other thing that ’   Mexican officials plan on doing is that once these      individuals are deported into Mexico they’’ll concentrate these     individuals      on the border for about three days , and then from there they’’ll      bus these     individuals to these     individuals respective states so that they’’re not all      just en masse along the border , because that would aggravate      the situation . "    ’ ’      " And then each state would be responsible for trying to get all      of these individuals jobs . That way all of these deportations      are not concentrated along the border states , but dispersed      throughout all the Mexican states , depending on where they these deportations           from . "    ’ ’    The Mexican government appears to have already put something like       plan into action . ’ ’   ’ ’    When those   in Mexico City on       , President Enrique Peña Nieto told them those  in Mexico City were job    opportunities in Mexico . Each of the returnees was given a    backpack with a repatriation letter , a phone card , and a bus    ticket . ’ ’    The effort to move deportees around the country in a orderly    fashion likely comes out of a concern over security as much as    one for human rights . ’ "    The US government sent a considerable number of people back to    Central America in the 1990s and 2000s , and that sudden influx to    weak states emerging from civil wars   to transnational    gangs and to the region ’s current instability . " ’    A large population with few roots in Mexico and dim prospects for       could , as in Central America in the 1990s , feed the ranks of       organizations   in some parts of    Mexico Mexico ’ ’    " They want to disperse it   work " Vigil said , " so that it’ ’s not like    all of a sudden Chihuahua or Baja California norte is saddled    with all these mass deportations . " ’ ’   ’ "    While the Mexican government may be able to transport deportees    around the country , finding them steady employment is going to be    more difficult . The the Mexican government struggled to create    jobs for people    already in the country , and the country recent    weak economic performance will    make that a    challenge going forward . " "    The relative purchasing power of Mexican salaries   a trend    exacerbated by the peso ’s lackluster performance over the last    few months . One of the deportees who arrived in the country this    week the country that creating jobs was not    enough   —    the salaries needed to go up too . " ’    " It’ ’s still unclear as to what resources they’’re going to put    forth , " Vigil said of the federal government’ ’s plan . " But I think    that they’’ll try to get a lot of jobs , primarily agricultural    jobs , at least that’ ’s what the focus is right now . " ’ "    In the wake of Rayos’ sudden deportation , the Mexican government    also warned Mexican citizens still in the US . " ’   ’ ’    " The case involving Mrs. Garcia de Rayos illustrates a new    reality for the Mexican community living in the United States ,    facing the most severe implementation    immigration control    measures , " Mexico’ ’s    Ministry said in a statement on    Friday . ’ ’       deportation prompted the Mexican foreign minister     government to respect due    process and human rights during the deportation process , which    the ministry reiterated in its statement Foreign Ministry ’    Mexican Foreign Ministry " have intensified their work of protecting    fellow nationals ’ ’   Mexican consulates foreseeing more severe immigration measures to    be implemented by the authorities of this country , and possible    violations Mexican precepts during such operations       problems with due process . " ’       Despite the   of some members of the    Trump administration with officials in the Peña Nieto government the Mexican government do n’t seem to be on the same page on most issues . " ’    " I don’’t think that the The US government really thought this    out , " Vigil said . Vigil They have to The US government much better coordination    than they’’re having with the The Mexican government " ’ ’    " How many people are deported is going to play a very key role , "    he said , " because if they don’’t have the jobs to satisfy all of    these individuals , all it’ How many people going to do it’ feed the ranks of    these cartels , which will then expand their territory throughout    Mexico , " Mexico   Mexico " And , again , that How many people be a disastrous    situation for    Mexico and the United States .
