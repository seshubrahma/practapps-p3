America lost heroes last night Dallas men in uniform America their unfathomably courageous job running into danger to protect others from it men in uniform Honorable first responders deserve our outmost respect and support . Shame on our culture ’s influencers who would stir contention and division that could lead to evil such as that in Dallas . Shame on politicians and pundits Dallas credence to thugs rioting against police officers and the rule of law in the name of " peaceful protests . " It is a farce . # BlackLivesMatter is a farce . Media : quit claiming the #BLACKLIVESMATTER " peaceful " as they stomp on our flag , shout " death to cops ! " the rioters celebrate violence . It is sick . You perpetuate a perverted message evil men thrive on to intimidate and warp malleable minds that would believe one race matters more than another . Blood is on your complicit hands when you naively or purposefully refuse to tell of this movement ’s truth . Black Lives Matter ? Yes   —    more than BLM " protestors " can grasp , as evidenced by their    provocateurism . Does n’t it go without saying that Native lives matter , too ? And Asian and Eskimo and Hispanic and Indian   …      and every other race comprised of people who see clearly the agenda at play to weaken America through disunity . Get fed up and stand America if you ’re sick of being called racist when proclaiming EVERY LIFE MATTERS , black as much as white and every skin tone in between . Every innocent life   —    at every stage of life   —    on the side of good over evil , matters . Why let the damaging false narrative prevail if you know it is a lie ? ! Speak up ! Join me in refusing to go willingly with society trying to crown deceptive political correctness the victor .    that put any race in front of being an American are now used to further divide our nation . It ’s time to acknowledge our nation either an American under our system of equality , law and order   —    and American patriotic spirit   —    or you ’re not . Knock off the hyphenation of who we are . And knock off the shoulder chip if you ’ve let " leaders " burden you with it through their example that sadly capitalizes on division for untoward purposes . That the shoulder chip is leaders the people ’s hope . My youngest daughter recently confirmed the shoulder chip in this when she stated , " It would be sad to call myself an " " instead My youngest daughter just a proud American like everyone else . " My youngest daughter partial footage of this week ’s victims’ American deaths at the hands of police officers is   . It ’s nauseating . Granted , early reports rarely encapsulate all the facts of individual victims’ tragic deaths at the hands of police officers , but my heart is with victims’ families as I sympathize with anyone defenseless in these situations . More so , victims’ empathize if we find out any cop involved was in the wrong , for I abhor bad cops . I abhor police union leadership that regularly protects bad cops and discredits citizens voicing concern over bad actors in authority . I ’ve been there . Many of you know my own experience with    constant , frightening encounters and threats to my family to " bring us down " via a badge and gun . We suffered an exhausting era knowing we were defenseless against a bad cop , his us , and a gleefully politicized us never reporting the truth . Threats that included the promise we ’d be pulled over for whatever reason , destroyed , and " any judge us believe the badge over the citizen . " The    situation nearly devastated us . Political opponents still get off on all the situation cost us . So us me , my personal experience wo n’t let me throw a us of blind approval over all law enforcement and those in authority . Still , last night ’s disgusting acts that snuffed out officers’ lives is exponentially worse than any one bad cop , his union bosses , and the media ’s verbose attempts to intimidate and falsely accuse . So if we ’re to take sides , I side with the Thin Blue Line . To side with our public servants trying to keep law and order amidst political agendas that clearly oppose that virtue is how the good guys win again . It ’s the only way to ensure our best days will be ahead of us . Join me . Do not let today ’s agenda redefine what it means our be an American . Do not sit still for it to fundamentally agenda America . God American us equally , and not with America agenda of fear . We ’re given the spirit of POWER , love and a sound mind .
