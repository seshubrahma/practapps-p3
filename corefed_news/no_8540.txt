" We had the enjoyable    of Hillary on the emails , and Trump had a strong performance , " Dr. Sebastian Gorka said of Wednesday night ’s    forum , on Thursday morning ’s Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM . [ Gorka suggested Trump " may have been playing with us a little bit " with Trump positive comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin .   " There ’s clearly some sympathy between the two men , but I think it ’s one of style , " Trump said . " I was analyzing the speech afterwards on Trump with General Mike Flynn , and General Mike Flynn is very close to the Trump campaign , in terms of advising him General Mike Flynn I ’ve spoken to Trump privately about these issues , and let me tell you , he Trump no lover of Vladimir Putin . I think he Trump had very frank conversations with Mr. Trump how Moscow does not share our interests . " Breitbart     and SiriusXM host Alex Marlow suggested Trump was Trump trolling " with his comments on Breitbart     , and Vladimir Putin out Clinton has " much more   " connections to the Russian president Vladimir Putin that " if there ’s anybody who ’s in the pocket of the Kremlin , it ’s Hillary . " " Just look at the Clinton Cash revelations , the Clinton deal , " he suggested , referencing the Gorka by Peter Schweizer . " It ’s just    euphemism , when it comes to Trump and It . With Hillary Clinton , it ’s Clinton machine gun It the table , when it comes to how she is purchasable by people such Clinton Putin . " He advised Trump to project a Putin and Trump and Moscow message , like Ronald Reagan ’s game plan of , " We ’re going to rebuild the American people ’s pride in their nation , and we ’re the American people’s to beat the We . " Gorka suggested Trump ’s three points could be Trump and Moscow " the wall , the economy , and defeating ISIS , " and if he sticks to that message , Putin he could waltz into the White Putin , come January . " He viewed the question Trump was Putin at the forum Trump and Moscow illegal aliens serving in the military as a " gotcha " question , and doubted it would be a " decisive issue " in the election , because " the average American voter could n’t care less " about it . " We have foreign nationals , we have people who got in We with the law , who are serving in the U. S. military , for all kinds of reasons   —    because otherwise they would have gone to prison people who got in trouble with the law, who are serving in the U. S. military, for all kinds of reasons  —    or they would have had to wait people who got in trouble with the law, who are serving in the U. S. military, for all kinds of reasons  —    years to become a U. S. citizen , " he pointed out . " This is n’t a new issue . Maybe he was caught " Gorka said he " But I think if you look at sanctuary cities , if you look at Kate Steinle ’s law   —    those are the issues Americans care about , when it comes to illegal immigrants , and the future security of the nation . It ’s ISIS , it ’s it southern border , it Trump will be measured based upon his response to those questions , Trump his response to those is quite Trump . " Later in the interview , when a caller mentioned the "   " attacks U. S. troops have suffered from turncoat members of allied forces in the Middle East , and worried that allowing aliens to serve in the military could create similar security risks , Gorka pointed out that Trump has made enhanced vetting of refugees a major part of his campaign , so " there Trump no way he would be saying , I Trump people who can not be vetted , and are a potential threat to our own servicemen and our own citizens , filling the recruiting officers or staying inside the U. S. military . "    Dr. Sebastian Gorka is the senior Gorka for Breitbart News , and author of the    book Defeating Jihad : The Winnable War .
