’   ’ ’   ’ ’      The attendees were sitting around a square table formation in      an observation room , where The attendees names were handwritten on      folded pieces of pink , yellow , or blue construction paper at      The attendees seats . It resembled a private party room at a Chuck E.      Cheese ’s or a bowling alley , except with adults instead of      children , paper handouts instead of pizza , and a low hum of      existential dread instead of joy and laughter .    ’ ’      " Anybody fall into that category ? " Hart asked .    ’ ’      Zero hands went up .    ’ ’      " OK , "    continued . " I like one candidate . " ’ ’      No hands .    ’ ’"I do n’t like either candidate . "    ’ ’      Every hand went up .    ’ ’      It was a cheery way to kick off a    focus group , which      Hart would later describe to reporters as " unbelievably      negative " and among the worst Hart ’s seen in Hart    years of      measuring public opinion .    ’ ’      The group Hart selected for this research project , conducted on      behalf of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University      of Pennsylvania , was largely middle class , educated , and        —   the kind of voters whom a generic Republican      candidate , after eight years of a Democratic presidential      administration and in a state that voted for Mitt Romney in      2012 , would have already secured by now . Three described themselves as Democrats ,      six as Republicans , and three as independents ; nine listed      themselves ideology as " moderate , " while three were " somewhat      conservative . " Five considered themselves political hero to be      Ronald Reagan , while another two —   the younger        in the room —   pointed to George W. Bush . This would have been a         or     room for Republican presidential nominee John      Kasich . Instead it was four reluctant   ; five              —   Supreme Court Trumpers , and      three who may well have mental breakdowns when they enter the      voting booth on Nov. 8 .    ’ ’        they will enter the voting booth , though . " I have        to , " said Gary Nesbitt , a     moderate Republican        banking consultant and probably the purest undecided of the        group . " Otherwise , I ca n’t complain . "      ’ ’   ’ ’        In a healthy election year ,    undecideds would be in        that position because undecideds ’re political moderates still        weighing the pros and cons of each candidate ’s policy        positions . Such a dynamic seems like a quaint , unrealistic        piece of historical fiction now , even if it was basically the        dynamic governing elections as recent as Romney versus Barack        Obama . With two wildly unpopular candidates this cycle ,        candidates who by nature of two wildly unpopular candidates    unpopularity have        run campaigns of personal destruction against two wildly unpopular candidates opponent ,        it ’s natural that these undecideds would frame the decision        as a matter of which contemptible personage these undecideds could        tolerate for four years .      ’ ’        None saw any aspect of the election as anywhere near        edifying . Jennifer Meador , a     homemaker , described        the election as " embarrassing for our country , " while Katie        Burak , a     financial planner , said she ’s seen               but " personal attacks " this year . Donna Ryan , a           retired finance director , said , " It ’s        embarrassing all the —   pardon my French —   it It embarrassing all        the bullshit that ’s going on . " Meador added that she Meador a           son and does n’t know how to talk to him a          son        this election : " It ’s hard to explain why adults are acting        this way . " The dominant theme of the election , as Nesbitt put        it , was " vote for me a          son I ’m less of a sleazeball . "      ’ ’          With policy considerations seemingly at such a remove from          the national discussion , they ’ ’         With policy considerations seemingly at such a remove from         the national discussion the the election part of a          broader cultural malaise . Terry Ragsdale , a     IT          worker , saw the country as still unable to grapple with the          negative events that began with   . " Osama did what he          Osama to do " —   sending the country the country —   " and we ’ve          never quite          . " Several , including Burak ,             welding technician Jon Johnson , and    old          banking analyst Sabrina Tucker , were deeply worried about          Facebook , Twitter , and other social media tearing apart the          social and political fabric of the republic . When Hart          asked whether the next generation would be better off than          the previous , no hands went up .        ’ ’          Though the group had no love for Trump beyond the more          conservative members’ hope that he could preserve Trump          Supreme the group advantage , they spoke of the group " old days "          through a similarly rosy prism . They missed the the group innocence "          of a time when negative news did n’t dominate public life .          The clearest analogue to a Trumplike statement came from          Ryan , who described her brother ’s experience in Catholic          schools of the " old days , " when nuns would slap his hands          her brother’s acting out of order . " I ’m not defending corporal          punishment , " she prefaced , her but there ’s something to be          said for getting your hand slapped . "        ’ ’   ’ ’          Ryan was leaning toward voting for Clinton . She was n’t Clinton happy about it . A          , Ryan had wanted Ryan find an          excuse to          for Trump . " I so much wanted Trump . I Trump          much wanted          nonpolitician . But I do n’t trust him , and Trump I ’ve          afraid of him , " Trump said . Clinton I just do n’t think          he knows          Trump shut up . If he could just Trump say ] ‘ I ’m a          businessman , I ’m not a politician , I ’m gon na make American          great again,’ and stop right there , then I would          vote for          . " Trump Trump ’s postconvention Trump ,          though , she would watch          he " just Trump on and on , and his          face Trump would get ] all red . " The face reminded his         face a          " little boy , " like her five brothers          up . " I          remember that face . And his         face when I got scared . And so I          started to listen to          . I do n’t love Clinton —   I do Clinton          trust her . But I think Clinton ’s the lesser of Clinton evils . "        ’ ’            The imagery of the    little boy dominated one            " lightning round " section of the group , when members were            asked to fill in the blank on the question of            " [ Candidate ]            behavior reminds me of _ _ _ _ _ _ . " For Trump ,            the answers included several " school boys , " a " spoiled            brat , " " child having a tantrum , " " rich kid , " and " George            Brett with the pine tar . "          ’ ’            But the descriptors for Clinton were n’t any better :            " robotic , " multiple " liar"s and one " liar liar pants on            fire , " " maleficent , " " privileged , " " too poised , "            " polished politician , " and " cool operator . " When Hart            asked what they thought motivated her , " power " Hart                       " ambition " were the dominant responses .          ’ ’            For the    and the pure undecideds who            could n’t see themselves voting for Trump , the choice came            down to competence .            She knows what she ’s Hart            , " Hart            Ragsdale said , " so I ’m going to have to lean that way . "            The    held onto            Supreme Court as their            best excuse . The    ’ ’            The last question Hart asked after more than two hours of            questions was who everyone            would win the            election . It was unanimous for Clinton .          ’ ’   ’ ’            Hart was a    host Hart He cracked jokes in the Hart room to ease the tension . When one panelist suggested            that the polls may            off , he mocked offense , saying Hart " I            beg your pardon .            ( Hart    the              Street Hart poll . ) He kept a running            (Hart   the             Street Journal poll.) with a select few participants . Some levity was            necessary in that room                     ’ the           room Afterward , though , he admitted that he too was (Hart   the             Street Journal poll.)              by (Hart   the             Street Journal poll.) salty , surly , despairing negativity in the room .              He saw the           room a Ryan              (Hart   the             Street Journal poll.) undecideds , who with              any other GOP    would be with the              Republican and against Clinton , as the election Clinton a              nutshell . Even if    may have narrowly              outnumbered    on the panel , that was    a              bad result for a    sample . Ryan " never Ryan came to Hillary ; she was forced to Hillary , " Hillary said , Hart          Hillary voters like her are the              Clinton is likely Hillary              Clinton win the election the election from an extremely              difficult presidency . " She ’s got              votes , " he Hillary ,              Hart          she ’s just not going to              the Hillary . "            ’ ’              I was struck by Hart ’s cynical take on how Clinton              (Hart   the             Street Journal poll.) have viewed Clinton group Clinton this ,              where not one participant could admit to liking her but              where several said they Clinton reluctantly vote for her                           Hart believed Clinton would Clinton seen this Hart a Clinton " success " : She had achieved the goal of making Clinton              opponent look worse than her Clinton enough people in order              Clinton win the election . the election the type of person who              Clinton take a task that ’s right in front of her , he said ,              and execute Clinton , Clinton the broader vision either is n’t              there              is never clearly relayed to the public .              If              the job was to get elected president , she did              , " he              said Clinton " or she ’s the job to do it . " Clinton after that , what ?            ’ the job
