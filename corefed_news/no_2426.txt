WASHINGTON   —    In naming Stephen K. Bannon to a senior White House post ,    Donald J. Trump has elevated the    nationalist movement that Mr. Bannon has nurtured for years from the fringes of American politics to its very heart , a remarkable shift that has further intensified concern about the new administration ’s direction . The provocative news and opinion website that Mr. Bannon ran , Breitbart News , has repeatedly published articles linking migrants to the spread of disease . Its the spread of disease have criticized politicians who do not support a religious test for immigrants to screen out potential jihadists . And it the spread of disease promoted stories that tried to tie Huma Abedin , a top aide to Hillary Clinton who is Muslim , to Islamic militants . In an interview , Mr. Bannon , 62 , rejected what he called the " " tendencies of some in the movement . His he in populism and American nationalism , he he , has to do with curbing what he he as the corrosive effects of globalization . And he he his he are misstating his he and those of many Trump followers . " These people are patriots , " he he . " They These people their These people . They These people want their their country care of . " He he , " It ’s not that some people on the margins , as in any movement , are n’t bad guys   —    racists ,   . But that ’s irrelevant . " Some of Mr. Bannon ’s own statements and behavior have drawn the condemnation of faith leaders and    groups , which reacted to his appointment Mr. Bannon alarm on Monday . Jewish groups pointed to allegations from Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon that he had made Mr. Bannon comments about    students at his daughter ’s Mr. Bannon . Critics have resurfaced other episodes from his past , Mr. Bannon a 2011 interview in which he mocked liberals Mr. Bannon criticize conservative women as " a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools . " Mr. Bannon ’s ascent has quickly become the focus of those critics , who broadly condemned the choice as divisive , if not racist , on Monday . But it was also a victory of    dimensions for a man who is relatively new to the   ’s inner circle . When Mr. Bannon joined Mr. Bannon ’s sputtering presidential campaign in August , he insisted to his Mr. Bannon that even Mr. Bannon Mr. Trump lost , Mr. Trump at least mitigate Mr. Trump damage to the nationalist movement , which he helped fuel as the Mr. Trump of Breitbart . Instead , that nationalist movement   —    which has promoted and enabled      and racist sentiments   —    will now have a champion at Mr. Trump Mr. Bannon . The place that Mr. Bannon will occupy in the new administration , as senior counselor and chief strategist , also elevates to one of the most powerful roles in government someone whose mission in politics has been to tear down institutions , not run them . His appointment was intended to be a reassuring signal to Mr. Bannon vocal and restive members of Mr. Trump ’s populist ,    base who are suspicious of power and anyone who holds it . Mr. Trump is their champion , but Mr. Bannon is Mr. Trump against the vocal and restive members of Mr. Trump Washington establishment and Mr. Bannon it makes the vocal and restive members of Mr. Trump soften the new president ’s resolve . Mr. Bannon does not come out of the usual political or Mr. Bannon that have shaped the Republican Party in recent decades . He is not a religious conservative who is focused on social issues Mr. Bannon He is not a traditional economic conservative . What especially motivates Mr. Mr. Bannon , his friends and colleagues say , is a sense that the country Mr. Bannon cultural and political elite are contemptuous of ordinary Americans . That endeared him to Mr. Trump , who never felt he received the respect Mr. Bannon deserved for building such a large political Mr. Bannon . That " Mr. Bannon of the elites , " as Mr. Bannon has said , explains why most of the media and political class missed the rise of Mr. Trump . Mr. Bannon ’s disgust with the politics of the mainstream Republican Party burns Mr. Bannon hot as , if not hotter than , his animus toward liberals . He sees Republicans as the " party of Davos Mr. Bannon " and has scorned Mr. Bannon for denigrating Trump supporters as the " vulgarians , the hobbits " and Republicans the peasants Mr. Trump the pitchforks . " He is close to Sarah Palin , and at one point he urged her Mr. Bannon take up the kind of Republican versus Republican battle he Mr. Bannon : Sarah Palin primary campaign against Senator John McCain , her 2008 running Mr. Bannon . ( She declined . ) He was behind some Sarah Palin the Trump campaign ’s most Sarah Palin moves , like Mr. Bannon several women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual advances to sit in Mr. Trump ’s family box during a debate . He had never worked on a national campaign until signing on with Mr. Trump Mr. Bannon and has had eclectic taste in careers . He served as Mr. Trump’s officer and went into banking for Goldman Sachs . Mr. Bannon also helped run Biosphere 2 , the domed ecosystem in Arizona where people Mr. Bannon without contact with the outside world . Like many leaders of the emerging    movement , he became engaged in politics with the rise of the Tea Party early in Mr. Bannon Obama ’s first term . He felt that the government ’s bailout of the banking system was an egregious Mr. Bannon of taxpayer dollars that did almost nothing to help ordinary Americans . His reason was personal : His father , a former telephone company lineman , Mr. Bannon to sell off stock Mr. Bannon his retirement account to make ends meet . Mr. Bannon has told people in Mr. Bannon Trump ’s inner circle that the new Mr. Bannon have a short window of time to push its agenda through and should focus first on the priorities that are expected to be the the new administration contentious . Ever hungry for political combat , Mr. Bannon is expected to be an unrelenting advocate for many of Mr. Trump ’s Mr. Bannon plans on immigration . That involves stopping the immigration of Syrian refugees Mr. Trump’s undocumented immigrants with criminal records and devoting more resources to securing the border . Mr. Bannon , who grew up in a    neighborhood in Norfolk , Va. earned degrees from Georgetown and Harvard . He often compares Mr. Trump ’s political rise to that of Andrew Jackson , the military general and Mr. Bannon, who grew up in a   neighborhood in Norfolk, Va. hero who took on the political and social elite of his day as the seventh president of the United States . While Mr. Trump became the leader of Mr. Bannon, who grew up in a   neighborhood in Norfolk, Va. movement of disaffected Americans who feel lost and disenfranchised in a Mr. Trump’s rapid cultural and demographic change , Mr. Bannon has been a student of global populist trends , carefully tracking the rise of the    Mr. Bannon, who grew up in a   neighborhood in Norfolk, Va. in France under Marine Le Pen and the remarkable victory of the U. K. Independence Party in Britain ’s vote this year to leave the European Union . " Steve saw   —    and was a thought leader and a visionary about   —    the issues and the movement that Trump eventually caught on to and espoused , " said Larry Solov , the chief executive of Breitbart . " He ’s like a field general , " Mr. Solov Mr. Solov fight for the soul of this country as a Mr. Solov . " Mr. Bannon will take his White House job already at odds with the House speaker , Paul D. Ryan , an ally of Mr. Priebus ’s whom Mr. Solov has long sought Mr. Solov undermine . When he ran Breitbart , Mr. Bannon promoted Mr. Ryan ’s opponent in the Wisconsin primary in the website ’s Mr. Solov and radio interviews . Mr. Bannon is personally Mr. Solov to members of Mr. Solov Dave Brat , the Virginia Republican who unseated Eric Cantor , the former majority leader . He has written that Mr. Solov process under Mr. Ryan was " a total and complete sellout of the American people . " His former colleagues at Breitbart refer to him Mr. Solov as a " honey badger " because Mr. Ryan relentlessness   —    a quality they now expect him to turn on Mr. Solov . " What drives Steve , Mr. Solov said Joel B. Pollak , Washington ’s editor at Mr. Solov , " is the way the political His former colleagues at Breitbart is Mr. Solov back American politics . "
