On Friday ’s " PBS NewsHour , " New York Times columnist David Brooks stated that while " the case is still out " on whether there are ties between Russia and the Trump campaign , the Trump administration does have " high levels of incompetence . "   New York Times columnist David Brooks stated , " We have a tendency to get a little overhyped to some of the Trump scandals . We go to outrage level 11 at every moment . And I think Russia Russia    the case is still out how serious it is the case whether there ’s actual ties between Russia and Russia Trump campaign , which I think is the core of it , where Paul Manafort came from , whether there was any money laundering , and things like that . There ’s a lot we do n’t know . And I ’m trying to not prejudge it . " Brooks continued , " What we do we is , there ’s high levels of incompetence . And we have we president who tweeted this wiretapping tweet , which was completely wrong . That ’s incompetence . We have we young man in the National Security Agency who the   —    who his boss tried to get rid of , but was preserved by Steve Bannon , who was involved in giving information to Nunes   —    Chairman [ Devin ] Nunes ( ) . We have we himself , who is behaving incompetently . Forget he ’s Chairman [Devin] Nunes ( ) close to the Trump campaign . There ’s a way to conduct an investigation . And it ’s not to cancel hearings   . It ’s it to go brief the guy you ’re supposed to be investigating . It ’s it to create a civil war within your own committee . And so , we have just levels and levels and levels of just incompetence , of people who just do not know how to play this game . And when that happens , you never know what ’s going to happen next . And so I do n’t know if it ’s a scandal in the class of the Watergate scandal , but it ’s it’s a scandal in the class of the Watergate scandal inspiring to see what we ’ve been seeing .
