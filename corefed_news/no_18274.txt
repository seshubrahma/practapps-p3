’   ’ ’    President Donald Trump told Fox News on Friday that Michael Flynn    was " already approved by the Obama administration at the highest    level " when Michael Flynn    was hired to serve as national security    adviser in January . ’ "    Flynn , who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012 to    2014 , came under renewed scrutiny earlier this week when the    House Oversight Committee   from Russia ’s    news agency , Russia Today ,    when    was renewing    security clearance in January 2016 . " "    Flynn also lobbied on behalf of a Turkish businessman with ties    to Russia ’s government between August and November of 2016 ,    but he    not register as a foreign agent with the Justice    Department until earlier this year .   " ’    The White House has said that what Flynn Flynn as a private    citizen , after he Flynn from the DIA and before he Flynn hired by    the Trump administration , was not its The White House . But Trump the Trump administration    faced questions about why Flynn , who was forced to step down as       security adviser after only 24 days , was not more       vetted for potential conflicts of interest before he the Trump administration    brought into the White House .   ’ ’   ’ ’’ ’    Trump replied that while he Trump feel badly , Flynn " was approved    by the Obama administration at the highest level . " ’ ’    " And when they say we they n’t vet , well Obama Obama guess did n’t vet ,       he    approved at the highest level of security by the    Obama Obama , " Trump said .

" "    Still , many national security and intelligence experts argue    that , in light of Flynn ’s lobbying work throughout Flynn’s the    fact that he was pushed out by   Flynn’s Obama    administration in 2014 , he should have been subject   Flynn’s more    scrutiny before he was elevated to such   Flynn’s        position at the White House .
