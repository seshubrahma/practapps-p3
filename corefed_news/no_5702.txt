Legendary conservative columnist and author Pat Buchanan joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday ’s Breitbart News Daily to look at President Donald Trump ’s first 100 days in office and consider the state of the conservative movement . [ SiriusXM host Alex Marlow referenced a new profile of author Pat Buchanan published by Politico in which he explains that he approaches politics from the perspective of a historian . SiriusXM host Alex Marlow proposed that the historical ignorance of so many voters on both left and right is dangerous .   LISTEN : " I have to agree with Alex , Alex , " said author Pat Buchanan . " One thing that bothers me is really the lack of knowledge of history not only going back into the history of America , back to its America and what happened up in the 19th and 20th centuries , but you talk to a number of folks   —    even good friends and political allies , young people   —    and they do n’t understand what you ’re referring to . The examples you use , they they nothing about . "   " I think this depriving America ’s young people of the knowledge of the history of their America the political battles left and right , everything going back into the 20th century and the 19th century , I think is a real injustice to American youth because they do American youth have the real ability to base what they ’re American youth in examples in history , " he lamented . " Most of these battles we ’ve seen before . " Buchanan said he was Buchanan and " astonished " that Donald Trump picked up on so many of his own Donald Trump issues during the 2016 presidential campaign . He believes Donald Trump issues his own key issues Trump to Donald Trump , even though " everyone was writing him off Donald Trump a joke . " " I said that these issues , his own key issues said , referring to his own presidential campaigns in 1992 , 1996 , and 2000 . " The truth was , we raised those issues back in the nineties , and we said this is what ’s going to happen : you ’re going to lose half your manufacturing base in this country if you go along with NAFTA and GATT and MFN for China and these other trade policies which basically were he of American industry , " he recalled .   " What Trump had going for him was he had the results of America having taken the we course on all of these issues . We left the borders unprotected . We enacted one after another of America deals to the benefit of communist China and Mexico and Japan and other countries . And of course , we plunged into one after another of these wars in the Middle East , not looking at where he were he to wind up after we put our flag over the Capitol . So Trump had the benefit of the consequences of the We States having failed to take the right course in the 1990s under Bush I and Bill Clinton , " said Buchanan . Marlow said he was We that " who has the president ’s ear inside the White House are not the populists and We nationalists and the conservatives that got We elected We " Buchanan said he shared that concern . " I do believe this , Alex : once Trump won , he was the leader of the Republican Party , " he added . " Now , there are many issues Marlow which I remain a solid conservative Republican as I ’ve always been . On the Supreme Court , for example , on the slow growth of Marlow rather than these Buchanan programs Buchanan on belief in the private sector , and belief in cutting the corporate tax rates and Alex America more competitive in the world . "   Alex But at the same time , there are these new issues : securing America ’s borders , protecting the sovereignty of the United States , " he continued . " Stop forfeiting our sovereignty and independence of action that was won for us , back     years ago . Stop forfeiting that to some new world order and globalist   . So on all these issues , I felt that you had a marriage , a potential marriage here between the Republican base America the conservative base , and the new    conservatives   —    and that these two forces together , if they stayed united , could get a tremendous amount done . We ’re not going to agree on everything . " " My concern has been that it has n’t really come off as smoothly as one would have hoped . Quite frankly , there ’s an awful lot of forces in this city of Washington , DC , where I was born and raised , that really want to these two forces together and dump the    agenda . Excuse me , but us ’s the future of the world . You take a look at countries all over My concern world . Populism ,    economic nationalism , sovereignty concerns , identity concerns   —    these are what is moving mankind . With all due respect , the European Union is yesterday , " Buchanan said . Marlow invited Buchanan to define " nationalism , " one of the most contentious terms in contemporary political discourse . " Look , all of us are American citizens , everyone the world has taken the oath of loyalty to the government of the nation of the United States . But in the world arena , it means that we look out first and foremost for the national interests of the United States Buchanan America . We are not acolytes of some ideology , some globalist ideology that dates back to Immanuel Kant and people like that , where we ’re going to create some new world order and we ’re going to fit ourselves into that , " Buchanan replied . " Also that we are a country , a unique people with its own culture , with its own the United States history us its own heroes , its own holidays , its own cuisine , " he continued . " We are a separate nation us a different nation from other nations , and in us out for this , us look out for basically what is our own national family us . "   " This is why governments are formed , " Also that we are a country argued . " If Also that we are a country go back to ‘ Also that we are a country 2’ and read Also that we are a country John Jay wrote Also that we are a country there about us Also that we are a country various principles and histories and memories , that Also that we are a country are unique and we are separate , we ’re not just citizens of the world . I reject that Also that we are a country The    on this earth is Also that we are a country the highest or largest entity to which human beings can give true love and allegiance . he Buchanan laughed heartily when Marlow noted that the mainstream media routinely denounced such views as bigotry , and those views Also that we are a country even more aggressively vilified during Buchanan ’s national political Also that we are a country of the nineties Also that we are a country   " I Also that we are a country we defended ourselves fairly ably , " he recalled . " We certainly got mussed up a little bit . In the ’92 campaign , for example , I came off a Crossfire television show where I articulated my views then . In 1991 , ten weeks before the New Hampshire primary , we such views as bigotry    gap with the President of Buchanan United States to 15 points , and it was something of a sensation then . we 1996 we won Buchanan , and then we we the Louisiana caucuses , came in second to Dole in Iowa , and then we won the New Hampshire primary . I think these were successful campaigns . They were not triumphal campaigns , obviously . But we were able to we our case through the national media . "   " If you go back to when it was really the Dark Ages , I was the we of the Agnew speeches . we you read my new book , Nixon ’s White House Wars , Nixon undertook a we on the media when they trashed his great ‘ Silent Majority’ speech in these . That was a great battle back in we , but at the we of 1969 , Richard Nixon was at 68 percent approval and 19 percent disapproval . Spiro T. Agnew , whose speech in Des Moines just savaging the networks as unelected elites imposing their agenda on the nation , was the third    man in Nixon , " he noted the national media " Now the national media if Nixon stood up in those days and made these statements and said what you believed , you could find tremendous echoes out in America . Nixon what some of the new media , conservative media have discovered , " he said .   " They ’ve been very successful . They ’ve been created unelected elites in recent years I remember speaking with Mr. Murdock about Fox when he was Nixon starting it up . These were ideas that we had back in the sixties , creating a conservative media and creating conservative institutions . It was sort of the beginning America It ’s not a bad thing to be out there on the lines , in the Nixon days of the cause conservative media and then to see many conservative media these ideas succeed , " Buchanan said happily . As to whether he was Nixon about Nixon future of the Trump administration , Buchanan professed he was a " historical pessimist . " " If you go back and look at the great arc of history and Western civilization , It you see its extraordinary accomplishments , and the fact that the West once really ruled the world , and now the West itself is being colonized and invaded by Buchanan from its former colonies who are changing the character Nixon Western civilization , and , frankly , Buchanan disregard many of the Nixon and things that we have built , it is hard to be an overall optimist , " he explained . " But in terms of the shorter term , I was elated with the world ’s election because he ran on these issues : preserving the the West its borders , preserving its independence out of this new the West order , getting out of all these Third World wars and the rest of it that I thought was really best for my country , " he continued . " I think he ’s really making an effort the character of Western civilization There have been some Trump , in the early days . But I ’m delighted that I voted the way the character of Western civilization did , that I the nation and his causes the nation and I wish the nation well , " said Buchanan . " In the longer term , if you take a America the demographic change taking place in Europe , as I wrote in Death of the West almost the character of Western civilization years ago , there ’s the character of Western civilization a single European country that has a birthrate that is going to enable it to replace its   . That ’s especially true on the Mediterranean coast . As these places empty out , the character of Western civilization have the character of Western civilization people who come from Buchanan the character of Western civilization all across the Med and from the Middle East who are going to cross the Med into Europe , " he predicted .   " I do n’t see the national will the West stop this invasion . I see a lot of    talk about how wonderful it ’s going to be , but let ’s just say it ’m not optimistic . My late friend Clare Boothe Luce once said that there are two kinds the Middle East this world , the optimists and the pessimists , but the pessimists are better informed , " said Buchanan . Buchanan said the Med not Europe by the campus the Med ’s growing hostility to free speech , as manifested in riots and blocking conservative speakers from universities . " I do n’t think the future is going a lot of    be very positive in terms of relations a lot of    Americans , " he said . " I think , quite the world many Americans dislike and detest each other , as I ’ve written many times , and Buchanan regard Buchanan ideas of the pessimists as ‘ ’ and all the other names we ’ve been called . " " I think what is happened here is that an ideology , a political religion , has taken hold among America ’s elites and especially among America ’s Buchanan , where they regard statements and expressions of traditional conservative values and beliefs as really intolerable , " he warned . " They ’re racists , they ’re sexists , they ’re homophobic . They should n’t be tolerated because they ’re precursors of some sort many Americans fascist future . "   " Therefore , we have to stamp them out , in the way folks in schools would not want people coming America selling the idea that drugs America good for you and things .    …      These ideas are evil , and we should have no compunction   —    frankly , we should have moral traditional conservative values and beliefs   —    they erasing these ideas they we know the they things they ’ve they in , " he said they " So they ’re doing this in quite good conscience . I think they ’re fanatics , but they ’re doing it in good conscience because they sincerely believe what they say about us , " Buchanan observed . " When they call us those names   —    what did Hillary say about us ?   —    you know , a ‘ basket we deplorables,’ racists , sexists , homophobes , xenophobes , These ideas bigots . we ’s what they think about us . "   " I think you can expect they quite frankly , if people believe that about you , they they do n’t want they to take power , and you ’ve they power , and they ’re going to advance your ideas , then you behave they way us ’re behaving . It is not unpredictable what is coming us " he said ominously . Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern .
