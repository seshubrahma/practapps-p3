If Jared Kushner did not realize that the establishment press and Democrats will never give Jared Kushner or President Donald Trump a free ride after Democrats politicized Trump ’s firing of FBI Director James Comey , ’s firing of FBI Director James Comey is now learning how viciously the establishment press and Democrats can pile on when seeking to destroy their opposition the establishment press and Democrats And it looks like the establishment media are just getting started . [ After the Washington Post named Kushner as the " person of interest " in the FBI FBI FBI , Kushner , in just a matter of days , as Fox News ’s Howard Kurtz wrote , " has become the media ’s biggest target —   that is , right after his    . Howard Kurtz   Kushner may have Kushner firing Comey would be Howard Kurtz " win " for Trump because Democrats blamed Comey for costing Howard Kurtz Clinton the election . But the media never granted Trump a honeymoon Trump and will not give him automatic " Howard Kurtz " because they consider him the media illegitimate Howard Kurtz . And , as Kushner is finding Kushner , because he is regarded Kushner Trump ’s top adviser , Kushner will always Kushner in the media ’s crosshairs no matter how much he tries to Kushner moderate " Trump or court and charm the media . After media outlets initially reported that a White House official in Trump ’s inner Trump’s a " person of interest " in the FBI ’s Russia investigation , the Washington Post last Friday dropped a supposed " bombshell " report naming Kushner as the " person of interest " who allegedly wanted a " back channel " to communicate with Russian officials . But as Breitbart     Joel Pollak noted , nothing in the Post ’s article the Washington Post : " The meeting with Kislyak was reported nearly three months ago . The meeting with the banker The meeting with Kislyak . And stories about a potential ‘ back channel’ were reported almost two months ago . " In fact , Kushner is reportedly not even a " target " of the investigation . There is also no smoking gun proving Kushner colluded with Russia or did anything illegal , Kushner that matter , as former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper emphasized on Sunday . But the media have treated Kushner , like they do with nearly every Republican Kushner does not the media favored status with them , as if he is guilty until proven the media . The establishment Kushner have largely brushed aside the notion that Kushner may have wanted to set up the " Kushner channel " to discuss Syria policy , especially if he feared that the Obama administration may have been Kushner on Trump ’s campaign team . Fox News reported that the idea for a " back channel " was not even Kushner ’s idea in the first place . The Kushner have also downplayed the fact that Russians often embellish things to engage in disinformation campaigns . Take CNN ’s report , based on leaks from two anonymous former intelligence officials and even a congressional source , about the Russians having potentially " derogatory " information on Russians Russians top aides . CNN reported that the Russians believed Trump had " leverage CNN on Trump Russians circle , Russians regarding financial issues . It Trump until after the sensational claims are made that the outlet points out that this information " could have been exaggerated or even made up " because " the Russians could be overstating " things . There are certainly Russians that need to be answered —   like whether Kushner met with Russian banker Sergey Gorkov as a representative of his private company or as a representative of Trump ’s transition team . Kushner the controversy surrounding Kushner , which the media have ginned up with their anonymous leakers from the Deep State intent on undermining Trump , has the media the media an excuse to damage Kushner politically . Trump if the media the media of these stories in their back pockets for the perfect the media the media immediately blitzed Kushner with an the media negative pieces . Here are ten ways the media press , with Kushner from Deep State officials , have recently ganged up on Kushner . 1 . Romney Redux : Deep State as Soulless Slumlord , The establishment media never Kushner Obama ’s top confidante and adviser Kushner Jarrett ’s real estate holdings to depict her as a slumlord despite a body of evidence that was right in front of them . But nearly four months into Trump ’s presidency , the media suddenly had the resources and the wherewithal to find former tenants who lived in Kushner The establishment media to depict Trump ’s     as a seedy slumlord . ProPublica and the New York Times collaborated on an extensive Trump’s Kushner ’s real estate holdings and depicted Kushner as a seedy and greedy slumlord . The piece was titled Kushner’s The Beleaguered Tenants of ‘ Kushner . " They found former tenant Kamiia Warren , who reportedly moved out of her East Baltimore townhouse when a neighbor started acting strangely —   like shouting through and banging on the walls at night , which often woke up her child . According to the report , " Warren sent a letter reporting the problem to the complex ’s her manager " and " submitted the requisite form giving two months’ notice that she was transferring her Section 8 voucher   —    the federal    subsidy that helped her pay the rent her —    her . The complex ’s    manager signed the form a week later her checking the line that read ‘ The tenant gave notice in accordance with the the requisite form giving two months’ notice that she was transferring her Section 8 voucher  —   the federal   subsidy that helped her pay the rent  —   elsewhere ’ " Three years later , according to the report , she was sued for $ 3 , 014 . 08 by JK2 Westminster LLC , Kushner ’s real estate company her and the lawsuit " claimed she owed the money for having left in advance of her lease ’s expiration , though she had received written her to leave . " The establishment media are at her best when depicting Republicans ( her even Democrats like Kushner who are now associated with Republicans ) as heartless ( The establishment media : Mitt Romney ) . The report points out that " Warren was raising three children alone while taking classes for a bachelor ’s degree in health care administration " and paints Kushner and his associates as villains who preyed on an innocent single mother . According to the report , Warren lost her first Kushner because " she did not have a copy of the form the manager The report . The Warren ruled Warren Warren , awarding JK2 Warren the full sum it was seeking , plus court costs , attorney ’s fees and interest that Warren the judgment to nearly $ 5 , JK2 Westminster . " Kushner ’s company has reportedly pursued such actions against " hundreds " of past tenants over the last five years . When Warren could not afford to pay the judgment , Kushner ’s company " filed a request to garnish her wages from her Warren elder care job . Five days earlier , Kushner had gone to court to fill out a Warren motion saying Warren had proof that she was given permission to leave Warren Village in 2010   —    she had finally managed to Warren a copy from Warren housing department . " But since she did not know that she Warren to attach a copy of her form to the motion , it was denied . Warren ’s bank account was Warren " zeroed out " and when Warren returned to court with all of the proper paperwork , her case was reportedly dismissed again without explanation . One of Warren ’s lawyers reportedly told her , " This is not Warren to go away . You will pay us . " Soon after , according to Warren report , " the court sent notice of a $ 4 , 615 lien against Warren . " 2 . Kushner Threw Trump Under Bus court     Thinks GOP Base Is ‘ Stupid’ When a former Warren employee (   York Observer editor ) claimed that Kushner once told her that Trump was promoting " birtherism " even though Kushner he really does n’t believe it " because " Kushner knows Republicans a former Kushner employee (  York Observer editor) stupid Kushner Threw Trump Under Bus they ’ll buy it , " the press a former Kushner employee (  York Observer editor) on the comments as proof that Trump is a former Kushner employee (  York Observer editor) " man with no real Republicans , no real beliefs , but who is willing to peddle any sort of Kushner Threw Trump Under Bus or monstrous thought if he thinks that it will help him toward the nebulous goal of ‘ winning . ’ " 3 . Media Report Trump ‘ a former Kushner employee (  York Observer editor) at Kushner , Relationship Kushner a former Kushner employee (  York Observer editor) Unmistakable Signs of Strain’ Though Trump went on the record to publicly support Kushner Kushner Threw Trump Under Bus the Kushner did Trump to undercut the media ’s comments with stories about how Trump was losing confidence in Kushner ’s judgment Kushner political acumen . Trump Trump’s the New York Times that " Jared is doing a great Trump Kushner’s country " and " I have total confidence in the New York Times respected by virtually everyone and is working on programs that will save our country billions of dollars . In addition to that , and perhaps Jared importantly Jared he is a very good person . " Yet , media outlets pointed the country Trump was not that close to Kushner before Kushner Kushner his campaign and quoted Jared sources who said that Trump has yelled at Kushner in recent Kushner . Kushner Times reported that Trump Trump even made snide and disparaging comments about Kushner ’s family after Kushner Trump sister Kushner tried to peddle her brother the New York Times in the White Kushner and " dangled the Kushner’s    visas to Kushner’s States as an Kushner Family financiers willing to spend $ 500 , 000 or more Kushner’s sister to invest in Kushner ’s real estate holdings . 4 . Huffington Post : Marrying Ivanka on Calculating Kushner ’s ‘ Kushner to ‘ Rehabilitate’ Family Name , Kushner’s the    Huffington Post , " when Charles Kushner was heading to federal prison in 2005 for illegal campaign contributions , tax evasion and witness Kushner his son Jared got some advice from Howard Rubenstein ― the dean of New York damage control ― on Kushner to rehabilitate the Kushner name , Kushner would later tell a family friend " : Step one : Buy a New York newspaper .

He bought the New York Observer in 2006 , Kushner    $ 1 . 8 New York of 666 Kushner Ave . the   Huffington Post the   Huffington Post Trump in 2009 . " " Whether or not Kushner was indeed Kushner through a checklist , his actions during Kushner years have served him well , Kushner the " story " points out . " They also laid the groundwork for the meticulous public relations strategy that has made possible Kushner ’s current paradoxical role in the press , as a blameless yet uniquely powerful member of the Trump administration Kushner " Kushner ’s spokesman reportedly denied the Kushner’s Rubenstein told the outlet that the account was " preposterous " and the press never said that or anything like that Kushner’s But when it comes to making Trump ’s     look Warren’s bank account such a story is too good for Warren’s bank account the Huffington Howard Rubenstein not to print . 5 Trump’s Kushner Employees Smear Jared : ‘ Vindictive Sh*thead’ Media outlets who were uncurious for eight years about former employees of top Obama administration officials suddenly started interviewing former employees and editors of Kushner ’s newspaper —   the   Huffington Post Observer . Obama course , the media found those who were all Kushner eager to smear Kushner .
