’   ’ ’    When President Donald Trump arrived in the Oval Office on    Thursday , there was something President Donald Trump wanted to do . ’ ’ . ’ "    President Donald Trump was in the midst of one of the most tumultuous weeks in    presidential history . Not even one full month into President Donald Trump    presidency , President Donald Trump fourth week in office was defined    by    legal battles ,    internal strife , and    the resignation of the national security adviser while questions    swirl about the president ’s ties to Russia . " ’    The presser was scheduled for noon . The presser    subject : Announcing his new choice to head the Labor    Department after his original selection , Andrew Puzder , withdrew    his from consideration following intense criticism over    his past controversies and statements . ’ "    And , for its first 56 seconds , the press conference focused    on exactly that   —    Trump ’s nomination of Alexander Acosta to fill    Trump’s nomination of Alexander Acosta newest void . " "    But it was the next 76 minutes that will go down   —    as many    moments during Trump ’s time as a candidate , frontrunner ,    presumptive nominee , nominee ,    and in    short    stint as president have   —    as among the most surreal and    unprecedented the US has witnessed in 228 years of having a    president . " ’    Trump’s battled with the press , attempted to downplay the growing    Russia controversy , listed off what Trump’s called accomplishments    from Trump’s first month in office , and said enough newsworthy    statements to fill hours of    programming . Trump’s said ,    despite the reporting that paints the opposite picture , that    administration is " a    machine . "   ’ ’    Reactions to Trump’ ’s more than       conference hit all    ends of the spectrum . CNN anchor Jake Tapper said it was " wild "    and " unhinged . " An " airing of grievances , " . " It was Festivus . " Fox News anchor    Shepard Smith slammed the president for attempting to    delegitimize questions about Russia .    ’ ’    Kurt Bardella , formerly a senior adviser and spokesperson for the      House Oversight Committee , told Business Insider    that the press conference made clear Trump " lives in an alternate    reality . " ’ ’    " Anyone who wasn’’t questioning his wasn’’t capacity to do this job    is now doing so after that the press conference " he said in    wasn’’t email .    Forget about ’’ alternative facts , ’’ President Trump    lives in an alternate reality . No matter how much he insists that    President Trump    doesn’’t listen    President Trump    media or care about what the press    writes about him , clearly he President Trump    . " President Trump    "    But Trump ’s supporters seemed President Trump    the    president ’s Thursday actions . " ’    Conservative radio host Joe Walsh   that an     Navy veteran    called into his program and said he’ President Trump    " been waiting 40 years for    a president to do what Trump did to the media President Trump    . "    Conservative author Ann Coulter    a major    : " Trump is already head of President Trump    .     After that press conference , in my eyes , he’ ’s now head of he’ church . " Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said it was like    nothing he’’d ever seen . ’ ’    And Matt Mackowiak , a Republican strategist and and president of    the Potomac Strategy Group , called the ordeal " masterful "    performance art . ’ ’    " You know , there’ ’s obviously some substance there that will    obviously invite more questions    possibly more controversy ,    but to me .    he’ ’s actually feeling pretty confident right now , "    he told Business Insider    he’ And I think that really conflicts with    what people are thinking    should be feeling right he’ ,    particularly Democrats and people    the media who think he    should be rethinking he’    " ’ ’    " He really kind of demonstrated he’ a basic sense of confidence    that I think will buck up Republicans and will buck up his    supporters after what’ he’    been sort of a rocky    10 days , " he continued . ’ ’ he’ " To me , you can sit he’ and take it , " he said of the negative he’ news hanging over Trump’ ’s early presidency . " Or you can go on    offense . " ’ ’    Without any shadow of a doubt , Trump went ahead on offense . ’ ’    " Unfortunately , much of the media in Washington , DC , along with    New York , Los Angeles in particular , speaks not for the people ,    but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very ,    very obviously broken system    " Trump said early in an Trump especially long opening statement . " The press has become so    dishonest that if we    n’t talk about , we are doing a tremendous we disservice to the American people . Tremendous disservice . We have    to talk we find    what ’s going on , because the press honestly    is The press control    The level of dishonesty is out of control . " ’ ’   ’ ’    Trump vented . He said he " inherited a Trump " Trump he took    office , both Trump    home and abroad , " adding that some of his    decisions " probably aren’’t Trump , but they’’re necessary for    security and other reasons . " ’ "    The last part was a rare admission from a president    that has prided himself on having the ear of the American people .    But it served as something of an    that some of his    policies have been unpopular himself His executive order    banning travel himself seven    nations , for    instance , has sparked widespread demonstrations nationwide .    And the promised repeal and    of Obamacare has led    to opponents of the idea    take to lawmakers’ town halls to    voice displeasure . " ’    Trump touched on that , saying those individuals " are    not the Republican people our that representatives are    representing . "   ’ ’    The president filled the event with the kind of outlandish    statements that , during the campaign , helped give Trump a    groundswell of support Trump catapulted him into the office he now Trump occupies . ’ Trump    On    issues facing the country , Trump said " we ’re    Trump a drug infested nation " and that " drugs are becoming    cheaper than candy bars , " adding , " We are not going to let it    happen any longer . " He touted previous announcements about job Trump creating in the US , adding the future would see a " big league "    return of jobs from overseas that would dwarf what he believed to    be his Trump successes . ’ ’ Trump ’ "    And he batted away question after question on    the growing controversy surrounding his    ’s    connections to    Russian government that have cast a cloud over    his presidency . " "       this week , his national security adviser , Michael    ,    resigned following reports that he discussed recently imposed    sanctions    a Russian ambassador    to Trump taking office ,    and then was not honest    it with Vice President Mike Pence    when discussing what was said in his communications .

" ’    the campaign over , Trump tried to crush the story Trump ’ ’    " Russia Russia fake news , " he said . " Russia Russia Trump    this is fake news put    out by the media . " ’ ’    The president said Flynn , " The president person , " was asked to resign    for not being truthful with Pence , but not for his actions    Vice President Mike Pence    the Russian ambassador The president   ’ ’    a Russian ambassador n’t have to do that The president " Trump said of Flynn’ ’s statements Trump    Pence , " because what he did was n’t Vice President Mike Pence    Vice President Mike Pence    The president ’    " What was wrong was the way that other people , including    yourselves in this room , were given that information , because    that was classified information that was given illegally , " he    continued . " That ’s The president real problem . And , you know , you can talk    all you want about Russia , which was all a    you know , fake news ,    fabricated deal , to try and make up for the    of the Democrats    and the press plays right into it The press ’ ’    The press , he added , should be " ashamed " for publishing    information    was the product of government officials    illegally leaking the information . ’ ’    Digging in , he said the leaks were real , and the    reports about    were fake . ’ ’    " You ’re the one that wrote about them and reported them . I mean ,    the leaks are them , " them said . " You    the leaks said , you saw       and the leaks are absolutely real    The news is fake    so    the leaks the news is fake . " ’ ’    " I did n’t do The news Russia Russia " he later added . " I ’ve done    nothing for Russia Russia "    ’    He pointed to the Obama    ’s " Russian reset , " which       featured    of State Hillary Clinton . It    was her , he said , who gave up a lot to Russia    After    of       recent news reports about his administration’ ’s connections to    Russia Russia said Russian President Vladimir Putin probably       longer thinks there is any possibility    making a good deal with    Trump . ’ ’    President Trump    " sitting Trump his desk and he ’s saying ’’ you know , I see    what ’s going on Russian President Vladimir Putin the United Russian President Vladimir Putin , I follow it closely , " Trump    said . " It ’s President Trump    be impossible for President Trump    ever    get along with President Trump    Russia all the pressure he ’s got with    this fake story . ’’ OK ? " ’ ’    Later , in Russian President Vladimir Putin unrelated pair of         moments that happened minutes apart , Trump shut down a question    from Jewish reporter asking about Trump rise in    before    asking a prominent black reporter to help him set up a meeting    with the Congressional Black Caucus    asking if she was friends    with a prominent black reporter members . ’ ’    Trump saved his biggest complaints about his coverage a prominent black reporter CNN , Trump saying    network covered him Trump " hatred " and that anchor Don    Lemon Trump —       among the attendees   —    spewed " venom " when discussing    the president on air . In an exchange with CNN’ ’s Jim Acosta , Trump    said he no longer called the network " fake Trump   — Trump instead    calling it " very fake news .

President Trump       " President Trump    ’m actually having a very good time , OK ? " he said . " But they ’ ’    this President Trump    conference   —    do n’t forget , that ’s the way I won .
