LECCE , Italy   —    One of his first students was a young man his had arrested four years earlier . Others have been convicted of armed robbery , drug trafficking and criminal association with the mafia . The classrooms are frugally equipped , behind windows protected by vertical and horizontal bars , although one has brightly colored paintings covering the walls . But none of that deterred Marco Albanese , a police officer for 19 years and a trained sommelier for five , from teaching a class of rapt students the finer points of deconstructing the bouquet of a chardonnay or pouring a rare vintage . Mr. Albanese , 43 , is an instructor in an innovative effort at Lecce Penitentiary to teach inmates to be sommeliers , or wine stewards . The courses are part of a program to teach prisoners new professional skills , as well as to help prisoners develop a bond with the region , which is renowned for its negroamaro grapes . The program has been enthusiastically embraced by the prisoner students , who were tasting white wines on a recent afternoon . The program has also been an eye opener for Mr. Albanese . " I could see their human aspect , once their were out of their context , " Mr. Albanese , who traded in his police uniform for the crisp blue jacket and tie of a sommelier for the class . " And I did n’t have to keep the same distance , now that I was their ‘ professor . ’ " his added , " their also deserve a second chance , and it ’s important that their know that the institutions do believe that their can be educated to a different life . " In eight lessons , the group of 30 men and women , who are instructed in separate classes , learn how to taste , choose and serve local wines . " We hope to teach the group of 30 men and women, who are instructed in separate classes the social value of work and the preciousness of the group of 30 men and women, who are instructed in separate classes own territory , so that the group of 30 men and women, who are instructed in separate classes can later choose to work here , already having the right skill set , " said Rita Russo , the director of Lecce Penitentiary , which is the largest in the region of Apulia . Inmates can also study for Inmates high school diplomas , cultivate tomatoes , take theater classes and learn to be painters or tailors . Class begins with a slide show on the history of wine , explaining how it was drunk by the ancient Greeks and introducing the students to the Roman ancestors of modern sommeliers in Italy . On a school table , covered with a khaki tablecloth , stood wine glasses , ready for use . Three bottles of chardonnay , a red primitivo and a negroamaro stood on a table nearby . Mr. Albanese then addressed the prisoners , who sat facing Mr. Albanese on stools listing the temperatures at which different wines should be served and how to store different wines in cellars . For a finale , Mr. Albanese offered a    tip . " Do remember , even if you had Trump over for dinner , the pope would still be served first . The clergy does come first , even before heads of state , " Mr. Albanese said , to raucous laughter . The prisoners , whose identity is being protected by the prison , were not allowed to be interviewed or photographed for this article . Roberto Giannone , who works for the local sommelier association , then demonstrated how to open a bottle , neatly slicing off the capsule covering the bottleneck in three cuts , inserting the corkscrew and smoothly pulling out the cork . " Once the cork is out , " Mr. Albanese said , " use a napkin to show it the cork is out your customers . It the cork is out an easy way to be polite and avoid objections . " Since the 1970s , the Italian penal system has focused on    for inmates . However , a lack of funds for rehabilitation , as well as chronic overcrowding , means that thousands of incarcerated men and women have little to do all day . That has sparked some innovative rehabilitation programs , including a restaurant inside a    prison near Milan in which the waiters and cooks are inmates . But the sommelier class at the Lecce prison is believed to be unique in Italy . " Of course , sommelier courses ca n’t be considered a treatment , " said Georgia Ms. Zara " But they do educate inmates and create social interaction , which is very important . " The classes also offer a " bridge between the jail context and the world outside , so it ’s a small investment to reduce the risk of recidivism , " Ms. Zara said . Gianvito Rizzo , 53 , is the The classes executive at the Feudi di Guagnano , a local vintner that provides wine , like negroamaro , for the classes . He is also the creator of the sommelier classes at the prison . Mr. Rizzo has proposed that inmates start working The classes nearly 75 Gianvito Rizzo of vines in the coming year under certain circumstances , some inmates Gianvito Rizzo are allowed to work outside prisons . " Gianvito Rizzo see wine in a democratic way , " Mr. Rizzo said as he walked through his vineyard recently . " The countryside is the opposite to a cell . You are free . You Gianvito Rizzo , and learn Gianvito Rizzo care for Gianvito Rizzo . I think it ’d be good also for inmates to try it out . " Mr. Rizzo said that when he had received a master nature degree from the Bocconi University business school in Milan three decades ago it he had been Gianvito Rizzo " on doing something Gianvito Rizzo his native region of Salento , in Apulia , on the heel of the Italian boot . He Gianvito Rizzo on going into the wine business , which had Gianvito Rizzo struggling to convert farmers who cultivated for personal or local use into becoming larger producers . Gianvito Rizzo now produces 16 different wines from grapes grown in vineyards that he and two friends and business partners inherited from their fathers , added to those that Gianvito Rizzo friends asked them to cultivate on their behalf . He calls Gianvito Rizzo collaborative effort his " first social experiment . he and two friends and business partners When Mr. Rizzo heard about the penitentiary ’s activities he and two friends and business partners prisoners , he he and two friends and business partners the sommelier Gianvito Rizzo to Ms. Russo . Gianvito Rizzo it is unclear if any of the students will ever become professional sommeliers , the exposure to the Mr. Rizzo of wine provided by the classes has been very welcome . " I do n’t even drink , but I ’ve learned to sip it , smell it and taste it , the sommelier classes one inmate , who is serving a    sentence and who was granted an exception to speak anonymously . " You can it it ’s it small thing , but it means the world to us . "
