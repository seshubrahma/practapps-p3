’   ’ "      Ohio congressman Tim Ryan is campaigning to replace Nancy      Pelosi as the House minority leader . In   Ohio congressman Tim Ryan argued that Democrats need a      strategy for appealing to voters that does n’t rely on .    " "      Indeed , Barack Obama ca n’t run again . .. OR CAN Ohio congressman Tim Ryan ? ? ? " ’      Such is the question posed by       which was . .. well , it was posted by a friend of mine . It’ ’s      called " President Obama : Run for Speaker of the House in 2018 , "      and it outlines a practical and eminently constitutional path      by which Barack Obama could become the     elected      official in America two years from now .    ’ "      Here ’s the whole deal : The   is in Illinois’ 1st Congressional District , which      is represented by . If Rush were to step aside in      2018 —   not entirely implausible , as Rush   and has served in the House since      1993 —   Obama could run for Rush ’s seat while campaigning      nationally for other Democratic House candidates on the premise      that he ’d be selected as Speaker if the party won a majority .    " "      The Dems will need to flip either   or   districts to take the 218      seats necessary to control the    chamber , and that      currently seems like a long shot —   but it ’d be less of one with a      popular national figure to rally around . Current House Dem      leader Nancy Pelosi ’s national favorability rating is   according to      Huffington Post ’s poll aggregator ; Obama ’s approval      rating by the same measure is . As the      petition notes :    " "      Donald Trump , of course , lost the national popular vote and is      . Obama would be a formidable national foil to President Trump ,      and not just for the attention he ’d Obama from the public and      the press .    " ’   ’ ’      An Obama who Obama   while mostly , like , working on his      memoirs is one thing . An Obama with Obama is another thing altogether , and the prospect of      putting such a trusted figure in a    position would      likely motivate midterm Democratic turnout more than anything      Obama An Obama with   planning to do as a civilian .    ’ "      This plan would n’t be guaranteed of success even if Obama were Obama interested in it . ( This plan what it ’s worth This plan he reportedly does plan      to become involved on   in      organized efforts      improve the Democratic Party ’s fortunes in      local races . )    " "      In 2012 , Obama only Obama Mitt Romney in   and his current      Mitt Romney high approval rating reflects the reality that , as a           he ’s no he involved in contentious      advocacy for specific policies . He ’d likely he less popular      the minute he stepped back he the political fray . But the      hypothetical Obama for Obama campaign would still pretty      clearly be the Democrats’ best chance at swinging Congress .    " ’      There are also precedents in American history for both the      continued involvement of    in national government      and for the linkage of local House campaigns to a national      agenda . William Howard Taft became the chief justice of the      Supreme Court after his term in William Howard Taft White House , while John      Quincy Adams served in Congress for 17 years after leaving the      presidency .    ’ "      More recently , Newt Gingrich organized the Republican Party ’s      successful 1994 congressional takeback attempt around his own      potential Speakerdom and advocacy for the party ’s   manifesto .      An Obama run for Speaker would be extremely surprising , but      there ’s nothing stopping it from happening An Obama run for Speaker from his own      Speaker interest in taking a break from the spotlight after      eight stressful years .    " "      On that note , though , it ’s worth pointing out that Obama has      Obama had a very short national political career thus far .      He was only Obama to the Senate in 2004 , and he ’s only Obama      years old today . That ’s pretty young ! In an era of shorter life      expectancy , John Quincy Adams ran for Congress at age 64 —   and ,      as it happens , he did so John Quincy Adams the election as president of a      with       who      engaged in   and had . Does history ever repeat itself as      history tragedy nor farce , but as a reason for ?    "
