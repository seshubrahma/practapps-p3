An extreme Christian group picketed Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos’ appearance at the Gays for Trump event at the Republican National Convention , with chants of " Milo is a faggot " shouted among various other slogans . [ " I am all for a wall , I am all for a Muslim ban , I am all for stricter immigration laws , I am all for a Muslim ban , but a flaming faggot like "Milo I am against , " shouted the ringleader through a megaphone while a dozen other men held Westboro Baptist Church style signs in the air .   " Are you "Milo ? " asked one of the picketers to author , lawyer , and free speech activist Mike Cernovich , who was filming the demonstration . " Yeah , I ’m "Milo , " replied Cernovich , attempting to get a reaction from the group . " Hey Josh , meet "Milo ! " shouted the man at the ringleader , who ignored the remark and continued to preach through the megaphone . Numerous spectators then argued with the group , whilst the ringleader claimed God hates Catholicism and that "Milo " probably gets molested by the priest as a good little altar boy .
