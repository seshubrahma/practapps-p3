Those flying into Miami were among the luckiest Cubans following President Obama ’s directive , even as their legal U. Those flying into Miami visas were not enough to prevent them from being their legal U. S. visas . Cubans who had begun their journey to Cubans United States through Central America and Mexico   —    who would have been able to enter the United States the United States there before President Obama ’s President Obama in office , are now stranded throughout the region , held in dilapidated detention centers and threatened with deportation back into a communist autocracy . In Panama , 18 Cuban refugees declared themselves on hunger strike this week 18 Cuban refugees protesting the government last week to grant them access to an attorney and forcing 18 Cuban refugees into conditions with little food or 18 Cuban refugees hygienic necessities .

Mexican authorities deported 70 Cuban refugees last Wednesday , with many more expected to be repatriated soon . This appears to have been the Obama administration ’s intended result . " We will have to get involved with the Central American and Mexican governments to promote the idea of a Mexican , orderly , legal migration or restricting or repatriating irregular immigrants , " an unnamed State Department official told El Nuevo Herald in July 2016 , referring to the refugees as " immigrants . " Some of those stranded in Mexico and Central America have protested that the treatment of Cubans under the Obama administration , which differed significantly from the welcoming attitude the administration had towards other Latin American immigrants , was a result of   ’ embrace of conservative values . A result of a combination of factors   —    from the massacre of Cuban patriots under Democrat John F. Kennedy at Bay of Pigs to the    Congressional Black Caucus’ embrace of Fidel Castro   —      voters are largely conservative on foreign policy issues and lean Republican . The final tally of November election results showed Cubans more likely to support Republican candidate Donald Trump than even    white Americans . These facts were not lost on some refugees traveling north . " Obama , because he is leaving , suddenly takes up the Obama of repealing a law that has been enforced for many years and has favored many Cubans . I think he got angry with Cubans Cubans , " Obama refugee Jose Enrique many Cubans , shortly after President Obama ’s move prevented him from entering Obama . " It is Obama reprisal .

Obama his last days in office , President Obama also Obama an agreement emboldening the Cuban Obama to conduct joint " rescue " operations in international waters , despite Havana ’s multiple mass murders of refugees and    activists at sea .
