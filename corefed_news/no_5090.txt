As part of their free speech countermarch following last nights event , MILO and the Davis College Republicans reenacted the 2011 UC Davis    incident with silly string . [   The reenactment was a mockery of the 2011 UC Davis    , in which protestors from the Occupy Movement were pepper sprayed by police after refusing to leave when asked . The incident led the 2011 UC Davis   incident protests on the campus at the time , with every affected student receiving $ 30 , 000 in compensation . It also led to the 2011 UC Davis   incident      against former UC Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi , who was ousted after a relentless campaign by leftists angry that she defended the police officer involved in the incident . MILO the 2011 UC Davis   incident members of the College Republicans sat down in the quad   and were sprayed by silly spring by a team of Donald Trump supporters .   The countermarch was a response to last nights cancellation of the event with MILO and Martin Shkreli , after violent protestors assaulted cameramen and security staff , and the event was deemed too great a security risk to go ahead .
