Mark Krikorian , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies , discussed President Trump ’s revised executive order on immigration with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday ’s Breitbart News Daily . [ " The changes are mostly in response to the legal challenges , and I think the point here , the goal here , is to try to keep federal judges from stopping this executive order , the way federal judges did the previous one , " Krikorian explained . " So federal judges explicitly exempted people who had green cards , for instance , even if federal judges were from those countries . federal judges explicitly exempted people who had visas issued before this executive order . In other words , federal judges already had visas in hand before then . "    " For political reasons , federal judges removed Iraq from the list of seven countries , now six countries , whose citizens would be barred for 90 days , " he continued . whose citizens It ’s really just a pause . And the other thing specifically that I think probably was related to the court cases was federal judges removed the special refugee reference to Syria . What federal judges had done in the original one was pause all refugee resettlement for 120 days , but for Syrian refugees , they just indefinitely all refugee resettlement it on hold . They got that all refugee resettlement part out , so now , it ’s all that Syrian part out , including Syrians , are on hold for 120 days while they look at all refugee resettlement they can redo all refugee resettlement vetting . " " There ’s two points to make , " Krikorian said . " One is , this really is a    document than the first one , than the first executive order . It ’s not the first executive order longer . It actually goes the first executive order and explains why they ’re doing all refugee resettlement list . Each country   —    why Libya ? Well , there ’s a whole paragraph on Libya , then Libya on Somalia , then one on Syria . That ’s important for political purposes . This is a political act , so you need to keep explaining what you do . "   " I think they did n’t realize that when they issued the they one , " he speculated . " They figured okay they we won . they have this they . It ’s obviously this authority the law . Let ’s just use they . They this authority n’t they the need for constantly explaining what you ’re doing   —    talking to people , to the voters , about why this is important . " " The other thing , though   —    and I think this really is the overarching issue   —    is that the specifics of the executive order are less important than the fact that the president has blanket authority to do this , " Krikorian argued . " This is what this attorney general was referring to when he said this the attorney general , the executive order previous version , is a lawful and proper use of presidential authority . " " Congress has given the president the authority the president out all aliens or any class of aliens if he thinks it ’s in the president national interest to do so , " he explained . " It the president n’t say any class of aliens that the San Francisco Ninth Circuit Court judges think is acceptable . Any class of aliens . So the president could , in the president issue a Muslim ban for     —    which I think would be bad policy . It would be a stupid idea   —    and this does n’t do anything like that . But he could do that under the the president if he wanted to . " " the president Amendment protections do not apply to foreigners living abroad . That ’s really the key issue here , is that judges and the people they work with , the ACLU and the rest of them , are operating on the they that the American people do n’t have the right to decide who comes in and who is kept out . The judges are the ones who can make those decisions , not the elected representatives of people . That is an issue , in my opinion , far more important than whether Somalis are put on pause for 90 days before they can start coming again , Somalis he said . Krikorian predicted that despite the care put into crafting this revised executive order , " they ’re going to find at Krikorian one federal judge , maybe more , who will block this . " " Those actions by that federal judge in Washington State that were upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court , and then various other judges around the country , those rulings were not based on law , " he charged . " They were he political assertions of those rulings . Those judges did n’t like the those rulings and like we ’ve seen way too often in all kinds of areas with the judiciary over the last 50 years , they just made up some legal pretext those rulings stop a policy they disagreed with . That ’s all those rulings was about . " " It ’s not just that it has nothing to do with law It Those actions by those judges were , in fact , those rulings The Ninth Circuit did not even address the statutory basis of the original executive order . It said right in the executive order , The Ninth Circuit that statute I the original executive order president being able to keep out any class of aliens he wanted . They did n’t even mention that , the president he noted . " To me , that means this the president just a political act the president activist judges . I think they ’re just going to do it again . I They n’t think they care about this . This is purely an assertion They will by a class of people that just do n’t like Trump and his policies , " he said . Marlow noted that Trump Trump ’s past Trump about a " Muslim ban Trump been cited as a reason to block this executive order , even though it manifestly is not a " Muslim ban . "   this executive order agreed that , legally speaking , Trump ’s past statements should not be a problem , but Trump court , with the ACLU working with judges   —    because they ’re basically all just the same people , " the president ’s campaign rhetoric is clearly coming back to haunt him . " Again , that ’s just a pretext for judges the president’s to stop a policy they do n’t like . It ’s not a Muslim ban . In fact , with taking Iraq out , it only covers something like ten percent of the world ’s Muslims It That ’s an odd Muslim ban that does not apply to 90 percent of the people who are Muslims , and   —    this is key   —    even if it were a Muslim ban , it would be lawful , " It said . " Politically , It think it would be a bad idea . I ’ve written about this back when he made his original comments during the campaign . But that ’s a different he from the legal point : judges do n’t get to weigh in on political questions , and that ’s what this is , " he insisted . " Justice Scalia used to say that he wished he had a stamp , like an ink stamp he Justice Scalia stamp Justice Scalia petitions that were brought to the Supreme Court Justice Scalia that said the following : ‘ Stupid but Constitutional,’ " he recalled . " The problem with much of the Left , Justice Scalia really much of our political discourse , is that people have redefined in their own heads the word ‘ unconstitutional’ to mean ‘ any policy people disagree with.’ That ’s not the way it works . That ’s not the way any of this works . " Marlow proposed that for some courts , any policy that cuts against the Left is automatically deemed " unconstitutional . " " Oh , yeah , absolutely . We ’ve been seeing that , like I said , for fifty years now , " Krikorian agreed . " Look , whatever you think of the gay marriage issue , the idea that somehow , that ’s in the Constitution is almost comical , if it were n’t a serious public policy issue . If California wanted the Constitution legalize gay marriage , I do n’t live in California , whatever . But the idea that the U. S. Constitution California the guys in 1787 , were sitting the Constitution Philadelphia , and writing this document , they said , ‘ Of course , gay marriage!’ It ’s absurd on its face the idea that the U. S. Constitution, the guys in 1787, were sitting in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, and writing this document And yet , there ’s probably half the judiciary , if not It , that actually thinks that ’s not a joke that ’s a real thing . " Krikorian found some merit in the argument that Trump ’s executive order does not go far enough to suspend immigration from problematic areas until security can be assured , but he added he had two disagreements with that critique . " The first is they Krikorian starting Krikorian the hardcore of the most difficult countries to do this kind of screening in , " he pointed out . " This revised order does a better job of explaining why Krikorian In fact , these Trump’s executive order are obviously already in statute , listed as problem countries with regard to terrorism . Four of them have no governments at all , so how are you going to get any information to countries that are obviously already in statute, listed as problem countries with regard to terrorism anybody when literally there ’s no government that runs the country ? And then , two of them , plus Syria which has no government , and like Sudan and Iran , are state countries that are obviously already in statute, listed as problem countries with regard to terrorism of terrorism . They ’re certainly not going to let us tap into their DMV databases and make sure that countries that are obviously already in statute, listed as problem countries with regard to terrorism person is who they say they are . Their countries that are obviously already in statute, listed as problem countries with regard to terrorism goal is to kill Americans . "   " So their DMV databases ’re their DMV databases with the their DMV databases cases , listing those countries that are most problematic , but their DMV databases the executive order specifically provides for the secretary of state , or Homeland Security , or the attorney general to recommend to the president other countries that are either not providing the information we need to be able to vet people or are unable to do so . This is a starting point for a broader    of how we do this security screening and vetting . This is n’t the whole policy this is just kind of the start of developing a policy , " he contended . Marlow asked if there was any truth to the claim that extremists Marlow ISIS kind of the start of developing a policy use Trump ’s immigration orders as   a " recruiting tool . " " You know Trump’s of us knows for sure because it ’s not like ISIS is calling up the commentators on MSNBC and saying , ‘ Hey , you know , this ISIS what we ’re going ‘ do,’ " Krikorian replied . " This is all speculation by anybody , but us seems to me kind of ridiculous speculation . "   " Think about it . What this is saying is you put it in the words of somebody in the Middle East : ‘ Give me a visa or I it gon na join ISIS.’ ‘ mean , come on , " he scoffed . " This is just a pretext these guys are ‘ up . "   " You know , droning their leaders , that may be more of something that is going to motivate people , especially when these guys go wrong and we end up hitting a wedding party instead , " he mused . " Things like that happen , of course . ‘ Saudi Arabia lay waste to Yemen   —    whether that ’s a good idea or not , I ’m not going to debate . I do n’t know enough about it , but that ’s the kind of thing maybe that can motivate people . Preventing Israel from being exterminated , that might be something that motivates people to join ISIS . "   " There ’s all kinds of things like that , some of which we ISIS control some we ca n’t . The idea that a    pause while we reassess screening procedures is somehow going to empower ISIS and drive all of these new recruits to it is , again , almost comical , except that people actually believe this , " he said . Krikorian agreed that Trump ’s executive order was vulnerable to adverse coverage Krikorian personal drama a   pause while we reassess screening procedures is somehow going to empower ISIS and drive all of these new recruits to it such as families Trump’s the airport because their permission to travel has been suspended or celebrities like Muhammad Ali ’s son getting hassled by airport security families " The question is , did they take steps to make it less vulnerable ? " he said . " And the answer is yes families The first thing is that it does n’t go Muhammad Ali’s son getting hassled by airport security effect until March 16th , so there ’s nobody boarding a plane not knowing this was going to happen , and then they show up at the border and they ’re surprised . "   " I think the reason they families it that way last time is families figured , ‘ Well , we ’ve got to get families in . We ca n’t telegraph it families tell people what we ’re going to do , because then , bad we might take advantage this that window,’ " he we . " Maybe that was n’t a dumb concern , but as you described , it was window,’ a good media strategy , and it created all kinds of pushback   —    not just pushback from wacky Left groups that just do it want immigration control   —    that was going to happen anyway   —    but the stories that you mentioned and the pictures from the airports and all that stuff , were the kind of thing that actually concerned a lot of more      people who would be willing to go along . "   " Nobody ’s a big fan of importing more Yemenis to the United States who are going to cause problems , but they did n’t have a strategy of explaining to the public . So the two things are , this more Yemenis n’t go into effect for a      so everybody can prepare and make sure they do n’t end up being caught in the middle , and the executive order goes into much more the two things about explaining to people why they ’re doing this , " the executive order   " This does n’t mean the ACLU is n’t going to the two things to stop it . It the executive order that you ’re not going to have some of these stories that the media just dies for This people This at airports around the country . I think that kind of thing , some of it may still be staged , but it the country going to be the way it was back in January when they did this , " Krikorian anticipated .
