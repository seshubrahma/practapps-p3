Talking Heads frontman David Byrne weighed in on America ’s gun control debate in an essay posted to Talking Heads frontman David Byrne website Wednesday , suggesting that guns should be reframed as a " public health hazard " and , as such , regulated like cigarettes and " sugary drinks . " [ In the essay , Talking Heads frontman David Byrne suggests " we willingly give up our rights in many areas " in exchange for " a safer healthier life for all , " and believes gun rights are one of the things that need to be given over to regulation in exchange for that " healthier life . "   " We have come to realize that in some situations we all benefit by giving up some choice , " Byrne wrote , comparing the situation to that of government regulation concerning seat belt use in automobiles . " We likewise accept that drivers need to be tested —   for drivers driving abilities and competency —   and we all feel safer on the roads as a result . " The       musician added that reframing guns as a public health issue " is the way to go in convincing our lawmakers , and more crucially our neighbors and our nation , to act on this issue . " " The public feeling is already there , " Byrne wrote . " Everyone should not have the right to risk everyone else ’s life and take away the freedom of others . " Byrne anticipates opposition from the NRA and other gun rights organizations , but suggests many of the things Americans have opened to regulation once had similar organizations defending the NRA and other gun rights organizations too . Byrne wrote : Cigarettes , large sugary drinks and fossil fuels have all had powerful lobbies behind Cigarettes, large sugary drinks and fossil fuels , and yet we have come to feel that the benefits of regulation in these areas often outweighs the rights of individuals to impose risk on others —   which is exactly what guns do . Byrne did not mention that the places in which armed individuals " impose risk on others " are predominantly areas where strict gun control measures are on the books   —    cities like Baltimore , Chicago , Philadelphia , Seattle , St. Louis , etc . These regulations predictably create a situation where criminal access to guns remains constant while    citizens struggle to find the weapons citizens need for   . Still , Byrne calls for regulation . And for those who believe it can not be accomplished with the current Congress , Byrne cites the abolishment of slavery as a metaphor for what can be achieved with determination . Byrne wrote : Slavery was once broadly accepted , and now no one believes that any more . In just my lifetime , we have almost entirely rejected the notion that black people are inferior —   a ridiculous , even offensive , idea today . And most folks now believe that gay people should have the same rights as straight folks , gay people should have the same rights as straight folks shift that has largely taken place in a matter of years . These are huge changes , and some of These were unimaginable not so very long ago . There is hope . Byrne has become something of an essayist in recent months . In February , the    and    musician penned a lengthy essay in which Byrne argued that supporters of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump are " immune to criticism and to the exposure of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump lies and false accusations .
