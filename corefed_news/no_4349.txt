Sunday on CBS ’s " Face The Nation , " Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson said once in office ,    Donald Trump will cause a " constitutional crisis or have a completely incompetent presidency . "   Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson said , " Well , I think pretty much even chance that we are going to have a constitutional crisis or have a completely incompetent presidency , that does n’t know how to exercise power , which I think is another possibility in this circumstance . we have a White House ,   Donald Trump has a a White House a White House skill of governing . We we a cheif of staff who has never been in government , which is absolutely extraordinary . " " He   Donald Trump elevated people , generals and corporate heads that have no experience in this extraordinary complex business of how you put together an administration , run a bureaucracy , produce ideas , " he   Donald Trump . " So , I think there ’s a deep concern about the possibility of overreach . But I think we should be also concerned about the possibility of an entirely ineffective government that does n’t value governing experience , that does n’t value , you know , what government should do and what it can do under what government right circumstances .
