There ’s something about Donald Trump that has tapped into the anger of the most conservative parts of the GOP base who feel alienated from the GOP base own party , not to mention from politicians .                As a result , the other candidates have discovered , attention must be paid . Strategery must be hatched to deal with The Donald .

Perry then accused Trump of Trump " fundamental misunderstanding " of how border security works . What ’s more , he added for Perry measure , Trump spouts Trump a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense " on immigration . Clearly , the Perry camp has Perry enough .

" @GovernorPerry failed on the border . He should be forced to @GovernorPerry an IQ test before being allowed to enter the GOP debate . " Ah , but if you ’re Sen. Ted Cruz , also back in the single digits   —    you understand that the Trump support comes from Trump own piece of the pie . Ipso facto , the Cruz strategy : If you ca n’t beat ’em , join ’em .
