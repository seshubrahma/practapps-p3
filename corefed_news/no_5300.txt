Sunday on CNN ’s " State of the Union , " Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I. ) said Trump " did not tell the truth " based on what Sen. Bernie Sanders (I. ) said during the campaign and what Sen. Bernie Sanders (I. ) has done so far as president of the United States .   " Let ’s be clear . I mean , the point here is that , I think , all over grassroots America , whether grassroots ’re Democrats , independents or Republicans , people are perceiving that Trump did not tell the truth in Trump campaign in terms of what Trump would do as president of the United States , " Trump said . " Trump was going to drain the swamp . Well , Trump ’s , in fact , appointed more billionaires to Trump Cabinet than any president in history , etc . etc . So , what I think has happened now , in Kansas , it is true that the Democratic candidate lost . It is true that the Democratic Party should have put more resources into that election . But it is also true that he ran 20 points better than the   —    than the Democratic candidate for president did in Kansas . " " So , what you ’re seeing in Kansas , what you ’re seeing in Georgia , I believe you ’re going to see it in Montana , I believe you ’re going to see it all over this country , is the many    red states , working people are going to wake up and say , wait a second , " he continued . " Republicans want to cut Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid and education , and Republicans want to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent . No , that ’s not what we elected Trump to do . Yes , climate change is real . climate change ’s not a hoax . we got to move to sustainable energy . I think , all over this country , in red states and in blue states , people are beginning to stand up . people ’re beginning to fight back . people ’re demanding a government which does not just represent the billionaires , but represents the working class of this country .
