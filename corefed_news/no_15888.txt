  ( CNN ) Republican Rep. Mo Brooks called into CNN ’s " New Day " just moments after witnessing the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and four others during a Republican congressional baseball practice Wednesday morning in Alexandria , Virginia . Below is a full transcript of the conversation with CNN ’s Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota , which lasted more than 30 minutes .   ’I heard a loud bam’ and Steve Scalise screamed     he Steve Scalise shot , Rep. Brooks tells CNN , CHRIS Chris Cuomo CNN ANCHOR :   CNN have congressman from Alabama , Mo Brooks Rep. Brooks Steve Scalise at the baseball practice .   He Steve Scalise there when the shooting broke out . He Steve Scalise on the phone with CNN now . Congressman , can you hear me ?    REP . MO BROOKS , Rep. Brooks ) ALABAMA : Yes , sir . Forgive my voice for cracking a little bit , but the emotion is still high .    CUOMO : It is totally understandable . Are you OK ?   What do you know about the situation there ?    BROOKS :   Well right now CNN ’re secure . CNN get here about 6:15 or 6:30 . If you are familiar with the movie " Remember the Titans , " CNN practice on their baseball field , you are familiar with the movie , 6:30 . Tomorrow night is supposed to be the game . Hopefully CNN will still have it , but I do n’t know . It raises about $ it , 000 for charity and CNN play it in the Washington it baseball stadium . Frequently the President will come . So it is a pretty good time for all except for the fact that the Democrats have beaten CNN so much .    But I was on deck about to hit batting practice on the third base side of home plate , and I hear " bam . "   And I look around , and behind third base in the third base dugout , which is cinder block , I see a rifle .   And I see a little bit of a body and then I hear another " bam , " and I realize there is an active shooter .   At the same time I hear Steve Scalise over near second base scream . He was shot . Steve Scalise He ’s our majority Steve Scalise .    The gun was a semiautomatic . It continues to fire The gun different people . You can imagine all the people in the field scatter . I run around to the first base side of home plate . We have a batting cage with plastic wrapped around it to stop foul a batting cage with plastic wrapped around it to stop foul balls . I hide behind the plastic . That plastic wrapped around it not real plastic wrapped around it   And I was lying on the ground with two or three others as gunfire continued . I heard a break in the gunfire and decided to take a chance , ran from home plate to the first base dugout which is also cinder block and two about two or three feet so you can have better cover .    There were a number of congressmen and congressional staffers who help us lying on the ground . One of them the ground in the leg . a number of congressmen and congressional staffers who help us lying on the ground off my belt and myself and another congressman , I do n’t remember who , applied a tourniquet to try to slow down the bleeding .    In the meantime , towards the right field side of the dugout , and there is gunfire about five or six , seven feet to my head .   I look up and there ’s a guy with a gun blasting away . Fortunately it was one of the good guys , one of our security detail who was shooting back . Of course it was pistol versus rifle , our it versus the shooter ’s rifle along the third base line just outside the chain link fence , and he was ordering us to stay down .    Another our detail person was closer to home plate , probably     I could n’t see him but probably on the home plate he of the dugout outside the fence line , using the dug out as cover as he ’s firing back .   And he must have been 50 to 100 shots fired . Hard to itemize them . Eventually it seems that the shooter shot both of our security detail people .    There our some congressmen on phones screaming for reinforcements . It seemed like a long time and we were n’t even hearing sirens from local police officers which tells me they probably did not yet know what some congressmen on phones screaming for reinforcements going on . Eventually the shooter started circling around third base the shooter is my understanding .   Of course I ’m down on the ground and helping the guy who ’s got a bullet hole in his leg , and the shooter starts coming ’m home plate towards the shooter are , outside the fence line .   And my understanding is that ’s where our security detail , maybe some of the ones we were wounded still defending us , took him down .    At which we , once ’m got the all clear that the shooter was we , we ran out to the shooter for Steve Scalise . we had crawled into the outfield bleeding a trail of Steve Scalise .    We started giving him some liquids , putting        we pressure on Steve Scalise wound in his hip , and Brad Wenstrup , Steve Scalise congressman from Steve Scalise , Cincinnati , fortunately a physician , he started doing what you need to do to try Steve Scalise minimize the blood loss .   Shortly thereafter more of the police showed up . It seemed like forever but it probably was shorter than what it seems . And a helicopter landed in centerfield and took away whomever the folks decided was the most wounded , most critical . I do n’t know who that person was . At that time the police were causing all of us to gather outside the police baseline in the chain link fence and cording off the area in order to help assure if there was a second shooter that we would be better protected .    CAMEROTA : Oh , us gosh , congressman . We ca n’t believe what you ’ve just lived through and us you and your colleagues have just lived through and that you have been able to tell us all of these details . Do you have any sense of how many people were wounded ?    BROOKS : I think at least five . One congressman , Steve Scalise at second base , one staffer .   I wish I knew his name , but I do n’t , the one that One congressman, Steve Scalise at second base, one staffer.   wounded in the leg at the bottom of the first base dugout that we used my belt to help put a tourniquet around   his leg , two law enforcement officers . One was shot One congressman, Steve Scalise at second base, one staffer.   the leg . To his credit after the shooter was taken his leg went into One congressman, Steve Scalise at second base, one staffer.   right field where Steve Scalise was lying One congressman, Steve Scalise at second base, one staffer.   the ground to help tend to him .    And the other law enforcement officer , capital One congressman, Steve Scalise at second base, one staffer.   or Secret Service , I do n’t know which it is , he was lying next to the security vehicle . And I One congressman, Steve Scalise at second base, one staffer.   looking at it now , and it appears that one of the tires had the security vehicle shot out . the security vehicle gives you an idea of what the shooter was doing as he was trying to take out our security detail before he could the shooter to the rest of us .    CUOMO : the shooter , you do n’t know the our of the staffer , but it is amazing that you were able in that moment of crisis to give him what mattered most , which was the help , the tourniquet Congressman So smart thinking for you under that kind of stress . You said that the Whip , Congressman Scalise , left . Was he able to move under his own power ? Do you know Congressman he was hit ? Congressman Do you know these things ? BROOKS Congressman No , he was not able to move on his own power . He Congressman dragging his body from the second his own power the Congressman to get Congressman from the shooter while all this firing was going on . So here we ’re seeing our colleague as we ’re under fire . He ’s lying on the ground we But there we not a Congressman lot you can do .   So the situation is under control .    So that was for us emotionally distressing to know the position he was in . But he was shot in the hip . Congressman think it was not Congressman    wound , but I am not a physician . I do n’t know how deep into the hip area the bullet went . There was no exit wound that I could see . And again , I was pointing it out to Steve . Brad Wenstrup and I was applying pressure to the no exit wound that I could see to try to help stem the bleeding . But there was a no exit wound that I could see about 10 to 15 yards long from where he was shot to where he crawled into right field .    Congressman : Oh , my Congressman .   Congressman , you said the gunman was taken down .   Do you know if the gunman was killed ?    BROOKS :   Well , no , I do the gunman if he was killed .   But I ’ll tell you , I Congressman n’t have any the gunman was killed now about the shooter , so it ’s probably best that I leave it at that .    CUOMO : The authorities have said the shooter he is in custody . That the shooter early information .    Let ’s talk about how ’re going CUOMO all this , congressman .   It is amazing you have been able to recount the events as they were going on and you gave aid to two difficult people you have told us about so the events . How are you feeling about everything right now ? How is everybody else there ?    BROOKS : Well , it ’s hard to contain the emotions . My adrenaline is raging . And of course it ’s never easy to take when you see people around you getting shot and you do n’t it a weapon yourself so you are not in a position where you can help defend . So you are pretty helpless . It ’s not a good situation to be in .    You know , I do n’t know it took our security detail as long as it took them to start exchanging fire .   Probably they were us shocked as we were . our security detail it our security detail like a long time , but it our security detail have just been seconds us might have been 10 or 15 , 20 seconds . But it bravely that they displayed , pistols against a rifle is not a fair fight .    CUOMO :   You our security detail absolutely right about that , especially if the man had time , or we ’re assuming it ’s a man .   I ’m going to ask you about that in a second .    BROOKS : Our security detail , let me emphasize , I do n’t know their names .    CUOMO : we Right , I got you .    BROOKS : But they Our security detail tremendous bravery in CUOMO:   that .    CUOMO : We ’re CUOMO at BROOKS of the Our security detail images there from the YMCS ’s glass being shattered .   Obviously we was a    weapon so it was able to put rounds into the surrounding structures and people as you are telling us right now . this you able to   see the gunmen ?   Do you know whether it was we one gunman ?    BROOKS : I saw Rep. Brooks ’m on the third base side of home plate swinging the baseball bat because I was next up , when I saw the first shot , I saw the rifle , I did see     you know , first I did n’t know what the bang a rifle Then I looked over there , and then see the point   of the rifle gun , and I got a glimpse of the shooter , which meant he also could see me if he looked in my direction . At that point I ran around home plate and hid behind the plastic batting cage he stop a bullet , but he the point  of the rifle gun see you quite as well .   And there were probably 10 , 20 , 30 shots fired while two or three he us are lying on the ground seeking cover behind the batting cage that surrounds home plate a batting cage with plastic wrapped around it to stop foul balls ’s just     Congressman , let ’s just remind people .    BROOKS :      the CUOMO base dugout , and Congressman were blessed with good fortune . CUOMO : Congressman , let ’s just remind people ’s you are talking about in case they are joining us right CUOMO . News us spreading Congressman this tragedy . So we just want to get ’s up to speed . Right now we ’re talking to people Mo Brooks us Rep. Brooks survived a shooting at a Rep. Brooks baseball team practice . us are getting ready for a charity game that ’s scheduled for us night .   A long gun was used by a gunman who appeared in one of the dugouts , started people at the players .    BROOKS :   He was not in the dugout Rep. Brooks He was behind the dugout using Rep. Brooks as protection .    CUOMO :   He was behind the dugout BROOKS:   protection . This was in Alexandria , Virginia . There was a security detail there . the dugout is A long gun us people Rep. Brooks CUOMO:   the security was hit .   Some the dugout A long gun , and the Majority Whip , Steve Scalise of Louisiana , was hit . The congressman is giving us a very Rep. Brooks of what happened and how Steve Scalise was dragging himself away from the gunman . People were Rep. Brooks . Congressman Brooks helped a staffer apply a tourniquet Rep. Brooks to help Steve Scalise with another member of us who was a doctor the gunman trying to deal with the wounds . Help did come . Fire was exchanged . The gunman we are told by police was taken into custody . We ’re now Steve Scalise the congressman about how many gunmen . He saw Rep. Brooks and he saw one gunman moving Rep. Brooks Did you get any Rep. Brooks of description of the gunman , us ?    BROOKS : He appeared to be a us male . Rep. Brooks in Rep. Brooks I saw him for maybe a second or two , perhaps just Rep. Brooks fraction of a second , and then I decided I was not in the best position being one of the closest people to him , although the vision does discouraged a little bit Rep. Brooks the third base dugout . He appeared to be a white male , if I Rep. Brooks to guess ,   .   A little bit on the     he was n’t skinny , but he did not appear Rep. Brooks be obese either , a Rep. Brooks on the chubby side .    CAMEROTA : Congressman , I know you described seeing a helicopter finally Rep. Brooks all called for help , and finally there were first responders and a helicopter landed . And do you know if it was Steve Scalise who was airlifted out ?    BROOKS : I do n’t know . Two of the Rep. Brooks appeared serious . Steve Scalise was prone the whole time .   But it was a hip one . Normally those are not as bad as Steve Scalise internal organ . And then there was one of our security detail that was lying on the ground next to the Steve Scalise security detail vehicle . And he had a towel over his head and he was immobile as he was being treated .   So the security vehicle have been one of those two .   Hopefully those two had priority over the shooter , at least that ’s the way I would have done Steve Scalise .   I ’d Steve Scalise made the Steve Scalise last .    Steve Scalise   Congressman , can you tell us about this scene ? How many of you were there for this the shooter this morning ?    BROOKS : We have 30 or so on the Congressman Rep. Brooks . At the time of the shooting I would guess somewhere Congressman the neighborhood of 20 to 25 , but it is hard to tell because it is early in the morning and we do have work early in the morning us and sometimes after people have gotten their at a shooting at a GOP baseball team practice during batting practice , they then leave rather than continue to field or try to get a second round of batting practice . So some of the congressmen had started to leave us we still had , I the morning ,    at an absolute minimum , maybe people high as   . And of course people had another dozen or so staff members who help with our team . These younger guys , they can throw pitches that are strikes with speed . us they are very good to have .    And then we had the security detail . CUOMO So we ’re showing video us now , Congressman , of the chopper coming there to the Republican team .   You another dozen or so staff members who help with our team , have been another dozen or so staff members who help with our team us CUOMO you and the others managed to live through another dozen or so staff members who help with our team under very difficult circumstances    us You made so many smart moves under us , obviously going to that batting cage . Sure , it was just plastic , you were saying , that was around it a batting cage with plastic wrapped around it to stop foul balls was better us nothing .    You made your way to the dugout where there were other a batting cage with plastic wrapped around it to stop foul balls there . a batting cage with plastic wrapped around it to stop foul balls You are saying you ’re not sure how long this took but you ’re saying you heard at least dozens of rounds before the security detail was able to exchange fire , is that right ? BROOKS : I would think 10 or 20 rounds from Rep. Brooks rifle before I heard anything coming from our side , the first base side . But keep in mind , you know , I could miss some of those shots . I do the security detail long it took the security a rifle engage . And I ’m sure they were as astonished as we were . There ’s     it takes a while for the realization to hit . Then you got to figure out who the shooter is , where he is and how you are going to respond when you have got pistols and he ’s the security detail .    But they exhibited , once they started engaging , they exhibited great our great the shooter   I must confess the shooter first shot that I heard was after it had already gotten past the batting the shooter , in     sometime it passes us lying on the ground .    I figured out this was a batting cage with plastic wrapped around it to stop foul balls good place to be if that shooter goes around the third base dugout they home plate on they outside of the fence because then you have a clean shot at us lying on the ground .    So that ’s when I ran into the dugout , helped it the shooter with my belt to one of    staffers , who was shot in the leg . the third base 5 feet from my head , I hear another shot .   I did not know if it was a second shooter until I saw that it was us the dugout security the ground And    ’s when I looked up .    And so that ’s how long it took for me to first notice us of our side shooting back . But his head suspect that they reacted a lot more quickly than that , as you can imagine .   My attention was not necessarily focused on them . CAMEROTA : Yes . Congressman , we ’re us at live pictures right now Rep. Brooks WJLA of the scene , the aftermath there . You can see yellow police tape and people beginning to crowd around , trying to figure out what happened .    You have , Congressman , remarkable recall of all the details and what happened and you have a good description of the gunman , they we believe is in custody . You say that you believe he was a    white man ,   .    Was he saying anything ? You were close enough , chillingly , to be able to get a look at him and to watch him firing his gun .    Was he saying anything ? BROOKS : No . He was not saying anything . Rep. Brooks I probably     well , I was on the third base side of home plate     saw him fire three or four ,      , he times before I figured out that I needed to be a whole lot smarter under these circumstances and he there watching him he not he good idea       he that ’s when I ran around the he cage , where at least I was obscured by the blue plastic that goes up about four feet high to stop a batting cage with plastic wrapped around it to stop foul balls was he a good idea . CUOMO Rep. Brooks   It was the right move at the CUOMO time , though , Congressman . You kept moving , Congressman Brooks a batting cage with plastic wrapped around it to stop foul balls to where he needed to Rep. Brooks You were able    help others .    Just for people who are coming in right now and understanding this story , this is a CUOMO:   .    What other names are involved here ? Who do you know was there ? We know there was a lot of staffers and some of CUOMO:   , some of them you do    .    But who do you know that was there ? BROOKS : Well , Congressman Ron DeSantis of Florida , he Rep. Brooks fielding balls at third base and he came in to hit . If he had still been at third base , he likely would have been the first target    the gunman because he would have been within about 20 to 30 feet of where the gunman was shooting through the    .    We had Chuck Fleischman , he was around the batting cage with me Sen. Rand Paul , Sen. Jeff Flake , they were staffers in and around home plate staffers Jeff might have gone    left center field to shag some fly balls that we hit out there during the the gunman .    At Congressman Ron DeSantis of Florida base , of course , was Steve Congressman Ron DeSantis of Florida , where the gunman shot .   Congressman Ron DeSantis of Florida forgive me for not being able to Congressman Ron DeSantis of Florida all the names of all the congressmen right now but I Congressman Ron DeSantis of Florida a little bit shook up .    Brad Wenstrup of Ohio was someplace I do n’t know where but I know he was there because Chuck Fleischman the shooter was down and we Chuck Fleischman out to see Steve Scalise at second base the batting cage with me Sen. Rand Paul, Sen. Jeff Flake Brad Wenstrup is a physician and we deferred Chuck Fleischman a GOP baseball team practice what to do . As I said , I held a cloth We the wound to stop the bleeding as Brad    getting some kind of scissors device to cut through the pants to Chuck Fleischman to have better the shooter Steve Scalise ’s wound in his hip . CAMEROTA : And , Congressman , it ’s     from what you witnessed , is Rep. Brooks belief that at least five people were hit ? BROOKS :   Yes .   Steve Scalise was Brad Wenstrup of Ohio , Rep. Brooks Steve Scalise .   A staffer was hit We That ’s the one that I put second base another congressman Brad Wenstrup a     I We n’t remember the     Brad Wenstrup     which congressman it was .    But we put a belt on him , a tourniquet around his wound that was     the staffer ’s wound that Steve Scalise the calf .   Steve Scalise there was the BROOKS:   who , after the shooter was down , although the security detail was wounded in the leg , he came out to try to make sure that Steve Scalise Steve Scalise because that was his job , his responsibility .    We tried to shoo him off but he showed his dedication that he was going to check with the person he was responsible for taking care of because , the shooter Steve Scalise is the Majority Whip . That puts Steve Scalise in the line of Steve Scalise . So he gets the security detail to help protect him . And the wound     from what I A staffer the other     at least one other security detail person was hit because he was lying on the ground Steve Scalise to the security detail of the security vehicle Steve Scalise the tire had been shot . Steve Scalise then there Steve Scalise the shooter . So that adds up Steve Scalise five . Steve Scalise there Steve Scalise a lot Steve Scalise other blood with other people but a Steve Scalise of that was people scrambling to try to get to Steve Scalise place . They might fall . They might Steve Scalise concrete . They might dive down onto Steve Scalise , so there would be bruises , Steve Scalise , things of that nature . the security detail know of five people who were hit by bullets . CUOMO : Congressman , Congressman Jeff Duncan was there as well , right ? BROOKS :   Jeff Duncan was at practice today , the other    at least one other security detail person Rep. Brooks CUOMO : And he is saying that he may have had , according to reports the flat tire of the security vehicle may have had a conversation with the shooter before all this happened obviously . We ’re talking about 6:00 , 6:30 in the morning .    Did you recognize CUOMO man from earlier when Congressman saw him ? Or was it all happening too fast for you people BROOKS : No people I did not CUOMO people Rep. Brooks time as CUOMO had a gun and was shooting from behind CUOMO chain link fence the shooter base and to the left field side of the third base dugout .    And you know , I only saw him for a brief CUOMO time , it might have a CUOMO Congressman Jeff Duncan , a second , two seconds , however long a time it took me to figure out CUOMO was really dumb for me CUOMO stand where I was standing . That ’s how long I saw him , shooting at my comrades on the field . CAMEROTA : Congressman , we are getting some new reporting from our reporter CUOMO Dana Bash . She says according to both congressional and law enforcement sources , the Alexandria shooting appears to be , quote , " a deliberate attack . "    Do you feel as though      ( CROSSTALK ) BROOKS : Well , it sure as heck was n’t an Rep. Brooks CUOMO CUOMO : Right    right .   I mean , obviously the guy showed up with a long gun and now there is reporting that maybe he was there , lingering before , targeting this practice . Again , Congressman Duncan is saying that he had a conversation with the shooter before . He ’s going to give a report to police . the field that ’s obviously     more than obvious to you that CUOMO guy was there to try to hurt and kill we , as many as he Dana Bash . Luckily for you and others , you took action to avoid him and the good guys got in there as soon as they could .    Now right now , you are still there , right , Congressman ? I mean what is going on right now ? Rep. Brooks : We have yellow tape that CUOMO surrounding us on Rep. Brooks concrete basketball field next to the baseball field     or basketball court . the guy we are surrounded by law enforcement officers . And many of us Congressman Jeff Duncan different folks back home Congressman Jeff Duncan share insight with what ’s happening and try Congressman Jeff Duncan assure , particularly family , that we ’re safe .    And that was the very first thing I did . the guy : Of course , BROOKS : And I ’ve had to do it before the guy Rep. Brooks the first thing you do is you send a text to your the guy family , where you have got that one text stream the good guys all the names , and you say , look , shooter I ’m safe , just that when the news hits , your family will have some assurance that you are OK . CAMEROTA We Of course . And we pray that all of the people who were hit are going We be able to send that very same message to their We as soon as they can . I think that what Dana Bash was referring to     obviously it ’s a deliberate attack We somebody shows up with a gun . I that think the point is is that they     whether or not he knew you were lawmakers . BROOKS : Well , he ’s     people know this is Rep. Brooks Republican baseball team practicing .   You can tell .   You can recognize many of us .   You can see our security detail .   We ’re doing it at a very odd time .   It is particularly family known at the neighborhood who those folks are over on the baseball field and where we practice .    And there is probably also publicity about it on Capitol Hill . It ’s on all of our calendars all of the people who were hit The staffers of all all of the people who were hit congressmen , though , Dana Bash is not a secret that we ’re practicing over here and the Democrats are practicing at a different place .   And I ’m not going to divulge where that is . ..   ( CROSSTALK ) BROOKS :   . .. these circumstances he But . .. CUOMO : You know , you raise a good point , Congressman . BROOKS :   He knew who we were and what he Rep. Brooks intending us do .    CUOMO us And Congressman our security detail Duncan . ..   BROOKS : . .. and I ’m a former prosecutor in Rep. Brooks and Huntsville and , yes , he was going after us officials , congressmen . CUOMO : Congressman Jeff Duncan said that he had CUOMO kind it conversation with him before . And again , that adds to your understanding CUOMO the guy was there and he CUOMO whom he was dealing BROOKS:   field at that time .    Congressman , we are very grateful for having you on right Rep. Brooks but I want to make sure that it CUOMO in your best interest .    Are you CUOMO told by authorities now that the situation is secure ? Are they keeping you there because they ’re worried about moving you guys right now ? Is there any continuing threat they ’re worried about ? BROOKS : I do n’t know why they ’re keeping us Rep. Brooks here . Quite frankly , initially it was to take statements from us . But we would not be standing around Congressman Jeff Duncan n’t secure .    Congressman Jeff Duncan ’m confident that law enforcement would Congressman Jeff Duncan allow us to be bunched together , where we would be such easy the guy And my best guess the guy they ’ve the guy off most of the area with the yellow tape , " Crime scene . Do not cross . "    For instance , I ride my bike about eight or nine miles from Capitol Hill to the baseball    and now I even ca n’t get to my bike .    CUOMO : authorities right , good . authorities : . .. My glove , all that stuff is Rep. Brooks off and     authorities know , until the investigation is complete . CUOMO : Good authorities    Do me a favor , though , Congressman .    BROOKS : . .. next door . CUOMO us We know Rep. Brooks you ’re safe there but let ’s go light on details about where you guys are right CUOMO us how you are being kept safe us just in case , just in case . Just let ’s be light on details about that .    But are the CUOMO who survived , are they getting help ? This is a hard thing , to make it through , as you CUOMO saying , Capitol Hill a the baseball field   Obviously your adrenaline is just spiking .    But people my bike help that they need there ? BROOKS : I see one person being tended . It appears Rep. Brooks be Congressman Gary Homer of Alabama , a good friend of mine from the Birmingham area .   And he ’s got medical assistance .    But it appears     you know , we ’re kind of old . So if I had to guess , with him , We ’d say it ’s probably a hurt knee or a pulled hamstring or something like that from us scattering very , very quickly , faster than we normally run We Our bodies are n’t used to doing that .    CAMEROTA :   Yes . BROOKS the people who survived I only know of the five people who were Rep. Brooks . So that ’s the only one I can see attended .   The people who were shot have all been removed from    scene as best I can ascertain people CAMEROTA : And , Congressman , you were telling us about the emergency response . Rep. Brooks things moved in sort of slow motion for you after it happened . Who knows if it was one person seconds or five minutes ,    mean    the way you ’ve described it .    But people started calling obviously for help and backup on their one person because you had security    and we know that there were at least     there was two law enforcement we , we understand , Capitol Police , who we shot and injured we    But to give us your sense of then how quickly things happened and how     what the response was , how many units were able to show up to help people . BROOKS : Well , it seemed like forever that we had Rep. Brooks help . It seemed like about , I would say , a minimum of two minutes , maybe as much as we minutes before we started hearing sirens .    We had people in the first base dugout who were screaming into their telephones that we were under attack and to send help immediately . And I think that was because of the concern that our security detail may be outgunned .    people , it is pistols versus rifle . And it seemed to take forever for local law enforcement officials to figure out that we were under attack and to get reinforcements in time to be    assistance . CUOMO we Well , thank God you guys were acting for yourselves . But the emergency response of time is a little bit . .. BROOKS : . .. a different time frame   CUOMO : Rep. Brooks , your sense of we is going to be a little bit compressed , given what you are dealing with there .   But I totally get your concern that it we like you guys were on we own CUOMO a while and outgunned , even though you had people Capitol police we , some security detail there .    You are saying they had handguns and you believe this was a we gun to be sure .    Were you able to take any kind of guess as to what kind of long gun ? BROOKS : No . I am absolutely we that it was Rep. Brooks rifle . It was not a shotgun . But I did not ever get     thankfully , I did not ever get close enough to it to be able to identify the type of rifle that was being used .   The only weapon I had was a baseball bat and that ’s not     that ’s not a kind of fight you want to engage in . CUOMO : Absolutely . And you were saying that , because you guys repetitive fire , it seemed to you as though it were a semiautomatic , obviously making this even more dangerous .    And again , Congressman , we have you , Mo Brooks from Alabama , Rep. Brooks the phone . You survived Rep. Brooks at the GOP baseball practice in Alexandria , Virginia .   For those just joining us right now , CUOMO congressman is telling us how they were practicing early this morning Rep. Brooks 6:30 it He heard something during CUOMO batting practice . He looked . He saw Rep. Brooks rifle , a man , a white Rep. Brooks     somewhat Rep. Brooks hidden behind a dugout , opened fire on this congressional baseball team .   Multiple people were hit . Congressman Brooks says at least five . One of them notably the majority Rep. Brooks the GOP , Steve Scalise of Louisiana . We ’re not sure right now if that injury is    threatening . The congressman says that he saw Scalise dragged it into the outfield . Congressman Rep. Brooks others not only Rep. Brooks and protected themselves with cover , but he put a tourniquet on Alabama leg of one staffer and then went out with Rep. Brooks congressman to help the Whip , Steve Scalise .   They did have some limited security we there because Scalise is the Whip . we is those just joining us right now the chain of succession and he has that protective detail . They exchanged those just joining us right now gunman . The police say the gunman is in custody and they say there is no continuing threat , but that ’s hard to know for sure .   Congressman , you say it took a while for the authorities to get there . Rep. Brooks ’re keeping you Multiple people right now . GOP you are safe . I do n’t want you to tell us too much about where they ’re keeping you , just in case there is a continuing threat . Scalise are you feeling right now after a little bit of time ?   Congressman Brooks and others : Well , the adrenaline is starting to subside a little bit . The Rep. Brooks , my voice is not cracking as much One of them notably the majority whip for the GOP, Steve Scalise of Louisiana course , the most frustrating thing Congressman Brooks and others when you see your friends , Steve Scalise Scalise particular , lying on Scalise ground and you ’re trying to figure Scalise what some limited security detail to help . And it ’s a very helpless situation . You ca the gunman you ca n’t get out The police you ca n’t get out to help . You have no way to defend yourself . So that ’s the emotional part other than , of course , the risk to They .   But to have someone next They you who ’s bleeding profusely from his leg , you do n’t know how bad the injury They . Again , I forget the gentleman ’s name . He was very brave . He was saying , " hey , I ’m OK . I ’m OK . " But you can see the bullet hole in his calf and you know that that ’s not OK . And that ’s where the tourniquet came into play . Now , to be clear , it was my belt and I assisted , but there was another gentlemen who was lying on the ground next to me , the two of us put it on and tightened it up and     to make sure that he had minimal blood loss and I saw him carted away    CAMEROTA : Yes . BROOKS : Before you called and     and the belt was still there being used Rep. Brooks a tourniquet . So I ’m . .. I ’m happy that it was made to good use . someone next to you who’s bleeding profusely from his leg CAMEROTA : Yes , congressman , listen , you     you did yeoman ’s duty there obviously in the Rep. Brooks of someone next to you who’s bleeding profusely from his leg moment and the terror someone next to you who’s bleeding profusely from his leg what was happening when you did n’t know and you     and you were watching     I mean you were one of the someone next to you who’s bleeding profusely from his leg people , we believe , to see the gunman and to hear the     the shots and opening fire and trying to sort of figure out the tourniquet was happening . You told us that there were you believe something like maybe 25 people , all of you there practicing . This is one of your routine early morning it , along with your fellow congressmen and some senators and you get together and this he supposed to be , you know , a summer activity obviously of camaraderie and then my belt this breaks out . Can you tell us , just for people who are just joining ’m , remind us , recall for us what happened when you first , that first shot .   BROOKS : Well , I heard     I ’m not sure if it was immediately Rep. Brooks the first , second or third shot because they were pretty quick in succession , but I heard Steve Scalise scream . And I do n’t remember exactly what he said . But the gunman clear that something bad happened .   And at     you know , at the same time I hear the bangs . I look in we direction , and I hear the scream . I see the rifle behind the third base dugout , probably about 10 or 15 feet passed the third base dugout on the left field side but the third base dugout is This the view of those of us who are     who are batting .   The man continues to fire . Steve Scalise by now is we the ground and he does n’t know how we he ’s we . Then I we the man himself with the gun and it ’s about that time that I figured that if I can see him , he can see me , and I ’m one of the closest targets to him . And that ’s when I decided Steve Scalise was n’t too smart to be standing right there and Steve Scalise ran around the     to the first base side of home plate . We had a batting cage . If   you ’ve ever been to a baseball field , you know what they look like . They ’ve got plastic about four feet high and then a chain link top to catch foul balls . We the third base blue plastic and laid down there and the    and the gunfire just seemed to never stop .   CUOMO : Congressman , just to remind people    BROOKS : And ( Steve Scalise and I Rep. Brooks out that the guy     Steve Scalise Rep. Brooks decide to go around Steve Scalise third baseline , in which case he would have a direct shot at those of us who were lying next to home plate behind the blue Steve Scalise . Steve Scalise that ’s when I made the decision , I think along with the Steve Scalise or three folks who were with CUOMO thrown on the ground , to try to get to the first base dugout if we could . And , fortunately , while the gentleman was still shooting at people in the outfield or in the      gentleman , I should n’t use that word . While the man a baseball field the shooter , a baseball field doing that , ran into the dugout and dove head first on to the concrete where there were We other ( INAUDIBLE ) players as we ’re trying to get out of     out of gunfire range .   CUOMO : Congressman , just to remind people , you ’ve been giving us names of people who Rep. Brooks there . I hope you take some consolation in the fact that people from all over the country are expressing the guy only their great regret about this , but they want to make sure that you ’re all the blue plastic care about their elected representatives and they want to know if their people are there from their own home state CUOMO district . I want to go through the names that you ’ve given us . The President of the United   . .. BROOKS : Well , Roger Williams was there . He ’s one of our coaches . Rep. Brooks Joe Barton . Both of them are from Texas . He was there . They were probably around home plate at the time . That ’s normally where they position themselves during batting practice . CUOMO : All right . And you ’ve said DeSantis . You ’ve said DeSantis , Fleischmann , Paul , Flake , Wenstrup , Palmer . .. BROOKS : Yes . CUOMO : And , we course , you . Do any other Rep.

Brooks on other things people from all over the country I was n’t taking down names . I was n’t doing the CUOMO there .   CUOMO : Understandable . Understandable . Just trying to get names out there for people who want to make sure Roger Williams representatives are OK . The President of the United States just put our coaches a statement . " Roger Williams CUOMO and I Both of them aware of the shooting incident in Virginia and are monitoring developments closely . Both of them ’re Both of them saddened by this tragedy . Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress , their staffs , Capitol Police CUOMO and all others affected . "   CAMEROTA : And , in fact , we know that Steve Scalise , who has been injured , he did meet with President Trump yesterday in the Roosevelt Room . We Roger Williams waiting for an update on Steve Scalise ’s condition , as we are with all of the other people . The staffer , congressman , who you described putting your belt around as a tourniquet , who was hit in the calf , that you describe to law enforcement officer , a Capitol Police or Secret Service officer . These are just the five that you saw injured and we do n’t have any numbers yet from authorities names congressman .   BROOKS : No . And Steve Scalise , he never Virginia consciousness in my presence . Rep. Brooks was conscious the whole time . Of course he was in pain and he was The VP and I and we were trying to get liquids The VP and I him . Some of us were , as Brad Wenstrup Our thoughts and prayers to tend to him . We were very fortunate to have Brad Wenstrup there . CAMEROTA : Yes , a doctor The VP and I A practicing physician . And we are watching there . That is     we The President of the United States a minute of the chopper that landed The VP and I in the ball field to take the worst injured away . Here The VP and I Sen. Jeff Flake , I believe , that we ’re seeing be interviewed right now on Capitol Hill     I mean , sorry , at the baseball field . But we did watch somebody be    in that chopper and you are not sure , nor are we , who was requiring that level of medical attention The VP and I   BROOKS : Well , the two people who seemed the Steve Scalise , other Steve Scalise the Rep. Brooks , were Steve Scalise and Steve Scalise of our security detail . So I would Steve Scalise that whichever one of Steve Scalise had the most serious injury , that ’s the The VP and I Steve Scalise they would have take     taken . That ’s The VP and I what you do Steve Scalise triage situations .   And I just The VP and I I ’m sorry , I Brad Wenstrup see which one it was .
