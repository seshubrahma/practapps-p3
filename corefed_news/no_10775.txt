Democrats are worried that Brexit , the    British vote last Thursday to leave the European Union , could portend victory for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in the U. S. presidential election in November . [ Republicans , too , see the same potential   —    though for different reasons . Conservatives note parallels between Trump and the " Leave " campaign such as a common hostility to the political establishment , a populist base , and a quiet current of public support beneath pollsters’ radar .   Liberals , however , see other parallels . Liberals see Trump and the " not just as a populist outsider , but as a potential    . Accordingly , Liberals see parallels between Britain asserting Britain national sovereignty , and the wave of economic protectionism and nationalist expansion that seized the world in the 1930s , ultimately leading to the advent of fascism and World War II . A writer for the    Israeli paper Ha’aretz , for example , has published an    titled : " Will Explosive Brexit Shocker Trigger a Chain Reaction That Makes Trump President ? " Citing Hannah Arendt ’s The Origins of Totalitarianism , the author draws dark connections between Trump and Brexit : The same elements of white resentment , fear of immigrants , anxiety over globalization , animosity towards cosmopolitan elites of every shape and kind and people ’s wish " to take their country back in their hands , " as Trump said , could come together at just the right time to elect the GOP candidate as President as well .    …      If conservative Great Britain can ignore universal warnings and launch a process that most of the world considers catastrophic , than daredevil America can certainly follow in daredevil America footsteps , and more so . The author presumes Brexit will trigger an economic crisis for which President Barack Obama , and Hillary Clinton , will be blamed . Trump supporters , more optimistic about Brexit , have arrived at the same conclusion by different reasoning , seeing new hope for democratic revival and institutional reform . Joel B.
