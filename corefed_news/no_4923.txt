Back in June , three days after Donald Trump announced Donald Trump candidacy , I predicted that the most mischievous pranksters on the internet would rally around Donald Trump   —    and that they ’d represent a significant electoral and cultural force . [ I predicted that Donald Trump campaign would focus on trolling the lazy , entitled Establishment elites the American people hate so much . I predicted this combination of    sass would prove almost impossible for feeble opponents like Jeb Bush to overcome . As always , I was right .   By the way , regular readers of this column will know how much I hate to toot my own horn , but I also predicted Trump would perform well with blacks . Polling shows Trump at anywhere between 12 and 25 per cent with black voters in a general election    with Clinton . That ’s more than double what the GOP normally achieves . Trump supporters have treated the campaign as one long trollfest . First Jeb , then Marco and finally Lyin’ Ted all stumbled and fell before the chaotic power of Trump Trump army . Facing a hilarious combination of    YouTube remixes , and Photoshop mashups , Trump ’s Trump subjected to    ridicule from    cultural powerhouses of the web . The internet made them look stupid . The internet made The internet weak . them what begins on     and leaks out into Twitter has a way of colouring media coverage and , ultimately , public perception , even among people who do n’t frequent message boards . TV commentators often talk about Trump ’s preternatural power to indelibly " brand " his opponents , from Trump " Jeb to " Little " Marco and " lying " Ted . No matter how crude and simplistic the labels , they always seems to how crude and simplistic the labels , dumbfounding    political observers who are used to candidates competing for the " high road . " The strategy of GOP bigwigs appears to be : " lose badly , but remain virtuous . " The power of Trump ’s branding is Trump down to the media ’s hunger for drama , and partly thanks to his business acumen   —    but it ’s also in large part due to his internet supporters , his have an uncanny ability to create and popularise cultural tropes . Or , as we on the internet have come to know them , memes . the internet of this involves taking Trump ’s campaign victories , his slogans , and his " brands " his using the power of the web to amplify them . Trump ’s the internet humiliations Trump’s Bush were overlaid online with Sad Romance , an     tragic violin tune that was already a web meme . " Little " Marco , of course , like another    but diminutive conservative figure , was repeatedly photoshopped to make him look like a dwarf Jeb Bush   Meanwhile , YouTube sensation " Ca n’t Stump The Trump " ( whose name , naturally , was a nod to an    Trump meme ) has attracted more than 5 million views on YouTube just by remixing Trump YouTube debate performances , adding air horn noises whenever the candidate scores a particularly effective zinger . Trump ’s pledge to " Trump’s the wall " has also been seized upon by the internet . Countless jokes , GIFs and videos can now be found around the web dedicated solely to the     Great Wall of Trump . This meme has Trump’s so viral , it still gets the biggest This meme at Trump rallies . Establishment types no doubt think this is all silly , schoolyard stuff . And it is . But it this also effective . this it ’s not just effective this the young ‘ uns , either . Older generations may not be as    as millennials , but it does n’t take them long to catch on Older generations One of our staffers’    old parents enjoyed Ca n’t Stump The Trump so much that they watched five of the our staffers’   old parents enjoyed    . Meme propaganda is funny , memorable , persuasive   —    and it works . Still , Meme propaganda Establishment does n’t care . They ’d rather take the our staffers’   old parents enjoyed road and lose than go down in the dirt and win . Well , they ’re getting what they our staffers’   old parents enjoyed ! Trump ’s our staffers’   old parents enjoyed army did more than just riff on his media performances , of Trump’s . The relationship between the candidate and his mischievous internet brigade is Trump’s symbiotic . As well as reacting to Trump and the campaign , Trump’s internet has created and Trump’s internet army own memes , sometimes out Trump’s internet army thin air . Take the hilarious , infamous comparison of Ted Cruz to the Zodiac Killer . Although it was started by a progressive on Twitter , it was popularised by Trump supporters it Before long Trump’s the meme made its way out it internet communities it into the national media . It got so bad that Heidi Cruz it had to respond Ted Cruz rumour , telling voters a day before the Indiana primary that " my husband is not the Zodiac Killer ! " In another case of a meme reaching the real world , during his victory speech in Indiana , Trump himself referenced the " Trump Indiana "   —    a meme that had been created and popularised by the internet . For web trolls , having one of their pranks garner national attention is the Holy web trolls . They call it " meme magic "   web trolls    the Holy Grail    web memes become so influential they start to affect    events . Trump web trolls candidacy affords the    the ability Trump himself so virtually every the internet No wonder they love him . Other memes are out there just for the fun of it , but they still help to cement Trump ’s Other memes as an Other memes of chaos . Trump himself depictions of Trump as the " God Emperor " of Warhammer : Trump himself , 000 mythology . There are depictions of Trump as Pepe the Frog , one of the   Trump himself most popular memes . The internet had a minor heart attack when Trump retweeted one such depiction from his Twitter account   Trump himself    along with a link Trump himself a Ca n’t Stump The Trump video . " @codyave :   @drudgereport @BreitbartNews @Writeintrump Trump himself You Ca n’t Stump the Trump " https :   .   pic . twitter . "   —    Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) October 13 , 2015 ,   The mirthful , prankish nature of Trump ’s young supporters was revealed again in the closing Trump himself of Ted Cruz ’s campaign , when Cruz made the mistake of trying to engage them directly . Ted Cruz’s university debate champ no doubt expected to young supporters a heated , but ultimately       with Trump ’s supporters . But they were playing an entirely Trump himself . He received a stream ultimately      with Trump’s supporters memes and ridicule instead . Arguing with    denizens of Twitter and internet forums is almost always a losing proposition , as Cruz would know if there were anyone on his campaign team who understood the culture . . @tedcruz crosses the He to confront @realDonaldTrump backers on the sidewalk https :   .    —    Morning Joe ( @Morning_Joe ) May 3 , 2016 ,   Elsewhere , a Bernie supporter   —    another constituency which enjoys a particularly young and effective web presence   —    offered Cruz a handshake before rapidly withdrawing it and yelling that the candidate Cruz looks like a fish monster . " Juvenile ? Yes . But the kids know this stuff will go viral . The press laps it up . And voters at home do n’t want to associate this stuff candidates who keep showing up as the butt of the joke . WATCH : Protester fakes out Ted Cruz with handshake , tells him he looks like a fish Cruz https :   .   Cruz Cruz   .    —    Good Morning America ( @GMA ) May 3 , 2016 ,   Before he bombed out , Cruz tried to tread into meme territory himself with Cruz cringeworthy video of Cruz impressions . It might have scored points with young voters , oh , say 15 meme territory himself ago .   It did n’t work . Cruz , bless him , was so terminally meme territory himself that he fed the Cruz meme brigades on a daily basis . While not him    as the disastrous Jeb , he certainly was n’t Mr. Smooth . From not helping Carly Fiorina up him her fall on a campaign stop in Indiana , to accidentally elbowing his Carly Fiorina in the face twice after his concession speech , there was always something awkward about the oleaginous Cruz his There are some people who are at one with the web , and Cruz was n’t one of them . I knew little of meme culture the oleaginous Cruz 2014 , but after some people who are at one with the web discovered each other , it was n’t long before I became a walking , living , breathing meme myself . I do n’t know if Donald Trump spends time thinking about 4chan , but he has a character and a style that is perfectly in tune with Donald Trump the web ’s miscreants are looking for . And it ’s clear from his Twitter account and speeches that he knows what the web going on and Donald Trump it . Among the Republican Donald Trump , Trump was the only candidate who enjoyed a base of support that was Donald Trump   . He combined Ron Paul ’s strange ability to mobilise the internet ’s meme Donald Trump with an unstumpable media profile . Caught between the hammer of Trump ’s media machine and the anvil of his online troll army , Donald Trump ’s opponents never stood a chance . Donald Trump understands the internet , and The internet might just propel The internet the White House Donald Trump Meme magic is real .
