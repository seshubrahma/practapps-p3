’     ’ " Editor ’s note : This story was initially published on December    5 , 2016 . This story has been republished below after   on Thursday that Tucker    Carlson will be promoted to the network ’s 9 p. m. time slot    to replace outgoing host Megyn Kelly . " ’    * * * ’ " It was the 7 p. m. hour on Fox News and famed New    York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof found Nicholas Kristof in the hot    seat , forced to defend a column Nicholas Kristof had authored , in part , about      Donald Trump ’s supporters . " ’    " I guess what I’’m here for is empathy , " host Tucker Carlson told famed New   York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof , noting the famed New   York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof an extensive background    traveling to some of the most troubled places on the globe . ’ ’    " I’’ve never read a column by you that suggests famed New   York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof people in    those places   —    who support dictators oftentimes   —    are racists or    bad people , " Carlson said , famed New   York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof he placed a famed New   York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof copy of the    column on the studio’ ’s glass desk . " You would never write that    about a    person in the third world . But you’’re implying that    about your    Americans . " ’ "    Kristof rejected Carlson ’s characterization famed New   York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof his work , famed New   York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof the    newly minted Fox News primetime host , who previously hosted shows    on CNN and MSNBC , calmly pressed forward . " ’    " You’’ve thought a lot about the suffering of people in other    countries . You’’ve thought a You’’ve about it , " You’’ve said . Carlson’s It    doesn’’t seem you’’ve thought that You’’ve about the suffering of    your fellow Americans . " ’ ’    For anyone familiar with Carlson , the Carlson’s he was expressing    on his show , he Tucker Carlson Tonight Carlson’s was not new . His show ,    he premiered in the week after the election , has already    become a standout    Fox News ’’ nightly programming . ’ ’    Carlson , a conservative journalist who most recently founded The    Daily Caller , a    online publication , holds ardent    views about small government , excessive regulation , and a    multitude of other issues typically shared among Republicans . ’ ’    But the issue he perhaps is most ’ ’    about these days cuts    across party lines : He describes it as ’ ’    distaste for elitism ,    particularly among political journalists who reside in the Acela    corridor . ’ ’    " What bothers me is the lack of   . I don’’t know if I    have ever met a group less    than political reporters , "    Carlson told Business Insider in a recent interview . " They    honestly don’’t believe that there are legitimate alternative    views of anything . And like most    and dumb people    they are very , very quick to dismiss anything they don’’t    understand they crazy . " ’ "    Following Trump ’s unforeseen election victory , the journalism    community   hoping to    understand how it had failed to Trump’s a Trump win on the Trump . " ’    One of the immediate conclusions was that reporters had become    too encapsulated in some sort of bubble . They had failed to reporters had become   too encapsulated in some sort of bubble detect , and    understand , the sentiment of Americans residing    in the heartland . ’ ’    That was a conclusion with which Carlson wholeheartedly agreed . ’ ’    Referencing a widely circulated   in which he suggested    conservative voters were stuck in a bubble and only accepting    news from    sources , Carlson said the same Carlson true of    the mainstream media . ’ ’   ’ ’    " It’ ’s the mirror image of the world I live in , " Carlson said . " Carlson    Washington , no one believes anything unless it comes from The New    Yorker , New York Times editorial page , or The Washington Post .    There’ ’s not just one bubble . " ’ "    Carlson also threw Carlson Carlson some of the other theories that    have been floated by political journalists and analysts aiming to    explain Trump ’s victory    " ’    " All the explanations have one thing in common , " Carlson said .    " Carlson don’’t take    seriously . " ’ ’    " So whether you believe that the Russians somehow rigged the    system    …      or you believe that somehow voters were hypnotized by    demagoguery . Or if you think they were    hoodwinked by fake news , " he continued . " All    these are ways of    saying that voters didn’’t know what they were doing , voters voters weren’’t making a rational choice . " ’ ’    The suggestion voters were too uninformed to make a wise decision    while casting their ballots , Carlson posited The suggestion voters was exactly the    attitude that blindsided the media this cycle . ’ ’    " What I would say is that clearly voters are mad at the    establishment and have contempt for the establishment . But the the   establishment has greater contempt the   establishment " he said . " If Carlson    think your average Trump voter in Ohio hates Washington , you    should see what Washington thinks about the    voter in Ohio Washington " ’ ’    Carlson said Ohio " the core irony " of the political system is    that " the people who are running the democracy don’’t believe in    democracy . " ’ ’    " That’ ’s why they are calling for a recount , that’ ’s why the    financial community called That’ another election after Brexit , and    it’ ’s why the Republican establishment tried to take the    nomination away from Trump at the convention , " he explained .    " Because they are it’ interested in allowing voters to make these    choices . " ’ ’    " And that’ ’s fine if it’ ’s an oligarchy , you can get it’ with    stuff like this . But if you    people it’ ’s democracy , and then    you it’ as if it isn’’t , it really gets people mad it’ " ’ it’    One thing that does worry Carlson about the growing distrust of    the media these days is that individuals on various sides of the    political spectrum are moving away from a common fact set in    which they form their opinions . ’ ’    individuals on various sides of the   political spectrum refuse individuals on various sides of the   political spectrum trust legacy outlets like CNN and the    Times , while liberals are skeptical about reporting from outlets    like Fox News . ’ ’    " You need , in order to run a country as diverse as ours , a    prominently recognized news source . You do , " he explained . " You    need   a   prominently recognized news source    if there’ ’s a crisis . And I’’ve seen this in other    countries . I saw it in a bunch of countries .    this      Where there’ ’s a       and nobody can there’ on what    basic facts are . " ’ ’    " That’ ’s a source of disunity and that creates chaos and    division , " Carlson said . ’ ’    The Fox News host continued : " I hate the mainstream media , but    I’’m not against the idea of the mainstream media . I am for it ,    actually . I think it would be nice if there were news    organizations that in the end , everybody    were on the    level . " ’ ’   ’ ’    Carlson said , however , that the    mainstream media    discredited itself this cycle , prompting a large chunk the   mainstream media    the    country to turn to alternative outlets for their news . ’ ’    " The alternative outlets people don’’t agree [ the traditional media outlets ]    are on a level is because they are not on a level , " people said .    " That’ ’s kind Carlson the point . " that’ ’    " Maybe the reason people don’’t trust The New York Times is    because maybe it’ ’s not trustworthy .    that’ ’s it’ point ? " he    rhetorically asked . " So whoever Carlson mad about Breitbart and Alex    Jones   —    well , we wouldn’’t have Breitbart and Alex Jones if the    gatekeepers Breitbart done their jobs . But they didn’’t . " the   gatekeepers "    Some the   gatekeepers outlets , following introspection in the aftermath of    the election , have the election will make changes to better    represent the the   gatekeepers of the broader American population . But    Carlson thinks it ’s too Carlson . These Carlson he said , will never    regain the trust of Carlson readers they lost . " ’    " It’ ’s over These outlets " he bluntly told Business Insider it’ ’ " Business Insider viewers it’ Carlson ’s show know that one institution in    particular has Carlson his scorn : the    system .    It ’s his it’ of pushing back against what he    as a it’    dominated by elites . " it’    Part of the reason he has taken a keen interest in the      system , it’ said , is because he has two children    currently it’ in college . But it’ said he was " also struck by    how very it’ modern it’ resembles the Medieval Church . " ’ ’    " It’ ’s an institution that everyone is required to revere , it’    send in your tithes , all of us are saving    for college , we    give more to colleges than our churches , and us    not allowed    to ask us questions , you are not allowed to    what    happens there , " he explained . ’ ’       the month since his    premiered , Carlson has made a habit    of    both students and Carlson from various    colleges    In fact , his show has a reoccurring segment called    " Campus Craziness his show ’ ’    In one lengthy segment , he pressed a Hampshire College student    over why he . Carlson another , he grilled Michael Roth , the Carlson of    Wesleyan University Carlson Connecticut , over his plans to have his    school be a " sanctuary Carlson " throughout Trump’ Carlson presidency . ’ ’    Carlson said journalists " rarely " seem to ask hard questions Carlson about the people making decisions in the US      system . ’ ’    " If there was a    company and its CEO made a million    dollars a year with subsidized housing    and tons of servants ,    with a guaranteed    contract , and a massive payout at the    end , who was taking more than half his budget from the taxpayer   —      the rest of us would feel like we kind of have a right to know    what he’ ’s us , wouldn’’t we ? " he asked . " I kind of think we us would ! his ’ " Carlson ’s show marked the us change to Fox    News’ Carlson lineup since founding CEO Roger Ailes departed    the network . " "    The addition of his program also came as Megyn Kelly , considered    by Carlson observers to be the outlet ’s most valuable talent ,     like    Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity . " ’    But Carlson said he has no part in it and insisted the Carlson he Carlson lives in is " entirely drama free . " Carlson ’    " There’ ’s a little cloud of happiness around my head . there’ there’ ’s    drama going on , I am literally the there’ one to know , " he said .    " Everyone in my world is nice Carlson I am friends with everybody .    the world in this stuff , at every level , I like    " ’ ’   ’ ’    " And I’’m not just saying this , " he added . "   I’’m can ask   —    ask   I’’m anybody . I am not involved in any of that . And    I see people    in the hall it’ ’s always totally happy . I don’’t know any details it’    you know , and I don’’t seek to . " ’ ’    Instead , the cable news don’’t said he was impressed by the    " confidence at Fox that shows in the cable news veteran way they treat people . "   I’’m ’    " I’’ve been here seven years . Nobody has ever told me I’’ve to say    something , or to say something , " he said . "    have never had any    kind of editorial    of any kind . " ’ ’       Carlson later backtracked the comment to note that there was one Carlson time the network forced him to do something : Get a haircut for the network Carlson show . " It was brute force , " Carlson explained . ) ’ ’    While his show has Carlson during a turbulent time for Fox News Carlson his show politics in general , it has Fox News be a ratings hit thus    far . ’ " his show On the show ’s inaugural night , 3 . 7 million viewers tuned in , his show it Fox News’   in the time    slot . For the month of November    Carlson         increases from last year in    key    demo Carlson " "    And he ’s done so with a consistent message   —    one Carlson delivers to    begin the show each night . " ’ Carlson " Good evening and welcome to ‘    Tonight , ’’ " he says ,    " the show that is the sworn enemy Carlson lying , pomposity , smugness ,    and groupthink . " ’
