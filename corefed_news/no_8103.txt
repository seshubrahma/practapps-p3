Friday on Fox News Channel ’s " Your World , " Republican strategist Karl Rove got into a heated back and forth with guest host Charles Payne over Rove ’s comments that a " fresh face " coming from a contested convention could help the GOP beat Hillary Clinton in the general election .   The interview became combative when guest host Charles Payne attempted to blame Rove for the last two Republican presidential losses . Rove said that was " baloney " and that the Republicans won the elections in which Rove was directly involved , saying , " You know what ? I was n’t the campaign manager . I was n’t in charge . I was a loyal soldier . I wanted both John McCain and Mitt Romney to win , but thank you for blaming me for John McCain and Mitt Romney defeat . But that ’s a bunch of baloney and we know it    …      I ’m willing to take responsibility if I ’m in charge but I was n’t in charge of the last two presidential campaigns . " In discussing why he felt Trump should not be the nominee , Rove said , " I want the Republican Party to win , and a man with a 30 percent favorable and 63 percent unfavorable and whose numbers are getting worse   —    whose numbers have deteriorating significantly from February . And every time I hope that he will turn around and show us that he can be presidential and do something to show us he can be capable of winning the general election , he offends more people and says more stupid stuff .
