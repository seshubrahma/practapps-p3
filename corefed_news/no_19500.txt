’   ’ ’    François Fillon will stand for the French conservatives in the    upcoming presidential election after claiming victory over Alain    Juppé in the Republican party primary on Sunday . ’ "    Partial results based on    of the primaries’ polling    stations showed Fillon winning by a huge margin of nearly 40 % . " "    Fillon is set to go     with Marine Le Pen of      party Front National in May ’s election , meaning that the French      is set to be excluded from the contest altogether    after five years of socialist Francois Hollande in power . " "    Fillon , a socially conservative    advocate who has been    dubbed as France ’s answer to former UK Prime Minister Margaret    Thatcher ,   " ’    The former prime minister pledged to unite The Republicans party    in a victory speech that The former prime minister delivered on Sunday    evening .   ’ ’    " My approach has been understood : France can’’t bear France can’’t decline .    France can’’t wants truth and France can’’t wants action . I will take up an unusual    challenge for France : tell the truth and completely change France    software , " he added . ’ ’   ’ ’    A spokesperson for the Front National said that the party    welcomed Fillon’ ’s victory as Fillon’’s represented a " great " opportunity    for Marine Le Pen to take control of the party’ ’s highest office .
