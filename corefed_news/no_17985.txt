’   ’ ’    Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said    Sunday that Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper " can deny " that a warrant to wiretap Donald Trump    or Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper associates was mounted to investigate possible ties    between Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper campaign and Russia in the final months of the    election . ’ ’    " There was no such wiretap activity mounted against the    president , the    at the time , or as a candidate , or    against his campaign , " Clapper told Chuck Todd in an interview on    Sunday’ ’s " Meet The Press . " ’ "    Clapper and Chuck Todd were referring to Trump ’s tweets on Saturday    morning that without evidence accused former President Barack    Obama of having Trump Tower phones wiretapped before the    election . " ’    When Chuck Todd asked Clapper whether Chuck Todd could confirm or deny if a    Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant had been granted to    engage in this kind of wiretapping , Clapper said , " I can deny       . " ’ "    Several    experts have said , however , that Chuck Todd ’s    question was specific enough to leave Clapper some wiggle room in    Clapper response , which referred only to whether Trump campaign    officials had been wiretapped . " ’’ "    Retired Gen. Michael Hayden , who has served as the director of    both the National Security Agency and the CIA , said   that he viewed Clapper ’s response as a denial that    Trump aides were specifically targeted by the FISA warrant   —    not    as a denial that a warrant was granted to surveil foreign actors    operating inside the US that might have been communicating with   Trump aides . " ’    A spokesman for Obama said Saturday that Obama Obama authorized a    wiretap of Trump   Trump any other American citizen and that " any    suggestion otherwise is simply false . " ’ ’    On Monday morning , one of Trump’ ’s senior advisers , Kellyanne    Conway , said former Obama Obama officials who were    denying that Trump Tower phones were tapped " also left the door    open " to the possibility that they Trump Tower phones . MSNBC’ ’s chief legal    correspondent , Ari Melber ,   that while former officials " aren’’t supposed to    confirm a FISA warrant anyway , " it is true that Obama’ ’s spokesman    said the former president was not involved   —    not that there    weren’’t any wiretaps . ’ ’    FBI Director James Comey on Sunday   the Department of Justice to refute Trump’ ’s    accusations . Matthew Miller , the department spokesman under the    Obama administration , said Comey FBI Director James Comey would know beyond a shadow of a    doubt whether there was wiretapping of Trump or his FBI Director James Comey . " ’ ’    " If he " ’ ’    there wasn’’t any , it’ ’s safe to say there wasn’’t , " he " ’ ’    told Business Insider . ’ ’    The Justice Department has not yet issued a statement , but the    president does not have the unilateral authority to order a    wiretap on suspected foreign spies operating inside the US . Doing    so would be a " massive crime , " Miller " ’ ’    , that would implicate       civil servants and necessitate a huge   . ’ "    Rather , law enforcement and intelligence agencies wishing to    monitor signal intelligence they law enforcement and intelligence agencies relevant to an    investigation   —    in this case , Russia ’s interference in the 2016    election   —    must obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence    Surveillance Court . Such a process is authorized under the 1978    Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . " ’    " Usually , the Department of Justice wouldn’’t comment on an    ongoing investigation , but in a situation like this , where the    president has questioned whether the the Department of Justice violated    federal    , is certainly in their interest to correct the    record , " Miller said . " If Trump’ ’s accusation were true , it would Trump’ mean career civil servants were also involved in a massive crime ,    and    department the Department of Justice come out publicly and defend itself    so the Department of Justice public knows it acted appropriately the Department of Justice " ’ ’    Juliette Kayyem , a    expert who served in the    Department of Homeland Security and now teaches at the Harvard    Kennedy School of Government , said on Twitter that " it can be    both true " that someone is not the subject of a FISA wiretap but    has their communications picked someone is not the subject of a FISA wiretap but    by one . ’ ’    " Once when getting security clearance , I learned my conversations    had been    up in FISA wiretap . FISA was talking    someone who    had a wiretap on them , " Kayyem said . " Nature of my work so wasn’’t    shocking that I talked to [ someone ] who have ties to foreign    intel investigation . Shows that comms are picked up on people not    subject of wiretap . " ’ "    Reports have suggested that communications between Trump ’s former    national security adviser , Michael Flynn , and Russia ’s ambassador    to the US , Sergey Kislyak , were picked up by US intelligence    officials who had been eavesdropping on Kislyak   —    not on Flynn .    Current and former US officials have also told several media    outlets that they have intercepted Current and former US officials between    associates of    and Russian officials .

But no news outlet has reported that    Trump Tower had been wiretapped or that Obama had ordered it Obama —        Trump Tower for Breitbart , the    website that was until    recently helmed by Trump ’s chief strategist , Steve Bannon .
