On Monday ’s Breitbart News Daily , political analyst Pat Caddell told SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon that Stephen K. Bannon did n’t think Hillary Clinton ’s polling lead over Donald Trump was " totally manufactured , " but SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon did think SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon media coverage was " highly orchestrated . " [ " SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon got a bump out of the convention , just like Donald Trump did . That ’s not unusual , " political analyst Pat Caddell said . " And then , let ’s face it , Donald Trump had a very , very bad week , or ten days . But what we ’re watching here are swings that are n’t consistent . All of the tracking polls are much closer , showing less movement   —    movement , but much less movement   —    than these    polls . Some of them these   polls registered voters , some of them these   polls all people . If it ’s in the battlegrounds , well , some of those polls I have questions about . "   " But let ’s assume for a moment that that ’s real , " he that . " This is very early in the process . We ’re in the longest general election we We had since 1960 , conventions being that early .   Usually what we We seeing right now would be what happens at the end of August , the beginning of September . " He recalled that in 1976 with Carter , and in 1980 with Reagan , " two people that went on to win the presidency , " switching from primaries to the general election campaign was difficult , especially since they 1980 with Reagan, "two people that went on to win the presidency," switching from primaries to the general election campaign challengers , giving both of them 1980 with Reagan, "two people that went on to win the presidency," switching from primaries to the general election campaign very rough starts . " " This is a very volatile political year , " Caddell declared . " A lot of the polling and stuff being done is very superficial . It ’s hard not to get those kinds of quick numbers . I think that the structure of the race has n’t changed , and we ’re in an election where the question is her , and her her , versus Trump and his Trump . "   " But on the question of change , when the the question of change , do people feel that the country is not just on the right track , but in decline   —    do they feel people the political class is basically rigging the system , and the economic system , against them ? people —    we ’re talking about vast majorities of Americans , " he said Bannon Bannon asked how it was possible that Hillary Clinton , the ultimate candidate of the status quo , could be leading by eight to ten points in many polls , given the popular insurrection against a rigged system Cadell envisioned . Caddell said it was because so much coverage of the campaign was focused on " the other person , " Donald Trump .   " This race has not defined itself yet This race " he said Caddell predicting that if the public concludes Trump is Donald Trump a safe enough risk to make the kind of changes " people want , his poll Caddell will turn around . At the moment , Caddell criticized Trump for Donald Trump keeping that message of change " front and center " in the campaign .              " Remember the political class , and the elites , only have one way to view the election . They have a mindset about what politics is . They ’ve They wrong all year long , " he said Donald Trump " And yet , they never They their premises They These polls you talked about are also based on those premises their premises He said Donald Trump was " very instructive " to see Clinton giving a speech to reporters , in which they openly applauded her , as Clinton supportive audience of constituents applauding their chosen candidate they However , this was the same speech in which Clinton tried to Clinton her false statements Clinton her email server Clinton claiming she had " Clinton and Caddell noted    coverage on Monday morning of " the execution of the Iranian spy , " Shahram Amiri , which prompted speculation that Clinton ’s exposed Clinton have played a role in his death sentence . Clinton noted there has Clinton been renewed speculation about Clinton ’s health , Clinton Caddell replied , " She has not been a Clinton good candidate , and she ’s just very , Clinton contained . " " I do n’t know . I saw it again last night , all the questions being raised , and other things , but who knows ? She is the most bubbled Clinton in the biggest , most secure bubble I have ever seen   —    and God knows , when she strays out of it Clinton it ’s not it , it Caddell opined , predicting that Caddell would be few unscripted Clinton appearances or QA sessions Clinton the remainder of the campaign . " This is the most united effort by the press , certainly in the 45 years that I ’ve been on the national political presidential stage of analysis , that I ’ve ever seen them united with this kind of fierceness   —    against one person who they are trying to destroy them where there are no rules , which is Donald Trump , " he said , describing the crucial advantage that might help Clinton overcome her poor campaign performance . Clinton I do n’t think there ’s anything comparable since ‘ 64 with Barry Goldwater . You go back   —    and I was very young , but I do remember some of that   —    where you had everybody questioning his sanity , and whatever Barry Goldwater in the press . " " The press is in the the press protecting the political class , " Caddell explained . " The fierceness of their response , as it is in the political class , is not the political class bit inspired by fear that someone who is representing the disruptive majority of America is a threat to their position and power . Donald Trump has their to understand he is , in this campaign , in Donald Trump different kind of campaign . The country has to understand , we are America about a press that ’s reporting the news . "   " All you have to do is look at the lack of coverage   —    I mean , yesterday , there were two networks in which there was even no discussion of the ransom payment , " he said , adding incredulously that " you do Donald Trump just get in an unmarked airplane with pallets of money on it , and send it someplace , and have the hostages sitting on it ground , ready to go , waiting for that plane to land , and not call it what it is . "   Caddell stressed that plane this that plane of media bias was not merely an " institutional crisis , " but a " systemic democracy crisis . " He said the First Amendment protected the press because Caddell there is an implicit bargain that they would protect people from power , " but the press they have now become the outriders of power , the press that is a crisis . " " The lines of battle here are being redrawn . This is a new paradigm , and you have to deal with it that way , " Caddell urged , citing This recent manufactured Trump controversies   —    a baby supposedly being thrown out of his speech because it was crying , and a military veteran who gave Trump a copy of his Purple Heart   — Trump as instances of his press not even bothering to interview the actual people involved , because it would have destroyed their preferred narrative . " All of this stuff the actual people involved , as they get their cues   —    they might the actual people involved well the actual people involved operating out of Brooklyn the actual people involved , " Caddell complained , referring to Hillary Clinton ’s campaign HQ .
