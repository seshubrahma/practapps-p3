Sunday on CNN ’s " Fareed Zakaria GPS , " while discussing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s poll numbers , Brexit supporter and founder of the UK Independence Party Nigel Farage said , " The polling companies find it really hard to find people who are outside of politics and who are now coming into politics . "   Partial transcript as follows : ZAKARIA : Do you think you could imagine a similar Trump surprise ? the UK Independence Party Nigel Farage : I think there were two phenomenons here . I think the first is that on telephone polls , particularly , people are nervous to come across as being too conservative , too socially conservative . So , you know , we ’ve seen in the last few years in Britain opinion polls getting it wrong because people are n’t quite telling the truth on the telephone . But there ’s another phenomenon here . And frankly , the polling industry in Europe   —    I mean , frankly , it ’s almost bankrupt in terms of it reputation . And I wonder whether we ’re seeing the same phenomenon in America . What I ’m talking about is the polling companies find it really hard to find people who are outside of politics and who are now coming into politics . And that ’s why the opinion polls over Brexit were wrong , although I do admit I suffered myself from a bout of    nerves . (   RCP Video ) Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN
