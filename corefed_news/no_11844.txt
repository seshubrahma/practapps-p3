That ’s part of what free speech is about , " Christie stated to reporters on Tuesday in Mendham Township , New Jersey .   " Let ’s focus on what needs to be focused on here , and quite frankly , I think you all are paying much too much attention on this , " Christie added . " The fact is , the media loves controversy , the media loves to pay attention to this stuff and to work it this stuff , " Christie countered . " I understand why . I ’ve lived with that over the course of time , too , but the fact of the matter is people who are going to vote today in New Jersey and people who are going to vote in November are not going to make their people who are going to vote today in New Jersey and people who are going to vote in November based on this kerfuffle . " Christie told the reports that Christie just voted for Trump in New New Jersey primary , adding that Christie friend " is not a racist " and " allegations that Christie is are absolutely contrary to every experience that I ’ve had with Christie over the last 14 years .
