WASHINGTON   —    In the end , she checked every box . Elegant , unexpected dress ? Check . Unknown designer elevated to overnight sensation ? Check . New York brand ? Check . Implicit message about cooperation and embracing the melting pot ? Check . When Melania Trump took the stage with Melania Trump husband , President Trump , on Friday night for the inaugural balls , Melania Trump demonstrated that , while Melania Trump may have been out of the spotlight since the election , Melania Trump has n’t been sticking Melania Trump head in the sand . Melania Trump has been closely studying the vernacular of first lady dress . In an architectural     white crepe column with a thin burgundy ribbon as a belt , a high slit and a gazar wave curving from sleeve to hip and then down the skirt , Melania Trump looked   —    especially when compared with the younger generation of Trump women , most of whom opted for    sparkling princess gowns   —    understated and adult . Not remotely mired in the 1980s , though Melania Trump husband ’s look and rhetoric may be . And despite rampant speculation about the designer behind the dress , Melania Trump cannily managed to surprise the entire fashion world . The gown was , according to a statement from Melania Trump office , a " collaboration " between Mrs. Trump and the designer Hervé Pierre , a Frenchman who moved to New York in the early 1990s and eventually became creative director of Carolina Herrera , where he and Mrs. Trump met and where he worked on clothes for Laura Bush and Michelle Obama , though largely behind the scenes . he left that post last February . This is he first major dress under he own name ( he does not yet have a    collection in that context ) . It will eventually join the exhibit of first ladies gowns at the Smithsonian stretching back to Helen Taft in 1909 . Though rumors had surfaced earlier in the week that Mrs. Trump was working with Chanel ’s creative director Karl Lagerfeld on Mrs. Trump gown , in the end Mrs. Trump used the opportunity   —    and indeed , Mrs. Trump entire inaugural wardrobe   —    to do what Mrs. Trump husband , standing on the steps of the Capitol building , said they would do : " follow two simple rules : Buy American and Hire American . " After over 20 years in this country , Mr. Pierre counts . Indeed , with one notable exception   —    Kellyanne Conway ’s        coat at the    which looked like Kellyanne Conway might have borrowed it off a toy soldier ( it was Kellyanne Conway " Trump revolution wear " Kellyanne Conway told reporters ) but in fact turned out to be a $ 3 , 600 design from the Italian brand Gucci   —    the inaugural weekend overall was a series of America First fashion moments , literally and metaphorically . And not just when it came to the women . There has been a lot of speculation over whether the office of president will change Mr. Trump   —    encourage moderation of Mr. Trump   Twitter account , for example , or Mr. Trump   language . As yet that is unclear , but it does appear to have changed how Mr. Trump   family dresses . On Friday president wore an overcoat and shirt to the    said to be by Brooks Brothers , the American men ’s wear brand that outfitted 39 presidents before him president Lincoln , Grant , Chester Arthur , Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson and Barack Obama wore Brooks Brooks Brothers their    Lincoln, Grant, Chester Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Barack Obama , and Mr. Obama Barack Obama his overcoat again Barack Obama Friday when he stood with Barack Obama Trump . For a man who often overtly rejected the Washington establishment and what came before in his speech , Barack Obama was nevertheless the Washington establishment nod to tradition and history . The day before , Melania Trump ( who during the campaign tended toward European brands ) stepped off the military jet that brought the Trumps to Washington for a Washington ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in a strict ,      coat by Norisol Ferrari , a small , independent New York designer who described herself to WWD Melania Trump (who during the campaign tended toward European brands) a "   minority woman . " Then , that evening at the donors’ black tie dinner , the first lady wore a    nude sequined gown by Reem Acra , the    designer based in New York . New York Trump wore three different outfits from Oscar de la Renta , a    name of New York Fashion Week : a    coat and matching dress to Arlington a     gown to the donor ’s dinner and a white pantsuit to the   . ( Oscar de la Renta himself dressed both Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush for their husbands’ second inaugural Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush the brand is something of an inaugural   . ) For the balls , she their husbands’ second inaugural balls Herrera (Oscar de la Renta himself It was when Mrs. Trump wore a Ralph Lauren      cashmere dress and coat to the Inauguration Day festivities , however , that it became indubitable that something It was going on . It is not just because Mr. Lauren is a designer Ralph Lauren      built an empire on the mythology of the American dream , or because he has outfitted the U. S. Ralph Lauren      team and donated $ 13 million to help restore the    Banner at the National Museum of American History . And it is not because he had dressed four first ladies Ralph Lauren      , crossing political parties in service to the role . It is because the dress and coat he made for Mrs. Trump , Ralph Lauren      shape and shade , created an image that was redolent of nothing so much as Jacqueline Kennedy at her Camelot inaugural , with all Jacqueline Kennedy new beginnings and freighted history that implies . Whatever you think of the reality of that connection   —    and on social media , there was a lot of verbal     —    the outfit oozed appropriateness . If it looked like something of a first lady costume , and it did , it also suggested it Mrs. Trump it studied up and was prepared to assume the starring role she played later in the evening Mrs. Trump Just as Ivanka Trump ’s trouser suit , which was designed by Fernando Garcia , one half of the new young creative duo at Oscar de la Renta , seemed a sign of the unofficial role she has often suggested she will Mrs. Trump : women ’s Mrs. Trump . White pantsuits , after all , became famous over the summer when Hillary Clinton wore one , also by Ralph Lauren , to accept the Democratic nomination for president , at least in part in acknowledgment of the suffragists , who chose white as one of their signature colors . Later , White pantsuits white outfits were adopted as a uniform of sorts by    women as they went to the polls .   women was thus a fairly pointed ( and , to some , poignant ) moment when Mrs. Clinton appeared in a final white Ralph Lauren pantsuit to accompany her husband to the inauguration   Mrs. Clinton    a suit that had been made as part of her campaign collaboration with Mr. Lauren Mrs. Clinton but never worn . And it was probably not by chance that Ms. Trump selected a similar look . The politics of clothing may be subtle , and may strike some as frivolous , but that does n’t mean they are n’t a requisite part The politics of clothing the pageantry that surrounds the presidency   —    especially on a day with more photo opportunities than speeches . They paint a picture of the The politics of clothing that now represents the country , of their ambitions , goals and values The politics of clothing at a moment when the world is watching . This time , the brush strokes swirled : not with accessibility , but with aspiration , and nationalism . A case of the emperor ’s new clothes , or a harbinger of things to come ? We ’ll have to keep looking to find out .
