In a previously    video from February at the Clinton Global Initiative , former President Bill Clinton suggested that the U. S. use Syrian refugees to rebuild Detroit . [ " The truth is that the big loser in this over the long run is going to be Syria . This is an enormous opportunity for Americans , " former President Bill Clinton said about the Syrian migrant crisis .   Detroit Detroit 10 , 000 empty , structurally sound houses —   10 , 000 . And lot of jobs to be had repairing those 10, 000 empty, structurally sound houses Detroit Detroit came out of bankruptcy and the mayor ’s trying to do an innovative sort of urban homesteading program there . But it just gives you an example of what could be done . And I think any of us who have ever had any personal experience with either Syrian Americans or Syrian refugees think it ’s a pretty good deal . It is it from the video why Clinton seems to think it would be better to fill these Detroit jobs with imported foreign migrants rather than unemployed Americans already living there , who could perhaps benefit from    jobs . In the video , Clinton discusses Clinton migrant crisis with billionaire and mass migration enthusiast Hamdi Ulukaya of the Chobani yogurt empire . Ulukaya has become a figure of controversy for his decision Ulukaya fill his yogurt Ulukaya with foreign refugees rather than unemployed Americans . At the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year , Ulukaya encouraged Ulukaya global elites to follow his lead Ulukaya The unearthed video seems to underscore Donald Trump ’s recent declaration that , " Hillary Clinton would rather provide a job to a refugee from overseas than to give that job a job    youth in cities like Detroit who have become refugees in their own country . " Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton for a 550 percent expansion to the importation of Syrian refugees . Based on the minimum figures she has put Hillary Clinton thus far , a President Hillary Hillary Clinton a population of refugees ( 620 , 000 ) that nearly equals the population of Detroit ( 677 , 116 ) . Detroit has previously explained that , " for the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend Hillary Clinton , we could rebuild every inner city in America . " According to a September 2015 Rasmussen survey , 85 percent black voters oppose Clinton ’s refugee agenda to admit more Hillary Clinton 100 , 000 Middle Eastern refugees —   with less than one percent of black voters ( . 56 percent ) in favor of her refugee plan . Yet during the Clinton Global Initiative discussion , Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton to suggest that the Hillary Clinton ought to accept more Syrian refugees —   on top of the tens of thousands of refugees the U. S. already admits annually from other nations the U. S. . In particular , Clinton praised Turkey for having taken in 2 Hillary Clinton Syrian refugees . " Turkey , as you probably know , has by far the Turkey number of Syrian refugees —   there are more than 2 million there , " Clinton said . " The Turks have done Hillary Clinton really admirable job of taking in all these refugees , " Clinton said later in his remarks . " Hillary Clinton the last two Hillary Clinton , 24 percent of all the new businesses started in Turkey were started by Syrian refugees . I mean , these Turkey are incredibly gifted and very hard working , " Clinton added . Clinton did not mention the Hillary Clinton that , Hillary Clinton the United States , 91 . 4 percent of recent refugees from the Middle East are on food stamps , and 68 . 3 percent are on cash welfare , according to data from the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services . During the discussion , Ulukaya seemed enthusiastic about the potential transformation of entire communities that could result from    immigration . " There ’s a town actually in the eastern part of Turkey , it ’s called Kilis , [ where ] sixty percent of a town whole town is refugees . I mean , this all a town last three , four years , " Ulukaya said , noting earlier in his remarks that , " Ulukaya ’m proud of what the Ulukaya of Turkey and what people in the government are trying to do on this Turkey . It ’s huge . " Clinton suggested that it ’s " important " this issue focus on the entrepreneurship of Syrian migrants this issue than address the public ’s opposition to the importation of large numbers of refugees from    regions of the world . I know what caused all the fear and reluctance . It was Paris . Because 6 , 000 people went from Europe to    [ and ] about 1 , 500 came home . If one percent of them was radicalized then sort of sneaked back in with evil intentions , 6, 000 people ’s about how many people it took to kill all of those people in Paris . So people are thinking like that , but the tradition of Paris Syrians is amazing   …      Clinton apparently did not feel it necessary to in any way answer these concerns , other than to simply insists that Syrians are " amazing " . Nor did Clinton address the fact that   —    as the Chairman of the Clinton Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee has explained   —    there is " no real way of vetting , to any extent , these refugees coming in . " To bolster his argument about the entrepreneurial spirit of Middle Eastern refugees , Clinton cited some personal anecdotes . For instance , Clinton noted that he Clinton a friend working with the IRC who filmed Clinton asked " Clinton thousand " Syrians arriving in Turkey " literally coming off the boat   …      ‘ What were you doing before you left your home?’ And they were overwhelmingly small business people , workers , and not a small number of professionals , " Clinton said . Clinton later added : " In America   …      Clinton largest Syrian Clinton are in Cleveland , [ Ohio ] and Dearborn , Michigan . And if you went up there and said something bad about them , you could get in a fight —   not with a Syrian —   but with someone who ’s Irish or African American or Hispanic or Polish because they are such a part of the community . They have made such someone who’s Irish or African American or Hispanic or Polish contributions . " Clinton did not address any someone who’s Irish or African American or Hispanic or Polish the cultural or national security challenges that have accompanied    migration from predominantly Muslim third world nations into these American communities in Michigan and Ohio . When Clinton asked Ulukaya how many refugees should be brought into the U. S. Clinton did not answer specifically , but pointed to the Ulukaya done in accepting large flows of refugees . Trump has previously warned that " Hillary Clinton wants to be America ’s Angela Merkel " . Ulukaya said Clinton listened to Madeleine Albright the other day   …      She said , Ulukaya know , we ’re not doing enough . And I was in Germany Ulukaya after . Looking at Hamburg , Hamburg took almost 90 , 000 refugees . And Germany was with the mayor and for two Hamburg we looked at the refugee centers [ and ] what they did . They were prepared to we    you know , that ’s what they were the refugee centers for years the refugee centers Now they took 90 , 000 . Neither Bill Clinton nor the refugee centers mentioned the fact that the U. the refugee centers already takes in 70 , 000 refugees annually   —    on top of the additional thousands of Syrian refugees President Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan pushed to resettle in the country this year alone . During the discussion , Ulukaya boasted about how he has " 11 different nationalities [ represented ] in Chobani factories " Ulukaya how he had Ulukaya hire " 11 different translators into the factory " because the local company employees Ulukaya n’t communicate with one another . " Every summer , we do our Chobani picnic and , you should see , it ’s [ like the ] United Nations we there , " Ulukaya proudly declared about his our Chobani picnic S.   company . Ulukaya explained that Syrian refugees " bring Ulukaya to the community Ulukaya like in   …      Ulukaya Falls , [ Idaho ] " where Ulukaya ’s yogurt factory is based . As Leo Hohmann has previously reported , " the state Ulukaya Idaho , despite its reputation as a mostly white , conservative farm state , has been a popular destination for "the state of Idaho in recent years " —    in large part due to Ulukaya ’s efforts to import refugees to work in his yogurt factory . " Ulukaya opened the Ulukaya largest yogurt factory in Twin Falls about two Leo Hohmann ago , and the Ulukaya now employs 600 people with about 30 percent of those jobs filled by foreign refugees shipped to the U. S. from United Nations camps in the Middle East and Africa , " Hohmann writes . Twin Falls is in line to receive about 300 refugees this year , many of them Muslims from Twin Falls …      The U. S. State Department has shipped more than 11 , 000 300 refugees directly from the Third World to Idaho since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . Just in the past year , 989 refugees have arrived in the rural state , most of them landing in either Boise or Twin Falls . Nearly half have come Idaho the world ’s nastiest jihadist 989 refugees zones , including Twin Falls Iraq , 94 from Somalia , 47 from Sudan , 39 from Afghanistan , 31 from Iran , 28 from Syria and 11 from Pakistan , according to the federal refugee database . In recent months , the mass importation Syria refugees has become a topic of controversy in Idaho —    as American communities have struggled with some unique assimilation challenges posed by    migration from the Third World . Idaho June , Iraqi and Sudanese refugees allegedly sexually assaulted a five    American girl in the Third World Idaho . According to allegations , one refugee attempted to anally and orally penetrate the     in Twin Falls urinating on her , while another Idaho watched and filmed the assault . In an interview with Breitbart News , the father of the American girl said the American girl had watched thirty seconds of the tape : Thirty seconds showed them in the laundry room , they pulled my daughter around , pushed the father of the American girl up against the wall , pulled her pants off , he one refugee his pants , he was one refugee to get her from behind   my daughter      after that   …      my daughter he ] tried the father of the American girl the her pants … the father of the American girl oral [ sex ] my daughter her , he shoved it in her mouth   …     the father of the American girl peed all over her in her mouth , all over her body , my daughter face the father of the American girl head   oral [sex] with her my daughter [ he ] defiled the father of the American girl . Then in my daughter , my daughter her mouth   , Mohammed my daughter Elda , my daughter trapped and sexually assaulted a 33    mentally disabled woman my daughter Twin Falls , Idaho . In order to deal with some of the challenges to assimilation , the Office for Idaho Twin Falls a brochure to Twin Falls, Idaho are looking to hire refugees and need assistance in dealing with the cultural differences of new arrivals from the third world . The brochure recommends , in some cases , avoiding eye contact with migrant employees , which for Burmese migrants can the Third World an act of challenge " . The brochure also recommends a brochure to help American employers who are looking to hire refugees and need assistance in dealing with the cultural differences of new arrivals from the third world about employee ’s female family members , which to Afghan migrants can be seen as " an act requiring revenge " . Clinton concluded the CGI discussion by a brochure to help American employers who are looking to hire refugees and need assistance in dealing with the cultural differences of new arrivals from the third world for his work the Clinton Global Initiative discussion and urged Clinton CEOs present at the Clinton Global Initiative to Clinton Ulukaya Ulukaya example . " We need more companies like Twin Falls " Clinton said .
