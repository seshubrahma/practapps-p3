After two brutal campaigns against Sanders and Trump , Trump now Clinton to explain the failure to friends in a seemingly endless round of phone calls . That was taking a toll on her already Clinton and    soul . But mostly , she was Clinton —    mad that she ’d Clinton and that the country would have to endure a Trump presidency Trump The authors detail how Clinton went out of her way Clinton pass blame for her stunning Clinton on " Comey and Russia . " " She wants Clinton make sure all these narratives get spun the right way , " a longtime Clinton confidant Clinton quoted as saying .

For a couple of hours , with Shake Shack containers littering the room , they went Shake Shack containers the script they would Shake Shack containers to the press and the public . Already , Russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument . The Clinton camp settled on a    plan   —    pushing the press to cover how " Russian hacking Russian the major unreported story of the campaign , overshadowed by the contents of stolen    and Hillary ’s own    imbroglio    " while " hammering the media for focusing so intently on the investigation into her    Hillary had created a cloud over her candidacy Hillary " the authors wrote .

" On this all long list of people , agencies , and international forces Hillary blamed for her loss , Obama had Hillary spot . Elsewhere , however , Allen and Parnes provide polling numbers and other raw data that pinpoint the precise reason why Clinton lost   —    hint : it ’s not Russia   —    men and working class Democrats in Pennsylvania turning to Trump , and how he simply outperformed her with Trump voters in Trump Florida : Exit polls in Pennsylvania showed that Clinton and Pennsylvania won women Clinton    margins in 2016 and 2012 , respectively . But in a state that has never elected a woman governor or US senator , men favored Trump by seventeen points —    a massive increase over Mitt Romney ’s    edge in 2012 . From a geographical perspective , Hillary did better than Obama in Philadelphia and its surrounding suburban counties but Philadelphia    Democratic strongholds in Erie and Luzerne Counties that Obama had carried . In Obama , Trump crushed Hillary in the suburban swing Hillary outside Tampa and St. Petersburg . As he did nationally , Trump Trump better with white Trump than Romney had , doubling up Clinton at 64 percent to 32 percent . Romney had beaten Obama 61 Romney to 37 Obama among Florida whites .

Trump won 52 percent to 41 percent in Brown County , home of Green Bay , site of the visit that Hillary and Obama canceled after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando . Obama had won the county by Obama points in Brown County lost it by two points in 2012 . Obama , who had been blown out by Bernie Sanders in the Wisconsin primary , never set foot in the state . Lastly , Shattered examines how Trump turned Michigan   —    a state that had been blue since 1992   —    into a red state : About a dozen counties in Michigan flipped from Obama to Trump , Michigan   one mattered most . Trump County , flush with    and    whites , gave Trump more than his statewide margin of Trump .
