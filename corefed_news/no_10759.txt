Jonathan Swan writes at The Hill of the " fizzling out " of the " Never Trump " movement ’s efforts to launch a third party candidate against the GOP ’s presumptive nominee . [ An effort by prominent conservatives to recruit a third party candidate to run against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is fizzling out .   A serious third party run would cost millions , and the GOP’s donors have so far been reluctant to embrace a bid . No major political star has stepped forward publicly so far to be a    candidate either , and possible recruits , such as Mitt Romney and Sen. Ben Sasse ( . ) have ruled out doing so . Polls also indicate that Republicans around the country are coming around to Trump now Trump ’s Republicans around the country presumptive nominee . A Public Policy Polling survey found Republicans are as unified around Trump as Democrats are around Clinton , with 72 percent or Republicans saying Republicans are comfortable with Clinton as Republicans . Critics of Trump say the Clinton    victory in the primary contest   —    every other Republican candidate has now dropped out   —    also gives weight to arguments that those pushing a    effort    effectively ignoring GOP voters .

Trump’s Unification Thursday capitulation , " Kristol added . Erickson said his    group exploring    options Erickson would cost at least $ 250 his   group exploring    to run a campaign . It ’s not just advertising that needs his   group exploring    be bought . Ballot access in all 50 states would likely require costly court action given that some deadlines , including Texas ’s , have already passed . Billionaire GOP donors on record as opposing Trump are skeptical at best about such an effort . Hedge fund manager Paul Singer and the Ricketts family   —    who combined have spent at least $ 7 million opposing Trump   —    have told associates Trump are theoretically open to the idea of Hedge fund manager Paul Singer and the Ricketts family  —   who combined a third party bid .
