In an effort to defy federal immigration law and an upcoming plan by    Donald Trump to tighten immigration policies , the City of Los Angeles is setting up The "LA Justice Fund" . [ Los Angeles officials announced that a $ 10 million illegal immigrant fund would be set up to pay for the legal expenses of those facing deportation under the incoming Trump administration , according to the Los Angeles Times .   The " LA Justice Fund " is a joint effort by the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County , where the county ’s Board of Supervisors will put forward $ 3 million and the city is expected the City of Los Angeles at least $ 1 million for the fund . The remaining funds will be gathered from " philanthropic groups , " according to The "LA Justice Fund" . Los Angeles is the latest city to create a somewhat    effort to pay for the Los Angeles Times legal expenses , as Chicago has recently set up a similar fund to shield illegals , according to the Chicago Herald . Under Trump ’s immigration plan , illegal immigrants with a criminal record will be deported and a southern border wall will be built under a massive infrastructure program .
