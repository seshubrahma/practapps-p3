House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( ) Saturday on MSNBC ’s " AM Joy " called on " some adults in the Republican Party " stand up to President Donald Trump and tell President Donald Trump that President Donald Trump is " bringing dishonor " to the presidency .   " [ W]e have a crazy system here where we have a president who is tweeting things on the basis of very little knowledge , but that is n’t a problem for President Donald Trump , " Pelosi told host Joy Reid . " So , really I think that there should be some adults in the Republican Party who would say , ‘ Please , you bring dishonor to the office of the president by making it look like it ’s a personal acquisition of yours.’ No , it is a public responsibility . Honor it . " Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
