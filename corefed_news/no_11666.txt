Ann Coulter , author of the new book In Trump We Trust : E Pluribus Awesome ! joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday ’s Breitbart News Daily to talk about the 2016 election , the effect Trump campaign has had on the Republican Party , and the folly of conservatives who think Hillary Clinton represents the better of two bad choices . [ Coulter agreed with Marlow ’s Alex Marlow Trump ’s Trump revealed the outlines of a " uniparty " in Washington , D. C. more interested in protecting its own interests than Coulter voters in the heartland .   " Trump has flushed Trump all the cheap labor fanatics , all the defenders of the globalists , the ones who are in it for their Trump salaries and not for the country , " she said . Trump As I say in my book , their slogan is , their I only regret that I have but one country to give for my TV gig.’ That ’s not who we are . We ’re not in this for the territorial Republican Party , or for out polling firm , or consulting firm . It ’s about preserving this United States of America . "   Listen to Coulter on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM : " And the fact that Trump is out there alone   —    well , it ’s him and this people Trump " Coulter said . " Coulter know sometimes , some people think that perhaps it ’s not ‘ presidential,’ some of the Tweets he sends , but look at how he is running his he campaign . he is with these incessant 10 , 20 ,     rallies . It ’s between him It and the he , and his Twitter feed . he have this direct , unfiltered vision into the man I hope will be President . " " It is a rebellion of the people against all of Washington , " she declared , noting ruefully that even conservatives in Washington she used to Washington she rallied to defend that "   town " from Trump ’s populist onslaught . " It is not about the country , it Washington their jobs It think tanks , and lobbying firms , and ‘ what can we do for you , Chamber of Commerce ? ’ " Coulter said contemptuously . Marlow pointed to an exclusive excerpt from Coulter ’s book , published Coulter Breitbart News on Monday , in which she proclaimed the beginning of Marlow " Trump era . " Responding to the popularity of the Breitbart News post , Coulter declared , " You Coulter the best readers in the business ! " In that book excerpt , Coulter made it clear that Coulter support for Trump is Coulter more on the issues than his outspoken and defiant personal Coulter . She told Marlow that one Coulter her goals in writing In Coulter We Trust was to Trump supporters of the Republican candidate " some ammunition and to explain things they ’ve been lied to some ammunition by the media , " including Trump ’s stand on the Trump . " It is an attack on the media , and an the media my old party , not the new Trumpian Republican Party , " she said of her book . " But some she it was written with the NeverTrumpers her book mind . I ’m pleased to say I do n’t know many of them   —    and , some of it a sidebar here , I know there ’s this big thing about how the only people who support Trump are uneducated white men . I love uneducated white men . I ’m with Trump   —    I love Trump . They ’re probably better off not having uneducated white men a    class . " Having said that , she noted that her acquaintances are " mostly in New she and L. A. lawyers , doctors , investment bankers , a lot of Hollywood producers , and comedy writers , " and they were " all fanatical Trump supporters her acquaintances are "mostly in New York and L. A. lawyers, doctors, investment bankers, a lot of Hollywood producers, and comedy writers but one " in New York , with a strong    New York Los Angeles as well . She is nevertheless well aware of the NeverTrump contingent among conservative intellectuals and said part of her book was pitched at them because she She n’t " understand what the NeverTrump contingent among conservative intellectuals ’re She angry about . "   the NeverTrump contingent among conservative intellectuals What is this visceral dislike for him ? " Coulter asked . " Until that Mexican rapist She that won my heart forever , I probably would have thought of Trump about the same way some of the NeverTrumpers do   —    which is to say , I never really thought about him that much . I do n’t think Trump was as bitchy as they are , but I would have thought , oh , come on , give me a break , you ca n’t be serious . It ’s his issues that won us over . No Trump is looking at Trump and saying , ‘ Well , I Trump n’t really care about the issues , I just want a man his issues that won us over in the White House.’ No , it ’s not that . We are the ones who are being substantive and looking at the issues . "   " They ’re the ones who are being superficial snobs the ones who are being substantive and looking at the issues including one of my former favorites , Charles Murray , " she contended . " He ca n’t get past the superficial stuff Trump —    the trophy wives , and oh , Trump misstated something about the funding imperatives of Common Core . Look , Charles Murray has spent all these years writing crucially Charles Murray about the forgotten working class in America . We finally have a presidential candidate who ’s going to come along and do something about it , something I thought my party was in favor of : helping the American people , the working class , the middle class . "   " And what do the intellectuals say ? What do the consultants , and the lobbyists , and the Chamber of Commerce say ? ‘ No , I ’m sorry , we ca n’t help the working class,’ " Coulter said We . Marlow noted that the Washington political establishment considers it offensive to address those    voters with sympathy and the Washington political establishment their issues . " They just want to please the Business Roundtable because their their in politics is purely mercantile : how can their make money off of this ? " Coulter agreed their " In one way , I sort of feel sorry for the    plutocrats who have been ripped off by these grifters , all this time   —    ‘ No , no , no , trust me , we just need money , we ’re going to make Jeb president.’ And they manage we get credulous billionaires to give them millions their dollars . Jeb had , what , their 140 million and ends Jeb president.’ with four delegates ? Trump spent a few million dollars and got more votes than any Republican in the history of the Republican primaries . " " It shows that Americans are smarter and more intellectual than either party thought . More than the party apparatuses themselves are , " she said . Marlow posited that the party apparatuses does n’t get Marlow credit for his leadership skills Trump having shaped the conversation on issues Trump from immigration to national security despite the media establishment ’s portrayal of him as universally unpopular beyond his dedicated base . " Trump Trump in the race Trump we have some idea of what the debates would have looked like , what the election would have looked like , " Coulter agreed , noting that a chapter of her book is devoted to exploring that very subject . Coulter I go through the questions he was asked in his very first interview on Bill Coulter on Fox News Coulter Guess , close your eyes , guess , guess , guess . Was it about immigration ? Was it about trade , about endless wars in the Middle East ? ISIS , what will you do about ISIS ? And the rest of the interview was about ISIS , Syria , Ukraine . his very first interview on Bill O’Reilly on Fox News of immigration , no mention of trade deals . " " We know what the media would have done . It would be all global warming , talking snowmen , and    bathrooms . Republicans would take turns seeing who could denounce abortion with the most vigor , " she envisioned . " No , Trump looks around the country , sees what the problems are , talks about Ukraine   —    and suddenly that ’s all anybody ’s talking about . They may not talk about it in any detail when they ’re anybody Trump . It tends to never get much further anybody , ‘ Trump ’s a buffoon!’ But man , did he turn the entire Trump discussion around , by talking about trade Trump immigration , and endless , pointless wars . " Marlow praised Coulter ’s ability to reach younger people with her work and asked her advice on fighting the " infection " Marlow political correctness running Marlow through the millennial generation . She said one reason she does so well with younger audiences is Marlow she ’s been Marlow banned from television , " so she has Marlow working extensively in online media   —    a Marlow venue for reaching young people . " The interesting thing is , no one under fifty watches TV , " Coulter laughed . " So my big interviews are on the Internet , are on Vice . I have a big review and an interview on Vice coming up again for this book . " She said her Vice with younger her book been " great , " Marlow them Marlow " bright and rebellious enough to even end up talking to younger audiences or becoming my friends . " However , she said that in Marlow " broader view , it does seem like Marlow ’s a little bit of a problem , and it does come from 13 years of    brainwashing through the public schools , through the colleges . " " I just find it hard to believe that any sentient being could go through this   —    I mean , the crazy P. C. culture of colleges . Whoa , have the Left swept our institutions ! Cultural Marxism has so completely triumphed at the universities , " she judged . " But like I say , I ca n’t see a sentient being , whether they speak out about it or not , not resenting it , and a sentient being making them angry . Which is why at least it of the it I a sentient being   —    including millennials who came from very    institutions , and I mean , you know , their voluntary places of work , that I wo n’t name for fear very   institutions outing some of them   —    total Trumpsters . " Marlow asked Coulter if she very   institutions ever Coulter in her Marlow , due to Marlow enormous amount of hatred Marlow her way . " Well , I think , like Marlow , I was n’t Trump with that gene that makes you worry about what other people think , " she replied . " It ’s a very useful way Marlow be . But you know , I care about the country more , and luckily , so do a lot of Americans Ukraine may be wrong from time to time   —    but I do n’t think so !   —    but I ’m always telling you what I believe . I ’m not telling you something because I think this is gon na get me ’m TV . " Coulter told Marlow there two Coulter factors driving the harshest Republican and Marlow critics of Trump : One is , Trump ‘ Uniparty,’ as you call it   —    I do sort of hate the Marlow ‘ Washington establishment’ because it ’s Washington so misused in the past , but Marlow ’s hard to come up with a better phrase Marlow —    the Republican Brain Trust , the Washington Establishment , the Insiders , and the people to whom I ’m referring are 100 % of the lobbyists , the consultants , the think tanks , the pollsters   …      this is existential for them . If they ca n’t shake down billionaires , to run loser candidates the pollsters   Marco Rubio the pollsters   Jeb Bush , and feed them all their little talking points , ‘ Here , we ’ll tell you loser candidates like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush it the pollsters   done’   —    these poor billionaires , they ’ve been fooled all this time by the consultants . They thought they these poor billionaires be good , because they were expensive . That ’s these poor billionaires many these poor billionaires value things : ‘ Oh these poor billionaires that cost a lot of money , he must be good at what he does . Well , wow , Trump sure showed they are Trump good he Trump they do . And the Trump thing is , there ’s always resentments toward the person who wupped your butt . For example , I remember this from 2012 , is each Republican dropped out as Romney   —    and I was a huge Romney supporter because he was the best on immigration we had had until the dawn of Trump Romney —    as each Republican dropped Trump Rick Perry , Herman Cain , Newt Gingrich , they would endorse anyone but Romney . They went out throwing bombs over their shoulders Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich Romney on the way Romney . Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich there ’s always bitterness toward Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich guy who Romney beat you . That , I understand .    But the bitterness , the sour grapes coming from Ted Cruz and John Kasich , it ’s being encouraged by a media culture that will reward them   —    that will suddenly discover how much respect the New York Times Ted Cruz and John Kasich for Mormons and for all the people who led us into the Iraq War . Suddenly they ’re respected foreign policy advisers . I mean , I write about this in all the people who led us into the Iraq War second book , Slander , actually in several of my books , all of the media rewards that are waiting for any Republican who turns on a fellow Republican . Well , any Republican who turns on Trump   —    I mean , it ’s Trump I do n’t really watch that much cable news anymore because it ’s unwatchable , it ’s nothing but slander . I mean , if they give it a good argument it the other side , I like to    TV , but it ’s just    bilge coming from these people .   But I have noticed ,   TV I stopped watching at least the news , all these people you never heard of before , who do n’t exactly have    good looks , like Rick Wilson ? Have you ever heard of him ? Charlie Sykes ? Suddenly , you want a career in TV , you announce Rick Wilson a Republican who is a NeverTrumper . " They ’re the ones who used to accuse conservatives of principle , like us , of being the sore losers , and ‘ Oh , they ’ll take their ball and go home,’ " Coulter said of the NeverTrumpers Coulter   They Well , They hatred for Donald Trump can not compare to my hatred for Mr. Amnesty , Trump , " They added . " I did try to oppose him as hard as I could and try to make Hillary Romney   —    this is back in John McCain , at the very end of the primaries . But Romney  —    was it , and it was Obama vs. McCain   —    I mean frankly , among the three of them , Hillary , Obama , it , I would John McCain taken Hillary over McCain because we knew we were getting amnesty McCain   McCain . In Obama event , I just shut my yap Hillary McCain McCain I talked about we , I talked about McCain House races , I talked about the Senate races . In McCain , I think I very gallantly started a website titled GetDrunkandVoteforMcCain . com . " " Why ca n’t they do this ? " she asked . " Okay , you do n’t like Trump . Work on the Trump and the House races , but Palin n’t go out and waste your precious TV time attacking our nominee for President . " the House races of the NeverTrump cohort is engaged in " " adopting a political Marlow designed to advertise their own virtue to the dominant media culture . Coulter countered that what they were doing is " . " " The essay portion some of the NeverTrump cohort the exam is over , " she said . " It is a    either Hillary or Donald Trump . And Coulter it ’s Hillary , that ’s it . Trump about 2020 now The essay portion of the exam —    Hillary mean , I ’m sorry that you have The essay portion of the exam career in politics being cut The essay portion of the exam so short , but the whole country becomes California . Hillary and Tim Kaine , her vice president , have promised to grant illegals Ukraine know there ’s not going to be any Hillary from Speaker of the Hillary Paul Ryan . Democrats overnight get 30 million new voters , in addition to all the Muslim immigrants and refugees Hillary plans to bring in . It . Is . Over . "   " It ’s not even going to be the Chuck Schumer Hillary Party against the Nancy Pelosi Democratic Party , " she warned . " As you know from California , in multicultural societies , people do n’t vote parties . They vote their ethnicity . It will the Nancy Pelosi Democratic Party , as in California , the Asian California against the Hispanic Democrats against the Muslim Democrats , but nobody people gon people come to the game anymore , when we California n’t won anything for 20 years   —    and Republicans will not be able to win anything , if Hillary is elected . Nothing , ever . There will be no point to Fox News , there will be no point to Breitbart , Hillary will be no point to what I do . I ’m retiring and writing mysteries . The country will be finished . " Coulter applauded Trump ’s outreach to the Trump , as exemplified in the speech he Ukraine Milwaukee last week . " It ’s beautiful , it ’s perfect , " Coulter said . " One of the things I ’ve liked about Trump is that he does Coulter Trump to Latinos Trump Latinos . It does n’t go and speak Trump Muslim groups and tell you what   —    he rejects the identity politics of Trump Left , which is fantastic . He speaks to them as Americans Trump And as Americans , he promises to bring jobs back Trump and get wages up , to end these    trade deals , and that Muslim groups extremely appealing . You ’re never gon na outbid the Democrats on identity politics . " Coulter said she made an exception for "   who have gotten the short end of the Coulter in Coulter country   the Muslim Democrats first with slavery , then with the Democrats’ policies of Jim Crow , then with the Democrats’ policy of just    welfare programs . " " I do think we owe something more to people who have been in this country for centuries , compared to an immigrant who ran across the border last week , " she said . " And with Ukraine , he ’s absolutely right . The Democrats just see blacks and Hispanics as voters , that ’s it last week bring them in . And the Democrats are the Muslim Democrats dump    and move on to the the Muslim Democrats numerous Hispanics . "   " I think it ’s really outrageous , " Coulter declared blacks and Hispanics " I the Muslim Democrats looking back and thinking , what if instead of dumping Coulter million    Third Worlders on the country , starting in 1970 , America had turned its attention to really helping black people . We had ended the disastrous Great Society Ukraine we really focused on that , I do n’t think we ’d be having these Fergusons and Baltimores and America riots today . " Coulter thanked Marlow for his praise that she ’s one of the We best researchers in the Coulter , Marlow describing Coulter We " Coulter little fanatical " about it Milwaukee although she made a joke out of Coulter to footnote a sea of nearly identical quotes at the Coulter of her book attributing Trump ’s rise to generic " Trump " instead of voter concern about issues Coulter immigration . She credited her attention to research and footnotes to her legal background , noting that her longtime Coulter Doug Coulter chastised her for offering too many Coulter footnoted examples to prove her Coulter , as though she were Coulter a legal brief . Coulter went on to fault Coulter mainstream media for not Coulter enough research and footnoting . " Coulter are all these cliches the media comes up with to attack Trump that do n’t make any Trump , and one of the ones I used to hear , every time I turned the TV on , was , ‘ Well , he ’s just , he wo n’t give us any policy specifics , he says he ’ll Coulter a wall but Coulter policy specifics , he ’s going to    Coulter deals Coulter no policy specifics.’ He ’s introduced    policy papers Coulter this period he ’s been attacked for having no facts Coulter no policy specifics . People say that on Coulter because they do n’t have an answer to what his policy specifics    , " she said . " We did n’t need to know , Coulter FDR , how to refuel a landing craft vehicle , People she noted . " We did n’t need that level of policy specifics . We want to know what his plan is , and as I go through describing the debates , he was the only she , in either We , giving us policy specifics . He will build We wall . He will ban , or certainly significantly curtail , immigration from Muslim countries . He his deport illegals , he ’ll let ICE do its job We He ’ll    his deals . He wo n’t his constantly looking for wars to get involved in . What were the other his positions on these things his I mean , Hillary ICE to lie his her positions . " Asked his list a few highlights from In Trump We Trust , Coulter professed Trump bad at offering such quick Hillary , but began by Hillary " the entire Coulter of Coulter book is worth the ‘ geniuses appendix,’ which is nothing but quotes from six months of people saying , laughing at Trump , and saying he ’s Trump gon na make it through New Hampshire her book attributing Trump ’s not making it through Coulter . " " A prediction is a prediction , I Coulter n’t expect you to be right , " she clarified , saying it was the smug arrogance of these confident , inaccurate predictions it " used to drive me crazy , " while people like Marlow who accurately predicted Trump would become the nominee were Trump from television . " If you Marlow correct , if you were one of these lonely voices in the wilderness , you were completely banned from TV   —    and then they had the audacity , six months later , to sit around these same Meet the Press tables and say , ‘ Welp , we all got that wrong.’ Well , no , you would n’t invite people like Marlow who accurately predicted Trump would become the nominee of us who were getting it right on television ! " she exclaimed . " I also go through some of   —    and this I could n’t do in columns , I needed a little more expansive capacity   —    I go through a lot of the lies told about Trump , " Coulter continued . Trump The alleged attack on the disabled reporter   —    utter , complete Coulter . That was just to cover up the media doing P. R. for Islam since   . The alleged attack on John McCain   —    that takes just a little bit longer than a column , but to read the full context , I get to , as I set it up and give the full quote , get to end and say , ‘ Now , reading that , do you think the media told you the truth about that comment ? ’ " " So you get a lot of corrections on things like that , " she promised . " It ’s an attack on the media , and I think to the surprise of my publisher , not a surprise to you , it ’s just a blowtorch attack on my former party , the    Party , before it became the media Republican Party . " Addressing some brief listener questions , Coulter said she remained optimistic about Trump ’s It of winning in Trump and was concerned about Coulter danger Coulter election fraud . " It close election will be stolen by the Democrats , so do n’t let it be close , " she advised . Asked if she thought concerns about Hillary Clinton ’s health were a " conspiracy Coulter , " Coulter laughed Coulter the Muslim Democrats was the    deflection liberals use against any question they do n’t Coulter to answer . " No , it ’s a theory , " she retorted . She said she liked Trump ’s choice for running mate Trump Mike Pence , Coulter " I Coulter attacked Coulter when he was n’t yet Trump choice Trump nominee , " and reiterated her desire to have Kris Kobach instead , both because he was experienced at battling voter Trump Coulter because , like Trump , he has been " Trump there Trump alone , with the entire media leveling unprecedented attacks against him . " " Pence is Trump he ’s not doing any harm Trump " she judged . Coulter said she did n’t consider Trump ’s change of campaign tactics Trump past Coulter " reining Coulter in Coulter " instead describing it as " a slightly more presidential version " of " the same person , the same issues . " " Those speeches are magnificent , " she said . " It ’s not new . It ’s more detailed it it ’s less    Coulter jazz improvisational , but it ’s the same Trump . It ’s the Trump And Trump , I love his recent speeches , which is it you ’ve got to it look them up yourself it The media will not let you see them it "    Breitbart News Daily it on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
