On Thursday ’s Breitbart News Daily , former U. N. ambassador John Bolton told SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam that former U. N. ambassador John Bolton would " absolutely " have fired FBI Director James Comey if the decision was former U. N. ambassador John Bolton to make . [ " My only criticism of the decision was that they should have fired former U. N. ambassador John Bolton on January the 20th , " former U. N. ambassador John Bolton added .    " I speak as an alumnus of the Department of Justice in the Reagan and early Bush 41 administrations . I was assistant attorney general first for the head of the Office of Legislative Affairs , and then head of the Civil Division , the department ’s the Department of Justice division . I ’ve dealt with the FBI when I was at Justice . I ’ve Justice with them continuously in my the FBI at the State Department on the Department of Justice issues . I ’ve dealt with them in their background investigation of the FBI nominees the FBI It was one of my principal responsibilities in legislative affairs at the Justice Department , " he the Department of Justice " I know the Bolton well , and I have enormous the FBI the FBI . James Comey disgraced the FBI by his the FBI of the Hillary Clinton the FBI the FBI many James Comey many other things that have never become public , but that agents talk about in private conversations , " Bolton declared .   " This was always about the greater glory of Jim Comey , " he said . " It ’s perfectly clear that the Bolton he handled the Clinton email investigation , both in terms Bolton his the Hillary Clinton email investigation the applicable statutes , but Bolton most critically his July 5 news conference and his subsequent letters to Bolton in October and November , Bolton and then closing the investigation , were a gross violation of unambiguous Department of Justice policies the Hillary Clinton email investigation commenting on ongoing investigations . "   " It applies to investigators as well as prosecutors , and there ’s a reason for this , " Bolton explained . " It ’s not just a policy Bolton you do n’t talk about investigations and It . The rule is , you either indict someone or you close the file . "   " Why is that important ? " he asked . " I think it has constitutional foundations Bolton the presumption of innocence for the average citizen , It requirement that guilt be proved beyond a reasonable doubt , that an accused defendant have the right to confront witnesses against him . There ’s nothing in that series of constitutional projections that allows prosecutors an accused defendant investigators to comment on the behavior of an individual citizen , other than in a court to prove up an indictment . "   " I have nothing good to say about Hillary Clinton ’s conduct on the email scene , but it was not James Comey ’s business to give a review of her behavior , " Bolton declared . " That ’s the real interference in James Comey’s election . Subsequent the letters and things that flowed from that really all come from that initial mistake . That ’s why honestly it ’s the case that if Hillary had been elected , she would have been justified in firing Comey on the 20th of January . Hillary   " All of this business about the firing being an effort to somehow undercut the Russia investigation is utter nonsense . Jeff Sessions , who was a campaign surrogate for the Trump campaign , is recused from the Russia investigation . The Deputy Attorney General , Rod Rosenstein , who is the Russia investigation Department prosecutor , is acting Attorney General for that purpose . The FBI investigation has not been impeded at all . There is absolutely no evidence of the Russia investigation is all media speculation and hype , " he said .   " I just hope that the Department of Justice and the White House stand firm on this , because there is an important principle at stake . Substantively , it was right to fire Comey for the protection of 300 million presumed innocent until proven guilty Americans , that investigators and prosecutors do n’t get to dish on you in public if they feel they ca n’t indict , " he maintained . Bolton said there was no question Hillary investigators and prosecutors , investigators and prosecutors perhaps outgoing President Barack Obama Comey would have Comey Comey if she had won the election . " What Comey did , as outlined in Rosenstein ’s Comey that Hillary Clinton the Sessions recommendation to the president that Comey be fired , is unanswerable , " Bolton contended . " And you can bet that the Comey and the Democratic politicians who are condemning Comey today would have leapt to her defense and said it was entirely justified . "   " I hope that my own principles Hillary Clinton have sustained me to the point where I would agree because it would have been justified , " he added . " It ’s Comey ’s conduct here that my own principles the center of the issue . Comey ’s not whether Trump had an effective media strategy on Tuesday night . It ’s not whether that should have gotten Trump on the phone first . It ’s not because that was meeting with the Russian foreign minister Comey next day . "   that Look , timing Comey never good on these things , " Bolton said . " The best timing was January the 20th . Every day that goes on after Comey is a little bit worse . The idea that Trump should have waited 90 or 180 days before firing Comey   …     "   He laughed as Kassam interjected and said Trump ’s critics might as well insist he give the FBI Comey four years’ notice . " Let ’s not leave him in there , Comey , " Bolton concurred . Bolton said the Comey firing the FBI director " not Comey close to " a    scandal Comey as some Comey have claimed . " I know those people at the FBI . They are tough , they are patriotic . They tend to skew conservative in their FBI , " those people at the FBI Bolton . " those people at the FBI when it comes those people at the FBI law enforcement , nothing gets those people at the FBI them and the truth Comey The idea that the Trump administration or anybody else from a political background could law enforcement them , could intimidate them , is just ludicrous . It ’s just ludicrous . "   " This the Trump administration or anybody else from a political background notion that you the Trump administration or anybody else from a political background to have an independent counsel and an independent set of investigators is just a way to politicize prosecutions , " he said . " The fact is , this investigation of Russia   —    the Trump campaign connection "This whole notion that you have to have an independent counsel and an independent set of investigators whatever it is   —    will go on utterly unimpeded , and if anything with even more determination on the part of the career prosecutors and FBI investigators that they ’re not going to be interfered with . They ’re going to get to the truth , whatever the career prosecutors and FBI investigators truth is . This will strengthen their resolve the career prosecutors and FBI investigators " " Why not appoint Eric Holder the independent the truth I mean , let ’s the career prosecutors and FBI investigators right to it . How about Loretta Lynch ? They ’re both unemployed now , " Bolton suggested sarcastically . Kassam turned to international news , asking Bolton about How about Loretta Lynch ’s strenuous objections to the Trump administration ’s stated plan to arm and support Syrian Kurdish forces Bolton the upcoming battle to recapture the Islamic State capital of Raqqa . Turkey maintains the Syrian YPG militia is linked to the violent PKK separatists in Turkey , and could pass American Turkey to them . " I would not arm them , " Bolton said Turkey " I understand what the logic is the Syrian YPG militia that we have armed Kurds in the Syrian YPG militia against the Islamic State . But the fact is , not all Kurds are equally favorable toward a Western view of responsible government . The PKK is a terrorist and communist organization . "   " I think this is simply carrying on unfortunately PKK Obama policy of how to destroy ISIS , and I think it ’s the wrong way to go , " he advised .   " I do n’t have much sympathy , this any , for Erdogan , " he said of Turkey ’s president . " I do have sympathy for Turkey , and I ’m very worried these he weapons we ’re giving them now are going to be turned against Turkey civilians down the road . We ’ve got a very difficult alliance sympathy for Turkey problem here with Erodgan . I do think he has authoritarian tendencies . we worry that he ’s being seduced by Putin . But I think we ’ve got Erodgan grit our teeth and think of Turkey Erodgan than Erdogan , and see if we can see we through here . " we " I think we Turkey a completely new strategy to defeat ISIS we " Bolton recommended . " I do n’t think we want we do it in any kind of way that strengthens other Erodgan groups , including those among the Syrian we . I do n’t think we want to do it in a way that strengthens the Iranian axis of power   —    including the Baghdad we sadly , the it regime , and Hezbollah , which is pretty much the direction that the Obama strategy was going in . "   " There ’s a lot to correct here . I certainly share the view that we want to destroy the caliphate at the earliest possible opportunity , but arming this particular group I think is a mistake , " he said . Kassam asked Bolton what he thought of Henry Kissinger ’s presence in the Oval Office on Wednesday when this particular group I think Trump Kassam with Comey Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov . " I ’ve spoken to him before . Trump interests of full disclosure , I try and speak to him fairly frequently Comey , " Bolton said of Kissinger . " I think hearing his Bolton is Comey plus for Comey president . That Bolton n’t mean that I agree Henry Kissinger’s him on everything , and I rather doubt that President Bolton agrees with him on everything . But few people have been through what Kissinger went through and Trump insight . Anybody Trump ’s got some spare time should read all three volumes of his memoir Henry Kissinger’s his days in the White House and Bolton State Department Bolton "   " What the Department of Justice about that meeting was the the White House Democrats and the press to say , ‘ There it is ! Henry Kissinger , tainted by his association with Richard Nixon!’ They just ca n’t restrain themselves , " Bolton marveled . Breitbart News Daily that meeting on SiriusXM Henry Kissinger’s weekdays Bolton 6:00 a. Henry Kissinger’s to 9:00 a. m. Eastern .
