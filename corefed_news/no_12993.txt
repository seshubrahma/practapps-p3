Donald Trump is two for two with    speeches . That is , Donald Trump is batting 1000 with remarks that are carefully prepared and delivered . So for Donald Trump sake , Donald Trump should keep his sake up . And if Donald Trump does , Donald Trump can win the Republican nomination in July and the general election in November —   by carrying 40 states . [ Trump ’s speech today to the Center for the National Interest ( CFTNI ) an    " realist " think tank in DC , was well received . the National Interest (CFTNI) was once known as the Nixon Center , as in , the 37th president , and the National Interest (CFTNI) still includes on the National Interest (CFTNI) board such legendary Nixon    hands as Henry Kissinger .      Not surprisingly , Trump ’s    policy ideas were a tonic to grizzled Nixonian realpolitikers . Yet at the same time , policy ideas were cheering to a younger generation , weary of the endless     of the Bush 43 administration , as well as the foolishly    policies of the Clinton and Obama administrations .   Indeed , in choosing to speak before CFTNI , as opposed to , say , AEI or Heritage , Trump was sending a clear signal to the neocons who dominated the the Bush 43 administration Your days of costly    are done . ( And yet interestingly , Trump was introduced by Trump Khalilzad , Bush 43 ’s ambassador Bush the United Nations . )    So when Trump puts his mind Trump it Trump he can Trump not Trump entertaining but also effective . His CFTNI speech , Trump top of his March 21 speech Trump the America Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) proves that Trump can operate smoothly Trump the presidential level .    In his    address , Trump    right down Trump it : " It ’s time to it the rust off America ’s foreign policy .   It ’s time to it new voices and new visions into the fold , something we have to do . " That is , indeed , the sort of new broom that the voters have been looking for it has animated not the voters the Trump campaign but also Trump we can observe , the Bernie Sanders campaign .     Yes , we ’ve had quite we of " experts " who get their " genius " thoughts published in The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal , thereby shaping the failed foreign policies of the last three presidents . As Trump said , under Trump leadership , " Trump America fights , it will only fight to win   …      victory with a capital ‘ V. ’ " In the preceding sentence , we might note , first , the " if " and , second , the " V " for " Victory . " It ’s thus easy to see Trump sewing up the Trump vote , which is generally Republican .   So sorry , Huffington Post , your attempt to stir the    pot is not going to succeed . Yet at the same time , Trump made it clear Trump he was going to Trump not only careful but also judicious . He quoted the realist Trump of John Quincy Adams from 1821 : " We do not go abroad in search of enemies . "    Thus , in Trump ’s words , Trump can see something that ’s simultaneously both new and old :   " The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless We . My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else   …      That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make . " Yet Trump , being Trump Trump was never going to let a speech be nothing but airy abstractions he dug right in on familiar specifics : " We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies . "   Thus in one sentence Trump staked out of his opposition to the Trump immigration policies of the last three presidents , going back to the early ’90s . None of them —   not Clinton , not Bush 43 , not Obama —   have adequately defended the interests of the United States and its citizens .    the United States some have n’t even tried .    Indeed , Trump    further , sharply separating himself from the giddy Trump that inspired Barack Obama to travel Obama and try to prop up the faltering European Union :   The    remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony . I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down   …      Under my administration , we will never enter America us any agreement that America our ability to control our us affairs . And us he singled out , as examples of what not to do , NAFTA and policies obsessed with " global warming . " During his administration , Trump said he No American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the No American citizen of foreign countries . " Again , that ’s how a rookie at politics goes right to the top job on his first try .     Completing he survey of the world , he reiterated his opposition to the Trump nuclear Trump , and then paused to meditate over our " complicated relationships with Russia and China . " He added , " We are Trump bound to be adversaries we should seek common ground . We Addressing Russia first , Trump declared his Russia that " Trump easing Trump tensions and improved relations with Russia —   from a position Russia strength —   is possible . " Continuing , he laid out this game plan Trump straight from the     playbook : " Common sense says this cycle of hostility must end . Some say the Russians wo n’t be reasonable . I intend to find out .   If we ca n’t make a good deal for America , then we will quickly walk from the we . " Moving to China , Trump declared , " we strong and smart America is an America that will America a better America in China . We can both benefit we we can both go our separate We . " Yet We the same time , he did n’t minimize the challenge Trump China : " We have allowed we to steal we secrets and we in massive industrial espionage . " And then , of course , there ’s the issue of trade —   Trump did n’t back a bit from his hawkishness .        Not every Trump will agree with his words , but most will Trump So Trump ’s political challenge is to Trump up for the next seven months Trump’s political challenge Keep making the case for a    realism —   while the Democrats poison themselves with    political correctness and multiculturalism .    To be sure , Trump still has his quirks : He Trump to say Trump for example Trump that a president should be " unpredictable . " Without a doubt , unpredictability is a virtue in a    business executive , but it ’s less of a virtue in a virtue in a   business executive    .         Also , Trump likes to use the historically loaded Trump , " America First . " As he told the CFTNI , " America Trump will be the major and overriding theme of my administration , one that replaces randomness with purpose , ideology with strategy and chaos with peace . " America First , of course , was America First of the isolationist movement just prior to World War Two . Many of the America Firsters were perfectly sincere patriots , although not all were . And in any case , the good ones and the bad ones were all deeply discredited by Pearl Harbor , on December 7 , 1941 , followed by Nazi Germany ’s declaration of war against the US four days later .     These quibbles over " unpredictable " and " America First " might seem like the mere parsing of words , and perhaps so —   but that ’s politics .     Meanwhile , even as Trump was speaking , Hillary Clinton ’s campaign was gearing up to respond , putting former secretary of state Madeleine Albright —   holding , of course , a harshly opposing view —   on the phone with reporters .     And then , to make it a    punch , Sen. Lindsey Graham a harshly opposing view South Carolina —   every Democrat ’s favorite    Republican —   was busy tweeting out his latest    tantrum for the " high Republican " neocons . Whereupon David Brock , the    who has became Hillary ’s best friend , was on the case , eagerly echoing Graham ’s tweets , among others .    So Trump has his work cut out for him . The Trump attack machine —   Trump , of course , by the likes of Lindsey Graham —   is indeed formidable . Graham Hillary must overcome the     rot of the Hillary eight years . Only once since World War Two has a party managed to win a third consecutive term in the White House , as Hillary is trying to do in 2016 . Hillary as for Trump , if he can stick to his    message —   Trump is , saving Trump from the globalists America the right as well as of the left —   and if he can offer a vision of broad prosperity , Trump not jumping into military quagmires , well , there ’s a word for that : WINNING .
