Thursday on his nationally syndicated radio show , conservative talker Rush Limbaugh dismissed the possibility of President Donald Trump working alongside Democrats as " fantasy . "   conservative talker Rush Limbaugh said "fantasy would come to an end when Democrats filibuster the Supreme Court confirmation vote of Judge Neil Gorsuch likely to happen next month , which conservative talker Rush Limbaugh said will be done out of a necessity for Democrats to fundraise . Transcript as follows ( courtesy of Rushlimbaugh . com ) : Now , folks , I did not mean to cause any undue concern here . Let me close the loop , dot the I ’s and cross the T ’s . This fantasy of working with the Democrats , and the New York Times clearly is hot and bothered . The the New York Times when you read this editorial , they ’re clearly in the New York Times advanced stages of foreplay . They ’re on the the New York Times , they think that it the New York Times gon na this editorial . I ’m gon na tell you , they ’re gon na the New York Times a cold shower , everybody is . This This fantasy of working with the Democrats gon na be put the Democrats on April 7th or whenever the Senate votes on Gorsuch and the Democrats filibuster it . ‘ Cause I the Democrats care what the Freedom Caucus the Senate done , when it comes down to Gorsuch , the Democrats are not gon na Cause for the the Democrats Gorsuch they have to , they ’ll filibuster him . The the Democrats of the game the Democrats resistance . That ’s how the guy Democrats keep their donations coming in . It ’s the Democrats DNC is the Democrats na be reconstituted , resistance , resistance , oppose . Hillary was out there talking about it in San Francisco in the black leather jacket . You think that was an accidental wardrobe choice ? Ha . Hardly . So Trump ’s gon na get angry all over again at the Democrats when they filibuster Gorsuch . I was watching Lindsey the Democrats TV today the Democrats Lindsey Grahamnesty is a guy , the last thing in the world that he would Lindsey Grahamnesty to do is pull the nuclear option . Preserve the Senate rules Lindsey Grahamnesty But he was loaded for bear today talking about the Democrats . He said ( paraphrasing ) Lindsey Grahamnesty If they ca n’t vote for Neil Gorsuch , then Lindsey Grahamnesty ’s clear there ’s not a the Democrats judge any Republican would ever nominate they would vote for . " I ’m sitting there saying , are you just now the Democrats this out ? But I ’ll take it , if he ’s just now figuring it out . So they ’re gon na this Gorsuch . Lindsey Grahamnesty you hear what Pelosi this about Gorsuch ? the Democrats know you guys Neil Gorsuch know you get tired of me sometimes being repetitive Neil Gorsuch but I ’m telling you , I only repeat what they say Pelosi Did you hear what Pelosi said ’m Gorsuch ? I ’m paraphrasing , it you guys pretty close . " If you Pelosi water and Neil Gorsuch air , ’m need to oppose Neil Gorsuch . " I know . I know . The Republicans are blamed for all this Neil Gorsuch there . And you do n’t think anybody takes it seriously . The question is , why is Nancy Pelosi not laughed and hooted out of politics with a comment like that ? Why does anybody give her any credence whatsoever ? And yet the media and Democrat analysts talk about that , " She Nancy Pelosi brilliant . That ’s a brilliant strategy , to blame the guy for dirty water and Nancy Pelosi air . " It ’s akin to Republicans want to destroy the planet . Why do Republicans want to destroy where they live ? But the Democrats live and die with this stuff . She uses it because it Republicans works , is the problem , and it works with the lunatics Nancy Pelosi send this stuff money this stuff vote for her . Imagine , if you this stuff drinking water   —    it Nancy Pelosi not a matter of Nancy Pelosi you have to do that . And if you like breathing this stuff Neil Gorsuch is not your judge , as though Gorsuch is gon na try to stop you from drinking water , breathing air , or poison it Neil Gorsuch It ’s just absurd .
