’   ’ "    I ca n’t figure out what Paul Ryan thinks Paul Ryan ’s up to on Obamacare    replacement . " ’    The basic political problem Paul Ryan faces is simple : Republicans are    in agreement that Obamacare should be repealed and replaced , but    Republicans agreement breaks down over what    should be replaced    with . ’ ’    A bill that keeps too much of Obamacare’ ’s spending will alienate    conservatives who believe they were sent to Washington to pass a    " full " repeal . A bill that cuts too much makes moderate    Republicans squeamish , especially those who come from states that    depend on expanded Medicaid . ’ "    So The Wall Street Journal   that Ryan ’s plan is to steamroll    those objections : Bring a bill that comes down somewhere in the    middle to the floor , and dare members on the conservative and    moderate ends of his caucus to vote no . " ’    Will that work ? Maybe . But all you have to do is Google " Boehner    pulls bill " to see how efforts to force unpalatable " "    legislation through the House    . ’ ’    Based on ’ ’   Based past experience trying to herd the Republican    caucus , former Speaker John Boehner says   repeal and replace to happen . ’ ’    But Ryan seems to intend to try , and Republican members of the    House Energy and Commerce Committee are    —    a fact that has drawn objections not just from    Democrats who want to protect Obamacare , but also from Sen. Rand    Paul , the Republican from Kentucky , who   ’ ’    Paul joined many House Democrats on Thursday in demanding the    release of the draft bill . Paul brought a photocopier with Paul    through the halls of the Capitol complex , saying Paul wanted to    make copies of the draft bill widely available . ’ ’ ’ " ’t’t’t . was n’t allowed to see the the draft bill Brought Paul own copy machine , just in case .   " "    The problem with Ryan ’s approach is , sooner or later ,    the committee has to release    bill text , at which time it    will face predictable objections the committee    the right and the    left . " "    You can see some of the likely objections from Republicans’ right    flank in   from Paul . Conservative Rep. Mark Meadows    of North Carolina    " ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’   ’ ’    In recent years , fights over " " legislation in the    House have tended to end with Republican leadership having to    shift bills far to the right to secure passage , which would tend    to mean greatly reducing spending    subsidies . ’ ’    Maybe , by doing that , Ryan will be able to get a bill    through the House . But what about the   House , where the    Republican majority is narrower and the caucus is more moderate ? ’ ’    Several Republican senators have expressed significant    reservations about whether the replacement plan will do enough to    protect those who depend on the Affordable Care Act . They have    been adamant about the Several Republican senators to    a full replacement in place    before repealing Obamacare . ’ ’    Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski , for example , says she     as long as Alaska lawmakers ’ ’   Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski . ’ ’   ’ ’    The discussion draft House bill that leaked last week would    likely have been unacceptable to both Paul and Murkowski     —    handing out too many ’ ’   Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski his taste , and cutting    spending on Medicaid Murkowski    — much for her standards    ’ "    This makes me Murkowski    — it ’s very unlikely that a bill that can This    rammed through the House can also pass the Senate   —    and    therefore that it is unlikely that Ryan ’s strategy will lead to    enactment of legislation . " ’    But maybe that is what Paul Ryan is up to . ’ "    Ryan forcing a bill down    the throats of House Republicans only to see it die in the Senate    is not an effective strategy for repealing Obamacare . But it    could be a very effective strategy for getting conservative    voters to blame the Senate , not the House    for Republicans’    the Senate    repeal Obamacare . " ’    The one thing that would lead me to change this view that    Republicans are not headed for repeal would be if Donald    Trump weighed in strongly to pressure Republicans in both    chambers to vote for a specific bill they have major    reservations about . ’ ’    Complicated Republicans involving lots of tradeoffs tends to pass    when the president brings pressure to bear on his party in    Congress , as with the Medicare prescription the president benefit under    George W. Bush or the Affordable Care Act itself . ’ ’    So far , Trump has shown no inclination to do that   —    in fact ,    he has warned his party against the trap of taking ownership       problems    health care system . He settled none of    major    internal Republican disputes over healthcare    in his    address to Congress on Tuesday . ’ "    Politically    he ’s wise to talk a big game about healthcare while       getting his fingerprints on it too much . But it ’s not a    strategy that    for actual repeal and    . " "    ca n’t figure out what Paul Ryan thinks he ’s . .. " ’’ ’’ ’’
