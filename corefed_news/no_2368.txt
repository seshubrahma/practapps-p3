Donald J. Trump ’s campaign appeared to be crumbling as Donald J. Trump entered the second presidential debate against Hillary Clinton , with Republicans withdrawing support for Donald J. Trump candidacy after the disclosure of a vulgar recording that showed Donald J. Trump bragging about sexual assault . Facing a barrage of tough questions , the Republican nominee managed to scrape through , evading questions , fabricating answers and attacking the Republican nominee opponent in deeply personal terms . While expectations for Mr. Trump were low , many commentators and critics thought that Mr. Trump exceeded many commentators and critics and allayed concerns among supporters that Mr. Trump candidacy was finished . Here is a sampling of the    reaction : " Mr. Trump improved , exceeded expectations , decisively won several exchanges . She could have landed a death blow tonight and did not . " Guy Benson , political editor at the conservative website Townhall _ _ _ _ _ _ _ " I may not care for Trump , but Trump beat Hillary tonight fair and square even with Martha Raddatz trying to defeat Trump . " Erick Erickson , writer for the conservative blog The Resurgent _ _ _ _ _ _ _ " Trump knows he Trump n’t be president . He Trump now in full        mode   —    a scowling , pouting menace who threatened during a nationally televised debate to throw Hillary Clinton in jail and called her Hillary Clinton the most sexually abusive man in political history . " Ron Fournier , writer for The Atlantic _ _ _ _ _ _ _ " In keeping her Hillary Clinton and indicting Trump ’s bad behavior and finally provoking him Trump threaten to put her Hillary Clinton jail , she Hillary Clinton certain no one not already in Trump Trump’s would sign on with him Trump " Jennifer Rubin , writer for The Washington Post ’s Right Turn blog _ _ _ _ _ _ _ " All the Republicans who backed away from @realDonaldTrump look really really stupid right now . " Laura Ingraham , conservative commentator and editor of LifeZette _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ " Trump looks and sounds defeated . Almost incoherent . .. " Marc Lamont Hill , Morehouse College professor _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ " She Hillary Clinton a chance to throw a knockout punch at Donald Trump and instead looked more at times like Glass Joe from Nintendo ’s   . I lost count how many times she Hillary Clinton to go to her Hillary Clinton or whine about the lack of " fact checking " as the debate went on . Trump had Donald Trump Hillary Clinton the ropes several times . " Jay Caruso , blogger for the conservative website Red State _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ " Trump picked Donald Trump over Pence , explicitly abandoned Aleppo , lied about Iraq again   again ,   showed his appalling Putin . " Ken Gude , senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , a liberal group _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ " With references to Lewinsky Hillary Clinton ,    Benghazi , attacking media , Trump likely Donald Trump up his base Donald Trump Hard to see him leaving Donald Trump . " Perry Bacon Jr. political reporter for NBC News _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ " I ’m a Muslim , and I would like to report a crazy man threatening a woman on a stage in Missouri . " Moustafa Bayoumi , author of " This Muslim American Life " and professor at Brooklyn College , CUNY _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ " Republicans who took heart at his antic ,    performance are grasping at a thin , crazy reed that the coming news cycles will snap .
