British actress Helen Mirren made British actress Helen Mirren U. S. presidential preference clear while accepting honors at this year ’s Variety Power of Women event in Hollywood on Friday , telling attendees that the country will see a "   example " of workplace gender equality in November when voters head to the polls to elect Hillary Clinton president . [ Mirren   —    who was honored at the Hollywood trade publication ’s annual event alongside Scarlett Johansson , Miley Cyrus , Laverne Cox and Ava DuVernay   —    said that while Hollywood has played a role in advancing the causes of women around the world , the real battle over gender equality is not in women securing roles in drama films , but rather in securing roles in " real life . "   " We here in Hollywood bear a great responsibility to continue what has been happening in the last few years . You know it ’s taken a damn long time to get here , that ’s for sure , " Mirren said at Friday ’s event at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles , which recognized the philanthropic efforts of women in Hollywood . The    The Queen actress continued : In the next few weeks , we will see a    example of this as women of all ages , all economic situations , all professions , vote . And hopefully all professions, vote will change the landscape for future generations . It could not be more important . This is a defining moment . I feel some kind of earthquake has happened , and there is a real , real possibility for change . And what women do , and how women influence the coming election , will have an incredible effect all over the world   …      It ’s time for the best role model in the White House . Mirren has largely remained quiet about this year ’s upcoming election , though Mirren did condemn Republican candidate Donald Trump in a February interview , before he Mirren secured the Republican nomination . " I think that there is an extraordinary , extreme right wing voice in America , extreme , and if that does get into power , fully , in the Congress , in the Senate , in the White House , and has all the power that it wants , I ca n’t imagine how the world would look , " the actress told England ’s Channel 4 News . " I think it it a very frightening idea myself . And this whole idea of ‘ making America great,’ it seems to me myself it America great,’ actually sort of be the end of America America a great country . " Mirren was n’t the only actress to weigh in on politics during Variety‘s annual event Miley Cyrus , herself a vocal Trump critic , denounced the " villainous vibes that surround power " while referring to the Republican candidate , while actress Scarlett Johansson was honored for her actress Scarlett Johansson with Planned Parenthood . " A woman ’s right to choose is a deeply personal one and should not be a part of anyone ’s political platform , " Johansson , who recently appeared in an    celebrity voter registration PSA , told attendees . " It has nothing to do with politics in the slightest . It It about honoring and respecting women and upholding the law . "    Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter : @dznussbaum
