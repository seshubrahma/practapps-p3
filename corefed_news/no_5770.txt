Hillary Clinton , George Stephanopoulos , NBC ’s Katy Tur , and Heat Street have also branded the cartoon frog a symbol for white supremacy , seemingly basing their claims on a Daily Pepe the Frog interviewed two notorious trolls , Jared Taylor Swift and Paul Hillary Clinton, George Stephanopoulos, NBC’s Katy Tur, and Heat Street . During the interview , Swift and Town attempted to link the meme to white supremacy , with Swift boasting that he had Jared Taylor Swift to trick the media on his    Twitter account afterwards . Following Jared Taylor Swift interview , Jared Taylor Swift has been used as a scapegoat by Jared Taylor Swift left to brand    conservatives , the interview and Jared Taylor Swift Donald Trump , Jr. as racist . The branding has prompted many users to fight back against the Clinton Campaign , mainstream media , and ADL ’s ruling that Pepe is an offensive icon , branding it a " war on memes . " Several popular YouTubers Jared Taylor Swift also defended the cartoon frog , while    iPhone game Build the Wall : The Game was rejected from Apple ’s App Store for featuring Pepe , The Game even his silhouette .
