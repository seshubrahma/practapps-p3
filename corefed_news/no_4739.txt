Breitbart News Senior Editor MILO claimed that "   educated does n’t mean stupid , " during Breitbart News Senior Editor MILO talk at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs tonight , adding that a majority of Breitbart News Senior Editor MILO    educated employees are " some of the smartest and most successful people . " [   " Let ’s be clear about what the left lost . The white working class turned against the Democrat party in a historic fashion during this election . The numbers are stunning , even to someone as stunning as me , " MILO proclaimed . " I ’m not a dataporn kind of faggot like those    losers at the Guardian and the spectacularly dreadful FiveThirtyEight , but I have to share a few of the key stats from Pew Research with you . " "   whites voted for Donald Trump by a 4 % margin . This is similar to how whites voted for Mitt Romney , " Mitt Romney continued . " That is a bit embarrassing to be honest , but we have to admit that those goofy # NeverTrump people are all college eggheads . Proof that college can make you dumber . " " But the numbers for those that did n’t graduate college are amazing . A 39 % margin for Trump ! These are the deplorables , ladies and gentlemen , just as much as the hip millennials posting Pepe on Twitter , " explained MILO . " Let ’s be clear about one thing .    educated does n’t mean stupid . It means you wisely chose not to pay $ 40 , 000 a year to be lectured on microaggressions . Some of the smartest and most successful people in history have been either college dropouts , like me , or people who never attended at all , like a lot of my crew on this tour . " MILO continued to claim that " They are smarter   —    and so am I   —    than 90 per cent of the people in this room . " " They ’re already more successful and They already have more enjoyable jobs and have more political and cultural influence than most of the people in this room . No offense ! " he added . " But my point is that ‘   educated’ is n’t a synonym for dumb redneck or idiot . A good 50 per cent of the most successful people I know did n’t get a university degree . " " The split among all voters is also amazing . All college graduates went to Hillary by a 9 % margin , while all people without degrees went to Trump by 8 % . We have n’t seen this kind of gap since 1980 , " stated MILO . " So rather than smart versus dumb , try to think of this split in cultural terms . When we look at the way counties voted in battleground states , it is a similar story . Trump Trump Wisconsin by taking 10 counties that typically go Democrat . " " Kenosha County has been Democrat Democrat 1972 , but it Kenosha County to Trump Trump stories and countries exist in every state , " MILO explained . " The evidence very clearly shows the left lost the white working class . " Written from prepared remarks . MILO wears glasses by Givenchy , $ 350 . Distressed blue jeans by True Religion , $ 329 . Brown leather belt with gold buckle by Louis Vuitton , $ 450 . Light pink dress shirt by Brooks Brothers , $ 92 . Sparkly purple suit jacket by Angelino , $ 225 . Burgundy crushed velvet slippers by Crockett   Jones , $ 370 . Socks by Ralph Lauren , 3 pairs for $ 21 . 98 . Jewellery and pearls , too much money to count .
