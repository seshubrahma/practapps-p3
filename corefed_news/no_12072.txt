From Khizr Khan writing at CNN :   I have implored Trump to study the Constitution , I have implored the Republican leadership to rebuke Trump rhetoric and policies . But too often they have stayed quiet . America is already great   —    our experience speaks to that . And the truth is , no single man can lay claim to the idea of making it great . That is why I implore Americans considering voting for a man who claims that only he can make the America to think again . I ask them to Americans their better Americans come November   —    to reject fear , reject hatred , reject division . America , embrace your neighbor , embrace liberty , justice and freedom for all . Choose a uniter . Choose a healer . Choose the most qualified candidate   —    Hillary Clinton , not Donald Trump .
