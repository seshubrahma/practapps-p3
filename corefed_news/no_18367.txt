’   ’ ’    President Donald Trump’ ’s ambitious trade agenda has been caught    up by what one reformer compared to something out of a movie ,    complete with a " civil war " type scene between competing factions    of    nascent administration . ’ ’    The early acts of this film proved disappointing to some of       trade allies , even as    administration crossed the    mark    by pointing to a withdrawal from the    Partnership ,    an increased emphasis on enforcement of trade laws already on the    books , and a series of executive orders aimed fulfilling at       campaign promises . ’ "    But as NAFTA renegotiation or withdrawal remains at the starting    gate , a number of Goldman Sachs executives maintain      positions in the administration , and Trump has softened Trump    stance on China to help deal with North Korea , those aligned with    the president ’s trade platform are increasingly cautious in those aligned with   the president’s trade platform    expectations . Trump opponents are beginning to breathe a sigh of    relief . " ’    " I think the end of the movie has not been written for how Trump    is going to or not going to enact Trump    promised trade policy    changes , " said   head    of Public Citizen’ ’s Global Trade Watch , which supports the trade    Trump    Trump    on the campaign trail . " I would say that    Act 1 has been extremely disappointing , and Act 2 is some kind of    Civil War scene . But we won’’t know what Act 3 is for some time . " ’ ’    The civil war has played out between the two wings of his    administration . One , the " New York " wing , contains figures such    as National Economic Council Chair Gary Cohn . The more hawkish    Trump trade wing of the White House includes National Trade    Council Chair Peter Navarro and chief strategist Steve Bannon ,    the administration’ ’s foremost nationalist . ’ "    The latter camp gained an important ally this week when the    Senate finally confirmed Robert Lighthizer to be the US trade    representative , clearing the way for more centralized approach to    the president ’s trade ambitions . " ’    But in a recent battle on the the North American Free Trade    Agreement , the " globalists " won . Navarro and Bannon drafted a    letter that would have announced the US’ ’s intention to withdraw    from the    agreement with Canada and Mexico . Trump was    reportedly just days from pulling out of the deal . ’ ’    At what seemed to be the last moment , several administration    officials , including Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and    Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross , talked him out of the withdrawal .    Calls from Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Canadian    Prime Minister Justin Trudeau   rather than an    imminent withdrawal . ’ ’   ’ ’    " I think there are two things that are going on , " Wallach said .       The sort of conventional wisdom version is , which I think is       wrong , ’’ Ah , there is finally adult supervision ’’ or , ’’ Wow ,       has finally caught up with Trump’ ’s economic policies . ’’ " ’ ’    She outlined the " Civil War " she She : ’ "    The apparent conflict that has trade allies a bit uneasy , to say       least , has Trump ’s trade opponents feeling good . " ’    " I think early on , there was a lot of concern , " Lee Branstetter ,    a Carnegie Mellon University professor who served on President    Barack Obama’ ’s Council of Economic Advisers from 2011 through    2012 , told Business Insider . " What he was saying in the campaign ,    what was in the offing once he he office would be a radical    departure from the five or six decades of , you know , fairly       support for open trade and investment policies . " ’ ’    " This was quite radical rhetoric , " he he . " But what we’’ve    encountered so far is , I think aptly , is somewhat satirically    characterized as ’’ speak loudly and carry a small stick . ’’ " ’ "    Still , many trade reformers are encouraged by several of Trump ’s    steps , even if they many trade reformers equally dismayed by other actions . And    they many trade reformers Lighthizer ’s confirmation as a positive step . Without    Lighthizer Lighthizer , the top 10 politically appointed positions    at the USTR ’s office that need Senate confirmation remained    unfilled as a result . " ’    That , as some experts noted , is the prime reason why a draft    NAFTA renegotiation letter delivered to Congress by the    administration in late March was less than exciting to many trade    reformers . A representative from Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown’ ’s    office told Business Insider that Brown , one of Congress Congress top    trade hawks , felt it was weak on a number of key areas . Wallach    said the letter " did not do any of the things that would be    necessary to deliver on his Wallach    pledge that his Wallach       policy will bring down the trade deficit and create more    manufacturing jobs . " ’ ’   ’ "    The White House told Business Insider that the slow process    surrounding Lighthizer ’s confirmation should be blamed on    Democratic obstruction . A White   The White House said that without    Lighthizer in place , it would be difficult to start a number of    initiatives they have in mind . " ’    The official A White House official that the " civil war " perceived by some    allies was stalling the White House’ ’s trade agenda , the saying    the evidence doesn’’t back up the narrative . ’ ’    " These strong orders on trade and these significant judgments    being rendered from Commerce and significant penalties being    assessed , " the official said A White House official note of Trump’ ’s executive    order calling for an investigation into steel imports , as well as    the recent tariffs . " It’ ’s all been action , and it’ ’s going to It’’s all continue being that way . " ’ ’    " That’ ’s all stuff the president talked about during the    campaign , " the official continued . " So I think , yeah , of course    everyone wants to talk about palace intrigue and it works with       the rest    the press is saying about the White House . But I    think , especially    terms of trade , if you look at what’ ’s    actually happening , it’ ’s a pretty strong case that the president    is following through on that promise . " ’ ’    The administration official repeatedly pointed to the withdrawal    from TPP as the administration’ ’s biggest move on trade , when it    pulled out the administration’’s what was President Barack Obama’ ’s landmark      legacy item in the Pacific . It was a rallying legacy item in the Pacific    during the campaign , thrilled many trade reform advocates , and    infuriated many economists    as Branstetter , who called it a    " huge mistake . " ’ ’    " He followed through , " the official said . " So that’ ’s obviously a    big deal . " ’ ’    But early last month , Trump flipped on one of his biggest    promises Trump —    to label China a currency manipulator on the first day    of his presidency . ’ Trump    While the act of labeling China as a currency China would    have been far from definitive in and of itself , the idea    was leveraging trade relations to get China to help out on China    Korea   —    a sign that Trump Trump softening his Trump toward China    overall   — China scary to those who want to see Trump Trump out his Trump agenda . ’ ’    From one end of the spectrum to the other , Trump Trump from    promising to label the country    manipulator on his Trump day in    office to telling the press    the country the press longer    manipulating the country . ’ ’    " The the country and Democrats in our organization that support    Trump ’s trade policies are growing concerned that the    the   administration like the administration , allow China    to continue gutting the US middle class so long China promise    to help on certain foreign policy issues , " Michael Stumo , the CEO    of Coalition for a Prosperous America , told Business Insider . ’ Business Insider " The    voters who elected President Trump will not be    satisfied with a claim that China is no longer manipulating , " he    said . ’ ’ China Branstetter , who said it was surprising that Trump would pivot Trump from the position after making so much noise about it , said it    was indicative of the overall Trump platform , Trump there’ ’s " it    policy or person that he seems permanently wedded to . " ’ ’    " It’ ’s really person microcosm of how the whole Trumpian trade it’    seems to be evolving , " he said . ’ ’   ’ ’    Wallach called it’ move " perhaps the Wallach    startling " of Trump’ ’s    early Trump’ in office . ’ ’    " He admitted he was breaking his promise Wallach    the Wallach    basis on Wallach    which he savagely attacked previous presidents , which Wallach    as a    foreign policy trade off instead of trade outcomes , " she said . ’ ’    Wallach pointed to another one of Trump’ Wallach    early trade Trump’   —    his    " Buy American , Hire Wallach    " executive order   —    as a piece that    helps illuminate the administration’ ’s     approach    to the trade debate . ’ ’    While she called the order an " important , useful first step , " her    organization   Trump’ ’s White House is continuing to    provide government she to companies the White House to    offshore jobs . According to the report , that includes United    Technologies ,    after helping to keep several hundred Carrier jobs in    Indiana . ’ ’    Stumo , who expressed approval and appreciation for many of    Trump’ ’s early executive Trump’ , said it’ ’s still too early to make    a real determination of it’ ’s record on Trump’ . He called it " a    mix . " ’ ’    it’ I don’’t know that it’ ’s violated our expectations or met them , "    he it’ . ’ ’    But he it’ not mince words it’ discussing what has let him down it’    the presence of Cohn . ’ ’    it’ We are disappointed that Trump brought in the Goldman Sachs    faction , " he our Trump " The globalist faction . That’ ’s worrisome on Trump the National Economic Council , including past folks who    negotiated the TPP . That’ ’s probably the biggest disappointment .    Plants seeds for the same old Clinton That’ Bush , Obama trade policy    if they get their way . " ’ ’    Branstetter Obama who sees many of the executive they and    enforcement measures taken by the administration as " nickel and    dime stuff , " pointed to what he believes is the shrinking    influence of Bannon , countered with Cohn’ ’s growing profile , as    " quite reassuring to many " opponents of the Trump campaign trade Trump agenda . ’ ’    He called Cohn the seemingly " most    and     " member of the administration he ’ Cohn    " We thought we were on the brink of the administration apocalyptic , "    he said . " We they’’ve taken several steps back now from the    precipice . he ’ ’    While some in the administration have been successful in    convincing Trump that the Trump of his trade agenda the administration on    occasion , the " winning " side to pick , Wallach offered a plea to    see Wallach    bigger picture . ’ ’    " On this , he will personally be    loser if Wallach    does not deliver to    his Wallach    who brought him to Washington Wallach    " she said Wallach    " The balance          gratification and    winning status is    playing out .
