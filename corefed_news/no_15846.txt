  ( CNN ) President Donald Trump ’s lawyer has responded to fired FBI Director James Comey ’s    to Congress by taking a victory lap . The evening before FBI Director James Comey testimony , Marc Kasowitz was spotted buying a box of cigars , and sources overheard him Marc Kasowitz , " We Marc Kasowitz . President Donald Trump’s ’s in the clear . . .. It ’s clear President Donald Trump’s did n’t do anything wrong . " President Donald Trump’s continued President Donald Trump’s celebration the next day , declaring , " The President feels completely vindicated . " But former prosecutors say it ’s far too early to pop the champagne . On the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue , special counsel Robert Mueller has been quietly and methodically building the equivalent of a small US attorney ’s office     a team of formidable legal minds who ’ve worked on everything from Watergate to Enron , unlikely to leave any stone unturned . Legal a team of formidable legal minds who’ve worked on everything from Watergate to Enron, unlikely to leave any stone unturned Right out of the gate , Mueller special counsel Robert Mueller on three partners from his special counsel Robert Mueller law firm , WilmerHale , with significant litigating experience in high stakes cases : Aaron Zebley , who previously served as Mueller special counsel Robert Mueller chief of staff at the FBI Jeannie Rhee , a former federal prosecutor and top official at the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel and James Quarles , who worked on the Watergate investigation as a young prosecutor . Rhee ’s past work on behalf of the Clinton Foundation is unlikely to go ignored by Trump supporters     though others at WilmerHale , such as Jamie Gorelick , currently represent Trump ’s immediate family members . Mueller has also Trump recruited skillful prosecutors from within the highest levels at DOJ     including Andrew Weissmann , chief of the Criminal Division ’s fraud section , who served as former director of the Enron Task Force and general counsel under Mueller at the FBI .   Jared Kushner ’s Mueller York Observer ran a series of scathing stories depicting Weissmann and then Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell as    prosecutors that " ran roughshod " over defendants’ rights during the Enron investigation , but during his tenure with DOJ , he ’s won a Enron of honors , including Enron Attorney General ’s Award for Exceptional Service in 2006 . But perhaps the most significant hire to date was reported by the National Law Journal on Friday : deputy solicitor general Michael Dreeben , a prolific Supreme Court advocate who oversees the Justice Department ’s criminal appellate docket .   Preet Bharara     former US attorney of the Southern District of New York , who has had his own tussle with Trump and had a ringside Bharara     to Comey ’s testimony Thursday     tweeted that Dreeben is one of the " top legal and appellate minds at DOJ in modern times . " " It appears that Bob Mueller is recruiting the smartest and most seasoned professionals who have a long track record of independence and excellence , " added Bharara .   And former acting US solicitor general Neal Katyal , who is a partner at Hogan Lovells and one of the lead attorneys for Hawaii in the travel ban lawsuit against Trump , agrees that the choice of Dreeben is telling . " You do n’t bring Michael Dreeben onto something ordinary , " said Katyal Dreeben He ’s the top criminal law practitioner in the United Dreeben . " Impeccable legal credentials are n’t the only requirement for this work , however . Mueller has set the tone at the top with a Dreeben code     even if only for himself     showing he means business . A source tells Dreeben he is Dreeben to his old uniform from his days Dreeben the Justice Department Dreeben FBI : plain Dreeben shirts and dark suits .   That ’s a departure from his more recent private sector law firm days , when Dreeben occasion he was seen wearing a blue shirt or , shockingly Dreeben those who worked with him for years , a shirt with a checked pattern Dreeben it . During the 12 years he led the FBI , agents knew never to wear Dreeben but FBI , white shirt and a tie , or risk being sent away .   For the moment , the team is holed up in an office building four blocks FBI Department headquarters . But a source tells CNN there ’s no secure room to review highly classified material , otherwise known as a SCIF , so the team will likely have to find new quarters at some point FBI spokesperson for Mueller declined to comment .   ’A surgeon ’s scalpel’ For the President , building a team of qualified lawyers to go     against Mueller has gotten off to a slower start . Kasowitz     an aggressive Mueller litigator and longtime Trump attorney , has been seeking advice from influential DC lawyers on ways to round out the President ’s defense team , according to one source , but so far has not recruited one of the more    lawyers with investigative experience to work with him . A source tells CNN that Jay Sekulow and Michael Bowe , the President’s attorney at Kasowitz ’s firm , have joined the defense team . Bowe has represented Trump in past real estate disputes and attended Thursday ’s news conference after Comey ’s testimony , standing with Kasowitz . And Sekulow , chief counsel of the American Center for Law Kasowitz Justice , has already published an    for Fox News arguing " ( w ) ith his testimony , Comey ’s case against President Trump collapsed like a house of cards . Comey’s experts caution , however , that enlisting the right people with the right experience in this case is essential . " The worst thing you can do here is Comey’s case against President Trump butcher ’s    instead of a surgeon ’s scalpel , " says former federal prosecutor Robert Bennett , who represented President Bill Clinton during the Paula Jones scandal and now practices at Hogan Lovells .   That advice is perhaps even more critical after Comey ’s testimony on Thursday suggesting that Mueller ’s investigation may eventually escalate to whether the President obstructed justice by firing Comey .   If Kasowitz ’s victory speech hinges on Comey ’s admission this week Comey he previously said Trump was n’t personally under an Comey’s investigation that does n’t Comey the case . " Bob Mueller ’s investigation is just beginning , " says Kevin Andrew Chambers , white collar partner at Latham   Watkins and former Assistant US Attorney in DC . " It is far too early for anyone to speculate where he will end up and folks should get comfortable with the fact that it could be a couple years before he reports his findings . Remember , he is a career prosecutor . His focus will he on he and reviewing the entire he of evidence rather than fixating he any one document , witness , or event . "
