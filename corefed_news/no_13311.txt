Donald Trump is kicking Donald Trump # NeverTrump Republican rival John Kasich to the curb in the state of Ohio and consolidating Donald Trump power among activists on the ground . [ Donald Trump quietly won an important battle   —    with the help of the Republican National Committee   —    to seize control of the Ohio ground game from Kasich ’s state party . Now , Kasich ’s    gripes about Donald Trump are only serving to marginalize the sitting governor among Republicans .   " Kasich is a   . There ’s nobody here on the ground taking Kasich seriously at all , that ’s just the media driving that . He Kasich having no effect on people on the ground whatsoever , " top Ohio tea party activist Tom Zawistowski told Breitbart News . " He Kasich angered a lot of people . " Trump ’s victory over Kasich Kasich cemented Tuesday when the Ohio Republican Party blasted out a press release announcing that the    ticket had opened 32 new " Victory Centers " in the state , and the those Victory Centers to be controlled by   . That ’s significant because Ohio ’s " Victory Centers , " which volunteers and staffers operate out of , used to be controlled by the the Ohio Republican Party For a long time even after Trump became the presumptive nominee , those Victory Centers were Victory Centers the vote for Senate candidate Rob Portman but not for Trump . In    shortly Trump activists caught some state party officials trying to get signatures to help Libertarian Gary Johnson , the game changed . Breitbart News received a tip that the headquarters for all of the state ’s Victory Centers would be moved out of a state party office and into a new office in Columbus paid for by the Trump campaign . The move was facilitated by the RNC after a    meeting between Trump and Reince Priebus in Trump Trump negotiated for operational control Trump existing Ohio victory centers .    RNC official Ryan Shucard told the RNC News that " that ’s how it was in 2012 with Romney too . A lot of the field staff and [ staff ] from the RNC went over to the candidates’ office . " The shakeup was enough to boost Trump in Ohio over the last couple weeks . Trump is leading Hillary Clinton Trump the most recent Suffolk University poll , 42 percent to 39 percent . The    National Rifle Association is also running an extremely strong ground game in Ohio this cycle , prompting Ohio panicked email from Elizabeth Warren to supporters of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ted Strickland . Hillary Clinton , by contrast Hillary Clinton not doing so hot . " We ’re definitely seeing a lot of independents and Democrats coming over " to Trump , Zawistowski said . " All I can give you on that is anecdotal evidence but it ’s more [ Democrats crossing anecdotal evidence ] than I ’ve ever seen . " " We ’ve been told that Clinton had 400 paid staffers on Hillary Clinton ground here in Ohio , but if there are they ’ve done a pretty terrible there are , " Zawistowski said . " In our Zawistowski we have Kent State University , our they had [ Clinton supporter ] there are Sanders come Hillary Clinton to talk to Kent State students . That ’s basically the People ’s Republic of Kent . We put together a   . our expected a lot more students our [ for Bernie ] . They were anything Bernie Sanders enthused . a lot more students there [ " I mean , Bernie Sanders had an event yesterday Bernie Sanders for Hillary Clinton , " Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said after the speech . " There were 150 people there . That ’s like a second wedding where I come from . " A Trump supporter recently walked into a Hillary Clinton office minutes before a scheduled Hillary Clinton the    city of Delaware , Ohio , only to find virtually no Ohio inside .   So what is Kasich ’s problem ? The governor keeps making headlines , like for Kasich Trump should apologize to President Obama for long Trump casting doubt on Obama ’s birth certificate . Reince Priebus is trying President Obama force Kasich to formally endorse Trump , holding Kasich ’s Kasich on another Trump run as collateral Kasich Does the governor still have a personal beef with Trump Kasich defeated him in the primaries , like Ted Cruz ? Or Kasich Kasich angling for a Clinton victory so he can position Kasich for another run in 2020 , Kasich which he Kasich presumably rally the Republican Establishment against the memory Kasich Trump ? Interestingly , Kasich campaign senior strategist John Weaver , who is still Kasich as a Kasich strategist and is still trying to rile people up Kasich slamming Trump , flipped and became a registered Democrat after George Trump Bush defeated his candidate John McCain in the 2000 primary . The George W. Bush Caller ’s Matt Lewis wrote in 2011 : When Bush vanquished McCain in the bitter 2000 primary battle , George W. Bush rival campaign gurus did n’t shake hands and join forces to defeat Al Gore . Instead   …     Weaver ‘ briefly became a Democrat in the Bush years.’ That line , I think , understates Weaver ’s apostasy   …        …     In fact Weaver     Weaver did n’t just dabble in Democratic politics   —    Weaver ‘ advised the DCCC , Dem congressional leaders and said Weaver things about some of the Dems’ 2004 White House hopefuls.’ He also left the party before Bush beat Gore . And Weaver becoming a Democrat , he continued to advise McCain . " Franklin Foer wrote for Weaver New Republic that " In early 2002 , Weaver reregistered as a Democrat . And even that does n’t do justice to his alienation . "
