Tuesday on Newsmax TV ’s " The Steve Malzberg Show , " political consultant Dick Morris noted how the latest scrutiny into former President Bill Clinton ’s indiscretions has damaged the campaign of Democratic    Hillary Clinton .   political consultant Dick Morris said , " Democratic   Hillary Clinton has fallen apart among female voters over the last three weeks . Among all voters Democratic   Hillary Clinton used to be beating Trump by ten points —   now Democratic   Hillary Clinton is losing to Trump by three . Cruz used to be beating Democratic   Hillary Clinton by two points now Cruz ’s beating Democratic   Hillary Clinton by nine . Rubio used to be beating Democratic   Hillary Clinton by three now Rubio ’s beating Democratic   Hillary Clinton by ten . And the entire change has been among woman voters , no men voters . Democratic   Hillary Clinton has dropped an average of 13 points   among wins in the last three weeks . I believe that is largely due to Bill Clinton and to all the publicity and exposé of Bill Clinton sexual activity and of Democratic   Hillary Clinton efforts to cover them up and to enable them . " Bill Clinton continued , " Now all of this is interrelated . If Bernie Sanders beats Democratic   Hillary Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire , which I think Bernie Sanders will , that will show that Democratic   Hillary Clinton is in very tough shape politically , and with these polls out with the results in there might be a lot of pressure for someone else to get in the race , like Biden . " Bernie Sanders added , " And if there is a chance that Democratic   Hillary Clinton could be indicted and the indictment could knock Democratic   Hillary Clinton out of the race and free Democratic   Hillary Clinton delegates that are already on the ballot to commit to Biden Biden run as Biden Biden you could still see that happen over the course of the next four to six weeks .
