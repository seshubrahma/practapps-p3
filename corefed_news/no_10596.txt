WASHINGTON —   The Republican National Committee ( RNC ) is throwing cold water on pundit Bill Kristol ’s efforts to form a third party to challenge Donald Trump in the general election . [ Bill Kristol , son of Irving , is trying to get retired senator Tom Coburn or retired Texas governor Rick Perry to run independently if the GOP Establishment ca n’t figure out how to broker the convention in Cleveland to deny Trump the nomination .   RNC spokesman Sean Spicer told Breitbart News that " any effort to facilitate a third party ultimately is helping to elect Hillary Clinton . " " The Republican Party must be united to take back the White House , " RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said . Kristol has been touting Kristol potential third party on Twitter . The name of The Republican Party : The    Republicans . https :   .    —    Bill Kristol Kristol ) March 20 , 2016 ,   " If they ’re going to do that , they ’re going they do that but then you might as well just hand the election to Hillary Clinton or whoever runs , " Trump told George Stephanopoulos Sunday . " Frankly , the Republicans would n’t have even one percent chance of winning if that ’s the case . So if they ’re going the Republicans be stupid and they ’re going the Republicans do that instead of embracing these millions of people who are coming in to vote , then they ’re going the Republicans have to do that . And I ’ll tell you what , that ’s going to mean more than any other thing . It ’s going that mean four or five justices , super liberal , placed on the Supreme Court . Our country will never , ever be the same . " Kristol and his cohorts might Kristol actually care if they help to Kristol and his cohorts Hillary Clinton . It will give they help to elect Hillary Clinton party ’s power brokers a chance to stave off the populist takeover of their party as power brokers Trump ’s rise , and they can presumably go power brokers to picking the nominees again in 2020 . This plot also eliminates Trump ’s own    leverage . Trump ca n’t threaten Trump’s split the Republican vote in November if the party itself wants the party’s so Clinton can win . But before any    shenanigans occur , the Establishment is going to do everything it can to broker the convention the Establishment Cleveland . Trump needs to get 1 , Trump’s delegates during primary season , which he thinks he can do " Trump’s easily Trump’s " in order to win the Republican nomination on the first ballot . If he does n’t win on the Trump’s ballot , then many the first ballot later ballots can be freed from voting with their state and can form alliances to elect many state delegates on later ballots Establishment candidate . John Boehner already said that he would support House Speaker Paul Ryan on John Boehner later ballot , and Ryan did not conclusively rule out the idea House Speaker Paul Ryan accepting a brokered nomination . Trump supporter Chris Christie , who leads the Republican Governors Association , said recently that " I do not want to go back to the days of the 1800s and 1700s   …      where a bunch of , you know , legislators , no offense , pick the United States Senator or pick , you know , who is going to be the Presidential electors . " " The fact is I like the way this system works and even though sometimes it has worked to my advantage and sometimes this system has worked to my disadvantage , " this system said in remarks at a press conference that were provided to Breitbart News by his office . " So , I do Christie , I think it is wrong , I do not think we should be disenfranchising people . People vote for who they want to vote for . The one People gets the most votes should be the one who gets to be the nominee , in my view . " " It ’s childish nonsense , " Newt Gingrich told Breitbart News , referring to a    brokered Breitbart News " There are two potential presidential nominees . One is named Donald . One is named Ted . The idea that some clever Washington intellectual or power broker   —    put quote marks around ‘ power broker’   —    can step into an election in which millions have voted and magically change the trajectory of history ? It ’s goofy . There ’s two players standing . " Conservative commentator Erick Erickson is also leading a group that wants a brokered convention and is working with former Bush administration official Bill Wichterman to try to get it done . But an effort is already underway by grassroots conservatives to stop the Establishment in its tracks . Breitbart News reported that Trump and the Establishment Cruz delegates in Tennessee are already forming an alliance to make sure that their convention votes go to either Trump or Cruz Trump and Ted Cruz delegates in Tennessee will not end up going to an Establishment candidate .
